#### NATO is the primary hand of the U.S. capitalist machine -- extending rentier capitalism by securing markets through interactions for military bases -- Only Workers based revolt can challenge the imperialism of the capitalist machine

**AL TARIQI '22** (A. "What is NATO? Why do we call for its
dismantling?", originally posted on the Socialist Resurgence's website,
marzo 26, 2022,
https://litci.org/en/what-is-nato-why-do-we-call-for-its-dismantling///HHW)

In previous posts and in our work in **[the Revolutionary
Socialist]{.underline}** Network, **[Workers]{.underline}**' Voice and
Socialist Resurgence, along with our RSN comrades, **[have
stated]{.underline}** our **[unequivocal opposition to the Russian
aggression in Ukraine]{.underline}** and our support for the
self-defense of the Ukrainian people. **[We demand the immediate
withdrawal of Russian troops]{.underline}** from Ukraine and call for
solidarity with Russian antiwar protesters, for an end to their
repression, and for an immediate release of all detainees.

Does this mean that we support calls emanating from North America and
Europe in support of further military expansion in Europe and the
ongoing arms race? Does this mean that we support NATO? Unequivocally,
we say no. **[[The barbarity of the Russian invasion tempts those who
oppose it to launder the reputation of NATO]{.mark} and of the U.S.
imperialist project at its heart]{.underline}**, **[[to concede to false
narratives about its supposed defensive nature rather than its true
character as an aggressive and imperialist
alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A look at its history and current
function as a creature of US imperialism is necessary to combat such
illusions.

NATO: A brief history

The origins of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) go back to
1948, when the United Kingdom, France, and the Benelux countries
(Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg) formed a military alliance out of
fear of potential German and Soviet aggression after World War II. By
1949, the founding members began to see this as insufficient. Soon
thereafter, the United States and Canada joined. Subsequently, the
alliance formed three commands: Europe, the Atlantic, and the English
Channel (the last dissolved in 1994). France withdrew from military
participation in 1966, rejoining in 2009.

When West Germany was admitted in 1955, the USSR responded by forming
the Warsaw Pact, giving the lie to the original NATO founders'
perception of Soviet aggression. As Marxist geographer David Harvey
explains, "Cultivating fear (both fake and real) of the Soviets and
Communism was instrumental to this (cold war) politics. The economic
consequence has been wave after wave of technological and organizational
innovation in military hardware."

The arms industry---a form of monopoly capitalism often referred to as
the "military-industrial complex"---has always been at the heart of
NATO, as it sought to balance the numerical superiority of the Warsaw
Pact's armed forces with technological superiority, including medium
range nuclear weapons.

**[Article 5 of the NATO treaty states that an attack on any signatory
would be regarded as an attack on the other members]{.underline}**. This
"collective defense" pact was first invoked in 2001 following the Sept.
11 attacks on the United States. Currently, 30 countries are NATO
members, 28 of which are in Europe (the U.S. and Canada are the two
non-European members). The most recent entrant is North Macedonia, a
former Yugoslav province, admitted in May 2020. **[[NATO's courting of
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**---especially after the Western-supported
2013-2014 "Euromaidan" protests and the 2014 Russian annexation of
Crimea---all the **[while maintaining that it refuses to directly
militarily intervene there, [has]{.mark} g[enerated the ambiguity
contributing to the current crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It]{.mark}
[also [coincided with the increase of Ukraine's debt with the IMF and
the application of neoliberal austerity policies.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

After the collapse of the USSR in 1991, **[[the Warsaw Pact was
dissolved but NATO kept growing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Since the late
1990s it has expanded to 14 new countries. **[This military encroachment
has been largely naturalized by U.S. and European governments as a
guarantee of peace, but its root causes have not been really
explained]{.underline}**. In the United States, the likes of **[The New
York Times and PBS]{.underline}** have been among the worst in this
regard, **[constantly drilling audiences with Pentagon talking points
and focusing almost entirely on issues of logistics rather than the
larger geopolitical context]{.underline}**.

Instead, **[[we offer]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[a materialist
explanation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[specifically contextualizing
NATO's aims both within U.S. imperialist ambitions and within the
emergence of rentier capitalism]{.mark} since the 1990s]{.underline}**.
To summarize, as many have discussed, **[[the U.S. regime rejected a
"peace dividend]{.mark}" after the defeat of the USSR]{.underline}**[.
**[This is puzzling only when we fail to consider how central to U.S.
capitalist profits both the expansion of]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[U.S.
[military bases]{.mark} since World War II [and the military-industrial
complex]{.mark} since the 1990s have been.]{.underline}**

U.S. imperialism and expansion of bases

At the time of this writing, U.S. President Joe **[[Biden is
visiting]{.mark} Europe [for]{.mark} an emergency [NATO
summit]{.mark}]{.underline}**, along with meetings of the G7 and the
European Council, **[in what the bourgeois media is depicting as an
"honor lap" of sorts]{.underline}** **[after the shambolic Trump
years.]{.underline}** Read without the fog of bourgeois sentimentality,
**[[European capitalist politicians are welcoming Washington
back]{.mark} as their prodigal king]{.underline}**. This trip occurs in
the immediate aftermath of Biden's pledge to devote \$3 billion from the
\$13.6 billion Ukraine "aid" package to increase U.S. NATO troops in
Europe, and another \$700 million to support Foreign Military Financing
and to foster U.S. counter-espionage activities ISR (intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance). **[[This move can only be seen by the
Russians as an escalation]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

As of July 2021, **[[the U.S. operates]{.mark} about [750 bases
in]{.mark} at least [80 countries]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[and spends
more on its military than the next 10 countries
combined]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Since the Pentagon publishes incomplete
data, the number of bases may be even be higher. **[[A significant
number of these bases are located in NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** member
**[[countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**: Germany (119 bases), Italy (44),
the UK (25), Portugal (21), Turkey (13), and Belgium (11). Moreover, the
U.S. deploys approximately 173,000 troops in 159 countries. Again, NATO
member states host a large proportion, at least 60,000, of these troops,
with the following breakdown: Germany (33,948), Italy (12,247), UK (over
9000), Spain (over 3000), Turkey (1600+), Belgium (1000+), and Norway
(700+).

Interestingly, **[one of the agenda points of [Biden's
summit]{.mark}]{.underline}** with the **[Europeans [will]{.mark} be to
[discuss NATO's long-term deployment plans]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
1997 **[the U.S. and Russia signed an agreement in which the U.S.
promised not to deploy troops permanently in frontline
states]{.underline}**. In 2014, **[after Russia annexed Crimea, the U.S.
began to exert a military presence [in both Poland and the Baltic
states]{.mark}, but "in rotating deployments to honor the letter of that
agreement]{.underline}**," as reported by the Guardian. However**[, the
Russian invasion of Ukraine has voided the deal, in the eyes of the U.S.
and its NATO allies. Now [the U.S. is pushing for permanent
basing]{.mark}, which has long been the desire of the Baltic
states.]{.underline}**

**[[The idea that]{.mark} U.S. [bases]{.mark} and troops intervene in
foreign countries to [provide security and]{.mark} to [promote]{.mark}
human [rights is belied by the real history]{.mark} of U.S.
bases]{.underline}**, **[as]{.underline}** described in an excellent
book, "**[Bases of Empire]{.underline}**," edited by the anthropologist
and director of the Cost of War Project, Catherine Lutz. As Lutz shows,
U**[.S. [bases have many functions, none of which promote the security
or]{.mark} human [rights]{.mark} of host populations]{.underline}**. For
example:

• Basing comes with Status of Forces Agreements
**[(SOFAs]{.underline}**), not just with NATO countries but anywhere
Uncle Sam goes. These **[grant U.S. soldiers immunity from local
laws]{.underline}**.

• **[Bases expand U.S. military capacity to wage
war]{.underline}**---for example, when the U.S. used its bases in Guam,
Thailand, and Philippines during the Vietnam War.

• **[Bases provide "R&R" for invading U.S. soldiers]{.underline}**,
inflicting the misogyny and racism of many of these troops on local
populations.

• **[The CIA used secret bases in Laos to ship heroine to U.S. troops in
Vietnam]{.underline}**.

• Bases facilitate the shipment of U.S. materiel to its theaters of
invasion and intervention.

• **[Bases enable the U.S. to manipulate local governments and to exert
influence on them to change laws in the interests of U.S.
capital]{.underline}**.

• **[[Base agreements]{.mark} often [come with]{.mark} U.S. investment
and [trade treaties tying countries into U.S. trade]{.mark} relations
[and]{.mark} [forcing]{.mark} liberalization and
[privatization]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[The ultimate goal of NATO today is to secure]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the support of governments allied to the U.S. in the region, offer
so-called "protection" and IMF/WB "financing" in exchange for
[**[austerity policies and privatization, as well as pushing forward
imperialist policies abroad which benefit U.S. capital]{.underline}**.
**[It is a military alliance to back a concrete economic and political
project.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

All of this helps explain why **[[Biden and NATO see the Russia war on
Ukraine as an opportunity to escalate imperialist
intervention]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, it is not just old school
military intervention and basing that is at play. Since the 1970s**[,
U.S. imperialism has morphed into]{.underline}** something more indirect
yet equally sinister: **[the promotion of rentier
capitalism]{.underline}**.

Rentier capitalism: Minerals, militarism, and FIRE

**[The decline in U.S. manufacturing generated a profitability
crisis]{.underline}**, going back to the early 1970s. **[To revive
profitability, U.S. capitalism shifted toward "rentier"
sectors]{.underline}** **[such as the arms industry]{.underline}** (aka.
The military-industrial complex or MIC), **[finance-insurance-real
estate]{.underline}** (FIRE), **[and oil, gas, and mineral
extraction]{.underline}** (OGM). **[Rent-seeking capital]{.underline}**,
as opposed to surplus-value generating capital---for example,
manufacturing or agriculture---**[seeks profits through monopolization
of property]{.underline}**, whether in the form of resources, financial
assets, or so-called intellectual property. Often, **[rent-seeking
capital is described as the search for profit without the contribution
of social value]{.underline}** (think of the activities of your typical
sleazy landlord).

Rent-seeking capital, specifically the MIC, FIRE, and OGM sectors, has
risen to dominance in the United States over the past generation, and
the promotion of these sectors has been the raison d'etre both of
domestic national politics and of NATO in that time. Since 1991, **[[the
alliance has primarily served U.S. interests]{.mark}, shifting European
and other U.S. allies' focus from their domestic spheres toward that of
U.S. "national security.]{.underline}**" As economist Michael Hudson has
explained, **[[NATO has become]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in effect,
**[[Europe's foreign policy ministry, dominating domestic economic
interests.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

"**[Rejection of the peace dividend]{.underline}**,"seen in Marxist
terms, **[refers to the fear of the U.S. ruling class losing control
over NATO and dollar-area states as they have sought increased trade
with both Russia and China]{.underline}**. MIC interests such as
**[[Raytheon, Boeing, and Lockheed-Martin generate their profits]{.mark}
from "monopoly rent," specifically [from sales to NATO countries and
Middle East oil exporters]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[These companies'
stocks rose sharply right after the Russian
invasion]{.underline}**]{.mark}, explains Hudson.
**[Germany]{.underline}**, for example, **[announced that it will raise
arms spending to over 2 percent of GDP.]{.underline}**

Meanwhile, **[[the Nordstream 2 pipeline]{.mark} connecting Russia with
Central and Western Europe [has been seen as a major threat by the U.S.
energy capitalist sector]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Exerting intense
pressure on European countries]{.mark}, especially Germany, [to remain
in U.S.-controlled supply networks]{.mark} and, more generally,
isolating Russia (and Iran) from global energy markets, [have been
important motives for U.S. policy]{.mark}]{.underline}** in recent
years.

Finally, there is **[FIRE]{.underline}**: Its profits **[are generated
primarily through land rents paid to the banks in the form of mortgage
interest and debt amortization]{.underline}** (the paying off of debt
over time in principal and interest). Approximately **[80 percent of US
and UK bank loans go to the real estate sector]{.underline}**, in whose
interest it is to maximize "capital gains" from rising land rent and the
privatization of economies, inserting rent-seeking monopolies into
public services, education, health care, and transport.

It is these three sectors of capital that dominate both domestic
politics in the United States and NATO policy in Europe. **[[None of
this is to say that we agree with the campist line that Russia, or
China, represent]{.mark} some sort of balance of power, let alone [an
emancipatory alt]{.mark}ernative [to]{.mark} the [NATO-]{.mark}dominated
world order. In this clash between competing imperialisms, it is the
workers both of Ukraine and of Russia that stand to suffer
most]{.underline}**. **[[No
workers]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[**[Ukrainian, Russian, or
otherwise---have an interest in either of the imperialist
camps]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

**[[Just as the working class is the only class that produces the wealth
of society, it is the only social force that can permanently end
wars]{.mark}.]{.underline}** We therefore agree with and amplify the
statement by our comrades in the Revolutionary Socialist Network:
"**[[It's the internationalist solidarity of the workers of the world,
in total independence of imperialist powers, that can force the retreat
of Russian troops and put an end to these wars by overthrowing our own
ruling classes."]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[Indications of]{.mark} this [failure of capitalism]{.mark} are
**[everywhere]{.mark}**. [Stagnation of investment]{.mark} punctuated by
[bubbles of financial expansion]{.mark}, which then inevitably
burst]{.underline}, now characterizes the so-called free market.4
[**[Soaring inequality]{.mark} in income and wealth** has its
counterpart in the declining material circumstances of a majority of the
population]{.underline}. Real [[wages]{.mark} for most workers in the
United States have [barely budge]{.mark}d in forty years]{.underline}
despite steadily rising productivity.5 [Work intensity has increased,
while work and safety protections on the job have been systematically
jettisoned]{.underline}. Unemployment data has become more and more
meaningless due to a new institutionalized underemployment in the form
of contract labor in the gig economy.6 Unions have been reduced to mere
shadows of their former glory as capitalism has asserted totalitarian
control over workplaces. With the demise of Soviet-type societies,
social democracy in Europe has perished in the new atmosphere of
"liberated capitalism."7

The capture of the [**[surplus]{.mark} value [produced by]{.mark}
over[exploited populations]{.mark} in the poorest regions** of the
world]{.underline}, via the global labor arbitrage instituted by
multinational corporations, is leading to an [unprecedented amassing of
financial wealth at the center of the world economy and relative poverty
in the periphery]{.underline}.8 Around \$21 trillion of offshore funds
are currently lodged in tax havens on islands mostly in the Caribbean,
constituting "the fortified refuge of Big Finance."9 Technologically
driven monopolies resulting from the global-communications revolution,
together with the rise to dominance of Wall Street-based financial
capital geared to speculative asset creation, have further contributed
to the riches of today's "1 percent." [Forty-two billionaires now enjoy
as much wealth as half the world's population]{.underline}, while the
three richest men in the United States---Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and
Warren Buffett---have more wealth than half the U.S. population.10 In
every region of the world, inequality has increased sharply in recent
decades.11 [The [gap in]{.mark} per capita [income]{.mark} and wealth
between the richest and poorest nations]{.underline}, which has been the
dominant trend for centuries, [is **[rapidly widening]{.mark} once
again**.]{.underline}12 [More than 60 percent of the world's employed
population, some two billion people, now work in the impoverished
informal sector, forming a massive global proletariat]{.underline}. The
global reserve army of labor is some 70 percent larger than the active
labor army of formally employed workers.13

[[Adequate **health care**, **housing**]{.mark}, **education**,
[and]{.mark} clean **[water]{.mark}** and **air** are **[increasingly
out of reach]{.mark}** for large sections of the
population,]{.underline} even in wealthy countries in North America and
Europe, while [transportation is becoming more difficult in the United
States and many other countries]{.underline} due to irrationally high
levels of dependency on the automobile and disinvestment in public
transportation. [Urban structures are more and more characterized by
gentrification and segregation, with cities becoming the playthings of
the well-to-do while marginalized populations are shunted
aside]{.underline}. About [[half a million]{.mark} people, most of them
children, are [homeless]{.mark} on any given night [in the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates.14 New York
City is experiencing a major rat infestation, attributed to warming
temperatures, mirroring trends around the world.15

[In the United States and other high-income countries, **[life
expectancy]{.mark} is [in decline]{.mark}**, with a remarkable
resurgence of Victorian illnesses related to poverty and
exploitation]{.underline}. In Britain, gout, scarlet fever, whooping
cough, and even scurvy are now resurgent, along with tuberculosis. [With
[inadequate enforcement of work health and safety]{.mark}
[regulations]{.mark}, black lung disease has returned with a vengeance
in U.S. coal country.]{.underline}16 [Overuse of antibiotics,
particularly by capitalist agribusiness, is leading to an
antibiotic-resistance crisis, with the dangerous growth of
superbugs]{.underline} generating increasing numbers of deaths, which by
mid--century could surpass annual cancer deaths, prompting the World
Health Organization to declare a "**[[global health
emergency]{.underline}]{.mark}**."17 [These dire conditions, arising
from the workings of the system, are [consistent with]{.mark} what
Frederick Engels, in the Condition of the Working Class in England,
called "**[social murder]{.mark}**]{.underline}."18

At the instigation of giant corporations, philanthrocapitalist
foundations, and neoliberal governments, public education has been
restructured around corporate-designed testing based on the
implementation of robotic common-core standards. This is generating
massive databases on the student population, much of which are now being
surreptitiously marketed and sold.19 The corporatization and
privatization of education is feeding the progressive subordination of
children's needs to the cash nexus of the commodity market. We are thus
seeing a dramatic return of Thomas Gradgrind's and Mr. M'Choakumchild's
crass utilitarian philosophy dramatized in Charles Dickens's Hard Times:
"Facts are alone wanted in life" and "You are never to fancy."20 Having
been reduced to intellectual dungeons, many of the poorest, most
racially segregated schools in the United States are mere pipelines for
prisons or the military.21

[More than [two million people in the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [are [behind
bars]{.mark}, a higher rate of incarceration than any other country in
the world, constituting a new Jim Crow]{.underline}. The total
population in prison is nearly equal to the number of people in Houston,
Texas, the fourth largest U.S. city. [African Americans and Latinos make
up 56 percent of those incarcerated, while constituting only about 32
percent of the U.S. population]{.underline}. Nearly 50 percent of
American adults, and a much higher percentage among African Americans
and Native Americans, have an immediate family member who has spent or
is currently spending time behind bars. [Both [black]{.mark} men [and
Native American men]{.mark} in the United States are nearly [three
times]{.mark}, Hispanic men nearly two times, [more likely to die of
police shootings]{.mark} than white men.22 **[Racial divides]{.mark} are
now [widening]{.mark} across the entire planet.**]{.underline}

[Violence against women and the expropriation of their unpaid labor, as
well as the higher level of exploitation of their paid labor, are
integral to the way in which power is organized in capitalist
society]{.underline}---and how it seeks to divide rather than unify the
population. More than a third of women worldwide have experienced
physical/sexual violence. [Women's bodies, in particular, are
objectified, reified, and commodified as part of the normal workings of
monopoly-capitalist marketing]{.underline}.23

[The mass media-propaganda system, part of the larger corporate matrix,
is now merging into a social media-based propaganda system that is more
porous and seemingly anarchic, but more universal and more than ever
favoring money and power.]{.underline} Utilizing modern marketing and
surveillance techniques, which now dominate all digital interactions,
[vested interests are able to tailor their messages, largely unchecked,
to individuals and their social networks, creating concerns]{.underline}
about "fake news" on all sides.24 Numerous [business entities promising
technological manipulation of voters]{.underline} in countries across
the world have now surfaced, auctioning off their services to the
highest bidders.25 The elimination of net neutrality in the United
States means further concentration, centralization, and control over the
entire Internet by monopolistic service providers.

Elections are increasingly prey to unregulated "dark money" emanating
from the coffers of corporations and the billionaire class. Although
presenting itself as the world's leading democracy, the United States,
as Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy stated in Monopoly Capital in 1966, "is
democratic in form and plutocratic in content."26 In the Trump
administration, following a long-established tradition, 72 percent of
those appointed to the cabinet have come from the higher corporate
echelons, while others have been drawn from the military.27

[[War, engineered by the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [and other major powers at the apex of the
system, has [become]{.mark} [perpetual]{.mark} in strategic oil regions
such as the Middle East, and [threatens to escalate into]{.mark} a
**[global thermonuclear exchange]{.mark}**]{.underline}. During the
Obama administration, the [United States was engaged in **wars/bombings
in seven different countries**]{.underline}---Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria,
Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan.28 [Torture and assassinations have
been reinstituted by Washington as acceptable instruments of
war]{.underline} against those now innumerable individuals, group
networks, and whole societies that are branded as terrorist. [A [new
Cold War and **nuclear arms race**]{.mark} **is [in the making]{.mark}**
between the United States and Russia]{.underline}, while Washington is
seeking to place road blocks to the continued rise of China. The Trump
administration has created a new space force as a separate branch of the
military in an attempt to ensure U.S. dominance in the militarization of
space. Sounding the alarm on the increasing dangers of a nuclear war and
of climate destabilization, the distinguished Bulletin of Atomic
[Scientists moved its [doomsday]{.mark} clock in 2018 to two minutes to
midnight, the [close]{.mark}st since 1953, when it **marked the [advent
of thermonuclear weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}.29

[Increasingly severe [economic sanctions]{.mark} are being

states]{.underline}, while racist barriers against immigration continue
to be erected in Europe and the United States as some [60 million

risen to 250 million, with those residing in high-income countries
constituting more than 14 percent of the populations of those countries,
up from less than 10 percent in 2000. Meanwhile, [ruling circles and
wealthy countries seek to wall off islands of power and privilege from

The good news is that **[even if there might not be visible changes for
a long time, this work is not undertaken for nothing]{.underline}**.
Think back to the development and also ignition phase in the s-curve.
**[[Each choice to do differently, each questioning]{.mark} of the
stated purpose or reasons, [impacts]{.mark} the former reference
[frameworks, mind-sets and knowledge reservoirs]{.mark}. It [offers
alternative meaning, delegitimizes the notion that there are no
alternative claims, and offers ideas about other ways of]{.mark} acting
or [doing things]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Of course much structural power
rests with those who benefit from the status quo and its hegemonic
paradigm. But **[as Meadows wrote, many individuals--- change [research
suggests about 60 % of people in a system---are open minded and willing
to learn]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[This is where radical]{.mark}]{.underline}** incremental
**[[transformation]{.mark} [begins]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as
illustrated nicely in Fig. 5.1. It stems from Ray Ison, professor of the
Systems for Sustainability program at the Monash Sustainability
Institute in Australia. I was fortunate enough to sit next to him at a
conference on decoupling human well-being from resource use and after my
presentation he told me he had just finished an article that he felt was
relevant to my thinking. The following illustration (Fig. 5.1) is indeed
spot on, even though his terminology is of course different:

Ison's article summarizes 14 years of experience in transdisciplinary
research on system innovation processes. As a result, he and his
colleagues put "social learning" at the heart of their framework:
**[[humans engage in making sense of a situation by socially
constructing the issue]{.mark} at stake. [Through this process they
either reify or change both their understanding of a situation and the
practices in which they engage. Sometimes this entails amending the
institutional setup]{.mark}]{.underline}** (made visible as elements of
a situation in the right hand graph). Change and dynamic adaptation is
the normal state of being in a complex living system. So **[[each
alternative viewpoint, each act done differently, amends the framework
for action in the future]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

So, in essence, **[[we]{.mark} [can]{.mark}no[t]{.mark} [not be part of
changing the world]{.mark}. [The decision that lies with us concerns our
choice to become aware of this and use it intentionally]{.mark}--- even
if cause and effect are not always visible or impressive. Over time and
through collective or concerted action, the situational amendments
transform the system in question even if each shifting from one dynamic
stage to another is in itself not very radical or
disruptive]{.underline}** (here indicated as S1 to Sn in the left hand
graph). As part of this process, the boundaries of one system may also
be adjusted and thence the scope of what a particular transformation
process involves.

So **[[each questioning sparks thought processes in others]{.mark}---[an
inspiration or irritation that influences]{.mark} the [dynamics]{.mark}.
[Each silence might be interpreted as others please]{.mark}. And we
never know when exactly that last incremental activity necessary to
prompt a social or ecological tipping point for wider and
deeper---radical---regime changes occurs. [Social scientists' research
findings suggest that 10 percent of the people in any given system
provides the critical mass where new ideas or opinions start spreading
rapidly]{.mark}]{.underline}** (SCNARC 2011).

In order to strategically influence these permanently ongoing processes
of learning and adaptation, **[[it is important to open up a target
system: to assess and understand the crucial path]{.mark} dependencies
[and which purpose or generative imaginary they are
serving]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This involves infrastructures and
technologies, as STS **[[research]{.underline}]{.mark}** would point
out, the ecological embeddedness that SES approaches highlight, and the
**[[enforceable laws, role definitions, and mind-sets that

### Fiated Movement Alternative\-\--1NC

#### The alternative is an affirmation of the Communist Party -- dual power is uniquely key to accountability mechanisms and connection of communities to foster a movement for international liberation.

HHW)

I would argue that [within the base building movement, there is a move
towards party organizing,]{.underline} but this trend has not always
been explicitly theorized or forwarded within the movement. My goal in
this essay is to argue that [[base building and dual power]{.mark}
strategy can be **[best forwarded through party organizing]{.mark}**,
and that party organizing can [allow]{.mark} this emerging [movement to
solidify into]{.mark} a powerful [revolution]{.mark}ary socialist
tendency in the United States.]{.underline} One of the crucial insights
of the base building movement is that the current state of the left in
the United States is one in which revolution is not currently
possible[.]{.underline} There exists very little popular support for
socialist politics. [A [century of]{.mark} [anticommunist
propaganda]{.mark} has been extremely effective in [convinc]{.mark}ing
even the most oppressed and marginalized that [communism has nothing to
offer]{.mark} them]{.underline}. [The base building emphasis on **[dual
power responds directly]{.mark} to this insight**. By building
institutions which can meet people's needs, we are able to concretely
demonstrate that communists can offer the oppressed relief from the
horrific conditions of capitalism.]{.underline} Base building strategy
recognizes that [actually doing the work to serve the people does
infinitely more to create a socialist base of popular
support]{.underline} than electing democratic socialist candidates or
holding endless political education classes can ever hope to do. Dual
power is about proving that we have something to offer the oppressed.
The question, of course, remains: once we have built a base of popular
support, what do we do next? [If it turns out that [establishing
socialist institutions]{.mark} to meet people's needs does in fact
**[create sympathy towards]{.mark} the cause of [communism]{.mark}**,
how can we mobilize that base?]{.underline} Put simply: [in order to
mobilize the base which base builders hope to create, we need to have
already done the work of building a communist party**.**]{.underline}
[It is not enough to simply meet peoples needs. Rather, we **must build
the institutions of dual power in the name of communism.**]{.underline}
[We must refuse covert front organizing and instead have a public face
as a communist party.]{.underline} When we build tenants unions, serve
the people programs, and other dual power projects, we must make it
clear that we are organizing as communists, unified around a party, and
are not content simply with establishing endless dual power
organizations. [We must be clear that our [strategy is
revolutionary]{.mark} and in order to make this clear we **[must adopt
party organizing]{.mark}**. By "party organizing" I mean an
organizational strategy which adopts the party model.]{.underline} Such
organizing focuses on building a party whose membership is formally
unified around a party line determined by democratic centralist decision
making. [The party model creates [internal methods]{.mark} for
**[holding party members accountable]{.mark}**, unifying party member
action around democratically determined goals, and for educating party
members in communist theory and praxis.]{.underline} A communist
organization utilizing the party model works to build dual power
institutions while simultaneously educating the communities they hope to
serve. [Organizations which [adopt]{.mark} the party model [focus on
propagandizing]{.mark} around the need for [revolutionary
socialism]{.mark}. They function as the forefront of political
organizing, empowering local communities to theorize their liberation
through communist theory while organizing communities to literally fight
for their liberation.]{.underline} A party is not simply a group of
individuals doing work together, but is a formal organization unified in
its fight against capitalism. [Party organizing has much to offer the
base building movement]{.underline}. By working in a unified party, base
builders can ensure that local struggles are tied to and informed by a
unified national and international strategy. While the most horrific
manifestations of capitalism take on particular and unique form at the
local level, we need to remember that [our struggle is against a
material base which functions not only at the national but at the
international level. The formal structures provided by a democratic
centralist party model allow individual locals to have a voice in open
debate, but also allow for a unified strategy to emerge from democratic
consensus. Furthermore, **party organizing allows for local
organizations and individual organizers to be held accountable for their
actions.**]{.underline} [It allows criticism to function not as one
independent group criticizing another independent group, but rather as
comrades with a formal organizational unity working together to sharpen
each others strategies and to help correct chauvinist ideas and
actions.]{.underline} In the context of the socialist movement within
the United States, such [**[accountability is
crucial]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [As a movement which operates within a
settler colonial society, imperialist and colonial ideal frequently
infect leftist organizing. **Creating formal unity and party procedure
for dealing with and correcting these ideas allows us to address these
consistent problems** within American socialist organizing.]{.underline}
Having a formal party which unifies the various dual power projects
being undertaken at the local level also allows for base builders to not
simply meet peoples needs, but to pull them into the membership of the
party as organizers themselves. The party model creates a means for
sustained growth to occur by unifying organizers in a manner that allows
for skills, strategies, and ideas to be shared with newer organizers.
[It also allows community members who have been served by dual power
projects to take an active role in organizing by becoming party members
and participating in the continued growth of base building
strategy]{.underline}. It ensures that there are formal processes for
educating communities in communist theory and praxis, and also enables
them to act and organize in accordance with their own local conditions.
We also must recognize that the current state of the base building
movement precludes the possibility of such a national unified party in
the present moment. Since base building strategy is being undertaken in
a number of already established organizations, it is not likely that
base builders would abandon these organizations in favor of founding a
unified party. Additionally, it would not be strategic to immediately
undertake such complete unification because it would mean abandoning the
organizational contexts in which concrete gains are already being made
and in which growth is currently occurring. What is important for base
builders to focus on in the current moment is building dual power on a
local level alongside building a national movement. This means aspiring
towards the possibility of a unified party, while pursuing continued
local growth. The movement within the Marxist Center network towards
some form of unification is positive step in the right direction. The
independent party emphasis within the Refoundation caucus should also be
recognized as a positive approach. It is important for base builders to
continue to explore the possibility of unification, and to maintain
unification through a party model as a long term goal. In the meantime,
[individual base building organizations ought to adopt party models for
their local organizing. Local organizations ought to be building dual
power alongside recruitment into their organizations, education of
community members in communist theory and praxis,]{.underline} and the
establishment of armed and militant party cadres capable of defending
dual power institutions from state terror. Dual power institutions must
be unified openly and transparently around these organizations in order
for them to operate as more than "red charities." Serving the people
means meeting their material needs while also educating and
propagandizing. It means radicalizing, recruiting, and organizing. [The
[party model remains the most useful method]{.mark} for achieving these
ends.]{.underline} The use of the party model by local organizations
allows base builders to gain popular support, and most importantly, to
mobilize their base of popular support towards revolutionary ends, not
simply towards the construction of a parallel economy which exists as an
end in and of itself. [It is my hope that we will see future unification
of the various local base building organizations into a national
party,]{.underline} but in the meantime we must push for party
organizing at the local level. If local organizations adopt party
organizing, [it ought to become clear that a **[unified national party
will have to be the long term goal]{.mark} of the base building
movement.**]{.underline} Many of the already existing organizations
within the base building movement already operate according to these
principles. I do not mean to suggest otherwise. Rather, my hope is to
suggest that we ought to be explicit about the need for party organizing
and emphasize the relationship between dual power and the party model.
Doing so will make it clear that the base building movement is not
pursuing a cooperative economy alongside capitalism, but is pursuing a
revolutionary socialist strategy capable of fighting capitalism.

and sinking. Both the producers and consumers are facing the crises in
their everyday lives.

**[The follies of globalisation and its flickers continue to be in
denial mode]{.underline}**. These **[illiberal charlatans of power live
in the cocoons of their privileged ghettos]{.underline}** **[and argue
vehemently]{.underline}** **[that the current crisis is not a capitalist

capitalist globalisation by [hiding its absolute

peace and prosperity.

The globalisation of crises under capitalism serves four objectives of
the ruling and non-ruling classes. Firstly, **[these ridiculous
propaganda makes people reject the state]{.underline}** and government
they have formed with the help of their collective will. Secondly, it
**[diminishes citizens faith in their own abilities and own
intellect.]{.underline}** It weakens and diverts them to analyse and
reflect on their own realities. Thirdly, **[it weakens the state and
destroys the capabilities of the governments as instruments of social,
economic, political and cultural change]{.underline}** for common good
based on scientific spirit and progressive future. Finally, **[it
destroys democratic cultures by replacing it with authoritarianism that
is concomitant with the requirements of capitalism for its
growth.]{.underline}** In this way, the fake narratives of reactionary
politics and global capitalism helps to achieve these four specific
objectives, which are central pillars in establishing authoritarianism
accelerated by crises. The globalisation of capitalist crises means
globalisation of authoritarian politics and vice versa.

**[[The world is facing]{.mark} six major immanent capitalist
crises]{.underline}** i.e. i) Coronavirus pandemic led global
**[[health]{.mark} crises]{.underline}**, ii) **[[environmental]{.mark}
crises]{.underline}**, iii) **[[economic]{.mark} crises]{.underline}**,
iv) **[[political]{.mark} crises]{.underline}**, v) **[[military]{.mark}
crises]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** vi) **[[crises]{.mark} of
governance]{.underline}**. **[These six crises are integral to each
other. One crisis triggers the other. It is impossible to address them
separately]{.underline}**. Therefore, it **[needs an integrated and
pluriversal approach to understand and address these crises together and
find reliable alternatives.]{.underline}**

**[Coronavirus pandemic led global health crises]{.underline}**

**[The [Coronavirus]{.mark} pandemic [reveals]{.mark} that spill over of
[virus]{.mark} from their natural habitat]{.underline}**
**[to]{.underline}** **[human body]{.underline}** **[[is associated
with]{.mark} the burgeoning [wildlife trade]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[deforestation]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[loss of
natural wildlife habitat]{.underline}** **[due to over [exploitation of
nature under capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The monetisation of
nature for profit is the foundation of health pandemics.]{.underline}**

According to a recent research, two viruses enter into human body from
their natural hosts every year for a century now. The
**[Coronavirus]{.underline}** led health crisis and other forms of
global health crises are products of capitalism, which **[considers
human body and nature as resources to be used for the expansion of
capitalist profit. It also uses sickness as]{.underline}** **[business
opportunities]{.underline}** **[for health insurance and]{.underline}**
**[pharmaceutical corporations]{.underline}**. **[The [profit driven
healthcare]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[economic
system [breeds health crises]{.mark} across the globe]{.underline}**.
The Coronavirus led pandemic is aggravating existing health crises due
to privatisation of public health infrastructures and corporatisation of
health services. The alternative is to look at health as human rights
and abandon the economic model that seeks profit from illness and
business of sickness. **[The nationalisation and universalisation of
healthcare is the only alternative.]{.underline}**

**[Environmental crises]{.underline}**

**[The unprecedented environmental crisis is not natural]{.underline}**.
**[The environment is degraded and destabilised by]{.underline}** the
**[growth]{.underline}** of a desire-based society **[under
capitalism]{.underline}**. The magnitude and severity of environmental
crisis reveals that capitalist economic system creates grave imbalance
within the ecosystem by over exploiting natural resources. **[From
[global warming]{.mark} to pollutions]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[contaminations [are the]{.mark} [products
of]{.mark} the [productivist]{.mark} and utilitarian [ideology of
capitalism, which monetised the]{.mark} [environment for]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** **[maximisation of [profit]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It
has ruined the land, water and air. The outbreak of air and waterborne
diseases are products of environmental crisis manufactured by capitalist
system. **[The irreparable damage to environment is [a threat to]{.mark}
human [lives]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The environmental crisis aggravates
global economic and health crisis. **[The reversal of profit driven
desire-based capitalist economy is inevitable for a sustainable economic
and social future.]{.underline}**

**[Economic crises]{.underline}**

**[[Economic crisis is integral to capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[[The]{.mark} faux neoliberal [narrative of austerity]{.mark} as
an]{.underline}** **[economic policy alternative [to recover]{.mark}
from economic crisis is the logic of market on steroids]{.underline}**.
**[[Austerity]{.underline}]{.mark}** is not an economic policy but it
**[is an economic project of the capitalist classes,]{.underline}**
**[which [enforces]{.mark} economic [miseries]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[political despondency]{.underline}** **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}**
social **[[alienation]{.underline}]{.mark}** on majority of population.
**[The voodoo of austerity and its alconomics culture [reproduces
crisi]{.mark}s and empowers market forces]{.underline}** **[by
transferring public resources to the]{.underline}** **[private pockets
of the capitalist classes]{.underline}**. The only way to recover from
the crisis in short run is to abandon austerity driven neoliberal
economic policies. **[The permanent alternative from crisis is to
destroy capitalism and all its]{.underline}** **[cultures with the help
of popular struggles for a sustainable economy and society based on
community and democratic control over resources.]{.underline}**

**[Political crises]{.underline}**

**[The neoliberal shift in economy led to the shift from welfarists
social democracy to]{.underline}** **[bourgeois
democracy]{.underline}**, **[where uninhibited market forces rule with
their invisible free hand]{.underline}**. The growth of island of
prosperity and continents of miseries are the net outcomes of such a
system, which **[led to the declining legitimacy of the democratic
political forces. In this context, there is the rise of reactionary
religious and conservative social forces]{.underline}** **[are not only
filling the vacuum]{.underline}** **[but also providing legitimacy to
the rule of capitalist politics in the name of culture, religion, and
nationalism]{.underline}**. **[The recent political
upheavals]{.underline}** **[within liberal democracies]{.underline}** in
different parts of the globe **[reflects this right-wing shift and
reactionary trend in politics]{.underline}**. **[[The political crisis
is an opportunity for the capitalist classes to dismantle]{.mark} all
[democratic norms]{.mark} and values]{.underline}** **[in support of
authoritarianism.]{.underline}** In this decisive period of structural
crisis of capitalism, it is only authoritarian politics that can help
capitalism to further accumulate at this stage of its growth. **[The
collective politics with collective vision is the only alternative for
the survival of the masses.]{.underline}**

**[Military crises]{.underline}**

**[The authoritarian and [reactionary political regimes breed
conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[disputes]{.underline}**
[**[and]{.underline}** **[wars]{.underline}**
**[to]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[stay in power and control
resources]{.mark}. The global growth of nationalist war hysteria
is]{.underline}** **[producing military crises]{.underline}** in land,
ocean, air and space. **[It is also fuelling international arms
trade]{.underline}**. The colonial, imperialist and capitalist powers
consider military crisis is an opportunity to expand their economic base
by selling weapons of mass destruction. The guns and capitalist
globalisation move together. The military-industrial complex is
deepening the idea of security state led by the defence forces that
ensures security to capital at the cost of human lives. The states and
governments are spending all their resources on military equipment when
citizens are suffering in hunger and homelessness. The military crisis
puts citizens welfare in the dustbin. **[The global growth of defence
spending is a threat to environment,]{.underline}** **[human
lives]{.underline}**, **[peace]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[prosperity]{.underline}** in the world.

Crises of governance

The world is witnessing the growing crisis of global, regional, national
and local governance. The crisis of governance means crisis of rule of
law, transparency and accountability. The criminogenic character of
capitalism prefers a non-transparent and unaccountable system, which
provides absolute freedom to the mobility of capital and control labour
and its mobility with different legal mechanisms. The laws are for the
masses and the capitalist classes live with legal impunity. This
capitalist duality is central in creating crisis of governance. The
growth of economic and social inequalities, rise of political
illegitimacies and illiberal thoughts are also led to the crisis of
governance. The struggle for liberal, progressive, egalitarian,
cooperative and democratic governance is the only alternative which is
destroyed by capitalism in regular intervals.

**[These]{.underline}** six **[crises are intrinsic capitalism to
overcome its own internal contradictions]{.underline}**. **[The
different incarnations of capitalism reveal that capitalism is an
incubator of crises]{.underline}**. **[[There is no alternative]{.mark}
to solve crises [within capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
**[globalisation]{.underline}** is the diminuendos of capitalist world
economy, which **[promised peace and prosperity but in]{.underline}**

### General FW

### Ontology Framework\-\--2NC

#### Interpretation: Evaluate the ontology of the capitalist 1AC's advocacy prior to material simulations of government action.

#### [Logic]{.underline}\-\--no one has the agency to enact the plan, but we can control the orientation of our political subjectivities and direct them either toward or against neoliberalism. 

#### [Pedagogy]{.underline}\-\--the substance of the K is offense: students must be aware of how ideas either challenge or strengthen apparatuses of violence. Ignoring the question in favor of plan focus is self-defeating and complicit with evil, impact-turning the justification for their framework at its most basic level.

#### Ontology comes first -- the false epistemic consciousness of a western world permits colonialism. Only thorough recognizing the multiplicity of worldviews can the matrix of colonial power be broken.

[As hinted throughout this article, [developing the ontological
sensitivity required to break]{.mark} with the seal-sealing [logic of
modern metaphysics poses]{.mark} a [daunting challenge]{.mark} to social
scientists]{.underline}. Verran reminds us that even [critical
[scholarship]{.mark} customarily [embraces]{.mark} **'the false
episte[mic consciousness of science]{.mark} [\[that\] permits its
colonialist commitment]{.mark}** to a spatial
universalism']{.underline}.86 Our sense is that existing [calls for
pluralising IR, important as they are for the future of the field, [fall
short of]{.mark} charting the moves necessary to [undue]{.mark} the
production of a [colonial one-world world]{.mark}]{.underline}. Doing
difference differently (meaning generatively and in good faith)
[**[requires more than engaging]{.mark} [across perspectives]{.mark} on
a single world**; we need also to envision mechanisms for a
cosmopolitics practiced both as diplomatic relations between worlds and
collaborative revealing of knowledge that decolonises
science.]{.underline}

[Although promising, the Global IR project too readily slips back into a
'one-world world' by recognising a multiplicity of worldviews but not
the existence of many reals]{.underline}. [The [awakening called
for]{.mark} by a decolonial science demands, first and foremost, that
[attempts to tame ontological]{.mark} moments of [rupture]{.mark} and
disconcertment as **[different ways of seeing, believing or
knowing]{.mark} the [same reality]{.mark} be resisted so that we can
bring the pluriverse into view**]{.underline}. Though perhaps generative
of more sensitive epistemologies, this [mistaking of ontology as
epistemology founders because it turns to familiar concepts and
presumptions about the human condition and nature that **erase
alternative worlds**]{.underline}. In contrast, the [[provocation posed
by a pluriversal]{.mark} IR is [not just that we hold other ways of
knowing]{.mark} the world accountable to 'our' positivist, scientific or
academic criteria for authoritative science]{.underline}. How we know
reality is not the only issue at stake, but, rather, what reals we
confront. Such a shift entails [moving away from questions of who has
the power to represent the world in certain ways towards examination of
the ontological politics at play in creating (and suppressing) the
worlds within with the study of specific problems and political action
itself take place.]{.underline}

**[[The decolonial project]{.mark}/science that we have described [works
to puncture]{.mark} single-world ([colonial) logics that render
human]{.mark} (and non-human) [experience as singular]{.mark} and the
same]{.underline}**, while upholding the idea that 'becoming worldly'
demands that we 'become with many'.87 [Contrary to the incredulity and
[uneasiness]{.mark} often [expressed]{.mark} towards forms of practice,
including knowledge-building and politics, in which ancestors, spirits
and earth-beings partake, [respond]{.mark}ing [effectively]{.mark} and
respectfully to the pluriverse presumes that we **[learn to bend]{.mark}
in the face of and to [walk with others]{.mark} in the cosmos, thinking
and being beyond the familiar**]{.underline}.88 Similarly, and perhaps
in a language more familiar to our eyes, if worlds are made, the
[challenge that remains is to imagine creative and meaningful forms of
reciprocity and collaborative practice that **might [be the basis for
forging connection and mutually supportive relations across ontological
difference.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

**Enframing DA\-\--contesting neoliberalism via ontological politics is
necessary to solve the enframing of the subject and the world that is
the root cause of the case.\
Anna Grear 20,** （Cardiff law professor, "Resisting anthropocene
neoliberalism: Towards new materialist commoning?"
https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/200757722.pdf 3. Commons and Commoning
as Ontological Politics Escobar, primarily an anti-globalization AND
-Capitalocene.）

To appreciate fully the decisive importance of commons as ontological
politics, it seems important to locate reflection in the contemporary
situation. **[This is, after all, the situation in which
[anti-capitalist commoning seeks to resist capitalist enclosures,
appropriations and captures]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The contemporary era
is often referred to as "Anthropocene," which is a widely deployed term
for **[a "new age of man" in which the human species has become a
geological, rather than just a biological]{.underline}**, force.75 The
terminology is etymologically drawn from **[Anthropos (man) and kainos
(new)---and was first popularized in 2002.]{.underline}**76 It is
important to remember, however**[, that despite the notion that the
"anthropos" of the Anthropocene is a species figuration, in reality, it
is not.]{.underline}** 77 Moreover, as Haraway has pointed out, the
Anthropocene is intrinsically coupled with the scale of the "global,"
and the "global" is highly specific in its origins and development.78 In
reality**[, the [Anthropocene reflects highly uneven historical
processes of colonization]{.mark}]{.underline}**[79 **[and rampant
capitalist neocolonialit]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[y]{.underline}**. 80
So specific---indeed---**[is the "global" folded into the Anthropocene
that the "Anthropocene" is also identified by some as the
"Capitalocene."]{.underline}**81 I will use the term
**["[Anthropocene-Capitalocene]{.mark}" to foreground the [uneven
origins]{.mark} and contemporary [mal-distribution]{.mark} of
Anthropocene climate and environmental fallouts]{.underline}**; **[the
[fundamentally colonial capitalist imperatives driving the continuing
structural dominance of the fossil-fuel]{.mark} economy; 82 [extensive,
and continuing, corporate enclosures in the Global South]{.mark}; 83 and
the pervasive and expanding commodification and technification of
"nature]{.underline}**."84 So much is at stake**[.
[Neoliberalism]{.mark} is now [the dominant engine of the
Anthropocene-Capitalocene]{.mark}]{.underline}**: **[it enacts violence
extensively visited upon communities, individuals, places, animals,
ecosystems and other lively materialities either in the way of or
(alternatively) in the sights of, neoliberal agendas]{.underline}**. The
**[[colonizing of multiple life-worlds]{.mark} at stake in neoliberal
accumulation [reiterates, and builds on]{.mark}, earlier [patterns of
ontological (and epistemological) violence85]{.mark} [underlying
Eurocentric power]{.mark} distributions of the international legal
order.]{.underline}** 86 More fundamentally, **[n[eoliberal]{.mark}
accumulative rationalism [ultimately relies]{.mark}---as Weber and
Escobar both either state or imply---upon a [central, binary set of
severed ontological relations between "humans" and "nature," between
"subject" and "object". Ontology is at the heart of the current sets of
crises.]{.mark} The wellrehearsed, uneven, and entirely predictable
mal-distributions of life and death characterizing the
Anthropocene-Capitalocene thus draw upon the same fundamental
ontological splits as have long operated in the service of Eurocentric,
masculinist, colonizing power.]{.underline}** 87 In the
Anthropocene-Capitalocene, neoliberalism's biopolitical/necropolitical
logics are driving a potential terminus---including for human beings. As
Stengers puts it in In Catastrophic Times, 88 **[[human beings face,
potentially "the death of what we have called a civilization]{.mark}
\[---and, she reminds us---\] there are many manners of dying, some
being more ugly than others."89 [Even death itself]{.mark}---the great
leveler---[is]{.mark} [unevenly distributed]{.mark}, whether as terminus
or process.]{.underline}** **[[Neoliberalism actively exploits the
notion that there is no other solution to the enormity of the problems
confronting humanity---and, accordingly, constructs the illusion that
there is no alternative to neoliberal managerial eco-governance on a
planetary scale]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Indeed, Stengers argues that
**[even "radical uncertainty with regard to the catastrophes that \[the
current crisis\] is likely to produce . . . won't make the capitalist
machine hesitate, because it is incapable of hesitating: it can't do
anything other than define every situation as a source of
profit]{.underline}**."90 **[The logics of consumptive capitalism will
continue to insist---in short---that "the techno-industrial capitalist
path is the only one that is viable]{.underline}**"91 in the face of the
Anthropocene-Capitalocene planetary crisis**[. [The ascendancy of such
logic is already evident in the growing popularity of ethically
dubiou]{.mark}s]{.underline}**92 commitments to geo-engineering as a way
of techno-fixing the climate, irrespective of the risks involved. **[93
Such hubristic strategies amount to a form of risky gambling with the
futures of millions, 94 and reveal the vulnerability of "humanity in its
entirety \[to being\] taken hostage" by capitalist profit making
"solutions" for the otherwise (supposedly) insoluble: "In this way, an
'infernal alternative' \[is\] fabricated at the planetary scale: either
it's us, your saviours, or it's the end of the world."]{.underline}**95
Against such horizons, [it is all the more **[urgent for commoning to
offer multiple forms of resistance]{.underline}**.]{.mark} The dangers
for the commons, however, are pervasive: panoptic governance and
neoliberal eco-managerialism already subvert, as we have seen, some
commons for pro-capitalist ends, and in the final analysis, **[there is
absolutely nothing to guarantee that any commons will be, or remain,
immune from capture]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[\[t\]here isn't the
slightest guarantee that we will be able to overcome the hold that
capitalism has over us (and in this instance, what some have proposed
calling "capitalocene," and not anthropocene, will be a geological epoch
that is extremely sho]{.underline}**rt). Nor do we know how, in the best
of cases, we might live in the ruins that it will leave us: **[the
window of opportunity in which, on paper, the measures to take were
reasonably clear, is in the process of closing.]{.underline}**96 If the
Anthropocene-Capitalocene leaves a window of opportunity in the process
of closing, **[[ontology as politics could not be more decisively
important or timely---and commoning has never been more urgent as a
dynamic of ontological resistance.]{.underline}]{.mark}** What, then,
might New Materialism offer to commons thought in the face of such
struggles? And how does New Materialism offer agentic significance to
the more-than-human? And why might that matter in the calculus of
resistance to neoliberalism's voracious colonization of lifeworlds?

### Epistemology Framework\-\--2NC

#### Interpretation: The judge should evaluate the research practices and pedagogical implications of the 1AC's capitalist advocacy prior to material simulations of government action.

#### [It's fair]{.underline}\-\--it preserves aff choice while holding them accountable for choices made regarding the presentation and construction of the 1AC

#### [Most logical\-\--]{.underline}no one has the agency to enact the plan, but we can control the orientation of our political subjectivities and direct them either toward or against neoliberalism\-\--ignoring how ideas either challenge or strengthen apparatuses of violence is both self-defeating and complicit with evil, impact-turning the justification for their framework at its most basic level.3

#### Epistemology comes first - competing positions educate us and amend the framework

The good news is that **[[even if there might not be visible
changes]{.mark} for a long time, [this work is not undertaken for
nothing]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Think back to the development and also
ignition phase in the s-curve. **[[Each choice to do differently, each
questioning]{.mark} of the stated purpose or reasons, [impacts]{.mark}
the former reference [frameworks, mind-sets and knowledge
reservoirs]{.mark}. [It offers alternative meaning, delegitimizes the
notion that there are no alternative claims, and offers ideas about
other ways of]{.mark} acting or [doing things]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Of
course much structural power rests with those who benefit from the
status quo and its hegemonic paradigm. But **[as Meadows wrote, many
individuals--- change [research suggests about 60 % of people in a
system---are open minded and willing to learn]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[This is where radical]{.mark}]{.underline}** incremental
**[[transformation]{.mark} [begins]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as
illustrated nicely in Fig. 5.1. It stems from Ray Ison, professor of the
Systems for Sustainability program at the Monash Sustainability
Institute in Australia. I was fortunate enough to sit next to him at a
conference on decoupling human well-being from resource use and after my
presentation he told me he had just finished an article that he felt was
relevant to my thinking. The following illustration (Fig. 5.1) is indeed
spot on, even though his terminology is of course different:

Ison's article summarizes 14 years of experience in transdisciplinary
research on system innovation processes. As a result, he and his
colleagues put "social learning" at the heart of their framework:
**[[humans engage in making sense of a situation by socially
constructing the issue]{.mark} at stake. [Through this process they
either reify or change both their understanding of a situation and the
practices in which they engage. Sometimes this entails amending the
institutional setup]{.mark}]{.underline}** (made visible as elements of
a situation in the right hand graph). Change and dynamic adaptation is
the normal state of being in a complex living system. So **[[each
alternative viewpoint, each act done differently, amends the framework
for action in the future]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

So, in essence, **[[we]{.mark} [can]{.mark}no[t]{.mark} [not be part of
changing the world]{.mark}. [The decision that lies with us concerns our
choice to become aware of this and use it intentionally]{.mark}--- even
if cause and effect are not always visible or impressive. Over time and
through collective or concerted action, the situational amendments
transform the system in question even if each shifting from one dynamic
stage to another is in itself not very radical or
disruptive]{.underline}** (here indicated as S1 to Sn in the left hand
graph). As part of this process, the boundaries of one system may also
be adjusted and thence the scope of what a particular transformation
process involves.

So **[[each questioning sparks thought processes in others]{.mark}---[an
inspiration or irritation that influences]{.mark} the [dynamics]{.mark}.
[Each silence might be interpreted as others please]{.mark}. And we
never know when exactly that last incremental activity necessary to
prompt a social or ecological tipping point for wider and
deeper---radical---regime changes occurs. [Social scientists' research
findings suggest that 10 percent of the people in any given system
provides the critical mass where new ideas or opinions start spreading
rapidly]{.mark}]{.underline}** (SCNARC 2011).

In order to strategically influence these permanently ongoing processes
of learning and adaptation, **[[it is important to open up a target
system: to assess and understand the crucial path]{.mark} dependencies
[and which purpose or generative imaginary they are
serving]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This involves infrastructures and
technologies, as STS **[[research]{.underline}]{.mark}** would point
out, the ecological embeddedness that SES approaches highlight, and the
**[[enforceable laws, role definitions, and mind-sets that
political]{.mark} economist [emphasize.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Competing Ideologies Framework \-\--2NC

#### Interpretation: The ballot decides the desirability of capitalism

#### It's educational -- Our links prove that capitalism is the central ideological question of the resolution, which is meaningful educational ground for both sides

#### It's fair -- You get to weigh the aff as a reason cap is good, and if you can't defend cap good on the NATO topic, you deserve to lose \-- AL TARIQI proves that Post Warsaw Pact NATO exists to promote western capitalist goals

#### Pluralistic universalism is needed to upset the colonialist power imbalance of the west's monistic universalism.

reveal deep provincialism. How can we think of the Cold War as a

#### [We solve Education]{.underline} best- 

#### [Broadening Horizons]{.underline} - Centering the debate around major assumptions taken by the 1AC [radically widens]{.underline} our exposure to [better perspectives]{.underline}.

#### [Strategy testing]{.underline}\-\--plan focus [artificially]{.underline} narrows the range of alternatives by simplifying [eight minutes of scholarship]{.underline} into an [eight second plan text]{.underline}.

**[Key to Fairness]{.underline}**

#### Neg Flex - The K and framework are crucial weapons to preserving fairness on the NATO topic. Their interpretation turns fairness offense.

#### Provides Aff ground -- Debating movement solvency is better ground than nebulous "rejection" alternatives, that also turn education by preventing discussions of real alternatives. 

#### And, if we win FW No Perms -- 1. They deck education and fairness - a "demilitarize K" incoherently wouldn't compete against a heg good aff if the plan withdraws troops, AND 2. "overwhelm the link" arguments thrash clash and education by combining ideologically polarized political options.

#### Clash and fairness are [wrong]{.underline}:

#### 1. [PREDICTABILITY]{.underline}. Cap good/bad is one of the [oldest,]{.underline} [vibrant]{.underline}, and [most researched]{.underline} philosophical debates in history. **[Especially]{.underline} predictable because we're on the camp's packet.**

#### 2. [SIDE BIAS]{.underline}. No ground loss, because YOU have the [prep advantage]{.underline} AND [choose the topic]{.underline}.

#### 3. [STRUCTURAL FAIRNESS]{.underline}. Disparities in speed, experience, and camps all prove fairness is [not]{.underline} the [primary motivation]{.underline} for the activity.

#### 4. Debate is [SELF-CORRECTING]{.underline}. The AFF's dystopia of an unfair wasteland is [incoherent]{.underline}, because the [best]{.underline} teams will [adapt]{.underline} (by investing in research that propels capitalism [less]{.underline}). At worst, ground loss is [temporary]{.underline}, meaning education outweighs.

#### 5. [INTERP SOLVES]{.underline}. Only Ks about [capitalism]{.underline} are allowed, and you can weigh your aff. {#interp-solves.-only-ks-about-capitalism-are-allowed-and-you-can-weigh-your-aff. .Analytics}

#### It's not a [hard]{.underline} standard to meet\-\--our interp isn't "any risk of a link," but asks whether the aff is [more capitalist]{.underline} than [anti-capitalist]{.underline}. {#its-not-a-hard-standard-to-meet---our-interp-isnt-any-risk-of-a-link-but-asks-whether-the-aff-is-more-capitalist-than-anti-capitalist. .Analytics}

### Theory\-\--AT: Multi-Actor\-\--2NC {#theory---at-multi-actor---2nc .ABlock}

#### Multi-actor fiat:

#### 1. [FRAMEWORK IS OFFENSE]{.underline}. If we should reject capitalism, that [precedes]{.underline} fairness, and the [only]{.underline} important issue is [how]{.underline} to take it down. 

#### 2. [PREDICTABILITY]{.underline}. Most anti-capitalist literature advocates for [global movements]{.underline}.

#### 3. [YOU LINK TOO]{.underline}. Enactment and enforcement of the plan includes the [millions]{.underline} of members in the federal government. 

#### 4. [NEG FLEX]{.underline}. Cross-apply it.

#### 5. [ARBITRARINESS]{.underline}. Non-resolutional theory is [impossible]{.underline} to predict. Aff teams will [continue]{.underline} to shift the goalpost towards interps that are [marginally]{.underline} better for debate. 

### Theory\-\--AT: Utopian Etc\-\--2NC {#theory---at-utopian-etc---2nc .ABlock}

#### Yes, it's [unlikely]{.underline} and [fanciful]{.underline}\-\--that's [good]{.underline}:

#### 1. [EDUCATION]{.underline}\-\--opening our minds to the politics of the possible allows us to develop [novel]{.underline} ideas about how to challenge macropolitical structures.

#### 2. [RECIPROCITY]{.underline}\-\--debate [encourages]{.underline} utopian visions of the world. Constraining our proposals to the [politically feasible]{.underline} ruins the game for both sides.

#### 3. [LOGIC]{.underline}\-\--proposing a problem without a solution encourages [resentful]{.underline} and [fruitless]{.underline} subjects.

#### 4. [AFF GROUND]{.underline}\-\--if the neg can fiat a revolution, you get [instant]{.underline} access to impact turns. Otherwise, alternatives become [vague]{.underline} and [shifty]{.underline}, which makes your job [harder]{.underline}.

### Theory\-\--AT: Perf Con\-\--2NC {#theory---at-perf-con---2nc .ABlock}

#### [Epistemology first]{.underline} -- the aff and society is littered with capitalist propaganda

DOA: 7-7-2022, SMarx, JTong\]

Bigger Is Badder: Disinformation Economies of Scale

As if all of this wasn't already bad enough,
**[[capitalists]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[engage in]{.mark}
coordinated [disinformation]{.mark} campaigns]{.underline}**. You likely
already know about some of these: the infamous "tobacco industry
playbook" that protected cigarette revenues for decades against the
threat of cancer lawsuits; the National Football League's history of
muddying the waters on concussions; and, of course, the fact that the
oil industry knew about global warming nearly fifty years ago and chose
to cover it up rather than lose out on profits. But
**[[corporate]{.underline}]{.mark}**-**[[backed disinformation]{.mark}
programs]{.underline}** like these **[[are]{.mark} much more
[common]{.mark}]{.underline}** and much older than you may think.

Instead of admitting that its products poisoned millions of children,
**[the [lead]{.mark} [industry threatened to]{.mark} [sue]{.mark}
television [networks]{.mark} [and ran public relation campaigns blaming
parents]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[The]{.mark} industry-backed
[N]{.mark}ational [R]{.mark}ifle [A]{.mark}ssociation [has been]{.mark}
[pushing]{.mark} pro-gun [propaganda for decades]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Not satisfied with having hidden the reality and severity of climate
change from us for decades, **[the [oil industry
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** now **[[spreading lies about electric
vehicles]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Coca-Cola and Georgia-Pacific have
been known to launder their propaganda throug]{.mark}h flawed
publications in [science]{.mark} [journals]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Sometimes, **[[corporations]{.mark} even [wage these campaigns against
one another]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as in the recent case of Facebook
hiring a right-wing political strategy firm to spread false claims about
TikTok, one of its competitors.

Nor is the problem limited to corporations that want to downplay
specific dangers so as to protect their existing business models. More
and more, [**[falsehoods are the business model.]{.underline}** **[The
capitalist need for deception has become]{.underline}**]{.mark} so
**[[widespread]{.underline}]{.mark}** that there's now an entire
"disinformation-for-hire" industry whose entire purpose is to mislead
and confuse the public. At the same time, traffic-oriented businesses
like Facebook have learned to build themselves around anything that
grabs users' attention, even if those things are misinformation,
manufactured controversies, or lies.

#### [Epistemology Outweighs]{.underline} -- Capitalist media is based around propaganda and lies

**Pickard 21** \[Victor Pickard, professor at the Annenberg School for
Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, 4-22-2021, \"Unseeing
propaganda: How communication scholars learned to love commercial
media,\" Misinformation Review,
https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/unseeing-propaganda-how-communication-scholars-learned-to-love-commercial-media/,
DOA: 7-7-2022, SMarx, JTong\]

**[[Instead of calling out capitalism's corrosive effects on news and
information, many were celebrating]{.mark} the affordances of new
digital technologies and belittling concerns about monopoly
power]{.underline}**. Henry Jenkins (2006), for example, dismissed media
reformers as "critical pessimists" for treating audiences as passive
dupes and relying too much on "melodramatic discourse about
victimization and vulnerability" (pp. 247--248). Over the years, strands
of cultural studies (ironic, given their Marxist roots) joined
positivist social scientists in privileging descriptive over
prescriptive analyses and, at least by implication, dismissing reformist
and normative concerns. **[This long-term marginalization of structural
and critical approaches to communication research made identifying
potential harms and necessary reforms less likely.]{.underline}**

Today, as in the 1940s, **[[communication scholars are scrutinizing
monopolistic firms and their social roles]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Using
terms like dis- and misinformation, we too rarely acknowledge the
unbridled commercialism driving these propaganda machines, from Facebook
to Fox News. There's less evasion now, but we still face a crossroads.
Scholars who study these issues can once again travel the path that
ultimately reaffirms existing power structures---perhaps through some
"social responsibility" arrangement for platforms and media outlets. Or
we can advocate for radically reforming and democratizing information
and communication infrastructures. The choice is ours.

Fortunately, positive signs suggest we're doing better this time. A new
generation of critical scholars, many of whom are women and people of
color, are connecting dis/misinformation and systemic racism to
structural failures such as illegitimate business models, monopoly
power, and capitalism writ large (e.g., Cottom, 2020; Noble, 2018), and
media reform activists are centering critiques of racial capitalism in
their calls for "media reparations" (Free Press, 2020). However, other
analysts are contending there's an overemphasis on such structural
factors, denouncing it as so much social hysteria and moral panic. While
some concerns about overreactions and misdiagnosing problems are
legitimate, they run the risk of reinscribing a limited effects
framework that de-emphasizes harms posed by commercial media
institutions and implicitly pooh-poohs reform efforts.

Of course, misinformation alone doesn't cause social pathologies, but it
helps prolong and exacerbate them, from hardening distrust toward public
institutions to promoting outright fascism. Falsehoods circulating
through media don't always produce dangerous mythologies and behaviors,
but they can legitimate, reinforce, and amplify them. Media serve as
ideological glue for keeping long-standing narratives intact. Studying
political elites and social groups in disinformation campaigns---and
cultural and psychological factors that comprise audiences' affect and
identity---is certainly important. But if we fail to acknowledge the
structural enablers that make malignant communicative behavior possible
in the first place, we doom ourselves to perpetuating it.

**[Ultimately, we should heed earlier critical scholars' insights that
[structural problems require structural reform]{.mark}. Th[ese reforms
should remove or reduce commercial logics incentivizing corporate
behavior that hurts democrac]{.mark}y]{.underline}**. More than simply
placing regulatory patches on broken commercial systems, **[[we must
intervene at media's very foundations]{.underline}]{.mark}** via a
two-pronged strategy of breaking-up and/or aggressively regulating
corporate monopolies while building out non-commercial, democratic
alternatives. This approach recognizes that **[[we]{.mark} [need]{.mark}
not only [a]{.mark} negative [program that aims to snuff out fascistic
propaganda]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} [also]{.mark} a positive program that
[provides robust, diverse, and reliable news and information to all
communities]{.mark}]{.underline}**---and these communities should be
centrally involved in governing and making their own media.

Trustbusting information monopolies always should be on the table, but
we also must address systemic market failures that aren't solvable by
simply enhancing competition between media outlets. In other words**[,
[these aren't just monopoly problems; they're capitalism
problems]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In some cases, we should remove news
and information from the commercial market entirely and treat them as
the public goods they are. For example, it's now abundantly clear
**[that [the market won't support]{.mark} the local [journalism that
democracy requires]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Therefore, we should
bring local news media under public ownership and democratic governance
(Pickard, 2020). Accordingly, we could treat platforms like public
utilities, enforce strong public interest requirements, build out public
media infrastructures, municipalize broadband services, and subsidize
local journalism.

#### The Aff's rejection of the alt is the only reason it fails -- debating about capitalism and its reformation or refusal is good

Booth School of Business, 11-13-2019, \"The Questions That Will Shape

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, **[unless the pendulum of
practicable economics swings in the direction of a different system
entirely, considerable disparities of wealth, an essential condition of
capitalist advancement]{.underline}**, will remain, **[and those who
will continue to occupy the favorable end of this bell curve will be
business professionals]{.underline}**. They will be rich in a time when
the instrumental role of riches will be suspect and the respectability
of great wealth doubtful. They will not be able to justify to others,
and perhaps even to juries of conscience, that material success is a
moral justification unto itself, that simply by doing the best for
themselves, they have already done the best they might do for others.
Unlike for those who preceded them, this ideological assumption, so
tempting and convenient, will no longer be available to them. Great
wealth will not be its own justification. **[[It will need to be
vindicated]{.mark} by the power it confers]{.underline}**.

**[[Such an undertaking calls for a reengagement with debates]{.mark}
over the responsibilities of citizenship, one that involves visiting
anew questions of liberty, justice, equality, wealth, power, and
tradition. [It]{.mark} also [requires a willingness to use
power,]{.mark} in both the private and public spheres]{.underline}**,
less as a club to clear the way for commercial activity than as an
implement of some higher aim, undertaken in a spirit of great
responsibility and obligation.

**[[Such an approach is hardly foreign to the]{.mark} business
[community]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Indeed, such aspirations were a
common language for the commercial elect in the decades after World War
II, and they still fill the charters of public companies, professional
associations, and major business schools alike.
**[[If]{.underline}]{.mark}**, today**[, [they seem the stuff of
boilerplate]{.mark}, a few scattered phrases that are little more than
an empty nod to etiquette, [that's more a reflection of our own civic
disengagement]{.mark} than the dead letter of misbegotten
ambition.]{.underline}**

#### We drive the societal change - we just need to challenge the system

So **[how do]{.underline}**es Gramsci say **[we can escape hegemonic
rule]{.underline}**? As a political economist he of course refers to
structural problems within the production processes. Resource
constraints or too high levels of inequality might challenge their
smooth continuation and therefore the acceptance of the division of
labor and revenues within them. But, most relevant for this book, he
also suggests **[the weakening of the cultural and ideational consensus
or dominant paradigm that helps to justify the unequal distribution
patterns and provide moral hazard on a sociocultural]{.underline}**
rather than structural **[level]{.underline}**.

**[Public discourse after the financial crisis]{.underline}**, at least
in Germany, **[was full of statements]{.underline}**---for example,
**[that human nature is simply greedy]{.underline}** and that it was not
the fault of individual bankers but of regulatory loopholes that they
basically had to use. **[The question these articles never answer is
which of these implacably greedy humans should then suddenly be
enlightened enough to write laws without loopholes. Nor do these
articles suggest how it might be possible to find laws without loopholes
for globalized systems.]{.underline}** The moral hazard discussion so
far points out that systems too big to fail and contracts with golden
parachutes are not very conducive to good governance.

But **[[there is]{.mark} also [a]{.mark} sociocultural moral [hazard
perpetuated by a narrative]{.mark}]{.underline}** and proclaimed common
sense **[[in which people are innately greedy]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[[The ethical default changes from]{.mark} one of '[intending no harm'
to]{.mark} one of '[do everything that is not explicitly forbidden
because this is legitimate]{.mark}]{.underline}**.' Even regulatory and
judicial consequences will differ from those of a society in which
egoistical behavior to the detriment of the great majority is considered
an individual and civilizational failure. Different sentences for
corruption or rape in different cultural settings are just one example
of this hazard effect.

German philosopher Richard David Precht offers a forthright view on the
effects of the widespread adoption of mainstream economic ideas and the
commodification of human relationships: "Strict and tough calculation of
utility, **[[ruthlessness and greed are not man's main driving forces,
but the result of]{.mark} targeted breeding]{.underline}**. One could
call this process '**[the origin of egoism by [capitalist
selection']{.mark}]{.underline}**, following Charles Darwin's famous
principal work" (ibid., here cited by Habermann 2012: 15).

More subtly, Gill writes: "**[a change in thinking is a change in the
social totality and thus has an impact on other social processes; a
change in the social totality will provoke change in the process of
thought]{.underline}**. Hence the process of thinking is part of a
ceaseless dialectic of social being" (Gill 2003: 22). This means that
many of **[[the ultimate drivers of societal change are located within
each one of us]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Here, as indicated in purple and
blue arrows in Fig. 2.6, we find the connection between the big picture
of meta-level paradigms and hegemonic narratives on the meso-level and
the mini-level of individual thinking and acting: **[[everyone can
challenge the]{.mark} declared [system]{.mark}-purpose]{.underline}**

As an opening to this group authored chapter, a review of [McLaren's
(2005) ten characteristics of a revolutionary or Marxian critical
pedagogy]{.underline} is helpful for the purposes of distinction from
typical implementation. [[First, critical pedagogy is reflective]{.mark}
and does [not]{.mark} present itself as [eternal, always existing, or
disconnected]{.mark} from history. It rejects religious and idealistic
notions of a permanent or natural human condition or 'human nature.'
[Second,]{.mark} [critical pedagogy meets]{.mark} the [local needs of
people]{.mark} and considers the importance of social context [while not
walling off people into]{.mark} local or [isolated groups]{.mark}, as is
often done with postmodern identity politics. [Third, critical
pedagogy]{.mark}, while emphasizing the importance of the scientific
method, [is careful to not conflate biological with cultural and
political practices]{.mark} that only serve to reinforce inequality in
the name of objective rationalism. It therefore [rejects]{.mark} notions
of inherent differences between racial groups, ethnocentrism, and other
[ways]{.mark} that [science has 'dressed up' oppressive practices.
Fourth, critical pedagogy attacks]{.mark} the notion of [normative
intelligence "and the ways in which 'reason' has been differently
distributed so that it always advantages the capitalist class"]{.mark}
(p.94). This makes practices such as standardized testing open to
question. [Fifth, critical pedagogy accounts for the move from
industrial capitalism to its current, neoliberal global form.]{.mark}
This creates challenges in communicating how the working class is still
the working class even if the outward appearance of labour has changed.
[Sixth, rather than presenting itself as multicultural, critical
pedagogy goes further and is openly anti-homophobic, anti-sexist, and
anti-racist. Seventh, critical pedagogy]{.mark} not only addresses
questions of meeting human needs, but [seeks to ensure human survival in
the face of environmental destruction, even if this means challenging
capital. Eighth and ninth, critical pedagogy does not seek to work
within the existing capitalist system, but openly advocates socialist
democratic solutions in terms of distribution of existing
resources.]{.mark} It rejects locating the source of global poverty in
overpopulation and other racist memes and instead asserts that
capitalism itself needs to move to the next economic and social phase of
meeting all human needs, not just the needs of a few. [Finally, critical
pedagogy places its alliances with the oppressed, and isn't particularly
interested in giving the oppressor 'equal time.']{.mark}]{.underline}
Standpoint epistemology (Wallace & Wolf, 2005), which not only respects
but privileges the experiences of the working class, can be an essential
component of communicating the tenets of critical pedagogy in a Marxian
manner. [[This does not mean that all working class viewpoints are
emancipatory, but]{.mark} it does mean that [for a dialectical critical
pedagogy]{.mark} the **[burden of proof of oppression is no longer on
the oppressed]{.mark}**, who have historically had to work overtime in
order to demonstrate that their grievances have merit. [Instead, the
oppressor should be compelled to demonstrate that oppression does NOT
exist.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### A critical pedagogy centered around Marxist values and grounded in revolutionary love is vital

**McLaren 10** (Peter, Canadian scholar who serves as Distinguished
Professor in Critical Studies, Attallah College of Educational Studies,
Chapman University, where he is Co-Director of the Paulo Freire
Democratic Project and International Ambassador for Global Ethics and
Social Justice, "Revolutionary Critical Pedagogy" ,
"<https://digitalcommons.chapman.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1127&context=education_articles>,
Accessed 7/7/22", ML)

A pedagogy of critique is aimed at freedom from necessity. [Teresa
Ebert]{.underline} (2009) [writes that a [pedagogy of critique]{.mark}
is a [materialist critique whose purpose is not]{.mark} simply
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} perform an immanent
[[examin]{.underline}]{.mark}ation of the [[cognitive validity of
categories and]{.mark} forms of [knowledge]{.mark} (by locating
contradictions in the rules and systems necessary to]{.underline} the
[production]{.underline} of those forms) [[but to relate these
categories to the outside, material conditions of their
possibility.]{.mark} The [role of materialist critique is to begin
with]{.mark}]{.underline} an immanent investigation of [[a system or a
practice]{.mark} in its own terms [and]{.mark} to [relate
these]{.mark}]{.underline} inside terms [[to their outside historical
and social conditions.]{.mark} [Materialism]{.mark}, as I am using the
term, [consists of]{.mark} the [objective productive activities of
humans that involve them in social relations under definite historical
conditions that are independent of their will and are shaped by struggle
between contesting classes over the surplus produced by social
labor.]{.mark}]{.underline} Derrida argues that critique has no ground
because there is no outside, only the economy of signification, the
inside and outside of language effects---outcomes of representations.
The very language, for instance, with which we articulate or describe
totalizations deconstructs those totalizations, according to Derrida.
[However, the [more important question is not one of norm, truth, or
totalization]{.mark}--- part of all discourses and practices---[but how
they further or resist the interest of a particular class.]{.mark} On
which side of history do you struggle? [Marx maintains]{.mark} that the
[question of whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking
is]{.mark} not a question of theory but [a **practical
question**]{.mark}---hence, [we must prove]{.mark} the truth of our own
thinking [in practice]{.mark}. [A pedagogy of critique is a mode of
social knowing that inquires into **what is not said**, into the
silences and the suppressed or the missing, in order to
un-conceal]{.mark} operations of [economic and political power
underlying]{.mark} the concrete [details and representations of our
lives. It reveals how the abstract logic of the exploitation of the
division of labor informs all]{.mark} the [practices of]{.mark} culture
and [society.]{.mark} Materialist critique disrupts that which
represents itself as natural and thus as inevitable and explains how it
is materially produced. [Critique]{.mark}, in other words, [enables us
to explain how social differences]{.mark}---gender, race, sexuality, and
class---[have been systematically produced and continue to
operate]{.mark} within regimes of exploitation -- namely [within]{.mark}
the [international division of labor in global capitalism, so that we
can fight to change them]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ebert & Zavarzadeh,
2008). Thus, a [[pedagogy of critique is about]{.mark} the [production
of transformative knowledges.]{.mark} It is [not about liberty as the
freedom of desire, because this]{.mark} liberty, this freedom of desire,
[is acquired at the expense of the poverty of others]{.mark}. A pedagogy
of critique, as Ebert (2009) points out, does not situate itself in the
space of]{.underline} the self, or in the space of [desire]{.underline},
or in the space of liberation, [but in the site of collectivity, need,
and emancipation. A [pedagogy of critique is grounded not in desire, but
revolutionary love]{.mark}]{.underline}, that is,
[[recognizing]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[love can only exist between
free and equal people who have the same ideals and commitment to serving
the poor and the oppressed]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is [this moral
affinity]{.underline} that [constitutes]{.underline} the conditions of
[possibility of love. A pedagogy of desire works against the creation of
revolutionary love by celebrating the unknowable, the endless deferral
of meaning and the impossibility of certainty]{.underline} (Ebert &
Zavarzadeh, 2008). The [[principle of uncertainty is one of the key
framing mechanisms of capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} and the expansion
of the market. [[It is about creating new ways to access cheap labor by
disturbing social conditions under capital's relentless
expansion]{.mark}. In all sites of everyday life under capitalist social
relations we have institutional power relations which are not free
spaces that foster equality. Thus[, we need a pedagogy of critique
grounded in revolutionary love in the struggle for transforming these
social relations.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Rejection of Capitalism and the education of the self is a pre-requisite - We must wake up from the eternal loop of capitalism we are in before we are to find solutions

**[If we [step back from]{.mark}]{.underline}** our
**[[political]{.underline}]{.mark}** situation **[we can
[observe]{.mark}]{.underline}** a revolving historical event: **[As long
as our economy is based on capitalist principles]{.underline}**, the
best we can hope for is to place some constraints on the byproducts of
capitalism. Capitalists resist the constraints by paying shills to
confuse us and legislators to roll them back. **[Think [Sisyph\[u\]s
pushing the bolder uphill]{.mark}, [only to watch it roll back
down...forever]{.mark}. [Until we reject capitalism we will be stuck in
this back and forth]{.mark} of which constraints will be left in
place.]{.underline}**

For example, drug companies want to get authorization to make drugs as
quickly as possible, pay for advertising to convince you why you need
them and then sell them for as much as possible. Left to their own
devices, they have sold drugs that kill, harm or do not do what they
claim, overcharge customers, pay their executives exorbitant wages, pay
our legislators to look the other way, etc. Slowly we catch on and force
our legislators to constrain them through law. Then, as now, those
legislators, acting in the interests of drug companies, reach a critical
mass and roll back the laws. Of course, they don't admit to what they
are doing. They spend their time concocting fantasies about why the
rollback was good for their constituents.

This scenario can be applied to just about any aspect of our society.
**[Capitalists will fight constraints]{.underline}**.

How to combat capitalists? You can reason with them, boycott their
products, write articles, educate consumers, but to what end? Just
witness what we're seeing now for your answer.

Another approach is to opt out from supporting capitalism. **[There are
[alternative approaches]{.mark}, but you [need]{.mark} to educate
[you]{.mark}rself and change your perspective]{.underline}**. It**['s
not scary [to]{.mark} envision another approach. [Educate yourself
about]{.mark}]{.underline}** employee-owned
**[[cooperatives]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a variety of sharing
**[[economies]{.mark} and]{.underline}** yes,
**[[socialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Most people under 30 have no issue
with this. Most of us, when presented with the appropriate questions,
have no problem with this. So, **[instead of complaining]{.underline}**
about capitalist byproducts, **[[find a different way, a different
perspective]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It's not all that hard.

#### We must analyze policy and political leaders with an anti-capitalist lens in order to diagnose the capitalist disease within american society-Trump proves

Joshua **Inwood 18**\[Joshua Inwood, Director of Penn State Lab for
Analysis of Culture and Environment (PLACE), \"White supremacy, white

The **[[psychological wage underscores how whites receive a material
beneﬁt for their white identity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Roediger further
argues that the pleasures of whiteness "**[[could be used to make up for
alienating and exploitative class relationships]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
that were and are a hallmark of capital-ism (1991: 12). This insight
connects to a longer history in the United States in which different
ethnic groups could enter into whiteness **[to secure social and civil
beneﬁts]{.underline}**(Ignatiev, 1995: 3). According to Du Bois, this
**[[presents myriad opportunities for]{.underline}]{.mark}** white
politicians and **[[capitalists to exploit white working fears of the
loss of their position by the erosion of]{.underline}]{.mark}** whites'
**[privileged position within the US]{.underline}** racial
**[hierarchy]{.underline}**. Thus, Breitbart's messaging reﬂect nativist
and white supremacist discourses, and they are meant to drive those
fears among white working-class identity. Du Bois explains that the
"doctrine of inferiority" of racism was driven "**[primarily because of
economic motives]{.underline}**" and this devel-opment was
"**[disastrous for modern civilization in science and religion in art
and gov-ernment"]{.underline}** because it proffered that the "colored
peoples of the world were so far inferior to the whites that the white
world had the right to rule mankind for their own selﬁsh interests"
(1935: 39). Therefore when a Breitbart article describes a Democratic
political rally in California quoting: "'Welcome to Oaxacafornia,' said
a Oaxacan woman, referring to the impoverished region of Mexico from
which many immigrants come" (Nazarian,2016), they tap into the most base
and destructive forces in the US, reinforcing narratives of white
superiority and black and brown inferiority. While much of the focus has
been on former Breitbart editor Steve Bannon, Du Bois' insight reveals
that the Trump campaign's engagement with white supremacist politics has
a much more profound association. Accordingly, it is **[[imperative that
we not view Trump as a peculiarity]{.underline}]{.mark}**; instead**[,
[he is part of a broader context in]{.mark} which white supremacist
practices suture to American politics]{.underline}**. The rise of Trump
embodies a 400-year racialized legacy of white supremacy **[and [the
workings]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[of]{.underline}**]{.mark} racialized
**[[capital.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This is the embodiment of the role
white counterrevolutionary politics play in the United States. The
**[[economic history of the United States is built through covert and
overt appeals to]{.mark}]{.underline}** white
**[[solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[soothes over class
divisions and forestalls broader critiques of the US-based capitalist
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The reality is that Trump routinely
played on the fears of white working class voters during the campaign.
In one of the most infamous appeals made to throngs of fans at his
rallies citation/date, Trump declared that this was going to be the last
election when (white)voters would genuinely be able to decide the
outcome because so many minority groups were coming across to the United
States that it would not be possible to elect the next President should
Clinton win. His message was calculated to drive home the fears of
whites who were worried about the demographic transitions occurring in
the United States as well as the threats to their marginalized economic
position. Through his public declarations and his openly racist message,
Trump has **[expanded the global danger of race to a range of groups
that are deemed to pose a challenge to the nation.]{.underline}**14

Conclusion and significance Writing in 1967 at the height of the white
backlash towards civil rights and a short year away from his own
assassination, Martin Luther King, Jr., stated the "value in pulling
racism out of its obscurity and stripping it of its rationalizations
lies in the conﬁdence that it can be changed" (King, 1967: 83). He went
on to argue that if we are ever going to take on racism in all of its
brutality **[[it is necessary to diagnose the
"disease]{.underline}]{.mark}** of racism accurately" and that the US
was going to have to embark on a crusade of redemption that would entail
a "humble acknowledgment of guilt and an honest knowledge of self"
(King,1967: 83). The rise of Donald Trump and his ability engage some of
the darkest currents of the US racial state call into question how far
we have come from the status King outlined in1967. **[[To see Trump as
an anomaly or an outsider]{.underline}]{.mark}** who ran an improbable
campaign---as many mainstream political commentators would have us
believe---**[[is a mistaken diagnosis]{.underline}]{.mark}** and only
obscures the central role white-counter revolutionary politics play in
the US polit-ical economy. Throughout the development of the United
States' political economy, white-ness has stalled modest progressive and
even radical change; as Du Bois worked through in Black Reconstruction,
whiteness is central to understanding the workings of US-style
cap-italism. Robinson (1983: 194) writes that when entering a period of
extended crisis, "the ruling classes" in the United States turn to
"legal and illegal violence, election corrup-tion, and a renewed
emphasis on white supremacy" as the antidote to economic ills. To give
an accurate diagnosis on Trump's election, **[we should focus
on]{.underline}** the long history of white resentment and fear over a
demographic collapse. **[[The changes to the political economy wrought
through neoliberalism should be at the center of efforts to
understanding Trump' selection, and the unwavering backing from white
supporters.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### **Adopting a framework of Emancipatory social science is necessary in order to diagnose the disease of capitalism**

Erik **Olin 19**\[Erik Olin, Erik Olin Wright, an analytical Marxist
sociologist at the University of Wisconsin--Madison, specializing in
social stratification and in egalitarian alternative futures to

**[[Emancipatory social science]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in its broadest
terms, **[[seeks to generate knowledge relevant to the collective
project of challenging human oppression]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
**[creating the conditions in which people can live flourishing
lives]{.underline}**. To call it a social science, rather than social
criticism or philosophy, is to recognize the importance for this task of
systematic scientific knowledge about how the world works.\[2\] **[To
call it emancipatory is to identify its central moral
purpose]{.underline}**---the elimination of oppression, and the creation
of conditions for human flourishing. And to call it social implies a
belief that emancipation **[depends upon the transformation of the
social world, not just the inner self.]{.underline}** To fulfil its
mission, any emancipatory social science faces **[[three basic
tasks]{.underline}]{.mark}**: **[first, [to elaborate]{.mark} a
systematic [diagnosis and critique]{.mark} of [the world]{.mark} as it
exists; second, to envision viable alternatives; and third, [to
understand the obstacles, possibilities and dilemmas of
transformation.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In different historical moments
one or another of these may be more pressing than others, but all are
necessary for a comprehensive emancipatory theory.

Diagnosis and critique

The **[[starting point]{.underline}]{.mark}** for an emancipatory social
science **[[is not simply to show that there is suffering and
inequality]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the world,
**[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[to demonstrate that the explanation
for these ills lies in the specific properties of existing institutions
and social structures]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and **[to identify the
ways in which they systematically cause harm to people]{.underline}**.
The **[[first task]{.underline}]{.mark}**, therefore, **[[is the
diagnosis and critique of the causal processes that generate these
harms.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

This is often the most systematic and developed aspect of emancipatory
social science. In the case of feminism, for example, a great deal of
writing centres on diagnosis of the ways in which existing social
relations and institutions generate various forms of women's oppression.
The focal point of such research is to show that gender inequalities are
not the result of 'nature', but are the product of social processes.
Studies of labour markets have emphasized such things as sex-segregation
of work, evaluation systems which denigrate culturally defined feminine
traits, discrimination in promotion, institutional arrangements that put
working mothers at a disadvantage. Feminist studies of culture have
demonstrated the ways in which a wide range of practices in the media,
education, literature and so on have traditionally reinforced gender
identities and stereotypes. Feminist analyses of the state have examined
the ways in which state structures and policies have systematically
entrenched the subordination of women and various forms of gender
inequality. **[A similar set of observations could be made about
empirical research inspired by labour-movement
traditions]{.underline}**, by theories of racial oppression and by
radical environmentalism.

**[Diagnosis and critique are closely connected to questions of social
justice and normative theory.]{.underline}** To describe a social
arrangement as generating 'harms' is to infuse the analysis with a moral
judgement. Behind every emancipatory theory, there is thus an implicit
theory of justice: a conception of what conditions would have to be met
before the institutions of a society could be deemed just. A full
exploration of the normative theory that underlies the critique of
capitalism is beyond the scope of this paper; but put briefly, the
analysis which follows is animated by what may be called a radical
democratic egalitarian understanding of justice. **[[This rests on two
broad normative claims, one concerning the conditions for social
justice, the other those for political justice:]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Social justice: in a just society, all people would have broadly equal
access to the necessary material and social means to live flourishing
lives.

Political justice: in a politically just society, people should be
equally empowered to contribute to the collective control of the
conditions and decisions which affect their common fate---a principle of
both political equality and collective democratic empowerment.

Taken together, these **[two claims call for a society that deepens the
quality of democracy and enlarges its scope of action, under conditions
of radical social and material equality.]{.underline}** The problem, of
course, is to show how these principles could be put into practice.

Developing alternatives

The **[second task of emancipatory social science]{.underline}** is
**[[to develop a coherent, credible theory of alternatives to existing
institutions and social structures that would eliminate, or at least
significantly reduce, the harms they generate]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Such alternatives can be elaborated and evaluated
**[[by]{.underline}]{.mark}** three different criteria:
**[[desirability, viability and achievability.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
These are nested in a kind of hierarchy: not all desirable alternatives
are viable, and not all viable alternatives are achievable.

The exploration of **[[desirable alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
without the constraints of viability or achievability**[, is the [domain
of utopian social the]{.mark}ory and much normative political
philosophy]{.underline}**. Typically such discussions are
institutionally very thin, the emphasis being on the enunciation of
abstract principles rather than actual institutional designs. Thus, for
example, **[the Marxist]{.underline}** aphorism **[[describing
communism]{.mark}]{.underline}** as a classless society governed by the
principle 'to each according to his need, from each according to his
ability' is almost silent on the institutional arrangements which would
make this principle operative. Liberal theories of justice similarly
elaborate the principles that should be embodied in the institutions of
a just society without systematically exploring whether sustainable,
robust structures could actually be designed to carry out those
principles in the pure form in which they are expressed. \[3\] Though
**[[discussions of this kind may contribute much to clarifying our
values and strengthening our moral commitment to the business of social
change,]{.underline}]{.mark}** they do little to inform the practical
task of institution-building, or add credibility to challenges to
existing institutions.

The study of viable alternatives, by contrast, asks of proposals for
transforming existing social structures whether, if implemented, they
would actually generate in a sustained manner the emancipatory
consequences that motivated their proposal. Perhaps the best known
example of this is central planning, the classic form used to implement
socialist principles. In lieu of the anarchy of the market, socialists
believed that the people's lot would be improved by a rationally planned
economy, implemented through the institutional design of a centralized
comprehensive plan. But the 'perverse', **[unintended consequences of
central planning subverted its intended goals, with the result that few
people today believe it to be a viable emancipatory alternative to
capitalism.]{.underline}**

**[The viability of a specific institutional design]{.underline}**, of
course, **[may not be an all-or-nothing affair.]{.underline}** It may
crucially depend upon various kinds of side conditions. For example, a
generous unconditional basic income may be viable in a country in which
there is a strong, culturally rooted work ethic and sense of collective
obligation, but not in a highly atomistic consumerist society. Or, a
basic income could be viable in a society that had already developed
over a long period of time a generous redistributive welfare state based
on a patchwork of targeted programmes, but not in a society with a
miserly, limited welfare state. **[[Discussions of viability, therefore,
tend also to include the contextual conditions of possibility for
particular designs to work well.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The exploration of **[[viable alternatives brackets the question of
their practical achievability under existing social
conditions.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Some have questioned **[[the value of
discussing theoretically viable alternatives if they are not
strategically achievable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The response to such
sceptics would be that **[[there are so many uncertainties and
contingencies about what lies ahead that we cannot possibly know now
what the limits of achievable alternatives will be in
future.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Given this uncertainty, there are two
reasons why it is important to have clear-headed understandings of the
range of viable alternatives. First, **[[developing such understandings
now makes it more likely that]{.underline}]{.mark}**, if future
conditions expand the boundaries of what is possible, **[[social forces
committed to emancipatory change will be in a position to formulate
practical strategies for implementing an
alternative]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Second, the actual limits of what is
achievable depend in part on beliefs about what sorts of alternatives
are viable. This is **[[a crucial sociological
point]{.underline}]{.mark}**: social limits of possibility are not
independent of beliefs about limits. When a physicist argues that there
is a limit to the maximum speed at which a thing can travel, this is
meant as an objective, untransgressable constraint, operating
independently of our beliefs about speed. In the social case, however,
beliefs about limits systematically affect what is possible. Developing
compelling accounts of viable alternatives, therefore, is one component
of the process through which these limits can themselves be changed.

It is no easy matter to make a credible argument that 'another world is
possible'. People are born into societies that are always already made,
whose rules they learn and internalize as they grow up. **[[People are
preoccupied with the daily tasks of making a living, and coping with
life's pains and pleasures.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The idea that the
social world could be deliberately changed for the better in some
fundamental way strikes them as far-fetched---both because it is hard to
envisage some dramatically better yet workable alternative, and because
it is hard to imagine successfully challenging the structures of power
and privilege in order to create it. Thus even if one accepts the
diagnosis and critique of existing institutions, **[the most natural
response is probably a fatalistic sense that not much could be done to
really change things.]{.underline}**

Such fatalism poses a serious problem for those committed to redressing
the injustices of the existing social world. One strategy, of course, is
**[[simply not to worry too much about having scientifically credible
scenarios for radical social change, but to try instead to create an
inspiring vision of a desirable alternative, grounded in anger at the
inequities of the world in which we live and infused with hope and
passion about human possibilities.]{.underline}]{.mark}** At times, such
charismatic wishful thinking has **[[been a powerful mobilizing
force.]{.underline}]{.mark}** But it is unlikely to form an adequate
basis for transforming the world so as to produce a sustainable
emancipatory alternative. History is filled with heroic victories over
existing structures of oppression, followed by the tragic construction
of new forms of domination and inequality. The second task of
emancipatory social science, therefore, is **[[to develop in as
systematic a way as possible a scientifically grounded conception of
viable alternative institutions.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Developing **[[coherent theories of]{.mark} achievable
[alternatives]{.mark}]{.underline}** is central to the practical work of
strategies for social change. This is a difficult undertaking, not only
because assessments of what is achievable are vulnerable to wishful
thinking, but also because the future conditions which will affect the
prospects of any long-term strategy are highly contingent. As in the
case of viability, moreover, achievability does not pose a simple
dichotomy: different projects of institutional transformation have
different prospects for ever being implemented. The probability that any
given viable alternative could at some future date be put into practice
depends upon two kinds of process. First, upon the consciously pursued
strategies and relative power of the social actors who support or oppose
the alternative in question. Second, upon the trajectory over time of a
wide range of social structural conditions which affect these
strategies' chances of success. This trajectory is itself partially the
product of the cumulative unintended effects of human action, but it is
also the result of the conscious strategies of actors to transform the
conditions of their own actions. The achievability of an alternative
thus depends upon the extent to which coherent, compelling strategies
can be formulated which both help to create the conditions for
implementing alternatives in the future, and have the potential to
mobilize the necessary social forces to support that alternative when
such conditions occur.

A theory of transformation

Developing an understanding of these issues is the objective of the
third general task of emancipatory social science: the theory of
transformation. **[[We can think of emancipatory social science as an
account of a journey from the present to a possible
future:]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[the critique of society tells us why
we want to leave the world in which we live; the theory of alternatives
tells us where we want to go; and the theory of transformation tells us
how to get from here to there.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This involves a
number of difficult, interconnected problems: a theory of the mechanisms
of social reproduction which sustain existing structures of power and
privilege; a theory of the contradictions, limits and gaps in such
systems, which can open up space for strategies of social
transformation; a theory of the developmental dynamics of the system
that will change the conditions for such strategies over time; and,
crucially, a theory of the strategies of transformation themselves. I
will return to the problem of transformative strategies in the
concluding section of this paper. **[[Our central concern in what
follows, however, will be the second of the three core tasks identified
above: the problem of elaborating viable emancipatory alternatives to
capitalism.]{.underline}]{.mark}** To set the stage for this discussion,
it may be helpful first to **[[sketch the basic elements of a critique
of capitalism, laying out the harms that are caused by capitalist
processes and which animate the search for an
alternative.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

education, and arguably in this country.

**[In the latter half of the nineteenth century, trade and
communications on a global scale had developed in strong connection with
the emergence of a globe-spanning submarine telegraph
network.]{.underline}** By 1903 roughly 406,000 kilometers of submarine
cables crossed the world's oceans. **[The highly important [North
Atlantic connection]{.mark} alone processed about 10,000 messages daily;
the companies operating the twelve Atlantic cables represented a total
estimated capital of £17 million, [making them some of the most
lucrative contemporary multinationals]{.mark}]{.underline}**.2 This
article disentangles why Angell, along with other economists, government
officials, submarine cable entrepreneurs, and colonial subjects, **[came
to see [global capitalism and communications as so intertwined that they
no longer bothered to explain why the two fitted together.]{.mark}
Similarly, to today's scholars, they postulated the intricate connection
between intercontinental telegraphic communication and world commerce
without explaining the specifics of this link or its consequences for
the structuration of the modern world]{.underline}**.3 **[Analyzing the
structures, ideas, and mechanisms underlying the mutual interaction
between [communications and capitalism opens up new perspectives]{.mark}
on the political, economic, and social geographies of the modern
world.]{.underline}** The **[historian Norma Aventine has argued that
the [global submarine cable network facilitated the very existence of
'world commerce' and 'world politics']{.mark},]{.underline}** but did
not examine how this occurred.4 Other scholars have investigated how
capitalism affected the specific market of communications companies.5
This article incorporates the business history of communications
companies into global history to build upon and move beyond the mere
idea that world communication enabled globalization processes of
commerce, finance, and trade. Scholars have tended to examine the
connections between communications and politics (as well as between
communications and the military) far more than those between
communications and commerce or, more specifically, the emergence of
global industrial capitalism.6 Some economic historians have focused on
the telegraph's influence on the London and New York stock markets and
have developed models to 'calculate' that influence, but few have
written on understandings of the market and communications
infrastructures.7 Others have investigated the political economy of
Anglo-American communications or the economics of the cable business,
but have paid less attention to contexts beyond the communications
market or the interrelation between imperialism and the expansion of the
world economy.8 Economists, too, have recently started to explore the
media as a business and as a key influence in politics, though they have
focused on the United States.**[9 This article uses the example of
submarine telegraphy to substantiate how histories of communications and
capitalism fit together and reciprocally influence each other in three
important ways. First,]{.underline}** **[the business history of
communications companies would benefit from incorporating broader
context beyond the firms, the analysis of the communications market as
such, or the interrelation of communications and empire.]{.underline}**
As historians have shown for the Anglo-American sphere, the development
of **[communications networks depended upon decisions made within firms
about capital investments, profits, and potentially lucrative
markets]{.underline}**.**[10 This article further uncovers how cable
entrepreneurs created the [global telegraph network based upon
particular understandings of cross-border trade following the logic of
economic liberalism, profit maximization, and natural monopoly
theory,]{.mark} while economists such as John Maynard Keynes and John
Hobson saw global communications as the foundation for capitalist
exchange based on telegraphic speed and the dematerialization of
information]{.underline}**. During the nineteenth century, new
communications technologies **[radically altered contemporaries'
experiences of time and space, which in turn fundamentally reconfigured
business and investment strategies, structures, and
decisions]{.underline}**.11 For the communications market, these
contemporary views on the interconnections between communication and
commerce resulted in a duopoly of primarily government-owned landlines
**[and primarily privately owned submarine lines. This created two
distinct political economies of communications, both interlocking with
the emergence of global industrial capitalism.]{.underline}**12 In
business conduct, telegraphic communication eliminated the middleman and
promoted business transactions based on speed, such as futures
trading.13 The business history perspective on the private and
multinational business of submarine telegraphy in particular shows how
new (and faster) forms of economic interaction -- as well as new forms
of managing and financing commercial interactions -- emerged.14
**[Second, the history of communications is also an economic history of
the agents that structured and territorialized the modern world by
creating myriad (market) identity spaces. [Telegraphy enabled capitalist
exchange, and understandings of telegraphy supported the development of
particular global capitalist systems]{.mark}. This exchange not only
consolidated existing markets, such as the transatlantic Euro-American
trade, [but later created new markets, such as the Pan-American and
Pacific markets. Economists, too, saw global communications networks as
the foundation for understanding the political organization of world
trade]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The 'metaphorical constitution' of the
national economy enabled contemporaries to develop the notion of a
national economic unity as a tangible object.15 German and Austrian
economists extended that metaphor to the world economy.**[16 The
business history of communications companies enables us to rethink the
spaces of capitalism and how those spaces emerged. Finally, [the
relationship between communications and capitalism reconfigured social
interaction.]{.mark} The initial cable system seemed to cover the world,
but it [often followed imperial economic logic]{.mark}. [Networks
operated along pre-existing colonial trading and shipping lines, leaving
many places 'untouched' by telegraphy]{.mark}]{.underline}**.**[17
Simultaneously, contemporary understandings of capitalism affected where
cables were laid and who could use them. The geography of global
telegraphy therefore created particular understandings of the 'world'
that [excluded significant portions of its population]{.mark}. The
article examines how the interaction between telegraphy and capitalism
reinforced social orders that [excluded most of the world's population
based on concepts of race, gender, and class from participation in
global communication]{.mark}. Telegraphy affected many more people than
its actual users, while also spurring protests from around the globe
about its perceived Western and capitalist hegemony.]{.underline}**
**[Depending upon their points of view, protagonists from across the
world saw economic and communications networks as overlapping,
coterminous, or mutually antagonistic.]{.underline}** Figures primarily
from non-Western contexts, such **[as [Gandhi, viewed capitalism and
communications as so intertwined that they simultaneously sought
alternatives to both]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Taken together, these
three aspects reveal how communications and commerce together mapped the
modern world, carving out non-congruent spaces of political, economic,
and social interaction. Overall]{.underline}**, the article argues for
**[a new chronology to understand the development of communications. In
the 1860s, national developments made land telegraphy a concern of the
state within European nations, while global submarine telegraphy became
a [private enterprise dominated by the theory of natural monopoly and
intended to buttress existing trade]{.mark} routes. Global telegraphic
networks were constructed to support extant capitalist systems until the
1890s. Submarine cable companies followed imperial logic only as far as
it was profitable and solidified pre-existing commercial connections
through telegraphy]{.underline}**. In the **[1890s, however, states and
corporations began to lay submarine cables either to open up new
markets, particularly in Asia and Latin America, or to use telegraphs
for military, imperial, or strategic control]{.underline}**. Changes to
global communications (both wired and wireless) spawned ideas of
developing new markets and using cables and wireless not just to
reinforce existing networks of trade but also to support state
geopolitical ambitions and exploit new markets. These reconfigurations
only occurred within the political economy of global communications, not
national networks**[. [Ultimately, the success of global telegraph
networks laid the groundwork for a system of intertwined communications
and capitalism that has lasted until today.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### [Security links]{.underline} -- valuing security only furthers capitalist society

**Rigakos 16** \[George S. Rigakos, 2016,
[Security/Capital]{.underline}, Introduction: Security under Capitalism,
Edinburgh University Press, SMarx, JTong\]

Over the last four decades a number of powerful social and eco nomic
trends have begun to significantly impact both class politics and how we
may theorize it. These socioeconomic trends have been exacerbated even
further in the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2008--9, resulting in
the re-mobilization of a wide array of popular movements crystallizing
with Occupy and Syriza. **[[Bourgeois insecurity has become more
acute]{.mark} as evidenced by rising inequality]{.underline}** 1
marching in lockstep with climbing public and private policing
employment since at least the 1970s. 2 **[[Increased inequality has also
coincided with greater rates of exploitation]{.mark};]{.underline}** 3
**[[significant decreases in union membership]{.underline}]{.mark}**; 4
**[[and the intensification of the everyday economic insecurity of
workers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially part-time and precarious
workers, 5 **[who have taken on more and more debt]{.underline}** 6
**[in order to maintain a standard of living comparable to previous
generations]{.underline}**. Emerging into popular consciousness at this
time has also been the economic and social insularity of the 1 per cent
7 -- an awareness that has produced a renewal of critique aimed at
addressing how, in the wake of the Great Recession, there has been no
clear political alternative to the retrenchment of neoliberalism through
austerity and further global economic uncertainty.[8 **[This generalized
insecurity has taken place alongside the rhetorical rise of the "war on
terror" layered over the top of an already existing "war on drugs" and a
"war on crime"]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[with their concomitant race,
class, and gender implications]{.underline}**. 9 **[[War making as a
form of peace-making or "war as peace]{.mark}"]{.underline}** 10 [**[has
become an essential facilitator for the proliferation of a
security]{.underline}**-- **[industrial complex
inextricably]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[bound up with capital
accumulation]{.underline}]{.mark}** 11 and Empire.12 Mass demonstrations
against the ceremonial gathering of corporate and state elites during
meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) or the Group of Twenty (G20) have cast in
stark relief the politics of the 99 per cent with that of the 1 per
cent; have drawn visible, geographic boundaries 13 around the
permissibility of dissent; 14 and have facilitated the occupation and
colonization of urban space for the purpose of "extending the scope of
productive labour" 15 and the circuit of capital accumulation.16 These
processes, of course, have a very long history 17 tied to the formation
of "police science" and the functional connection between wealth
accumulation and the fabrication of a social order. 18 Police science
gave rise to a form of prudential thinking and planning that
foreshadowed an increasingly elaborate system of risk management and
threat assessment. 19 **[[Police]{.mark} [science]{.mark} thus comprises
the strategic field of bourgeois planning aimed at making populations
"productive" through the enforcement of a wage-labor
system]{.underline}**. **[It [supports]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in short,
**[[the only war contemporary politics dares not recognize but that has
served as the foundation for all projects of pacification: class war.
Marx long ago warned about the embedded nature of "security" with its
associated projects of bourgeois social ordering]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
In On the Jewish Question (first published in 1844) he wrote:
"**[[security]{.mark} [is the supreme concept of bourgeois society. The
concept of police]{.mark}]{.underline}**." 20 His words are particularly
prophetic today in light of how deeply entrenched and entangled US
corporate interests are with police power and surveillance. 21 The
National Security Agency (NSA) leaks22 highlighted the reach of Empire
and increasingly how tactics aimed at jihadist terrorists have been
extended to domestic dissidents. 23 Of course, snooping on both domestic
and foreign dissidents is certainly not new 24 but the colonization by
risk 25 and security logics of almost all facets of social and political
discourse 26 has significant ideological and material consequences.
Radical scholars have certainly taken note of these developments but are
also the first to point out that none of these trends is inherently new
or necessarily a post-9/ 11 development. They argue instead that "the
security apparatus that revved up in the days after the attack had been
in the making for decades" 27 and should best be understood as part of
the long duree28 of the logic of capitalism through pacification.29 To
that end, analyses of pacification have included considerations of
privacy; 30 the response to 'Black Bloc' tactics and anarchist social
movements;31 the relentless surveillance and policing of the poor, 32
precarious migrant workers, 33 and welfare recipients; 34 the
infiltration and cooption of aboriginal resistance; 35 the increasing
control of pro tests as a form of insurgency;36 and even the military
mobilization against resistance through air power 37 to name but a few.
38 A prevalent theme that binds these recent analyses 39 is their recur
ring reference to the materialist basis of pacification 40 and the study
of how "productive labor" is imagined and achieved by political
economists, police intellectuals, and colonial planners who are, more
often than not, one in the same.

technology.]{.underline}** Increasingly, **[[U.S. military agencies are

a variety of contracting mechanisms like other transaction authority as
well as pilot and pathfinder programs aimed at testing new technologies
and system architectures]{.underline}**. **[U.S. Air Force Space

Space Command [took over
responsibility](https://spacenews.com/air-force-space-command-officially-takes-over-as-chief-buyer-of-satellite-communications-for-the-defense-department/) in
December for procuring the Defense Department's commercial satellite
communications services from the Defense Information Systems
Agency]{.underline}**. "We have a number of initiatives that our office
has put in effect with more to come," said Mike Nichols, chief of
commercial satellite communications for Air Force Space Command's
Satellite Solutions Branch. Gen. John Raymond, who leads Air Force Space
Command, "told us get after it: enterprise architecture, real-time
provisioning, real-time situational awareness**[," Nichols said.
However, [the Defense Department faces cultural challenges when it tries
to quickly adopt commercial technology]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark}
said Ken Peterman, Viasat Government Systems president. Private sector
innovation in space, cybersecurity and mobile networking are prompting
changes in acquisition policy, practice and culture, Peterman said. "An
acquisition system predicated on invention has to turn into one that can
assess, adopt, apply and then evolve more effectively than ever before,"
he added. As an example, Peterman points to Apollo program. "When we put
a man on the moon, there were probably 10,000 NASA contracts to invent
everything from aluminum foil to Tang, the breakfast drink," Peterman
said**[. "If [NASA wanted to put a man or woman on Mars toda]{.mark}y,
the fastest, [most effective way to do that, might be to write a one or
two-page statement of objectives and let Elon Musk, \[Jeff\] Bezos,
Richard Branson and some others bid on
that.]{.mark}]{.underline}**["]{.mark} If government agencies don't
embrace commercial innovation, the consequences could be grave,
according to a panel of experts discussing the implications of space as
a warfare domain**[. "[The U.S. government's ability to maintain
dominance in space will be heavily dependent]{.mark} [on]{.mark} their
ability to work quickly to take advantage of all the [commercial
innovation]{.mark} we're talking about here]{.underline}**," said Chris
DeMay, HawkEye 360 chief technology officer and co-founder. "We see
enemy nations investing in their own companies with parallel
capabilities that will exceed ours if the U.S. government can't continue
to invest at a faster rate." Rajeev Gopal, advanced programs vice
president for Hughes Network Systems' Defense and Intelligence Systems
Division**[, suggested government agencies gain access to commercial
innovation with brief documents describing their needs instead of
publishing 100 pages of requirements. He also suggested the government
award fixed price contracts.]{.underline}** "Give the high-level
requirements and let commercial solutions emerge," Gopal told SpaceNews.
"With fixed price contracts, there is some risk but there is also
flexibility to innovate." Hughes has found that flexibility in its work
applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve
interoperability and network management, Lober said. In July, **[[Hughes
won an \$11.8 million contract to help the U.S. Army improve satellite
communications resiliency and interoperability]{.mark}. Specifically,
Hughes plans to apply machine learning and artificial intelligence to
improve network management, automated control and interoperability of
narrowband satellite communications architectures for the Army's Combat
Capabilities Development Command Space and Terrestrial Communications
Directorate]{.underline}**. When networks are built for
interoperability, "service can be ported from one satellite to another
and from one beam to another," Gopal said. **["If one asset is
compromised you have to others to take its place. That is happening
today with automation, modular architecture and machine
learning]{.underline}**."

Western Aggression

[[In reality, NATO]{.mark} was founded in 1949 [not as]{.mark} an
[instrument of peace]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} **[as a weapon]{.mark}** to
fight the Cold War. **It has remained a weapon ever
since.**]{.underline}

**[[It is a military alliance]{.mark},]{.underline}** which gets
three-quarters of its funding from the USA; and which says that if one
member is attacked, then every other member must respond with force.

[[After]{.mark} the [collapse of the Soviet Union]{.mark}, the
**[Russian economy]{.mark} entered [free fall]{.mark}. [Chaos
reigned,]{.mark} and** [Russia]{.mark} was [on its knees]{.mark}. The
**[western imperialists seized the opportunity to expand their

has been [a key part of this strategy]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In 1999, [former Warsaw Pact countries Poland, Hungary, and the Czech
Republic joined NATO]{.underline}. In 2004, they were [joined by
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania]{.underline}. [Slowly but surely,
Russia's borders were being ringed by members of a hostile military
alliance.]{.underline}

[NATO's provocations towards Russia continued. In 2003, a rabidly pro-US
government was brought to power in Georgia. US advisers helped train the
Georgian army, and encouraged them to test the limits of
Russia]{.underline}'s defensive capability.

At a 2008 summit in Bucharest, [NATO members agreed that Georgia and
Ukraine, both bordering Russia, would join the alliance in the

a world scale has drastically [changed the contex]{.mark}t. [The US has
a historically high]{.mark} sovereign [debt, a social crisis and rising
class polarisation]{.mark} all of which has led to a deep political
crisis]{.underline}**. This limits its ability to intervene on a world
scale as it used to in the past. But Europe is no better off. The
European Union is cracking and the British Brexit vote has set in motion
a chain of crises which had been prepared over the last period.

The Italian banking crisis is only one of these, but it is huge and it
is in turn affecting the German financial system which is at the heart
of European capitalism. All of these are in turn feeding back into the
global crisis. This summit demonstrated that the power of NATO is
suffering from the same crisis which is affecting all levels of society.

In spite of attempts to act as if nothing has happened, The Guardian
reports of a different mood behind the scenes:

"However, a Nato official said the issue was driving anxious
conversations behind the scenes ahead of the summit.

"'How can it not affect western cohesion? How can trillions being wiped
out in market value not affect perceptions of western strength?'"

Another commentator, Krzysztof Blusz, said:

"Regardless \[of\] how and when Brexit happens, it will create a
situation where Nato member states are more inward looking, more
preoccupied with their nationalist tendencies. The impulse is already
there, but this will add to the distraction and the Kremlin will not
miss the chance to use the situation for its advantage."

As well as pitting national capitalist classes against each other, the
economic crisis has also paved the way for a rise in class struggle and
through that political turmoil in the west. The political stability
which was based on the post-war economic boom is at an end. In one
European country after another, the established parties of the ruling
class are losing legitimacy and new left and right-wing parties are
gaining influence. The attitude towards foreign interventions is
extremely critical and parties are increasingly reluctant to risk their
political future on imperialist adventures with little chance of
success.

Of course **[[NATO is still an important tool of the west]{.mark}ern
ruling classes used [to subjugate and exploit nations]{.mark} throughout
the world]{.underline}**. But it is clear that the conditions which
brought NATO into being no longer exist. In fact as a recent article in
the New York Times put it, "it is hard to imagine that Europe and the
United States would, if they had the chance in 2016, write another
Article 5 at all."

The result is a **[NATO entering into a period of crisis erupting from
the contradiction between the present underlying objective situation and
the treaty of a past period]{.underline}**. The most intelligent
bourgeois see this and are worried about the repercussions of major
incident on the cohesiveness of NATO:

\"It's easy to imagine how the scenario would play out: Poland and the
Baltic countries would call for a strong response to pre-empt another
annexation like that of Crimea. The Germans and French would call for
negotiations with Moscow, doubting that Article 5 would be invoked. The
Greeks, Italians and Spanish would make clear that their economies had
already suffered enough from the sanctions on Russia after the
annexation of Crimea. And much of the public across Europe, manipulated
by Russian propaganda, would ask if the Russians weren't somehow right
in trying to support their fellows in the Baltic States. Wasn't it
actually the imperial United States who set all this up, some would
argue, just like Washington's agents were behind the coup in Kiev?\"
Does NATO Still Exist?

In this context Russia could play a larger role on a global scale by
exploiting the crisis of western imperialism. **[[Western European
ruling classes are wary of provoking Russia]{.mark} to meddle in EU
affairs and the eastern European ones fear Russia intervening in their
countries politically and militarily. This fear in itself will be enough
to strengthen Russia's influence in the region.]{.underline}**

**[[The crisis and decline of western imperialism the most reactionary
force on the planet is a part of the general crisis of
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the next period this will increase
instability and tension between the nations, but it will also be an
impulse for more intense class struggle. **[[The only alternative to the
barbarism spread in the wake of imperialism]{.mark} [is an
international]{.mark} revolutionary [working class
movement]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[As the contradictions come to the
fore and the narrow minded corrupt nature of the ruling classes are
exposed, the basis for building such a movement will also
grow.]{.underline}**

#### Turns case -- Russian aggression is only due to the threat of Western and NATO imperialism

SMarx, JTong\]

NATO\'s promise of continued support for Ukraine in the face of
Russia\'s \"cruelty\" has brought an angry response from Vladimir
**[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}**, who **[[denounced the alliance\'s
\"imperialist ambitions]{.underline}]{.mark}**\".

At their summit in Madrid, members of the Western military alliance
pledged to back Ukraine for as long as necessary, modernising the
country\'s army to help it resist Russia's invasion. NATO also updated
its strategic plan to name Russia as the biggest \"direct threat\" to
Western security.

The alliance has also approved membership applications from Finland and
Sweden and announced a massive boost in troop numbers along its eastern
flank.

But speaking during a visit to Turkmenistan, **[the Russian president
blasted the West\'s attitude. \"[The leading countries of NATO]{.mark}
[want]{.mark}]{.underline}** (\...) **[[to assert]{.mark} their
[hegemony]{.mark}, their imperial [ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\"
he said.

\"**[The call for Ukraine to continue fighting and refuse negotiations
only confirms]{.underline}** our assumption **[[that Ukraine]{.mark} and
the good of the Ukrainian people [is not the goal of the West and
NATO]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} a means to defend [their own
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" the Russian leader added.

### NATO Link Ext. Cards

#### NATO is responsible for the current Russian-Ukrainian War -- Continued support for NATO and silencing of critics will create endless Russian War

**MARCETIC '22** \-- a Jacobin staff writer and the author of
Yesterday\'s Man: The Case Against Joe Biden(BRANKO , "The Orwellian
Attacks on Critics of NATO Policy Must Stop",
https://jacobin.com/2022/03/russia-ukraine-war-invasion-nato-expansion-criticism

There's Jack Matlock, who served as US ambassador to the Soviet Union
under Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush after a decades-long career as
one of the top Soviet experts in the US Foreign Service. He wrote in the
lead-up to this war that "**[[there would have been no]{.mark} basis for
the [present crisis if there had been no expansion of the
alliance]{.mark} following the end of the Cold War]{.underline}**," and
that "**[the policies pursued by]{.underline}** Presidents George W**[.
Bush]{.underline}**, Barack **[Obama,]{.underline}** Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** Joe **[Biden have all
contributed to bringing us to this point.]{.underline}**" Matlock had
called for a diplomatic solution to prevent war, principally around
Moscow's negotiation demands to draw a hard line on NATO's expansion,
saying that "what Putin is demanding is eminently reasonable." Stephen
**[[Walt, Harvard professor]{.underline}]{.mark}** of international
relations and columnist for Foreign Policy, **[made a similar
argument]{.underline}**, puzzling over the fact that while Western
countries ruled out fighting on Ukraine's behalf, "**[the US negotiating
position (and thus NATO's position as a whole) hasn't budged at all on
the central issue dividing the two sides]{.underline}**" --- **[meaning,
Ukraine's status in NATO]{.underline}**. He lamented the
"black-and-white view of the situation in Ukraine" that holds that
"Russia's stated grievances have no legitimate basis whatsoever; and the
only conceivable Western response is to refuse to make any concessions."
**[Walt's fellow "realist" thinker]{.underline}** John **[Mearsheimer
has been making this case for years]{.underline}**, **[chiding [Western
officials]{.mark} for continually [trying to bring Ukraine into their
orbit]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[lead]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[ing
[Russia to take drastic, illegal steps to counteract
it]{.mark}]{.underline}**. He recently told the New Yorker he believed
"**[all the trouble in this case really started in]{.underline}** April
20**[08]{.underline}**," **[when Bush made his infamous announcement on
Ukraine and Georgia, despite Moscow making it clear "they viewed this as
an existential threat, and they drew a line in the sand]{.underline}**."
Mearsheimer dismissed the idea Putin is bent on conquering a broader
swath of Europe to restore the Russian Empire or Soviet Union as an
argument "invented" by "the foreign-policy establishment in the United
States, and in the West more generally," and believes Kiev can come to
some kind of "modus vivendi" with Moscow. Samuel Charap, a Ukraine
expert at the RAND Corporation (a Pentagon-aligned think tank originally
started by the air force), argued that what had been in early February
just **[[the Ukraine "crisis" was "a symptom of \[Washington's\] runaway
success]{.mark}" after the Cold War]{.underline}**. He charged that
**["[Russia is destined to clash again with the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[and
its allies over the status of these former Soviet republics unless all
parties can agree on a mutually acceptable arrangement for the regional
order]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Or see **[international relations
prof]{.underline}**essor Rajan **[Menon]{.underline}** and former George
W. Bush national security staffer Thomas Graham, who **[urged US
officials in]{.underline}** Politico back in **[January to stave off war
by "accommodating some of Russia's principal security
concerns]{.underline}**," and formalizing "a declared moratorium on the
accession of Ukraine, or any other former Soviet state" into NATO for as
long as twenty-five years. See the recent comments by the critical
Russian sociologist Greg Yudin, who was recently arrested and brutalized
at an antiwar protest in Moscow, and who warned just a day before the
invasion began that "**[[NATO]{.mark} is certainly a potential military
adversary of Russia," that it "is not a peaceful and innocent
alliance]{.underline}**," and that **[its [expansion is "an unfriendly
action towards Russia" that "any responsible Russian government should
seek to prevent]{.mark}]{.underline}**." The Ukrainian sociologist
Volodymyr Ishchenko has warned that it was becoming "increasingly clear
that **[[a Putin successor, however progressive or democratic they may
be, would still see Ukraine's NATO membership as a
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**," and that among the solutions to the then
building crisis was, among other things, "restoring Ukraine's
non-alignment status" and reversing the 2019 amendment that enshrined
the goal of "Euro-Atlantic integration" into the country's constitution.
You could go on and on: Katrina vanden Heuvel writing that ["**[NATO now
largely exists to manage the risks created by its
existence]{.underline}**]{.mark}" in the Washington Post; Jeffrey Sachs
urging Washington to "compromise on NATO to save Ukraine" in the
Financial Times; or Kings College Ukraine expert Anatol Lieven, who has
stressed that same history and repeatedly called for solutions like a
neutral Ukraine and a moratorium on its entry into the alliance, first
to stave off this war and now to end it. In fact, when Lieven convened a
collection of former US and British ambassadors and experts in January
this year, their consensus was that "the Russian government has not yet
decided on war," and that Washington would "have to go much further"
than its initial responses to Moscow's first negotiation bid. That's not
even getting into the many, many US establishment figures who warned
throughout the decades that NATO expansion would eventually provoke the
very thing it was meant to be guarding against. First among them is
George Kennan, widely regarded as the father of the Cold War containment
policy, who presciently warned in 1997 that expanding NATO eastward
would "inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic
tendencies in Russian opinion," "have an adverse effect on the
development of Russian democracy," and "impel Russian foreign policy in
directions decidedly not to our liking." Or the eighteen former
diplomats who warned the policy risked "significantly exacerbating the
instability that now exists in the zone that lies between Germany and
Russia, and convincing most Russians that the United States and the West
are attempting to isolate, encircle, and subordinate them." Or the fifty
prominent foreign-policy experts, including retired military officers,
diplomats, and former senators, who signed on to a letter calling
**[[NATO expansion]{.mark} "a policy error of historic proportions" that
was "opposed across the entire political spectrum," and [would
"strengthen the nondemocratic opposition, undercut those who favor
reform and cooperation with the West, \[and\] bring the Russians to
question the entire post-Cold War settlement]{.mark}]{.underline}**." Or
Biden's current CIA director, William Burns, who wrote from Moscow in
1995 that "hostility to early NATO expansion is almost universally felt
across the domestic political spectrum here," and that the move was
"premature at best, and needlessly provocative at worst." Thirteen years
later, Burns would inform the Bush administration that "Ukrainian entry
into NATO is the brightest of all redlines for the Russian elite (not
just Putin)," and that "in more than two and a half years of
conversations with key Russian players," he had "yet to find anyone who
views Ukraine in NATO as anything other than a direct challenge to
Russian interests." Just two years ago, Burns wrote of how "Russians
stewed in their grievance and sense of disadvantage" and how "a
gathering storm of 'stab in the back' theories slowly swirled." Or the
US intelligence agencies, which, according to former intelligence
analyst Fiona Hill (now a Russia expert at the Brookings Institution),
all opposed the idea of offering membership to Ukraine and Georgia in
2008, only for Bush to override them --- now viewed by most foreign
policy experts as a key turning point in US-Russian relations after the
Cold War and Putin's own relationship with Washington. Or the numerous
other establishment voices, from Tom Friedman and Henry Kissinger to
Zbigniew Brzezinski and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who all made similar
criticisms of the policy at the time. **[[In the fervor of war, we
are]{.mark} suddenly being [told to believe all of these are]{.mark}
merely the foolish and [traitorous apologetics of Putin]{.mark}
sycophants and fringe extremists]{.underline}**, invented just now to
vindicate Moscow's invasion and even strengthen Russia. **[[The speed
with which these ideas have]{.mark},]{.underline}** in the West,
**[[gone from conventional]{.mark} mainstream opinion [to treasonous
lies and propaganda has been shocking to witness.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Explaining War Is Not Justifying It Why is all this important? **[We
have to know how we got to this point, what policy choices we in the
West had control over contributed to it, and what we could have done
different]{.underline}**ly. **[By doing so, [we can not only avoid
repeating the same mistakes and watching a terrible history replay again
and again, but find some political, nonmilitary way out of what's
happening now]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[and secure a lasting stability
for Ukraine and Europe, if not long-term
peace]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** The idea now widely
advanced that Putin is an Adolph Hitler--like madman bent on world
domination, and that Western policy over the past decades played no
meaningful role in the choice he made to launch this atrocious and
illegal invasion, is a very convenient one. It's a convenient one for
those Western officials who played leading roles in that policy,
including the sitting US president, who led the very first effort to
expand NATO. **[[It's convenient for arms manufacturers and every other
corporate leech feeding off endless global
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It's convenient for the war hawks who
would cynically use this war to justify breathtakingly dangerous ideas
like turning Ukraine into an Afghanistan-like permanent warzone. And, of
course, it rules out any diplomatic settlement to end this terrible
crime, because a madman who wants to take over the world cannot be
negotiated with. Just as important, if we don't understand how Western
policy helped lead to this conflict and we don't work to veer away from
similar mistakes in the future, conflict and war is forever inevitable.
As the figures listed above pointed out, opposition in Russia to NATO's
expansion goes well beyond the single figure of Putin. If and when he
eventually leaves power, and Western policymakers continue to plow ahead
with the policy --- having been persuaded by the political and media
figures now assuring us that NATO has nothing to do with what's going on
and all this is merely the product of one man's megalomania --- we will
likely find that the leadership that replaces him is no less opposed,
creating the conditions for a permanent state of conflict. Maybe you
disagree with this analysis, or the possible solutions to end this war.
You have every right to do so. But **[to delegitimize them with smears
and character assassinations]{.underline}**, even cast them as
borderline criminal, **[is outrageous]{.underline}** and shocking
**[behavior that risks repeating some of the most shameful episodes of
history]{.underline}**, such as the disastrous post-9/11 war frenzy, the
McCarthyite witch hunts of the 1950s, and the repression and abuses of
the 1920s Red Scare and World War I. Trying to explain the role of
Western foreign policy in stoking jihadist terrorism doesn't justify or
excuse the atrocity committed on September 11. **[Understanding how the
Treaty of Versailles helped lead to World War II doesn't justify or
excuse Hitler's invasions that triggered that war. Two weeks ago, these
were things that went without saying. Now they're apparently
treasonous]{.underline}**.

#### NATO creates war in the name of democracy and virtue -- Citizens' education is key to holding its leaders accountable and taking down capitalism

**[[There is no force more destructive in]{.mark} human [society than
war]{.mark}.]{.underline}** With every day and every mile it advances,
**[[it tears apart the fabric of life]{.underline}]{.mark}** around it.
**[Schools close, transport stops, the streets empty, and that is the
deep breath before the plunge. When the wave itself arrives[, it
brings]{.mark} with it [fear like few]{.mark} of us who do not live in
war zones [can]{.mark} truly [understand: the sounds of bombs]{.mark},
the images of destruction in places just minutes from your home, then
[the sight of blood and]{.mark} injury [and death]{.mark}. In the end,
that is what [war is: organized killing]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[That is the reality facing]{.mark} millions of people across
[Ukraine today]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is brutal and tragic and
heartbreaking in equal measure. **[[There should be no
equivocation]{.mark} on the Left]{.underline}** **[in
[condemning]{.mark}]{.underline}** Vladimir **[[Putin's invasion]{.mark}
and the murder it brings in its wake]{.underline}**. Context matters
when it comes to conflict, but **[there can be no justification for
sending tanks and planes into a sovereign country. It is a historic
crime]{.underline}**. We must do what we can to support the Ukrainian
refugees who are its victims, and to show our solidarity with the brave
protesters in cities across Russia who insist that it is not carried out
in their name.

Today, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, elected with an overwhelming mandate by the
Ukrainian people in 2019, called on the Putin government to end the
violence and negotiate. Everyone who thinks of themselves as a democrat
should back that call.

**[[It is precisely because war is so devastating]{.mark} that [we need
an antiwar movement]{.mark}. This is especially the case in a world in
which [unipolarity]{.mark}, and the unquestioned dominance of the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, **[[is quickly
unraveling]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The geopolitics of the 2020s,
'30s, and '40s will]{.mark} not look like those of the 1990s or 2000s.
They [will look]{.mark} a lot more [like the twentieth century, with
major powers competing for influence]{.mark} across the globe. If we
want [to avoid the worst]{.mark} episodes [of the last hundred
years]{.mark} from repeating themselves, [we need to learn their
lessons]{.mark} once again --- and swiftly.]{.underline}**

A Mass Movement That Dissents

**[[One lesson is this: we must be able to criticize our own
governments]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The path to war is paved with
the nationalist mythologies of great powers]{.mark} and the impunity of
their leaders]{.underline}**. **[In Russia's case, this has been on
clear display]{.underline}** in recent days, **[with Putin's hour-long
lectures laying out a particularly distorted version of
history]{.underline}**. **[But it isn't only in Russia where great
powers have mythologies and leaders go to war with
impunity.]{.underline}**

In Britain, **[[our leaders have invaded sovereign states without
provocation]{.mark}. They did in [Iraq in]{.mark} 20[03]{.mark}, taking
part in the killing of hundreds of thousands]{.underline}**. **[The
people who lied to take us into that war faced no
consequences]{.underline}**. Their careers continued, as did their
luxurious lives, as an entire region of the world was plunged into the
depths of hell for decades. **[We are still living with its consequences
today]{.underline}**, including here in Britain, whether it be the
refugee crisis or the restriction of civil liberties brought about by
the "war on terror."

But they did not only do it in Iraq. We hear very little today about
Britain's role in **[[the NATO-led war in Libya]{.mark} in
2011]{.underline}**, which demolished that state, **[left its people in
the hands of warlords, and pushed thousands to flee and drown in the
Mediterranean]{.underline}**. Nor do we hear about Britain's
**[complicity in [the ongoing war in Yemen]{.mark}, conducted by our
ally Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** with our weapons, £17.6 billion of
which have been provided by BAE systems to the Saudis since 2015. The
United Nations estimates that **[377,000 Yemenis have died in that
conflict.]{.underline}**

**[[These lives are not any less]{.mark} or any more important
[than]{.mark} the lives of [Ukrainians.]{.mark} [We should fight to end
all of these wars, and all]{.mark} of the wars yet to
[come.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

One thing is for certain: **[[we will not end war by saying]{.mark} that
[our side represents virtue and the other side represents
evi]{.mark}l]{.underline}**. But **[[that is]{.mark} the
[mythology]{.mark} we swallow from our leaders and media]{.underline}**
in the West every single day. Ever since the Cold War, [t**[he West has
framed itself as]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[a [defender of
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}** and freedom of expression across the
globe. Liberal opinion in our home countries has repeated this ad
nauseam. **[[But it was hardly ever true]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[Even in Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, when the Cold War ended and
the West reigned supreme and unchallenged across the face of the earth,
**[[the West]{.mark}]{.underline}** could not and [**[would not stand up
for democracy]{.underline}**. **[It intervened brazenly in the 1996
Russian election to help the fraudsters]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[who
won it for Boris Yeltsin]{.underline}**, **[a result that in many ways
paved the way for the Russia we see today.]{.underline}**

How many people in the West know about their governments' role in that
election? How many know that the mass privatization that followed under
Yeltsin resulted in millions of excess deaths in the former Soviet
Union? This academic study is not from some fringe journals; it was a
2009 finding published in the Lancet. Life expectancy among Russian men
fell from sixty-seven in 1985 to sixty in 2007. That is a social
catastrophe, and we helped to cause it.

Is it any surprise, then, that **[[when the dream of capitalist
democracy we sold the Russian people turned out to be a fraud, they
turned to a nationalist demagogue]{.underline}]{.mark}** like Putin? It
is not, but they didn't do it alone. Britain's intelligence services
helped to facilitate Putin's rise and Tony Blair even flew to St
Petersburg to attend the opera at his side in order to bolster his
credibility. Even more damning, our leaders supported Putin in his
brutal slaughter in Chechnya, ignoring the war crimes he committed in
order to further the interests of British Petroleum.

Challenging the Political Class

This is the same political class that bloviates in Parliament now about
its opposition to Putin, making grandiose statements and rattling
sabers. None of it should provide any solace to the people of Ukraine.
**[For our leaders in the West]{.underline}**, they **[were just as much
a pawn on a geopolitical chessboard as they are for Putin. But
[unless]{.mark}]{.underline}** that reality --- **[[the fact that we do
not represent justice, democracy, or peace]{.mark} on a global scale ---
[dawns on people living here, they will never be held to account for
their actions]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

In 2008, NATO invited Georgia and Ukraine to join its alliance. The
logic for Georgians and Ukrainians, with an overwhelming and
increasingly hostile military power next door, was obvious enough. But
what kind of a game were our leaders playing? Did they ever intend, as
NATO membership requires, to go to war with Russia if it invaded these
countries? Did they ever really see them as important enough? The answer
to that question was clear almost immediately when Russia invaded
Georgia. It is even clearer today.

But onward our leaders pushed regardless, encouraging the Ukrainian
government to continue down a path of military integration with the
West. They sold the Ukrainian people a lie that their democracy and
freedom would be safeguarded with US and British and French military
might. It was never going to be --- and nor should it. Would the world
be a safer place today if nuclear powers faced each other head-on in
Eastern Europe? What would the prognosis be for freedom and democracy
anywhere on earth under those circumstances?

And so, what was all this for? Why were the Ukrainians walked up a
garden path only to be abandoned to their fate? Did anyone really
believe that Russia would permit American missiles to be placed on its
border? They didn't, for the same reason we all know that the United
States would never permit China to place its missiles in Guadalajara. In
fact, we don't need the hypothetical: when the Soviet Union tried it in
Cuba, we got the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis, the
closest the world has ever come to nuclear war.

**[[No War but Class War]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[It is correct to damn]{.underline}** Vladimir **[Putin for his role
in the bloodshed in Ukraine today]{.underline}**. **[It is also
important to account for [our own government]{.mark}s' role in the
crisis --- the point at which we had real leverage and could have
changed the course of history.]{.underline}** The fact is, Britain could
have spent recent decades building a multilateral international order of
cooperation, dialogue, and peace. Instead, **[it [spent its time
fighting and funding wars and pursuing the interests of its corporate
elite]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[The only people who will tell]{.underline}** you **[that
story]{.underline}**, amid the constant self-aggrandizement of the
political and media class, **[are those in the anti-war
movement]{.underline}**. That is why their voices matter. They may not
always get the analysis correct, but **[their perspective is
invaluable]{.underline}**.

And **[it is exactly at moments like this that the establishment tries
to shut them up]{.underline}**, because their own approach to the world
stands so exposed. The hawks scoff at the idea of multilateralism or a
world of genuine dialogue. They see it as naive. They say it could never
contain a leader like Putin.

But what has their bellicose rhetoric achieved? How naive was their
approach to Ukraine and its people? Why is it that these figures, who
actually influence foreign policy in this country, are never held to
account for their failures?

Part of the answer is that they find scapegoats. They line up eleven
Labour left MPs who signed an anti-war statement and offer them up as
examples of national traitors or Putin puppets. They threaten to purge
them. They turn their bellicose rhetoric on the enemy within, people who
they know had absolutely no influence over the decisions that led to
this war in the first place.

And the cycle goes on. Meanwhile, the same government that claims to
support Ukrainians pushes through anti-refugee legislation that will
make the lives of any who flee to Britain a living hell. **[The arms
sales to authoritarian regimes around the world that wage wars of
aggression will continue]{.underline}**. **[[The mythology about the
West's defense of democracy will endure, even as it offers illusions to
peoples it never cared about or intended to
protect.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[At the same time]{.mark}, it has continually [expanded eastwards
towards Russia, surrounding the country]{.mark} with troops and military
equipment]{.underline}.

[Starmer's fairy [stories]{.mark} are [akin to those]{.mark} that we are

Such claptrap is only fit for children, not thinking workers and youth.

Western Aggression

[[In reality, NATO]{.mark} was founded in 1949 [not as]{.mark} an
[instrument of peace]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} **[as a weapon]{.mark}** to
fight the Cold War. **It has remained a weapon ever
since.**]{.underline}

**[[It is a military alliance]{.mark},]{.underline}** which gets
three-quarters of its funding from the USA; and which says that if one
member is attacked, then every other member must respond with force.

[[After]{.mark} the [collapse of the Soviet Union]{.mark}, the
**[Russian economy]{.mark} entered [free fall]{.mark}. [Chaos
reigned,]{.mark} and** [Russia]{.mark} was [on its knees]{.mark}. The
**[western imperialists seized the opportunity to expand their
markets]{.mark}** and spheres of influence eastwards. **[NATO]{.mark}
has been [a key part of this strategy]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In 1999, [former Warsaw Pact countries Poland, Hungary, and the Czech
Republic joined NATO]{.underline}. In 2004, they were [joined by
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania]{.underline}. [Slowly but surely,
Russia's borders were being ringed by members of a hostile military
alliance.]{.underline}

[Starmer describes Russia as "the aggressor" and a "bully." But **which
of [NATO]{.mark} and Russia has [hawkishly expanded]{.mark}
[into]{.mark} the [markets and territories]{.mark} of the other's former
allies**? **Which has been [placing troops and military]{.mark} hardware
[on]{.mark} the [borders]{.mark} of the other for many
years**?]{.underline}

[NATO's provocations towards Russia continued. In 2003, a rabidly pro-US
government was brought to power in Georgia. US advisers helped train the
Georgian army, and encouraged them to test the limits of
Russia]{.underline}'s defensive capability.

At a 2008 summit in Bucharest, [NATO members agreed that Georgia and
Ukraine, both bordering Russia, would join the alliance in the
future.]{.underline}

[Whipped up by these events, Georgian president Saakashvili attacked the
autonomous region of South Ossetia in 2008, where over 90% of the
population are Russian citizens.]{.underline}

#### NATO and its expansion exist for the purpose of benefiting the economic interests of US and [exerting]{.underline} capitalism on the rest of the world

**Tariqi 22** \[Felice, 3-26-2022, \"What is NATO? Why do we call for
its dismantling?,\" IWL-FI,

smarx, HHW\]

[The [origins of NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} (North Atlantic Treaty
Organization) go back to 1948, when the United Kingdom, France, and the
Benelux countries (Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg)
[[formed]{.mark} [a **military alliance**]{.mark} **[out of
fear]{.mark}** of potential German and Soviet aggression after World War
II. By 1949, the founding members began to see this as insufficient.
Soon thereafter, the United States and Canada joined.]{.underline}
Subsequently, the alliance formed three commands: Europe, the Atlantic,
and the English Channel (the last dissolved in 1994). France withdrew
from military participation in 1966, rejoining in 2009.

[When West Germany was admitted in 1955, the USSR responded by forming
the Warsaw Pact, giving the lie to the original [NATO]{.mark} founders'
perception of Soviet aggression.]{.underline} As Marxist geographer
David Harvey explains, "[[Cultivating fear]{.mark} (both fake and real)
of the Soviets and Communism was [instrumental to]{.mark} this (cold
war) [politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. The economic consequence has been
wave after wave of technological and organizational innovation in
military hardware."

[**The [arms industry]{.mark}---a form of [monopoly capitalism]{.mark}**
often referred to as the "military-industrial complex"---has
[always]{.mark} been at [the heart of NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, as it
sought to balance the numerical superiority of the Warsaw Pact's armed
forces with technological superiority, including medium range nuclear
weapons.

Article 5 of the NATO treaty states that an attack on any signatory
would be regarded as an attack on the other members. This "collective
defense" pact was first invoked in 2001 following the Sept. 11 attacks
on the United States. Currently, 30 countries are NATO members, 28 of
which are in Europe (the U.S. and Canada are the two non-European
members). The most recent entrant is North Macedonia, a former Yugoslav
province, admitted in May 2020. NATO's courting of Ukraine---especially
after the Western-supported 2013-2014 "Euromaidan" protests and the 2014
Russian annexation of Crimea---all the while maintaining that it refuses
to directly militarily intervene there, has generated the ambiguity
contributing to the current crisis. It also coincided with the increase
of Ukraine's debt with the IMF and the application of neoliberal
austerity policies.

[[After]{.mark} the [collapse of the USSR]{.mark} in 1991, the Warsaw
Pact was dissolved but **[NATO kept growing]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Since the late 1990s it has expanded to 14 new countries. [This
[military encroachment]{.mark} has been largely [naturalized by
U.S]{.mark}. and European governments [as]{.mark} a guarantee of
[peace]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} its **[root causes]{.mark} have
[not]{.mark} been really [explained]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In the
United States, the likes of The New York Times and PBS have been among
the worst in this regard, constantly drilling audiences with Pentagon
talking points and focusing almost entirely on issues of logistics
rather than the larger geopolitical context.

[Instead, we offer a materialist explanation, specifically
contextualizing [NATO's]{.mark} aims both within U.S. [imperialist
ambitions]{.mark} and within the emergence of rentier capitalism since
the 1990s]{.underline}. To summarize, as many have discussed, the [U.S.
regime rejected a "peace dividend" after the defeat of the USSR. This is
puzzling **[only when]{.mark} we [fail to consider]{.mark} [how]{.mark}
central to [U.S. capitalist profits]{.mark} both the [expansion
of]{.mark} U.S. [military bases]{.mark} since World War II and the
military-industrial complex**]{.underline} [since the 1990s have
been.]{.underline}

At the time of this writing, [[U.S. President]{.mark} Joe Biden is
visiting Europe for an emergency NATO summit, along with meetings of the
G7 and the European Council, in what the bourgeois media is depicting as
an "honor lap"]{.underline} of sorts after the shambolic Trump years.
Read without the fog of bourgeois sentimentality, [European capitalist
politicians are welcoming Washington back as their prodigal king. This
trip occurs in the immediate aftermath of Biden's [pledge]{.mark} to
devote [\$3 billion]{.mark} from the \$13.6 billion [Ukraine
"aid]{.mark}" package to increase U.S. NATO troops in
Europe]{.underline}, and another \$700 million to support Foreign
Military Financing and to foster U.S. counter-espionage activities ISR
(intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance). **[This [move]{.mark}
can only be [seen by]{.mark} the [Russians as]{.mark} an
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[As of July 2021, the [U.S. operates about 750 bases in]{.mark} at least
[80 countries]{.mark} and [spends more on]{.mark} its [military
than]{.mark} the [next 10 countries combined]{.mark}**. Since the
Pentagon publishes incomplete data, the number of bases may be even be
higher.**]{.underline} A significant number of these bases are located
in NATO member countries: Germany (119 bases), Italy (44), the UK (25),
Portugal (21), Turkey (13), and Belgium (11). Moreover, the U.S. deploys
approximately 173,000 troops in 159 countries. Again, NATO member states
host a large proportion, at least 60,000, of these troops, with the
following breakdown: Germany (33,948), Italy (12,247), UK (over 9000),
Spain (over 3000), Turkey (1600+), Belgium (1000+), and Norway (700+).

[Interestingly, one of the agenda points of Biden's summit with the
Europeans will be to discuss NATO's long-term deployment plans. In 1997
the U.S. and Russia signed an agreement in which the U.S. promised not
to deploy troops permanently in frontline states]{.underline}. In 2014,
after Russia annexed Crimea, the U.S. began to exert a military presence
in both Poland and the Baltic states, but "in rotating deployments to
honor the letter of that agreement," as reported by the Guardian.
[However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has voided the deal, in the
eyes of the U.S. and its NATO allies. Now the U.S. is pushing for
permanent basing, which has long been the desire of the Baltic
states.]{.underline}

[The [idea that U.S. bases]{.mark} and troops [intervene]{.mark} in
foreign countries [to provide security]{.mark} and to promote human
rights [is belied]{.mark} by the real history of U.S.
bases]{.underline}, as described in an excellent book, "Bases of
Empire," edited by the anthropologist and director of the Cost of War
Project, Catherine Lutz. As Lutz shows, **[U.S. [bases have many
functions]{.mark}, [none of which promote the security or human rights
of host populations]{.mark}. For example:]{.underline}**

[[Basing comes with]{.mark} Status of Forces Agreements
([SOFAs]{.mark}]{.underline}), not just with NATO countries but anywhere
Uncle Sam goes. [These [grant U.S. soldiers immunity from]{.mark} local
[laws]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Bases expand U.S. military capacity]{.mark} to wage
war]{.underline}---for example, when the U.S. used its bases in Guam,
Thailand, and Philippines during the Vietnam War.

[[Bases provide "R&R]{.mark}" for invading U.S. soldiers,
**[inflicting]{.mark} the [misogyny and racism]{.mark} of many of these
troops on local populations.**]{.underline}

[The CIA used secret bases in Laos to ship heroine to U.S. troops in
Vietnam]{.underline}.

[Bases facilitate the **shipment of U.S. material to its theaters of
invasion and intervention**]{.underline}**.**

[[Bases enable]{.mark} the [U.S. to **manipulate local
governments**]{.mark} **[and]{.mark} to exert influence on them to
[change laws in the interests of U.S. capital.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[Base agreements]{.mark} often [come with]{.mark} **U.S. [investment
and]{.mark} [trade treaties tying countries into U.S. trade relations
and forcing liberalization]{.mark}** [and
privatization]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The [ultimate goal of NATO]{.mark} today is [to secure]{.mark} the
[support of governments]{.mark} allied to the U.S. in the region, offer
so-called "protection" and IMF/WB "financing" in exchange for austerity
policies and privatization, [as well as **pushing forward imperialist
policies abroad which benefit U.S. capital**]{.mark}. It is a [military
alliance to back]{.mark} a concrete [economic]{.mark} and political
[project]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[All of this helps explain [why]{.mark} Biden and [NATO see]{.mark} the
[Russia war]{.mark} on Ukraine as an opportunity [to]{.mark}
[escalate]{.mark} [imperialist intervention]{.mark}. However, it is not
just old school military intervention and basing that is at
play]{.underline}. Since the 1970s**, [[U.S. imperialism]{.mark} has
[morphed into]{.mark} something more indirect yet equally sinister: the
[promotion of]{.mark} rentier [capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}.**

The decline in U.S. manufacturing generated a profitability crisis,
going back to the early 1970s. To revive profitability, U.S. capitalism
shifted toward "rentier" sectors such as the arms industry (aka. The
military-industrial complex or MIC), finance-insurance-real estate
(FIRE), and oil, gas, and mineral extraction (OGM). Rent-seeking
capital, as opposed to surplus-value generating capital---for example,
manufacturing or agriculture---seeks profits through monopolization of
property, whether in the form of resources, financial assets, or
so-called intellectual property. Often, rent-seeking capital is
described as the search for profit without the contribution of social
value (think of the activities of your typical sleazy landlord).

[Rent-seeking [capital]{.mark}, specifically the MIC, FIRE, and OGM
sectors, has [risen to dominance]{.mark} in the United States over the
past generation, and the [promotion of]{.mark} these sectors has been
the raison d'etre both of domestic national politics and of
[NATO]{.mark} in that time]{.underline}. Since 1991, the [alliance has
[primarily served U.S. interests]{.mark}, shifting European and other
U.S. allies' focus from their domestic spheres toward that of U.S.
"national security."]{.underline} As economist Michael Hudson has
explained, **[[NATO]{.mark} has [become]{.mark}, in effect, Europe's
[foreign]{.mark} [policy]{.mark} ministry, [dominating]{.mark} domestic
[economic interests]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Use of NATO promotes capitalism 

**Wojcik**, 20**19** (John, Editor in Chief of People's World. "NATO
gathering this week did nothing for world peace and progress" People's
World. December 4, 2019.
<https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/nato-gathering-this-week-did-nothing-for-world-peace-and-progress/>
///MF)

[This week, the heads of the NATO countries have been meeting in London
to "celebrate" the 70th anniversary of the military alliance. The main
news coverage coming out of the gathering revolves around Trump
demanding that the members up their contributions to the alliance piggy
bank]{.underline}, tales of how leaders of many countries are gossiping
about the behaviors of the American president, and Donald Trump's
description of the Canadian prime minister as "two-faced."

The so-called liberal media, reflected by MSNBC, goes a bit further in
its commentary, but, unfortunately, it too parrots the false description
of NATO as the long-time guarantor of democracy and peace in Europe and
around the world. In the eagerness to lampoon whatever Trump says or
does, the knee-jerk response for some in the media is to support or
praise anything the president might criticize.

[The [North Atlantic Treaty Organization,]{.mark} as an instrument of
U.S. foreign policy for seven decades, has never been the good-guy
guardian of world peace and progress. Instead, it [has been the
instrument by which U.S. and transnational corporations can dominate the
planet through]{.mark} military, [economic,]{.mark} and political
[means.]{.mark}]{.underline}

When the situation called for it---whether in Iraq, Serbia, Croatia,
Libya, Syria, or Afghanistan---NATO could be counted on to step forward
in full support of U.S. foreign policy. Today it plays that role by
planning, under the leadership of the U.S., war games on the borders of
Russia that involve hundreds of thousands of troops and weapons and by
backing up U.S. military operations in the Middle East.

[NATO policy, like most of U.S. foreign policy over the last 70 years,
has resulted not in peace and democracy but in war, massive human
suffering, displacement of millions of refugees, and, not least,
incredible numbers of deaths.]{.underline}

[In addition to being a [military protector of capitalism]{.mark} and
guarantor of its export to formerly socialist Eastern European
countries, NATO is also an international outlaw
organization.]{.underline}

Like the U.S., it has conducted many illegal wars. In violation of its
own constitution, it goes to war without UN authorization and almost
always in cases where there has been no military attack on one of its
members. Essentially every single military exploit undertaken by NATO
has been just as illegal under international law as have been the wars
conducted by the United States since NATO was founded.

[Instead of bringing these truths to Americans, the media was busy this
week talking about the fight between Trump and French President Macron
over France paying its "fair share" into the alliance piggy bank. They
never bothered to touch on where those NATO dues go once they're paid
up.]{.underline}

When the corporate media does talk about the alliance, they usually put
forward false narratives. They say, for example, that NATO was formed in
response to Soviet aggression.

When the alliance was founded in 1949, the Soviet Union had just lost 25
million of its people fighting Hitler and the Nazis. The countries that
founded NATO, with the exception of Germany of course, had been allied
with the Soviet Union in that fight. [What changed by 1949 was that the
[capitalists in control of NATO's founding members were alarmed that in
one European country after another, the left was growing and often
taking political power.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Around the world, former colonies were breaking away from their
masters. NATO was created to foster the unity of the [capitalist Western
countries to enable them to maintain economic and political control of
as much of the world as possible.]{.mark} The need, as far as NATO was
concerned, was to make sure the 20th century would be the century that
saw capitalism triumph over socialism. The truth is that when NATO began
in 1949, there was no threat of aggression coming from the Soviet
Union.]{.underline}

If the reason for starting NATO was to counter Soviet aggression, then
why did NATO not disband after the Soviet Union and the socialist
countries were defeated? [The reason, of course, is that [maintaining
capitalism and imperialist control of the world was always the real
goa]{.mark}l. From the time of the end of the USSR and the socialist
countries in Europe until now, NATO has continued in this role, becoming
capitalism's global military arm.]{.underline}

After the defeat of the socialist countries, Russia was promised by the
U.S. that NATO would not be expanded to include Soviet-allied states.
That pledge was of course ignored. Instead, the alliance expanded from a
dozen to 29 countries, including many on the borders of Russia. And they
haven't stopped, pushing now to grab Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine---all
former republics that made up part of the Soviet Union itself. On top of
that, they are also expanding into Latin America, with their eyes on
Colombia and Brazil.

[Trump bragged this week that he had a good meeting with NATO General
Secretary Jens Stoltenberg. Stoltenberg was happy about Trump's push for
higher NATO spending by member countries, who have now pledged to hike
the NATO coffers by some \$400 billion.]{.underline}

It should frighten us that where the people rise up for economic
justice, like in Venezuela and Bolivia, for example, the progressive
forces have to be ready for the U.S. and NATO to pounce. [It is no
accident that NATO is putting the moves on countries that surround
Venezuela and Bolivia, countries that have rejected U.S. imperialism.
Free elections, democracy, and human rights are not the criteria for
NATO action. [The alliance acts whenever and wherever the interests of
imperialism or capitalism are threatened.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Yet today, we unfortunately see liberal lawmakers who join in support
for NATO even though the defense of that alliance and support for the
U.S. military budget threatens world peace and the funding for
progressive programs here at home. Even the best in the U.S. Congress,
among them Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, voted for the NATO
Support Act earlier this year.

We know that for some the vote was a tactical one---they figure it will
pass anyway so why go out on a limb? At some point, however, the line
must be drawn and the truth must be told. NATO is a dangerous and
international military strike force for capitalism. U.S. generals
operating under NATO cover at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany are
sitting on top of nuclear missiles that they say protect against
"aggression from the East."

The direction we have to move in is one that creates a new international
order involving bodies that use diplomacy rather than war to resolve
disputes. This might involve strengthening the UN or perhaps creating
new bodies with the power to prosecute any country that violates human
rights or tries to foment war. Unlike NATO's focus on military action,
there has to be a focus on ending the threat of war, particularly
nuclear war.

NATO has done nothing to make the world safer in this or any other way.
Instead, it poses a clear and present danger to humanity.

 

#### NATO expansion is based in capitalist ideals

madness of capitalism" green left. May 6, 2022.

In an astonishing speech delivered in London on April 27, British
foreign secretary [Liz
Truss](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-mansion-house-speech-at-the-lord-mayors-easter-banquet-the-return-of-geopolitics) called
for the "globalisation" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
to pre-empt "threats in the Indo-Pacific", namely China. Truss's speech,
entitled "The return of geopolitics" promoted a stronger NATO in
response to the war in Ukraine, but reserved much of its venom for
China.

membership'](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/most-significant-consequence-finland-has-been-question-nato-membership)

It is almost a year since Britain sent its new aircraft carrier,
the [HMS Queen Elizabeth](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3143308/british-navy-shows-global-ambitions-aircraft-carriers-south#:~:text=HMS%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20and%20its%20strike%20group%20are%20in%20the,the%20end%20of%20the%20year.) for
military drills in the South China Sea --- the first such mission since
the beginning of the Korean War. Truss visited Australia in January to
further sound the drums of war, with totally unfounded denunciations of
China's intentions in the region.

Britain's previous imperial exchanges with China include running opium
into the country, launching the opium wars, and the seizure of Hong
Kong. Given this history, Truss's most recent outburst hardly endeared
her to the Chinese.

[Truss said the [globalisation of NATO is a necessary step]{.mark}.
China, the South China Sea, and the entire region is, according to her
logic, within the sphere of influence and responsibility of
NATO.]{.underline}

[But the concept of globalising NATO is absurd. NATO is constituted as a
regional military alliance concerned with the North Atlantic. Thus,
China does not easily fit into NATO's purported mission to protect
Europe from security threats.]{.underline}

The hypocrisy of the Foreign Secretary when it comes to relations with
China is unacceptable. Truss envisions "a world where free nations are
assertive and in the ascendant. Where freedom and democracy are
strengthened through a network of economic and security partnerships.
Where aggressors are contained and forced to take a better path". These
few lines outline an entire world view that threatens us all.

First, there is the appeal for free nations to become increasingly
"assertive". Freedom, in this logic comes at the point of a bayonet.
China has been routinely criticised over the past decade for being too
assertive. But China's \"assertiveness\" has often been in response to
aggressive actions by successive United States administrations, with the
loyal support of Australia.

[Truss claims that [economic and security agreements strengthen
democracy and freedom]{.mark}. China and [the Solomon
Islands](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/solomon-islands-elections-and-preparing-war) have
just entered into a security agreement which might well include economic
benefits, [but this is being used as proof of China's aggressive
intent.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[China's economic rise is a fact. It is something that the US is
fighting, and the British ruling class seems to think it a fight that
can be won.]{.underline} Truss argues that "by talking about the rise of
China as inevitable we are doing China's work for it. In fact, their
rise isn't inevitable. They will not continue to rise if they don't play
by the rules\". Some might see that as a direct threat.

The British anti-China campaign insists China observes certain rules.
But these imperialist rules have nothing to do with observing democratic
values. [[Instead, imperialism demands that China must not seek economic
power, and must not influence others]{.mark}. Such imperialism [cannot
be simply
dismissed](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/24/former-australian-pm-paul-keating-criticises-liz-truss-over-demented-china-comments):
the actions of Britain are part of a broader movement that is gaining
momentum and is becoming more strident.]{.underline}

Britain's overt militarism in the region is often portrayed as a
response to Chinese assertiveness and imagined aggression. But behind
this an overarching agenda of struggle for control of the world economy.

The influential [Australian Strategic Policy
Institute](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/australia-should-make-its-own-long-range-missiles/) is
urging that Australia should begin to produce long-range missiles. The
only possible target for such missiles would be China.

Australia, Britain and the US have pledged to expand their cooperation
in the development and deployment of [hypersonic
weapons](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/05/aukus-pact-extended-to-development-of-hypersonic-weapons) as
part of the AUKUS security arrangement.

China has responded to this heightened threat by decrying what it
describes as an "[Asia-Pacific version of
NATO](https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/post/max-opray/2022/04/07/china-rages-against-asia-pacific-nato)".
China's concerns are understandable and such provocative actions serve
to make the region more insecure. [[These actions, along with the calls
for a globalised NATO will only generate more fear and
distrust.]{.underline}]{.mark}

This is a dangerous state of play. Threats are inevitably met by counter
threats. Arms build-ups are met with arms build-ups. War preparations
continue, and billions upon billions of dollars are spent on preparing
for a war that is in no-one's best interests. There will be huge
ramifications for working people everywhere.

[The [global economy is fragile and growth is
slowing](https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2022/05/03/its-not-looking-good-for-2022/).
In the first quarter of 2022 the US economy shrunk by 0.4%, Germany's
rose by just 0.2% and China's by 1.3%. Other economies have yet to
release data, but the trend is clear. The International Monetary Fund
forecasts total global growth for the next two years to be in the range
of 2%. While all economies are slowing, China's remains relatively
healthy with annual growth predictions of about 5%.]{.underline}

[If [China]{.mark} does not play by the \"rules\" as determined by the
US, Britain and Australia, then [its economic growth must be curtailed,
or so runs the imperialist narrative. If this is the case then the
capitalist global economy is set for contraction, recession and
depression, as it is largely due to the continued relative health of the
Chinese economy that global capitalism is still keeping its head above
water. These realities, it would seem, are secondary to the desire to
stop China's economic growth.]{.mark}]{.underline}

There is madness in this approach. [The upholders of the rules-based
order are prepared to fight tooth and claw to preserve capitalism, not
democracy. They are prepared to do anything to maintain US domination. A
confrontation with China is a fight against a capitalist rival. China
does not threaten capitalism, but it does pose a real risk that US
economic power will be lost.]{.underline}

The world has never been more insecure. [[Global capitalist growth is
crumbling]{.underline}]{.mark}. The climate crisis is an existential
threat. War rages in Europe, and the US and its allies are turning their
attention to a potentially devastating conflict with China.

Truss is but the latest of a long line of warmongers who threaten the
peace and stability of us all. She is not alone. She speaks on behalf of
the nations of AUKUS --- a cog in the wheel of a globalising NATO.

cheating (Pevehouse, Russet 2006, p.969-1000). Furthermore,
international organisations ensure states comply with rules and
regulations of the international system, reduce transaction cost of
exchange, and socialize states to cooperate with each other at
international level (Ruggie, 1992). Thus, the US pursued such an
approach in the immediate aftermath of the Cold war. **[[Various Eastern
European states integrated into the NATO]{.mark} and European Union. And
this wave of NATO and EU expansion from Central Europe to the Eastern
Europe continued without interruption]{.underline}** (Mearsheimer,
2011). However, finally, these expansions stopped when Russian President
Putin drew red lines over Ukraine and Georgia. The Putin administration
communicated to the US that Russia would wreck Ukraine but would not let
it become part of NATO and European Union and this eastward expansion of
these two organisations led towards Ukrainian crisis (Mearsheimer,
2014). Moreover, the US maneuvered international organizations to pursue
its vested interests in the world. For example, in the Gulf War of 1991,
the US through the platform of the United Nations Security Council got
an endorsement to intervene in Kuwait to liberate her from Iraqi
occupation. Similarly, the US intervention in Yugoslavia and Somalia
also came under the banner of the UNSC and NATO. US intervention in
Afghanistan also came while utilizing the UNSC forum. Under the UNSC
Resolution 1386 (2001) American invaded Afghanistan. Moreover, **[[the
norm of multilateralism was exploited by the US]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
when the US intervened in Libya. Thus, to wind up the argument, the US
wanted more states to become part of a global network of international
organizations (Kissinger, 1994, p.805). **[The third goal of liberal
hegemony is [to promote global capitalism]{.mark} (Mearsheimer, 2018).
The US as a leader of the capitalist world promoted free trade,
multinational corporations, and forces of globalization]{.underline}**
(Kissinger, 2014, p. 364,368,369) (Kissinger, 1994, p.804, 805). The
driving forces of globalization are trade, finance, technology, and
communication. According to Liberal economists, the end product of these
forces of globalization is prosperity and peace in the world. Global
capitalism favors forces of globalisation. As a result, there is more
interconnectedness among states. Global trade has increased many folds.
Moreover, because of the availability of finance, more states are
relying on global financial institutions such as the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Furthermore, due to technology,
economic institutions have been transformed. Now, states as well as
non-state actors can easily interact with one another. Time and space
have been shrunk and squeezed (Baylis, 2020). As a result of all these
processes, the world has become a global village. Globalization promotes
complex interdependence among states and which eventually reduces
likelihood of wars among states. Thus, the US pursued liberal ideas of
global capitalism and wanted more and more countries to embed with
global economic institutions in order to promote prosperity and peace in
the world. The assumed benefits of pursuing liberal hegemony were to
eliminate human rights violations in the entire globe. **[However, the
US justification for intervention in Somalia, Iraq, Libya, Syria and
Ukraine to protect universal human rights was [liberal delusion]{.mark}
rather the US intervention in these states [created a power vacuum that
resulted in intense rivalries]{.mark} among various factions which
[ensued in bloodshed and anarchy]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Hamasaeed,
Nada, 2020, p.1) (Boke, 2016).

SPark

**[Ukraine]{.underline}**, per se, is not the issue. It **[is tragically
a war-ravaged pawn in a much larger conflict]{.underline}**. Nor is the
issue about either Russian President Vladimir Putin or US President Joe
Biden as leaders. The same history and confrontation would prevail on
their successors. Meanwhile, former US president Donald Trump's effort
to force change on China by imposing the biggest sanctions action in
history (that is, a trade war and a tariff war) utterly failed. Trump
was caught up in the same history as Biden, even if each focused on
attacking the Russian-Chinese alliance differently.

**[Eventually, some compromise will end the Ukraine war. Both sides will
likely declare victory and blame the war on the other among propaganda
blizzards]{.underline}**. The Russian side will stress demilitarisation,
denazification, and protection of Russians in eastern Ukraine. The
Ukraine side will stress freedom, independence, and national
self-determination. **[Meanwhile, [the tragedy goes beyond Ukraine's
suffering]{.mark}. [The]{.mark} entire [world is caught up in]{.mark}
the decline of one [capitalist empire]{.mark} and the rise of yet
another. [Conflicts between the capitalist empires]{.mark} can [occur
anywhere where differences]{.mark} between them [flare
up]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Perhaps **[[the greatest tragedy]{.mark} [lies in]{.mark} [not
recognising the responsibility of the capitalist system]{.mark} [with
its markets]{.mark} of competing enterprises run/dominated by the
minorities we call employers. [That]{.mark} system [lies at the root of
these historic repetitions]{.mark}. The minority employer class controls
or is the leadership of the nations that have absorbed and reproduced
the competition that capitalism entails. The majority employee class
pays most of the costs on both sides]{.underline}** (in dead, wounded,
destroyed properties, refugee lives and taxes). **[[A different economic

**[Vladimir [Putin's war]{.mark} engine [is being sustained]{.mark} not
just [by European payments for Russian oil and gas]{.mark} but [also by
a complicit class of "lumpen-bourgeoisie" motivated solely by the
trappings of material wealth]{.mark}. Ukrainians, and everyone else, are
[learning the]{.mark} hard [way]{.mark} how [global capitalism trumps
democracy and human rights.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

LJUBLJANA -- The so-called oligarchs in Russia and other ex-communist
countries are a bourgeois counterpart to what Marx called the
lumpen-proletariat: an unthinking cohort susceptible to political
manipulation because its members have no class consciousness or
revolutionary potential of their own. Unlike the proletariat, however,
the lumpen-bourgeoisie who emerged in these countries from the late
1980s onward control capital -- lots of it -- thanks to wild
"privatization" of state-owned assets.

An exemplary case is Rok Snežič, a collaborator and friend of Slovenia's
right-wing prime minister, Janez Janša. An "independent tax adviser,"
Snežič helps Slovene companies redomicile in the lower-tax jurisdiction
of Republika Srpska (the Serb part of Bosnia and Herzegovina). He
apparently has no private possessions, and he has erased his own past
tax bills by declaring bankruptcy.

Yet Snežič also cruises around in new luxury cars and has the means to
pay for jumbo billboard ads. He is officially employed by a company
owned by his wife, where he receives a monthly salary of €37,362
(\$40,346) in cash.

But "normal" capitalism also generates a lumpen-bourgeoisie. Snežič is
not so different from Donald Trump, who similarly thrives precisely
because he stands for nothing, motivated solely by money and the
trappings of material wealth.

**[[Market values]{.mark} have also [determined the contours of Russia's
war in Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}**, whose president, Volodymyr
Zelensky, appears to have had a crash course in how global capitalism
and democracy really work. **[[Since the start of the war, Europe has
sent Russia almost \$40 billion in payments for oil and gas]{.mark},
prompting his observation that [Western countries are more concerned
about rising energy prices than Ukrainian lives]{.mark}. [The capitalist
market]{.mark} -- the one that [has been fueling the Russian war engine
-- has forsaken Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[Ending this]{.mark} bloody trade [would require governments to
abandon their reliance on market mechanisms and]{.mark} start
[organiz]{.mark}ing [energy supply]{.mark} directly, as would
[addressing the global food crises that Russia's war is
generating]{.mark}]{.underline}**. (In addition to being two of the
world's biggest wheat exporters, Russia and Ukraine are also major
sources of chemical fertilizers for Europe.) Paradoxically, only
measures recalling the newborn Soviet Union's "war communism" can save
Ukraine and preserve Western power. **[After all, Russia is coordinating
with China not only to challenge the West geopolitically but also to
depose the US dollar and the euro as global currencies.]{.underline}**

### Surveillance Capitalism Scenario

[\*\*]{.mark} This is a link scenario that I found for the concept of
surveillance capitalism which is very similar to (it is basically)
cybernetics + securitization

The link has two large stages?. The first is that the securitization of
threats is used to justify the use of surveillance, as was the case with
the war on terror

The second stage says that the US, by expanding the technosphere through
the aff and also securitization as mentioned above, inevitably takes
tech from companies, allowing those companies to access the surveillance
data that they gain, therefore causing Surveillance Capitalism

The reason why capitalism is important in this process is because
capitalism is what drives companies and the government to

1 - buy and sell data representing futuristic probabilistic human
behavior

2 - want to gain a competitive edge on other nations and agents, making
them actively check other states using surveillance

3 - use surveillance target anti-capitalist agents which prevents
beneficial change

BUT if you wanted to use it for another file, I am pretty sure that it
would still work fine with a bit of re-formatting

Sorry for the bad explanation but that should have everything I had in
mind while organizing these links/impacts - Spark

Also, if anyone who is cutting cybernetic cards needs a good source, the
text [Surveillance Capitalism and Crisis]{.underline} and [Privacy and
Data Protection: Solving or Reproducing the Democratic Crisis of the
Neoliberal Capitalism?]{.underline} seemed to have a lot of good stuff.

#### Information awareness and its justification is a vehicle for capitalism. Companies use their intel and data to shut down capitalist opposition.

The Post-Cold War, **[global [intelligence

**[[was]{.underline}]{.mark}** then **[[applied to]{.mark} a key problem
[big capital]{.mark} faced]{.underline}** after the collapse of the USSR
triggered a global restructuring of production: **[the existence of a
billion-size surplus population]{.underline}**, **[a reserve army of
labour for which no employment was to be expected]{.underline}**.
[**[This]{.underline}**]{.mark} required devising control strategies of
various types. After 9/11, the **[NeoCons]{.underline}**
**[[revived]{.underline}]{.mark}** the War on Terror concept to stir and
then repress segments of this vast reserve army of labour, developing
**[[the notion of Total Information Awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
allow it to **[[know in advance]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[[not
just]{.mark} the intentions of [rival states]{.mark} ranged against the
West or just insufficiently submissive, [but more particularly]{.mark},
the potential [systemic opposition to capitalism]{.mark} at home and
abroad.]{.underline}** Using double agent tactics as well as provocation
and targeted assassination, **[[this]{.mark} has [created the condition
of endless war and a politics of fear]{.mark} sustaining it. Politics
and society today operate]{.underline}** under a permanent state of
exception **[in which [the Internet]{.mark} has been [turned
into]{.mark} [a]{.mark} vast [search engine]{.mark} [on the lookout
for]{.mark} meaningful [opposition]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Meanwhile in
the name of weeding out 'fake news', the big Internet companies such as
**[[Google]{.mark} have [changed]{.mark} their [algorithms to
prevent]{.mark}]{.underline}** Left **[[websites from popping
up]{.underline}]{.mark}** in searches by the public: **[the [World
Socialist Website]{.mark}, [Global Research]{.mark}, and others, have
already experienced sharp declines in]{.underline}** numbers of
**[visitors]{.underline}** (Tveten 2018: 22). Facebook takes orders from
the United States and Israeli governments to remove accounts (Greenwald
2017). Why do these large Internet companies collaborate, and why do
they collaborate with these two governments specifically? That is what I
intend the clarify in the pages that follow.

#### Securitization of information causes violent regimes of fear and control -- war on terror proves

**[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}** has **[sought to
[turn its]{.mark} historic [advantage of hosting]{.mark} the world's key
[IT]{.mark} industries [into a competitive
advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Profiting]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[from its military]{.underline}** pre-eminence, its role as the
provider of the world's reserve currency, and enjoying the privilege of
running permanent budget, commercial, and current account deficits,
**[the US worked with the IT firms [to establish a global security
state]{.mark} grounded [in 'Total Information
Awareness']{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[This is [the link between the
surveillance regime]{.mark}]{.underline}** (which includes the voluntary
deposition of personal data in social media) and the War on Terror.
**[[On the basis of]{.mark} its [information]{.mark} advantage, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [keeps global society in a state of
tension]{.mark} by a range of military and intelligence activities
[targeting 'demographic bulges']{.mark}]{.underline}** in the reserve
army of labour. In the process, **[even [risking or provoking acts of
violence]{.mark} against US/Western targets is part of the scenario
because this allows armed control to be imposed. A domestic politics of
fear has been deployed to win public support]{.underline}**.

All **[this was explicitly discussed as a single project in the
Israeli-US NeoCon discussions on a War on Terror]{.underline}**. It was
originally worked out in the early 1980s and revived after the Twin
Towers attacks on 9/11, combining the attack on terrorists **[with
pre-emptive war against 'states supporting terror' as well as imposing
the corollary surveillance regime and suspending a range of
freedoms]{.underline}** on the home front.

Ultimately the doctrine behind the global strategy of tension entails
the explicit option and regular practice of targeted assassination of
opponents. 'The subliminal purpose of terror tactics,' Douglas Valentine
argues in his book on the 'Phoenix' assassination programme in Vietnam,
'was to drive people into a state of infantile dependence. In this
sense, **[[the CIA]{.mark} psy\[chological\] war\[fare\]
experts]{.underline}** were not exorcists come to heal Vietnam and
**[liberate it from Communist demons; their spells were meant to break
up the society and [project its]{.mark} repressed [homicidal impulses
onto the Communists']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Valentine 2000: 63,
emphasis added). This insight still today applies to the condition of
Western society in the War on Terror. As Dominick Jenkins observes, the
Bush administration began the practice of making al-Qaeda a blank screen
for the people's fears; the spectacular theatrics of the Twin Towers
collapses was exploited to show 'the existence of a new kind of
terrorist network with the power to threaten civilisation itself'
(Jenkins 2002: 265).

SPark

ZUBOFF: I define **[[surveillance capitalism]{.mark} as [the unilateral
claiming of private human experience as free raw material]{.mark} for
translation into behavioral data. These data are then computed and
packaged as prediction products and sold into behavioral futures
markets]{.underline}** --- business customers with a commercial interest
in knowing what we will do now, soon, and later**[. [It was Google that
first learned]{.mark} how [to capture surplus behavioral data]{.mark},
more than what they needed for services, and used it [to compute
prediction products]{.mark}]{.underline}** that they could sell to their
business customers, in this case advertisers. But I argue that
surveillance capitalism is no more restricted to that initial context
than, for example, mass production was restricted to the fabrication of
Model T's.

Right from the start at **[[Google]{.underline}]{.mark}** it was
understood that users were unlikely to agree to this unilateral claiming
of their experience and its translation into behavioral data. It was
**[[understood]{.mark} that these [methods had to be]{.mark}
[undetectable]{.mark}. So from the start the logic reflected [the social
relations of the one-way mirror]{.mark}. [They]{.mark} [were able to see
and]{.mark} to [take]{.mark} --- and to do this [in a way]{.mark} that
[we could not contest]{.mark} because we had no way to know what was
happening.]{.underline}**

We rushed to the internet expecting empowerment, the democratization of
knowledge, and help with real problems, but **[[surveillance
capitalism]{.mark} really [was]{.mark} just [too lucrative]{.mark} to
resist]{.underline}**. **[[This economic logic]{.mark} has now [spread
beyond the tech companies to new surveillance--based ecosystems in
virtually every economic sector]{.mark}, from insurance to automobiles
to health, education, finance, to every product described as "smart" and
every service described as "personalized."]{.underline}** By now it's
very difficult to participate effectively in society without interfacing
with these same channels that are supply chains for surveillance
capitalism's data flows. For example, ProPublica recently reported that
breathing machines purchased by people with sleep apnea are secretly
sending usage data to health insurers, where the information can be used
to justify reduced insurance payments.

**[[Emerging from]{.underline}]{.mark}** the background of the
**[[neoliberal]{.mark} financial [capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark}** capitalism **[[exhibits and

critical]{.underline}** **[[challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
democracy. The **[[mutual interdependence and
reciprocity]{.underline}]{.mark}** between the capitalist economy and
the masses, already significantly undermined by financial capitalism,
**[[are]{.mark} further [eliminated]{.mark} in surveillance capitalism
[where people are technologically mediated]{.mark}, structural [excluded
from the processes of capital extraction]{.mark} and accumulation and
[rendered merely as raw materials]{.mark}. Due to the exclusion from the
processes of value creation and accumulation, people are deprived of
their bargaining power to ask for more equal redistribution of the value
that surveillance economy creates.]{.underline}** In surveillance
capitalism, **[[the deprivation of the bargaining power is]{.mark} more
[covert]{.mark}]{.underline}** and subtler thanks to the unprecedented
consumerism of our age. The surveillant capitalists give people little
treats such as customized services, convenience and ideas about smart
life and meanwhile create an illusion for the consumers about greater
control over one's life. **[[Such an illusion reassures the one-sided
ownership and control]{.mark} over the means of
production]{.underline}** of surveillance capitalism
**[by]{.underline}** the surveillant **[companies]{.underline}**.
**[They face little risk of a revolt of the consumers]{.underline}**,
since simply showing the consumers a new device can already make them
happy and excited. **[The one-sided control]{.underline}** over the
means of production and processes of value creation [causes **[not only
economic inequalities]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[in the sense
that]{.mark} the raw material-like [consumers]{.mark} whose behavioural
data have generated enormous capital value [do not have a fair
share]{.mark} because their use of the services such as social media is
not recognized as labour.]{.underline}** 43 **[[It also creates the
inequality about who]{.mark} [get to determine and control one's way of
life.]{.mark} In surveillance capitalism which operates a market for
future behaviour, the predictions of future behaviour guide all sorts of
economic activities, and the products and services offered to consumers
are designed to maintain this business model and to keep it evermore
lucrative. As people's way of life is increasingly mediated and
conditioned by those services and products, the surveillant companies
become more and more effective in superimposing their predictions of
future behaviour on consumers]{.underline}**. The totalization of a
hyper surveillance capitalism **[[creates]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
feelings of **[[dispossession]{.underline}]{.mark}** and appropriation
of one's own lifeworld and lack of alternatives except resignation from
such a cybernetic world.

**[Surveillance capitalism also reinforces]{.underline}** the idea of an
impersonal and perfectly rational market that **[neoliberal
capitalism]{.underline}** has been propagating for a few decades.
Wolfgang Streeck describes such a rhetoric of Hayekian market justice,
"it is claimed that market justice, with its ostensible impersonality
and price-theoretical calculability, functions in accordance with
universalist principles, in a 'clean' manner in the sense of untouched
by politics."44 It is important to notice that such a rhetoric often
defends the capitalist economy against state's redistributive
interventions and depicts the latter as political and therefore corrupt.
The claim of surveillance capitalism about the full transparency and
complete knowledge about human affairs through datafication and
digitalization certainly strengthens the rhetoric about the perfect
rationality and purity of the capitalist market, and hence makes the
redistribution policies addressing social justice issues not only
unnecessary but a threat to the market's purity and rationality. The
acclaimed impersonality, objectivity and rationality of the knowledge
produced by surveillance capitalism are simultaneously accompanied by
its authority of truthfulness and facticity and hence the legitimacy of
its superimposition on human affairs. But such **[knowledge is
accessible and intelligible only to the elites of]{.underline}** the
surveillance **[capitalism]{.underline}**. **[The rationalization and
legitimation of their power are a significant step forward to what
Wolfgang Merkel calls a "[dictatorship of the
market]{.mark}"]{.underline}**. 45

#### Internal Link + Impact - Their use of the government to expand technology is entrenched in the concept of surveillance capitalism - it destroys democracy by viewing humans as products to be rendered AND is an epistemological catastrophe that is ultimately false

So, **[[digital surveillance]{.mark} of people's behaviours and the
world people live in [becomes an integral part of the capital
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Zuboff describes the four steps in the
new way of value extraction in surveillance capitalism:

"First, **[[the push for more]{.mark} users and more channels, services,
devices, [places, and spaces]{.mark} [is imperative]{.mark} for access
[to an ever-expanding range]{.mark} of behavioural surplus. [Users
are]{.mark} the]{.underline}** human nature-al **[[resource that
provides]{.mark} this [free raw material]{.mark}. Second, [the
application of machine learning]{.mark}, [a]{.mark}rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence, [and data science]{.mark} for continuous
algorithmic improvement [constitutes]{.mark} [an]{.mark} immensely
expensive, sophisticated, and exclusive twenty-first century "[means of
production]{.mark}."]{.underline}** Third, **[the new manufacturing
process [converts behavioural surplus into prediction products]{.mark}
designed to predict behaviour]{.underline}** now and soon. Fourth,
**[[these prediction products are sold]{.mark} into a new kind of
meta-market that trades exclusively in future behaviour... Surveillance
capitalism's profits derive primarily, if not entirely, from such
markets for future behaviour."]{.underline}**

**[[All]{.mark} the four [steps]{.mark} contain elements that [are
exploitive and nondemocratic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To start with,
**[[the]{.mark} installation of [equipment and technologies]{.mark} for
[surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline}** online and offline by the
surveillant companies **[[are]{.mark} often [unilateral and
creepy]{.mark}, and often in the disguise of providing better services,
more convenience and customizing user experiences. [People's realization
and complaint]{.mark}]{.underline}** about the intrusiveness of
commercial surveillance often **[[come too late and make little
difference, because]{.mark} the [tech giants' have the capacity to shape
users' habits and way of thinking]{.mark}]{.underline}** and to make
users increasingly dependent on the services that create more
behavioural data. What follow the generation of behavioural data are
even more obscure to ordinary users, not least because people normally
lack the information and knowledge about the means of production by
which their behavioural data are processed into commodities. **[The
surveillance capitalism that operates the market for future behaviour is
simply not people-facing, unlike the industrial capitalism that relied
on the masses]{.underline}** for labour input and consumption **[and had
to constantly face the demands of the working class. In surveillance
capitalism, commodities are produced by information technologies and
consumed by other data-driven entities. [This economic structure]{.mark}
largely [precludes any meaningful]{.mark} active [engagement]{.mark} of
people from the processes of]{.underline}** capital
**[production]{.underline}** and accumulation. **[[The exploitative
nature]{.mark} of this surveillance economy [lies]{.mark} precisely [in
this preclusion]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As people are often unaware of
how their behavioural data make profits and how they are ultimately
consumed by the companies who trade the data commodities about the
predictions of their future behaviours, people hardly consider
themselves as being "working" for the surveillant companies and hence
deserve a share of their profits, especially as the services and devices
that extract and collect behavioural data are often used in the time and
space of leisure and domicile. 35 Unable to actively engage in the
processes of surveillance capitalism as either labour input or
consumers, **[[people are converted into data and become raw materials
for value extraction]{.mark} by the surveillant
companies.]{.underline}**

**[[This structural exclusion]{.mark} of surveillance capitalism
[is]{.mark}]{.underline}** perhaps **[[most dramatic in]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** socalled **[[data]{.underline}]{.mark}** broker
**[[industry]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Data brokers acquire the data
typically not by way of direct interaction with people themselves. 36
**[According to a report made by the US Federal Trade
Commission]{.underline}** on nine major data brokers in 2014, **[data
broker [companies acquire]{.mark} the [data by buying them from]{.mark}
commercial entities, [government agencies]{.mark} or other data brokers,
trawling public information such as court records and census data, and
running programmes]{.underline}** -- the socalled web crawlers -- to
systematically browse and capture data on the internet. 37 Once
acquired, data are developed into various commodities to be sold for
various purposes, including targeted advertising and marketing, identity
verification and fraud detection. **[[The clients of the data]{.mark}
broker industry [include a]{.mark} wide range of commercial [enterprises
as well as governmental]{.mark} and nongovernmental
[organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[There are also often
long-term relationships where]{.mark} the [client entities are also the
data sources for the data brokers]{.mark}]{.underline}** by way of
cooperative arrangements.38 The products of the data broker industry can
be the actual, raw, unstructured data from the data sources or the
processed data segments such as group profiles. While quality control of
the data product is necessarily important, **[it does not]{.underline}**
mean that quality control **[allows for people to have access to their
data and to ask for correction or deletion of the wrong or inaccurate
information]{.underline}** about them. For one thing, as data brokers
are not consumer-facing, their existence and business activities are
invisible and unknown to people, and their invisibility effectively
pre-empts possible information requests. For another, individual
verification of the accuracy of the personal data matters little when
the data-driven companies deal with massive amount of raw and derived,
non-personal data or rely on these data products for decision or
strategy-making. The solution to quality control is often technical:
increasing the investment in advanced data analytics and enlarging
databases to make better inferences, validate the data products and
remove the chances of false positive. 39 The means of production, hence,
is a technological and organizational enclosure that does not need any
active engagement of the people.

**[What underpins [the]{.mark} [surveillance capitalism's relationship
of production]{.mark} [that]{.mark} excludes people's active engagement
and [renders people into raw materials]{.mark} [is]{.mark} an
[extraordinary epistemic presumption]{.mark}. It is the belief that
people's behaviours have patterns which can be observed and extracted
into a form of probabilistic knowledge based on which decisions can be
m]{.underline}**ade. This belief is itself not new. Biological studies
tell us that life itself requires constantly monitoring the living
environment and adapting oneself to the environment and that the
recognition of patterns is inherent in this process. But it is not
simply that the epistemic presumption has caused the means of production
and economic structure of surveillance capitalism. **[Surveillance
capitalism, embracing this epistemic presumption, also produces its own
form of knowledge about human beings, market and the world and
superimposes on them such probabilistic knowledge as facts through
massive expansion and deepening of digital mediation and conversion. The
primary task is to render human behaviour and interaction increasingly
and evermore transparent by these digital devices and technologies.
Whereas [knowledge or information obtained from human interactions can
only be limited and partial]{.mark}, [surveillance capitalism believes
that a universal, complete knowledge]{.mark} about human affairs through
digital mediation [is]{.mark} more and more
[attainable]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The barriers on the way to this
complete knowledge are just technological, which means what we need are
more tools to create, extract and process more data. 40 **[[This
epistemic shift already poses significant challenges to]{.mark} the
traditional liberal [humanism on which democracy is premised]{.mark}.
Whereas the [inherent finiteness of human knowledge requires]{.mark} us
to [constant]{.mark}ly [reflect]{.mark} on the acquired
knowledge]{.underline}**, [and]{.mark} as Mireille Hildebrandt argues,
**[[this conscious]{.mark} reflection on our limited knowledge [gives us
the freedom to deliberate]{.mark} on them and to decide what to do with
them]{.underline}**, 41 **[[the acclaimed full transparency and complete
knowledge of human affairs]{.mark} and the living environment would
[eliminate]{.mark} the need for [such]{.mark} conscious reflection and
[deliberation]{.mark}. [It does not just make]{.mark}
[self-determination, autonomy and the moral capacity]{.mark} to realize
and overcome the inherent limitation of someone's experience and
judgment even [more fictive]{.mark}. [It also makes institutions such as
the rule of law]{.mark}]{.underline}** and market
**[[unnecessary]{.underline}]{.mark}**, precisely **[[because these
are]{.mark} the [institutions designed to]{.mark} [foster]{.mark} the
mutual [trust and common interest]{.mark} in a world [where]{.mark}
human behaviour and [interaction are uncertain and cannot be fully
known]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 42 **[[The execution of this epistemic
presumption]{.mark} by surveillant companies in practice [is a]{.mark}
particular [way of making people passive objects]{.mark} [whose current
and future behaviours become always knowable and hence
controllable]{.mark}. And]{.underline}** by **[making people passive
objects]{.underline}**, surveillance capitalists have no need to
maintain a positive feedback loop and a social pact of reciprocity with
them and hence no need for democratic institutions to address their
needs.

discovery of the surplus value]{.mark} of users' behavioural data [and
its expansion of the digitalization of human

discovery is, we cannot forget the anti-commercialism and cyber
liberalism embraced by Google in its early days. Chastising
advertiser-sponsored search engines for their inherent biases towards
advertisers, Google advocated for dispassionate algorithms that offered
better search results by learning from users' search-related data. 32
However, **[[due to the increasing pressure from investors in the

the ads that could be useful and informative for users. The matchmaking
was done with Google's sophisticated analytical capacities to measure
the quality of the landing page of the ad, the relevance of the ad to
the search terms or keywords, and above all the percentage of times
users actually click on a given ad appeared on a result page. 33 **[The

The Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space was formed
in 1992 at a meeting in Washington, D.C., and has been the leading group
internationally challenging the weaponization and nuclearization of
space.

Its coordinator, Bruce Gagnon, in a 2021 interview with me, said: "The
**[aerospace industry has long proclaimed that 'Star Wars' would be the
largest industrial project in human history]{.underline}**. Add the
**[[nuclear industry's ambition to use space as its 'new
market]{.underline}]{.mark}**,' and one can imagine the money that would
be involved. These two **[industry giants have put their resources
together to ensure their 'control and domination' of the
U.S.]{.underline}** Congress. Both political parties are virtually
locked down when it comes to **[[appropriating funds to move the arms
race into space and to colonize the heavens for corporate
profits.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Just one **[example is the recent
approval in Congress of the creation of the 'Space Force']{.underline}**
as a new service branch in the military."

"During the Trump administration (with the Democrats in control of the
House of Representatives) the Space Force was 'stood up' as they like to
say in the biz," said Gagnon. "The Democrats could have stopped the
creation of this new military branch. During the little congressional
debate that did occur, the only thing the Democrats requested was to
call it the 'Space Corps' (like the Marine Corps). It's a **[rigged game
in Washington when it comes to handing out money to the aerospace
industry."]{.underline}**

Gagnon continued: "In his book, The Pentagon's New Map: War and Peace in
the 2lst Century, former Navy War College Professor Thomas Barnett
writes that, under globalization of the world economy, every country
will have a different role. We won't produce shoes, cars, phones,
washing machines and the like in the U.S. anymore because it is cheaper
for **[[industry to exploit labor in the global
south.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Our role in the **[[U.S]{.underline}]{.mark}**., Barnett says, **[[will
be 'security export]{.underline}]{.mark}**.' That means we will
**[[endlessly fight wars in the parts of the world where nations are
not]{.underline}]{.mark}** yet '**[[fully integrated' into corporate
capitalism.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Having a dominant military in space
would **[enable the U.S. to see, hear and target everything on the
Earth."]{.underline}**

"In order to put together a global 'Leviathan' military capability,"
Gagnon continued, "space must be militarized and weaponized. **[[The
cost of doing so is enormous and requires cuts in social and
environmental spending and larger contributions from NATO member
nations]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

"In addition to **[[using space technology to control Earth on behalf of
corporate capital]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the new Space Force will have
another key job. They will be tasked with attempting to control the
pathway on and off the planet Earth. In the 1989 Congressional Study
entitled Military Space Forces: The Next 50 Years, congressional staffer
John Collins writes on pages 24 and 25: "Nature reserves decisive
advantage for L4 and L5, two allegedly stable \[space\] libration points
that theoretically could dominate Earth and moon, because they look down
both gravity wells. No other location is equally commanding.... Armed
forces might lie in wait at that location to hijack rival shipments on
return."

Privatized Gold Rush

"The **[[Pentagon is looking to a future where space would be fully
privatized]{.underline}]{.mark}** and a new gold rush would ensue.
**[Corporations]{.underline}** **[and rich fat-cats like Jeff Bezos,
Elon Musk and Richard Branson]{.underline}**, while
**[ignoring]{.underline}** the UN's Outer Space and Moon **[[Treaties
that call the heavens the 'province of all
mankind,]{.underline}]{.mark}**' would move to control the shipping
lanes from Earth into space. The Space Force would be used by these
'space entrepreneurs' as their own private pirate forces to ensure they
controlled the extraction of resources mined from planetary bodies. This
provocative vision would in the end **[[recreate the global war
system]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which has been deeply embedded into the
culture and consciousness here on Earth. Russia, China and other
space-faring nations are not going to allow the U.S. to be the 'Master
of Space.'"

#### 2 - Expansion - The Space Race to constantly grow and expand to new frontiers is ultimate capitalism-the growth on growth liberal virus denies morality

Tim **Jackson 21**\[Tim Jackson, Professor of Sustainable Development
and Director of the Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable
Prosperity (CUSP) at the University of Surrey, \"Opinion: The
billionaire space race is the ultimate symbol of capitalism's flawed
obsession with growth\",7-21-2021, TheJournal.ie,

**[[The space rhetoric of the super-rich]{.underline}]{.mark}** betrays
a mentality that may once have served humanity well. Some would say
**[[it's a quintessential feature of capitalism. Innovation upon
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[A driving ambition to expand and
explore]{.underline}**. A primal **[urge to escape our origins and reach
for the next horizon]{.underline}**. **[[Space]{.mark} travel [is a
natural extension of our obsession with economic
growth.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It's the **[[crowning jewel of
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Further and faster is its frontier
creed.

I've spent much of my professional life as a critic of that creed, not
just for environmental reasons but on social grounds as well. The seven
years I spent as economics commissioner on the UK's Sustainable
Development Commission and my subsequent research at the Centre for the
Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity revealed something fundamental
about our aspirations for the good life. Something that has been
underlined by the experience of the pandemic.

**[[Prosperity is]{.underline}]{.mark}** as much
**[[about]{.underline}]{.mark}** health as it is about wealth. Ask
people what matters most in their lives and the chances are that this
will come out somewhere near the top of the list. Health for themselves.
Health for their friends and their families. Health too -- sometimes --
for **[[the fragile planet on which we live and on whose health we
ourselves depend]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

There's something fascinating in this idea. Because it confronts the
obsession with growth head on. As Aristotle pointed out in Nicomachean
Ethics (a book named after his physician father), the good life is not a
relentless search for more, but a continual process of finding a
"virtuous" balance between too little and too much.

**[Population health provides an obvious example of this
idea]{.underline}**. Too little food and we're struggling with diseases
of malnutrition. Too much and we're tipped into the "**[diseases of
affluence" that now kill more people than under-nutrition
does]{.underline}**. Good health depends on us finding and nurturing
this balance.

This task is always tricky of course, even at the individual level. Just
think about the challenge of keeping your exercise, your diet and your
appetites in line with the outcome of a healthy body weight. But as I've
argued, living inside a system that has its sights continually focused
on more makes the task near impossible. Obesity has tripled since 1975.
Almost two-fifths of adults over 18 are overweight. Capitalism not only
fails to recognise the point where balance lies. It has absolutely no
idea how to stop when it gets there.

You'd think our brush with mortality through the pandemic would have
brought some of this home to us. You'd think it would give us pause for
thought about what really matters to us: the kind of world we want for
our children; the kind of society we want to live in. And for many
people it has. In a survey carried out during lockdown in the UK, 85% of
respondents found something in their changed conditions they felt worth
keeping and fewer than 10% wanted a complete return to normal.

When life and health are at stake, **[[the ungodly scramble for wealth
and status feels less and less attractive]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Even
the **[lure of technology pales]{.underline}**. Family, conviviality and
a sense of purpose come to the fore. These are the things that many
people found they lacked most throughout the pandemic. But their
importance in our lives was not a COVID accident: they are the most
fundamental elements of a sustainable prosperity.

#### 3 - Satellites - Satellites are the epitome of space capitalism-unregulated and exploited

**[["Space junk" makes up]{.mark} a significant proportion of the
guesstimated]{.underline}** **[[500,000 plus
objects]{.underline}]{.mark}** floating around in orbit. About 23,000 of
these objects are currently being tracked and maintained by the US
Strategic Command. These so-called resident space objects are either
**[satellites still in use or are known objects no longer fit for
purpose]{.underline}**. They could be as small as a tennis ball or the
size of a double decker bus. In addition, however, there are hundreds of
thousands of other objects -- bolts, exploded satellite pieces, large
rockets and other space debris -- that are unaccounted for.

Efforts have been made to try to consolidate public with private data on
what is up there but, for various reasons**[[, the space community does
not openly share information on where all objects are
located.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Lack of regulation

For the entrepreneurially inclined, it is probably not that surprising
to hear **[[many are taking advantage of the severe lack of regulation
in space]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Sure why wouldn't you? Moreover why
would anyone publicly disclose how and where their interests lie in a
given market, intergalactic or otherwise, if they weren't obliged to?

But space **[isn't just another market]{.underline}**. Thinking one can
apply the same rules up there as we use on earth is shortsighted for so
many reasons.

Down here the **[economic "unknowns" are known. Space is replete with
unknown unknowns]{.underline}**. If a satellite that is used to collect
data to sell on to business customers one day stops sending data, and
you haven't the foggiest notion why, what do you tell the customers?
**[[How do you attribute cause]{.underline}]{.mark}**? How does a
company predict the likelihood of loss or damage to its equipment in
space or perform other prudent exercises before getting into the space
game?

One of the chief concerns for any new business is risk and how to
mitigate it. There **[couldn't be a much riskier bet than entering a
market with no regulation, patchy knowledge of your competitors'
location or size, and to top it all off, little understanding of the
physical environment within which the business will
operate.]{.underline}**

42\. [[Non-kinetic means]{.mark}, for example, cyber hacking, laser
dazzling, or the emission of electromagnetic pulses, can also be used to
interrupt or disable rather than destroy satellites. While considered
less damaging to the space environment and potentially less traceable,
many forms of non-kinetic attacks are very difficult to attribute,
stirring fears of quick **escalation** and questions of proportionality
of response in a near future conflict where space-assets would likely be
involved. [**Russia and China are already heavily invested** in this
domain]{.mark}, ultimately seeking the means to **disrupt US hegemony in
space** (Pellegrino, Stang, 2016).]{.underline}

Non-kinetic means: cyber-attacks, jamming, spoofing, and dazzling

43\. [Because of the resulting debris, which can have a **mutually
destabilising** impact, destroying satellites with kinetic force is not
an ideal method for damaging satellite capability. Non-destructive and
covert methods, such as cyber-attacks]{.underline}, jamming, spoofing,
or dazzling [are alternative means to disrupt and deny access to
satellite capabilities. In fact, space warfare is more likely to involve
the denial of vital information flows supporting command and control of
an enemy's forces, rather than the exoatmospheric destruction of its
space-based assets.]{.underline}

44\. By attacking a satellite's control system, or mission package, [an
actor could take over control of the satellite, shut it down, change its
orbit, put it on collision course with other space objects, or destroy
its solar panels]{.underline} by exposing it to damaging levels of
radiation. In addition, a satellite's global network of ground stations
might be subject to attack with potential serious consequences. 45.
Rather than ASAT weaponry, [cyber-attacks can instead be used to take
control of a satellite or **the whole communication network**, including
the ground stations]{.underline} (Suzuki, 2016). [As implied above,
cybersecurity and space security are **inherently linked**.]{.underline}
As satellite technologies and space assets are sourced from a broad
international supply base they require regular security upgrades to
their software systems via remote, distributed connections, which make
them vulnerable to cyber-attacks (Livingstone and Lewis, 2016).

46\. Due to the nature of their missions, the military pays more
attention than commercial operators to the defence of their space
systems. As a result, commercial satellite telecommunications are more
often than not less resilient than military ones. Still, as [commercial
satellites are increasingly co-opted or leased for military
communications or other civilian mission-critical functions such as air
traffic control, train rail traffic, electrical **grid
management**]{.underline}, and other critical civilian infrastructure,
[commercial satellites can be considered high-value soft targets for
adversaries]{.underline} (Suzuki, 2016). In addition, radio frequencies
for satellite communications are limited and the increase in the number
of commercial and private satellites puts pressure on scarce resources.
Some operators are therefore using less secure frequencies, which are
easier to hack (Suzuki, 2016).

47\. As such, it is clear a range of cyber threats exists against
space-based systems. The [large amount of data transmitted through
satellites presents an opportunity for adversaries to corrupt accuracy
and reliability with a relatively low probability of discovery. Examples
could be: States seeking a military advantage via the theft of
intellectual property; organised criminal elements with sufficient
resources seeking financial gain; amateur or professional hackers
showing off their skills; or even capable terrorist groups wishing to
disrupt services provided by space-based assets or inflict damage on the
space environment. Of course, **any combination of these threats is also
imaginable** depending on the adversaries's assets and
capabilities]{.underline} (Livingstone and Lewis, 2016).

48\. Satellite feeds can also be jammed via the intentional interference
in signal transmission and reception through the deliberate use of radio
noise and electromagnetic signals. In particular, global navigation
satellite system (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming attacks
because civil applications have not always been designed with security
in mind. Often, jamming of GPS signals or other radio telecommunications
can even be carried out using simple, commercially-available tools
(Suzuki, 2016). By way of example, North Korea has carried out a series
of coordinated jamming attacks against the Republic of Korea, which
affected GNSS signals in the Seoul area and led to the degradation of
infrastructure such as mobile phone networks (Livingstone and Lewis,
2016).

49\. [Spoofing allows an adversary to manipulate]{.underline} the
information about [the location, position and condition of a satellite.
Spoofed data is relatively hard to detect.]{.underline} If successful,
[[the spoofing attack could]{.mark} damage critical infrastructure, such
as the national power grid]{.underline}, by introducing false timing
signals, [[or cause]{.mark} economic [damage by
targeting]{.mark}]{.underline} trading systems [in [the financial
services sector]{.underline}]{.mark} (Livingstone and Lewis, 2016).
[Spoofing could also confuse the coordination of command and control of
a nation's armed forces in a time of crisis.]{.underline}

50\. [Dazzling is a way of blinding a satellite with a laser. If the
laser is powerful enough, it can even burn satellite sensors and disable
them]{.underline} (Airbus Space briefing). Docking and rendez-vous
methods are alternative ways of damaging a satellite by using electronic
or kinetic force. While docking would have the benefit of not producing
space debris, it would expose the attacker to detection. To mitigate the
potential consequences of a docking attack, the United States and its
allies are developing a programme of Space Situational Awareness, which
monitors any objects approaching existing space assets (Suzuki, 2016).

51\. The trend toward the [development of increasingly disruptive and
non-attributable non-kinetic means puts the long-term stability of the
space environment at risk. Increasing dependence on space-based
architecture coupled with hybrid and asymmetrical disruption tactics
will create a space environment ripe for **rapid escalation and
instability.**]{.underline}

V. NATO AND THE SPACE DOMAIN

A. WHY SPACE MATTERS FOR NATO

52\. As is clear from above, [improvements in space technology drive the
development of advanced military systems; they are important force
multipliers when integrated into joint operations.]{.underline}
Therefore, a clear and mutual understanding of how military, civil,
commercial, national and multinational space capabilities contribute to
military operations in order to achieve Alliance security objectives is
essential. Increased awareness about the potential for adversaries
seeking to exploit their own access to space for military purposes to
the detriment of Allied assets and capabilities is vitally important
(NATO Allied Joint Doctrine for Air and Space Operations, 2016).

53\. [At the strategic level, NATO is well positioned to strengthen
deterrence in space[. NATO's]{.mark} collective defence [and economic
prosperity rely on space-based infrastructure]{.mark}, and an attack on
the space assets of [one Ally would impact]{.mark} the security of
[all]{.mark}. As such, **NATO needs a whole-of-alliance approach** to
protect its interests in space [to **enhance resilience and deter any
threat** to its space-based capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the
operational level, space needs to be incorporated in NATO planning and
command structures. At the tactical level, relevant training should be
provided to personnel and NATO exercises should reflect space warfare
scenarios wherein Allied space-assets are denied or temporarily disabled
(Schulte, 2012).

54\. Today's modern operational environment relies heavily on guaranteed
access to space-based architecture -- Allied forces\' daily training,
and maintenance and execution of ongoing operations are all made capable
by a vast network of shared space assets. [Allied space capabilities
provide]{.underline} a number of products and services, including:
[global, strategic and intra-theatre satellite communications;
positioning, navigation and timing services; terrestrial and space
environmental monitoring; real-time space, geological, meteorological
and oceanographic situational awareness; advanced intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities]{.underline}; as well as
NATO Shared Early Warning and transponder tracking such as Friendly
Force tracking and maritime tracking (NATO Allied Joint Doctrine for Air
and Space Operations, 2016).

55\. [NATO's most advanced military systems are dependent upon
space-based assets in order to execute missions successfully,
particularly Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACs), the
Alliance's Ballistic Missile Defence programme, and the Alliance Ground
Surveillance System (AGS),]{.underline} set to become operational in
2017. The AGS system consists of air, ground and support segments and
will perform all-weather and persistent terrestrial and maritime
surveillance in near real-time, contributing to a range of missions1 ,
providing military commanders with a comprehensive picture of the
situation on the ground (GovSat, 2016).

56\. Space capabilities contributing to the Alliance's mission planning
and execution at all levels of warfare come from government, military,
civilian and commercial providers. NATO does not currently own any orbit
spacecraft. It does, however, own and operate several terrestrial
elements (e.g. SATCOM anchor stations and terminals). [The United States
provides the majority of space support NATO currently uses.]{.underline}
However, in 2013, there were approximately 39 'military or government'
satellites owned by NATO Member States other than the US providing
communication, imagery and automatic identification system detection.

57\. The primary European NATO Member States who have space capabilities
are France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy: The availability of
a space capability in support of NATO operations, however, is determined
exclusively by the nation or company that owns the satellite. It should
be noted that France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom have
advanced and capable observation systems supporting their conventional
forces today: they are the Pléiades; SAR-Lupe (radar) and Helios 2
(optical, infrared); COSMO-SkyMed; and Skynet 5 respectively.

58\. Currently the SATCOM Post-2000 programme provides the Alliance with
satellite communications capabilities. The British, French, and Italian
governments work in concert to provide the Alliance with advanced SATCOM
capabilities. Under the signed Memorandum of Understanding between the
three governments, the Alliance is allowed access to the French SYRACUSE
3, the Italian SICRAL 1 and 1Bis, and the British Skynet 4 and 5
military networks (Briefings NATO officials).

59\. The current contract negotiated by the consortium is for a 15-year
period, scheduled to end in 2019. The NATO Communications and
Information Systems Services Agency (NCSA) needs a contract upgrade,
however, as the Alliance's current satellite bandwidth requirements have
outpaced what is available under the current contract. Among other
deficiencies, the current arrangement does not include EHF-/Ka-band
capabilities, which will be critical to future Alliance SATCOM needs (De
Selding, 2016).

60\. To contract the necessary upgrade of its SATCOM capacity, NATO can
look to eight Allies currently developing or in possession of the
satellite capacity necessary for military communications; France,
Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the
United States (De Selding, 2016). In November 2016, NATO awarded a
contract to support the operational phase of the above mentioned AGS
system to Luxembourg's GovSat, an affiliate of satellite operator SES.
Launching in 2017, the GovSat-1 satellite will provide an end-to-end
service including the delivery of satellite capacity in commercial
Ku-band and sensor data communications between the NATO Global Hawk UAVs
and ground segment over the AGS operational area. With this contract,
Luxembourg Authorities and the NCI Agency as procurement executive agent
acquire and manage these services.

61\. While the centrality of space is also recognised in NATO's
Strategic Concept, which mentions technological trends that could
potentially impede access to space (NATO, 2010), NATO has not issued any
policy or military strategy for space operations. So far, only the
Allied Joint Doctrine for Air and Space Operations provides some
guidelines on the role of space support in operational planning. In
2013, NATO also released the NATO Space Handbook, which explains space
fundamentals for commanders and their staff.

B. NATO AND THE SPACE DOMAIN: A WAY FORWARD

62\. [NATO should renew its focus on space cooperation. Every NATO
country relies on safe and reliable access to space assets for both
commerce and military operations.]{.underline} However, [NATO doctrine
and planning have lagged and the Alliance has not issued any military
strategy or policy for space operations.]{.underline} For example, the
Joint Airpower Competence Centre (JAPCC) has proposed a narrow framework
for a NATO Space Policy concentrating on the employment, coordination,
and defence of space capabilities used to support NATO operations and
core business (JAPCC, 2012). Any NATO policy should furthermore be
coherent with existing policies, such as those of the EU and the US. The
JAPCC proposes five guiding principles:

#### 5 - Awareness - the affirmative attempts to become aware of all occurring events through the expansion of satellite capabilities - that links to surveillance and once again to capitalism. Companies use their intel and data to shut down capitalist opposition.

### Space Link Ext. Cards

#### Outer space is in the newest space for capitalism 

Shammas and Holen, 20**19** (Victor L., Work Research Institute. Tomas
B., independent scholar. "One giant leap for capitalistkind: private
enterprise in outer space" Polgrave Communications. January 29, 2019.
[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0218-9
///](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0218-9%20///)MF)

[[Outer space is becoming a space for capitalism]{.mark}. We are
entering a [new era of the commercialization of space]{.mark}, geared
towards generating profits from satellite launches, space tourism,
asteroid mining, and related ventures. This era, driven by private
corporations]{.underline} such as Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos's
Blue Origins, has been labeled by industry insiders as 'NewSpace\'---in
contrast to 'Old Space\', a Cold War-era mode of space relations when
(allegedly) slow-moving, sluggish states dominated outer space. NewSpace
marks the arrival of capitalism in space. While challenging the
libertarian rhetoric of its proponents---space enterprises remain
enmeshed in the state, relying on funding, physical infrastructure,
technology transfers, regulatory frameworks, and symbolic
support---NewSpace nevertheless heralds a novel form of human activity
in space. Despite its humanistic, universalizing pretensions, however,
[NewSpace does not [benefit]{.mark} humankind as such but rather a
[specific set of wealthy entrepreneurs]{.mark}, many of them originating
in Silicon Valley, who strategically deploy humanist tropes to engender
enthusiasm for their activities. We describe this complex as
'capitalistkind\'. Moreover, the [arrival of capitalism in space is
fueled by the expansionary logic of capital accumulation. Outer space
serves as a spatial fix,]{.mark} allowing capital to transcend its
inherent terrestrial limitations. In this way, the ultimate spatial fix
is perhaps (outer) space itself.]{.underline}

#### Space increases capitalism and unsustainable growth 

**Jackson,** 20**21** (Tim, Professor of Sustainable Development and
Director of the Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity
(CUSP). "Billionaire space race: the ultimate symbol of capitalism's
flawed obsession with growth" The Conversation. July 20, 2021

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids, laments the Rocket Man
in Elton John's timeless classic. In fact, it's cold as hell. [But that
doesn't seem to worry a new generation of [space entrepreneurs intent on
colonising the "final frontier]{.mark}" as fast as
possible.]{.underline}

Don't get me wrong. I'm no sullen technophobe. As lockdown projects go,
Nasa's landing of the [Perseverance
rover](https://theconversation.com/as-the-perseverance-rover-lands-on-mars-theres-a-lot-we-already-know-about-the-red-planet-from-meteorites-found-on-earth-155459) on
the surface of the red planet earlier this year was a hell of a blast.
Watching it reminded me that I once led a high school debate defending
the motion: this house believes that humanity should reach for the
stars.

It must have been around the time that Caspar Weinberger was trying to
persuade President Nixon [not to
cancel](https://www.wired.com/2013/09/ending-apollo-1968/) the Apollo
space programme. My brothers and I had watched the monochrome triumph of
the [Apollo 11
landing](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/apollo11.html) avidly
in 1969. We'd witnessed the near disaster of [Apollo
13](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo13.html) --
immortalised in a 1995
Hollywood [film](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/17/apollo-13-tom-hanks-space-ron-howard) --
when Jim Lovell (played by Tom Hanks) and two rookie astronauts narrowly
escaped with their lives by using the Lunar Module as an emergency life
raft. We knew it was exciting up there.

I remember later going to see Apollo 13 (the film) with a friend who
wasn't born when the mission itself took place. "What did you think?" I
asked as we came out of the cinema. "It was OK," said my friend. "Just
not very believable."

But we kids were glued to our black-and-white TV sets the entire week of
the original mission. We watched in horror as CO₂ levels rose in the
Lunar Module. We endured the endless blackout as the returning
astronauts plunged perilously back to Earth. We held our breath with the
rest of the world as the expected four minutes stretched to five and
hope began to fade. It was a full six minutes before the camera finally
came into focus on the command module's parachutes -- safely deployed
above the Pacific Ocean. We felt the endorphin rush. We knew it was
believable.

That was 1970. This is now. And here I am again on the edge of another
sofa, in the lingering uncertainty of the time of COVID-19, waiting for
signs of arrival from another re-entry blackout on another barren rock,
devoid of breathable atmosphere, 200 million miles away. And when the
Perseverance Rover finally touches down on the surface of Mars: that
same exhilaration. That same endorphin rush. Quite difficult to witness
the jubilation behind the masks at Nasa's mission control without
feeling a glimmer of vicarious joy. Hope, even.

But Nasa's clever science experiment is just the tip of an expansionary
iceberg. A teaser, if you will, for an ambitious dream that is being
driven faster and faster by huge commercial interests. A curious twist
in a debate that has been raging now for almost half a century.

Growth wars

[Ever since 1972, when a team of MIT scientists published a massively
influential report on the [Limits to
Growth](https://www.clubofrome.org/publication/the-limits-to-growth/)[, [economists
have been
fighting](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6468/950) about
whether it's possible for the economy to expand forever]{.mark}. Those
who believe it can, appeal to the [power of
technology](https://andrewmcafee.org/more-from-less/overivew) to
"decouple" economic activity from its effects on the planet. Those (like
me) who believe it can't point to the [limited evidence for
decoupling](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332500379_Is_Green_Growth_Possible) at
anything like the pace that's needed to avoid a climate emergency or
prevent a catastrophic decline in biodiversity.]{.underline}

[[The growth debate often hangs on the power you attribute to technology
to save us.]{.mark} Usually it's the technophiles arguing for infinite
growth on a finite planet -- sometimes putting their hopes in
speculative technologies such as [direct air
capture](https://theconversation.com/new-co-capture-technology-is-not-the-magic-bullet-against-climate-change-115413) or
dangerous ones like nuclear power]{.underline}. And usually it's the
sceptics arguing for a [post-growth
economy](http://www.timjackson.org.uk/postgrowth). But the simple
division between technophiles and technophobes has never been
particularly helpful. Very few growth sceptics reject technology
completely. No one at all is asking humanity to return to the cave.

My own research teams at the University of Surrey have been [exploring
the vital role](https://www.cusp.ac.uk/team/team/t_jackson/) of
sustainable technology in transforming the economy for almost three
decades now. [But we've also shown how the [dynamics of capitalism -- in
particular its relentless pursuit of [productivity
growth](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/opinion/sunday/lets-be-less-productive.html) --
continually push society towards materialistic goals, and undermine
those parts of the economy such as [care, craft and
creativity](http://www.timjackson.org.uk/pwg), which are essential to
our quality of life.]{.mark}]{.underline}

And now suddenly, along comes a group of self-confessed technology
lovers finally admitting that the planet is too small for us. [Yes, you
were right, they imply: the [Earth cannot sustain infinite growth.
That's why we have to expand into space.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Wait. What just happened? Did somebody move the goalposts? Something is
wrong. Maybe it's me. One thing I know for sure. I'm no longer the same
kid I was -- the one from the debating society. This house believes that
humanity should grow the fuck up.

Before it spends [trillions of
dollars](https://www.sciencefocus.com/space/top-10-what-are-the-top-10-most-expensive-space-missions/) littering
its [techno-junk](https://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Space_Debris/The_cost_of_space_debris#:%7E:text=Space%20debris%20is%20expensive%2C%20and%20will%20become%20even%20more%20so&text=For%20satellites%20in%20geostationary%20orbit,higher%20than%205%E2%80%9310%25.) around
the solar system, this house believes that humanity should pay a little
more attention to what's happening right here and now. On this planet.

The human condition

Perhaps ironically, it was from space that we saw it first. In October
1957, the Soviets sent an unmanned orbital satellite
called [Sputnik](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_924.html) into
space. It was one of those odd moments in history (like the coronavirus)
that dramatically reshapes our social world. Sputnik kicked off the
space race, intensified the arms race and heightened the cold war. It
was a huge blow to US self-esteem not to be the first nation to reach
space and it was the jolt it used to kickstart the Apollo Moon shot. No
one likes coming second. Least of all the most powerful people on the
planet.

But Sputnik also signalled the beginning of a new relationship between
humanity and its earthly home. As the political philosopher [Hannah
Arendt](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arendt/) remarked in the
prologue to her 1958 masterpiece, [The Human
Condition](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Human_Condition/bGlwDwAAQBAJ),
going into space allowed us to grasp our planetary predicament for the
first time in history. It was a reminder that "the Earth is the
quintessence of the human condition". And nature itself, "for all we
know, may be unique in providing human beings with a habitat in which
they can move and breathe without effort and without artifice".

Fair point. And nothing we've learned in the intervening years has
changed that prognosis. Mars may be the most habitable planet in the
solar system, outside our own. But it's still a very far cry from the
beauty of home -- whose fragility we only truly learned to appreciate
fully from the images sent back to us from space.

Nature photographer Galen Rowell once called William Anders' iconic
photo [Earthrise](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/earthrise.html) --
taken from the Apollo 8 module in lunar orbit -- "the most influential
environmental photograph ever taken". Earthrise brought home to us, in
one astonishing image, the stark reality that this shining orb was --
and still is -- humanity's best chance for anything that might
meaningfully be called the "good life".

Its beauty is our beauty. Its fragility is our fragility. And its peril
is our peril.

An inconvenient truth

In the very same year that Arendt published The Human Condition, a Shell
executive named Charles Jones presented [a
paper](http://www.climatefiles.com/trade-group/american-petroleum-institute/1958-air-pollution-research-program-smoke-fumes/) to
the fossil fuel industry's trade group, the American Petroleum
Institute, warning of the impact of carbon emissions from fossil fuel
combustion on the atmosphere. It was early evidence of climate change.

It was also evidence, according to lawsuits [now being
filed](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2021/jun/30/climate-crimes-fossil-fuels-cities-states-interactive) by
cities and states in the US, that companies like Shell knew it was
happening more than 60 years ago -- three decades before James
Hansen's [scientific
testimony](https://grist.org/article/james-hansens-legacy-scientists-reflect-on-climate-change-in-1988-2018-and-2048/) to
Congress in 1988 brought global warming to public attention. And they
did nothing about it. Worse, argue plaintiffs like the [state of
Delaware](https://eu.delawareonline.com/story/news/2020/09/10/delaware-sues-exxon-chevron-and-bp-role-climate-change/3457202001/),
they lied over and again to cover up this "inconvenient truth".

Why such a thing could happen is now clear. Evidence of their impact was
a direct threat to the profits of some of the most powerful corporations
on the planet. Profit is the bedrock of capitalism. And as I argue
in [my new book](http://www.timjackson.org.uk/postgrowth), [we [have
allowed capitalism to trump everything: work, life, hope -- even good
governance]{.mark}.]{.underline} The most enlightened governments in the
world have turned a blind eye to the need for urgent action. Now we're
on the verge of being too late to fix it. Achieving net zero by 2050
is [no longer
enough](https://theconversation.com/2050-is-too-late-we-must-drastically-cut-emissions-much-sooner-121512).
We need much more, much faster to avoid ending up in an
unliveable [hothouse](https://theconversation.com/hothouse-earth-our-planet-has-been-here-before-heres-what-it-looked-like-101413).

Even as I write, [record-breaking
temperatures](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/us/west-heat-wave-death-valley.html),
10-20℃ above the seasonal average, have forced citizens on the west
coast of North America into [underground
shelters](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/07/01/portland-heatwave-like-microwave-hairdryer-blowing/) to
avoid the searing
heat. [Wildfires](https://news.sky.com/story/us-wildfires-firefighters-grapple-with-raging-blazes-as-temperatures-soar-to-54c-in-californias-baking-death-valley-12354197) are
raging in California's Death Valley, where temperatures have reached an
astonishing 54℃. On the storm-struck east coast, [flood
waters](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/09/new-york-city-storm-flooding-climate-change) have
inundated the New York subway system. Thousands remain homeless and
hundreds are still missing, meanwhile, as [historic
flooding](https://news.sky.com/story/germany-and-belgium-floods-rescuers-search-for-hundreds-of-missing-as-more-than-120-die-in-historic-disaster-12357532) across
central Europe has left almost 200 people dead.

In the face of the blindingly obvious, even recalcitrant presidents and
politicians are at last beginning to acknowledge the scale of the peril
in which our relentless pursuit of economic growth has placed the
planet. And in principle they still have time to do something about it.

As I and many colleagues have argued, the pandemic offers us a unique
opportunity to fashion [a different kind of
economy](https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/news-media/press-releases/economy-environment-and-peoples-well-being-must-go-hand-hand-post-covid-eu).
The 26th Conference of the Parties to the UN Climate Change Convention
([COP26](https://ukcop26.org/)) in Glasgow in November 2021 could well
be the place to do that. Whether that happens or not will depend as much
on vision as it does on science. And on our courage to confront the
inequalities of power that led us to this point.

It will also depend on us going back to first principles and asking
ourselves: how exactly should we aim to live in the only habitable world
in the known universe? What is the nature of the good life available to
us here? What can prosperity [possibly mean](http://www.cusp.ac.uk/) for
a promiscuous species on a finite planet?

The question is almost as old as the hills. But the contemporary answer
to it is paralysingly narrow. Cast in the garb of late capitalism,
prosperity has been captured by the ideology of "growth at all costs":
an insistence that more is always better. Despite [overwhelming
evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jq23mSDh9U) that relentless
expansion is undermining nature and driving us towards a devastating
climate emergency, the "[fairytales of eternal
growth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMrtLsQbaok)" still reign
supreme.

Shouldn't humanity focus on shoring up the good life on Earth before we
race off into space? [Tegan

Zero gravity

It's an ironic twist in the tale of the debate society kid I used to be
that I've spent most of my professional life confronting those
fairytales of growth. Don't ask me how that happened. By accident
mostly.

I toyed with the idea of studying astrophysics. But I ended up studying
Maths at Cambridge, where I confess to being baffled by the complexity
of it all, until I realised that even math is just a trick. Quite
literally a formula. Believe in it and you can travel to the stars and
back. In your mind, at least.

And there I was wandering around in zero G, when I woke up one day (in
April 1986) to find that the Number four reactor at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant in Ukraine had suffered a catastrophic meltdown. I
suddenly realised that the very same skills I'd spent my life developing
were leading humanity not towards the stars but away from the paradise
we already inhabit.

So yes. I changed my mind. The next day I walked into the Greenpeace
office in London and asked what I could do to help. They set me working
on the [economics of renewable
energy](https://www.elsevier.com/books/renewable-energy/jackson/978-1-4832-5695-5) I
became, accidentally, an economist. (Economics needs more accidental
economists.) And that's when it began to dawn on me that learning how to
live well on this fragile planet is far more important than dreaming
about the next one.

Mine is bigger than yours

[Not so the space race billionaires. A [handful of unbelievably powerful
men, whose wealth
has [exploded](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2021/04/30/american-billionaires-have-gotten-12-trillion-richer-during-the-pandemic/) massively
throughout the pandemic, are now busy trying to persuade us that the
future lies]{.mark} not here on Earth but out there [among the
stars.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Tesla founder and serial entrepreneur, Elon Musk is one of these new
rocket men. "Those who attack space,"
he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1414782972474048516) recently,
"maybe don't realise that space represents hope for so many people".
That may be true of course in a world where huge inequalities of wealth
and privilege strip hope from the lives of billions of people. But, as
the spouse of a Nasa flight controller pointed out, it obscures
the [extraordinary
demands](https://www.salon.com/2021/07/07/no-billionaires-wont-escape-to-space-while-the-world-burns/?fbclid=IwAR3Hzv3TGOuflDjlSatFJQN0_nastGp1MCqP-AOU0PJrUQWtHIMxNcP-BEM) of
escaping from Mother Earth, in terms of energy materials, people and
time.

Undeterred, the rocket men gaze starward. If resources are the problem,
then space must be the answer. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is pretty
explicit about his own expansionary vision. "We can have a trillion
humans in the solar system," [he once
declared](https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/jeff-bezos-foresees-trillion-people-living-millions-space-colonies-here-ncna1006036).
"Which means we'd have a thousand Mozarts and a thousand Einsteins. This
would be an incredible civilisation."

Bezos and Musk have spent their lockdown contesting the top two places
on the Forbes [rich list](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/). They've
also been playing "mine is bigger than yours" in their own private space
race for a couple of decades now. Bezos's personal wealth [almost
doubled](https://inequality.org/great-divide/updates-billionaire-pandemic/) during
the course of a pandemic that destroyed the lives and livelihoods of
millions. He's now stepping down to spend more time on Blue Origin, the
company he hopes will deliver vast human colonies across the solar
system.

The [declared aim](https://www.spacex.com/mission/) of Musk's rival
company, SpaceX, is "to make humanity multiplanetary". Just like [Kim
Stanley
Robinson](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/our-greatest-political-novelist)'s
science
fiction [trilogy](https://space.nss.org/book-review-red-mars/) back in
the 1990s, Musk aims to establish a [permanent human
colony](https://www.cnet.com/news/elon-musk-drops-details-for-spacexs-million-person-mars-mega-colony/) on
Mars. To get there, he reasons, we need very big rockets -- or, in the
original terminology of SpaceX, Big Fucking Rockets
([BFRs](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/19/18-new-details-about-elon-musks-redesigned-moon-bound-big-fing-rocket/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJd2kjzq4ZnY7YFIEcz1ZTmBPm7MmuQ_2wfNs9erxRMlo4qDio6p9lDkDY7I00A3KvMN5ZKZkkkxZB_ldqttJgYIGM2a4zE5NLSWLYRZMI11-1xbvn31Q6uJBOOn11q5oVbllHCYDhH3ygdBFbWUXOu2H2tXqDsVhtsvMKEe5s_w))
-- eventually capable of transporting scores of people and hundreds of
tonnes of equipment millions of miles across the solar system.

The BFRs have now given way to a series of (more sedately named)
Starships. And to prove his green credentials Musk desperately wants
these [starships](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/) to be
reusable. So much so that SpaceX conspired to blow up four consecutive
Starship prototypes in quick succession during the first four months of
2021 trying unsuccessfully to re-land them.

Move fast and break things is the Silicon Valley motto of course. But
eventually you've got to bring the goods home. [Starship
SN15](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/5/6/the-starship-has-landed-spacex-nails-reusable-craft-touchdown) finally

massive [US\$2.9
billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/science/spacex-moon-nasa.html) contract
from Nasa, nudging Blue Origin into the space race shadows.

Not wanting to be outdone, Bezos came up with what he must have hoped
was the ultimate comeback. When Blue Origin's [New
Shepard](https://www.blueorigin.com/new-shepard/) rocket -- which is
also reusable -- made its first manned space flight on July 20, he and
his brother Mark would be two of the first few passengers on board. Wow,
Jeff! Kudos man! Now you really show us your cojones! Nobody likes
coming second. Least of all the most powerful people on the planet.

But sometimes you get no choice. Out of the blue, without so much as a
by-your-leave, Virgin boss, Richard Branson swooped in to steal
everyone's thunder. On July 11, nine days before Bezos's big day,
Branson became the first ever billionaire to [launch himself into
space](https://theconversation.com/virgin-galactic-space-tourism-takes-off-with-bransons-inaugural-flight-164142).

And for a cool US\$250,000, he promised us, you too can be one of Virgin
Galactic's 600 or so breathless customers, waiting to enjoy three or
four weightless minutes gazing back in rapture at the planet you've left
behind. Apparently, Musk has [already signed
up](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573850/elon-musk-richard-branson-spaceplane-virgin-galactic).
Bezos doesn't need to. He's made his own [virgin space
flight](https://www.space.com/news/live/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-launch-updates) now.

Prosperity as health

[The space rhetoric of the super-rich betrays a mentality that may once
have served humanity well. Some would say it's a quintessential feature
of capitalism[. Innovation upon innovation. A driving ambition to expand
and explore. A primal urge to escape our origins and reach for the next
horizon. Space travel is a natural extension of our [obsession with
economic
growth](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/10/can-we-have-prosperity-without-growth).
It's the crowning jewel of capitalism.]{.mark} Further and faster is its
frontier creed.]{.underline}

I've spent much of my professional life as a critic of that creed, not
just for environmental reasons but on social grounds as well. The seven
years I spent as economics commissioner on the UK's [Sustainable
Development Commission](http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/) and my
subsequent research at the [Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable
Prosperity](http://www.cusp.ac.uk/) revealed something fundamental about
our aspirations for the good life. Something that has been underlined by
the experience of the pandemic.

Prosperity is as much about health as it is about wealth. Ask people
what matters most in their lives and the chances are that this will come
out somewhere near the top of the list. Health for themselves. Health
for their friends and their families. Health too -- sometimes -- for the
fragile planet on which we live and on whose health we ourselves depend.

There's something fascinating in this idea. Because it confronts the
obsession with growth head on. As Aristotle pointed out in [Nicomachean
Ethics](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.html) (a book
named after his physician father), the good life is not a relentless
search for more, but a continual process of finding a "virtuous" balance
between too little and too much.

Population health provides an obvious example of this idea. Too little
food and we're struggling with diseases of malnutrition. Too much and
we're tipped into the "diseases of affluence" that [now kill more
people](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight) than
under-nutrition does. Good health depends on us finding and nurturing
this balance.

This task is always tricky of course, even at the individual level. Just
think about the challenge of keeping your exercise, your diet and your
appetites in line with the outcome of a healthy body weight. But
as [I've argued](https://www.timjackson.org.uk/postgrowth), living
inside a system that has its sights continually focused on more makes
the task near impossible. Obesity has tripled since 1975. Almost
two-fifths of adults over 18 are overweight. [Capitalism not only fails
to recognise the point where balance lies. It has absolutely no idea how
to stop when it gets there.]{.underline}

You'd think our brush with mortality through the pandemic would have
brought some of this home to us. You'd think it would give us pause for
thought about what really matters to us: the kind of world we want for
our children; the kind of society we want to live in. And for many
people it has. In a survey carried out during lockdown in the UK, [85%
of
respondents](https://www.thersa.org/press/releases/2019/brits-see-cleaner-air-stronger-social-bonds-and-changing-food-habits-amid-lockdown) found
something in their changed conditions they felt worth keeping and fewer
than 10% wanted a complete return to normal.

When life and health are at stake, the ungodly scramble for wealth and
status feels less and less attractive. Even the lure of technology
pales. Family, conviviality and a sense of purpose come to the fore.
These are the things that many people found they lacked most throughout
the pandemic. But their importance in our lives was not a COVID
accident: they are the most fundamental elements of a sustainable
prosperity.

The denial of death

Something even more surprising
has [emerged](https://timjackson.org.uk/consumerism-theodicy/) during my
three decades of research. Behind consumer capitalism, behind the
frontier mentality, beyond the urge to expand forever lies a deep-seated
and pervasive anxiety.

What does day two look like, Bezos once [asked a
crowd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTwXS2H_iJo&ab_channel=AmazonNews) of
the faithful, referring to his famous maxim about the need to innovate.
"Day two is stasis, followed by irrelevance, followed by excruciatingly
painful decline, followed by death," he said. "And that. Is why. It is
always. Day one!" His audience loved it.

Musk plays out his own inner demons just as disarmingly. "I'm not trying
to be anyone's saviour," [he once
told](https://www.ted.com/talks/elon_musk_the_future_we_re_building_and_boring/transcript?language=en) TED's
head curator, Chris Anderton. "I'm just trying to think about the future
-- and not be sad." Again, the applause was deafening.

A well-trained therapist could have a field day with all of this. Take
that miraculous day a few weeks after the Perseverance rover started
sending home the most amazing selfies in the universe, when the
Ingenuity helicopter made its [virgin
flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQMTo0KuN5M) in the wafer thin
atmosphere of Mars. It was the kind of outcome that could have
intelligence agencies drooling over far less benign uses of the
technology. But there was also something pretty existential going on.

The faint whispering of the Martian wind, relayed faithfully across the
solar system, doesn't just confirm the possibilities for aerial flight
on an alien planet. It's grist to the mill of an essential belief that
human beings are endlessly creative and fiendishly clever.

Our visceral response to these momentary triumphs speaks to a branch of
psychology called [terror management
theory](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/terror-management-theory) drawn
from the work of cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker. It was explored
in particular in his astonishing 1973 book [The Denial of
Death](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Denial_of_Death/jyqGDwAAQBAJ).
In it, Becker argues that modern society has lost its way, precisely
because we've become terrified of confronting the inevitability of our
own demise.

Terror management theory tells us that, when mortality becomes
"salient", instead of addressing the underlying fear, we turn for
comfort to the things which make us feel good. Capitalism itself is a
massive comfort blanket, designed to help us never confront the
mortality that awaits us all. So too are the dreams of the rocket men.

Beyond lockdown

When Sputnik kickstarted the first "space race" six decades ago, a US
newspaper headline called it "one step toward \[our\] escape from
imprisonment to the Earth". Arendt read those words with astonishment.
She saw there a deep-seated "[rebellion against human
existence](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Human_Condition/bGlwDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=hannah%20arendt%20%27rebellion%20against%20human%20existence%27&pg=PA2&printsec=frontcover&bsq=hannah%20arendt%20%27rebellion%20against%20human%20existence%27)".
It isn't just the pandemic that locks us down, the implication is. It's
the entire human condition.

The anxiety we feel is nothing new. The choice between confronting our
fears and running away from them has always been a profound one. It's
exactly the choice we're facing now. As vaccine roll-out brings a
glimmer of light at the end of COVID-19, the temptation to rush into
wild escapism is massive.

But for all its glamour, the "final frontier" is at best an amusement
and at worst a fatal distraction from the urgent task of rebuilding a
society ravaged by social injustice, climate change and a loss of faith
in the future.

With most of us still reeling from what the World Health Organisation
has called a [shadow
pandemic](https://theconversation.com/domestic-abuse-and-mental-ill-health-twin-shadow-pandemics-stalk-the-second-wave-148412) in
mental health, any kind of escape plan at all looks remarkably like
paradise. And emigrating to Mars is one hell of an escape plan.

Let's dream of some "final frontier" by all means. But let's focus our
minds too on some quintessentially earthly priorities. Affordable
healthcare. Decent homes for the poorest in society. A solid education
for our kids. Reversing the decades-long precarity in the livelihoods of
the frontline workers -- the ones who saved our lives. Regenerating the
devastating loss of the natural world. Replacing a frenetic consumerism
with an economy of care and relationship and meaning.

Never have these things made so much sense to so many. Never has there
been a better time to turn them into a reality. Not just for the handful
of billionaires dreaming of unbridled wealth on the red planet, but for
the eight billion mere mortals living out their far less brazen dreams
on the blue one.

#### Space is a demonstration of capitalist power 

**Marx**, 20**20** (Paris, author and host of *Tech Won't Save Us*
podcast. "Yes to Space Exploration. No to Space Capitalism" June 8,
2020.
[https://jacobin.com/2020/06/spacex-elon-musk-jeff-bezos-capitalism
///](https://jacobin.com/2020/06/spacex-elon-musk-jeff-bezos-capitalism%20///)MF)

[Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk have a [vision of space that serves the narrow
interests of capitalists]{.mark}.]{.underline} But we don't want to be
indentured servants on a Martian colony --- we want solar exploration
that benefits humanity as a whole.

On May 30, SpaceX finally launched astronauts into space more than two
years behind schedule. President Donald Trump was on hand for the
launch. After pushing for [the militarization of
space](https://theconversation.com/donald-trumps-space-force-the-dangerous-militarisation-of-outer-space-98588) with
the formation of the US Space Force, Trump fused his own vision with
that of SpaceX founder Elon Musk, declaring, "We'll soon be landing on
Mars and we'll soon have the greatest weapons ever imagined in history."

Early in Trump's presidency, Musk faced criticism for being part of the
administration's advisory council and [refusing to step
down](https://www.vox.com/2017/2/4/14508874/elon-musk-trump-business-council-twitter-tesla-spacex) even
as Trump signed his signature Muslim ban. It was believed Musk was
hoping to benefit from greater public subsidies, on top of the billions
NASA gave to SpaceX, and he's set to do so as part of [Trump's plan to
get astronauts back on the moon by
2024](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/11/nasa-space-budget-billions-to-spacex-blue-origin-maxar-and-more.html).
More recently, the two have found themselves of the same mind on the
pandemic as they shared misleading health information and Musk echoed
Trump's calls to "open the economy" and give people their
"[freedom](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-give-people-their-freedom-back-and-reopen-america-2020-04-29)"
back.

The May 30 launch symbolized both Trump's desire to project an image of
revived American greatness and Musk's need not only to bolster the myth
that makes his wealth possible, but to set the foundations for a
privatized space industry.

The space billionaires --- Musk and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos foremost among
them --- have little stake in the well-being of the majority of the
population. Their space visions are designed for wealthy people like
themselves, with little mention of where the working class would fit in.
They've built their wealth on exploitation, and their visions of the
future are little more than an extension of their present actions.

A History of Violence

The business practices of Musk and Bezos are increasingly well known and
have been on clear display during the pandemic. Musk tried to claim
Tesla's Fremont, California factory was "essential" until [authorities
forced him to close
it;](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Tesla-s-Fremont-factory-ordered-to-shut-down-15137774.php) then
he [reopened it in defiance of health
orders](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/5/12/21255812/elon-musk-tesla-factory-coronavirus-reopening).
As Tesla CEO, Musk has a long history of [opposing the unionization of
workers](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/10/tesla-workers-union-elon-musk),
presiding over a high rate of worker injuries ([which the company tried
to cover
up](https://www.revealnews.org/article/tesla-says-its-factory-is-safer-but-it-left-injuries-off-the-books/)),
and even having a former worker [hacked and
harassed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-03-13/when-elon-musk-tried-to-destroy-tesla-whistleblower-martin-tripp) after
he became a whistleblower.

Meanwhile, Bezos has a similar history of abusing Amazon workers.
Amazon's warehouses are known for having [higher injury rates than the
industry
average](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/11/amazon-warehouse-reports-show-worker-injuries/602530/),
the company has [fought
unionization](https://gizmodo.com/amazons-aggressive-anti-union-tactics-revealed-in-leake-1829305201),
and the stories of
the [terrible](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-warehouse-2011-9) [conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/05/amazon-workers-protest-unsafe-grueling-conditions-warehouse) [experienced](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/amazon-protests-workers-urinate-plastic-bottles-no-toilet-breaks-milton-keynes-jeff-bezos-a9012351.html) [by](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516004/amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-centers-productivity-firing-terminations) [workers](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-warehouse-workers-share-their-horror-stories-2018-4) are
legendary. During the pandemic, that has continued, with the company
failing to enforce social distancing or provide adequate protective
equipment [until workers began walking
out](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/30/amazon-workers-strike-coronavirus),
refusing to be [open about infection
information](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-05-28/amazon-whole-foods-workers-track-coronavirus-cases),
and firing workers who
dared [criticize](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/amazon-chris-smalls-smart-articulate-leaked-memo) [the](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220353/amazon-covid-19-criticism-protest-fired-employees-cunningham-costa-climate-change) [company](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/y3zd9g/whole-foods-just-fired-an-employee-who-kept-track-of-coronavirus-cases),
all while Bezos's wealth has increased by [more than \$30
billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/american-billionaires-got-434-billion-richer-during-the-pandemic.html).

But it goes beyond that, because the worldviews of these billionaires
began to be formed long before they started the empires they currently
lord over.

Musk did not have a regular childhood, but rather a wealthy upbringing
in apartheid South Africa. His father was an engineer and owned part of
an emerald mine in Zambia, telling [Business
Insider](https://theconversation.com/donald-trumps-space-force-the-dangerous-militarisation-of-outer-space-98588),
"We were very wealthy. We had so much money at times we couldn't even
close our safe." In Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a
Fantastic Future, Ashlee Vance describes how Musk got money from his
father when he was starting one of his original ventures. He also had a
particular admiration for his grandfather, who moved to apartheid South
Africa from Canada after rallying "against government interference in
the lives of individuals."

Bezos has a not dissimilar story. His father was a well-off oil engineer
in Cuba while Fulgencio Batista was in power. In Bit Tyrants, Rob Larson
explains that Bezos's father left the island after the Cuban Revolution
and passed his libertarian views down to his son. Bezos's
parents [invested nearly
\$250,000](https://money.com/amazon-jeff-bezoss-parents-investments/) in
Amazon in 1995 as it was getting started.

[These [space barons made their billions through the exploitation of
their workers and came from well-off backgrounds made possible from
resource extraction.]{.mark} When digging into their visions for a
future in space, it's clear that they seek to extend these conditions
into the cosmos, not challenge them in favor of space exploration for
the benefit of all.]{.underline}

The Future They Want

[Musk and Bezos are the leading drivers of the modern push to privatize
and colonize space through their respective companies, SpaceX and Blue
Origin. Their visions differ slightly, with Musk preferring to colonize
Mars, while Bezos has more interest in building space colonies in
orbit.]{.underline}

In 2016, Musk claimed he would [begin sending rockets to Mars in
2018](https://observer.com/2016/06/elon-musk-charts-path-to-colonizing-mars-within-a-decade/).
That never happened, but it hasn't ended his obsession. Musk is
determined to make humans a multi-planetary species, framing our choice
as either space colonization or the risk of extinction. Bezos says that
Earth is the best planet in our solar system, but if we don't colonize
space we doom ourselves to "[stasis and
rationing](https://jacobinmag.com/2019/07/space-colonies-jeff-bezos-blue-origin)."

[These framings serve the interests of these billionaires, and make it
seem like colonizing space is an obvious and necessary choice when it
isn't. It ignores their personal culpability and the [role of the
capitalist system they seek to reproduce in causing the problems they
say we need to flee in the first place.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Billionaires have a [much greater carbon
footprint](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/12/1/16718844/green-consumers-climate-change) than
ordinary people, with Musk [flying his private
jet](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/01/elon-musk-private-jet-flew-150000-miles-in-2018-washington-post-reports/) all
around the world as he claims to be an environmental champion. Amazon,
meanwhile, is [courting oil and gas
companies](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-is-aggressively-pursuing-big-oil-as-it-stalls-ou-1833875828) with
cloud services to make their business more efficient, and Tesla is
selling [a false vision of
sustainability](https://jacobinmag.com/2020/01/elon-musk-climate-apocalypse-tesla-spacex) that
purposely serves people like Musk, [[all while capitalism continues to
drive the climate system toward the cliff edge. Colonizing space will
not save us from billionaire-fueled climate
dystopia.]{.underline}]{.mark}

But these billionaires do not hide who would be served by their futures.
Musk has given many figures for the cost of a ticket to Mars, but
they're never cheap. He told Vance the tickets would cost \$500,000 to
\$1 million, a price at which he thinks "it's highly likely that there
will be a self-sustaining Martian colony." However, the workers for such
a colony clearly won't be able to buy their own way. Rather, Musk
tweeted a plan for [Martian indentured
servitude](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-a-new-life-awaits-you-on-the-off-world-colon-1841071257) where
workers would take on loans to pay for their tickets and pay them off
later because "There will be a lot of jobs on Mars!"

Bezos is even more open about how the workforce will have to expand to
serve his vision, but has little to say about what they'll be doing.
[His plan to maintain economic "growth and dynamism" requires the human
population to [grow to a trillion
people](https://jacobinmag.com/2019/07/space-colonies-jeff-bezos-blue-origin)]{.underline}.
He claims this would create "a thousand Mozarts and a thousand
Einsteins" who would live in space colonies that are supposed to house a
million people each, with the surface of Earth being mainly for tourism.
Meanwhile, industrial and mining work would move into orbit so as not to
pollute the planet, and while he doesn't explicitly acknowledge it, it's
likely [that's where you'll find many of those trillion
workers](https://jacobinmag.com/2019/12/jeff-bezos-the-expanse-space-fantasy-sci-fi-syfy/) toiling
for their space overlord and his descendants.

[[Space Shouldn't Serve Capitalists]{.underline}]{.mark}

In 1978, Murray Bookchin [skewered a certain brand of
futurism](http://unevenearth.org/2019/10/bookchin_doing_the_impossible/) that
sought to "extend the present into the future" and desired
"multinational corporations to become multi-cosmic corporations." Much
of this future thinking obsesses about possible changes to technology,
but seeks to preserve the existing social and economic relations ---
"the present as it exists today, projected, one hundred years from now,"
as Bookchin put it. That's at the core of the space billionaires' vision
for the future.

[Space has been used by past US presidents to bolster American power and
influence, but [it was largely accepted that capitalism ended at the
edge of the atmosphere. That's no longer the case, and just as past
capitalist expansions have come at the expense of poor and working
people to enrich a small elite]{.mark}, so too will this one. Bezos and
Trump may have a public feud, but that doesn't mean that their mutual
interest isn't served by a renewed US push into space that funnels
massive public funds into private pockets and seeks to open celestial
bodies to capitalist resource extraction.]{.underline}

[This is not to say that we need to halt space exploration. [The
collective interest of humanity is served by learning more about the
solar system and the universe beyond, but the goal of such missions must
be driven by gaining scientific knowledge and enhancing global
cooperation, not nationalism and profit-making.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Yet that's exactly what the space billionaires and American
authoritarians have found common cause in, with Trump declaring that "[a
new age of American ambition has now
begun](https://twitter.com/TeamTrump/status/1266846741787074560?s=20)"
at a NASA press briefing just hours before cities across the country
were placed under curfew last week. Before space can be explored in a
way that benefits all of humankind, existing social relations must be
transformed, not extended into the stars as part of a new colonial
project.

#### Under capitalist society space expansion is unsustainable-only in a socialist system can we expand towards stars

In a relatively short period of time, what seemed something only found
in science fiction novels became reality. **[[Humanity has left
footprints on the moon]{.underline}]{.mark}**, has satellites orbiting
nearly every planet in the solar system, has a rover on Mars, and very
recently the European Space Agency put a lander on the surface of a
comet. However, **[[as the capitalist crisis unfolds, it seems we will
have to abandon]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[hopeful plans for the
exploration of space and [the further development
of]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[technologies associated with
it.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The astronomer Fred Hoyle once said, "once a photograph of the Earth,
taken from the outside, is available . . . a new idea as powerful as any
will be let loose." Astronauts and cosmonauts who have had the
opportunity to view the Earth from space have all experienced something
called the "overview effect." Viewing the Earth for the first time from
the outside reveals how fragile our "pale blue dot" is. It is the only
planet we have yet discovered capable of sustaining human life. It has
just the right amount of water, it is just the right distance from our
Sun, and it has an atmosphere to protect us from the hostility of space.
Inherent in the \"overview effect\" is a sense of
internationalism---after all, when viewed from above, the Earth has no
visible borders.

The **[[Earth]{.underline}]{.mark}** has been described **[[as being our
one space ship]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with only one crew. And
**[[unless we overthrow the capitalist system]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[our spaceship is [in jeopardy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Capitalism
threatens the environment through pollution and unplanned usage of
natural resources]{.underline}**. It threatens human culture through the
destruction of public education and cuts in funding for the arts and
sciences, not to mention the destruction caused by wars and the
shuttering of the means of production .

The Marxist James Connolly, speaking of the starry plow banner of the
Irish Citizen Army, said that its significance was that a free,
socialist Ireland would control its own destiny from the plow to the
stars. **[[Only international socialism]{.mark}, free from the
constraints of capitalism and private ownership of the means of
production]{.underline}**, with universal, quality education for every
human on the planet, and free exchange of all technology and
research**[, [can usher in a new age]{.mark} in which humanity can look
to conquer]{.underline}** our own destiny, **[from the Earth to the
stars.]{.underline}**

aspirations]{.underline}** for the good life. Something that has been
underlined by the experience of the pandemic.

**[[Prosperity is as much about health as it is about
wealth]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Ask people what matters most in their
lives and the chances are that this will come out somewhere near the top

In 1978, **[Murray Bookchin]{.underline}** [skewered a certain brand of

**[sought to "extend the present into the future" and desired
"multinational corporations to become multi-cosmic
corporations.]{.underline}**" Much of this **[future thinking obsesses
about [possible changes to technology but seeks to preserve the existing
social and economic relations]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- "the present as
it exists today, projected, one hundred years from now," as Bookchin put
it. **[That's at the [core of the space billionaires' vision for the
future]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[[Space has been used by past
US presidents to bolster American power and influence]{.mark}, but it
was largely accepted that capitalism ended at the edge of the
atmosphere. That's no longer the case]{.underline}**, and just as past
[**[capitalist expansions have come at the expense of poor and working
people to enrich a small elite, so too will this

that doesn't mean that their mutual interest isn't served by a
**[renewed [US push into space]{.mark} that [funnels massive public
funds into private pockets and seeks to open celestial bodies to
capitalist resource extraction]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[This is not
to say that we need to halt space exploration.]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[The collective interest of humanity is served by learning more about
the solar system and the universe beyond, but the goal of such missions
must be driven by gaining scientific knowledge and enhancing global
cooperation, not [nationalism and profit-making. Yet that's exactly what
the space billionaires and American authoritarians have found common
cause in]{.mark}, with Trump declaring that "[a new age of American
ambition has now
begun](https://twitter.com/TeamTrump/status/1266846741787074560?s=20)"
at a NASA press briefing just hours before cities across the country
were placed under curfew last week. [Before space can be explored in a
way that benefits all of humankind, existing social relations must be
transformed]{.mark}]{.underline}**, not extended into the stars as part
of a new colonial project.

Strategic Ambiguity: How Much is too Much?

**[Overall]{.underline}**, **[the [Brussels]{.mark}
Communiqué]{.underline}** **[[send]{.mark}s a [strong
signal]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[that]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
**[[Allies]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[are [prepared to defend]{.mark}
their interests]{.underline}** in space, **[including [through]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** **[use of [force]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[if
necessary]{.underline}**. **[However]{.underline}**, **[the
[clarity]{.mark} of this message]{.underline}** [**[is
diluted]{.underline}** **[by]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the
[uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[surrounding]{.mark} the exact
[conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[which]{.underline}**]{.mark} may
**[[prompt]{.mark} the [Allies]{.mark} to invoke]{.underline}**
**[Article 5]{.underline}** in response to an armed attack. **[This
[ambiguity]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[may be]{.underline}** seen as **[an
asset]{.underline}**: **[leaving]{.underline}** hostile **[powers
guessing the exact conditions]{.underline}** **[that could trigger a
forceful military response]{.underline}** **[by the
Alliance]{.underline}** **[may prompt]{.underline}** those
**[powers]{.underline}** **[to proceed]{.underline}**
**[with]{.underline}** greater **[caution]{.underline}**.25

Strategic ambiguity thus has its benefits. **[However]{.underline}**,
**[hostile]{.underline}** **[actors]{.underline}** may **[also [read it
as a lack of resolve]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the present case, at
least two factors may encourage such a reading. The first relates to the
**[[uncertain parameters]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[of]{.underline}** the
**[right of self-defense]{.underline}** **[itself]{.underline}**
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[ambiguities that surround]{.mark}
its application]{.underline}** **[in space]{.underline}**.26 For
example, **[could]{.underline}** **[[non-kinetic]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[interference]{.underline}]{.mark}** against space-based assets or
services, such as signal jamming, **[rise to the level of an
armed]{.underline}** **[attack]{.underline}**? If so, under what
circumstances does such interference satisfy the gravity threshold
required to constitute an armed attack?27 Is it lawful to declare a
space exclusion zone or to deploy "bodyguard" satellites to defend
critical space-based assets in anticipation of an attack in the exercise
of the right of self-defense? Having recognized the applicability of
Article 5 to space attacks, [**[NATO nations]{.underline}**
**[need]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to develop a [shared
approach]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[to these and]{.underline}**
**[related questions]{.underline}** **[in order [to
demonstrate]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[unity and
resolve]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

The second factor relates to the geographical limits that Article 6 of
the NAT imposes on the operation of Article 5 of the NAT. The first
sub-paragraph of Article 6 deals with attacks on Allied territory. It is
clear from the language of this sub-paragraph that armed attacks
launched into the territory or islands of NATO members from or through
space fall squarely within the ambit of Article 5. Armed attacks
launched against their assets in space are caught by the second
sub-paragraph of Article 6, which deals with attacks against the
"forces, vessels or aircraft of any of the Parties." While neither the
notion of a vessel,28 nor that of an aircraft, 29 extends to objects
primarily designed for operation in outer space, the concept of 'forces'
is broad enough to cover spacecraft and their personnel. There is a
catch, however. **[The second sub-paragraph]{.underline}** **[of Article
6]{.underline}** of the NAT **[refers to attacks]{.underline}**
**[taking place "in or over"]{.underline}** **[Allied
territories]{.underline}**. **[This]{.underline}** **[means
that]{.underline}**, at best, **[attacks]{.underline}** **[against
Allied forces]{.underline}** in space **[are covered by Article
5]{.underline}** **[only]{.underline}** **[whilst in orbit
"over"]{.underline}** such **[territories]{.underline}** and above their
airspace. Accordingly, the destruction of an Allied satellite may engage
Article 5 if the satellite was orbiting over the territory of a NATO
nation, but not if it was orbiting over the South China Sea, for
instance.30

**[NATO [nations]{.mark}]{.underline}** thus **[[face a
dilemma]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}**
geographical **[[limitations imposed by]{.mark}
[A]{.mark}rticle]{.underline}** **[[6]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the NAT
**[on the operation]{.underline}** **[of their]{.underline}** mutual
**[assistance commitment]{.underline}**
**[[increases]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[the
[vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[of their space
assets]{.underline}** [**[to hostile maneuvers]{.underline}**
**[by]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[potential]{.underline}**
**[[adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially in the Southern
Hemisphere where the Alliance has the fewest Space Surveillance Network
(SSN) assets. **[To address this vulnerability]{.underline}**, the
**[Allies]{.underline}** **[may]{.underline}** consider Article 5 to be
applicable to attacks against their space assets wherever they may
operate, that is without any geographical restrictions. However[,
**[extend]{.underline}**ing the **[scope of Article
5]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to cover all]{.underline}** **[around
Earth]{.underline}** **[may [expose]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[NATO to
[accusations]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[that it seeks to]{.mark}
[militarize]{.mark}]{.underline}** this domain. Also, **[such a move
would [lack credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[unless it is
underwritten by capabilities]{.underline}** **[necessary]{.underline}**
[**[to defend]{.underline}** Western **[space
assets]{.underline}**]{.mark} and the services they provide.

**[[Ignoring]{.underline}]{.mark}** the matter **[is [not an
option]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[China and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** are **[known for
[exploit]{.mark}ing]{.underline}** **[legal]{.underline}** [**["grey
zone"]{.underline}** **[situations]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[by
conducting]{.underline}** **[hostile]{.underline}**
**[operations]{.underline}** **[below]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** traditional **[threshold of physical
violence]{.underline}** **[amounting]{.underline}** **[to an armed
attack]{.underline}**.31 They are **[[likely to
test]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[NATO]{.mark}'s]{.underline}** legal
**[readiness]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** political
**[[resolve]{.mark} in the space]{.underline}**
**[domain]{.underline}**, for example, **[[by using blind spots]{.mark}
to undertake]{.underline}** **[nefarious activities]{.underline}**
**[such]{.underline}** as co-orbital **[jamming]{.underline}** or RPOs.
**[Strategic [ambiguity]{.mark}]{.underline}** on the geographical scope
of application of Article 5 is **[[likely to invite, rather than
deter]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such **[hostile
[probing]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[While the U.S]{.underline}**. **[would like to]{.underline}**
**[prevent conflict]{.underline}** **[from escalating]{.underline}** to
space, **[many of our adversaries do not]{.underline}** share this goal.
Instead, **[they see]{.underline}** **[developing]{.underline}** and
fielding **[capabilities to hold our systems]{.underline}** on orbit at
risk **[as an opportunity to gain]{.underline}** decisive
**[advantages]{.underline}**. [**[Our]{.underline}** space **[enterprise
is the super glue that empowers]{.underline}** a **[broad]{.underline}**
range of **[military functions]{.underline}**. **[It is exceedingly
difficult to project]{.underline}** modern **[American]{.underline}**
combat **[power]{.underline}** **[without]{.underline}** **[a range of
crucial, space-based systems]{.underline}**.]{.mark} This includes our
communication, weather, intelligence, navigation and missile-warning
satellites. It may **[even be impossible for us to
project]{.underline}** effective combat **[power]{.underline}** **[if we
lose]{.underline}** our **[space-based capabilities]{.underline}**, and
our adversaries retain theirs. Our adversaries know this, and it is
exactly why they have pressed so hard to hold our satellites at risk by
demonstrating and fielding known terrestrial and, likely, space-based
anti-satellite weapons.

**[Given this]{.underline}** reality, **[it is important
to]{.underline}** present our leaders with a broad range of options that
will **[deter adversaries]{.underline}** **[from
attacking]{.underline}** U.S. **[space-based assets]{.underline}**. We
must convince our adversaries they cannot destroy our critical
satellites, while retaining theirs. Several of our opponents are equally
dependent on their constellations. A nightmare scenario for the U.S.
would see us send our terrestrial forces into combat without the support
of our space capabilities, while our enemy retains all of theirs. A far
better outcome would see us deter hostile actions in space altogether
through holding their assets similarly at risk, thereby empowering
deterrence. Should an opponent miscalculate, and deterrence fails, it is
crucial our leaders have options, including direct-ascent,
anti-satellite missiles, to level the playing field.

This is why **[the administration's]{.underline}** admirable
**[announcement to unilaterally ban]{.underline}** **[the testing
of]{.underline}** direct-ascent,
**[a]{.underline}**nti-**[sat]{.underline}**ellite
missile**[s]{.underline}** **[must not constrain]{.underline}** **[the
development]{.underline}** and fielding **[of]{.underline}** U.S.
offensive **[space capabilities]{.underline}**. **[This approach mirrors
the policies]{.underline}** and posture **[of our nuclear]{.underline}**
deterrent **[forces]{.underline}**: Our voluntary compliance with the
nuclear test ban treaty does not impede our fielding of a credible triad
to deter adversarial strategic attacks on the U.S. or our allies. We
understand these realities here on Earth, and we must ensure we apply
the same calculus to space. It is why the nuclear triad was so important
to check the Soviet Union in the Cold War, and why it remains essential
today. We did not invest in nuclear weapons because we wanted to launch
them. Quite the contrary: It was so we would never have to employ them
or be subject to them.

"**[[Using" our strategic deterrent]{.underline}]{.mark}** force
**[[means developing the enterprise]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[fielding]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}** various **[components
and ensuring]{.underline}** **[our adversaries understand]{.underline}**
**[the credibility]{.underline}** **[of our commitment]{.underline}**.
The same will hold true for keeping the peace in space. However, **[for
a set of capabilities]{.underline}** **[to be persuasive]{.underline}**,
**[we]{.underline}** **[must ensure our commitment]{.underline}** to use
**[is credible]{.underline}**. **[This means we must]{.underline}**
**[speak]{.underline}** **[with care]{.underline}** **[and ensure our
actions]{.underline}** **[reflect our resolve]{.underline}**.

**[S]{.underline}**tates would **[face a type of "Sophie's
Choice]{.underline}**": **[decline to intervene]{.underline}**,
**[potentially leading allies to follow suit and Taiwan]{.underline}**
**[to succumb]{.underline}** **[without a fight]{.underline}**, thereby
enabling Xi to achieve his goal of "peacefully" snuffing out Taiwanese
independence; **[or start a war]{.underline}** **[that
would]{.underline}** at best be long and bloody and might well even
**[cross the nuclear threshold]{.underline}**.

This emerging crisis has been three decades in the making. In 1991,
China watched from afar as the United States used space-enabled
capabilities to obliterate the Iraqi military from a distance in the
first Gulf War. The People's Liberation Army quickly set to work
developing capabilities targeted at a perceived Achilles' heel of this
new American way of war: reliance on vulnerable space systems.

This project came to fruition with a direct ascent ASAT weapons test in
2007, but the test was limited in two key respects. First, it only
reached low Earth orbit. Second, it generated thousands of pieces of
long-lasting space junk, provoking immense international ire. This
backlash appears to have taken China by surprise, driving it to seek
new, more usable ASAT types with minimal debris production. Now, **[one
such ASAT is nearing operational]{.underline}**
**[status]{.underline}**: **[spacecraft capable]{.underline}** **[of
rendezvous]{.underline}** and proximity **[operations]{.underline}**
(RPOs).

**[Such spacecraft]{.underline}** **[are inevitable]{.underline}**
**[and cannot realistically]{.underline}** **[be limited]{.underline}**.
[The United States, European Union, China, and others are developing
them to provide a range of satellite services essential to the new space
economy, such as in situ repairs and refueling of satellites and active
removal of space debris]{.mark}. But **[RPO capabilities are
dual-use]{.underline}**: **[if a satellite can]{.underline}**
**[grapple]{.underline}** space **[objects]{.underline}** **[for
servicing]{.underline}**, **[then it might well]{.underline}** **[be
capable of grappling an adversary's]{.underline}**
**[satellite]{.underline}** **[to move it out of its]{.underline}**
servicing **[orbit]{.underline}**. Perhaps **[it could
degrade]{.underline}** **[or]{.underline}** **[~~disable~~ it by
bending]{.underline}** **[or disconnecting]{.underline}** **[its solar
panels]{.underline}** and antennas all while producing minimal debris.

This is a serious threat, primarily because no international rules
presently exist to limit close approaches in space. Left unaddressed,
this lacuna in international law and space policy could enable a
prospective attacker to pre-position, during peacetime, as many
spacecraft as they wish as close as they wish to as many high-value
targets as they wish. The result would be an ever-present possibility of
sudden, bolt-from-the-blue attacks on vital space assets---and worse, on
many of them at once.

China has conducted at least half a dozen tests of RPO capabilities in
space since 2008, two of which went on for years. Influential space
experts have noted that these tests have plausible peaceful purposes and
are in many cases similar to those conducted by the United States. This,
however, does not make it any less important to establish effective
legal, policy, and technical counters to their offensive use. Even if it
were certain that these capabilities are intended purely for peaceful
applications---and it is not at all clear that that is the case---China
(or any other country) could at any time decide to repurpose these
capabilities for ASAT use.

There is still time to get out ahead of this threat, but likely not for
much longer. China's RPO capabilities have, thus far, lagged about five
years behind those of the United States. There are reasons to believe
this gap may close, but even assuming that it holds, we should expect to
see China demonstrate an operational dual-use rendezvous spacecraft by
around 2025. (The first instance of a U.S. commercial satellite docking
with another satellite to change its orbit occurred in February 2020.)

At the same time, China is expanding its capacity for rapid spacecraft
manufacturing. The Global Times reported in January that China's first
intelligent mass production line is set to produce 240 small satellites
per year. In April, Andrew Jones at SpaceNews reported that China is
developing plans to quickly produce and loft a thirteen
thousand-satellite national internet megaconstellation. It is not
unreasonable to assume that China could manufacture two hundred small
rendezvous ASAT spacecraft by 2029, possibly more.

**[If this happens]{.underline}**, **[and Beijing was to
decide]{.underline}** in 2029 **[to launch]{.underline}**
**[these]{.underline}** two hundred small **[RPO
spacecraft]{.underline}** and position them in close proximity to
strategically vital assets, **[then China]{.underline}** **[would be
able to]{.underline}** **[simultaneously threaten]{.underline}**
**[disablement of]{.underline}** the **[entire
constellations]{.underline}** **[of U.S. satellites]{.underline}**
**[for]{.underline}** **[m]{.underline}**issile **[e]{.underline}**arly
**[w]{.underline}**arning (**[about a dozen satellites]{.underline}**
with spares included); **[communications in a
nuclear-disrupted]{.underline}** **[environment]{.underline}** (about a
dozen); **[and positioning]{.underline}**, **[navigation]{.underline}**,
**[and timing]{.underline}** (about three dozen); **[along with several
dozen]{.underline}** **[key communications]{.underline}**,
**[imagery]{.underline}**, **[and meteorology satellites]{.underline}**.
[**[Losing these assets]{.underline}** would **[severely degrade U.S.
deterrence]{.underline}** **[and warfighting
capabilities]{.underline}**]{.mark}, yet **[once close
pre-positioning]{.underline}** **[has occurred]{.underline}** such
**[losses become almost impossible to prevent]{.underline}**. For this
reason, **[such pre-positioning could]{.underline}** conceivably
**[deter the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[from coming to Taiwan's aid due to the
prospect]{.underline}** **[that intervention]{.underline}** **[would
spur China to disable]{.underline}** **[these]{.underline}** critical
space **[systems]{.underline}**. Without their support, the war would be
much bloodier and costlier---a daunting proposition for any president.

**[Should the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[fail to intervene]{.underline}**, **[the
consequences]{.underline}** **[would be disastrous for]{.underline}**
both Washington and **[its allies]{.underline}** in East Asia, **[and
potentially the]{.underline}** **[credibility of]{.underline}** **[U.S.
defense commitments]{.underline}** around the globe. Worse yet, however,
might be what could happen if China believes that such a threat will
succeed but proves to be wrong. **[History is rife]{.underline}**
**[with examples of]{.underline}** **[major wars]{.underline}**
**[arising from miscalculations]{.underline}** such as this, **[and
there are many pathways]{.underline}** **[by]{.underline}** **[which
such a situation]{.underline}** **[could]{.underline}** easily
**[escalate]{.underline}** out of control **[to a
full-scale]{.underline}** conventional conflict or even to **[nuclear
use]{.underline}**.

This Catch-22 of so-called "peaceful reunification" on the one hand and
catastrophic miscalculation on the other is entirely preventable. **[To
do so,]{.underline}** however, **[the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[must act
now]{.underline}**. **[To deter]{.underline}** **[such]{.underline}**
**[pre-positioning]{.underline}** **[and provide a]{.underline}**
**[clear framework]{.underline}** **[for how to handle it]{.underline}**
if it does occur, **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[should]{.underline}** **[immediately begin
coordinating]{.underline}** **[with its allies]{.underline}** **[to
establish]{.underline}** **[shared understandings]{.underline}** **[for
the rules]{.underline}** and operations **[of
warning]{.underline}**/self-defense zones **[in orbit.]{.underline}**
Additionally, the United States should develop and deploy bodyguard
spacecraft to monitor and enforce such rules.

**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[cannot]{.underline}** afford to **[wait]{.underline}**; **[once the
potential threat arrives]{.underline}**, **[it will]{.underline}**
already **[be too late]{.underline}**.

NATO in Cyber and Outer Space

**[[Cyber and space is]{.mark} a [promising]{.mark} arena [for NATO to
address China]{.mark} challenges [by]{.mark} [building]{.mark} member
state [resilience]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Like the air and sea domains,
as areas that belong to no one state and which provide access to much of
the globe, they form part of the global commons. [Command of the commons
has been the key enabler of the US global position of power for many
decades.]{.mark}26 However, **[[China]{.mark}
[wields]{.mark}]{.underline}** a sufficient range of **[sea, air, cyber,
and space [capabilities such that the global commons is]{.mark} now a
[contested]{.mark} zone]{.underline}**. In contrast to the sea and air
domains, **[cyber and space are sparsely regulated. This [lack
of]{.mark} international [norms enhances the risk of conflict]{.mark}
based on misperception, [making NATO cooperation pertinent. Adversarial
activities]{.mark} toward the US and Europe in the cyber and space
domain threaten transatlantic security. These [come not just from China,
but also]{.mark}]{.underline}** from other adversaries such as
**[[Russia and Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Mechanisms for addressing
these challenges in the military sector are essentially generic and not,
at least in their basic design, established with a particular country in
mind. Thus, **[[cyber and space provide]{.mark} an [avenue]{.mark} for
NATO [to contribute significantly to deterrence]{.mark} of China
[without having to combat]{.mark} major [internal
resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. NATO would also benefit from
long-standing US-EU cooperation on cyber and space issues.27

Cyber and space provide an avenue for NATO to contribute without major
internal resistance

**[NATO has vowed to clarify Article Five's collective defense
commitment to encompass threats to satellites in space and coordinated
cyberattacks. NATO can design this]{.underline}** effort **[to include
adversarial behavior from China]{.underline}**. The alliance already has
an array of instruments to deal with cyber and space challenges from
adversaries. These can be extended to encompass China without
pronouncing it a threat.28 **[This]{.underline}** approach **[allows the
US and Europe time to adjust their cooperation to take into
account]{.underline}** the fact **[that China poses military threats to
them]{.underline}** both **[without]{.underline}** explicitly **[using
the language of threat]{.underline}** at a time when NATO members do not
agree if China should be defined as a challenge that can trigger Article
Five responses.

Since the late 1990s, [the vulnerability of shared space assets to
cyberattacks]{.mark} has been a concern for both the US and Europe. For
example, in 1998 a US-German satellite, used for peering into deep
space, was rendered useless after it turned suddenly toward the sun,
damaging its High Resolution Imager by exposure. NASA later determined
that the accident was linked to a cyber-intrusion at the Goddard Space
Flight Center. Coordinated cyberattacks have emerged as a major threat
to both the US and Europe since the late 1990s. For example, for about
eighteen minutes on April 8, 2010, China Telecom advertised erroneous
network traffic routes that instructed US and other foreign internet
traffic to travel through Chinese servers. Other servers around the
world quickly adopted these paths, routing all traffic, including
government and military traffic, to about 15 percent of the internet's
destinations through servers located in China.29

In the future, the need **[to [enhance]{.mark} situational [awareness in
space is likely to lead to further integration of space assets between
the US and]{.mark} its [allies. Civilian entry
points]{.mark}]{.underline}** are likely to **[[provide]{.mark} a
growing opportunity for [infiltration. The weak state of]{.mark}
cybersecurity in civilian [agencies should]{.mark} also [be considered.
Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline}** military **[[doctrine
prioritizes]{.underline}]{.mark}** weaponry that targets vulnerabilities
in the deployment of US and allied power, such as the **[[use of
cyberattacks to disrupt]{.mark} surveillance [assets,
intel]{.mark}]{.underline}**ligence networks, **[[and
c]{.underline}]{.mark}**ommand-**[[and-c]{.underline}]{.mark}**ontrol
systems.30 These threats are significant, since **[next generation
systems]{.underline}**, including fighter aircraft, destroyers, and
special forces, **[will not function without access to space
communication]{.underline}** and space-derived data.

Although European and US allies have indigenous space programs outside
the **[[NATO framework]{.underline}]{.mark}**, cyber security and outer
space **[[would be]{.mark} a [useful]{.mark} field [for]{.mark} joint
explorations of [how to]{.mark} divert and [manage attacks]{.mark} and
identify an agency which can coordinate]{.underline}** transatlantic
**[responses to attacks]{.underline}**. Allies are embedded in a range
of information networks which may be disrupted, giving rise to alliance
management concerns emerging from attacks. **[The [lack of red lines
regarding behavior]{.mark} in cyber and outer space]{.underline}**
between the US and its allies on one hand, and adversaries such as China
on the other, **[[adds to the risk of]{.mark} misperception and
[escalation, and]{.mark} hence also [highlights the need for]{.mark}
allied [coordination to]{.mark} [avoid]{.mark} starting [a war by
mistake]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[An improved [NATO dialogue]{.mark} on
safeguards]{.underline}** and alliance consultation **[[could]{.mark}
also [assist]{.mark} communication [with]{.mark}]{.underline}** China on
arms control and **[[conflict prevention in]{.mark} cyber]{.underline}**
and **[outer [space]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which is not currently
taking place.

Looking to the future, **[[NATO's success]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
establishing transatlantic mechanisms for cyber and outer space
safeguards and consultation **[[will be crucial to]{.mark} allow NATO a
key role in [taking on the China challenge in ways that]{.mark} help
[restore faith in NATO's credibility as a provider of]{.mark} collective
[defense in all domains. It will]{.mark} also [assist NATO in straddling
the chasm]{.mark} between]{.underline}** member states prioritizing
threats **[[from]{.underline}]{.mark}** either China,
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the **[[M]{.underline}]{.mark}**iddle
**[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**ast, or **[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**orth
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**frica, **[[since]{.mark} cyber and space
[threats]{.mark}]{.underline}** potentially **[[stem from all of
them]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the effectiveness of cyber and space
defense mechanisms do not necessarily depend on geographical origin.

**[Cyber and space would allow NATO a key role in the China challenge
without prioritizing China]{.underline}**.

**[Unlike during the Cold War]{.underline}**, **[when
space]{.underline}** **[was dominated by a few]{.underline}** major
**[powers]{.underline}**, **[space has become]{.underline}**
increasingly **[democratized]{.underline}**. As of 2019, over 60
countries have a national space budget, over 70 countries own or operate
satellites in orbit, and nine countries---plus the European Space
Agency---can independently launch into orbit.4 **[This
growing]{.underline}** international **[engagement]{.underline}** **[in
space presents]{.underline}** enormous **[opportunities for
defense]{.underline}** space **[partnerships]{.underline}**. This new
era also presents serious risks. **[Space is becoming]{.underline}**
increasingly **[contested]{.underline}**. In April 2020, Russia tested a
direct ascent anti-satellite missile.5 A few months earlier, U.S.
officials called out Russian satellites for trailing a U.S. national
security satellite.6 Also in April 2020, Chris Ford, a senior official
in the State Department, said that China was exploring capabilities to
attack U.S. satellites, including in high orbits such as those of U.S.
nuclear command, control, and communications satellites.7 **[The
seriousness of the threat]{.underline}** **[underlines the importance
of]{.underline}** **[defense]{.underline}** space
**[partnerships]{.underline}**---**[the]{.underline}**

**[[should not]{.mark} try to]{.underline}** **[[manage]{.mark} these
threats purely [on its own.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

To enable more international defense space partnerships, U.S. leadership
will need to treat such partnerships as a strategic priority, not as an
afterthought or add on. This chapter looks at advantages, challenges,
and mitigations for broadening and deepening security space partnerships
that could prompt key decision points during the next presidential term.

Advantages of Partnerships

Defense space partnerships offer considerable advantages. These include
allowing the United States to expand and improve its network and
capabilities with fewer resources, deter adversaries from attacking its
systems, and coalesce allied and partner thinking on space security
concepts.8 A look at some common space maturity metrics suggests that
many of the most mature space nations in the world are partners of the
United States. Specifically:

[The United States and its close partners make up 11 out of the top 15
countries with the biggest national space budgets.9]{.mark}

Of the roughly 2,700 active satellites in orbit, over 500 are operated
by international partners and over 1,300 are operated by the United
States.10

- Among the world's 22 active space launch centers, six are operated by
  partners and five by the United States.11

**[Many allies are]{.underline}** also **[taking steps to
emphasize]{.underline}** **[the seriousness]{.underline}** **[of space
security]{.underline}**. In the past year, France and Japan have
established their own military units dedicated to space.12 The United
Kingdom officially recognized space as an operational domain in 2018.13
And NATO, which historically has said little on space, came out with a
space policy in 2019.14 **[Given the space maturity]{.underline}** **[of
many of its allies]{.underline}** and partners, **[and the shared
recognition]{.underline}** **[of the importance]{.underline}** **[of the
domain]{.underline}**, **[the time is advantageous]{.underline}** **[for
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[to place more priority]{.underline}** **[on
establishing]{.underline}** and deepening **[space
partnerships]{.underline}** **[for defense]{.underline}**. Expand and
Improve Networks and Capabilities.

**[[Partners]{.mark} have capabilities]{.underline}** **[that can
[improve]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}**[U.S.]{.underline}**
**[[systems]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and networks [in]{.mark}
geographically [dispersed]{.mark}]{.underline}** and strategic
**[[locations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[This is particularly true
in]{.underline}** **[s]{.underline}**pace **[s]{.underline}**ituational
**[a]{.underline}**wareness, **[an area in which]{.underline}** **[a
[diverse set]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}**
**[geographically]{.underline}**-**[distributed sensors]{.underline}**
**[can [more accurately]{.mark}]{.underline}** and completely
**[[capture]{.mark} the]{.underline}** **[operational
[environment]{.mark}]{.underline}**.15 **[Partners]{.underline}** can
**[help us [collectively attain more]{.mark} persistent]{.underline}**
**[surveillance]{.underline}** **[and [continuous]{.mark}]{.underline}**
global **[[coverage]{.mark} of satellites and debris, which is only
possible]{.underline}** **[if we have more]{.underline}** and better
**[sensors]{.underline}** in a variety of locations. Radars and optical
telescopes spread around the world can also more comprehensively
identify space threats. For example, Japan is developing a deep-space
radar that will observe objects in geosynchronous orbit. Given the
counterspace threats from potential adversaries, the radar could also be
invaluable to the United States because of its capability and location.

[Additionally, space capabilities and operations are expensive. A clear
advantage of military space partnerships is that they generate
opportunities for sharing the financial burden of operating in
space.]{.mark} As an example, the United States putting its security
payloads on the Norwegian satellite will reportedly generate up to \$900
million in savings.17 Hosting U.S. payloads on foreign systems, like
this example, represents an area in which the United States could
leverage allied and partner capabilities more so than it does currently.
Hosted payloads offer affordable means to expand protected
communications satellites; position, navigation, and timing satellites;
and space situational awareness capabilities, among other systems.
Rather than host payloads, partners can also simply contribute to the
cost of a satellite system. For example, through multilateral
agreements, Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and New
Zealand provided funding for the U.S. Wideband Global SATCOM-9 satellite
that launched in March 2017.18 Or the United States can use partners'
satellites. For example, the United States partners with Japan and
Europe to obtain weather information from space-based sensors, providing
accurate weather information to warfighters around the world and
avoiding the need to field additional U.S. systems.19 And it is not just
satellites and payloads. Partners have terrestrial infrastructure and
user equipment, including for position, navigation, and timing and
satellite communications, that can be used collectively to achieve
needed capabilities more efficiently. Leveraging allied systems can
offer technological insights, system improvements, and capability
expansions at lower costs.

[**[several]{.underline}** **[allied]{.underline}**]{.mark} and partner
**[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Deployment of
NATO's]{.underline}** **[multinational battlegroups]{.underline}**
**[in]{.underline}** **[the eastern part]{.underline}** of the Alliance
(Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland) is an example of this concept
in the ground domain. **[If Russia's military were to
invade]{.underline}** Estonia **[and attack]{.underline}** **[the
multinational forces]{.underline}** there, **[the invasion could be
seen]{.underline}** **[as not just an attack]{.underline}** **[on
Estonia but]{.underline}** **[on all of the countries]{.underline}**
represented in those forces **[and]{.underline}** perhaps all of
**[NATO]{.underline}**.20 A May 2017 NATO fact sheet on its
multinational forces reaffirms this: "\[The multinational\] presence
makes clear that an attack on one Ally will be considered an attack on
the whole Alliance."21 **[Similarly]{.underline}**, **[in the space
domain, an]{.underline}** **[attack on a U.S.
constellation]{.underline}** **[of satellites]{.underline}**
**[with]{.underline}** **[U.S. payloads]{.underline}** **[might prompt a
response from]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates; **[an [attack
on]{.mark} a]{.underline}** **[satellite]{.underline}**
**[[constellation with]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[a]{.underline}** **[mix
of [U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[and]{.underline}**

**[capabilitie[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** might **[[prompt]{.mark} a
[response]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[from several
countries]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[acting collectively]{.underline}**,
**[which]{.underline}** may **[[help deter]{.mark} a
potential]{.underline}** **[[adversary]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[from]{.underline}** **[attacking in the first]{.underline}**
**[place]{.underline}**.

**[With integrated]{.underline}** allied and partner
**[[systems]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[U.S. satellite
networks]{.underline}** and ground infrastructure, as well as other
equipment and capabilities, **[can [become more

have]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[the [larger an]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[attack]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[would need to be]{.underline}** to
take out a given percentage of capability: all else equal, two
satellites would be more resilient than one, three satellites more
resilient than two, and so on. **[The resilience]{.underline}**
**[offered]{.underline}** by integrating allied and partner capabilities
into a network, therefore, may also **[contribute to

**[adversary]{.underline}** **[from attacking]{.underline}** the

**[more [crowded]{.mark}]{.underline}**: **[in the last 60
years]{.underline}** **[nearly 8,500]{.underline}**
**[objects]{.underline}** have been **[launched to space]{.underline}**,
about 1,500 in geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) and about 7,000 in low
Earth orbit (LEO) (McDowell 2018). **[A [large fraction
remains]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Figure 2-1) **[especially [in
LEO]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Figure 2-2). Going forward, LEO is expected
to become more crowded. As an illustration, **[over 6,200]{.underline}**
small **[satellites]{.underline}** (satellites weighing less than 500
kg) are **[expected to be launched]{.underline}** between 2017 and 2026
(Euroconsult 2017a). Although the main space players will continue to
dominate (85 percent of the government space market will remain
concentrated in the 10 countries with an established space
industry---U.S., Russia, China, Japan, India, and the top five European
countries), the other 50 countries engaged in space will launch almost
200 satellites by 2026, twice the number they launched over the past 10
years (Euroconsult 2017a, b).

**[The [concern]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[is]{.mark} not]{.underline}**
just **[the [increasing]{.mark} number of satellites]{.underline}** and
active payloads, **[but the amount of [debris]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(rocket bodies, other inert bodies, dead payloads) **[[in]{.mark} earth
[orbit]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which comprises more than 95 percent of
the currently tracked objects in space. The U.S. Department of Defense
(DoD) is currently tracking 23,000 objects larger than 10 cm in diameter
in Earth orbit (of these, almost 16,000 are in LEO, of which nearly
13,000 were classified as space debris ). An estimated 500,000 objects
larger than 1 cm in diameter are not currently tracked, and over 100
million objects smaller than 1 mm in diameter are likely not trackable
(NASA Orbital Debris Program Office). It is not

trivial to identify space debris and other junk, especially objects
under 10 cm, using active beacons or other markers (e.g., radiofrequency
tracking); they need to be physically spotted and tracked. Starting in
2019, the U.S. Air Force\'s Space Fence System will bring the catalog of
debris tracked by Space Command from 23,000 to an estimated 200,000
objects. Figure 2-1 and Figure 2-2 visually show the overwhelming
fraction of debris in space by orbit.

In addition to implications for the safety and sustainability of the
future space environment, these capabilities have other policy
implications. For example, the principal reason Swarm Technologies\'
sandwich-sized \"Space Bees\" did not get a spectrum license from the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was due to concerns that they
might not be tracked consistently by DoD.7,8

2\. Growing Number of Operators in Space

It is not just the number of satellites that is increasing: the number
of satellite operators has been increasing steadily over the last 60
years (Figure 2-3). **[More countries have become active in
space]{.underline}**. Figure 2-4 plots data on number of satellites
launched by country, and shows the crowding in the 2010s. This changing
landscape is driven by two primary trends: increasing State interest in
independent national space programs and the globalization of the
aerospace industry (Schroegl 2018).

**[[Smaller]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[lighter]{.underline}**, **[and
more capable [satellites]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[make]{.underline}**]{.mark} Earth observation and **[remote
[sensing]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[within]{.mark} the
[reach]{.mark}]{.underline}** not just **[[of]{.underline}]{.mark}**
countries, but also **[[corporations]{.mark} and
individuals]{.underline}**. For example, Bank Rakyat in Indonesia has
launched a satellite, built by Space System Loral and launched by
Arianespace, to manage its 50 million accounts. Another example is the
satellite launched by NanoRacks by an individual who wanted to fly a
cubesat and was able to afford it. **[This [trend]{.mark} is likely [to
continue]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[making the space
environment]{.underline}** increasingly **[more crowded]{.underline}**.
\*\*\*FIGURE 2-1,2,3,4 OMITTED\*\*\*There is also growing participation
in space by the private sector. It is important to note, however, that
private space, especially in the near- and mid-term, is primarily a U.S.
phenomenon. For most other countries, space is still a
strategically-oriented government-run activity. Of the 44 companies that
plan to launch constellations between 2017 and 2025, 20 are in the
United States (Lal et al. 2017). Of the almost 10,000 satellites that
are expected to launch as part of constellations, over 80 percent are
from companies in the United States (Euroconsult 2016). More generally,
of the 1,700 space companies listed by NewSpace Ventures, about half are
headquartered in the United States; the remaining half were distributed
around the rest of the world (see Figure 2-5).

The increased number of owners and operators requires more coordination
and governance in space, given that a standardization system to
coordinate on-orbit behaviors across operators (other than spectrum,
which is coordinated by the ITU) does not currently exist. Each private
entity (e.g., universities, research institutes, non-profits, commercial
companies) is governed by its licensing nation, potentially resulting in
a varied set of behaviors in space. This issue could be exacerbated as
the number of nations launching government assets as well as licensing
private entities continues to increase. 

3\. Changing Space Activities and Architectures

The current U.S. military SSA system relies heavily on sensors
originally created for missile warning and works relatively well for
tracking satellites in simple orbits around Earth. However, emerging
architectures will change the way objects will need to be tracked
Emerging applications, including missions related to rendezvous and
proximity operations, such as satellite servicing and refueling,
inspection, space RF mapping, and space-based spacecraft assembly and
manufacturing, will require SSA services that would be qualitatively
different than the current system.

For example, formation flying---the ability for satellites to act as
single units while they maintain similar orbits and operate within close
proximity to one another---poses challenges to current DoD SSA systems,
as these systems are not optimized to differentiate objects that are
closer together; the space of uncertainty around each object is
compromised by each object\'s closeness to other satellites in the
constellation. Additionally, tracking and predicting the orbits of
constellations containing hundreds of small satellites may challenge
existing systems due to the number and size of objects involved. Going
forward, the number of satellites in such systems is expected to
increase. Figure 2-6 shows 60 companies that have plans to launch
constellations. While only a fraction of these plans are likely to pan
out, it is an important driver of changes required in the SSA system.
Beyond constellations, further changes in the space sector include
growing activity in several other areas beyond remote sensing and
communication. \*\*\*BEGIN FOOTNOTE 10\*\*\*One example of a new
activity is the **[removal of space debris]{.underline}** -- the goal
being to decrease the number of objects in space and thus reduce
collision risk. **[[Beyond]{.mark} the [technical]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[and regulatory challenges]{.underline}**]{.mark} (e.g., restrictions
on the ability to move an object even if it is no longer in use),
**[[any]{.mark}
[d]{.mark}]{.underline}**e**[[b]{.underline}]{.mark}**ris
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**emoval **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**ction
**[[will require more]{.underline}]{.mark}** and more accurate
**[[SSA]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\*\*\*END FOOTNOTE 10\*\*\* Countries are
operating satellites across orbits with varied capabilities, further
complicating orbital prediction as the nature of any object in space
becomes further unpredictable. Satellite operations automation, the
continuous thrust allowed by electric propulsion, and other non-
Keplerian activities for which the DoD system is not optimized make
tracking difficult as the satellites\' orbits can change any time,
compromising the effectiveness of orbit prediction.

The popularity of electric propulsion on satellites has grown since the
1990s and implementation has increased sharply in the last decade; many
of the proposed large LEO constellations require electric propulsion
(Lev et al. 2017) and many GEO satellites now use electric propulsion as
well. Unlike chemical thrusters, which impart thrust at one time,
electric propulsion systems can impart thrust over the course of many
months. This increases the number of observations needed to understand
the satellite\'s new orbit. It also creates challenges for astrodynamics
algorithms that model maneuvers as instantaneous, as well as catalog
maintenance routines that only update orbits every several hours (such
as that of the 18 SPCS). This capability can also be used to change a
satellite\'s orbit mid-life, further complicating tracking. Although
many small satellites do not have an on-board propulsion system, some
small satellites in low Earth orbit can change their orbit by orienting
themselves in such a way to increase atmospheric drag, again affecting
projections of the satellites trajectories. Impulsive maneuvers through
chemical propulsion bring their own set of challenges, given that a
spacecraft moving with electric propulsion can be reflected in the
surveillance data (e.g., through a negative drag coefficient) as long as
the thrust is constant. Additionally, impulsive maneuvers can be
challenging to account for with existing U.S. military satellite
surveillance capabilities; thus, the image from a surveillance system is
not reliable, given that more impulsive maneuvers may occur. An accurate
prediction of such an object requires operator-level data that details
whether a maneuver is taking place. This operator data is often not
openly shared with providers; the necessity of this information suggests
that cooperation for SSA is inevitable. An example of this is the
actions of Space Data Association (SDA) in GEO, and a similar effort is
likely in LEO, especially in response to the large satellite
constellations that have been proposed (Schrogel, 2018).

Materials and specifics of satellites---e.g., size (smaller satellites
and components), composition, and antenna technology both hardware and
software (e.g., software defined radio)--- can make the satellites more
difficult to detect, especially given the limitations imposed by the
rotation speeds of telescopes, which minimize the opportunities to sight
and track objects. More efficient and smaller space electronics mean
that power requirements of systems are shrinking, which in turn reduces
the need for large solar panels. This not only reduces the satellite
cross section, but may also reduce the reflectivity of satellites.

New technologies and smaller satellite components have enabled satellite
operators to increase the capabilities of satellites in ever-smaller
form factors. New materials used in satellite composition affect
tracking attributes such as reflectivity. Cubesats and chipsats have
smaller cross-sections and are thus more difficult to observe. These
cross-sections are reduced even further by the improved technologies
that allow for smaller antennas and solar panels. The cubesat standard
is a satellite architecture based on 10 cm-wide units. This standard has
led to an increase in commercial availability of small standardized
parts, which in turn has led to a decrease in the price of components
for such satellites, which can now be mass produced rather than built
individually and/or by hand. Additionally, major providers of launch
services have designed satellite deployment units for the cubesat
standard, further increasing the number of entities that will use this
standard when designing satellites. Chipsats are standalone satellites
built onto computer chips approximately the size of a credit card.
Because of their size, many of these satellites do not have propulsion
units, making predictions of their orbits easier once they are detected.
However, due to their small form factors, initial and follow-up
detection is difficult without higher resolution telescopes. One reason
FCC turned down the Swarm Technologies\' license application was that
there was concern that their satellites were too small to be reliably
tracked by DoD.

**[[Future]{.mark} space [activities]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[that
[allow]{.mark}]{.underline}** and often require **[close
[proximity]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[of]{.mark} space
[objects]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g., rendezvous and docking, on-orbit
servicing or assembly) **[[will require]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[even
[more]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[precise]{.underline}]{.mark}** orbital
**[estimations and [predictions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[to avoid
collisions]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Companies engaged in such activities
would need to supplement DoD information with on-board or space-based
sensors to more precisely assess their location with regard to other
objects in close proximity.

B. Growing Concerns about Increasing Collisions

Although relatively few catastrophic collisions have occurred thus far
in space, the **[[likelihood of]{.mark} a [collision is]{.mark}
predicted [to increase]{.mark} in the]{.underline}** near
**[future]{.underline}**, **[given the expected]{.underline}**
**[growing number]{.underline}** of objects in both LEO and GEO **[and
limited ability to track]{.underline}** objects\' orbits, which will
make it difficult for operators to adequately avoid threats. This
problem may be exacerbated if any of the proposed constellations of
small satellites in LEO (shown in Figure 2-6 above) are launched, as
they will **[dramatically increase]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}**
**[number of objects]{.underline}** **[that [require]{.mark}
tracking]{.underline}**, thus **[[increasing]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
tracking and **[[computation]{.mark}al requirements [for
SSA]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** general and
**[conjunction [warnings]{.mark}]{.underline}** in particular. Some
industry representatives interviewed for the project noted that the
emergence of constellations is driving the need for higher precision
knowledge and services to mitigate the risk of collision: if numerous
small satellites are deployed at once, tracking can be difficult, as
resolution may not be great enough to distinguish multiple satellites.

NASA projects nearly one collision per year in the next 200 years if
there is no debris mitigation. Independently, insurance companies have
predicted a total exposure of \$1.3 billion in LEO and \$18 billion in
GEO (Lal et al. 2015).

To estimate the number of collisions resulting from the increasing
number of small satellites, several simulations of expected collisions
per year for a number of large satellite constellations in LEO over 200
years have been conducted (Muelhaupt 2017). One such exercise evaluated
the effect of adding two large constellations---those of SpaceX and
OneWeb---to the current constellations in LEO (Iridium, Orbcomm, and
Globalstar). The simulations found that within its first 20 years in
orbit, the first constellation is expected to cause one collision
annually; this number would grow to approximately 8 per year at its peak
collision rate, which occurs about 190 years after launch (see Figure
2-7). **[Although the majority of the collisions]{.underline}** in the
simulation **[were]{.underline}** **[due to satellites]{.underline}**
**[that failed to be deorbited]{.underline}** following end-of-life
protocol, **[satellites that]{.underline}** **[did
attempt]{.underline}** **[to be deorbited]{.underline}** **[still
accounted for]{.underline}** approximately **[40 percent]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}** the total **[collisions]{.underline}**.

Given that the systems developed to track space objects were developed
at a time there were fewer objects in space, the **[[accuracy]{.mark} of
prediction [is low]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Oftentimes, a
**[[DoD]{.underline}]{.mark}** conjunction **[[warning]{.mark}
[message]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[has an error]{.mark}
ellipse]{.underline}** **[of 100 km or more]{.underline}**; **[the [rate
of false positives]{.mark} is [high]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[as
well]{.underline}**. Because of these two factors, as traffic in space
grows, both the number of conjunction warning messages as well as the
rates of both false positives---and false negatives--- are likely to
increase. For example, one study estimated that upon launch of its
proposed constellation, SpaceX would receive 7.2 million conjunction
warnings per year, and Iridium would receive about 384,000 per year.
Some operators, aware of the increasing risk of collision, will be more
likely to pay heed to notifications. This could result in increased
maneuvers as operators attempt to avoid collision, even if the warning
is not sound. These maneuvers---even if they are reported to the
providers of SSA (e.g., the DoD, or commercial vendors), which may often
not be the case---will still contribute to uncertainty regarding
objects\' paths, thus compromising the resulting predictions. Other
operators, especially those with low-value assets, are likely to
continue to ignore warnings as they currently do, which is equally
problematic as they will collide with debris or put the onus to maneuver
fully on the operator of the asset it threatens.

**[To avoid a significant increase]{.underline}** in notifications,
**[operators will]{.underline}** increasingly **[look for higher quality
SSA]{.underline}** information. **[This could put]{.underline}**
**[further pressure on emerging systems]{.underline}** **[to improve
their predictions]{.underline}**.

C. Changing National Level Motivations

Space is increasingly recognized as a sector of strategic importance
with applications for security, capacity building, and social benefit.
The increasing number of countries seeking to use space for science,
safety, national security, and commercial purposes means increased
threats (both accidental and nefarious) of collision and harm to assets
(e.g., through radiofrequency interference).

1\. Growing Recognition of the Need for Timely and Actionable SSA
Services and Products

As space capabilities become integral to more applications (e.g., earth
observation, communications, global positioning), [a growing number of
countries are recognizing the security and economic value of space and
increasing their spending in space.]{.mark} The number of countries
involved in space continues to increase: a decade ago, fewer than 50
countries were investing in space; today, there are 70. In the coming
decade, that number is expected to increase to more than 80 countries,
and the annual government space expenditure globally is expected to
double, from about \$40 billion in 2006 to \$80 billion in 2026
(Euroconsult 2017b, c). This increased value (both mission-specific and
financial) has led many nations to treat safety of such assets as higher
priority, leading to growing efforts to develop norms and guidelines for
behavior in space. Additionally, many countries (e.g., Brazil, China,
France, Japan, and South Africa) want to be (and be viewed as)
responsible stewards of space, and thus support these efforts.

In our dataset of 18 countries, most of those actively pursuing SSA
focus on protecting their assets from satellite collisions---due to both
the increasing number of assets and the increasing amount of space
debris on orbit. Some countries (e.g., Japan, Canada) generally pursue
protection of their space assets and interests---either for the sake of
those assets specifically, or for the role they play in national
security broadly. Some countries are more interested in the application
of SSA (e.g., the data products) while others (e.g., Japan) value the
collection and analysis side as well. SSA can also help with safe
operation and control of assets. Though most are concerned with on-orbit
collision warnings, some, such as India, use SSA only to avoid collision
on launch.

Interviewees from some nations, such as Germany, noted that SSA can be
useful in protecting what has been achieved in space thus far and
avoiding major incidents. [ESA\'s SSA program is interested in
developing a hazard warning system by federating existing European
assets and developing new sensor technology, with the goal of securing
Europe\'s access to space, protecting the involved economies, and
strengthening European industry.]{.mark}

Some countries prioritize detection of risks to their territory, and
thus seek to detect either threats on reentry such as rogue space assets
(e.g., France) or natural threats such as space weather and asteroids
(e.g., South Africa). Some are specifically interested in protecting
their satellites used for Earth observation; for example,
representatives of Brazil note the importance of using space to protect
its borders given significant issues with drug trafficking. This
**[increasing reliance on space]{.underline}** **[assets]{.underline}**
for security **[necessitates greater]{.underline}**
**[interest]{.underline}** in and efforts **[toward SSA]{.underline}**.
**[For some]{.underline}** (e.g., UK), **[SSA is seen as underpinning
all other]{.underline}** space **[roles in that it details the
hazards]{.underline}**, risks, and threats **[to the
domain]{.underline}**.

Our discussions with stakeholders demonstrated some countries\' concerns
that if they do not participate in global discussions (e.g., long term
sustainability \[LTS\] guidelines), their national interests will not be
appropriately reflected in the rules, and they will miss out on critical
opportunities. This involvement suggests that more countries are
becoming concerned with safe and sustainable operations in
space---keeping space open to activities in the future and preventing
problems (e.g., proliferating debris) from adversely impacting or
precluding space activities. It is important to note that smaller and
less powerful countries benefit greatly from these international
discussions, as they are given a voice in the proceedings. More powerful
and established nations may not always agree, as these deliberations
have to include more players and typically take longer to conclude
negotiations. This is specifically true for European countries;
stakeholders noted that Europe can only have a voice in future
regulations regarding the creation of global space traffic regulation if
the EU and ESA work together. They noted that for European industry to
become involved in challenging projects and thus be competitive on a
global scale, the involved nations need to organize at the European
level.

2\. **[Lack of Confidence in DoD]{.underline}**-Provided
**[Data]{.underline}**

Many **[[stakeholders indicated]{.mark} that they [need
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[have]{.mark} trust and
[confidence]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the data **[being
shared]{.underline}** **[for]{.underline}** collision
**[warnings]{.underline}** **[and other]{.underline}** SSA
**[products]{.underline}**; **[many acknowledged the]{.underline}**
**[usefulness of verifying]{.underline}** the information **[that is
part of any database]{.underline}**. **[There are
[many]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[concerns with]{.mark} the current
systems]{.underline}** for provision of SSA. Some **[operators question
the [accuracy]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark}
especially the **[[completeness]{.mark} of the]{.underline}**
**[information provided to them]{.underline}** [**[by the]{.underline}**
**[DoD]{.underline}**]{.mark}. For example, some South Korean government
officials estimate that their country receives data on only about 40
percent of the objects tracked by the DoD, due to sensitivity of U.S.
assets.

**[This [distrust]{.mark} is]{.underline}** further **[[complicated
by]{.mark} the [lack of transparency]{.mark}]{.underline}** related to
computing outcomes such as probabilities of collision. **[Owners and
[operators]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[believe]{.underline}**
**[they]{.underline}** **[[require more]{.mark} \[high [quality\]
information to]{.mark} make well-informed]{.underline}** decisions about
**[[maneuver]{.mark}ing]{.underline}**. But because they do not know the
process by which U.S.-provided information on an object\'s location is
processed into a collision assessment or warning, they often do not feel
confident maneuvering based on that warning. Skepticism regarding the
reliability of the shared information is exacerbated by the nonstandard
and nontransparent methods of calculation (often referred to by
stakeholders in our discussions as \"black box processing\"). Beyond the
distrust, **[some users perceive]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}**
U.S. **[[DoD systems]{.mark} as [limited]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[given that they are [not well-suited]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[to]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [emerging]{.mark}]{.underline}**
space **[[environment]{.underline}]{.mark}**; additionally, given the
separation of the provision of SSA from the DoD\'s core mission, it is
also perceived as overworked and understaffed, leading to further
dissatisfaction. There is also some concern that going forward, the
United States will either not share data or will charge for it. This
last concern has heightened the sense of urgency in some countries to
set up parallel SSA systems.

3\. National Security Considerations

**[Many of the 18 countries]{.underline}** **[are interested in

**[reconnaissance]{.underline}** (e.g., South Korean awareness of
potential North Korean targeting, France\'s goal of detecting objects
presenting a risk to its territory). Often the national security goal is
two- pronged: entities are interested in protecting their own assets
while building knowledge of the location and intention of adversary
assets.

or large (\>300 kg) satellites, and 2) that if LCs of medium or large
satellite are deployed, they are safer at lower orbits, such as 450-km
rather than at 600-km or 1,200-km orbits. The orbital capacity (number
and type of satellites that can be sustainably deployed) and tipping
point (at which it is no longer possible to avoid a Kessler Syndrome by
ceasing launches) concepts are demonstrated.

1\. INTRODUCTION

**[Humanity faces an existential crisis]{.underline}**; space debris are
at risk of becoming the equivalent of a \"drifting island of plastic\"
\[1\]. Large constellation (LC) systems plan to operate tens of
thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of satellites in low Earth
orbit (LEO) \[2\], posing the threat of an inglorious end to the Space
Age. **[A \"take risks and fail often]{.underline}**\"
**[approach]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}** **[new
technology]{.underline}** **[is being extended]{.underline}** **[to
space]{.underline}** **[without]{.underline}** **[considering that
mistakes in space cannot be cleaned up]{.underline}** **[as
easily]{.underline}** **[as they can]{.underline}** **[on
Earth]{.underline}**.

Satellites that cannot maneuver, cannot avoid collisions. Loss of
maneuverability can result from failures of satellite sub-systems in the
maneuver chain or from collisions with small (untracked) objects that
disable these subsystems. **[Passive deorbit]{.underline}**
**[times]{.underline}** **[can be minimized]{.underline}** **[with
lower]{.underline}** LEO **[altitudes]{.underline}** and larger
area-to-mass ratios **[but can still require years
depending]{.underline}** **[on the]{.underline}** solar
**[cycle]{.underline}** and larger area-to-mass ratios realized by
increasing area can **[lead to increased collision risk.]{.underline}**

Even satellites that can maneuver, can be involved in collisions.
Conjunction warnings may not be generated, not all lethal debris are
trackable. **[Every time a satellite is not maneuvered]{.underline}** in
response to a low probability conjunction warning, **[there is a
non-zero collision risk that depends on the s]{.underline}**pace
**[s]{.underline}**ituational **[a]{.underline}**wareness (SSA)
accuracy. Additionally, every time a satellite is maneuvered, there is
another non-zero probability that the maneuver will result in a
collision. In both cases, with a sufficient number of conjunctions
occurring, even six sigma events can become likely.

Collisions between LEO satellites are typically catastrophic resulting
in large numbers of new debris objects spread across LEO altitudes. For
example, there are currently 1439 tracked debris objects in orbit from
the 2009 collision between Iridium-33 and COSMOS-2251 \[3\]. Even though
the collision occurred at 800-km, the debris\' apogees now range from
400 km to over 1,600 km.

Constellations are appropriately analyzed over their orbital lifecycles.
LCs are incrementally deployed, and satellites are replenished as they
fail, reach end-of-life, or are replaced with more capable models. [This
replenishment can be reasonably modeled to continue until the
constellation is no longer economically viable.]{.mark} The result is a
continuing process of orbit raising and phasing, and a combination of
active and passive deorbiting.

Sub-system failures and small object collisions can be mitigated with
sub-system redundancy, and small objects collision can be further
mitigated with shielding. Operational techniques, such as initiating
deorbit immediately after the (N - 1)-th failure with N-th redundancy,
can be used to improve the effective satellite reliability.

Previous work \[4\] using a simplistic model showed that reducing the
number of non-maneuverable satellites significantly increases the time
to Kessler Syndrome, a self-sustaining collision cascade \[5\]. Another
approach \[2\] used simplified rate equations to model population
evolution. One of the simplifications was ignoring collisions of debris
with other debris, precluding the possibility of a Kessler Syndrome.

This paper expands on the previous work with more sophisticated Markov
models and Monte Carlo simulations to explore the dependence of time to
Kessler Syndrome on key parameters of LCs (the number of satellites, the
satellite sizes, and the orbits). The approach is not only useful in the
design of environmentally friendly broadband LEO systems, but also in
assessing the environmental impact of existing and planned LC systems.
Further, it can help in understanding the implications of multiple LCs
occupying interleaving or overlapping orbits.

While it is generally agreed that LEO is a finite resource and that
collisions may lead to loss of access to space \[6\]\[7\]\[8\]\[9\],
this work can be used to help address the key questions:

1\) How many satellites are too many? What is the \"orbital capacity\",
the number and type of satellites that can be sustainably deployed in
each orbit without risking a Kessler Syndrome?

2\) How close are we to a \"tipping point\", i.e., how urgent is this
issue? A tipping point in that point in time at which it is no longer
possible to avoid a Kessler Syndrome by ceasing launches.

This is an active area of research with numerous contributions,
including \[10\]\[11\]\[12\].

The models are described in Section 2, Section 3 discusses the
simulation results, and the conclusions are summarized in Section 4.

2\. MODELS

A model is developed to explore the dependence of time to Kessler
Syndrome on the constellation sizes and orbits, and on the size of the
satellites deployed. The key simplifying assumptions employed to create
this model are:

1\. Only the LCs being studied are replenished over time, other
constellations and individual satellites are not replaced as they
deorbit, fail, or fragment.

2\. No new rocket bodies are left in orbit.

3\. Collisions with debris between 1 cm and 10 cm never result in
fragmentation, only the possibility of damage resulting in loss of
maneuverability, and the estimated 128 million debris from 1 mm to 1 cm
\[13\] are ignored.

4\. All orbits are circular, including those of satellites, debris, and
rocket bodies, and orbits are fully characterized by their altitude and
inclination.

5\. Objects are grouped into classes with one set of characteristics
modeled for each class.

6\. The probability of non-maneuverable satellites experiencing
catastrophic collisions is approximated as described in Section 2.4.1.

The first three assumptions are believed to be optimistic. Further work
is required to access the impact of the last three.

Objects are divided into 10 classes. At the top level, objects are
categorized as satellite (S), debris (D), or rocket body (RB).
Satellites are sub-categorized as maneuverable (SM) or non-maneuverable
(SN). They are further sub-categorized by mass: large (SML and SNL) for
mass greater than 300 kg, medium (SMM and SNM) for mass

between 25 kg and 300 kg, and small (SMS and SNS) for mass less than 25
kg. Debris are sub-categorized by diameter, large (DL) for 1 to 3 m
diameter, medium (DM) for 0.3 to 1 m diameter, and small (DS) for 0.1 to
0.3 m diameter. Rocket bodies (RB) are not further sub-categorized.

For each class, the number of objects in each orbit is stored in a
matrix with the structure shown in Fig. 1. The possible orbits include
all altitudes between 200 km and 2,000 km in 25 km bins (Sh = 25 km),
and all inclinations between 0° and 180° in 10° bins (Si = 10°). The
number of objects in each bin at time tm is X\^ . These matrices are
initialized using Space-Track SATCAT data \[3\]. A total of 16,621 LEO
orbits were used - 3,773 maneuverable satellites, 920 non-maneuverable
satellites, 10,992 debris, and 957 rocket bodies.

The LC orbit models are discussed in Section 2.1 and the object models
in Section 2.2. Section 2.3 introduces the state evolution model, and
the state transition probabilities are derived in Section 2.4. The
object life process models are discussed in Section 2.5.

2.1 Large Constellation (LC) Orbit Models

Three LC orbits are considered: 1) 450 km altitude at 40° inclination,
2) 600 km altitude at 50° inclination, and 3) 1,200 km altitude at 60°
inclination. These were selected to be representative of the LC orbits
proposed for various NGSO systems \[2\].

2.2 Object Models

The key parameters for each object class are shown in Tab. 1. They are
representative of objects in each class and are not based on any
specific objects. The area-to-mass ratios (A/M) of the non-maneuverable
satellites are modeled as one-half of those for the maneuverable
satellites to account for tumbling.

2.3 State Evolution Model

State evolution is modeled as shown in Fig. 2. Newly launched satellites
start in the Maneuverable State. At each time step, there are four
possibilities for evolution of maneuverable satellites (SML, SMM,
SMS): 1) transition to

the Non-Maneuverable State due to a failure or due to small object
collision damage that disables maneuverability, 2) transition to the
Fragmentation Process as the result of a large object collision, 3)
transition to the Decay Process due to atmospheric drag, or 4) remain in
the Maneuverable State.

Non-maneuverable Satellites (SNL, SNM, SNS), Debris (DL, DM, DS), and
Rocket Bodies (RB) are always in the Non-Maneuverable State. There are
three possibilities for these objects: 1) transition to the
Fragmentation Process as the result of a large object collision, 2)
transition to the Decay Process due to atmospheric drag, or 3) remain in
the Non-Maneuverable State.

2.4 Transition Probability Models

These models are used to calculate the transition probabilities for the
objects in each state at each time step. 2.4.1 Probability of
Non-Maneuverable Object Catastrophic Collision

PN2F is the probability of an object transitioning from the
Non-Maneuverable state to the Fragmentation process. The probability
that an object with radius r, in an orbit with altitude hj, inclination
ik, and shell thickness Sh experiences a collision over one orbit period
at time tm is given by

where is the total number of objects at altitude hj and inclination iq
at time tm, and noting that orbits are modeled as circular and the
object radius, r, is much less than Sh so that

The probability that an object in an orbit with altitude hj and
inclination ik experiences a collision with an object in an orbit with
altitude hj and inclination iq is approximated by

The first factor in the \"otherwise\" value approximates the probability
that both objects are inside a square with sides 2r on the surface of a
sphere. When the difference in inclinations is such that the crossing
angles for planes in a LC are near 0 or n, the geometry degenerates to a
single dimension, and the appropriate probability to consider is that of
both objects being in a segment of the orbit circle with length 2r. The
second factor is the probability that two objects in a square on the
surface of the sphere are in the same cube within an orbit shell of
height Sh, or equivalently for the degenerative case.

2.4.2 Probability of Maneuverable Object Catastrophic Collision

The probability of a maneuverable satellite transitioning to the
fragment process (PM2F) is the probability of a collision avoidance
failure, either due to an untracked object, a low probability
conjunction prediction being ignored, or an avoidance maneuver causing a
collision. It is modeled as

PM2F = AvoidanceFailureRate x PN2F

The avoidance failure rate is set to 0.1%, which assumes that 999 out of
every 1,000 collisions that would be experienced if the satellite did
not maneuver are avoided using maneuverability.

2.4.3 Probability of Maneuverable Object Orbit Decay

PM2D is the probability of a satellite object transitioning from the
Maneuverable state to the Decay process. It is modeled based on the
estimated satellite lifetime as

where St is the simulation step size in seconds and SatelliteLifetime is
in years.

Satellite design life is modeled as 5 years.

2.4.4 Probability of Non-Maneuverable Object Orbit Decay

PN2D is the probability of a non-maneuverable object transitioning from
the Non-Maneuverable state to the Decay process. Assuming that
atmospheric drag is the only nonconservative force and modeling the
orbits as circular the change in altitude over one period is given by
\[14\]

where St is the simulation time step in seconds and Sh is the object
matrix altitude bin size in kilometers. 2.4.5 Probability of Satellite
Becoming Non-Maneuverable

The probability of a maneuverable satellite transitioning to the
non-maneuverable state (PM2N) is the probability of loss of
maneuverability. This can occur either due to a failure mechanism or a
small object collision. It is modeled based on the estimated satellite
lifetime, satellite failure rate over lifetime, and probability of
maneuverability being lost due to a small object collision

where St is the simulation step size in seconds and SatelliteLifetime is
in years.

The small collision factor is set to 5.3 assuming that only 20% of the
collisions with debris between 1 cm and 10 cm result in loss of
maneuverability and noting that ESA estimates \[13\] that there are
900,000 debris objects in that range compared to 34,000 above 10 cm (0.2
x 900,000 / 34,000 = 5.3).

2.5 Object Life Process Models

The launch, decay, and fragmentation processes manage the life cycle of
the objects.

2.5.1 Launch Process

The launch process maintains the LC(s) being evaluated at a fixed size
for the duration of the analysis. The appropriate object flux matrix
(SML, SMM, or SMS) is updated by maintaining a constant number of
satellites in the object matrix cell corresponding to the orbit
(altitude and inclination) of each LC at each timestep.

2.5.2 Decay Process

The decay process moves non-maneuverable objects to the next lower row
of the object matrix. If an object in the h1 row decays, it is assumed
to have completed deorbit, and is removed from the object matrix. For
maneuverable satellites, the decay process moves them to a 300-km
circular disposal orbit as non-maneuverable satellites.

2.5.3 Fragmentation Process

When a collision occurs, the fragmentation process removes the objects
involved from the associated object matrices, determines the numbers and
characteristics of the fragments, and adds the new objects to the
appropriate debris matrices. Fragments with perigee \<200 km or mean
altitude outside the 200 km to 2,000 km LEO range are dropped from the
model.

The Fragmentation Process is modeled based on the MASTER-8 version of
the EVOLVE 4.0 NASA Standard Breakup Model for spacecraft \[15\]. The
number of fragments is determined from a power law distribution
characterized by the object masses and the minimum and maximum object
sizes. It is well known that the NASA model does not conserve mass, and
many workarounds have been proposed. However, for this analysis, the
important quantiles are the number of fragments, their diameter
distribution, and their velocity distribution.

The number of fragments with size in the range from dMIN (m) to dMAX (m)
is given by

Assuming that all collisions are fragmenting (specific kinetic energy of
projectile, greater than 40 J/g) and truncating at a minimum fragment
size to dMIN and maximum fragment size to dMAX, the cdf for fragment
diameter is given by

Area-to-mass ratio is characterized by a bi-normal distribution
parametrized based on 5 = log10 (dF) for x = logw(A/MF)

where the parameters a, p1, oi, and a2 are functions of S.

The fragment delta velocity (m/s) is related to the fragment A/M (m2/kg)
for fragmenting collisions by

The delta velocity is uniformly distributed over a sphere, added to the
state vector for a randomly located object in the original orbit, and
the resulting state vector converted to orbital elements to determine
the delta altitude and inclination of each fragment relative to the
original orbit.

The number of fragments and distributions for the fragment diameters,
area-to-mass ratio, and delta altitude are shown in Fig. 3 for dMIN =
0.1 m and dMAX = 3 m. \*\*\*FIGURE 3 OMITTED\*\*\*

3\. SIMULATIONS

Monte Carlo simulations are used to characterize the debris population
sensitivity to LC orbits and satellite sizes over one hundred years, or
until a Kessler Syndrome occurs. The simulation flow is shown in Fig. 4.
\*\*\*FIGURE 4 OMITTED\*\*\*Initially, 146 cases were run, a baseline
case with the initial object matrices and no new satellite launches, and
an additional 145 cases based on 29 configurations (combinations) of
small (15 kg), medium (250 kg), and/or large (500 kg) satellites in the
three orbits considered. Each configuration results in 5 cases with
10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 40,000, or 50,000 satellites maintained in each
orbit. Depending on the case, from 10,000 to 150,000 satellites are
maintained in orbit.

The simulation parameters are summarized in Tab. 2. The start year is
used to determine the solar flux at each time step, which is used to
compute the atmospheric density in Section 2.4.4. The 100-year duration
was selected to focus on near-term (in a cosmic sense) events. The time
step, altitude bin size, and inclination bin size are selected to
provide reasonable simulation times. Reducing the first two by an order
of magnitude did not significantly change the results. Reducing the
inclination step size by an order of magnitude resulted in an observable
increase in the time to Kessler Syndrome but did not change the relative
times between cases. LC satellites typically range from 3 to 10 year
predicted lifetimes; 5 years is selected as a representative value. The
ODMSP \[16\] requires that LC satellites have a 90% probability of
successful post mission disposal with a goal of 99%. The 5% failure rate
(95% success rate) is chosen to be in the middle of this range. The
small constellation factor is discussed in Section 2.4.5 and avoidance
failure rate in Section 2.4.2. Sensitivity analysis was not preformed
with respect to the last 4 parameters.

The baseline case does not result in a Kessler Syndrome after 100 years.
Tab. 3 shows the time to Kessler syndrome (years) for the remaining 145
cases. There are twenty-nine rows for the configurations and 5 columns
for the number of satellites per orbit. The Satellite Size/Orbit columns
indicate which orbits are populated for each configuration and with
which size satellites: S - small (15 kg), M - medium (250 kg), or L -
large (500 kg). For example, the Configuration 1 / 10K case is 10,000
small satellites in 450-km orbits, for that case a Kessler Syndrome did
not occur within 100 years. Another example, the Configuration 22 / 30K
case is 30,000 small satellites in 450-km orbits and 30,000 medium
satellites in 600-km orbits, that case results in Kessler Syndrome in
23.4 years.

It is seen that the number of satellites, the satellite size, and the
orbit altitude all matter. None of the cases consisting of only small
(15-kg) satellites experiences a Kessler Syndrome within 100 years. This
includes the 150,000-satellite case with 50,000 satellites in each
orbit. The cases with at least 30,000 medium (250-kg) satellites in the
600-km or 1,200-km orbits experience a Kessler Syndrome within 25 years.
The cases with at least 10,000 large (500-kg) satellites in the 600-km
or 1,200-km orbits experience a Kessler Syndrome within 12.5 years.

Configurations 28 and 29 are interesting. In Configuration 28, small
satellites (15-kg) are maintained in the 450-km orbit and large
satellites (500-kg) in the 1,2000-km orbit. In Configuration 29, the
sizes are reversed, large in 450km and small in 1,200-km. In both
configurations, medium satellites are maintained in the 600-km orbit.
The time to Kessler Syndrome for of the numbers of satellites per orbit
is from 3 to over 10 times longer for the Configuration 29 cases. All
these cases have the same number of satellites and the same total mass
in orbit. The only difference is the switch of which orbits the small
and large satellites occupy. Clearly, the larger satellites in lower
orbit are safer than the larger satellites in higher orbit.

Four cases are explored in more detail. The baseline case in Section
3.1, the 150,000 small satellite case in Section 3.2, the 30,000 medium
satellite 600-km orbit case in Section 3.3, and the 10,000 large
satellite 1,200-km orbit case in Section 3.4.\*\*\*TABLE 3 OMITTED\*\*\*

3.1 Baseline Case

The time evolution of the baseline case is shown in Fig. 5. The
maneuverable (active) satellites (solid lines) completely decay due to
the 5-year lifetime model and post mission disposal of maneuverable
satellites. The number of rocket bodies (dash-dot-dash line) decreases
due to drag and collisions. The number of non-maneuverable (passive)
satellites (dashed lines) deceases initially due to decay at the lower
altitudes and then stabilizes. The debris (dotted lines) are observed to
grow exponentially with an approximately 6-year time constant until the
active satellites decay, and then at a much slower rate (approximately
100-year time constant). \*\*\*FIGURE 5 OMITTED\*\*\*

Fig. 6 compares the object fluxes at the start of simulation and at the
end, 100 years later. After 100 years, debris growth has increased the
number of objects in the orbits that had the higher object
concentrations.

The evolution of objects by altitude in the baseline case is shown in
Fig. 7. An interesting feature is the clear indication of the solar
cycle in the decay below 400 km. It is also interesting to note the
spread of objects into higher orbits over time. As there are no new
launches, the only mechanism for this in the model are fragmentation
events.

3.2 150,000 Small Satellites Case (Configuration 19 / 50K)

In this case the LCs consist of 50,000 small satellites in the 450-km
orbits, 50,000 small satellites in the 600-km orbits, and 50,000 small
satellites in the 1,200-km orbits, for a total of 150,000 satellites.
After 100 years, there is little difference in object distribution by
orbit compared to the baseline (no new launches) case, as shown in Fig.
8. The additional objects around 1,200 km are from the operational
satellites at that orbit, the debris spread around that orbit, and the
non-maneuverable satellites decaying from that orbit.

height="1.186930227471566in"}

3.3 30,000 Medium Satellite at 600-km Orbit Case (Configuration 5 / 30K)

In this case the LC consists of 30,000 medium satellites in the 600-km
orbits. The result is a Kessler Syndrome in slightly more than 22 years,
consuming the satellites in that orbit and creating millions of debris
objects. The evolution of the object classes in shown in Fig. 9. The SMM
curve jumps to 30,000 at time zero and continues at that level until
just before the Kessler Syndrome when the satellites are consumed by the
debris. Fragmentation of LC satellites that lose maneuverability due to
failures or small object collisions cause the increase in the SNM curve.
Fragments from these non-maneuverable satellites as they experience
collisions result in the increases of the DL, DM, and DS curves. The
approximately 11,000 lethal debris objects at time zero grows to over 33
million at the start of Kessler Syndrome.

The debris evolution by altitude is shown in Fig. 10. The spike in
debris around 600-km leading to the Kessler Syndrome is apparent.

**[An interesting question]{.underline}** raised by these results -
**[when is the tipping point]{.underline}**? Additional simulations were
run to address this question for the 30,000 medium satellites in the
600-km orbit case. The previous results showed a Kessler Syndrome
occurring in 22 years. Stopping launches after year 15 was found to
reliably avoid a Kessler Syndrome within the 100-year simulation time.

Fig. 11 compares the object evolution for the continuous launch and the
launch stop after 15 years cases. Note that the time scales are
different. The continuous launch case plot ends at the time of Kessler
Syndrome while the stop after 15 years case plot continues for 100
years.

As shown in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13, stopping launches after 20 years delays
the Kessler Syndrome by 4 years but does not prevent it - the tipping
point has been reached.

**[In this case the LC consists]{.underline}** **[of 10,000
satellites]{.underline}** **[in the 1,200-km orbit]{.underline}**.
**[The result is a Kessler Syndrome in 10 years]{.underline}**. The

tens of millions), can easily become a major catastrophe, and even a
systemic threat to society.

Societal Impacts of Severe Space Weather and Solar Flares

**[Space weather events]{.underline}** have been
**[associated]{.underline}** **[with a [multitude of
negative]{.mark}]{.underline}**, mainly
**[technological]{.underline}**[, **[direct]{.underline}** economic
**[consequences such as blocked radio]{.underline}**
**[communications]{.underline}**,]{.mark}
**[[sat]{.underline}]{.mark}**ellite **[[damage]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and malfunctions, **[[disruption to]{.mark} rail networks]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[wireless [networks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and
global navigation systems such as GPS (Cannon et al. 2013; Eroshenko et
al. 2010). However, **[the most]{.underline}**
**[consequential]{.underline}** possible **[effect is [extensive]{.mark}
damage]{.underline}** **[to electricity]{.underline}**
**[transformers]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** therefore
potentially [**[long-term disruption]{.underline}**
**[to]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the electricity]{.underline}**
**[[transmission infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Khurshid et al.
2020; Kappenman 2012). Such a disruption would cause severe problems
with the supply of many basic services, including the access to pumped
potable water, and the loss of all perishable foods and medications that
depend on refrigeration (National Research Council 2009; Kappenman
2012).

[The observed history of space weather in modern economies is very
limited.]{.mark} The biggest geomagnetic storm of the last few decades
happened in 1989 and caused transformer damage in multiple countries and
an approximately 9 h-long power outages for over 6 million inhabitants
of Quebec (Lakhina et al. 2004; Barnes and Van Dyke 1990).

The most severe directly observed events were the storms of 1859 (the
Carrington Event) and 1921, which were roughly three times as powerful
as the 1989 event and are typically considered to be a 1 in a 100-year
events (Kappenman 2010). However, since economies at the time were not
so dependent on electricity (especially, of course, in 1859), the impact
of both these events was much less severe than the impacts of the 1989
event and consisted mostly of disruption to the telegraph service
(Boteler 2006).

**[While these]{.underline}** historical **[events are associated
only]{.underline}** **[with]{.underline}** **[relatively]{.underline}**
mild societal **[impacts]{.underline}**, **[a [similar
event]{.mark}]{.underline}** today **[would [have severe]{.mark} global
[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Many of the studies attempting to
analyse the future potential impacts of such an event focus on the
economic effects associated with major power outages. A study by
Kappenman (2010) estimates that a Carrington storm hitting the United
States could put more than 200 large power transformers at risk of
permanent damage and cause severe damages to the power grid, leading to
long-lasting (months or potentially years) blackouts for approximately
130 million people in the US and a full recovery time of 4--10 years.
The total cost of a long-term power outage affecting a significant area
is estimated at USD 1--2 trillion during the first year (National
Research Council 2009).

In a report for Lloyd's, Maynard et al. (2013) points out that the
duration of the power outage depends largely on the availability of
spare transformers. These authors estimate that, in the worst-case
scenario of no spare transformers, a Carrington-like event would lead to
a power outage in the US affecting 20--40 million people and lasting 5
months. [They estimate an associated economic loss of USD 0.5--2.6
trillion.Footnote2]{.mark}

[Moran et al. (2014) analyse the economic impacts of space weather from
a global perspective and conclude that "a severe space-weather event
could be the worst natural disaster in modern history" (p. 8).]{.mark}
Assuming a power outage lasting 1 year for an event of a magnitude
between the 1989 storm and the Carrington event (with annual probability
of occurrence likely to be higher than 1%), the authors conclude [a
major disruption of global supply chains affecting all industries and
estimate a global economic loss of up to USD 3.4 trillion (5.6% of
global GDP) in the first year.]{.mark}

Oughton et al. (2016) find that an [extended power outage in the US
caused by a similar space weather event would lead to global economic
losses with respect to global supply chain disruptions valued at USD
0.5--2.7 trillion.]{.mark} Using a globally integrated economic model to
account for the post-event dynamic responses of global trade, they
estimate a decrease of global GDP by up to USD 1.1 trillion over a
five-year period. The economic loss to the US manufacturing industry is
estimated to be USD 350 billion with approximately half of the losses
being indirect (roughly equally split between the losses associated with
upstream and downstream disruptions to the supply chain). The losses to
the US insurance industry are estimated to be up to USD 334 billion,
with 90% of the losses caused by service interruption within property
insurance policies.

[In another paper, Oughton et al. (2017) suggest that a severe
geomagnetic storm, causing a power outage for 66% of the population in
the US, would create a daily economic loss of USD 41.5 billion.
Approximately half of the total economic loss is estimated to be
inflicted indirectly outside of the blackout zone due to supply chain
disruptions; Moran et al. (2014) reach similar conclusion for the global
economy.]{.mark}

[Oughton et al. (2019) estimate an economic impact of a significant
geomagnetically-induced power grid failure]{.mark} in the UK and
distinguish between scenarios in terms of the ability to forecast the
event. They find that a 1 in a 100-year event with the current level of
forecasting [would cause a GDP loss of GBP 2.9 billion]{.mark} in the
UK, but an enhanced forecasting ability based on further investment in
this technology would bring the loss down significantly, to GBP 0.9
billion.

In all these modelling exercises, **[power outages]{.underline}** for a
significant portion of the population are **[assumed to lead to
cascading effects over many sectors]{.underline}**. National Research
Council (2009) emphasised banking and finance, government services and
emergency response. Eventually, however[, all economic sectors would be
adversely affected]{.mark} (Moran et al. 2014; Riley et al. 2018). Apart
from the sectoral vulnerability to power outages due to the reliance on
electricity, Moran et al. (2014) note that [the global economic
production system today is made even more vulnerable due to the common
use of practices such as just-]{.mark}in-time production, reduced
inventories, and increased reliance on long-distance supply chains with
many links.

More difficult to model, but maybe not less important to evaluate, is
the public response to such an event. Hapgood et al. (2021) suggest that
a power grid disruption caused by a severe space weather event would
lead to panic buying and stockpiling of essential goods such as petrol,
bottled water, non-perishable foods, and toilet paper. There could be
various flow-on effects from this panic. [Ultimately, the longer-term
economic consequences of that are unclear.]{.mark}

[It is uncontroversial that an extended power outage for a significant
portion of the population would lead to disastrous economic
impacts.]{.mark} However, the potential of space weather events of the
magnitudes discussed above to cause such extended power outages are
questioned by studies such as NERC (2010, 2012) and Cannon et al.
(2013). They argue that extensive power grid hardware damage is
unlikely, and the more probable consequence is a temporary system
collapse due to voltage instability. In their view, this will result in
only short-term stoppages in electricity supply and thus modest economic
consequences.

Superflares

Research focusing on the risk of even more severe space weather events
is scarce, partially because there have so far been no direct
observations of "superflares" in our solar system. Some evidence
suggests that a superflare 100 times stronger than the Carrington event
may have happened in AD 775 (Melott and Thomas 2012; Usoskin et al.
2013; Mekhaldi et al. 2015) and may have led to regional changes in the
Earth's surface temperature (Sukhodolov et al. 2017). The nature of this
AD 775 event, however, is inconclusive (Cliver et al. 2014; Stephenson
2015; Neuhäuser and Neuhäuser 2015). Another extremely powerful event
possibly happened in AD 993 (Miyake et al. 2013; Mekhaldi et al. 2015).
Furthermore, astronomical observations of other sun-like stars in our
galaxy suggest that such events are indeed possible (Maehara et al.
2012; Nogami et al. 2014).

Lingam and Loeb (2017a) propose that the most powerful
**[superflares]{.underline}** might have **[been [the cause
of]{.mark}]{.underline}** some of the **[[previous]{.mark} mass
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[events]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} that a very rare
**[superflare]{.underline}** with energy 100,000 times **[larger
than]{.underline}** the **[Carrington]{.underline}** event might **[be
able to destroy the ozone layer]{.underline}** **[and lead to
widespread]{.underline}** [**[destruction of ecosystems]{.underline}**
**[with]{.underline}**]{.mark} potentially **[[existential
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In [a follow-up paper, Lingam and
Loeb (2017b) suggest that the societal vulnerability to superflares in
terms of economic damage is increasing rapidly, due to the growth of
technological infrastructure. They propose a mitigation strategy of
setting up a protective shield between the Earth and the Sun to avoid
these dire consequences.]{.mark}

**[We live in "a time of]{.underline}** **[profound
transformations]{.underline}** **[to our global context]{.underline}**,"
stressed Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World
Economic Forum, during the presentation of the Global Risks Report
2015,4 in Davos, Switzerland. **[[For]{.underline}]{.mark}** him,
mankind faces the accelerated effects of climate change and the
increasing uncertainty about the global geopolitical context. Going
further, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Science and Security
Board, in a recent analysis, pointed out that " in 2015, **[unchecked
climate change, global]{.underline}** **[nuclear weapons modernization,
and out-sized]{.underline}** **[nuclear]{.underline}** weapons
**[arsenals]{.underline}** **[pose]{.underline}** extraordinary and
**[undeniable [threats to]{.mark} the continued [existence]{.mark} of
humanity]{.underline}**."5 That led its Doomsday Clock to be advanced by
two minutes. Today it marks three minutes to midnight, the moment of the
Earth\'s collapse.

There are many other reports and studies alerting to this catastrophe.
Such an immeasurable disaster on Earth may affect all space activities,
and their legal achievements. **[While]{.underline}**
**[focusing]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}** **[outer
space]{.underline}** and space activities, **[international space law
can be considered not only a probable]{.underline}**
**[victim]{.underline}** **[of this disaster, but also]{.underline}**
**[an]{.underline}** **[important instrument capable of preventing it.
[The]{.mark}]{.underline}** fundamental 1967
**[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**uter **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**pace
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty,6 as its Preamble points out, **[is
inspired " by the great prospects opening up for humanity as a result of
man's entry into outer space" and recognizes " the common interest of
all mankind in the progress of exploration and use of]{.underline}**
outer **[space for]{.underline}** **[peaceful purposes]{.underline}**."

This obviously means that **[the]{.underline}** **[fate of
humanity]{.underline}** **[is in the core of its
attention]{.underline}**. This paper attempts to demonstrate the ability
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the need for international space law to
face the critical situation of the Earth in extreme danger, including
the legal examination and the use of juridical provisions presented in
the recommendations of the main scientific documents already drawn up on
this transcendental subject. In conclusion, some **[viable [initiatives
in]{.mark} the [space law]{.mark}]{.underline}** field
**[are]{.underline}** proposed as **[[contribut]{.mark}ions to efforts
to provide Earth with [new guarantees of
survival]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

I. The Preventive Function of Law

The paper's proposals raise the opportunity and the need to expand the
scope and the objectives of international space law, including in it
specific space issues of the Earth and of its life expressions.
Furthermore, it is timely to underline that " in today's world, the
preventive function of law is more vital than ever," as observed Manfred
Lachs (1914-1993) about 28 years ago. For him, it would be necessary for
men around the world to feel this reality, " in order to incite them to
abandon something of the parish spirit and give them the feeling of the
existence of a common interest, and of responsibility in application of
law in the everyday life of nations, as well as to make them understand
that, as usually is said, it is worth more act wisely together than
commit follies separately," At the same time, as a notable jurist and
thinker, Lachs foresaw the dangers that the Earth is currently
experiencing: "Today, it is required to work at a time when science and
technology have placed in man's hands weapons capable of creating a
danger to life and even cause total destruction; when modern techniques
create other dangers threatening the earth, water and air; [when
economic and political relations between the states require that a new
order abolishes abyss between rich and hungry \[\...\]" .7 If the world
already was in great danger in the 1980s, what could be the magnitude of
danger today?]{.mark}

II, Poly-Catastrophe

"Dark times \[\...\] are not only not new, they are not a rarity in
history," as Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) observed.8 But today we are
certainly living in often darker times. According to the Global
Solidarity, Global Responsibility: An Appeal for World Governance -
launched in Geneva, Switzerland, on 6 March 2012, and endorsed by the
Collegium International members

> \"[**[we are facing a]{.underline}** **[conjunction of global
> crises]{.underline}** **[that are]{.underline}** **[unprecedented in
> history: depletion of]{.underline}** **[natural resources,
> irreversible]{.underline}** **[destruction of biodiversity, disruption
> of the global]{.underline}** **[financial system, dehumanization of

> **[['poly-catastrophe']{.underline}]{.mark}** \[\...\]"

The Appeal stresses that " the great crises of the 21st century are
planetary," and that **[" this is no butterfly effect, but the
realization,]{.underline}** **[grave and strong, that our common home is
in danger of]{.underline}** **[collapsing]{.underline}** **[and that our
salvation can only be collective]{.underline}**."9

III\. Our World Today

The new Global Sustainable Development Goals - Transforming our World:
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development10 - have been adopted by
Heads of State and Government and High Representatives, during the
meeting at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York from 25-27
September 2015 - with the UN celebrating its 70th anniversary. Paragraph
14 of this historic document presents the vision of the UN General
Assembly (UNGA) on the world global situation today, as follows: "We are
meeting at a time of immense challenges to sustainable development.
Billions of our citizens continue to live in poverty and are denied a
life of dignity. There are rising inequalities within and among
countries. There are enormous disparities of opportunity, wealth and
power. Gender inequality remains a key challenge. Unemployment,
particularly youth unemployment, is a major concern. **[Global health
threats, more frequent and intense [natural disasters]{.mark},
spiraling]{.underline}** **[[conflict]{.mark}, violent]{.underline}**
**[extremism, [terror]{.mark}ism and related humanitarian
crises]{.underline}** **[and forced displacement of people threaten to
[reverse]{.mark} much of the]{.underline}** development
**[[progress]{.mark} made in recent decades. Natural resource depletion
and adverse impacts of]{.underline}** **[environmental degradation,
including desertification, drought, land degradation, freshwater
scarcity and loss of biodiversity, add to and exacerbate the list
of]{.underline}** **[challenges]{.underline}** which **[humanity faces.
Climate change is one of the]{.underline}** **[greatest challenges of
our time]{.underline}** and its adverse impacts undermine the ability of
all countries to achieve sustainable development. Increases in global
temperature, sea level rise, ocean acidification and other climate
change impacts are seriously affecting coastal areas and low-lying
coastal countries, including many least developed countries and small
island developing States. **[The]{.underline}** **[[survival
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** many societies, and of the biological support
systems of [**[the planet, are at risk]{.underline}**."]{.mark}

" Climate change will amplify existing risks and create new risks for
natural and human systems. Risks are unevenly distributed and are
generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries
at all levels of development," as Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) says in Climate Change 2014 - Synthesis Report - Summary
for Policymakers.11

IV\. Care for Our Common Home

Pope Francis in his 2015 Encyclical Letter Laudato Si \~ On Care for Our
Common Home - issued in 25 May - makes an " urgent appeal for a new
dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet." According
to Pope, "we require a new and universal solidarity," as " our present
situation is in many ways unprecedented in the history of humanity."

**[" The Earth]{.underline}**, our home," - he stresses - " **[is
beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of
filth]{.underline}**," because " **[each year hundreds of millions
of]{.underline}** **[tons of waste]{.underline}** **[are generated, much
of it non-biodegradable, highly toxic and radioactive, from homes and
businesses, from construction and demolition sites, from clinical,
electronic and industrial sources]{.underline}**."

Pope Francis also warns:

> "A very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently
> witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system \[\...} most of
> global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of
> greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others)
> released mainly as a result of human activity \[\...\] The problem is
> aggravated by a model of development based on the intensive use of
> fossil fuels, which is at the heart of the worldwide energy system.
> Another determining factor has been an increase in changed uses of the
> soil, principally deforestation for agricultural purposes."
>
> "Warming has effects on the carbon cycle. It creates a vicious circle
> which aggravates the situation even more, affecting the availability
> of essential resources like drinking water, energy and agricultural
> production in warmer regions, and leading to the extinction of part of
> the planet's biodiversity. If present trends continue, this century
> may well witness extraordinary climate change and an unprecedented
> destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequences for all of us,"
> as " climate change is a global problem with grave implications:
> environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of
> goods."

Moreover, Pope Francis remarks:

> "We all know that it is not possible to sustain the present level of
> consumption in developed countries and wealthier sectors of society,
> where the habit of wasting and discarding has reached unprecedented
> levels. The exploitation of the planet has already exceeded acceptable
> limits and we still have not solved the problem of poverty. "
>
> "Caring for ecosystems demands far-sightedness, since no one looking
> for quick and easy profit is truly interested in their preservation.
> But the cost of the damage caused by such selfish lack of concern is
> much greater than the economic benefits to be obtained," points out
> Pope Francis, And he adds that " the alliance between the economy and
> technology ends up sidelining anything unrelated to its immediate
> interests."
>
> "The failure of global summits on the environment makes it plain that
> our politics are subject to technology and finance. [There are too
> many special interests, and economic interests easily end up trumping
> the common good and manipulating information so that their own plans
> will not be affected."]{.mark}
>
> " It is foreseeable that, once certain resources have been depleted,
> the scene will be set for new wars, albeit under the guise of noble
> claims. War always does grave harm to the environment and to the
> cultural riches of peoples, risks which are magnified when one
> considers nuclear arms and biological weapons \[\...\] Politics must
> pay greater attention to foreseeing new conflicts and addressing the
> causes which can lead to them. But powerful financial interests prove
> most resistant to this effort, and political planning tends to lack
> breadth of vision." 52

Wouldn't these observations also applicable to outer space?

V. The Tragedy f Common Goods

To explain how we arrived to it at current bad situation of the common
resources of Earth, Eduardo Felipe P. Matias recalls the article Tragedy
of Common Goods, written in 1968 by American ecologist Garrett Hardin
(1915-2003). Hardin recounts the case of a village of shepherds, whose
sheep used a pasture in common. Each shepherd was engaged in putting
more and more sheep in the pasture in order to increase his income. Over
time, the pasture was saturated, and there was no pasture left to feed
all the sheep. Most of them died. In sum, a tragedy. The shepherds
abused the common good to increase their individual gains, ignoring the
limits of nature. Although they gained more in short term, they lost out
in long run. Already in 1999, it was recognized that " a globalized
world requires a theory of global public goods to achieve crucial goals
such as financial stability, human security or the reduction of
environmental pollution." And that "many of today's international crises
have their roots in a serious under supply of global public goods." 13

As to global human security as a public good, the 1994 Human Development
Report has showed [threats to world peace in transborder challenges:
unchecked population growth, disparities in economic opportunities,
environmental degradation, excessive international migration, narcotics
production and trafficking and international terrorism,"]{.mark} It was
equally said that the society would be "willing to pay for public goods
that serve our common interest, be they shared systems of environmental
controls, the destruction of nuclear weapons, the control of
transmittable diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS, the preservation of
ethnic conflicts or the reduction of refugee flows," 14

Addressing the present question of common goods in his 2015 Encyclical
Letter, Pope Francis points out:

> "Whether believers or not, we are agreed today that the Earth is
> essentially a shared inheritance, whose fruits are meant to benefit
> everyone. Hence every ecological approach needs to incorporate a
> social perspective which takes into account the fundamental rights of
> the poor and the underprivileged. The principle of the subordination
> of private property to the universal destination of goods, and thus
> the right of everyone to their use, is a golden rule of social conduct
> He also notes that " the natural environment is a collective good, the
> patrimony of all humanity and the responsibility of everyone. If we
> make something our own, it is only to administer it for the good of
> all. If we do not, we burden our consciences with the weight of having
> denied the existence of others."

Antonio Cassese (1937-2011) commented that " the concept of 'common
good' is not yet felt by the members of the international society. Only
state interests and their occasional convergence regulate international
relations." 15 The refugees tragedy in Europe today proves it.

VI\. Uncertainty

According to Klaus Schwab, Executive Chairman of World Economic Forum, "
**[in the coming decade \[\...\] our lives will be even more intensely
shaped by transformative forces that are under way
already]{.underline}**. The effects of climate change are accelerating
and the uncertainty about the global geopolitical context and the
effects it will have on international collaboration will remain. At the
same time, [societies are increasingly under pressure from economic,
political and social developments including rising income inequality,
but also increasing national sentiment]{.mark} \[\...\] \[N\]ew
technologies, such as the Internet or emerging innovations will not bear
fruit if regulatory mechanisms at the international and national levels
cannot be agreed upon."

The Global Risks Report 2015, in turn, stresses: " 2015
**[differs]{.underline}** **[markedly]{.underline}** **[from the past,
with rising]{.underline}** **[technological risks,
notably]{.underline}** **[cyber-attacks, and]{.underline}** [**[new
economic realities, which remind us that geopolitical tensions present
themselves in a]{.underline}** **[very different world
from]{.underline}** **[before.]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[Information]{.underline}** **[flows instantly around the
globe and emerging technologies have boosted the influence
of]{.underline}** new players and **[new types of warfare]{.underline}**
\[\...\] **[Past warnings]{.underline}** **[of potential environmental
catastrophes have begun to be borne out, yet insufficient
progress]{.underline}** **[has been made]{.underline}** - as reflected
in the high concerns about failure of climate-change adaptation and
looming water crises in this year's report."

The Report sees three risk constellations that bear out its findings:

> [" 1) The **[interconnections between geopolitics and economics are
> intensifying because States are making greater use of economic
> tools]{.underline}**,]{.mark} from regional integration and trade
> treaties to protectionist policies and cross-border investments[,

**[How to]{.underline}** **[govern]{.underline}** the **[emerging
tech]{.underline}**nologies and uncertainties?

VII\. The Doomsday Clock

It is a symbolic clock face, marking countdown to doomsday. On 19
January 2015, it went on to score 23:57h, three minutes to midnight -
the time of global catastrophe able to extinguish the human species
inhabiting the Earth for many thousands of years. The decision to
advance the clock by two minutes was taken after consultations with more
than 20 scientists, including 17 Nobel laureates, among them famous
physicists, such as the British Stephen Hawking, the Japanese Masatoshi
Koshiba, pioneer in the study of neutrinos, and the American Leon
Lederman. The clock has been maintained since 1947 - when the Cold War
between the USA and the former USSR began - by the members of the
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Science and Security Board. In 68
years, this sui generis indicator has been adjusted 22 times. Its worst
moment came in 1953, triggered by American and Soviet tests with
hydrogen weapons when the Clock scored 23:58h.

The Clock was conceived by the celebrated Chicago Atomic Scientists,
that had actively participated in the Manhattan Project in the creation
of the atomic bombs launched over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in
August 1945. Haunted with these bombings - that killed more than 100,000
people just on the first day, and many more in the following months -
they started to publish a mimeographed warning newsletter and then the
Bulletin. The closer they set the Clock to midnight, the closer the
scientists believe the world is to a global disaster.

The Clock hangs on a wall in a Bulletin\'s office in the University of
Chicago. Originally, it represented an analogy to the threat of global
nuclear war. But since 2007 it has also reflected climate change, and
new developments in the life sciences and technology that could inflict
irrevocable harm to humanity.

The analysis of the Bulletin - addressed "to the leaders and citizens of
the world" - says in sum: " In 2015, unchecked climate change, global
nuclear weapons modernizations, and out-sized nuclear weapons arsenals
pose extraordinary and undeniable threats to the continued existence of
humanity." The group said in a statement: " \[Wjorld leaders have failed
to act with the speed or on the scale required to protect citizens from
potential catastrophe. These failures of political leadership endanger
every person on Earth." In 2014, with the Doomsday Clock at five minutes
to midnight, the members of the Science and Security Board concluded
their assessment of the world security situation by writing: "**[We
can]{.underline}** **[manage]{.underline}** our
**[tech]{.underline}**nology, **[or become]{.underline}** **[victims of
it]{.underline}**. **[The choice is ours, and]{.underline}** **[the
Clock is ticking."]{.underline}**

In 2015, with the Clock hand moved forward to three minutes to midnight,
the Bulletin feels compelled to add, with a sense of great urgency:
"**[The probability of]{.underline}** **[global
catastrophe]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** **[very high, and the
actions needed to reduce the risks of disaster must be taken very
soon]{.underline}**."

In face of the dangers affecting today civilization on a global scale,
the Bulletin urges the citizens of the world to demand that their
leaders, among other measures, \"dramatically reduce proposed spending
on nuclear weapons modernization programs" , as " the USA and Russia
have hatched plans to essentially rebuild their entire nuclear triads in
coming decades, and other countries with nuclear weapons are following
suit."

At the start of 2015, nine States - the USA, Russia, the United Kingdom,
France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (North Korea) - possessed about 15,850 nuclear weapons, of
which 4,300 were deployed with operational forces. Roughly 1800 of these
weapons are kept in a state of high operational alert, according to the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Launched on 15
June 2015, the SIPRI Yearbook 2015, which assesses the current state of
armament, disarmament and international security, notes as one of its
key findings that " all the nuclear weapon-possessing states are working
to develop new nuclear weapon systems and/or upgrade their existing
ones." 16

"There are too many nuclear weapons," said Sharon Squassoni, an expert
in nuclear weapons nonproliferation at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington, USA. And she added: "The existence
of these weapons takes a lot of time, effort, and money to keep them
safe, and the bureaucracies are poised to keep these systems going
indefinitely." 17

For Hans M Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at
the Federation of American Scientists, " the projected costs of the
nuclear weapons modernization program are indefensible, and they
undermine the global disarmament regime." 18

That is why another demand from Bulletin, addressed to world leaders, is
to " re-energize the disarmament process." In practice it means that "
the USA and Russia, in particular, need to start negotiations on
shrinking their strategic and tactical nuclear arsenals."

The creation of " institutions specifically assigned to explore and
address potentially catastrophic misuses of new technologies," is also a
requirement proposed by the Bulletin.

The Bulletin's appeals are also, to some extent, applicable to outer
space, and some of its requirements can be objects of proper regulation
by international space law.

VIII\. Transparency and Confidence

**[The Earth being in danger, the]{.underline}** transparency and
confidence-building measures (**[[TCBMs]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
**[[are]{.mark} as [vital as]{.mark} those of [collective
security]{.mark}. These actions are means by which Governments [can
share info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}** **[aiming at
[creating]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[mutual
understanding]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and]{.underline}** **[trust,
[reducing]{.mark}]{.underline}** misconceptions and
**[[miscalc]{.mark}ulations and [thereby]{.mark} helping both
to]{.underline}** **[[prevent military
confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and to foster]{.underline}**
regional and **[global stability. They played an important role during
the Cold War, contributing to reducing the risk of armed conflict
through mitigating misunderstandings]{.underline}** on military actions,
particularly in situations where States lacked clear and timely
information.19 **[The need for such measures in outer space activities
has increased significantly over the past 20 years, The world's growing
[dependence on space]{.mark}-based systems and
tech]{.underline}**nologies **[and the]{.underline}**
**[info]{.underline}**rmation **[they provide]{.underline}**
**[[requires collaborative effort]{.mark}s to address threats to the
sustainability and security of]{.underline}** **[outer space activities.
TCBMs " can]{.underline}** reduce, or even **[eliminate]{.underline}**,
misunderstandings, mistrust and **[miscalculations]{.underline}**
**[with regard to the activities and intentions of States in outer
space"]{.underline}** , This is the conclusion of the Report of the
Group of Governmental Experts on TCBMs in Outer Space Activities - a
study adopted by consensus and issued on 29 July 2013.20

The Report adds that " **[these measures can augment the safety,
sustainability and security of day-to-day space
operations]{.underline}** **[and can contribute both to the development
of mutual understanding and to the strengthening of friendly relations
between States and peoples."]{.underline}**

It is acknowledged that " the existing treaties on outer space contain
several TCBMs of a mandatory nature. Non-legally binding measures for
outer space activities should complement the existing international
legal framework on space activities and should not undermine existing
legal obligations or ham per the lawful use of outer space, particularly
by emerging space actors." The Group also discussed other measures,
including those of a legally binding nature. The Group further agreed
that " such measures for outer space activities could [contribute to,
but not act as a substitute for, measures to monitor the implementation
of arms limitation and disarmament agreements," help States to enhance
clarity of their peaceful intentions and create conditions for
establishing a predictable strategic situation in both the economic and
security arenas.]{.mark}

Similarly, included in the Report were \"coordination and consultative
mechanisms aimed at improving interaction between participants in outer
space activities and clarifying information and ambiguous situations."
Likewise the Report recommended a coordination between the Office for
Disarmament Affairs, the Office for Outer Space Affairs (OOSA) and other
appropriate UN entities. Moreover, the Report drafted " a series of
measures for outer space activities, including exchange of information
relating to national space policy such as major military expenditure in
outer space, notifications of outer space activities aimed at risk
reduction, and visits to space launch sites and facilities."

The Group took note of the "Guidelines for appropriate types of
confidencebuilding measures and for the implementation of such measures
on a global or regional level" , as contained in the " Study on the
application of confidence- building measures in outer space"21

TCBMs for outer space activities are integrated in a broader context.
The UN General Assembly endorsed, in its resolution 43/78 H, the
guidelines on confidence- building measures adopted by the Disarmament
Commission at its 1988 session. This resolution noted that "
confidence-building measures, while neither a substitute nor a
precondition for arms limitation and disarmament measures, can be
conducive to achieving progress in disarmament" .

The Report indicates the following categories of TCBMs for space
activities as relevant: " a) General transparency and
confidence-building measures aimed at enhancing the availability of
information on the space policy of States involved in outer space
activities; b) **[Information exchange]{.underline}** **[about
development programs for]{.underline}** **[new space
systems]{.underline}**, as well as information about operational
space-based systems providing widely used services such as
meteorological observations or global positioning, navigation and
timing; c) The articulation of a State's principles and goals relating
to their exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes; d)
Specific information-exchange measures aimed at expanding the
availability of information on objects in outer space and their general
function, particularly those objects in Earth orbits; e) Measures
related to establishing norms of behavior for promoting spaceflight
safety such as launch notifications and consultations that aim at
avoiding potentially harmful interference, limiting orbital debris and
mini mizing the risk of collisions with other space objects; f)
**[International cooperation measures in outer space activities,
including measures aimed at]{.underline}** promoting
**[capacity-building]{.underline}** and disseminating [data for
sustainable economic and social development, that are **[consistent with
existing international commitments and
obligations.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

In fact, **[[some]{.mark} TCBMs for outer space activities have
[already]{.mark} been [enacted]{.mark}]{.underline}** at the
multilateral and/or the national level. **[They include pre-launch
notifications, space situational awareness data-sharing, notifications
of hazards to spaceflight safety and other significant events, and the
publication of national space policies.]{.underline}** **[[But]{.mark}
they [need to be]{.mark} further [developed]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

IX\. Common Law of Mankind and Earth

**[More than ever, it is time to think big.]{.underline}** International
space law is usually defined as dealing with outer space, celestial
bodies - Moon and asteroids, Mars and other planets as well as with the
space activities which so far are carried out only by the human species
from the planet Earth, However, the very specific situation of Earth as
celestial body responsible for the creation and development of the
international space law is not taken into the due consideration. Earth
is not recognized as one of the main objectives of this branch of law.

Ironically, in this context, we could say that the international space
law takes care of the solar system and the universe as a whole, minus of
Earth, although it is the cradle of the exploration and use of outer
space in general, and, therefore, of international space law.

Let's take just two examples. "At its broadest, space law comprises all
the law that may govern or apply to outer space and activities in and
relating to outer space," write Francis Lyall and Paul B. Larsen.22 In
the same sense, the Education Curriculum of Space Law, adopted by United
Nations Office For Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), on March, 2014, states
that " space law can be described as the body of law applicable to and
governing space related activities."23

Nevertheless, the **[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**uter
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**pace **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty, of
1967, **[[has]{.underline}]{.mark}**, at least, two **[[extremely
important norms for]{.mark} the security of [Earth]{.mark} and its
inhabitants [in Article]{.mark}]{.underline}**s IV and
**[[IX]{.underline}]{.mark}**, respectively: 1) "not to place in orbit
around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds
of weapons of mass destruction," and 2) to avoid "harmful contamination
and adverse changes in the environment of the Earth resulting from
introduction of extraterrestrial matter." **[The sky always has played a
crucial role in the evolution of mankind and all life manifestations on
Earth. However, today the importance of outer space to our
planet]{.underline}** **[and its]{.underline}** **[common
life]{.underline}** **[has]{.underline}** **[increased as never before.
The data coming from [sat]{.mark}ellite[s are]{.mark} absolutely
[fundamental for]{.mark} any efforts to assure the
[sustainability]{.mark} of Earth and all its life expressions. In this
global reality it is]{.underline}** **[sheer recklessness
to]{.underline}** **[ignore the imperative of protecting our planet and
its population]{.underline}**, based on inclusive international space
legislation. Hence the necessity of a Common Law of Mankind24 and Earth,
specially related with international space law.

More and more, **[outer space]{.underline}**
**[protection]{.underline}**25 **[must be seen as]{.underline}** an
**[indispensable]{.underline}** factor **[to]{.underline}** **[Earth
protection]{.underline}**, and vice-verse. As the globalization of
Earth - with the interdependence of physical, social and political
events - is more than ever recognized as an undeniable fact, the
universalization of outer space {its cosmic reach), with the
interconnection of everything with everything, cannot be bypassed, as it
has been in the past. As Ervin Laszlo remarks, " the reality we call
universe is a seamless whole, evolving over eons of cosmic time and
producing conditions where life, and then mind and consciousness can
emerge."26 Or, as Edgar Morin says, "we carry inside of us all the
cosmos" and "we are all children of the sun."27

X. It Is up to International Space Law

**[[If we are]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[really
[determined]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[to avoid]{.mark} a]{.underline}**
**[[likely apocalypse]{.underline}]{.mark}** visible **[on the horizon,
one of the main tasks of the international space law that we must
trigger is to]{.underline}** **[help save the Earth from space,
using]{.underline}** the **[powerful]{.underline}** scientific and
technological **[resources]{.underline}** **[we have installed
there]{.underline}**.

**[Centuries ago Earth ceased to be the center of the universe, as our
ancestors thought. But in face of unprecedented global dangers that
threaten our planet today, its place cannot be other than the center of
our universal concerns. Probably, a collapse of Earth would deprive the
universe of a specie of intelligent life.]{.underline}**

In reality, as Jonathan Schell (1943-2014) pointed out, " the vision
that counts is the view from Earth, from life," as " from our strategic
position on Earth different view opens, bigger even than the one taken
from space. It is the vision of our children and grandchildren, of all
future generations of mankind, stretching ahead of us into the
future."28

The question, as posed by Antonio Cassese, is that " international
society is still grounded in the mere juxtaposition of its subjects -
not in their solidarity, let alone in their integration." 29

In any event, " from the microbes inhabiting the earth beneath our feet
to environments of the universe unknown to us now, the next 100 years of
ecological discoveries will influence our lives. We enter a time when
society is armed with the scientific knowledge and ability to make
responsible decisions," as a recent editorial of Science affirms.30 And
with " a new human consciousness " , as says Edgar Morin.31

So, **[" the choice is]{.underline}** our: form **[a]{.underline}**
**[global partnership]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}** **[care for
Earth]{.underline}** and one another **[or risk the]{.underline}**
**[destruction of]{.underline}** ourselves and the diversity of
**[life]{.underline}**," according to The Earth Charter.32

The current global situation seems to be so serious that the titanic
work of saving mankind and our planet can be seen as a kind of utopia,
maybe the major utopia of all times. A dream still far from having a
general support. Coincidentally we'll commemorate in 2016 the 500 years
since the English humanist and statesman Thomas More (1478-1535)
published his Utopia„ considered " a playfully serious social critique
to a social reality deadly and tragically grave."33

**[In this context, [it is urgent]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[to build
a]{.underline}** **[positive agenda for]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
**[[international space law]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

forces]{.underline}** **[and fielding new]{.underline}** anti-satellite
**[weapons]{.underline}** **[to hold U.S. and allied
space]{.underline}** **[systems at risk]{.underline}**." Coats'
testimony is complemented by numerous reports and studies by government
and non-governmental organizations like the Defense Intelligence Agency,
the National Air and Space Intelligence Center, the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, and the Secure World Foundation.

**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[has]{.underline}** also [**[been the

**[real-world]{.underline}** **[anti-satellite

released a statement claiming that on April 15th, Russia had conducted a
direct-ascent anti-satellite missile test. Faced with these real
threats, how should NATO respond?

**[[IMPROVE

**[[Collective action]{.mark} by]{.underline}** **[NATO]{.underline}**
**[on outer space]{.underline}** security **[issues [will only
happen]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[when allies]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[reach a [consensus]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[on
the]{.underline}**]{.mark} anti-satellite
**[[threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[As a first step, an]{.underline}**

Assistant Secretary General for Intelligence) **[should]{.underline}**
**[be [directed to develop]{.mark} a]{.underline}**
[**[comprehensive]{.underline}** **[assessment]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[of the]{.underline}** anti-satellite **[threat]{.underline}** to the

Committee) **[receive]{.underline}** regular **[updates on

**[[MAINSTREAM]{.mark} OUTER [SPACE]{.mark}]{.underline}** AT NATO

**[NATO should]{.underline}** **[[ensure]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[that
[outer space]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[is "mainstreamed" and [fully
integrated]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[within]{.underline}**
**[alliance]{.underline}**]{.mark} political and **[[military
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[and is not treated
as]{.underline}** merely a "**[novelty item]{.underline}**." For
instance, overall **[responsibility]{.underline}** **[for outer
space]{.underline}** **[should be placed in]{.underline}** an
organization like the Office of the Assistant Secretary General for
Defense Policy and Planning, or the Office of the Assistant Secretary
General for Defense Investment, which are responsible for defense
policy, planning, and capability investment at **[NATO]{.underline}**.
Furthermore, noting the interrelationship between outer space and other
domains like nuclear and cyber, NATO will need to establish mechanisms
that encourage effective coordination and cooperation across the entire
organization, including the military commands.

At the operational level, **[the alliance]{.underline}** **[should
ensure that]{.underline}** **[outer space is [incorporated in]{.mark}
its major]{.underline}** military **[[exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[and [wargames]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[This is
[critical]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[because]{.mark}

**[exercises]{.underline}** **[with this in mind]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
Allied Command Transformation, NATO's warfare development command,
should be tasked to make this a reality.

If NATO ever comes into a major conflict with Russia, one of Russia's
first targets would be the alliance's space assets.

**[[ENSURE COOPERATION]{.underline}]{.mark}** AND COORDINATION WITH THE
UNITED STATES

At the end of the day, **[[NATO's]{.mark} ultimate
[effectiveness]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[in outer space]{.underline}**
**[[will depend on]{.mark} its]{.underline}**
**[cooperation]{.underline}** **[with the alliance's]{.underline}**
**[most important space power]{.underline}**:
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. To date, **[U.S.
[leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[has been]{.mark} the [key
driver]{.mark} of NATO]{.underline}** **[decision-making]{.underline}**
**[on outer space]{.underline}**, **[and senior]{.underline}** U.S.
**[officials]{.underline}** **[have actively engaged]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** **[alliance leadership]{.underline}**. For
example, in October 2019, General John Raymond, commander of U.S. Space
Command and chief of space operations, briefed the NATO Military
Committee on outer space security issues. **[These types of
[senior-level engagements]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[between
U.S.]{.underline}** political and **[military leaders
[should]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[continue]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[and be expanded]{.underline}**.

In addition to senior-level engagements, there are a number of other
actions **[[NATO]{.mark} and the]{.underline}**
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
could take to improve cooperation and coordination. Specifically, they
**[[should]{.mark} [establish]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[clear]{.mark}
consultative [mechanisms]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[between
NATO]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[U.S.]{.underline}** **[[Space
Comm]{.underline}]{.mark}**and, **[[and the]{.mark} U.S. [Space
Force]{.mark}]{.underline}**. One relatively easy step that could be
taken quickly would be to **[establish a NATO liaison]{.underline}**
**[officer]{.underline}** **[at U.S. Space Command]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}**/or **[U.S. Space Force
headquarters]{.underline}**. Indeed, a number of allied officers are
currently attached as liaisons at several U.S. combatant commands like
U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM).

**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[should]{.underline}** also **[seek to incorporate]{.underline}**
**[NATO representatives]{.underline}** **[into its outer
space]{.underline}**-**[related]{.underline}**
**[wargames]{.underline}** **[where possible]{.underline}**,
**[especially the Schriever]{.underline}** **[Wargame]{.underline}**,
**[the premier]{.underline}** U.S. **[space wargame]{.underline}**.
According to a U.S. Air Force press release, several allies including
Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and
Japan, have participated in previous Schriever Wargames.
**[The]{.underline}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[should invite]{.mark}
NATO]{.underline}** **[political and]{.underline}** [**[military
officials]{.underline}** **[to participate in the]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[next]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[Schriever
[Wargame]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

COOPERATE WITH THE EU

NATO should also explore ways to cooperate with the EU on outer space,
primarily because the EU has developed and deployed the Galileo global
navigation satellite system, which like the U.S. Global Position System
(GPS), provides accurate positioning and timing information. In
particular, Galileo includes a capability known as the Public Regulated
Service (PRS), an encrypted navigation service for governmental
authorized users and sensitive applications that require high
continuity. In a crisis situation, PRS could provide NATO important
redundancy against an adversary's attempt to jam or destroy GPS. While
many members of NATO are also members of the EU and have access to PRS,
non-EU NATO members, and NATO as an organization, currently does not.
Therefore, NATO should begin consultations with the EU about the
possibility of gaining access to PRS for the alliance.

DON'T FORGET DIPLOMACY

Military solutions alone will not allow the United States and its allies
to address the increasing anti-satellite threat. While I have generally
supported many of the Trump administration's space security initiatives
like the re-establishment of U.S. Space Command, a key element missing
from the Trump administration's outer space security strategy has been
the complete lack of a diplomatic component. Without a more
comprehensive strategy that includes a strong diplomatic element, it
will make it difficult for NATO to maintain enough political cohesion to
pursue effective military policies. These tensions were highlighted in a
recent article that noted: "With the exception of France and the United
Kingdom, many Europeans countries are deeply uncomfortable with, or down
right opposed to, the development and use of weapons in space."

This is not a problem unique to outer space. Throughout its history,
there has been constant tension within NATO over the appropriate balance
between defense and diplomacy in its strategy. Since the late 1960s,
with the approval of the Harmel Report, named after former Belgian
foreign minister Pierre Harmel, NATO has sought to more effectively
balance some of the inherent tensions between defense and diplomacy. One
of the key findings from the Harmel Report was that "military security
and a policy of détente are not contradictory but complementary." Arms
control was considered an essential element of this strategy. The
general Harmel Report approach has shaped the key strategic decisions
that the alliance has taken over the past 50 years, most notably the
"Double-Track" decision in 1979 to deploy intermediate-range nuclear
forces in Western Europe, while simultaneously engaging the Soviet Union
in arms control negotiations.

As part of its overall strategy for outer space, **[NATO should
develop]{.underline}** **[options and recommendations]{.underline}**
**[on how it can advance]{.underline}** **[diplomatic solutions to
address the]{.underline}** **[emerging threat to]{.underline}** outer
**[space systems]{.underline}**. In particular, **[NATO
should]{.underline}** task the Arms Control and Disarmament Committee to
examine what role the alliance could play in
**[develop]{.underline}**ing **[norms of behavior]{.underline}** **[to
encourage]{.underline}** **[responsible use of outer
space]{.underline}**. And even though the Trump administration has
generally been opposed to arms control, it has expressed openness to the
development of norms for outer space. In an recent speech, Assistant
Secretary of State Christopher Ford stated: "**[We]{.underline}**

U.S. LEADERSHIP WILL BE KEY

With the increasing role that outer space is playing in military
operations, and the rise of the anti-satellite threat, NATO was correct
in its decision to declare space as an operational domain in December
2019. The question now is whether the alliance will be able to translate
this broad political guidance into an effective strategy.

An effective NATO strategy for outer space will depend on the ability of
the alliance to build consensus on the threat; mainstream outer space
into NATO's political and military institutions; find ways to cooperate
with the EU; and incorporate diplomacy into that strategy. But at the
end of the day, [**[all of this will]{.underline}** **[require
clear]{.underline}**]{.mark}, sustained, and consistent **[[U.S.
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

## Info Warfare

### 2NC \-- Ext: Info Warfare Link

#### The expansion of information gathering and securing capabilities securitizes the threat of disinformation and militarizes the use of the cyberspace - it justifies crackdowns on "disinformation" that is used to shut down capitalism AND target "demographic bulges" that, according to the US, are perpetrators of extinction - this regime of fear and control re-intrenches society in authoritarianism - turns democracy and makes the threat of extinction inevitable

#### 1 - Information security and its justification is a vehicle for capitalism. Companies use their intel and data to shut down capitalist opposition.

The Post-Cold War, **[global [intelligence
infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}** that grew out of it
**[[was]{.underline}]{.mark}** then **[[applied to]{.mark} a key problem
[big capital]{.mark} faced]{.underline}** after the collapse of the USSR
triggered a global restructuring of production: **[the existence of a
billion-size surplus population]{.underline}**, **[a reserve army of
labour for which no employment was to be expected]{.underline}**.
[**[This]{.underline}**]{.mark} required devising control strategies of
various types. After 9/11, the **[NeoCons]{.underline}**
**[[revived]{.underline}]{.mark}** the War on Terror concept to stir and
then repress segments of this vast reserve army of labour, developing
**[[the notion of Total Information Awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
allow it to **[[know in advance]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[[not
just]{.mark} the intentions of [rival states]{.mark} ranged against the
West or just insufficiently submissive, [but more particularly]{.mark},
the potential [systemic opposition to capitalism]{.mark} at home and
abroad.]{.underline}** Using double agent tactics as well as provocation
and targeted assassination, **[[this]{.mark} has [created the condition
of endless war and a politics of fear]{.mark} sustaining it. Politics
and society today operate]{.underline}** under a permanent state of
exception **[in which [the Internet]{.mark} has been [turned
into]{.mark} [a]{.mark} vast [search engine]{.mark} [on the lookout
for]{.mark} meaningful [opposition]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Meanwhile in
the name of weeding out 'fake news', the big Internet companies such as
**[[Google]{.mark} have [changed]{.mark} their [algorithms to
prevent]{.mark}]{.underline}** Left **[[websites from popping
up]{.underline}]{.mark}** in searches by the public: **[the [World
Socialist Website]{.mark}, [Global Research]{.mark}, and others, have
already experienced sharp declines in]{.underline}** numbers of
**[visitors]{.underline}** (Tveten 2018: 22). Facebook takes orders from
the United States and Israeli governments to remove accounts (Greenwald
2017). Why do these large Internet companies collaborate, and why do
they collaborate with these two governments specifically? That is what I
intend the clarify in the pages that follow.

#### 2 - Turns Case - Securitization of information causes violent regimes of fear and control -- war on terror proves

**Van der Pijl '18** \[Kees; January; Chair of International Relations

Political Economy (CGPE), President of the Committee of Vigilance

**[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}** has **[sought to
[turn its]{.mark} historic [advantage of hosting]{.mark} the world's key
[IT]{.mark} industries [into a competitive
advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Profiting]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[from its military]{.underline}** pre-eminence, its role as the
provider of the world's reserve currency, and enjoying the privilege of
running permanent budget, commercial, and current account deficits,
**[the US worked with the IT firms [to establish a global security
state]{.mark} grounded [in 'Total Information
Awareness']{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[This is [the link between the
surveillance regime]{.mark}]{.underline}** (which includes the voluntary
deposition of personal data in social media) and the War on Terror.
**[[On the basis of]{.mark} its [information]{.mark} advantage, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [keeps global society in a state of
tension]{.mark} by a range of military and intelligence activities
[targeting 'demographic bulges']{.mark}]{.underline}** in the reserve
army of labour. In the process, **[even [risking or provoking acts of
violence]{.mark} against US/Western targets is part of the scenario
because this allows armed control to be imposed. A domestic politics of
fear has been deployed to win public support]{.underline}**.

All **[this was explicitly discussed as a single project in the
Israeli-US NeoCon discussions on a War on Terror]{.underline}**. It was
originally worked out in the early 1980s and revived after the Twin
Towers attacks on 9/11, combining the attack on terrorists **[with
pre-emptive war against 'states supporting terror' as well as imposing
the corollary surveillance regime and suspending a range of
freedoms]{.underline}** on the home front.

Ultimately the doctrine behind the global strategy of tension entails
the explicit option and regular practice of targeted assassination of
opponents. 'The subliminal purpose of terror tactics,' Douglas Valentine
argues in his book on the 'Phoenix' assassination programme in Vietnam,
'was to drive people into a state of infantile dependence. In this
sense, **[[the CIA]{.mark} psy\[chological\] war\[fare\]
experts]{.underline}** were not exorcists come to heal Vietnam and
**[liberate it from Communist demons; their spells were meant to break
up the society and [project its]{.mark} repressed [homicidal impulses
onto the Communists']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Valentine 2000: 63,
emphasis added). This insight still today applies to the condition of
Western society in the War on Terror. As Dominick Jenkins observes, the
Bush administration began the practice of making al-Qaeda a blank screen
for the people's fears; the spectacular theatrics of the Twin Towers
collapses was exploited to show 'the existence of a new kind of
terrorist network with the power to threaten civilisation itself'
(Jenkins 2002: 265).

#### 3 - Turns case - Capitalism undermines democracy through redundancy and inefficiency -- it causes further data and security breaches as well as destroying all liberal values

**Cong '18** \[Wanshu; September 30; Faculty of Law at European
University Institute - Department of Law (LAW), Global Academic Fellow

Reproducing the Democratic Crisis of the Neoliberal Capitalism?" p.
13-14\] SPark

But **[[the sort of democracy driven by financial capitalism cannot be
more socially and politically-detached]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Under
financial capitalism, **[[corporations]{.mark} [compete no
longer]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the basis of their]{.underline}**
manufacturing **[[capacities but]{.mark} their [stock
values]{.mark}]{.underline}**, "immediately through gimmicks and
trickery, but more basically **[through [firing workers, moving
production, and raiding pension funds]{.mark}]{.underline}**". 26
Connected to the expansion of the global value chains, **[[manufacturing
is outsourced]{.mark} to overseas and [organized at a global level that
further separates the labour supply and
consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Financialized **[[companies]{.mark}
[thrive fast and collapse even faster]{.mark}, [unable to provide
long-term employment]{.mark} [and other benefits]{.mark} to the
employees while benefiting the corporate managers who cannot consume
their incomes and must reinvest the money.]{.underline}** The pathology
of the neoliberal, financial capitalism is a much-discussed subject.
Suffice it to say here that the interdependent and reciprocal
relationship between **[capitalist economy and people that gave
favourable [conditions for democracy is significantly
undermined]{.mark}]{.underline}** and reaches to a breaking point. The
break of the positive and reciprocal interdependence further deprives
people of the means of production and alienates people from the
commodities that bear capital value, as the generation and accumulation
of financial capital is largely independent from the work and
consumption of the wage-labour. Without the need to rely on the masses,
**[financial capitalism successfully removes its social-embeddedness and
detaches itself from democratic regulatory frameworks]{.underline}**.27
The change of the means and relationship of production has also
profoundly weakened the bargaining power of the masses. 28 Furthermore,
it is also increasingly difficult to form meaningful labour movements
that push forward institutional changes for common good and public
interest, as people in the neoliberal and consumerist age are left to
take care of themselves, in the name of so-called self-development or
self-entrepreneurship. 29

**[One consequence of the [undermining]{.mark} of the [reciprocal
interdependence is the deepening of socioeconomic
inequalities]{.mark}]{.underline}** which neoliberal governments retreat
from dealing with. **[Socioeconomic inequalities cause serious problem
to democracy, as they lead to [unequal political participation]{.mark}
and [more selective political representation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 30
That socioeconomic inequalities lead to political inequalities can be
vividly testified by the turnout rates and demographics of the elections
in the western countries of recent years.31 **[They also [form the large
social background]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the recent scandals about [cyber
security breaches]{.mark}, [data breaches]{.mark} and fake news in
elections. It can therefore be argued that [the current democratic
crisis is deeply rooted in]{.mark} the economic structure and
relationship of production of the [neoliberal financial
capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Looking Ahead: The Future of Capitalist Lies

**[[Resurgent labor unions can act as a partial solution]{.mark} to
these problems]{.underline}**---that is, **[[assuming]{.mark} that
[workers do not believe the lies that companies
tell]{.mark}]{.underline}** about them. Still, the truly grim thing is
that **[[the problems]{.underline}]{.mark}** exist---and **[[are so
deeply integrated into our way of life]{.underline}]{.mark}**---in the
first place. Let us be brutally honest: **[[our economic system is so
completely saturated with deceit]{.mark} [that it is impossible to
imagine a version]{.mark} of it that [we could actually
trust]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The examples above are just the
tiniest sliver of what we already know about capitalism's assault on
knowledge, and what we know is only a fraction of the whole truth.
**[Even when we aren't being actively lied to, misled, confused, or
distracted, [we have to struggle to find important information
because]{.mark} [capitalist]{.mark} investor[s]{.mark} [go out of their
way to hamstring]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[organizations
that]{.mark} are supposed to [keep us informed.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

In recent years, **[philosophers have begun to discuss what they call
epistemic harms]{.underline}**. As they see it, an epistemic harm is
something that interferes with our ability to know or reason. **[[Under
capitalism, we suffer not just epistemic harms but epistemic
aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that is, intentional, **[[targeted
acts of epistemic interference]{.mark} that are aimed at achieving
dominance]{.underline}**. Indeed, given how broadly and how routinely
capitalist agents lie, **[[we should all consider ourselves to be
belligerents in an epistemic
battle]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**[[or]{.underline}]{.mark}**, to
repurpose Alex Jones's phrase, [**[an information
war]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

And it's not getting better. **[As we develop more advanced forms of
communication and more reliable knowledge about how humans form beliefs,
[capitalists race to invent new forms of
deception]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Corporate propagandists quickly
learned to take advantage of influencers and streamers. Thanks to
advances in information technology, scams are now automated, cons are
data-driven, and profitable hoaxes spread algorithmically. As deepfakes
proliferate and virtual worlds blend with the physical one, the
potential for capitalistic dishonesty will only grow.

**[Nor are [capitalists]{.mark} satisfied with lying their way to the
top of the digital world. They a[im to expand their influence in the
physical world by forming]{.mark} privately owned [cities, replacing the
public courts with their own private arbitration system, and
perfecting]{.mark} the [gatekeeping]{.mark} [mechanisms]{.mark} that
punish us for being anything other than productive, compliant
subjects]{.underline}**. If **[[corporations]{.underline}]{.mark}** can
succeed in replacing public and community services with capitalist
surrogates, they **[can [redefine every part of our lives, changing the
very meanings of the words and concepts]{.mark} that structure our
reality.]{.underline}**

#### The epistemology of the affirmative is grounded in lies and deception as a result from capitalism

**Horowitz 22** \[Eli Horowitz, 6-26-2022, \"Capitalism Is the Real

In the foreword to Last Dance, Last Chance, Ann Rule meditates on the
nature of liars. "**[[Once a lie is successful]{.underline}]{.mark}**,"
she says, "**[[it grows and multiplies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, burnished
and perfected until it works every time. **[It's a sad irony that the
more honest a]{.underline}** potential **[victim is]{.underline}**, the
more innocent, **[the more likely such a person is to become
prey]{.underline}**. Honest people don't expect to be lied to, because
they wouldn't lie to someone else. That doesn't matter at all to
dedicated liars. They only smile." As a true-crime writer, Rule was
talking about murderers, kidnappers, and other violent offenders. But
**[she could]{.underline}** just as easily **[have been [talking about
corporations]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

Under capitalism, **[[corporate dishonesty has
become]{.underline}]{.mark}** so **[[commonplace]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that most of us take it for granted. In doing so, however,
**[we've]{.underline}** allowed ourselves to **[become numb to the
breathtaking scale and bottomless arrogance of corporate
deception]{.underline}**. To be blunt, **[[capitalism wages a]{.mark}
constant, active, ever-evolving [war against knowledge and
reason]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Not only are **[[we]{.mark} constantly
[deluged by false and misleading advertisements]{.mark}]{.underline}**
for goods, services, and even jobs, **[[we've been sold ideals that do
not and cannot exist]{.underline}]{.mark}**, told to navigate a supply
and demand system that's been maliciously bent out of shape, **[[and led
astray on crucial matters]{.mark} of public interest [by]{.mark}
industry-backed [disinformation campaigns]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[Capitalism]{.mark} even interferes with language itself,
[hinder]{.mark}ing [our fundamental ability]{.mark} [to]{.mark} name our
world and [cooperate]{.mark} with one another in order to bring about a
better one]{.underline}**. What's more, these aren't rare or abnormal
events. Once you stop taking all of this for granted, the list of ways
in which capitalists lie is frighteningly endless.

False Names: "Procrustics" and the Capitalist Attack on Free
Communication

**[[In an ideal world]{.underline}]{.mark}**, all of these **[[nefarious
tactics would be met by]{.underline}]{.mark}** a robust response from
**[[governments]{.mark}, researchers, nonprofits, and the
press.]{.underline}** **[[But we are not living in an ideal
world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If anything, **[the opposite is closer to
the truth]{.underline}**: **[[under capitalism, we are fast approaching
dystopia.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Stanislaw Lem, the Polish science-fiction master, foresaw our situation
in a way that no other writer did. In his 1958 novel Eden, he proposed a
method by which **[a tyrant could achieve total, permanent control over
a populace]{.underline}**---but **[without the use of jails, guards,
or]{.underline}** even constant **[surveillance]{.underline}**. He
called this method procrustics, and he described it like this: "It's not
that they do not have names for things, and for the relations between
things, but that the names they have are in fact false, are masks....
**[In order to control the world, one must first name
it]{.underline}**." **[[Without the ability to speak]{.mark} the
[truth]{.mark} to one another, [we cannot unite in action; and without
the ability to unite in action, we cannot overthrow the
tyrant]{.mark}]{.underline}** that drives us toward poverty, strife,
sickness, and misery. In Eden, the name of this tyrant is never
revealed. **[In the real world]{.underline}**, however, we know **[[its
name: capital.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[Thanks to]{.underline}** the **[constant presence of corporate
deception]{.underline}** in our lives, **[[we
barely]{.underline}]{.mark}** even **[[have]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[words to describe what is happening]{.mark} to us]{.underline}**.
**[[Regulatory agencies are dwarfed]{.mark} by]{.underline}** the
**[corporations]{.underline}** they are supposed to oversee,
**[[watchdog nonprofits are overwhelmed]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the
higher education system is buckling under the weight of private
profiteering. But it is **[[media organizations]{.mark} that [have been
hardest-hit]{.mark}]{.underline}** in recent years, **[as [private
equity firms]{.mark} and other hostile investors [have stripped
newsrooms and shuttered]{.mark} entire [reporting]{.mark}
[divisions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In other words, **[even [when
capitalism isn't profiting by lying]{.mark} to us[, it finds a way to
profit by silencing]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[voices]{.underline}]{.mark}** that want to offer us the truth.

As news outlets get picked off like so many deer in hunting season,
**[the ones that remain are being increasingly corrupted]{.underline}**
by hard-right ideologies and corporate money. **[Paid content and
"advertorials" are now ubiquitous, making it difficult to know whether
we are reading honest reporting or an ad with a byline]{.underline}**.
**[Profit-maximizing news organizations also shy away from stories that
might damage their bottom lines, even when the stories are indisputably
true]{.underline}**. In 2018, for example, ESPN altered a fluff piece
about a linebacker's diet in order to avoid offending Wendy's, one of
its advertising partners. All of these practices are blatant violations
of journalistic ethics, but [**[capitalism will never choose
transparency---let alone morality---over money]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

Not even our day-to-day conversations are safe. As many observers have
noted in recent years, **[capitalist culture has begun leaking out into
the broader world, interfering with our ability to simply talk to one
another]{.underline}**. Corporate "garbage language" has spilled over
into casual speech, filling our conversations with meaningless jargon
and inspiring many of us to think in toxic, empty-headed "grindset"
memes. Naturally, the situation inside the workplace is even worse.
Hundreds of posts on the popular r/antiwork subreddit feature bosses who
falsely tell their employees that they are not allowed to discuss their
wages. Other workers strain against job requirements that require them
to lie to customers and colleagues. And by threatening, censoring, and
retaliating against any workers who dare to speak their minds,
corporations chop away at our ability to communicate with one another,
thereby attacking dissent at the root.

#### The advancement of biotechnology is fueled by neoliberal greed - all of their advantages are just illusions to cover up their true intentions - the existence of capitalist makes all biotech ineffective and subject to ethical violations

[People often claim that capitalism focuses only on short-term
profits.]{.underline} But the [[venture capitalists and angel]{.mark}
[investors who fund firms such as Moderna and BioNTech]{.mark} are
hugely patient, and they [lose money on most]{.mark} of their
[investments.]{.mark}]{.underline} Typically, [[their model rests
on]{.mark} the [calc]{.mark}ulation [that a small percentage of]{.mark}
their [investments will generate a sufficiently high return on going
public or being sold to both "pay" for those that]{.mark} --- as will
often be the case]{.underline} in a very tricky sector --- [[lose money
(or make very little)]{.underline}]{.mark} and make the sort of good
money that they and their clients are expecting when putting together an
investment portfolio. [[In biotech]{.mark}nology and other leading-edge
industries, [after-tax investor gains are]{.mark} often [reinvested in

[[the Struengmanns']{.mark}]{.underline} capital gains [[from selling

[ensure that investors and entrepreneurs are incentivized to take the
risk of committing time and resources to ventures that can offer no
promise of a good return]{.mark},]{.underline} the sort of ventures, in
other words, so [typical of ventures relying on scientific and technical
innovation. [Those who take high risks should be rewarded, if that risk
works out, with high rewards.]{.mark}]{.underline} Unfortunately, [that
logic eludes]{.underline} President Biden and congressional
[Democrats.]{.underline} They not only would like to raise
capital-gains-tax rates, but some of them would also like to broaden the
capital-gains-tax base, including by taxing gains before they are
realized. If applied to startup investing, that could do terrible damage
to the ability of early stage companies to secure the patient capital
that they need. [Punishing capital gains makes no sense if we want
investors and entrepreneurs to pursue valuable but risky growth
opportunities.]{.underline} Some cynics are griping about the big
profits that Moderna and BioNTech are now making, but investors in those
firms absorbed losses for a decade.

#### 2 - Developments in biotech are driven by neoliberal greed

We continue to fight COVID-19 and its variants, but the rapid
development of vaccines last year put us on the offensive against the
disease. Vaccines from Moderna of Massachusetts and BioNTech of Germany
have led the way, with 360 million doses delivered in the United States
to date. (BioNTech teamed with Pfizer for the manufacturing and
distribution of its shot.)The federal government expedited drug
approvals and helped to fund the vaccine roll-out. But how were Moderna
and BioNTech able to design and deliver highly effective vaccines so
quickly --- in months, rather than the years it usually takes for
vaccines?

The answer is that the two companies had been working on the mRNA
technologies behind the vaccines for a decade, and they were supported
by more than \$3 billion of private capital. [Moderna's and BioNTech's
[vaccines are a triumph of the biotechnology industry and]{.mark} of
[the venture capitalists and wealthy]{.mark} angel [investors]{.mark}
who fund it.]{.underline}

The large potential of mRNA technology now seems clear, but that was not
always the case. Katalin Karikó at the University of Pennsylvania spent
years studying mRNA, but
she [received](https://avanan.url-protection.com/v1/url?o=https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/&g=MDkyZjE0ZTQxZmYzZTU5MA==&h=NDU0MzYxN2RmZjY2Mjg0MGQwZjRiYmQ3OTI2MWU5YjRiMGI1NDdlNzU4YzU1ZTlkZDZjYTFkZDVkNjBiM2UxMA==&p=YXAzOmNhdG9pbnN0aXR1dGU6YXZhbmFuOm86MjZiNWU0YTg1MTVjMDA2ZDllZDRhNmIyNDVmNGZjYzk6djE=) little

applications of mRNA technologies.

federal funding is crucial for medical research, but that was not the
case for Moderna. Prior to 2020, the company received just two [federal

\$150 million, a fraction of the private funding it

Meanwhile, in Germany, biotech entrepreneurs Uğur Şahin and Özlem Türeci
co-founded BioNTech in 2008 to explore advances in mRNA technologies.
The startup received a [€180

wealth by building drug firm Hexal. BioNTech raised a total of \$1.3

have received relatively little government funding before 2020, only a
few tens of millions of dollars.]{.underline}

Applying their knowledge from years of research, both Moderna and
BioNTech responded quickly when they learned of the new virus in January
2020. When the Chinese published COVID-19's genetic code, it took
Moderna just two days to design a vaccine and [42
days](https://avanan.url-protection.com/v1/url?o=https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/02/25/coronavirus-vaccine-moderna-therapeutics-cambridge&g=MjllMGI5NGY3Yzc3NGYwYQ==&h=YzM5NmYyY2MxOGZjOGU0ODljOWY0NDI3ZWMwODk5ZWZlYmQ5Nzg1YjIxNzRkZWZlY2EwMzdlOWZmMTJjMzRhYg==&p=YXAzOmNhdG9pbnN0aXR1dGU6YXZhbmFuOm86MjZiNWU0YTg1MTVjMDA2ZDllZDRhNmIyNDVmNGZjYzk6djE=) to
ship vials of the drug to the National Institutes of Health. Both
companies gained government approval for their vaccines by December and
began distributing millions of doses. These are the world's first
vaccines created by mRNA technologies.

[People often claim that capitalism focuses only on short-term profits.
But [the venture capitalists and angel investors who fund firms such as
Moderna and BioNTech are hugely patient, and they lose money on most of
their investments. Typically, their model rests on the calculation that
a small percentage of their investments will generate a sufficiently
high return]{.mark} on going public or being sold to both "pay" for
those that --- as will often be the case in a very tricky sector ---
lose money (or make very little) [and make the sort of good money that
they and their clients are expecting when putting together an investment
portfolio.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In biotechnology and other leading-edge industries[, after-tax investor
gains are often reinvested in the next round of risky startups, thus
creating a virtuous cycle]{.mark}. If the government had taxed away the
Struengmanns' capital gains from selling Hexal, they might not have had
the cash or incentive to invest in BioNTech. [One of the reasons that
nearly all high-income countries keep capital-gains taxes low is to help
ensure that investors and entrepreneurs are incentivized to take the
risk of committing time and resources to ventures that can offer no
promise of a good return, the sort of ventures, in other words, so
typical of ventures relying on scientific and technical innovation.
Those who take high risks should be rewarded, if that risk works out,
with high rewards.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Unfortunately, that logic eludes President Biden and congressional
Democrats. They not only would like to raise capital-gains-tax rates,
but some of them would also like to broaden the capital-gains-tax base,
including by taxing gains before they are realized. If applied to
startup investing, that could do terrible damage to the ability of early
stage companies to secure the patient capital that they need. Punishing
capital gains makes no sense if we want investors and entrepreneurs to
pursue valuable but risky growth opportunities.

To undermine an approach that has worked so well, and delivered so much,

it may well come at considerable human cost, too. 

#### 3 - Biotech makes capitalism ethically worse 

**Cohen**, 20**06** (Eric , author and editor-at-large of The New
Atlantis. "Biotechnology and the Spirit of Capitalism" The New Atlantis.
2006.
[https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/biotechnology-and-the-spirit-of-capitalism
///](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/biotechnology-and-the-spirit-of-capitalism%20///)MF)

The spirit of modern capitalism is as varied as the souls of modern men.
Virtually every type of morality is "for sale," and virtually every
human type finds his place in the modern economy. The cosmetic surgeon
specializing in breast implants. The observant Jew rushing to finish
work before sundown. Sex stories on MTV and salvation stories at the
movies. Oil-drilling corporations and embryo-destroying start-ups. Queer
Eye for the Straight Guy and NASCAR racing.

Watching commercials on television, trolling the Internet, going to
work, it is clear that commerce captures the many possibilities of human
life, both for better and for worse. It mostly involves decent men and
women working hard to better themselves and provide for their families.
But commerce sometimes goes deep into the human gutter --- the
multi-billion-dollar child-pornography industry is perhaps the grossest
example --- dragging many ordinary people down with it. The modern
economy relies largely on average people doing average work, competently
if not brilliantly. But it also nourishes and depends upon
more-than-average individuals --- including those who remake the world
with their talents and visions, often with technologies that aim to
satisfy every human desire.

[Perhaps the most striking dimension of the [modern economy is the
commerce of the body]{.mark}, including an impressive array of new
biotechnologies and biological procedures that promise to improve,
control, or manipulate our native biology. In myriad ways, the better
body is for sale --- from anti-impotence drugs to anti-depressants, from
cosmetic surgery to low-carb diets, from baby-making clinics promising
you a healthy child to the current push to legalize the buying and
selling of human organs. And if one looks ahead to the biotechnologies
of the future --- improved mood- and memory-altering drugs,
stem-cell-based medicine, genetic muscle enhancements, new techniques
for controlling the genomes of one's offspring --- [it is clear that the
commerce of the body will only become more ambitious, selling bodily
perfection to anyone with enough disposable income.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[This leaves us to wonder: Is "bio-capitalism" something novel, bringing
with it a new spirit and new dilemmas? Or is it simply the continuation
of modern capitalism's promise to "better our condition" indefinitely?
No doubt the answer is some combination of continuity and novelty. The
interesting question is whether the novel dimensions of bio-capitalism
are so fundamental that we need to rethink our moral intuitions about
capitalism itself. In a word: Does the [new commerce of the body portend
a moral crisis for modern capitalism?]{.mark}]{.underline}

As always, to understand where we are heading, we need to revisit where
we came from. From the beginning, the idea of modern capitalism was
connected to various notions of the good life, or different assessments
of the best life possible for limited, selfish, and imperfect human
beings. Morality and modern commerce were always inseparable, and the
defense of commerce (like the lament) was originally made in moral
terms.

By morality, I mean living well (both as individuals and as a society)
with the permanent questions of being human, including the questions
that arise because we are bodily beings with bodies that fail or fail to
satisfy: How do I face suffering and death? What are my obligations to
my parents and children? Do the religious traditions of my birth still
bind me, and how do I regard the piety or impiety of others? What are my
obligations to the weak, poor, nasty, and insane? What is the meaning of
my sexual desires and erotic longings? Does the noble end I seek ---
saving a soul, freeing the oppressed, curing the sick --- justify a
given means to try to achieve it?

[Modern capitalism, at its origins, addressed these moral and
existential questions --- sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly. It
did not spring from a single idea of the human condition or embody a
single answer to man's great questions, but at least three different
attitudes toward life and commerce.]{.underline} One is the spirit
of God-seeking enterprise embodied in early Protestantism; the second is
the irreverent self-love embodied in the likes of Voltaire; and the
third is the worldly moderation best articulated by Adam Smith. To be
sure, typologies such as this one often distort as much as they clarify;
history is messy and complex, and the history of capitalism is winding
and tumultuous, with passionate defenders, savage critics, and many
unexpected turns. Still, the presence of these three different spirits
of capitalism is undeniable, and undeniably important.

Capitalism's Three Spirits

In [The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of
Capitalism](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/048642703X/the-new-atlantis-20),
Max Weber describes how a new idea of salvation --- a new creed about
the relationship between man and God, worldly life and other-worldly
grace --- unexpectedly initiated the age of modern capitalism. It would
be a vast oversimplification to say that there was a single Protestant
Reformation; for there were many cross-currents, as Weber describes. But
two ideas in particular --- Luther's idea of "calling" and Calvin's idea
of "predestination" --- fundamentally altered the behavior of believing
Christians and the trajectory of the West. Worldly work could now be
understood in vocational terms. "The fulfillment of worldly duties is
under all circumstances the only way to live acceptably to God,"
describes Weber. "It and it alone is the will of God, and hence every
legitimate calling has exactly the same worth in the sight of God."

But only by combining the idea of "calling" with the theology of
"predestination" --- that is, the belief in salvation by God's
unfathomable grace alone, breathed into us at birth --- did the spirit
of capitalism find its paradoxical roots. For men could not live in
practice or for long with a grace so mysterious, or with the state of
their eternal souls so uncertain. They wanted "proof" --- proof to
themselves, proof before others, and proof before God that "I" am indeed
saved. This desire for proof gave believing Protestants an "irrational"
will to work with little interest in savoring the worldly fruits of
their labors. The individual toiled instead as a sign of other-worldly
salvation, and in accordance (as he saw it) with a divinely chosen
calling. Every detail of life was rationalized and perfected; even the
smallest sign of waywardness might be a sign of one's un-chosenness.
Practical science was welcomed and mystical speculation discouraged.

The result of such an ethic, according to Weber, was a magnificent
increase in material wealth, due largely to the accumulation of capital
that came from producing so much and enjoying so little, from the
combination of restless toil and ascetic self-denial. But the wealth
produced as the outward fruit of man's piety threatened to undermine the
inner commitment to God. As John Wesley, the founder of Methodism,
declared:

I fear, wherever riches have increased, the essence of religion has
decreased in the same proportion.... \[T\]he Methodists in every place
grow diligent and frugal; consequently they increase in goods. Hence
they proportionally increase in pride, in anger, in the desire of the
flesh, the desire of the eyes, and the pride of life. So, although the
form of religion remains, the spirit is swiftly vanishing away. Is there
no way to prevent this --- this continual decay of pure religion? We
ought not to prevent people from being diligent and frugal;
we must exhort all Christians to gain all they can, and to save all they
can; that is, in effect, to grow rich. What way, then, can we take, that
our money may not sink us to the nethermost hell? There is one way, and
there is no other under heaven. If those who gain all they can,
and save all they can, will likewise give all they can, then the more
they gain the more they will grow in grace, and the more treasure they
will lay up in heaven.

Whether Weber is quite correct about the historical connection between
the Protestant ethic and the birth of capitalism is a complicated and
much disputed question. What seems clear is that God-seeking Protestants
were central to the first flourishing of modern commerce, and that over
time the fruits of such enterprise came to seem more desirable in
themselves. As Weber put it: "The intensity of the search for the
Kingdom of God commenced gradually to pass over into sober economic
virtue; the religious roots died out slowly, giving way to utilitarian
worldliness." In this way, the formula was reversed --- not material
success as proof of salvation, but salvation via our material success.

Through Protestantism, commerce was made a realm of "grace." But over
time, it was not God's grace alone, or at all, that men sought, but the
grace of being a "self-made man" --- the grace that was formed by one's
own labors or secured by one's own ingenuity, not bestowed as a divine
gift and obligation. Before Protestantism, salvation was largely set
apart from (or above) the realm of commerce --- in the sacraments, the
monastery, or the Sabbath. Protestantism weakened this separation ---
directing men, if somewhat unintentionally, to see the labors of life as
proof of salvation, and eventually as its very source. But sooner or
later, the self-made man confronts the limits of his own self-made
grace. He is struck by misfortune, or boredom, or mortality. His grace
is haunted and incomplete. The "religious roots" of commerce continue to
lurk as ghosts within the modern economy. To this day, we are still
haunted by the salvation that modern commerce once promised, and still
hunting after the kinds of salvation it might yet give us --- not in
heaven, but in the flesh.

For Voltaire, the delights of the flesh were worth celebrating, and he
admired commerce precisely for its capacity to promote worldly goods
(including bodily pleasures) through freedom and exchange. Where the
Protestant ethic prized self-denial, Voltaire celebrated self-love; and
where the Protestant believer labored out of devotion to a saving God,
Voltaire celebrated commerce for making such pious devotions irrelevant.
"Religionists may rail in vain," he wrote. "I own, I like this age
profane." He liked its physical comforts and the room it afforded for
his playful, "worldly mind." He led a life of wild speculation ---
filled with financial schemes that would have made the managers of Enron
proud --- and he praised the London Exchange as a place where the only
"infidels" were those who went "bankrupt."

As Jerry Muller describes in his superb book [The Mind and the
Market](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385721668/the-new-atlantis-20),
the real enemy for Voltaire was religious enthusiasm, which led men to
slit each other's throats over archaic and trivial superstitions. "Here
Voltaire is the prophet of the profit motive," Muller describes.
"Compared to the competitive quest for salvation, the quest for wealth
is more likely to make men 'peaceful' and 'content.' Compared to the
altruistic crusade of forcibly saving one's neighbor's soul, even if it
leaves his body in ruins, the pursuit of wealth is a potentially more
peaceable pursuit, and one that leaves one's neighbor content."

But it was not just religious conflict that Voltaire abhorred, but the
pious man's devotion to a false salvation, his idealization of a
wretched past at the cost of making a better future. In a poem with the
fitting title "The Worldling," Voltaire pays tribute to the wonders of
his age --- the "needful superfluous things," the "luxury and
pleasures." He mocks Adam and Eve for the wretchedness of their flesh,
the dirty ground they slept in, the tasteless food they ate.

My fruit-eating first father, say,\
In Eden how rolled time away?\
Did you work for the human race,\
And clasp dame Eve with close embrace!\
Own that your nails you could not pare,\
And that you wore disordered hair,\
That you were swarthy in complexion,\
And that your amorous affection\
Had very little better in't\
Than downright animal instinct.\
Both weary of the marriage yoke\
You supped each night beneath an oak\
On millet, water, and on mast,\
And having finished your repast,\
On the ground you were forced to lie,\
Exposed to the inclement sky:\
Such in the state of simple nature\
Is man, a helpless, wretched creature.

Eve, in other words, could use a trip to the perfume counter and the
salon. To embrace such a "wretched creature" is to be nothing more than
an animal. Beyond the flesh, Voltaire praises the artists and the
architects --- the real makers of "grace." He delights in what is
visible to the eye inside "rich golden frames," not what is knowable to
the soul oriented toward heaven. The poem ends with Voltaire's fitting
words of self-praise: "Terrestrial paradise is where I am." He is a
"worldling" and nothing else, living in a paradise of "self-love" and
"happy commerce," one that he desperately hopes to sustain --- decaying
flesh be damned.

Adam Smith, you might say, offered a moderate vision --- between the
Protestant quest for other-worldly salvation and Voltaire's irreverent
delight in the luxuries of the flesh. With Voltaire, he believed that an
alternative needed to be found to the wars of religious piety, and that
state-regulated salvation was a recipe for tyranny and slaughter. And
yet, he did not see religion itself as an enemy, and he took for
granted, as Irving Kristol and others have argued, the habit-forming
effects of traditional institutions like church and family. Without the
Puritan work ethic, it is unlikely that Smith's practical vision would
have gotten off the ground. But Smith did not offer a commerce of
salvation --- worldly or other-worldly --- but a commerce of progress,
one that expanded man's liberty and gradually improved his condition. It
was a sober and practical vision for sober and practical men. He was
interested in building a decent society, by taking seriously both man's
rational self-interest and his capacity for self-restraint, both his
natural acquisitiveness and his latent civility. And he sought a society
that improved the condition of all willing individuals, not simply a
society where the strong triumphed over the weak, or where the wealthy
pursued life's niceties while the poor remained in a condition of
permanent desperation.

Smith, in other words, sought to build a future that "worked" --- and by
most accounts, he succeeded tremendously. We live in the world he built,
with souls still shaped in large measure by his vision, and a politics
still informed by his realism about the limits of radically remaking the
human condition by conscious design. Smith's "system of natural liberty"
worked in two basic ways: First, it explained how the natural desire for
self-improvement and the range of natural human capacities could cohere
to produce a prosperous economic system --- one in which individuals
responded to the changing needs of the market and the changing
possibilities of production, and lived with the freedom to "better their
condition" according to their own lights. In this way, the desire for
private profit could serve the public interest, and the largely free
market could produce an organic order from below, one impossible to
create from above. Second, Smith showed how commercial life could have a
civilizing effect on acquisitive individuals, who needed to work hard
and tolerate others in order to prosper. The commercial society does not
stamp out selfishness or spread the gospel of brotherly love. But it
does channel self-interest and promote civil society among individuals
with different backgrounds and tastes. And it creates the wealth
necessary for somewhat higher aspirations, if not necessarily the desire
to pursue them.

Smith believed an economic system should be judged in moral terms ---
[judged for the kind of people it produces and the way of life it allows
to flourish. And he was not blind to [capitalism's moral shortcomings
--- including the rise of scheming businessmen moved only by greed and
devoid of conscience, and the existence of laborers made dull and
brutish by performing a few simple functions without
end]{.mark}.]{.underline} But the problems of greed, nastiness, and
stupidity were hardly unique to modern capitalist life, and in many ways
they were much worse in pre-capitalist societies. The problem, of
course, was and remains the limits of human nature itself; a social
system, at best, could promote virtues and curb vices --- not make
average men into philosophers or saints.

Peculiarly, the one thing that pious Protestantism and Voltairean
atheism agreed upon was that commerce was a good thing. Traditional
(Catholic and Orthodox) Christianity had thought otherwise, and modern
radical progressivism thinks otherwise, too. But in that moment, two key
combatants on the battlefield of the early modern age agreed about the
virtues of enterprise. Adam Smith, in turn, sought to assuage the
struggle between them by focusing on this point of agreement, and so we
now think of this great moral philosopher as an economist, but only
because he saw that commerce was the way to peace in modern times. This
age was almost bound to be defined by commerce, because those who fought
to shape the age agreed almost only in their veneration of trade. But
trade, alas, is not the most venerable thing, because what men buy and
sell cannot address man's deepest longings, even if the culture of the
marketplace sometimes curbs his worst excesses.

Biotechnology and the Counterculture

In 1991, with the last vestiges of communism crumbling and the Cold War
ending, Irving Kristol warned that the greatest threats to a capitalist
future were spiritual and cultural. "In a sense," he said, "it is all
Adam Smith's fault. That amiable, decent genius simply could not imagine
a world where traditional moral certainties could be effectively
challenged and repudiated. Bourgeois society is his legacy, for good and
ill. For good, in that it has produced, through the market economy, a
world prosperous beyond all previous imaginings --- including socialist
imaginings. For ill, in that this world, with every passing decade, has
become ever more spiritually impoverished."

In the end, Smith's error was his lack of "eschatological realism." Man
is not simply an average being who seeks to improve in material ways. He
is also an imperfect being who yearns for perfection, a mortal being who
yearns for immortality, and an ambitious being who sometimes believes
that he can make others more perfect or less mortal through his own
mastery of nature. And so Adam Smith's world of practical commerce --- a
great success --- is still haunted by the Protestant desire for
other-worldly grace and by Voltaire's desire for "terrestrial paradise."
We demand that material progress offer salvation --- which is exactly
what socialism once promised and what biotechnology may promise in the
future. Or we demand that material progress be abandoned in the name of
salvation --- soberly, by those who seek to preserve sacred retreats in
a profane world, or radically, by extremists who seek to dismantle
modern life altogether.

This quest for salvation can either go "with the grain" or "against the
grain" of modern commercial society. Modern science --- especially
modern biological science --- has long gone with the grain: seeking
useful inventions, practical advances, and the "relief of man's estate"
through a growing mastery of nature's laws and human biology. Technology
has long been the art of self-improvement, and commercial society has
long been inseparable from the creation and dissemination of new
technologies. The implementation of Francis Bacon's vision has rarely
shocked the Smithian mind, and mostly pleased it.

By contrast, modernist culture --- art, literature, mores, and manners
--- has largely gone against the grain of modern commercial society. It
saw the bourgeois world as boring, repressed, and unsatisfying --- a
world of "one-dimensional men," hungry for property, ruled by
old-fashioned values left-over from outdated religions. Modernism sought
a life of the spirit in a life of immodesty --- a life without limits,
sexual or otherwise. It saw the mass of men as automatons, and it saw
mass society as guilty of the degradation of both nature and culture.
And yet it also imagined that man himself was a creature without shame,
a being beyond sin. It believed that alienation was a problem of
history, not a condition of our nature. This attitude was epitomized in
the counterculture of the 1960s --- with its liberation of the body from
old taboos, and its childish illusions about the remaking of man.

Back then, it seemed as though the culture of technology and the
counterculture were mortal enemies. The machine vs. the spirit.
Dionysian feeling vs. rational investigation. Gradual progress vs.
spontaneous liberation. And of course, in some ways, they were and still
remain bitter enemies. But perhaps not in the most important ways. For
it may be that the peculiarities of our own recent history mask a deeper
connection between the counterculture and the culture of modern
technology --- a connection grounded in the belief that human limits
should be overcome, taboos are anathema, and human shame is an illusion.
Both cultures believe that no knowledge or no experience should be off
limits, and that death is an unfair or unnecessary sentence --- to be
overcome by technology or mocked artistically into submission. Both are
willing to go where modest men never went before, at least not in
public.

Let me make this point with a rather unpleasant example. Within a few
days of one another I recently came upon the following two stories:
Story #1, in The New Yorker, was about new works of art. It included a
picture of a grotesque sculpture, consisting of a number of naked
children, connected to one another in the flesh, with penises as noses.
Story #2 was about a promising new technique of assisted reproduction,
which allows women to remove a piece of their ovaries, freeze it
indefinitely, and implant it into their arm or abdomen as a source of
eggs whenever they decide to have children.

Now I suspect many bourgeois scientists would find the penis-faced
statue appalling, though they might defend the right to produce it as
freedom of expression, akin to their own freedom of research. But the
artists, I suspect, would actually admire the scientist's biological
"transgression," the splicing of reproductive organs out of their
"normal" context, the making public of once private parts. And even if
the scientists reject such works of art as absurdities, modern
biotechnology --- and much else about modern commerce --- has benefited
greatly from the triumph of postmodern culture. For it was the radicals
of the 1960s that cleared away the very taboos surrounding the body that
would have inhibited the newest possibilities of modern biotechnology.
Can we imagine the commerce of the body today --- or even the science
that underlies it --- without the prior triumph of the culture of
immodesty? Would there have been terrain upon which scientists --- and
their investors --- feared to tread if the counterculture had not tread
there first? Could it be that scientific rationalism and post-modern
irrationality have more in common than it once seemed?

[The genius of commerce is that it tames remarkable things; it makes
past transgressions seem normal. What shocks the parents bores the
children --- both in culture and in science. Living together before
marriage, test-tube babies --- that's yesterday's news. [We can already
imagine a future]{.mark} where cosmetic surgery is as common as
orthodontics; where mood-altering drugs are a mass phenomenon, like
vitamins (or painkillers) for the soul; where people sell their deceased
loved one's organs; where 10 to 15 percent of women reproduce using in
vitro fertilization, screening their embryos for sex, height, and other
desirable genetic predispositions; and where sick patients harvest
embryonic clones of themselves as a source of life-saving stem cells.
And we are left to wonder: What will it be like to live in such a world,
to raise a family in such a world, to work in such a world, to invest
money in such a world? [What will be the relationship between
biotechnology, morality, and commerce?]{.mark}]{.underline}

The New Commerce of the Body

[Of course, [most biotechnology is admirable]{.mark}; it is a
continuation of bourgeois progress as we have long known it, whose only
negative effect is raising expectations, and thus raising the stakes of
potential calamity. But there are also reasons to believe that the new
commerce of the body is growing increasingly removed from Smith's sober
vision. It [promises perfection, not progress; and it heeds no limits,
treating the sacred and the profane as indistinguishable objects for
sale, ruled only by the amoral law of supply and demand. Lest this all
seem too abstract, consider a few everyday
examples.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Example 1. The Betrayal of the Child.

By now, the idea of selling one's eggs or sperm to others who wish to
produce a child is commonplace. One need only look in any elite
college's newspaper to find advertisements offering substantial sums of
money --- \$25,000 or \$50,000 --- for egg donors with perfect figures
and high SAT scores. There are numerous companies that specialize in
brokering eggs, often catering to very particular tastes. Recently, a
law-student friend of mine received a solicitation in the mail:

Dear Potential Egg Donor: The Genetics and IVF Institute is looking for
healthy, college educated, ethnically diverse women between the ages of
21 and 32 to assist infertile couples by becoming an anonymous egg
donor....You will be adequately compensated for each cycle you complete
... beginning at \$5,000 \[and going\] up to \$45,000.... Help an
infertile couple experience the joy and fulfillment of parenthood.

Now in market terms, this potential transaction makes perfect sense ---
matching a willing seller and a willing buyer. Both parties get what
they need --- tuition money, the seeds of a new child --- and no one is
coerced into anything. But what is the human meaning of what is
happening? One couple desperately seeks a child of their own, a child
biologically related to the father genetically and the mother by
pregnancy. This is why IVF came into existence in the first place ---
because the infertile seek not just a child to raise, but a child who is
flesh of their flesh. But to make this possible, in some cases, they
need a seller who is willing to abandon his or her own biological child;
willing to be an anonymous donor; willing never to set eyes upon the
child that is flesh of their flesh. The buyers who desperately want a
biological child need a seller who sees having a biological child as no
big deal. In market terms, again, this makes sense: a case of two
parties valuing different commodities differently. But in human terms,
it means finding a seller who denies the very human longing that the
buyer wishes to act upon. It requires a seller who is willing to betray
his or her own flesh and blood offspring --- not out of desperation, but
for a price.

Example 2. The Shaming of the Father.

By now, ads for anti-impotence drugs are common fare in magazines and on
television. One of the most memorable campaigns starred the former
Chicago Bears coach "Iron" Mike Ditka --- once the consummate tough guy,
who takes the "Levitra challenge" to "stay in the game." Coach Ditka is
apparently comfortable discussing his erectile dysfunction, and perhaps
proud of his continued desire for virility. He flaunts his nakedness ---
the loss of his powers, the hunger for his powers --- for all the world
to see, including his children.

Now consider another story --- the story of Noah in the book of Genesis,
naked in his tent; and the story of his sons (Shem and Japheth), who so
revere their father that they do not look upon him. They walk backward
to him and cover him with their cloak. As Leon Kass describes: "They
intuitively understand that, were they to see with their own eyes their
father's nakedness, their family order would be permanently altered....
By protecting Noah's dignity and authority, they safeguard their own
capacity to exercise paternal authority in the future.... They knowingly
choose to live leaving some things in the dark, without pressing back to
the naked truth about temporal beginnings or ultimate origins." Even in
his old age, they see their father as a giant, the source of their own
being.

Today, by contrast, we leave nothing in the dark and we strip down every
giant. Both proper pride and proper shame are thrown to the wind. While
Coach Ditka might seek such drugs in the name of his manliness, it is
precisely his manliness that is compromised. By flaunting his desire to
"stay in the game," he loses the reverence --- the majesty --- that a
dignified old man should command of those beneath him. Instead, he lays
out his nakedness for all the world to see, including the sons who now
cannot help but shame him. In his quest for potency, he reveals his
ultimate dependence, with no cloak to preserve any ennobling illusions.

Example 3. The Modern Birth-Mark.

Not long ago, the Fox network aired a "reality" show called The Swan,
which took a score of average-looking women, sent them to a team of
cosmetic surgeons who remade their bodies under the knife, and then put
the refurbished ladies on stage to decide who is the most beautiful ---
to decide which ugly duckling is now the swan. Already, cosmetic surgery
is no longer simply the province of actors in Hollywood and politicians
in Washington. It is becoming --- slowly but steadily --- a mass
phenomenon, and perhaps soon a middle-class phenomenon. Some parents now
give their teenage daughters nose-jobs and breast implants as high
school graduation presents.

As a consequence, physical beauty is no longer seen as nature's
endowment but as man's creation. Aging is no longer accepted gracefully
but fought back with the knife. Imperfection is increasingly
intolerable. Like Georgiana in Nathaniel Hawthorne's "The Birth-mark,"
we subject ourselves to technicians of the body in the hope of being
loved, or in the hope of making bystanders into lustful worshippers of
our flesh. And the question is: In so doing, what have we lost? After
all, beauty is never an achievement but an undeserved gift of nature.
Why does it matter whether the giver of the gift is God, the gods, or
the master surgeon? What is lost in removing this year's imperfections?
Perhaps nothing. The trouble, of course, is next year's imperfections.
And the problem is that our new "look" will inevitably change all our
pre-surgery relations: To our parents, perhaps it will be a partial
indictment of their own sub-par appearance; to our spouse, perhaps it
will be an admission that I was not beautiful enough then; to our
children, perhaps it will teach them that they too might need cosmetic
surgery someday, since the genes they inherit come from the pre-surgical
self. Even as we remake the flesh in accordance with our will, we cannot
escape the attachments of the flesh that we did not will --- the
attachments to our parents and our children. We have the swan's face and
the ugly duckling's family.

Example 4. The Broken Soul.

Of course, it is not just the body we seek to fix but also the embodied
mind. Commercials for mood-altering drugs are ubiquitous, and the use of
such drugs has skyrocketed in the last decade, with distracted
two-year-olds to the depressed elderly to everyone in between as part of
the market. According to the dean of one Ivy League school, roughly 20
percent of the incoming class takes some kind of anti-depressant.

The commercials for these drugs all work in the same way: a troubled
child or employee --- failing at work, failing at school, growing more
distant from loved ones. Then a drug that promises, as one slogan puts
it, to "reveal the real you." And then a sudden transformation, a new
life of smiles, friends, and productivity. A thirty-second commedia with
neurochemistry as the playwright. Without question, such drugs can help
many individuals who suffer from terrible mental illness, rooted in
chemical problems in the brain, that only medication can ameliorate. For
such people --- the truly sick --- psychotropic drugs are a godsend. And
no doubt the strategy of selling these drugs is the same as selling any
other product: convincing people they are inadequate as they are, yet
within reach of perfection; making people feel sick and desperate, only
to discover that what they lack is some liberating product.

But surely something deeper is at work here, when the inadequacy is the
psyche itself, and the liberation involves, in part, a new identity
altogether. The real questions about the rise of psychotropic drugs go
beyond the present essay --- questions about why so many people feel so
depressed in the first place, why they believe only medication can help
them, and who they really are once they start taking these mood-altering
medications and start forming human relationships that depend on taking
the drugs to sustain them. I can only note here the strangeness of this
new marketing of dependence, and the significance of coming to believe
that life's dilemmas are fundamentally problems of brain chemistry, only
solvable by medication. Perhaps we will also come to believe the
inverse: that life's best possibilities are likewise matters of
chemistry, only achievable with medication.

In a certain sense, of course, this is all true: we live as given
bodies, with drives that we do not fully control and cannot fully
explain, and limits that come with our particular set of DNA. But we
also live --- or have long lived --- with the belief that we are more
than our chemicals, that our choices, joys, and miseries are more than
inexplicable neuroactivity, that there is a difference between what is
real and what is induced.

Perhaps the deepest problem with such drugs --- taken by a widow to ease
the pain of her mourning, or after a terrorist attack to calm one's
sense of horror --- is that they will confound, not restore, our sense
of the world as it really is. To sleep easily amid carnage or rest
easily after the death of a beloved spouse is to live in a world of
fantasy. It is to seek salvation by no longer being fully human.

Example 5. The Embryo and the Coffee Grind.

My final example is somewhat more futuristic, but not entirely so.
Depending on where the science takes us, it is not too far-fetched to
imagine that human embryos will one day be valuable medical commodities
--- harvested routinely as a source stem cells. Embryo destruction for
research purposes is now commonplace. Scientists are already exploring
methods that would allow us to produce human eggs artificially, thus
eliminating the only practical barrier to embryo production on an
industrial scale. And no doubt such embryos will trade in the market
like any other commodity --- perhaps even on the "commodities exchange."

Perhaps I exaggerate, but it is an exaggeration with a point. What the
market does is veil the meaning of what it uses so that everything can
be used efficiently. It tames the remarkable and makes it seem normal
--- like everything else. It reduces each commodity to measurable data
--- where what matters is not the different things in themselves but the
differential movements on the chart: coffee grinds up, embryos down;
computer parts up, body parts down; Viagra up, Paxil down. Even the
individual who is troubled by this prospect --- who still asks whether a
human embryo deserves more respect than a natural resource --- will find
it hard not to participate: Will he reject embryo therapies that might
save his child? Will he leave his job at the insurance company that
covers such therapies? Will he sell the mutual fund that buys shares in
an embryo-production company?

Beyond "science says"

The New Atlantis is building a culture in which science and technology
work for, not on, human beings.

We should not forget that the goal of embryo commerce would be
humanitarian --- the pursuit of health, the very good that modern
societies most desire. But the means are, arguably, a form of
cannibalism of the weak by the strong --- if a cannibalism not obvious
to the eye because embryos look so un-human, and thus without a visceral
repugnance to awaken our conscience and guide our behavior. But the
violation is no less real for being unobvious, and it is only possible
because we now take for granted a truly remarkable thing --- the power
to initiate human life outside the body, the power to see and hold what
was once left shrouded.

[And this, I think, is what we should most fear about [biotechnology's
transformation of modern capitalism: that in the desire for worldly
salvati]{.mark}on --- salvation of the flesh --- we will profane the
sacred, with the modern marketplace greasing the skids. [We will come to
believe that bio-capitalism can sell us everything we desire, and thus
come to accept that everything is for sale.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Moral Limits of Capitalism

Such a critique is not meant as an act of ingratitude for our economic
prosperity and freedom. Only a fool would belittle the genuine virtues
of progress, and I can imagine no better way to organize a modern
society than democratic capitalism. [At the same time, however, we must
face up to the fact that [modern commerce is often a moral problem, the
capitalism of the body most especially.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Perhaps ironically, it is the friends of commerce (conservatives) who
will most likely see the profaning power of commerce. Critics on the
left mostly attack capitalism because they want more of the very things
that capitalism creates, but believe "big business" is keeping the
fruits of progress from little America. But conservatives realize that
the deeper problem with capitalism is that it creates many things we
should not create in the first place, and may ask us to do many things
we should not do at all.

[Without turning our backs on the modern economy --- a prospect as
foolish as it is impossible --- we need to reconsider the relationship
between modern technology and modern commerce, in the hope that we can
salvage Smith's moderation from Bacon's excesses, and perhaps salvage
better answers to man's permanent questions than simply buying what the
cosmetic surgeon and the neurochemist eagerly want to sell
us.]{.underline}

### Biotech Link Ext. Cards

#### Greed and profit are the main motives for biotech 

**Bhalla**, 20**21** (Bag, author. "Biotechnology greed is prolonging
the pandemic. It's inexcusable." ASBMB. Oct. 30, 2021.
[https://www.asbmb.org/asbmb-today/opinions/103021/biotechnology-greed-is-prolonging-the-pandemic-it
///](https://www.asbmb.org/asbmb-today/opinions/103021/biotechnology-greed-is-prolonging-the-pandemic-it%20///)
MF)

Did greed just save the day? That's what British Prime Minister Boris
Johnson claimed recently[. "[The reason we have]{.mark} the vaccine
[success,]{.mark}" he said in a private call to Conservative members of
Parliament, "[is because of capitalism, [because of
greed.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/mar/23/greed-and-capitalism-behind-jab-success-boris-johnson-tells-mps)]{.mark}"]{.underline}

Despite later backpedaling, Johnson's remark reflects a widely
influential but wildly incoherent view of innovation: [[that greed ---
the unfettered pursuit of profit above all else --- is a necessary
driver of technological progress]{.mark}.]{.underline} Call it the
need-greed theory.

Among the pandemic's many lessons, however, is that greed can easily
work against the common good. [We rightly celebrate the near-miraculous
development of effective vaccines, which have been widely deployed in
rich nations. But the global picture reveals not even a semblance of
justice: As of May, low-income nations received [just 0.3
percent](https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/more-million-covid-deaths-4-months-g7-leaders-failed-break-vaccine-monopolies) of
the global vaccine supply. At this rate it would take 57 years for them
to achieve full vaccination.]{.underline}

This disparity has been dubbed "[vaccine
apartheid](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/g7-must-finance-global-covid19-vaccination-drive-by-gordon-brown-2021-06),"
and it's exacerbated by greed. A year after the launch of the World
Health Organization's Covid-19 Technology Access Pool --- a program
aimed at encouraging the collaborative exchange of intellectual
property, knowledge, and data --- "not a single company has [donated its
technical
knowhow](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/17/covid-vaccine-nationalism-internationalist-approach),"
wrote politicians from India, Kenya, and Bolivia in a June essay for The
Guardian. As of that month, the U.N.-backed COVAX initiative, a vaccine
sharing scheme established to provide developing countries equitable
access, had delivered only about 90 million out of a promised 2 billion
doses. Currently, pharmaceutical companies, lobbyists, and conservative
lawmakers continue to oppose proposals for [patent
waivers](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/29/explainer-what-are-covid-vaccine-patent-waivers) that
would allow local drug makers to manufacture the vaccines without [legal
jeopardy](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/05/05/993998745/biden-backs-waiving-international-patent-protections-for-covid-19-vaccines).
They claim the waivers would [slow down existing
production](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2021/05/07/patent-waivers-wont-impact-big-pharmas-bottom-line-but-could-slow-covid-vaccine-rollouts/?sh=7dc29a6c7862),
"[foster the proliferation of counterfeit
vaccines](https://www.phrma.org/Press-Release/PhRMA-Statement-on-WTO-TRIPS-Intellectual-Property-Waiver),"
and, as North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr said, "undermine the
very [innovation we are
relying](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/05/05/biden-waives-vaccine-patents/) on
to bring this pandemic to an end."

All these views echo the idea that patents and high drug prices are
necessary motivators for biomedical innovation. But examine that logic
closely, and it quickly begins to fall apart.

A great deal of difficult, innovative work is done in industries and
fields that lack patents. Has the lack of patent protections for recipes
led to any dearth of innovation in restaurants? An irritating irony here
is that economists who espouse the need-greed theory themselves innovate
for comparative peanuts. For instance, in 2018, the median compensation
for economists was
about [\$104,000](https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/students/careers/earnings).
The typical pharmaceutical CEO, meanwhile, earned a whopping [\$5.7
million](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biotech-pharma-ceo-employee-pay/554283/) in
total compensation that year. (The hands-on innovators aren't the
need-greeders here; the median compensation for pharmaceutical employees
--- including benefits --- was about \$177,000 in 2018.) Even in Silicon
Valley, writes ever-astute technology insider Tim O'Reilly, \"the notion
that entrepreneurs will stop innovating if they aren't rewarded with
billions is a [pernicious
fantasy](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/two-economies-two-sets-of-rules/).\"

To be sure, it was not greed but rather a vast collaborative effort ---
funded largely with public dollars --- that generated effective
coronavirus vaccines. The technology behind mRNA vaccines such as those
produced by Pfizer and Moderna took decades of work by University of
Pennsylvania scientists you've likely never heard of. According to The
New York Times, one of those scientists, Katalin Kariko, "[never made
more than \$60,000 a
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/health/coronavirus-mrna-kariko.html)"
while doing her innovative foundational research. The researchers at
Oxford University who developed the technology behind AstraZeneca's
vaccine, which was mostly publicly funded, initially set out with the
intention of "[non-exclusive,
royalty-free](https://innovation.ox.ac.uk/technologies-available/technology-licensing/expedited-access-covid-19-related-ip/)"
licensing for their vaccine. Only after pressure to work with a
multinational pharmaceutical company from the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, among others, did
they [renege](https://khn.org/news/rather-than-give-away-its-covid-vaccine-oxford-makes-a-deal-with-drugmaker/) and
license the technology solely to AstraZeneca.

It was astonishing, then, when Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca's CEO, said
that intellectual property, or IP, "is a fundamental part of our
industry and if you don\'t protect IP, then essentially there is no
incentive for anybody to innovate." The Oxford scientists whose work
AstraZeneca licensed literally just innovated without the incentives
Soriot claimed are essential. Why do journalists present need-greeder
claims, [such as
Soriot's](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/patent-pool-potential-covid-19-products-nonsense-pharma-leaders/),
without holding the specific role of profit seeking to account?

It's no secret that innovators (and people generally) often aren't
necessarily greed-driven. For instance, as Walter Isaacson notes in his
book about superstar biochemist Jennifer Doudna\'s work on Crispr gene
manipulation technology, she was never motivated primarily by money. In
fact, he reports that corporate maneuvering over her work made her
\"physically ill.\" Countless cases like hers show that innovations in
science and technology typically aren't the result of genius lightning
strikes but rather of field-wide efforts with multiple teams circling
the same goal. If anyone withdraws for lack of greed-gratifying
incentives, no problem: They're welcome to write themselves out of
history. Others will gladly grasp the glory. And we, the public, lose
nothing.

Perhaps Soriot meant, more generally, that reduced revenues would cut
AstraZeneca's overall research and development (R&D) spending. But even
that claim is detectably dubious. When drug makers claim that high
prices are essential for innovation, they are "[flat out
lying](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/12/financialization-of-the-u-s-pharmaceutical-industry.html)"
financial expert Yves Smith wrote in 2019. Smith cited data published
with the Institute for New Economic Thinking showing that, between 2009
and 2018, 18 drug makers listed in the S&P 500 spent 14 percent more on
stock buybacks and dividends than they did on R&D. These companies could
easily ramp up investments in innovative drugs, the authors wrote,
simply by reining in distributions to shareholders. (Don't forget that
share buybacks were effectively classified as [illegal market
manipulation](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/2/17639762/stock-buybacks-tax-cuts-trump-republicanssi) until
the Securities and Exchange Commission, under Reagan, relaxed the rules
in 1982.)

Of the money that drug companies do invest in R&D, a significant amount
for many goes not toward innovative research but to "finding ways to
suppress generic and biosimilar competition while continuing to raise
prices," according to a [recent
report](https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/COR%20Staff%20Report%20-%20Pharmaceutical%20Industry%20Buybacks%20Dividends%20Compared%20to%20Research.pdf) from
the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform. In these cases,
executive and investor greed demonstrably impede innovation. A
recent [Congressional
hearing](https://twitter.com/RepKatiePorter/status/1394724627566391297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1394724627566391297%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fhouse%2F554329-katie-porter-brings-her-whiteboard-) dramatized
this issue when Rep. Katie Porter, a California Democrat, grilled the
CEO of AbbVie, a biopharmaceutical company which she said spent \$2.45
billion on research and development, \$4.71 billion a year on marketing
and advertising, and [\$50 billion on shareholder
payouts](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/554329-katie-porter-brings-her-whiteboard-to-accuse-pharma-ceo-of-inflating-drug) between
2013 and 2018. She characterized the idea that R&D justified
astronomical prices as "the Big Pharma fairy tale."

[Even if [greed makes sense for some for-profit ventures]{.mark}, it
would be unwise for us to rely only on for-profit enterprise to harness
innovation for social goals.]{.underline} There are many things that we
must do whether they are profitable or not, and the horrific fiasco over
vaccine patents has shown us that biotech executives and other members
of the "thinkerati" are not above putting profits ahead of saving lives.
As White House adviser Anthony Fauci noted to [the
Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/551971-fauci-covid-19-vaccine-patent-waiver-should-not-be-off-the-table) earlier
this year, America has a \"moral obligation" to "make sure that the rest
of the world does not suffer and die" from something that we can help to
prevent. Our government is failing in its duty to act in the public
interest if it allows "your money or your life" to pass as an acceptable
business model.

As an open letter signed by more than a hundred intellectual property
scholars [recently
stated](https://research.kent.ac.uk/socril/ip-scholarship-trips-waiver/),
IP rights (which includes patents) "are not, and have never been,
absolute rights and are granted and recognized under the condition that
they serve the public interest." The scholars noted precedents like last
year's use of the Defense Production Act to increase production of
medical supplies, and the U.S.'s commandeering of penicillin production
during World War II. If Covid-19 vaccine makers refuse to make
life-saving technology publicly available, governments should enact
mandatory licensing or similar measures.

There are also compelling reasons to develop a standing, publicly
operated rapid-response vaccine manufacturing capability. Pfizer's CFO
suggested that prices on vaccines will go up once we are out of the
"[pandemic-pricing
environment](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/pfizer-eyes-higher-covid-19-vaccine-prices-after-pandemic-exec-analyst),"
noting that the company can charge nearly nine times more than they have
been ("\$150, \$175 per dose," the CFO said, versus the \$19.50 Pfizer
is charging the U.S. in one supply deal). Even if those who haven't
received a single dose of the vaccine never do, that could mean roughly
a \$30 billion bonanza from U.S. booster shots alone. Patient advocates
estimate that it would cost [just \$4
billion](https://theweek.com/articles/981550/how-joe-biden-could-vaccinate-world) for
the U.S. to set up a public-private operation capable of manufacturing
enough mRNA vaccines to immunize the whole planet, with each shot
costing \$2. This would be a great way for America to show global
leadership, and would surely be way cheaper, both individually and
collectively, than being annually "Pfizered." Plus, the usefulness of
such a facility would long outlast the current pandemic, with climate
change making zoonotic spillover events more likely (not to mention the
risks of weaponized viruses). Covid-19 was our "[starter
pandemic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/10/coronavirus-election/616884/),"
as Ed Yong usefully dubbed it.

[[If greed-driven companies fail to exercise their powers responsibly,
they should face competition from the public sector. President Biden let
the cat out of the bag when [he
said](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/07/09/remarks-by-president-biden-at-signing-of-an-executive-order-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/) that
"capitalism without competition isn\'t capitalism; it\'s
exploitation]{.mark}."]{.underline} While many people applauded his
sentiment, stop and think about the implication: The president was, in
essence, saying that we expect corporations to exploit us if given half
a chance.

We pay a huge price in blood and treasure when we give the need-greeders
free rein to lie to and exploit the public with impunity. We must be
clear-eyed about exactly when greed can help our collective interests
and when it hinders them. During a crisis as dire as a global pandemic,
greed won't save us.

#### Mainstream bioethics are replicating the ideological discourse of neoliberalism

influenced by neoliberal market ideology. The market is regarded as the
main source of vulnerability and insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark} (Kirby,
2006; Thomas, 2007). [[Neoliberal policies are multiplying insecurities:
less and more precarious employment, deterioration of working
conditions, financial instability, growth of poverty,]{.mark} and
[environmental degradation]{.mark}. They also lead to the [breakdown
of]{.mark} protective mechanisms; [safety networks and solidarity
arrangements that existed to protect vulnerable subjects]{.mark} have
been minimized or eliminated. [Rules and regulations protecting society
as well as the environment are weakened in order to promote global
market expansion.]{.mark} As a result, precariousness has generally
expanded. [**This is precisely what the ideology wants to accomplish**:
people only flourish if they are confronted with challenges, if there is
the possibility of competition.]{.mark} Individual security is "a matter
of individual choice"]{.underline} (Harvey, 2005: 168). [[It is exactly
this ideological discourse that is replicated in mainstream bioethics'
interpretation of vulnerability as deficient autonomy. But if, on the
contrary, vulnerability is regarded as the result of the damaging impact
of the global logic of neoliberalism, a different approach will
emerge.]{.underline}]{.mark} It is not surprising that the language of
vulnerability is often used by international and intergovernmental
organizations. [[The devastating effects of neoliberal policies are most
visible in the developing world. But nowadays, **existential insecurity
is everywhere**. It is also obvious that market ideology has not in fact
increasing human welfare. It has mainly promoted increasing
inequality.]{.mark} It has created a world in which the 85 richest
persons have as many financial resources as the 3.5 billion poorest
people]{.underline} (Oxfam 2014). A small elite has appropriated the
political process and has bended the rules of the economic system for
its own benefit. Read the story of Iceland; in the 1970s and 1980s an
egalitarian country with a rapidly growing economy. Neoliberal policies
and privatization of the banking system in 1998- 2003 resulted in fast
enrichment of a small elite but massive indebtedness of the country so
that in 2004 it had the highest national debt in the world (Reid, 2014).
[[When bioethics discourse was initiated and expanded during the 1970s
and 1980s]{.mark} the [major moral challenges were related to the power
of science and technology.]{.mark} How can patients be protected against
medical interference and paternalism? How can citizens have more control
over healthcare decisions? In what ways can patients' rights be defined
and implemented? [These questions have shaped the agenda and methodology
of mainstream bioethics, especially in more developed countries. But in
a global perspective, many citizens do not have access to modern science
and technology. They are marginalized in a system that is increasingly
privatized and commercialized. They are exploited in clinical research
projects since it is their only change to receive treatment and
care.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is obvious that in this perspective,
especially since 1990s the major moral challenges have changed. [[It is
no longer the power of science and technology that produces ethical
problems but the power of money. Healthcare, research,
education]{.mark}, and even culture and religion [are regarded as
businesses that are competing for consumers.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Biotech innovation proliferates capitalist corporation exploitation -- recent vaccines prove

**Whyte** Professor of Socio-legal Studies at the School of Law and

\[David Whyte, Vaccinating Capitalism: corporate pharma raids the
commons and leaves the root causes untreated, Corporate Watch,

//1LEE\]

The vaccines developed to deal with COVID-19 have undoubtedly given us a
unique springboard to develop other vaccines in future. Yet
**[this]{.underline}** **[does not make up for years of neglect. We
started]{.underline}** from **[a low knowledge base about COVID-19
precisely because the big four had calculated that developing vaccines
for the earlier coronaviruses was not worth the portfolio
risk.]{.underline}**

Our earlier Vaccinating Capitalism report on the profits being made by
the main vaccine producers shows how this time portfolio risk was taken
out of the equation. The reason the COVID-**[19 vaccines arrived
at]{.underline}** such warp **[speed is that the risk model changed
overnight]{.underline}**. Indeed, the normal risks associated with
vaccine development were almost completely removed from investors.
First, **[research and development]{.underline}**, combined with direct
subsidies, were mobilised on an unprecedented scale. Second,
**[governments used our money to place the biggest]{.underline}** drug
**[advance orders in history and remove all market risk from future
sales]{.underline}**. Those two things prompted an unprecedented
single-purpose investment in the sector. This unprecedented investment
will, of course, be followed by unprecedented profits.

The development of this **[[vaccine is part of a vast system of public
subsidy that deceives the public into thinking that it is private
capital]{.mark} in the form of Big Pharma [that saves us through its
innovation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Yet perhaps the biggest subsidy to
those companies is hidden.

Universities provide trained scientists, a foundation of knowledge that
has been built up over hundreds of years. It is in universities that the
rules for clinical research are developed, and it is university
researchers who establish the system of peer review and publish results
in academic journals. Universities make the largest social contribution
to verifying and disseminating scientific breakthroughs. It is knowledge
that we hold in common. Part of the 'commons' it may be, but in economic
terms, this knowledge production counts as an 'externality': an
invisible subsidy that never shows up on a corporate balance sheet.

The **[infrastructure that produced the vaccines was nurtured in
publicly funded universities, in public institutes and in heavily
subsidised private labs.]{.underline}** When we recognise this, we
realise that it **[is we who are saving Big Pharma from its failure to
develop an effective vaccine against similar viruses in the first
place]{.underline}**.

VACCINATING CAPITALISM

**[Most infectious [disease]{.mark} experts expect that new viral
diseases [resulting from zoonotic 'spillover']{.mark}]{.underline}** --
moving from animals to humans -- **[[will become ever more
frequent]{.mark}]{.underline}** occurrences. SARS-Cov-19 is not the
first case, and we are likely to face many more. There are difficult
issues that we need to face regarding this unprecedented vaccination
programme: how it allows governments to avoid tackling the root causes
of SARS-Cov-2, and indeed may help weaken our defences against the next
pathogen that spreads from animals to humans.

We know some of the main drivers of spillover. One is deforestation. New
pathogens are released when land that has been left relatively
un-touched is cleared for development and industrial use by humans. Once
wild animals carrying those pathogens are displaced, the pathogens then
need to maximise the opportunity to 'leap' from one species to another
in a process of genetic drift. This is not an easy process. But, as
writers like Rob Wallace have been warning us for years, large scale
industrial farming can vastly increase the chances of a virus mutating
into a form that can make the leap. Once it is in the human pool, it
finds its most fertile conditions in closely packed workplaces like
factories, warehouses and call centres.

**[[The problem is that it is not just us who are being vaccinated but
capitalism itself]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The danger is that the
**[[vaccines will merely provide a short-term "technofix" which helps
ensure the survival of the system that keeps on killing
us]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The entire **[public funding effort]{.underline}** -- furlough,
government loans, suspension of the normal regulatory rules -- **[has
had one primary aim: to keep corporations on life
support]{.underline}**. Some of our most damaging and irresponsible
corporations have been kept alive by public funding, often in ways that
have allowed them to sack workers, rip-off customers, and profit from
intensifying poverty. Meanwhile, **[the [Covid
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}** (despite all the celebratory news about
falling pollution levels) **[has also been [used to weaken efforts
against climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Corporations in Europe
and North America have taken the opportunity to lobby hard -- with some
success -- for environmental deregulation and further weakening of Paris
Agreement targets.

The **[[development of the vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark}** will save
many lives, but there **[[is a price to pay]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
**[[profit-maximising, risk-minimising model ensures that
we]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not the corporations, will ultimately **[[end
up paying the]{.mark} financial [costs]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But there
is an even higher social cost that might be paid. If we don't deal with
the root causes of the problem, and simply continue to reproduce the
same uncontrolled conditions of capitalist development and industrial
farming, then we will keep being exposed to more and more zoonotic
pathogens long after we have got rid of this one.

**[The moment is ripe]{.underline}** because of the **[[surging
corporate interest]{.mark} in and applications of machine learning
[and]{.mark} other new [branches of AI research]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[Major [info-tech companies]{.mark} have come to [see]{.mark} the
[cognitive and]{.mark} [biological limits of the human as a
barrier]{.mark} to accumulation, and [glimpse]{.mark} the [possibilities
of smashing]{.mark} through [that obstacle]{.mark} with machine
learning, advanced robotics, and other "fourth industrial revolution"
technologies.]{.underline}** AI today is still in a rudimentary phase,
limited to narrow, domain-specific applications, very far from the
human-equivalent or human-exceeding general AI that remains the stuff of
sci-fi imaginaries, although it is also the target of some serious
research programs. **[Nevertheless, in this restricted form [AI
permeates]{.mark} everyday [life]{.mark}, in the Global Northwest, in
China, and to some degree globally]{.underline}**: its algorithms
organize social media feeds, financial activities, virtual games,
workplace monitoring, welfare systems, and police surveillance. **[[We
are now in]{.mark} what I and my co-authors, Atle Mikkola Kjøsen and
James Steinhoff, term "[actually-existing AI capitalism]{.mark}." Its
[tech]{.mark}nologies [will]{.mark} likely continue to [encroach
on]{.mark} what we have thought of as exclusively [human
capacities]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and be applied across a steadily
broadening spectrum of activities. As James Steinhoff speculates, **[[AI

commercial activity, as steam engines and railways were in the 19th

process is unfolding almost entirely under the direction of giant
oligopolistic corporations]{.underline}** **[--- Google, Microsoft, IBM,
Amazon, Facebook, Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu]{.underline}** --- with help
thrown in by governments eager for AI's national security state
applications. Marx would have understood this very well**[. So [we need
a Marxist critique of AI]{.mark}, as what is probably the prime
contemporary example of profit-driven and revolt-suppressing
appropriation and direction of techno-scientific
knowledge.]{.underline}** But this process is also throwing into doubt
the humanist assumptions built into Marx's concept of labor: so we also
need to critique Marxism from the viewpoint of AI.

#### Markets\-\--the affirmative expands NATO control which is based on "markets" and "freedom" - Neg reads yellow

**1AC, Gilli, 2020 - Senior Researcher at the NATO Defense College**
\[Andrea, NDC Research Paper No.15 -- December ""NATO-Mation":
Strategies for Leading in the Age of Artificial Intelligence"
https://www.ndc.nato.int/news/news.php?icode=1514 Acc 4/21/22 TA\]

Artificial Intelligence, machine learning and big data represent some,
but not the only, instances of technological progress. In contrast to
other realms of technology, however, **[artificial intelligence bodes
far-reaching ramifications across all areas of society,]{.underline}**
the economy, **[and the military, on account of its ubiquitous nature
that enables pervasive diffusion]{.underline}**. When major
technological changes occur, governments usually step in to update
regulations or introduce ethical rules to help align incentives among
different actors. Some measures include providing key complementary
goods and services, which the market may otherwise undersupply.
Governments also draw strategic directions. **[The Atlantic Alliance
is]{.underline}** encountering a major challenge; but is also
**[standing before a potent opportunity to shape the future security
environment, thereby preserving]{.underline}** the freedom and
well-being of its Allies' citizens, and maintaining **[its technological
leadership]{.underline}**. **[One possible way forward consists of
pursuing the NATO-mation agenda]{.underline}** described in this report:
**[a set]{.underline}** of individual and collective initiatives,
**[joint solutions and coordinated actions spanning]{.underline}**
across several fields and domains and at different levels. This Research
Paper has highlighted 11 different areas where action is possible and
desirable. Challenges, dynamics, actors and constraints differ in each
area, but **[NATO can play a significant role as both as initiator and
as coordinator. In the ethics domain, NATO has an interest in upholding
its founding values]{.underline}**. Innovation-wise, there is a strong
rationale for the Alliance to identify or even create an internal actor
to champion AI as well as to help Allies generate an innovative
workforce and pioneer more modern work environments. Change, however, is
difficult. Innovation, if history has any lesson to spare, is even more
difficult. Launching pilot projects can help subdue scepticism and
temper the understandably reluctant attitude of some, all the while
fostering greater familiarity with new technologies. While the
transformation we are observing is technology-driven, its main
repercussions will be on human beings, their ideas, their norms and
their organizations. In addition to ushering in an innovative workplace
and an innovative workforce, **[experimentation will be necessary
to]{.underline}** accept, understand and **[improve novel
technologies]{.underline}**, **[as well as to steer their evolution to
fulfil ethical considerations]{.underline}**, alongside tactical,
operational and strategic necessities. Traditionally, **[NATO has played
a significant part in this respect and, if anything, should continue and
probably expand this role further.]{.underline}** NATO Allies have,
however, a broader opportunity to shape the evolution of AI-related
technologies both through increasing R&D spending and through targeted
investments. The bulk of AI research is driven by the private sector.
Most observers worry that this has deprived military establishments of
the control over new technologies. Private-sector driven research, at
least in the realm of AI, has several drawbacks, including a short-term
and narrow focus, and a reliance on economically, technologically and
environmentally unsustainable solutions. There is a role for NATO-wide
coordinated public action and investments, and eventual concertation
with the European Union, in tackling these issues. Similarly, Allies
will soon have to contemplate and prepare for the infrastructures on
which AI systems will run: quantum and cloud computing as well as 5G
networks warrant closer scrutiny. Whether NATO should provide cloud
computing the way it does through AWACS aircraft, airspace management,
is however, another issue. Historically, NATO has delivered collective
defence with a strong attention to arms control. Whilst not an easy
endeavour with immediate payoffs, the Alliance can contribute to ongoing
debates on how to reach the goal of preserving international stability.
**[NATO armed forces, combined, are more than the sum of the single
parts: this is attributable to interoperability. In the NATO context,
standardization plays a critical role: coordination among Allies is
important,]{.underline}** both within the Alliance and without, such as
in Standards Development Organizations (SDOs). **[[The]{.mark} Atlantic
[Alliance]{.mark} won the Cold War]{.underline}** and overcame the
challenges it faced in the ensuing decades **[because of the bonds among
the Allies. Such [bonds are]{.mark}]{.underline}** not primarily
political, military or diplomatic: they are
**[[cultural]{.underline}]{.mark}**, ideological **[and
ethical]{.underline}**, **[and are [based on the founding
principles]{.mark}]{.underline}** on which the Alliance was built.
Democracy, rule of law, **[human rights]{.underline}**, and **[[free
markets]{.underline}]{.mark}** have guaranteed the longevity of
transatlantic relations. AI technologies, through deep-fakes, may
undermine those values. This is an insidious challenge which, however,
may also one day prove existential. This is why NATO must be poised to
play a key role in this technological realm.

THIS week foreign ministers from Nato countries are in Washington DC for
a series of events to mark the 70th anniversary of the **[North Atlantic
Treaty]{.underline}**. Signed in that city on April 4 1949 by the US,
Canada, Britain, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy,
Portugal, Denmark, Iceland and Norway**[, [it]{.mark} [was]{.mark} the
first military treaty [binding together the US]{.mark}, key imperialist
[states in Europe and their allies]{.mark} on both sides of the Atlantic
to pursue what Winston [Churchill]{.mark} had [referred to]{.mark} in
his Fulton, Missouri speech in 1946 [as the US-led]{.mark} "overall
[strategic concept]{.mark}."]{.underline}** However dressed up, **[[the
plan was to secure the]{.mark} post-war [world for monopoly
capitalism]{.mark}, [bring down the Soviet Union and socialist
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}** of eastern Europe **[[and crush any
green shoots of socialism]{.underline}]{.mark}** wherever they might
spring up **[--- in the heartlands of imperialism or in the newly
liberated]{.underline}** former **[colonies]{.underline}**. Article 5 of
the Treaty provided for mutual assistance should any member be attacked.
**[[The Soviet Union was cast as]{.mark} an [existential]{.mark}
threat]{.underline}** --- **[though all]{.underline}** its **[energy was
directed towards rapid post-war reconstruction]{.underline}**, securing
international arms reduction agreements, banning the use of nuclear
weapons and achieving peaceful coexistence. **[[The]{.mark} mass [media
whipped up fear]{.mark} of communism and of imminent
attack]{.underline}** through conventional warfare and weapons of mass
destruction to be unleashed by the Kremlin and its Red Army.
**[[The]{.mark} t[reaty]{.mark} and media-induced panic
[facilitated]{.mark} the [moulding of]{.mark} Western [Europe]{.mark} as
a vast military bloc, the [maintenance of huge armies]{.mark} with
extensive periods of national conscription,]{.underline}** the
proliferation of US and other military bases in Britain and elsewhere
**[and [the deployment of]{.mark} US [troops and warplanes]{.mark}. It
also stimulated soaring expenditure]{.underline}** on research into ever
more lethal warfare, **[eating up the government science
budgets]{.underline}** of member countries which could have been
directed to meeting people's needs. **[In Britain, government
spending]{.underline}** on science **[increased from £5 million in 1937
to £78m]{.underline}** in 1947 to £234m in 1953, 80 per cent of which
was warfare-related. **[[It]{.mark} engaged the Soviet
Union]{.underline}** in an unwanted and economically devastating arms
race, forced the formation of the Warsaw Pact alliance for the
self-defence of the socialist countries in 1955**[, and [terrorised
the]{.mark} whole [world]{.mark}]{.underline}** with the threat of
nuclear annihilation --- anything by any method to halt the progress of
socialism. These developments did not, of course, come out of nowhere.
**[[While the war]{.mark} still [raged]{.mark} across the continents
[and]{.mark} [people]{.mark} everywhere [hoped for peace, democracy and
freedom]{.mark} from colonial oppression, [imperialism was
laying]{.mark} the [foundations of a]{.mark} very [different
world]{.mark}]{.underline}** that would meet its need for hegemonic
control of resources, labour and markets once the current hostilities
had ceased. Winston Churchill was on the case on behalf of the
right-wing British establishment before the ink had even time to dry on
the document bringing war in Europe to a halt. On May 9 1945 in Berlin,
the German high command formally ratified the instrument of total and
unconditional surrender. Duplicitous Churchill told Stalin that the
future of humanity depended "on the friendship and understanding between
the British and Russian peoples," to which, on May 10,
**[[Stalin]{.mark} replied, [looki]{.mark}ng [forward to]{.mark} "the
[further successful]{.mark} and happy [development]{.mark} in the
post-war period of the friendly relations [which have grown up]{.mark}
between our countries in the period of the war."]{.underline}**

#### Discourse\-\--Discourse surrounding NATO and how it can be used for "security cooperation" allows for the expansion of the capitalist alliance, justifying imperialism\-\--their attempt to do something good masks NATO's various atrocities in the past and attempts to make NATO appear as good when it is in fact a flawed alliance. In other words, the affirmative puts a "band-aid" over a machine gun wound to the stomach. 

#### Expansion\-\--Their attempts to cause NATO modelling links in two ways: the first is that it expands capitalist control over the world as Western imperialism is adopted in new markets\-\--that spreads capitalism and gives elites control over materials from other countries\-\--the second way is that their discourse of modelling presents the idea that the West is a shining city on the hill that other countries should "model". That justifies imperialism, colonialism, and capitalist expansion.

Just like with the commercial and public sector, then,
**[[tech]{.mark}nological progress [has allowed militaries]{.mark} and
[security sector professionals]{.mark} to gather [large amounts of
data,]{.mark} and a number of [countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(governments and armed forces**[) [are]{.mark} [in the process of
constructing]{.mark} and implementing [governance]{.mark} models [to
ensure the benefits of Big Data]{.mark} in terms of real time
intelligence, enhanced decision-making, situational awareness and
[overall competitive edge]{.mark} against increasingly capable
opponents. The synergy between [Big Data]{.mark}]{.underline}**, ML
**[and [AI is particularly important]{.mark} in this context when it
comes [to]{.mark} all aspects of [combat readiness]{.mark}, with experts
agreeing that [AI]{.mark} and its application in the armed forces [is
"present in all]{.mark} domains...and all [levels of
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (Svenmarck et al., 2018)
**[[with]{.mark} the [potential to have a transformative impact]{.mark}
on national security technology]{.underline}** (Allen and Chan, 2017;
see also Tonin, 2019). **[[Many]{.mark}, however, [are at an early stage
in]{.mark} the [development of]{.mark} any [BDA
strategy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Thus]{.underline}**, the
**[lessons]{.underline}** from other sectors -- and indeed leading
governments and security organizations -- **[can [provide guidance on
best practice]{.mark} as they move from their 'data' governance models
to 'Big Data' governance frameworks that will give them the ability to
ensure maximum value and advantage is extrapolated from the BDA
life-cycle]{.underline}**.

**[The [first]{.mark}]{.underline}** lesson or **[best practice relates
to having a clear rationale, goals and guiding principles in place to
ensure effective governance of Big Data in the
organization.]{.underline}** This includes strategically assessing the
type of model required, based on current capabilities, resources and
future needs, i.e. decentralized/centralized/hybrid. More importantly,
governments and **[security organizations need a clear understanding of
the value of Big Data across different domains (land, sea, air) and
landscapes (human, physical, information) so that high quality, usable,
real-time information can be delivered through AI]{.underline}** and ML
**[at strategic, tactical and operational levels]{.underline}**. **[This
is certainly recognized in [the NATO]{.mark} context]{.underline}**,
with a Dutch Position Paper highlighting **[that, in terms of Big Data
and [AI]{.mark}, "the [focus should be]{.mark} on [assessing
and...demonstrating]{.mark} the added [value]{.mark} that innovations
can provide to NATO military theatres"]{.underline}** (Smallgange et
al., 2018). **[This is critical, so that the full possibilities of
influencing the three landscapes]{.underline}** -- **[through
situational awareness and effective command and control]{.underline}**
-- **[can be developed in a broader way than]{.underline}** that offered
by **[traditional military means]{.underline}**. This way, there is also
a recognition that in order **[[to take full advantage]{.mark}
of]{.underline}** the data-centric technologies (**[BDA and
AI]{.underline}**), **[[a data-centric methodology is required,
so]{.mark} that [effective support can be offered at different
levels]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}(Blunt et al., 2018).

In the **[[second]{.underline}]{.mark}** place, related to the first
lesson learned, **[in a military and security context where there is
often a unified command in combination with tiered formal hierarchy that
tends towards specialization, there can also be [structural
inefficiencies in the flow of information]{.mark}]{.underline}**;
**[operating jointly can thus often [come at a high
cost]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Zelaya and Keeley, 2020). When
**[[consider]{.mark}ing any data-driven methodology, then, much
[thought]{.mark} has to be [given to]{.mark} the organizational data
management life cycle -- including [how to integrate]{.mark} the use of
BDA and [new tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}** (e.g.
**[[AI]{.mark},]{.underline}** ML) **[[with]{.mark} human
[decision-making]{.mark}, control and communication of
information]{.underline}**. Indeed, it has been argued that **[[whilst
BDA]{.underline}]{.mark}** and associated technologies **[[offer]{.mark}
significant [advances]{.mark}]{.underline}** in rapidly collecting,
processing and deciphering complex forms and varieties of data for the
purposes of action, **[[the human element is]{.mark} still
[critical]{.mark} in contextualizing any such data and offering insights
on the complexity and "shades of grey" that might be missed by
BDA]{.underline}** (Van Puyvelde et al., 2018: 1414; see also Desclaux,
2018: 9). To this end, **[thought has already been given to the
implementation of the Observe, Orient, Decide, Act (OODA) loop to
determine the type of decision support required and how [meaningful
human control can be enabled]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The OODA
perspective or approach, it is argued, represents "the life cycle from
data acquisition to decision making and also reflects how sophisticated
a technology should be in order to provide value" (Smallgange et al.,
2017: 6). An important element within this loop is giving full
consideration to any legal, ethical and moral questions that arise in
relation to action and particularly the use of lethal autonomous weapon
systems (LAWS).

The **[[third]{.underline}]{.mark}** best practice relates to **[buy-in
from the organization as a whole.]{.underline}** That **[means [not
just]{.mark} having the [tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}**, tools and
mechanisms in place within a data driven environment that ensures access
to and use of Big Data for all team members, **[[but]{.mark}
also]{.underline}**: a) **[Leadership]{.underline}** from those at the
top (Commanders) and within the different echelons of command within and
across domains, landscapes and levels through to data engineers,
analysts, assessors, translators -- **[and the ability]{.underline}** of

in an effective way]{.underline}**; b) **[The [creation of]{.mark} an

relevant staff are data literate, have the requisite [skills]{.mark},
[literacy and readiness]{.mark}, and are provided with the education,
training and skills to operate effectively]{.underline}**. **[To this
end, [NATO has]{.mark} identified [a key capability gap]{.mark} [when it
comes to literacy and readiness]{.mark} and has also recognized that in
terms of [recruiting AI specialists]{.mark}, engineers and data
scientists the pool of talent is shallow and it [can be
difficult]{.mark} to compete with Big Tech companies]{.underline}**.

Here, leading **[national governments]{.underline}** in developing their
Big Data strategies **[have sought to ensure the [requisite
investment]{.mark} is in place going forward for developing
a]{.underline}** (resilient, secure and trusted) **[technology
architecture and recruiting the right talent]{.underline}**. They have
also, alongside leading security organizations such as **[[NATO,
recognized]{.mark} that [partnerships]{.mark}]{.underline}** (in
particular [**[with]{.underline}** **[industry]{.underline}**]{.mark})
and contracted services, **[as well as in-house
expertise]{.underline}**, that **[[will be needed to]{.mark} deliver and
[sustain]{.mark} the necessary [skills and]{.mark} understanding for
assessing, interpreting and communicating [information]{.mark} in an
effective way]{.underline}** (Tonin, 2019; Blunt, 2018; Defence IQ,
2020; Big Data for Defence, 2019). Finally, **[the non-defense
commercial/industry sector will not just be important in terms of the
skills and expertise element, but also for technological adaptation and
integration, given that many [innovations stem from commercial
companies]{.mark}; the [UK]{.mark} government, for example, has [awarded
IBM]{.mark} a GBP [3.8 million]{.mark} deal for the development of an
AI-powered military software platform prototype (Defence IQ,
2020).]{.underline}** More broadly, **[governments and security sector
organizations will have to overcome certain hurdles]{.underline}** --
organizational, cultural, and incentive structures -- **[to
ensure]{.underline}** that **[new technologies are adapted so they can
bring advantages across strategic, tactical and operational
levels]{.underline}** (Kostopoulos, 2019: 9) and allow efficient and
effective decision-making when needed.

Conclusions This chapter has highlighted the central ways in which
**[[commercial organizations]{.mark} have been [successful in
constructing]{.mark} and executing a BDA
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and discussed the main pitfalls that
organizations should seek to avoid in embarking on any such strategy. In
this context it is clear that there are many lessons to be learnt and
best practices that can be adapted by the security sector in relation
the integration of BDA into existing strategies. Indeed, **[a cursory
look]{.underline}** at the leading nations **[with regards to Big Data
strategies]{.underline}** -- and security organizations **[such as
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- **[demonstrate that their central
[objectives have been developed]{.mark} (and appropriately adapted)
[with commercial best practice in mind]{.mark} in relation to data
management, governance and analytics]{.underline}**.

**[To this end, there are general principles for success that are
underpinned by a need for a clear rationale, goals and strategy, a
strong leadership, an agile, resilient, secure and adaptable technical
infrastructure, a data-centric approach and methodology, and a data
culture that permeates the whole organization]{.underline}**. Of course,
this chapter did not have the space or scope to discuss the micro-level
BDA requirements within the security sector in relation to all
dimensions, and in particular innovative hardware and software
architectures or indeed process techniques and challenges.

What is clear **[[going forward]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, is that
**[the security sector will face challenges of a technical and
nontechnical nature that [will require financial investments in AI
systems and human talent]{.mark}, as well as cooperation [and]{.mark}
[collaboration with industry]{.mark} and leadership, [if]{.mark} BDA
[strategies are to deliver]{.mark} the [advantages]{.mark} expected to
those engaged at strategic, tactical [and]{.mark} operational
levels]{.underline}**. In this, lead nations and
**[organizations]{.underline}**, **[whilst not starting from scratch,
have clearly started to [negotiate the steep learning curve]{.mark} when
it comes to Big Data and decision-making]{.underline}** (Street et al.,
2019). **[[They are at a formative phase of development with regards
to]{.mark} constructing and implementing [strategies]{.mark} and
governance frameworks, and indeed modelling and simulation environments,
tools and techniques to allow them [to derive maximum value from Big
Data]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[The journey
ahead]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, whilst entailing certain risks,
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[an
opportunity]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- if objectives and goals are
clearly defined, strategies grown and adapted according to ever-changing
needs, data and technological environments, and data governance and
management practices enabled by strong leadership are underpinned by a
philosophy of date-centric methodology, technology and clear legal and
ethical code of conduct. **[[Testing (through
exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}**, simulations, etc.), **[failure and the
ability to reflect]{.underline}** **[[are important components of
evolving]{.underline}]{.mark}** and (re)defining **[[BDA governance
so]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[real value can be extracted in real
time]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[with trustworthy]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and accurate **[[data]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[and systems,
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology **[[and skills]{.underline}]{.mark}**
required to exploit data all the way through **[the decision-making
process [are sustained]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[Digital revolution]{.mark} has substantially transformed the world
we live in, [provid]{.mark}ing great [opportunities but]{.mark} also
[mak]{.mark}ing [societies]{.mark} more [vulnerable]{.mark} and
transforming the meaning of state borders.
[Tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nology **[[makes]{.mark} external
[interference]{.mark}s [cheaper, faster and
all-encompassing]{.mark}]{.underline}**: citizens can potentially become
direct targets of information warfare, all members of a society can be
part of conflicts one way or another. **[From advanced weaponry to
command and control, most security-related domains are undergoing deep
transformations as data availability and transmission increase
exponentially]{.underline}**. This is **[especially]{.underline}** true
**[as]{.underline}** the emergence of so-called **[[hybrid
tactics]{.underline}]{.mark}** contributes to **[[universalize the
battlefield]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Also, **[[attackers may lose control
of]{.mark} their offensive [cyber weapons, and 'collateral damages'
across the private sector]{.mark} and the public [worldwide might
be]{.mark} more and more [difficult to contain]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Less visible, yet important challenges connected with Information
Communication Technologies (ICTs) also exist. For instance,
**[[data]{.mark} [overload can create problems for
decisionmakers]{.mark}]{.underline}** that are **[unable to detect
important signals]{.underline}**. Losing sight of how machines make
their calculations -- a somewhat inherent feature of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) -- can hinder deeper understanding of phenomena as
well as learning, besides having dense ethical implications.

[**[A crucial question for Western societies and
governments]{.underline}** **[is how to]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[deal
with technological changes by [exploit]{.mark}ing their many
[benefits]{.mark} [while managing]{.mark} to limit their
[risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Broadly speaking, observers have long
noticed the potentialities of technologies in the security domain:
**[better [situational awareness]{.mark}, [early warning]{.mark} against
threats and risks, [the ability to]{.mark} prevent and/or [stop
attacks]{.mark} to happen, the [use of tech]{.mark}nology
[against]{.mark} the [adversaries']{.mark} own technologies,
[and]{.mark} eventually [deterrence of]{.mark} high-end [hybrid
warfare]{.mark} or, at least, the increase of resilience against
it.]{.underline}** In particular, in order **[[to harness]{.mark} the
potential of new [tech]{.mark}nologies, [higher levels of
security]{.mark} are [needed]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While internet is
unfortunately not secure by design, it has to be somehow retrofit to
guarantee a certain level of protection -- for instance by avoiding a
single point of failure, developing better firewalls, etc. Ultimately,
**[[the digital revolution poses challenges]{.mark} to decision makers
both as potential users of new technologies and as leaders of targeted
societies. [Learning to achieve]{.mark} political [aims]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} the support of [tech]{.mark}nological innovations [and
at the same time]{.mark} acquiring the ability to [prevent]{.mark} and
manage interferences, if not [attacks]{.mark}, [have become
paramount]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

However, **[achieving such [results is not only]{.mark} about
[engineering]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Tech]{.mark}nologies
[need]{.mark} ad hoc [governance, organizations and skilled
users]{.mark} to properly function]{.underline}**. Actually, **[history
is full of examples of good technologies that were improperly used
and/or unable to provide the expected gains]{.underline}**. Therefore, a
**[[joint, multi-disciplinary effort]{.mark}s [is needed]{.mark} to
think and manage technologies in a more comprehensive and secure way
across various domains]{.underline}**. For instance, the very same
design of **[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}** needs exchanges with social
scientists in order to limit analytical biases and increase the quality
of data that will then be processed through Machine Learning (ML).
Moreover, many public policies involve technologies with a strong
security dimension. This is one of the main reasons **[[security
standards should be harmonized across]{.mark} individual government's
policies as well as among [Allies]{.mark}:]{.underline}** **[this is
what has been leading NATO's renewed efforts on standardization beyond
the strictly military perimeter, for instance towards the 5G
domain.]{.underline}**

**[While digital technologies]{.underline}** continue to **[dramatically
increase in scope and relevance, [they are deeply embedded in]{.mark}to
[the broader geopolitical framework]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[with the
re-emergence of multipolarism and looming great power
confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This connection has to be
discussed and understood as it affects not only security but also
economic and technological domains. **[The [globalized supply chain of
technology]{.mark} building block entails vulnerabilities and
dependencies on unreliable suppliers. Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs)
in hightech companies, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and critical
infrastructures are [guided]{.mark} not only [by]{.mark} an [economic
rationale]{.mark}]{.underline} but also by a politico-military one, and
have to be monitored accordingly. [Cyber space]{.underline}** and,
partly, outer space **[are de facto unregulated global commons where the
ability to set regulations and [standards could be a matter of
competition and/or cooperation]{.mark} among major countries
worldwide]{.underline}**. **[The notions of 'whole-of-government' and
'whole-of-society' approaches confirm that [these]{.mark} problems
[should be dealt with comprehensive strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[Great and middle powers]{.underline}** increasingly **[rely on
[stand-off weapons]{.mark}, both physical and cyber ones,]{.underline}**
able **[[to create damages rapidly, worldwide and on a large
scale]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[This]{.underline}** trend **[[is going
to be]{.mark} [accelerated by AI.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[Some
countries are adopting principles]{.mark} on responsible use of
AI]{.underline}**, including in terms of control and accountability.
**[[However, a vacuum remains in international
law]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And **[[such vacuum is]{.mark} more
[difficult to fill because of]{.mark} the aforementioned [interaction
between geopolitics and tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}**.
**[[Different powers conceive tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}** -- and
what it can bring them in terms of benefits -- **[[in different ways,
and]{.mark} they [are unwilling to regulate internationally this field
of competition and warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**[In such a rapidly changing security environment,
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** and allied **[[activities directly]{.mark}
or indirectly [defend]{.mark} citizens' daily life]{.underline}**.
[**[In]{.underline}** **[the age of]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[Big Data,
[AI]{.mark} and the pervasive use of [internet]{.mark}, the challenge is
to defend the ever-expanding information environment while maintaining
all its [functionalities]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[Against this backdrop]{.underline}**, in the post-Cold War period
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** somehow **[[missed the
opportunity]{.mark} to involve Allies and partners [in]{.mark} a debate
on how defense technologies and [norms]{.mark} have been changing
[with]{.mark} the [ICT]{.mark} revolution]{.underline}**. **[[The result
is]{.mark} that [the web is not secure]{.mark} by design, [and]{.mark}
both private and public [actors struggle to mitigate risks]{.mark} and
threats in an unregulated environment where attackers are structurally
advantaged over defenders]{.underline}**. **[Today, [the Alliance should
not miss the opportunity twice vis-à-vis]{.mark} Big Data, [AI]{.mark}
and,]{.underline}** broadly speaking, **[the current and future
(r)evolution of ICT]{.underline}**. The aim of the 2020 Academic
Conference was precisely to explore some fundamental aspects of the
challenges and opportunities posed by technological change to the
security environment in which NATO works. Below follows a brief
introduction to NATO, cyber defense and three sets of issues
investigated in closer detail: Big Data and decision-making; hybrid
threats to allied decision-making; AI adoption by allied armed forces.

**[[NATO]{.mark}, Cyber Defense]{.underline}** and Emerging Disruptive
Technologies NATO begun to focus on cyber defense already in 2008, and
over time it **[[built up institutions]{.mark} and frameworks [to deal
with it from a well-limited military perspective]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[Allies recognized a cyber attack could lead to]{.underline}** the
activation of **[Article 5]{.underline}** of the Washington Treaty on
collective defense. **[In that case, there is a clear procedure where
NATO authorities take the military lead. Article 5 does not prescribe a
clear procedure factoring in new technologies]{.underline}**. On a
regular basis, headquarters and the Secretary General cabinet carry on
**[exercises on situational awareness]{.underline}**, whereby they
**[receive intelligence and military advice and are immersed in an
information space with blue and red teams]{.underline}**. Moreover,
**[every two years, there is a large-scale exercise involving national
governments. These]{.underline}** efforts aim to **[build familiarity
with]{.underline}** the **[technology-related security
challenges]{.underline}**. **[[However,]{.mark} further [evolution of
AI-based cyber attacks]{.mark} can [constitute an increasing threat for
datareliant organizations such as NATO.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[Beyond cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}** defense, **[[the Alliance
started to work on]{.underline}]{.mark}** the broader issue of
**[[Emerging]{.mark} Disruptive [Tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}**
(EDTs) **[[only in 2019]{.underline}]{.mark}**, by setting up an
innovation board co-chaired by the Deputy Secretary General and the
Supreme Allied Commander Transformation. Moreover, a dedicated unit was
created in the Emerging Security Challenge Division. Two **[[White
Papers were produced]{.mark},]{.underline}** respectively **[[on
AI]{.underline}]{.mark}** and on autonomous weapons, **[[to provide
inputs for Allies' decisions in this regard]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
current NATO approach is based on the motto "adopting and adapting",
entailing five complimentary goals: (1) better understand emerging
disruptive technologies; (2) properly look at their implications for
defense; (3) decide about their use; (4) mitigate their risks; and (5)
exploit their advantages.

Noticeably, **[the traditional defense industrial ecosystem entails long
planning, oligopolistic supply and monopsonic demand.]{.underline}**
Over time, it was **[characterized by substantial technology transfers
from the military to the civilian domain]{.underline}** (the so-called
'**[spin offs']{.underline}**), **[including the]{.underline}** very
same embryonic **[Internet]{.underline}**. In recent years, several
**[[new technologies]{.mark} with relevant implications [for security
and defense]{.mark} have been [emerging from]{.mark} a different
ecosystem, marked by bottom-up [innovation]{.mark}, a rapid
development-to-[market]{.mark} cycle, and a technology transfer from the
civilian to the military domain]{.underline}**. As a result, with the
relevant exception of certain space assets and hypersonic technologies,
**[the civilian sector is increasingly developing into the innovation
driver, and defense]{.underline}** one **[has become]{.underline}**
quite **[dependent]{.underline}**. **[Such a shift implies that priority
setting for current and future technology development is
not]{.underline}** substantially **[driven by states]{.underline}**
anymore. **[In the US, the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) struggles to develop a dialogue with the [private
sector]{.mark} gravitating around the Silicon Valley to embrace certain
research lines]{.underline}**. The NATO Industry Partnership on the
cyber domain serves as platform for Alliance's officials and industrial
representatives to exchange notes, yet major ICT players do not seem
very interested in having such a structured dialogue. Moreover,
investments in these technologies require venture capitals and the
acceptance of the risks to fail -- something which usually states, and
particularly Ministries of Defense, cannot afford. The US, the UK,
France, Germany, the Netherlands and other Allies made certain steps to
adapt their defense innovation models in these domains, but this is only
the beginning of a long transformation process.

As a matter of fact, **[[adapting to emerging]{.mark} and disruptive
[tech]{.mark}nologies [is harder for some Allies]{.mark} than
others.]{.underline}** **[[The]{.mark} related [risk is moving towards a
multi-layer Alliance]{.mark}, [with some]{.mark} member [states
holding]{.mark} new [tech]{.mark}nologies, [and others not having such
advantage]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[Ideally, the solution would be to
collectively adopt certain new technologies]{.mark}, but this represents
a challenge for the NATO Defence Planning Process, military procurement,
common funding, etc]{.underline}**. A technology group of experts has
been appointed to reflect upon issues including but not limited to
these, and the Secretary General will probably present a report to the
next summit of Heads of state and governments.

Putting together the five characteristics of hybrid threats (use of
multiple synchronized tools, ability to create ambiguity and to hide
true intentions, deliberate threshold manipulation, exploitation of the
seams of democratic societies, and use of decoys); the SEES model
(situational awareness, explaining, estimating, and strategic notice);
and the new challenges of today's information environment (speed,
volume, AI, and degrading expertise), they result in a mix that can
influence decision-making algorithms and, in Omand's words, "it is our
own demons that are most likely to mislead us" (2020).

Since **[[hybrid threats]{.mark} are designed to [interrupt
effectiveness]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the SEES model at some point,
**[[by]{.mark} trying to create [cognitive errors such as]{.mark} those
arising from [group think]{.mark}ing, 2 [mirror imaging or]{.mark}
applying [unconscious confirmation bias]{.mark}, [they]{.mark} can
[challenge]{.mark} organizations like]{.underline}** the European Union
(EU) and **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** even more than a state. **[[The
multilateral setting]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- **[with several,
connected national interests]{.underline}** -- **[[can be more
vulnerable to hybrid threat activities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
things that can go wrong in the SEES model are especially vulnerable in
a multilateral setting, unless there is a comprehensive approach,
willingness to exchange information, joint understanding on resilience,
and mechanisms to counter and respond in place.

The way Moscow and Beijing think about interference and influence is
different from countries with a democratic system.
**[[For]{.underline}]{.mark}** the EU and **[[NATO]{.mark}, both [Russia
and China are difficult states to deal with]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[China is seen in the EU as a global partner, competitor and systemic
rival]{.underline}**. **[It has not been on NATO's radar before the 2019
London Summit, but the Report "[NATO 2030]{.mark}" delivered by the
Group of Expert appointed by the Alliance's Secretary General
[states]{.mark} that "[NATO must devote]{.mark} much more time,
political [resources]{.mark} and action [to]{.mark} the [security
challenges posed by China]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (2020: 12). **[Russia
has been viewed by the West as a systemic rival for much
longer,]{.underline}** but it has also been considered part of the
European cultural heritage in the EU. **[[For NATO, Russia has]{.mark}
been the greatest military power in the East, which has [conflicts of
interest]{.mark} with NATO.]{.underline}** **[[For the moment, open
military conflict is not viewed as]{.mark} very [likely]{.mark} neither
[for Moscow nor for Beijing, although]{.mark} it is [not
excluded]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[This leaves the door open to hybrid
threats]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, a mechanism that has roots in
authoritarian strategic culture but also has national
specificities]{.underline}**. The things that can go wrong in the SEES
model are challenged by the new information environment being
manipulated according to the tactics of hybrid threats. Even if the EU
is not a military alliance, while NATO is, both organizations are
challenged in similar ways by hybrid threats. **[Given]{.underline}**
several factors, including **[overlapping membership]{.underline}**, it
is clear that **[weakening one will also weaken the
other]{.underline}**. **[Therefore, in the landscape of hybrid threats,
the EU and NATO are considered as a united target by hostile actors --
and they can also best counter and respond to these threats if working
together]{.underline}**.

**[Against this backdrop, here follow some recommendations aimed to
policy-makers and expert communities [in]{.mark}]{.underline}** both
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** and EU countries: • **[[The importance
of analysis is growing]{.mark}. [Too much effort has been]{.mark} put
into [collecting data, and not enough]{.mark} into [training]{.mark}
analysts. Older analysts need to be trained about the new information
environment and its functioning. In turn, the younger generation needs
to be trained on history, context and connections.]{.underline}**
**[Central elements in training are understanding the psychology of the
adversary, the assessments of motivations, and
rationales]{.underline}**.

The cultural context of information is lost in the volume of
information. **[[International cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
especially **[[on the part of]{.mark} an alliance like [NATO, needs to
be lifted]{.mark} to a new level.]{.underline}** This does **[not
only]{.underline}** concern **[joint situational awareness about hostile
actors, but also]{.underline}** involves **[[understanding partners and
their perspectives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Without that]{.mark}
mutual understanding among allies and partners, [divergences can
become]{.mark} over [politicized and decision-making]{.mark} paralyzed,
which is what the actors behind hybrid threats want.]{.underline}**

**[[There is a need for more]{.mark} effective [training]{.mark} in the
use of open-source intelligence,]{.underline}** focusing on the sources
and tools for finding information, including the biases they may have.
In addition, **[more knowledge is needed to be able to detect linkages
between actions]{.underline}**. **[Hybrid threat activities start in a
settled way, often on a very legal basis, and the potential for such
activities to turn into hostile acts needs to be
recognized]{.underline}**.

Military communities should reach out more often to non-military expert
communities**. [[To counter hybrid threats]{.mark}, a multidisciplinary
[approach needs to]{.mark} be taken, which really means
[combin]{.mark}ing different disciplinary fields and expertise coming
from [practitioners, academics and the private
sector]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[Sharing the vocabulary is important when building situational
awareness. [Civil-military cooperation]{.mark} is [needed]{.mark} here.
The civilian side uses different words than the military and sometimes,
even if the understanding of a concept would be shared, actors do not
understand due to the use of different terms, and discussions can turn
into an unnecessary battle of words.]{.underline}**

Recently, analysts have argued that emerging technologies with military
applications may undermine nuclear stability (see here, here, and here),
but the logic of these arguments is debatable and overlooks a more
straightforward reason why **[[new tech]{.mark}nology [might cause
nuclear conflict: by upending the existing balance of power]{.mark}
among nuclear-armed states]{.underline}**. **[[This]{.mark} latter
concern [is]{.mark} more [probable]{.mark} and [dangerous and demands an
immediate policy response]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[For more than 70 years, the world has avoided major power conflict,
and many attribute this era of peace to nuclear weapons.
In]{.underline}** situations of mutually assured destruction (**[MAD),
neither side has an incentive to start a conflict because doing so will
only result in its own annihilation]{.underline}**. **[[The key
to]{.mark} this model of [deterrence is]{.mark} the maintenance of
secure [second-strike capabilities---]{.mark}the ability to absorb an
enemy nuclear attack and respond with a devastating
counterattack]{.underline}**.

Recently analysts have begun to worry, however, that **[[new strategic
military tech]{.mark}nologies [may make it possible]{.mark} for a state
[to]{.mark} conduct a successful [first strike]{.mark} on an
enemy]{.underline}**. For example, Chinese colleagues have complained to
me in Track II dialogues that the United States may decide to launch a
sophisticated cyberattack against Chinese nuclear command and control,
essentially turning off China's nuclear forces. Then, Washington will
follow up with a massive strike with conventional cruise and hypersonic
missiles to destroy China's nuclear weapons. Finally, if any Chinese
forces happen to survive, the United States can simply mop up China's
ragged retaliatory strike with advanced missile defenses. China will be
disarmed and US nuclear weapons will still be sitting on the shelf,
untouched.

If the United States, or any other state acquires such a first-strike
capability, then the logic of MAD would be undermined. Washington may be
tempted to launch a nuclear first strike. Or China may choose instead to
use its nuclear weapons early in a conflict before they can be wiped
out---the so-called "use 'em or lose 'em" problem.

According to this logic, therefore, the appropriate policy response
would be to ban outright or control any new weapon systems that might
threaten second-strike capabilities.

This way of thinking about new technology and stability, however, is
open to question. Would any US president truly decide to launch a
massive, bolt-out-of-the-blue nuclear attack because he or she thought
s/he could get away with it? And why does it make sense for the country
in the inferior position, in this case China, to intentionally start a
nuclear war that it will almost certainly lose? More important, this
conceptualization of how new technology affects stability is too narrow,
focused exclusively on how new military technologies might be used
against nuclear forces directly.

Rather, **[[we should think more broadly about how]{.mark} new
[technology]{.mark} might [affect global
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and, for this, it is helpful to turn to
scholarly international relations theory. **[[The dominant]{.mark}
theory of the [cause]{.mark}s [of war]{.mark} in the academy [is the
"bargaining model]{.mark} of war]{.underline}**." **[[This]{.mark}
theory [identifies rapid shifts in the balance of power as a primary
cause of conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[International politics often presents states with conflicts that they
can settle through peaceful bargaining, but [when bargaining
breaks]{.mark} down, [war results]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[Shifts in
the balance of power]{.mark} are problematic because they [undermine
effective bargaining]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[After all, [why
agree]{.mark} to a deal [today if your]{.mark} bargaining position will
be [stronger tomorrow]{.mark}]{.underline}**? And, a clear understanding
of the **[[military balance of power can contribute to
peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**. (Why start a war you are likely to lose?)
But **[[shifts in]{.mark} the balance of [power muddy understandings of
which states have the advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

You may see where this is going[. **[New technologies
threaten]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to create potentially [destabilizing
shifts]{.mark} in the balance of power]{.underline}**.

For decades, **[[stability in Europe and Asia has been supported by US
military power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[In recent years, however, the
balance of power in Asia has begun to shift, [as China]{.mark} has
[increased]{.mark} its military [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[Already, [Beijing has become more assertive]{.mark} in the region,
claiming contested territory in the South China Sea. And the results of
[Russia's military modernization have been on full display in]{.mark}
its ongoing intervention in [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[Moreover, [China may have the lead over the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [in]{.mark} emerging technologies that could be decisive
for the future of military acquisitions and warfare,
including]{.underline}** 3D printing, hypersonic missiles, quantum
computing, 5G wireless connectivity, and **[artificial
intelligence]{.underline}** (**[[AI]{.mark}).]{.underline}** And Russian
President Vladimir **[[Putin is]{.underline}]{.mark}** building new
unmanned vehicles while ominously **[[declaring, "Whoever leads in AI
will rule the world]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

**[[If China or Russia]{.mark} are able to [incorporate]{.mark} new
[tech]{.mark}nologies [into their militaries before the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, then [this could lead to the]{.mark}
kind of [rapid shift in]{.mark} the [balance]{.mark} of power
[that]{.mark} often [causes war]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[If Beijing believes]{.mark} emerging [tech]{.mark}nologies
[provide]{.mark} it with a newfound, local military [advantage]{.mark}
over the United States, for example, [it may]{.mark} be more willing
than previously to [initiate conflict]{.mark} over
Taiwan.]{.underline}** **[And [if Putin]{.mark} thinks new [tech]{.mark}
has [strengthened his hand, he may]{.mark} be more tempted to
[launch]{.mark} a Ukraine-style [invasion of a NATO
member]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[Either]{.mark} scenario could bring these nuclear powers into direct
conflict with the United States, and once nuclear armed states are at
war, there is an inherent [risk]{.mark} of [nuclear conflict]{.mark}
through limited nuclear war strategies, nuclear brinkmanship, or simple
accident or inadvertent escalation]{.underline}**.

This framing of the problem leads to a different set of policy
implications. The concern is not simply technologies that threaten to
undermine nuclear second-strike capabilities directly, but, rather, any
technologies that can result in a meaningful shift in the broader
balance of power. And **[[the solution is]{.underline}]{.mark}** not to
preserve second-strike capabilities, but **[[to preserve prevailing
power balances]{.mark} more broadly.]{.underline}**

When it comes to new technology, **[[this means]{.mark} that the [United
States should seek to maintain an innovation
edge]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Washington should also work with other
states, including its nuclear-armed rivals, to develop a new set of arms
control and nonproliferation agreements and export controls to deny
these newer and potentially destabilizing technologies to potentially
hostile states.

These are no easy tasks, but **[[the consequences of]{.mark} Washington
[losing]{.mark} the race for [tech]{.mark}nological [superiority]{.mark}
to its autocratic challengers just [might mean nuclear
Armageddon]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

//pipk

A glance at the history of artificial intelligence
(**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**) shows that the field **[periodically
[goes through phases of development racing]{.mark} ahead [and
slowing]{.mark} down]{.underline}** -- **[often dubbed "AI springs" and
"AI winters]{.underline}**". **[[The world is]{.mark} currently several
years [in]{.mark}to [an AI spring, dominated by important
advances]{.mark} in machinelearning technologies.]{.underline}** In
Europe, policymakers' efforts to grapple with the rapid pace of
technological development have gone through several phases over the last
five to ten years. **[The first phase was [marked by uncertainty]{.mark}
among policymakers over what to make of the rapid and seemingly
groundbreaking developments in AI]{.underline}**. **[This]{.underline}**
phase **[lasted until]{.underline}** around **[2018]{.underline}** --
**[though, in some European states, and on some issues, uncertainty
remains]{.underline}**. **[The second phase consisted of efforts to
frame and AI challenges politically, and to address them, on a domestic
level: between 2018 and 2020]{.underline}**, no fewer than **[[21 EU
member states]{.mark} published national AI strategies designed to
delineate their views and aims, and, in some cases, to [outline
investment plans]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[The next phase could be a period of
international]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and specifically
**[transatlantic[, cooperation on AI]{.mark}. [After]{.mark} several
[years of European states working at full capacity]{.mark} to understand
how to support [domestic AI research]{.mark}, including by assembling
expert teams to deliberate new laws and regulations]{.underline}**,
**[[there is growing interest]{.mark} among policymakers and experts in
looking beyond Europe.]{.underline}** **[On the EU level, AI policy and
governance have already received significant attention,]{.underline}**
with the European Commission playing an important role in incentivising
member states to develop AI strategies, such as by starting to tackle
issues around how to make sure AI is "ethical" and "trustworthy". But
**[recent months have seen a [rise in]{.mark} the number of [calls for
international cooperation on AI driven by liberal democracies across the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Western countries and their [allies
have]{.mark} set up [new forums for cooperation]{.mark} on how to take
AI forward, and are activating existing forums. More such organisations
and platforms for cooperation are planned.]{.underline}**

**[[Calls for cooperation between the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and Europe have become particularly]{.mark} regular and
[resonant]{.mark}]{.underline}**: following last year's US presidential
election, it was reported that the European Commission planned to
propose **[a "[Transatlantic Trade]{.mark} and Technology
[C]{.mark}ouncil]{.underline}**", **[which [would set joint standards on
new tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}**. **[And, in September 2020, [the
US set up a group]{.mark} of like-minded countries "[to provide
values-based global leadership in]{.mark} defense for policies and
approaches in adopting [AI]{.mark}", which included seven European
states, in addition to countries such as Australia, Canada, and South
Korea. In June 2020, [the Global Partnership]{.mark} on Artificial
Intelligence [was founded to consider]{.mark} the [responsible
development]{.mark} of AI; it counts among its members the US, four
European states, and the European Union]{.underline}**.

**[This paper examines the reasons]{.underline}** **[[European
states]{.underline}]{.mark}** may **[[want to work with the US on
AI,]{.mark} and]{.underline}** **[why [the US may want to reach out to
Europe on the issue]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It also identifies the
points of disagreement that may stop the allies from fully fleshing out
transatlantic AI cooperation. The paper shows that, **[[while both sides
are interested]{.mark} in working together, their [rationales]{.mark}
for doing so [differ]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Furthermore, **[[economic
and political factors may stand in the way]{.mark} of cooperation, [even
though such cooperation could have a positive impact on the way AI
develops]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The paper also argues that
**[[transatlantic cooperation in]{.mark} the area of [military AI could
be a good first step]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- **[here, [Europe and the
US should build on existing collaboration within
NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The paper concludes with a brief discussion
of the different forums that have been created or proposed for
transatlantic and broader Western cooperation on AI.

**[This question [is]{.mark} both [important and

**[[America's]{.mark} broad network of [alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and security partnerships **[[is a singular asset in defending liberal

surveillance]{.mark} technologies to countries across the
globe]{.underline}**.1 By one estimate, **[more than 100 countries
purchase surveillance and censorship gear from China and Russia, receive
training on these technologies, or simply imitate methods of
surveillance and censorship that are designed to control public opinion
and stifle dissent]{.underline}**.2

**[As the digital and physical environments become intertwined,

**[debate persists over the threat of digital authoritarianism and how
to counter it.]{.underline}** **[While U.S. allies will likely vary in
their strategic orientations toward China and Russia, [there is]{.mark}
a [growing consensus on the need to showcase a democratic way of
AI]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[[These]{.mark} debates [will take
shape in a world of globalized markets for AI talent and integrated

U.S. approach would leverage]{.mark} its network of [allies]{.mark} and

on advances in AI and machine learning to **[[foster sustainable]{.mark}

\"Existential Gap: Digital/AI Acceleration and the Missing Global
Governance Capacity\" February 14.
<https://www.cigionline.org/articles/existential-gap-digitalai-acceleration-and-the-missing-global-governance-capacity/>
//pipk

**[We are facing [a]{.mark}n ever-[growing gap between]{.mark} the
phenomenal acceleration of [technology and]{.mark} of
[connectivity]{.mark}, and the human capacity to manage these
trends]{.underline}**. The gap is well-documented in the fields of
finance, climate change, pandemics and nuclear risks. But **[the
contrast between the [exponential growth of]{.mark} disruptive
[tech]{.mark}nology [and]{.mark} the lacklustre supply of
[governance]{.mark} mechanisms is [starkest in]{.mark} the fields of
digital governance and artificial intelligence
([AI]{.mark}).]{.underline}**

**[That gap [becomes existential]{.mark} when we consider the likely
future development of]{.underline}** artificial general intelligence
(**[[AGI]{.underline}]{.mark}**) (Ord 2020) or superintelligence
(Bostrom 2015) **[that [can be misaligned with]{.mark} human values or
even the goal of ensuring the continuity of [human
existence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[This question of [the governance
of]{.mark} life with [AI may be the most essential question of our
time]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Tegmark 2017), but you would not know it
from the current output of global governance in this field. Summarizing
the judgement of many scientists in the field, Toby Ord argues that
**[unaligned AGI is actually [the number-one global existential risk for
humanity, with a 10 percent chance of human extinction within 100
years]{.mark}. The prophesized [existential threats]{.mark} posed by
extreme and accelerated technological advancement and expansion [have
never been as close to reality as they are
now]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} As noted by Yuval Noah Harari and
Daniel Kahneman (2021) in a recent conversation, **[the task of taming
and [governing]{.mark} the digital/[AI]{.mark} revolution is [daunting.
Humanity may have no slack]{.mark} for a mistake this time around,
[given]{.mark} the [existential consequences]{.mark} of such a
mistake.]{.underline}**

**[Today, [we]{.mark} already [benefit from]{.mark} tremendous digital
or [AI innovations in e-commerce]{.mark}, social media and
[communication, home management, work]{.mark}, health care, education,
[transportation, and entertainment]{.mark} (West and Allen
2020).]{.underline}** We can foresee that AI-driven algorithms may soon
be able to correct human judgement flaws (or noise) caused by fatigue,
irregularity, emotions and other weaknesses, afflictions that can
generate variation in decisions by up to 50 percent (Kahneman, Sibony
and Sunstein 2021). **[[Within two decades, we]{.mark} can [envisage a
world with]{.mark} generalized [deep learning]{.mark} and [virtual
reality]{.mark}, computer vision, contactless love, fully [autonomous
vehicles in]{.mark} most advanced and [emerging economies]{.mark},
[autonomous weapons]{.mark} in militaries [and]{.mark} a [dream of
plenitude]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Lee and Chen 2021).

**[Yet, [today]{.mark}, we [witness]{.mark} tremendous havoc created by
the explosion of [social anger, exacerbated by]{.mark} sophisticated
[social media algorithms]{.mark}, deep polarization, the return of
tribal politics, the [loss of agreed truths and]{.mark} the [spread of
misinformation]{.mark} and dangerous conspiracies, the loss of privacy,
the rise of massive and uber-powerful tech companies, and massive job
displacement and inequality]{.underline}** (Bartlett 2018). **[Influence
operations by foreign [states]{.mark} have also [amplified]{.mark} such
social anger and [polarization]{.mark} in many democracies, adding a
degree of external threat and urgency. We also live with a world of
security-driven digital decoupling between the United States and
China]{.underline}** (Ma 2021). In other words, **[[the digital
revolution is moving faster than]{.mark} the human [capacity to]{.mark}
cope with it, embed it within a public good-oriented framework and
[steer]{.mark} its disruptive power [toward a non-destructive
direction]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[The problem is]{.underline}** visible at the national level but
**[particularly salient at the global level]{.underline}**.
**[Digital/[data governance is fragmenting]{.mark} among]{.underline}**
at least four poles: **[a [US model with maximum innovation]{.mark} and
limited regulation; an [EU]{.mark} model]{.underline}** with a strong
regulatory balance; **[an [India]{.mark} model]{.underline}** with an
emphasis on digital sovereignty and infant industry protection
(applicable to other developing countries); **[[and]{.mark} a [Chinese
model]{.mark}]{.underline}** with both rapid innovation, strong state
control and surveillance. **[Our [global governance capacity is affected
by multiple splits]{.mark}]{.underline}**: a US-EU split over privacy,
tax and anti-monopoly regulations; an India-West split over data
ownership and first-mover advantage; and, worst of all, a potential
digital cold war between the United States (and its allies) and China.
In response to this dire need for governance, Rohinton P. Medhora and
Taylor Owen (2020) have proposed a need for a new fundamental effort at
coordinated governance --- or a "digital Bretton Woods." While
fundamental international conditions and global distribution of power
today differ drastically from the Bretton Woods era, a high-stake and
fragmented digital world is in dire need of such renewed cooperative
spirit.

Recognizing the gap in digital governance, we ask the following
questions: What is the scale of the gap in governance relative to
requirements needed to keep the digital economy afloat? And what could
be a pathway forward in the context of the growing securitization and
increasing divides?

**[[It is urgent to]{.mark} raise a sense of awareness,
[mobilize]{.mark} all social and public [actors]{.mark} around this
urgent dilemma and [catalyze a multi-level effort to address this
conundrum]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We argue that no global, regional or
national institution alone will be able to deliver the right governance
capacity. Instead, we recommend a highly reactive, innovative and
competitive model of networked governance that operates at multiple
levels with key nodes and catalysts.

**[[Governance innovation must keep pace]{.mark} with [technological
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Given how far the digital cold war
has already proceeded and the currently low capacity to cooperate
between the United States and China, part of [the solution will need to
involve]{.mark} clubs and [alliances]{.mark} of countries and non-state
actors]{.underline}**. At the same time, some level of global
coordination and basic rules for global co-existence are crucial for
success in managing this existential threat. The Group of Twenty (G20)
is one critical venue for such work, even though it has not delivered so
far.

**[Key Indicators on the [Exponential Rise of the Digital
Economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Over the last few years, and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic
period, the **[digital economy has experienced an exponential rise and
begun to [transform human interactions, production and
trade]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Suominen 2019). In Table 1, we offer a
review of selected indicators on cross-border data flows and
digitalization. It is clear that digital trade and cross-border data
flows, along with other digital innovations, are rising faster than
physical trade flows.

Economy

Table 1 shows that key components of the digital economy, including
e-commerce, AI economy and cross-border mobile payments, have
experienced steady growth since 2017, and are projected to continue
growing. 2020 saw the sharpest growth in several components, likely due
to mobility constraints and increased reliance on digital tools
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. While current data illustrates
useful trends, it is important to note that the volume of digital trade
--- a key component of data on the digital economy --- is very hard to
measure.1 This is in part due to the lack of a shared definition of what
constitutes digital trade, highlighting a need for technocratic
standardization as a basis for high-level digital governance.

Why Addressing the Digital Governance Gap Matters

We offer here a typology of risks involved in the digital governance
gap:

Under-institutionalized markets (North 1990; Williamson 1985): **[All
markets require basic rules and governance to ensure trust,
accountability and resilience, and to prevent abuse by potential
oligopolistic players]{.underline}**. Global markets require global
institutions. **[Digital governance is a new domain, where
[innovators]{.mark} and disruptors have been able to [run ahead of rule
making]{.mark}. We are emerging from more than two decades of an
under-institutionalized digital economy, in which many large imbalances
and market deficiencies are appearing in every society around the
world]{.underline}**.

**[Unprecedented power of digital companies]{.underline}**: The current
moment may be the first time in human history that a private company
such as Facebook (Meta) has the ability on its own to screen messages of
leaders and politicians from every country in the world, except China,
North Korea, Cuba, and maybe Iran. And this global function is only
peripheral to Facebook's core business, with just hundreds of assigned
staff. In other words, Facebook, along with Twitter and a couple more
giant for-profit digital companies, has acquired in less than 15 years
the power to control information, emotions, narratives and
political/social mobilization in the majority of countries of the world,
including the United States. And they are generating disproportionate
profits from this dominant position. All this **[is taking place in a
near complete vacuum of digital governance.]{.underline}** Most
countries outside the United States and China have limited power to
regulate and control these US-based and China-based global digital
companies. The US government retains residual power to do so, but has
been unable to act due to constitutional constraints and great
polarization in Congress. China (behind its internet firewall) has
already started wrestling with this power and cracking down on its own
giants. India has started to pass restricting measures on the power and
freedom of social media companies on its territory. The European Union
is taking its own regulatory path through the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) and its successor currently under negotiations, as
well as tough competition rules, within the constraints of its relative
weak position in the space (no EU-based digital giants). But the
governance gap remains enormous in the United States and many other
countries, as well as at the global level.

**[Risk of [explosive]{.mark} social [disruptions]{.mark} and
inequality]{.underline}**: The scale of disruption **[[induced
by]{.underline}]{.mark}** digital and **[[AI
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** under current intellectual property
protection and lack of redistribution accrues immense winner-take-all
benefits to first movers. We are witnessing **[at the same time a
historic concentration of capital and wealth and growing numbers of
displaced or laid-off workers in declining industries]{.underline}**. We
can soon expect to have digital entrepreneurs with a net worth of US\$1
trillion (from a quarter of a trillion so far with Elon Musk and Jeff
Bezos), alongside massive job displacement. **[Such fast-paced social
dislocation and inequality could prove politically explosive and very
hard to manage]{.underline}** (Lee 2018). **[No social system is ready
--- and the global governance is not ready either. [The viability of
modern states is]{.mark} also [at stake]{.mark},]{.underline}** as their
revenue base keeps eroding. In the late nineteenth century, when the oil
and railroad revolutions generated a similar concentration of wealth, it
took all the power and energy of a Teddy Roosevelt to tame these forces.
We don't have such capacity today.

**[Global systemic risks]{.underline}**: **[The global digital economy
is extraordinarily interconnected and fast-paced]{.underline}**. It
encompasses data flows, e-commerce, mobile payments, digital currency
(with increasing future prevalence), AI algorithms, fully automated cars
and weapons. **[[Is the current system resilient against]{.mark}
contagion effects or [collapse]{.mark}? What is the safety net in case
of a crisis]{.underline}**?

**[[Loss of privacy]{.mark} and potential loss of human
freedom]{.underline}**: **[The rise of the surveillance state [is an
extreme reality]{.mark} in China]{.underline}**, including in repression
operations. **[But]{.underline}** it is **[also]{.underline}** a reality
**[[all over the world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Companies such as Google
and Facebook not only have more data about each individual than they can
imagine, but also the capacity to couple this data with future AI
algorithms for all kinds of usage. For the first time in human history,
most humans have handed over fundamentally private information to either
giant private actors, states or both. Even worse, regulatory breaches
(cf. Cambridge Analytica) give political or criminal actors access to
important and strategic data, with which they can manipulate human
psychology.

**[Democratic existential crisis]{.underline}**: **[The explosion and
equalization of information, and the intensification of complexity, have
eroded any sense of agreed truth and reality within most nations. Social
media has unexpectedly accelerated polarization, amplified echo chambers
and closed loops among like-minded individuals, greatly contributing to
extreme polarization in many societies across the planet]{.underline}**.
**[Absurd conspiracies]{.underline}** can **[spread virally and inspire
violent actions by large spontaneous groups]{.underline}**, as shown by
the January 6 insurrection in the United States (with a large number of
people mobilized by QAnon beliefs). At a deeper level, **[new
understandings about the concept of extended mind in psychology show
that [humans are]{.mark} increasingly [delegating]{.mark} part of their
[thinking]{.mark} processes [to]{.mark} smart phones and their
[algorithm]{.mark}-driven suggestions devised to serve profit-seeking
companies]{.underline}** (cf. work by Peter Reiner).2 **[Human behaviour
may be profoundly changing in ways never seen before, which our
democratic institutions are not ready for]{.underline}**. Facebook's
move to a **[metaverse world]{.underline}** that can attract humans to
spend time and to be transformed **[in a totally unregulated environment
has the potential to further increase this risk.]{.underline}**

**[External cyberthreats to democracy]{.underline}**: **[[The]{.mark}
current [digitalized world is]{.mark} also increasingly [used as a tool
to undermine democracy from the outside]{.mark}. Russia's
interference]{.underline}** in the 2016 American presidential election
through social media campaigns highlights the extent to which an
unregulated digital sphere could undermine democratic institutions.
**[China's propaganda efforts]{.underline}** on platforms such as
Twitter and YouTube during the 2020 Taiwanese presidential election are
yet another example that an unregulated cyberspace could warrant
injudicious digital campaigns. More recently, the sale of **[Israeli
spyware]{.underline}** Pegasus to various governments --- who in turn
used it for malicious efforts against other states, and individuals such
as journalists, reporters and human rights activists.

**[Rise of [cybercrimes]{.mark}, cyberpiracy and
cyberattacks]{.underline}** (Deibert 2013, 2020; Sanger 2018). The open
structure of the internet has left great space **[for hackers and
organized gangs]{.underline}**. Worse, **[the existence of an illegal
black market [incentivize]{.mark}s smart young digital talents in many
places around the world to look for [zero-day loopholes]{.mark} in
operating systems and sell those to the highest bidders, including the
national security agencies of many countries]{.underline}** (Perlroth
2020). **[[This]{.mark} quickly [escalates into]{.mark} a growing
cyberspying competition and even [cyberwar]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Segal
2016).

**[Fragmentation of the internet and of the digital economy into rival
spheres (splinternet), and weaponization of
interdependence]{.underline}** (Drezner, Farrell and Newman 2021;
Farrell and Newman 2019; Ma 2021; Suominen 2019). **[The raising of
stakes in the digital economy, the sudden acceleration of the digital
transformation in China, the intensification of security competition and
the high prevalence of [dual-use tech]{.mark}nologies [in]{.mark} the
digital/[AI]{.mark} space have led to an [increas]{.mark}ing [potential
for]{.mark} a digital cold war, as well as other [fractures
among]{.mark} various [regional poles]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Winston
Ma (2021, 42) writes: "all in all, **[U.S.-China tech decoupling is real
and accelerating.]{.underline}** Hence, **[the digital economy is in a
vital conflict and crisis]{.underline}**: the global tech world,
together with at least part of the world economy, is now fractured into
two-and potential more...spheres of influence, whereas tech
entrepreneurs are driving the prospect of a technological singularity,
hyper-connected society, and internet of everything." **[This decoupling
is extremely risky, because it is abrupt, driven by fears and not
negotiated. It leads to highly explosive tit-for-tat measures that are
hard to contain. This process massively interferes with the human effort
to generate a global governance framework]{.underline}**.

Measuring the Digital Global Governance Gap

In Table 2 (and, in greater detail, in Annex 1), we offer a summary of
existing digital governance at the global, regional, club or national
levels. Overall, we evaluate that the governance of basic internet
functions remains surprisingly resilient (8/10), but other dimensions of
digital and AI governance are extremely weak (2/10 in most cases).

One powerful indicator that highlights the gap between the risks
outlined above and the current state of global governance is found in
the recent G20 Rome Leaders' Declaration. The focus remains on sharing
the gains of digital innovation for the green economy, education and
economic growth. However, the digital economy gets only brief mentions
toward the latter part of the declaration with generic and toothless
statements such as the following:

"In cooperation with social partners, we will adopt human-centered
policy approaches to promote social dialogue and to ensure greater
social justice; safe and healthy working conditions; and decent work for
all, including within global supply chains. To reduce inequalities,
eradicate poverty, support worker transitions and reintegration in
labour markets and promote inclusive and sustainable growth, we will
strengthen our social protection systems" (G20 Leaders 2021, para. 35).

"We recognize the role of technology and innovation as key enablers for
the global recovery and sustainable development....With this in mind, we
will work to strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation to secure
our ICT, address shared vulnerabilities and threats, and combat
cybercrime" (ibid., para 46).

"Well aware of the benefits stemming from the responsible use and
development of trustworthy human-centered Artificial Intelligence (AI),
we will advance the implementation of the G20 AI Principles" (ibid.,
para 47).

"We will also continue to further common understanding and to work
towards identifying commonalities, complementarities and elements of
convergence between existing regulatory approaches and instruments
enabling data to flow with trust, in order to foster future
interoperability. Recognizing the responsibility of digital service
providers, we will work in 2022 towards enhancing confidence in the
digital environment by improving internet safety and countering online
abuse, hate speech, online violence and terrorism while protecting human
rights and fundamental freedoms" (ibid., para. 48).

This summary of current global digital governance reveals the extent of
the gap with what is at stake!

From Table 2, we can draw several important lessons. First, the
well-established nature of internet governance shows that
**[[governance]{.mark} in the digital domain [is]{.mark} indeed
[possible]{.mark}. Internet governance was established several decades
ago and is operated by largely independent and apolitical
entities.]{.underline}** However, times have changed. **[It is important
to recognize the current geopolitical stakes and inherent international
context that now constitutes multi-polarities of
interest]{.underline}**. Second, despite the absence of a centralized
governance mechanism for digital trade, **[the language and framing of
rules on digital trade as expressed in recent free-trade and digital
partnership agreements are increasingly similar, and indicate some
degree of convergence in the governance of digital trade]{.underline}**.
Finally, the domain that fairs most poorly in terms of governance is
also the domain that is most politicized. The primary motivation behind
limited alignment on accepted 5G or semiconductor providers is driven by
the US geopolitical push against Chinese 5G giant Huawei and
semiconductor giant SMIC, risking bifurcation in global standards and
encouraging autarkic behaviours such as the EU idea of "chips
self-sufficiency."

As a reference, Table 3 offers a comparative summary of different
approaches used by the United States, European Union, China and India.

Conclusion and Global Digital Governance Proposals

**[[There is a]{.mark} huge [disconnect between]{.mark} the [speed of
tech]{.mark}nological development, the scale of [existential
risks]{.mark} involved, [and]{.mark} the acceleration of [securitization
on the one hand and the supply of]{.mark} national/[global governance
and increase in human capacity on the other
hand]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**[Political leaders are not yet incentivized to deal with this
existential set of issues. They are distracted by short-term political
urgencies and the acceleration of tit-for-tat rivalry.]{.underline}**

**[A digital Bretton Woods captures the spirit of global digital
governance we should strive for.]{.underline}** However, it is essential
to recognize the radically different context of today compared to 1944.
**[The lack of "global yearning for peace and stability"]{.underline}**
highlighted by Medhora and Owen (2020), **[is]{.underline}** further
**[aggravated by a new environment of multi-polarity and diffused
interests]{.underline}**. **[Thus, [we may only be able to reach a thin
global framework under current]{.mark} geopolitical [conditions]{.mark},
and it can only be [part of a]{.mark} larger multi-level and partly
[competitive effort to generate governance
capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**[The human solutions to the predicament cannot come from a single
locus or look like responses to past governance issues]{.underline}**.
**[There will need to be multiple entry points with a networking and
competitive dynamic among them]{.underline}** --- some from the G20,
World Trade Organization (WTO), United Nations, some from club
governance (Group of Seven \[G7\], Quad, China-based solutions, along
with bilateral forums such as the US-EU dialogue), and some from private
actors, civil society networks, think tanks and academic actors.

**[[For]{.mark} any [critical]{.mark} mass process of [capacity
development to occur]{.mark} in such a way, both [catalyzing focal
points and elements of coordination will be required]{.mark}. [The
global level may]{.mark} yet [play a key signalling role or allow
minimum convergence on dimensions of common
interest]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The G20 urgently needs an upgraded
high-level working group on all digital governance questions.

#### AI innovation in the capitalist economy is driven by capitalist ideals of the winner takes all - this makes inequality, poverty, unemployment and every other instance of violence and exploitation exponentially worse - turns case and ensures that the use of AI is always ineffective and for the wrong goals

#### 1 - AI innovation is integral to capitalism-uses capitalist economics and increases worker exploitation

**Markov** **19**

\[Kieran Markov, The dangers of artificial intelligence under
capitalism, Fightback, 7-31-2019,
https://www.marxist.ca/article/the-dangers-of-artificial-intelligence-under-capitalism,
//1LEE\]

Indeed**[, [AI is playing an integral part]{.mark}]{.underline}** (along
with other important technologies such as quantum computing) in ushering
forward a new technological stage in human history, what scientists and
economists call the "**[[fourth industrial
revolution]{.underline}]{.mark}**". Global consulting firm McKinsey &
Company recently released a report detailing that, while the
introduction of steam engines offered a 0.3 per cent increase to annual
GDP growth between 1850 and 1910, they expect AI to raise annual GDP
growth by 0.8-1.4 per cent by 2065. Another massive consulting firm,
Accenture, anticipates that AI will offer a \$14-trillion boost to
global GDP by 2035.

However, these **[bourgeois predictions should be taken with a large
grain of salt]{.underline}**. **[[Under capitalism, the development of
the means of production is always accompanied by job
losses]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and **[AI is no exception]{.underline}**.
Kai-Fu Lee, who is certainly no Marxist (but much more sober-minded than
Elon Musk!) predicts,

As deep learning washes over the global economy, it will indeed wipe out
billions of jobs up and down the economic ladder: accountants, assembly
line workers, warehouse operators, stock analysts, quality control
inspectors, truckers, paralegals, and even radiologists, just to name a
few. ... Rising in tandem with unemployment will be astronomical wealth
in the hands of the new AI tycoons \[e.g., Google, Facebook, etc\]. ...
\[We\] will begin to see greater and greater concentration of these
astronomical sums in the hands of a few, all while unemployment lines
grow longer.

\[...\]

**[[The AI world order will combine winner-take-all
economics]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[i.e., capitalism!\] **[[with an
unprecedented concentration of wealth]{.mark} in the hands of a few
companies in China and the United States.]{.underline}** This, \[Lee
believes\], is the real underlying threat posed by artificial
intelligence: tremendous social disorder and political collapse stemming
from widespread unemployment and gaping inequality.

AI Superpowers, 2018, pp. 53-58

In other words, under capitalism, **[[AI means the rich get richer while
the workers enjoy increased exploitation, unemployment, and social
cri]{.mark}sis]{.underline}**. As well, contrary to what many predict,
**[wide-scale introduction of AI will not lead to unheard of levels of
growth]{.underline}**. In an epoch of capitalist crisis like the one we
live in today, the capitalists are incapable of using the amazing
technological advances to deliver economic growth. The fact is that
there are already historically low rates of what is known as "capacity
utilization," which means that the capitalists are already unable to use
the productive capacity at their disposal.

This is because **[world capitalism is saddled with a crisis of over
production.]{.underline}** The introduction of AI would only exacerbate
this by making millions of jobs obsolete thus **[reducing the consumer
market]{.underline}**. This is the fundamental barrier to growth today.
If the capitalists cannot sell their products, they will not invest and
the economy will enter crisis. **[[Only under a democratically planned
socialist economy could we harness the amazing potential of AI for the
benefit of all.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Impacts of AI today

We don't need to wait for the future to see how AI will impact us---it
is already playing a disruptive role in the lives of workers. We
experience **[unprecedented levels of privacy violation]{.underline}**:
from systematic surveillance via cameras with precise facial recognition
technology, to **[implicit bias and racism in algorithms]{.underline}**
used for purposes such as credit assessments and the criminal justice
system. Indeed, an algorithm may assign a longer prison sentence to a
black person because the data suggests "they are more likely to
reoffend." In addition, every person who uses social media is well aware
that everything they do is **[invasively tracked by advertising
companies]{.underline}** to a creepy degree; this is because all of your
data (your likes, dislikes, buying history, etc) is held and monopolized
by private companies like Google and Facebook.

**[AI also motivates large-scale exploitation in new
forms.]{.underline}** Recalling that these AI algorithms require huge
amounts of human-labelled data to work well, it's not surprising that
the extremely mind-numbing work of so-called "data farming" has become a
new, prominent source of income for private companies. AI startups in
Finland have adopted the creative business strategy of hiring prison
labourers to do their data farming. Meanwhile, Amazon has created
"Amazon Mechanical Turk" as a platform for extreme exploitation of
humans to do data farming for companies and universities, where the
workers make a median wage of \$2/hour from the safety of their home
computer. In China, "data factories" are becoming ubiquitous, and their
workers make between 10-20 yuan (\$1.47-2.94) per hour.

The object of the military and intelligence agencies' **[[use of
artificial intelligence is the holy grail of every totalitarian
regime]{.underline}]{.mark}**: what the National Security Agency called
"total information awareness," or, as its unofficial mission statement
put it, "Collect It All, Know It All... Exploit It All."

This mission statement, which in another context would seem to be an
unhinged dictator's megalomaniacal fantasy, is fast becoming an imminent
reality through the power of artificial intelligence.

In his statement to the World Socialist Web Site\'s January 16 online
webinar, \"Organizing Resistance to Internet Censorship,\" **[Wikileaks
founder Julian Assange warned of the immense dangers posed to humanity
by the misuse of artificial intelligence.]{.underline}**

"The future of humanity is the struggle between humans that control
machines and machines that control humans. Between the democratization
of communication and usurpation of communication by artificial
intelligence," Assange warned. "**[[Undetectable mass social influence
powered by artificial intelligence is an existential threat to
humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The phenomena differs in traditional
attempts to shape cultural and political phenomena by operating at
scale, speed and increasingly at a subtlety that eclipses human
capacities."

**[The use of artificial intelligence for mass surveillance and
war-making]{.underline}** is only one of the destructive purposes to
which this transformative technology is being used under capitalism.

Already, **[artificial intelligence is being used at Amazon warehouses
to track every move employees make]{.underline}**. Amazon's systems
count how many times workers go to the bathroom and alert foremen if
workers stop to catch their breath in the up to 15 miles they are forced
to walk during a single shift. At companies such as Uber and Lyft,
artificial intelligence is used to push drivers to work longer and
harder, often to the detriment of their health and well-being.

But even more radical changes are on the horizon. As ride-sharing
companies and shipping lines rush to implement driverless cars, trucks
and boats, tens of thousands of jobs will be eliminated. T**[he
integration of AI with robotics will extend the wave of mass
automation]{.underline}** that has already **[displaced countless
thousands of industrial workers into every single field]{.underline}**,
from the building trades to food preparation, to custodial work and
retail.

According to a 2013 survey by Oxford University, nearly **[half of US
jobs will be destroyed by AI and robotics in the next two decades
alone]{.underline}**.

Since the industrial revolution, **[[capitalism has managed to transform
every development in technology into an instrument of human oppression
and butcher]{.mark}y]{.underline}**. The introduction of **[the
spinn[ing jenny]{.mark}]{.underline}** ushered in the horrendous social
misery of 19th century slums of London and Manchester. The **[[cotton
gin]{.underline}]{.mark}** brought a resurgence of American slavery.
**[[The airplane]{.underline}]{.mark}** was converted---through the
doctrine of "strategic bombing"---into a method for killing civilians by
the tens of thousands. **[And]{.underline}** the nearly limitless energy
created by **[[nuclear fission]{.underline}]{.mark}** was **[turned
into]{.underline}** a means of **[destroying]{.underline}** entire
societies, and perhaps **[humanity itself]{.underline}**.

But why should these technologies, which objectively create the
conditions for a massive expansion of the standard of living for
billions of people, be put to such horrendous uses? As the Russian
revolutionary Leon Trotsky wrote in 1926:

Technique and science have their own logic---the logic of the cognition
of nature and the mastering of it in the interests of man. But technique
and science develop not in a vacuum but in human society, which consists
of classes. The ruling class, the possessing class, controls technique
and through it controls nature. Technique in itself cannot be called
either militaristic or pacifistic. **[In a society in which the ruling
class is militaristic, technique is in the service of
militarism]{.underline}**. ("Radio, Science, Technique and Society")

**[[In the hands of the ruling elites that control society under
capitalism, every technological innovation becomes a
cudgel]{.underline}]{.mark}**: against the working class and against
countries they seek to conquer and suppress through military violence.

In different hands, the same technology will produce different results.
[**[In a socialist society, the artificial intelligence and robotics
revolution will create the circumstances for a massive
elevation]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}**]{.mark} not only **[the
economic [well-being]{.mark} of the population]{.underline}**, but
**[also]{.underline}** **[its cultural life]{.underline}**. The
replacement of tedious and back-breaking occupations will mean not mass
unemployment and destitution, but rather **[greater leisure and an
expansion of workers' opportunities for education, family life and
cultural enrichment.]{.underline}**

The automation of the building trades and the expansion of additive
manufacturing (3D printing) to construction will vastly reduce the
amount of labor required to build homes, schools and hospitals and
ensure excellent housing for all. The leveraging of artificial
intelligence in gene sequencing, drug development and analysis of
medical studies will result in unprecedented breakthroughs in human
health for the whole of humanity, not just the few who can pay soaring
drug prices.

**[The roboticization of both farming and transportation will vastly
reduce the cost of food, ending malnutrition and ensuring a high-quality
diet for all]{.underline}**---not the ruin of small farmers by
agriculture conglomerates.

In holding out this prospect for humanity, Marxists base themselves on
the traditions of the Enlightenment, which drew a connection between
human progress in science and society. Just as men like Isaac Newton
were unlocking the secrets of nature, so too society could be rationally
understood, and, once understood, changed for the better.

This view stands in direct contrast to the middle-class pessimists of
the Frankfurt School, who, in rejecting the Enlightenment, claimed that
the theory of gravity paved the way to the gas chambers of Auschwitz.
What demoralized intellectuals such as Herbert Marcuse and Max
Horkheimer---who falsely claimed to be students of Karl Marx and whose
theories are still palmed off as Marxism at universities---ignored was
precisely Trotsky's point: that "technique and science develop not in a
vacuum but in human society, which consists of classes."

The question is: Who controls the means of production, and thus society?

Two roads are open to humanity. **[The capitalist road offers a
relentless escalation of war, poverty, mass repression and totalitarian
dictatorship.]{.underline}** The road of **[[socialism offers not just
freedom from all those horrors, but the liberation of all mankind from
oppression]{.mark} and want.]{.underline}**

#### AI is bad -- it'll increase the inequality of capitalism even more

advisor to governments and companies; 7/2/18; "How Artificial
Intelligence Could Kill Capitalism";

accessed: 7/5/22; Lowell-JL\]

Without this happening, **[[humans]{.mark} [will]{.mark} find themselves
in a situation where they [have to go out and compete for whatever paid
jobs are still available to humans in the robot-dominated
workforce]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As a simple example, a fully automated
farm would, in theory, provide food at a far cheaper cost than one
staffed with human farm hands, machinery operators, administrative
staff, distributions operatives and security guards. However, if the
owner of the farm still parts with his goods to the highest bidder,
there would be inequalities in how that food is distributed among the
populace and the potential for a poverty-struck underclass which lacks
access to adequate sustenance. Nothing new there -- of course, this
underclass has always existed throughout history. However, it doesn't
exactly fit with the idea of the Star Trek utopia we need to have in
place before we can comfortably hand the reigns to the machines.

**[[This makes it]{.mark} something of [a "chicken and egg"
problem,]{.mark} and the ideal way for it to play out would seemingly be
a gradual and managed transition to a smart machine-driven
economy]{.underline}**. This process would involve careful oversight of
which human roles were being automated, and ensuring that the
"plentiful" resources are in place to support those who unfortunately do
find that they are being replaced, rather than merely "augmented."

The problem is that this would require two elements: A concerted and
informed effort from governments and regulators to understand the scale
of the challenge and enable the right framework for it to happen. And an
acceptance by those leading the charge -- the tech industry -- that
there is a more important motive than profit for getting the change
right.

Neither of those seems likely to happen any time soon. Despite the "make
the world a better place" ethos, big tech's overriding aim is still to
generate growth and profit for their enterprises.

Also, managing the political change could be an even tougher job than
persuading a tech CEO that she shouldn't be focusing on revenue or
profits.

"People aren't stupid," Chace says, while discussing how automated
driving systems look set to erode the employment opportunities for
humans whose trade is driving.

**["[They will see these robots driving around taking people's
jobs]{.mark},]{.underline}** and think 'it won't be long until they come
for mine' -- and then there will be a panic. And panics lead to very
nasty populist politicians, of the left or the right, being elected."

Chace also doesn't believe that the concept of universal basic income --
currently being trialed in some Scandinavian countries -- is the right
answer, or at least not in its current form.

"The problem with universal basic income is that it's basic. If all we
can do is give people a basic income, we've failed, and society probably
isn't saveable."

**[A future where the majority of humans live a subsistence-level income
funded by the fruits of a robotic labor force, while a "1 percent" upper
class -- those in control of the robots -- build their empires and reach
for the stars -- isn't appealing to those with an egalitarian
mindset]{.underline}**. However, it could be the direction we're heading
in.

#### AI has bad ramifications for workers

**Abdelrahman '22** (Maha, before joining the Centre of Development
Studies in 2007, Dr Abdelrahman worked as an Associate Professor of
Sociology at the American University in Cairo, "The Indefatigable
Worker: From Factory Floor to Zoom Avatar", page 79-80, ML)

[[AI is]{.mark} but a [recent]{.mark} technology in an [overarching
historical project in which a regime of labor surveillance and control
over workers' bodies has been evolving to respond to]{.mark} new
developments in [capitalism and]{.mark} to [emerging]{.mark} new
[tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}, regimes of expertise and measurement
capacities. [[These interventions,]{.mark} which are [intended to reduce
fatigue and to adapt the living machine of the worker's mind and body to
the rules of a dead machine without fatigue, have always been presented
as technical]{.mark}, scientific [and]{.mark} totally [free of politics
and ideology]{.mark}. One of the most fascinating features of this long
project of surveillance and control has been [its assumption of the
worker's body as one which is free of gender, sexual, racial or other
power relations]{.mark}. More significantly[, ostensibly putting the
well-being of the worker at the heart of this regime has made it
difficult for workers to reject these efforts which claim to help them
cope with fatigue and stress. This paradigm]{.mark} of caring
[has]{.mark} also [partly worked to obscure the conditions which create
workers' fatigue in the first place, making these conditions ever more
difficult to challenge.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### **The capitalist nature of AI development inevitably trades off with ethics.**

**Schwab '20** \[Katharine; deputy editor of Fast Company\'s technology
section; 10-5-2020; The biggest barrier to humane, ethical AI:
Capitalism itself; Fast Company;
https://www.fastcompany.com/90558020/ai-ethics-money-facial-recognition-fei-fei-li;
7-6-2022; SK\]

Over the last several years, a **[growing chorus of [academics]{.mark},
activists, [and technologists]{.mark} have [decried]{.mark} the ways in
which [a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence [tech]{.mark}nology
could engender bias, exacerbate [inequity]{.mark}, and violate civil
rights]{.underline}**.

But while these **[voices are getting louder, they still [butt up
against systems of power that value profit]{.mark} and the status quo
[over ensuring]{.mark} that [AI]{.mark} is [built in a way that isn't
harmful]{.mark} to marginalized people and society writ
large.]{.underline}**

In a panel discussion for Fast Company's 2020 Innovation Festival,
**[experts in ethical AI explained what they're up against in [trying to
change the way]{.mark} that [large companies and institutions think
about]{.mark} building and [deploying AI.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

For Timnit Gebru, the technical colead of the Ethical Artificial
Intelligence Team at Google**[, one challenge is that she [has to work
against the incentive structures inherent to capitalism]{.mark}. For
publicly traded companies such as Google, constantly [increasing profit
is the highest good]{.mark}. "You can't set up a system where [the only
incentive]{.mark} is [to make more money]{.mark} and then just assume
that people are going to magically be ethical]{.underline}**," she said.

When it comes to face recognition, the most controversial AI technology
right now, Gebru explains that it took a global protest movement against
police brutality for the host of large companies including Amazon, IBM,
and Microsoft that build the technology to reconsider what they were
deploying. **[Even so, [Amazon only agreed to]{.mark} a [one-year
moratorium on selling]{.mark} its [tech]{.mark}nology [to
police]{.mark}]{.underline}**. (In contrast, Google decided not to sell
facial recognition algorithms way back in 2018, and CEO Sundar Pichai
has indicated support for EU legislation to temporarily ban the
technology.)

Gebru advocates for changing the way AI is built through building
"pressure from all sides," including from internal advocates such as
herself, other tech workers, outside activists, everyday people,
journalists, regulators, and even shareholders.

"Internally, you can advocate for at least something that's not so
controversial, which is better documentation," Gebru said. "It means you
just have to test your system better, make it more robust. Even then if
you're asking for more resources to be deployed, why should they do that
if they think what people have been doing so far has been working well?"

**[Another challenge is the [sheer amount of money available for people
building AI systems]{.mark}. Even if large companies stay away from
selling face recognition to police to avoid a public relations disaster,
smaller upstarts such as the controversial Clearview AI will step in to
fill the void]{.underline}**. When money is on the line, it becomes more
**[[difficult to make decisions in the interest of society]{.mark}
rather than to pad a company's bottom line.]{.underline}**

"The reality is there's just **[a lot of easy money to be made in
AI,"]{.underline}** said Olga Russakovsky, an assistant professor of
computer science at Princeton University who focuses on computer vision.
"I think there's a lot of very legitimate concerns being raised, and I'm
very grateful these concerns are starting to come to the forefront, to
the center of these conversations. **[But there's [easy money]{.mark}
and that has been the case for the past at least 10 years. I think it's
[hard to resist]{.mark} that . . . and then have some of these deeper
and harder conversations."]{.underline}**

behind [Big Tech's unstoppable drive for growth]{.mark}, which [leads to

alter society's economic and social structures---we need to come up with
alternatives in terms of ownership and governance. The commons is
proposed as an alternative for thinking about how to organise AI
development and how to distribute the value that can be derived from it.
[Using the commons framework is also a way of giving society a more
prominent role in the debate]{.underline} about what we expect from AI
and how we should approach it.**

are [changing]{.mark} our [econ]{.mark}omy [and
society]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is argued that much of our productivity
and prosperity will be derived from the systems and machines we are
creating (Brynjolfsson et al. 2014; Hall and Pesenti 2017). Artificial
Intelligence (AI) is one of the most hyped innovations of our times. In
business circles, [[AI]{.mark} is seen as a [catalyst for
growth]{.mark}, which will manifestly [transform]{.mark} the
[econ]{.mark}omy]{.underline} (Agrawal et al. 2018; Lee 2018; McAfee and
Brynjolfsson 2017). Policymakers are [looking at the opportunities of AI
for tackling global challenges]{.underline}, such as climate change
(Dobbe and Whittaker 2019) or pandemics (Tzachor et al. 2020), while [AI
is also the subject of an arms race between the US, China and Russia to
have their military forces equipped with automated weapons]{.underline}
(Asaro 2019).**

**While AI is around for more than 60 years and periods of hope and
optimism have been alternated with so-called AI Winters, it seems
crucial parts of the puzzle finally have started to fall into place. The
confluence of factors---the availability of powerful computing capacity,
new techniques in machine/deep learning leading to more sophisticated
algorithms and the growing availability of data with which to train
these algorithms---enable AI to be deployed far more extensively
(Elliott 2019; Hall and Pesenti 2017; Lee 2018). AI now seems ready to
have a deep impact on our society and economy.**

**Especially, since 2015, a peak in corporate investment, [a [growing
number of]{.underline}]{.mark} [mergers and acquisitions and more
[intensive competitive hiring of AI talent]{.mark} can be
[noticed]{.mark}]{.underline} (Dyer-Witheford et al. 2019; Lee 2018).
This is not surprising given assessments about the (future) size of AI
in industry. For example, PwC (2017) predicts AI could contribute up to
\$15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. The same study states
that the greatest economic gains from AI will be in China (26% boost to
GDP by 2030) and North America (14.5% boost) (PwC 2017). This is not
unexpected as the US and China are in an intense competition to become
world leaders in AI (Lee 2018).**

**[The [industrial landscape of AI,]{.mark} however, is [dominated by
Big Tech]{.mark}, a small number of extremely powerful companies. There
are [only a few companies that own exponential computing power]{.mark},
can attract AI talent [and]{.mark} have [access to data]{.mark} to
develop and train advanced machine/deep learning models. AI is a General
Purpose Technology (GPT), an enabling technology that impacts on how
large sections of the economy and society are organised. Because AI is a
GPT, we [need to analyse AI capitalism]{.mark}. In particular, we want
to understand how AI capitalism is organised, what is driving its
concentration of power, and its impact. Beyond this, we also need to
[think about alternatives that]{.mark} can [help]{.mark} mitigate the
negative consequences of this power concentration and make sure that
[society at large can benefit from]{.mark} the new wave of [AI
innovation.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### **AI capitalism furthers [exploitative data management]{.underline} practices and exacerbates [inequality]{.underline}.**

**[The [emergence of AI capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**In the aftermath of the global financial and economic crisis of
2007--2008, two separate albeit related developments contributed to an
environment in which AI capitalism could emerge: [a changing political
context and a technological transformation.]{.underline}**

**First, the broader political context has changed by what Standing
(2016) calls a global transformation. Essentially, he refers to [a shift
in the political context [from neoliberalism]{.mark} to rentier
capitalism. Neoliberalism promotes free markets and includes other
dynamics and characteristics, such as commodification, privatisation and
labour market reregulation]{.underline} (not deregulation) in favour of
flexibility in terms of labour and capital (Harvey 2005). [[Rentier
capitalism]{.mark}, on the other hand, refers to a system in which
efforts are made to [enlarge one's existing share of wealth without
actually contributing to the creation of new wealth]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Christophers 2020; Standing 2016). It constitutes a model of
[[monopolistic rent-seeking]{.mark}, which often [leads to markets
dominated by]{.mark} a [small number of]{.mark} extremely powerful
[multinationals]{.mark}]{.underline} (Birch 2020).**

**Second, at the same time we are witnessing a technological
transformation, which increasingly dominates and transforms the
capitalist system. The technological element refers to the Internet and
other related digital technologies that emerged since the early 2000s
(social media, the Internet of Things and AI). Other scholars have
framed this digital capitalism (Schiller 2000), informational capitalism
(Fuchs 2010), platform capitalism (Srnicek 2017), data capitalism
(Sadowski 2019; West 2019) and AI capitalism (Dyer-Witheford et al.
2019).Footnote1**

**In the next paragraphs, I discuss the main building blocks of what
constitutes AI capitalism and identify the problems within it. I first
discuss the problems related to data (commodification and extraction)
and then elaborate on the concentration of power within the hiring of AI
talent and computing infrastructure.**

**The commodification of data**

**[[Commodification]{.mark} is a central concept]{.underline} in CPE and
refers to the processes, whereby online and offline objects, activities,
ideas and emotions are transformed into tradable commodities,
[transforming use value into exchange value]{.underline} (Hardy 2014).
In the context of AI capitalism[, commodification is [closely linked to
datafication]{.mark}]{.underline}. The latter concept refers to the
ability to render into data many aspects of the world that have never
been quantified before (Cukier and Mayer-Schoenberger 2013). Our social
relationships, communication patterns, shopping behaviour, etc. are
transformed into digital data (Couldry and Mejias 2019), which is an
essential characteristic of the attention economy (Wu 2017).**

**In AI capitalism, the [interplay between data and digital platforms is
important]{.underline}. Platforms are intermediaries that invite
different types of users---producers and suppliers, consumers,
advertisers, app developers, etc.---to engage and interact via their
digital infrastructure (Srnicek, 2017; Van Dijck et al. 2018). Platforms
are [ideally positioned to function as a data broker]{.underline}:
central in their business model is the possibility to capture, extract
and analyse the data produced by the interactions on the platform (Crain
2018; West 2019). Using this extracted data as well as the skills
workers gained when analysing it, made platform companies the leaders in
the digital economy; working with data has become ever more important
for gaining a competitive advantage (Srnicek 2018).**

**What connects data and platforms are network effects. Network effects
mean that the value of the network is determined by its size (Katz and
Shapiro 1985). Platforms thus become more valuable as more users join
it. Engagement and interaction are only possible if there are active
users on platforms. Generating network effects is thus a key strategic
focus for platforms (Srnicek 2017). The power of network effects goes
hand in hand with the availability of data: this combination further
strengthens the leading position of already powerful data companies
(Srnicek 2018). Data-driven network effects entail that more users
active on a certain platform, means more possibilities for data
collection, analysis and extraction. Consequently, this results in more
opportunities to use that data for improving the features and services
offered by the platform. Better services open up the possibility to
attract more users. A similar positive data feedback loop exists for AI
too: better access to data means more opportunities to train ML models
and better AI also results in better services and more users (Lee 2018;
Srnicek 2018; Varian 2018).**

**[Data extraction]{.underline}**

**[A second key characteristic of AI capitalism is the centrality of
[data]{.mark} extraction]{.underline}. We can conceptualise data as two
distinct economic forms: First, data is a raw material---constant
capital---which is necessary for the production of commodities (Crain
2018). AI companies use data such as raw materials to produce various
informational goods and services, what Shoshana Zuboff (2019) calls
prediction products. [Data sets are an essential resource to train ML/DL
models. Second, data itself [is a commodity]{.mark}, the [product of the
digital labour]{.mark} of people engaging with applications and services
offered by platforms.]{.underline}**

**While data is often considered as a raw material or a commodity, it
makes sense to conceptualise it as a form of capital too. This is part
of a broader discussion about how value is generated in the contemporary
economy (Arvidsson and Colleoni 2012; Mazzucato 2018), particularly how
value is derived from data and what normative aspects are relevant in
the context of data collection and extraction (Couldry and Mejias 2019;
Mezzadra and Neilson 2017; Zuboff 2019). Sadowski (2019) argues that
treating data as capital allows for a more nuanced and detailed
understanding of how AI capitalism functions and is organised.**

**What is the problem with using data to create value, as a resource to
develop and optimise AI systems[? Mazzucato (2018) analyses
[contemporary capitalism]{.mark} and highlights the critique that it
[rewards rent seekers over true value creators]{.mark}. Their rent
seeking is [based on overcharging]{.mark} prices, [undercutting
competition]{.mark}---by exploiting particular advantages, e.g., labour,
or using a monopoly advantage]{.underline}. Where value creation refers
to the use of different types of resources to produce new goods and
services, value extraction is defined as "activities focused on moving
around existing resources and outputs, and gaining disproportionally
from the ensuing trade" (Mazzucato 2018: 6). Data extraction is a
particular type of value extraction. Sadowski (2019: 9) defines data
extraction as: "data is taken without meaningful consent and fair
compensation for the producers and sources of data". Evgeny Morozov
(2018) follows a similar line of thinking and has coined data
extractivism to refer to practices of tech giants launching products not
for the revenue but for the data, which is afterwards monetised through
different products and services (see also Couldry and Mejias 2019). It
is clear we must scrutinise what the consequences are of data
commodification and extraction in AI capitalism as well as considering
alternatives.**

**[AI talent]{.underline}**

**[[AI capitalism]{.mark} is [dominated by]{.mark} the so-called [Big
Tech]{.mark}; tech giants that [dominate and control the market]{.mark}.
These companies are often referred to by the acronyms GAFAM and BAT
(Kaplan and Haenlein 2020; Verdegem 2022). GAFAM refers to US-based
companies and includes Google (Alphabet), Apple, Facebook (Meta), Amazon
and Microsoft. BAT refers to tech companies in China, including Baidu,
Alibaba and Tencent.]{.underline}**

**[Especially, since 2015, the leading tech companies have
[intensified]{.mark} the [competition for]{.mark} hiring [AI
talent]{.mark}, i.e., the computer science experts who are at the
forefront of developments in machine/deep learning (CB Insights 2021).
They mainly do this by acquiring AI startups and only face competition
from blockchain companies and the military.]{.underline}**

**[Google (Alphabet) purchasing the UK-based startup DeepMind (founded
in 2010), the company that developed the DL models behind the famous
victory of AlphaGo over Lee Sedol, is one of the most famous examples of
acquisitions in the field of AI. Since then, DeepMind has become one of
the world's leading AI companies]{.underline}. All of the mentioned Big
Tech companies have been very active in taking over startup companies
with the purpose of acquiring AI expertise and talent. According to CB
Insights (2021), Apple has made 29 AI acquisitions since 2010, Google
(Alphabet) 15, Microsoft 13, Facebook (Meta) 12 and Amazon 7. A similar
pattern is followed by Big Tech in China (Lee 2018).**

**While companies, such as IBM, Intel, Salesforce and NVIDIA---active in
hardware (semiconductors) and software development---also try to
establish themselves in the growing market and engage in take-overs of
AI startups, the fiercest competition is happening at the level of
smaller companies and/or startups. These companies are positioning
themselves to either trying to occupy a profitable AI niche (which they
hope might develop into a larger segment of the market) or to be taken
over by one of the giants (Lee 2018). The problem this intense
competition for AI talent creates is that it leads to a divide between
the developers of ML/DL models who are hired by Big Tech and who can ask
enormous salaries (Metz 2017), and the rest of computer scientists and
other groups in society who are paid less or are even exploited for
doing the work in the hidden infrastructure of AI (Crawford 2021;
Altenried 2020). Hence, the need for alternatives becomes more
prominent.**

**AI compute capacity**

**AI capitalism is not only determined by data
commodification/extraction and the fierce competition over AI talent;
another aspect that is crucial for AI dominance is computing power
(Ahmed and Wahed 2020; Srnicek 2019). AI compute capacity refers to
hardware and software engineered to support the development of AI
applications. It includes large data centres, supercomputers and cloud
providers. Having the most powerful and performant AI compute capacity
is necessary for dominating the AI market.**

**Amazon (Amazon Web Services---AWS, launched in 2002) and Microsoft
(Azure, launched in 2008) have traditionally been dominant in the market
of cloud computing. More recently, especially since 2015, there have
been major investments in data centres, supercomputers and cloud
computing (Dyer-Witheford et al. 2019; Srnicek 2019). This can be
explained by the fact that more businesses---beyond tech---became
data-driven and need this infrastructure to process the data being
collected as part of new services and business models. Still, the
biggest investments in AI compute capacity are made by Big Tech.
Companies such as Alibaba (Aliyun), Baidu (Wangpan), Google (Google
Cloud) and Tencent (Tencent Cloud) have been investing massively in
cloud computing with the goal to increase their market share (Verdegem
2022).**

**There is a clear explanation, relevant to our understanding of AI
capitalism, why Big Tech has stepped up its investment in AI compute
capacity. For making AI applications a reality---such as self-driving
cars or AI systems used in the medical sector---an upgraded technical
infrastructure is crucial. Performant computing infrastructure is an
absolute key issue in terms of security, reliability, and speed. The
roll-out of new AI systems diminishes the tolerance towards network
latency and security issues. [The problem is that only big companies,
which have a lot of capital at their disposal, can make these
investments.]{.underline} In addition, it is only Big Tech that has the
resources to upgrade their compute capacity while simultaneously being
able to collect data to train ML/DL models and to hire the specialised
AI talent to work on these models. Ahmed and Wahed (2020) have
documented the unequal access to compute capacity and argue that this
creates divides between big tech corporations and elite universities who
squeeze other companies and the computer departments of medium and
smaller universities out of the field. Srnicek (2019) also points at the
power of AI behemoths, who become global rentiers through their AI
infrastructure[: smaller companies are dependent on the hardware of Big
Tech to make advancements in AI]{.underline}, whereas the leading AI
companies can keep control over what is happening on their
infrastructure. This power [concentration is thus also potentially
weakening the development of AI itself.]{.underline}**

**[The [AI industrial landscape: a concentration of
power]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[The AI industrial landscape is [dominated by]{.mark} a [small number
of companies]{.mark}.]{.underline} Table 1 gives an overview of how much
the value of each of these giants (GAFAM and BAT) has increased in the
last decade. This table illustrates how the commodification of data, in
combination with data extraction, made these companies extremely
profitable. The top ten of most valuable companies in the world is now
dominated by AI companies (Statista 2020). Their drive for expansion
resulted in intense concentration, where each one of them has achieved a
highly dominant position in the market (Kaplan and Haenlein 2020; Montes
and Goertzel 2019). For example, Google obtained an (almost) monopoly
over online search, Amazon and Alibaba over e-commerce and Facebook and
Tencent over the US and Chinese markets of social networking.**

**The [drive for growth of AI companies demonstrates that the [problem
of monopolisation is real]{.mark}: it [creates a massive power
concentration]{.mark} in the hands of a few players]{.underline}. The AI
giants dominate the field and aggressively acquire potential
competitors. [We face a situation, where there are only a few AI
behemoths]{.underline}, who own the expensive computational
infrastructure, have access to vast amounts of data to train ML and DL
models and can attract the highly skilled AI talent to develop new
systems and services. The economic power, expressed in their rapidly
increasing value, highlights the point of AI as a GPT creating winners
and losers (Trajtenberg 2018). The AI giants are definitely the winners
in this context.**

**Table 1 also illustrates that the COVID-19 pandemic has only
accelerated the tendency of expansion and monopolisation. The value of
the AI giants has grown exponentially since the start of the pandemic,
as we are all massively dependent on their digital services. One of the
risks of this domination is that these companies alone have the economic
power to make political decisions about how AI is developed, how it is
used and what its impact will be. It is an illustration of the
winner-take-all scenario (Srnicek 2017).**

**What is a source of concern is that the [AI giants follow a strategy
of enclosure, with the objective to maintaining their leading position
and safeguarding their growth and profit]{.underline}. Enclosure entails
that---after having achieved a monopolistic position---these [[AI
companies]{.mark} move to [control access to]{.mark} their [data]{.mark}
and limit the ability of users to switch to competitors]{.underline},
thereby enclosing more and more of the digital world within their
private sphere (Couldry and Mejias 2019; Morozov 2018).**

**The enclosure by AI capitalism is clearly illustrated by OpenAI.
Originally founded as a non-profit organisation, which would collaborate
with other institutions and researchers and make their research open to
the public, OpenAI is now dominated by corporate investors, including
Microsoft, and is considered as one of the biggest competitors of
DeepMind.**

**In this context, it becomes [[clear that we]{.mark}---as a
society---[need to]{.mark} reflect on this situation and [come up with
alternatives]{.mark}]{.underline} so to avoid we end up as losers, under
the control of the winners, the AI giants. Only criticising the problems
of AI capitalism, however, will not be enough. As a society, we need to
start imagining what alternatives could challenge the power
concentration of Big Tech. Critical political economy offers a framework
to inquire about this.**

#### AI expansion is capitalist

**Damon, 18,** Andre Damon, Writer and Editor for the World Wide
Socialist Web, 6/4/2018"Capitalism and the artificial intelligence
revolution",
<https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2018/04/06/pers-a06.html> - FT

**[The use of artificial intelligence for mass surveillance and
war-making is only one of the destructive purposes to which this
transformative technology is being used under capitalism. Already,
artificial intelligence is being used at Amazon warehouses to track
every move employees make.]{.underline}** Amazon's systems count how
many times workers go to the bathroom and alert foremen if workers stop
to catch their breath in the up to 15 miles they are forced to walk
during a single shift. At companies such as Uber and Lyft, artificial
intelligence is used to push drivers to work longer and harder, often to
the detriment of their health and well-being. But even more radical
changes are on the horizon. As ride-sharing companies and shipping lines
rush to implement driverless cars, trucks and boats, tens of thousands
of jobs will be eliminated. The integration of AI with robotics will
extend the wave of mass automation that has already displaced countless
thousands of industrial workers into every single field, from the
building trades to food preparation, to custodial work and retail.
**[According to a 2013 survey by Oxford University, [nearly half of US
jobs will be destroyed by AI]{.mark} and robotics in the next two
decades alone.]{.underline}** Since the industrial revolution,
**[[capitalism]{.mark} has managed to [transform]{.mark} every
development in technology into an instrument of human oppression and
butchery.]{.underline}** The introduction of the spinning jenny ushered
in the horrendous social misery of 19th century slums of London and
Manchester. The cotton gin brought a resurgence of American slavery. The
airplane was converted---through the doctrine of "strategic
bombing"---**[into a method for killing civilians by the tens of
thousands. And the nearly limitless energy created by nuclear fission
was turned into a means of destroying entire societies, and perhaps
humanity itself]{.underline}**. But why should these technologies, which
objectively create the conditions for a massive expansion of the
standard of living for billions of people, be put to such horrendous
uses? As the Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky wrote in 1926: Technique
and science have their own logic---the logic of the cognition of nature
and the mastering of it in the interests of man. But technique and
science develop not in a vacuum but in human society, which consists of
classes. **[The ruling class, the [possessing class, controls
technique]{.mark} and through it [controls
nature]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Te**[chnique in itself cannot be called
either militaristic or pacifistic. In a society in which the ruling
class is militaristic, technique is in the service of
militarism.]{.underline}** ("Radio, Science, Technique and Society") In
the hands of the ruling elites that control society under capitalism,
every technological innovation becomes a cudgel: **[against the working
class and against [countries]{.mark} they [seek to conquer and]{.mark}
[suppress through]{.mark} military [violence.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In
different hands, the same technology will produce different results. In
a socialist society, the artificial intelligence and robotics revolution
will create the circumstances for a massive elevation of not only the
economic well-being of the population, but also its cultural life. The
replacement of tedious and back-breaking occupations will mean not mass
unemployment and destitution, but rather greater leisure and an
expansion of workers' opportunities for education, family life and
cultural enrichment. The automation of the building trades and the
expansion of additive manufacturing (3D printing) to construction will
vastly reduce the amount of labor required to build homes, schools and
hospitals and ensure excellent housing for all. The leveraging of
artificial intelligence in gene sequencing, drug development and
analysis of medical studies will result in unprecedented breakthroughs
in human health for the whole of humanity, not just the few who can pay
soaring drug prices. The roboticization of both farming and
transportation will vastly reduce the cost of food, ending malnutrition
and ensuring a high-quality diet for all---not the ruin of small farmers
by agriculture conglomerates.

I have to ask: What politics are being continued here? To my mind**[,
presenting U.S. aerial strikes as sporadic and disconnected yet also
precise and strategic acts of violence does a number of
thing]{.underline}**s. First**[, it focuses analysis on these individual
acts, when in reality the U.S. is carrying out [a program of widespread
violence](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2021/03/02/countterorrism-cost-us-military),
committed not only against individuals in militant groups, but against
civilians and their communities]{.underline}**, and the states in which
they are situated. Secondly, **[[the focus on and fetishizing of the
"precision" of the weapons used helps to present U.S. war and violence
as
more ["civilized"](https://twailr.com/capitalism-civilisation-and-international-law/) than
that of other countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Taken together, I **[see
U.S. practices in the [war on terror as indicative of a politics

and [a capitalist politics of militarized
accumulation](https://www.ppesydney.net/content/uploads/2021/01/14_Robinson-and-Rodriguez.pdf)]{.mark}.
The "precision" drone strikes of the targeted killing program, for
example, highlight the neo-colonial nature of U.S. actions in the Middle
East and Africa: these "[precision" strikes are justified in the name of
U.S. security and self-defense]{.mark}, [and arguably go far beyond what
is sanctioned by international
law](https://www.justsecurity.org/75010/bidens-first-strike-and-the-international-law-of-self-defense/)]{.underline}**;
but these choices are available to the U.S. [because of its privileged
position in the international legal
system,](https://doi.org/10.3318/isia.2020.31.14) and because of the
localities in which these actions are carried out, i.e. **[in the Global

Robert Knox, senior lecturer in law at the University of Liverpool's

**[[The trend toward a neoliberal global economy and the prevalence
militaries and militarism worldwide are often treated as
separate]{.mark}, unrelated phenomena]{.underline}**. Many activists and
scholars who critique and challenge the negative effects of increasing
global integration emphasize economic factors (e.g., Bales, 1999;
Chossudovsky, 1997; Greider, 1997; Mander and Goldsmith, 1996; Sassen,
1998; Teeple, 1995). These include the fact that workers in one country
are pitted against those of another as corporate managers seek to
maximize profits, that systems of inequality based on gender, race,
class, and nation are inherent in the international division of labor,
that nation-states are cutting social welfare supports, that women and
children experience super exploitation especially in countries of the
global South, and that there is increasing polarization of material
wealth between rich and poor countries, as well as within richer
countries. Critics also point to the role of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization (WTO),
which require structural changes to make economies more profitable for
private investors and to open markets for so-called free trade.

Activists and scholars who are concerned primarily with militarism and
de-militarization critique the prevalence of war or the threat of war to
resolve transnational and intranational disputes (e.g., Reardon, 1996;
Hague Appeal for Peace, 1999). They point to bloated military budgets
that absorb resources needed for socially useful programs in many
countries, to the fact that civilians make up the vast majority of the
casualties of contemporary warfare, and that massive numbers of people
are displaced - 90% of them women and children - as a result of wars.
**[[They note the profitability of the arms trade]{.mark}. They also
emphasize [connections between militarism and violence]{.mark} against
women, and [the incidence of human rights violations in military
conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

We are not suggesting that such analysts and commentators see no overlap
between these two clusters of issues. However, **[[in critiquing and
challenging neoliberal economic integration, it is essential to take
account of militarism as an intrinsic element]{.mark}. Conversely, in
analyzing militarism, war, and armed conflict, it is also necessary to
consider global economic forces and institutions. The goal of this
special issue, then, is to show how [neoliberalism and militarism are
inextricably linked]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### 3 - Only demilitarization solves neoliberalism - continued weapon production and sales link back and re-affirm capitalist militarization 

**Kirk '2k** \[Gwyn and Margo Okazawa-Rey; author and scholar-activist
concerned with gender, racial and environmental justice, American
professor emerita, educator, writer, social justice activist, and a
founding member of the Combahee River Collective; Neoliberalism,
Militarism, and Armed Conflict, "Goals of This Special Issue," p. 14\]
SPark

The **[[analyses]{.underline}]{.mark}** in this special issue **[[show
the need for understanding connections]{.mark} between neoliberalism and
militarism]{.underline}** and for addressing this linkage through
activist efforts. **[[This means opposing]{.underline}]{.mark}** Plan
Columbia, for example, as a **[[neoliberal strategy as well as a
military]{.mark} [intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}** into the FARC\'s
struggle for self determination. It means exposing the fraud of the War
on Drugs in the United States, Latin America, and elsewhere, and
articulating genuine solutions to the problem of poverty and lack of
economic opportunity for small drug producers and users.

**[Opposing neoliberalism also means seeking effective strategies toward
de-militarization]{.underline}**, **[[dismantling the permanent war
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and working for economic justice in a
world of limited resources. It means opening up public discourse on the
economic reasons for war, the profitability of arms sales, and the costs
of militarism in human, environmental, and economic terms. Steps toward
demilitarization include:

**[[Decommissioning weapons]{.mark} of mass destruction and [opposing
the militarization of space]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[Reducing weapons production and sales]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and
promoting initiatives for conversion of military-based industries to
provide for civilian needs.

Developing nonmilitary forms of strength to counter military threats,
and expanding and disseminating current knowledge and experience of
peaceful resolution to conflicts.

Developing renewable sources of energy.

**[Stopping the glorification of war]{.underline}** and warriors,
supporting initiatives like the Hague Appeal for Peace and UNESCO\'s
culture of peace, and defining adventure and heroism in nonmilitary
terms.

**[Broadening notions of conventional masculinity and femininity and
delinking masculinity and militarism]{.underline}**.

Developing genuinely democratic processes and structures for political
and economic decision-making at community, national, and transnational
levels.

Redirecting public spending to meet human and environmental needs and
opposing assaults on locally

## Cyber Security

### 2NC \-- Ext: Cyber Security Link

#### Cybercrime is a threat to capitalism, building up defense and deterrence is a vehicle of which protecting capitalism hides behind

**Dallas Morning 21** \[Dallas Morning, 5-18-2021, \"Cybercrime is a
growing threat to capitalism and national security,\" Dallas News,
https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/2021/05/18/cybercrime-is-a-growing-threat-to-capitalism-and-national-security/,
smarx, HHW\]

[Not all crises can be anticipated, but some **[persistent threats
deserve more attention]{.mark} than they get**.]{.underline}

Case in point is the [[cyberattack that crippled]{.mark} the Colonial
[Pipeline]{.mark} and [caused fuel shortages]{.mark} across the eastern
seaboard. According to published reports, the [pipeline's owners paid a
ransom]{.mark} to DarkSide, a Russia-based criminal organization, to get
its operation back on board.]{.underline} In a looking-glass moment,
DarkSide issued a statement declaring that its goal is to obtain cash,
and it did not have a political objective, as if that makes things
better.

[**[Cyberattacks are increasing in magnitude and frequency]{.mark}**,
[raising concerns]{.mark} that [executives aren't]{.mark}
[focused]{.mark} enough **[on this threat to their businesses]{.mark}**,
as well as the cascading impact on the overall economy and national
security]{.underline}. In a digitally connected world, the [importance
of realistic risk assessments, firewalls and ways to protect critical
data and services can't be overstated]{.underline}.

["[Business executives]{.mark} have to [stop looking at cybersecurity
as]{.mark} a [technical risk issue]{.mark}," said Chris Krebs, former
director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the
Department of Homeland Security]{.underline}, during an interview Sunday
on CBS' Face the Nation. "[It **[truly is a business risk
issue]{.mark}**, and we are talking about the resilience of the U.S.
economy."]{.underline}

What DarkSide did to the pipeline amounts to breaking into your house,
stealing your valuables and changing all the locks to keep you out until
you relent to its demands.

[[To pay encourages more threats]{.mark} to other companies. Not to pay
risks the loss of millions, if not billions, of dollars from a prolonged
shutdown. And it's [not like you will get]{.mark} your [valuables
back]{.mark}, unscathed and with no questions asked]{.underline}. Data
breaches usually end up with sensitive financial information being sold
and resold on the dark web, creating other opportunities for cybercrime.

[About **[85% of our nation's critical assets]{.mark}, systems and
networks [are]{.mark} in [private]{.mark} hands**, and their
incapacitation would have a debilitating effect on national and economic
security, public health and safety.]{.underline} Private banks control
our financial system. Private electricity providers control the grid.
Private railroads and airlines move people, goods and services. And the
list goes on.

**[[Cyberattacks target]{.mark} [the lifeblood of modern
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- the seamless digital global
networks that encourage convenient commerce with customers and
suppliers. [[When cybercriminals]{.mark}, who may or may not have direct
ties to rogue states, [leverage]{.mark} the [power]{.mark} of computers
and internet connectivity [to shake down businesses]{.mark},
**[executives need to elevate cybersecurity on the list of]{.mark}
corporate [priorities]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.**

[The precise [number of private companies targeted]{.mark} for ransom is
[difficult to calculate]{.mark} since companies are reluctant to talk
about breaches and will pay up if compromised]{.underline}. Homeland
Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas speculated that ransomware losses
may be more than \$300 million so far this year --- up 300% from last
year. "[**[The threat is real,"]{.mark}** Mayorkas said. "The threat is
upon us. The risk is to all of us."]{.underline}

Delegate to the federal convention in 2022; The Great Mindshift, "How to
Work a Great Mindshift for Sustainability Transformations," Ch. 5, p.
155-156\] SPark

The good news is that **[[even if there might not be visible
changes]{.mark} for a long time, [this work is not undertaken for
nothing]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Think back to the development and also
ignition phase in the s-curve. **[[Each choice to do differently, each
questioning]{.mark} of the stated purpose or reasons, [impacts]{.mark}
the former reference [frameworks, mind-sets and knowledge
reservoirs]{.mark}. [It offers alternative meaning, delegitimizes the
notion that there are no alternative claims, and offers ideas about
other ways of]{.mark} acting or [doing things]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Of
course much structural power rests with those who benefit from the
status quo and its hegemonic paradigm. But **[as Meadows wrote, many
individuals--- change [research suggests about 60 % of people in a
system---are open minded and willing to learn]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[This is where radical]{.mark}]{.underline}** incremental
**[[transformation]{.mark} [begins]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as
illustrated nicely in Fig. 5.1. It stems from Ray Ison, professor of the
Systems for Sustainability program at the Monash Sustainability
Institute in Australia. I was fortunate enough to sit next to him at a
conference on decoupling human well-being from resource use and after my
presentation he told me he had just finished an article that he felt was
relevant to my thinking. The following illustration (Fig. 5.1) is indeed
spot on, even though his terminology is of course different:

Ison's article summarizes 14 years of experience in transdisciplinary
research on system innovation processes. As a result, he and his
colleagues put "social learning" at the heart of their framework:
**[[humans engage in making sense of a situation by socially
constructing the issue]{.mark} at stake. [Through this process they
either reify or change both their understanding of a situation and the
practices in which they engage. Sometimes this entails amending the
institutional setup]{.mark}]{.underline}** (made visible as elements of
a situation in the right hand graph). Change and dynamic adaptation is
the normal state of being in a complex living system. So **[[each
alternative viewpoint, each act done differently, amends the framework
for action in the future]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

So, in essence, **[[we]{.mark} [can]{.mark}no[t]{.mark} [not be part of
changing the world]{.mark}. [The decision that lies with us concerns our
choice to become aware of this and use it intentionally]{.mark}--- even
if cause and effect are not always visible or impressive. Over time and
through collective or concerted action, the situational amendments
transform the system in question even if each shifting from one dynamic
stage to another is in itself not very radical or
disruptive]{.underline}** (here indicated as S1 to Sn in the left hand
graph). As part of this process, the boundaries of one system may also
be adjusted and thence the scope of what a particular transformation
process involves.

So **[[each questioning sparks thought processes in others]{.mark}---[an
inspiration or irritation that influences]{.mark} the [dynamics]{.mark}.
[Each silence might be interpreted as others please]{.mark}. And we
never know when exactly that last incremental activity necessary to
prompt a social or ecological tipping point for wider and
deeper---radical---regime changes occurs. [Social scientists' research
findings suggest that 10 percent of the people in any given system
provides the critical mass where new ideas or opinions start spreading
rapidly]{.mark}]{.underline}** (SCNARC 2011).

In order to strategically influence these permanently ongoing processes
of learning and adaptation, **[[it is important to open up a target
system: to assess and understand the crucial path]{.mark} dependencies
[and which purpose or generative imaginary they are
serving]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This involves infrastructures and
technologies, as STS **[[research]{.underline}]{.mark}** would point
out, the ecological embeddedness that SES approaches highlight, and the
**[[enforceable laws, role definitions, and mind-sets that
political]{.mark} economist [emphasize.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

## Paradigm Shift

### 1NC \-- Alt \-- Paradigm Shift

#### The re-arrangement of priorities to doing better and doing well solves - it combines and builds on existing initiatives that are experiencing success now

**Göpel '16** \[Maja; 2016; Secretary General of the German Advisory

"Introduction," Ch. 1, p. 9-10\] SPark

Some of **[the detrimental effects these concepts have on]{.underline}**
understanding how to reach **[the goals of sustainable development are
discussed by bringing in]{.underline}** insights from twenty-first
century **[social and natural sciences]{.underline}** as well as
alternative economic thought. Earth system sciences, ecological
economics, sociology, well-being studies, psychology and neurosciences
have much to say about human needs, nature's laws and the impact on both
of these of economic growth-driven societies. **[Adding these findings
to the picture shows that the paradigm and ideas that informed the
creation of unsustainable system dynamics cannot guide their
removal]{.underline}**.

So **[[which paradigm can achieve this]{.underline}]{.mark}? [This [is
the key question]{.mark}]{.underline}** that spans Chap. 4 and **[the
case studies on pioneers working with different imaginaries of what the
purpose of sustainable development could mean in
practice.]{.underline}** With the intention of investigating which key
ideas or concepts **[[a new and transformational development paradigm
could build on]{.underline}]{.mark}**, I took a closer look at the
following initiatives: the Economy for the **[[Common
Good]{.underline}]{.mark}** (a prominent business initiative in Germany
and Austria), **[[Transition Towns]{.underline}]{.mark}** (an urban
community initiative born in the United Kingdom), **[the Commoning
Movement]{.underline}** (civil society initiative spanning the Atlantic
between the United States and Europe) **[as well as the]{.underline}**
Bhutanese Gross National Happiness (**[[GNH)
Framework]{.underline}]{.mark}** (government initiatives that want to
supplement GDP with other performance indicators).

Although I would not venture to state that one can define a clear-cut
new paradigm or streamlining development purpose like, for example,
'economic growth,' I was surprised by **[[the common ground between
theory and practice]{.mark} as well as [across practice
examples]{.mark}. [The worldviews of how to understand human needs and
nature's laws]{.mark} and the narratives about what development should
therefore aim to achieve [are very similar]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[All]{.mark} of these [movements adopt the view that ecological
systems host sociocultural systems]{.mark} and that [economic systems
are subordinate means in successfully structuring nature--human
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[This is radically different to the
view of the mainstream paradigm that pursues the ongoing integration of
social and environmental concerns into economic governance logics by
pricing them]{.underline}**. So I would go as far as to set one common
heuristic that expresses the radical purpose and another to capture the
strategic directions that the incremental steps of these pioneers are
taking.

The radical repurposing agenda could be summarized as recoupling
economic processes with human well-being and nature's laws by making the
economic dimension the one that needs changing. Given the structural
reality of today's path dependencies, **[the foremost strategy for
successive change]{.underline}** in this direction---the incremental
strategies that can achieve it---**[is double-decoupling]{.underline}**:

1**[. [Decouple]{.mark} the [production]{.mark} of goods and services
[from unsustainable, wasteful or uncaring treatment of humans, nature
and animals]{.mark} (do better).]{.underline}**

**[2. [Decouple]{.mark} the [satisfaction of human needs from]{.mark}
the imperative to deliver ever more [economic output]{.mark} (do
well).]{.underline}**

#### Replacing the GDP with a new holistic indicator for common good solves

Political Sciences of the Catholic University Rafael Landivar (URL) of
Guatemala; Sustainable Development in the Anthropocene, "The Matrix of
the 'Common Good'," Ch. 5.7.1, p. 261-262\] SPark

The first **[[pioneering]{.mark} [initiative]{.mark}]{.underline}**
worth describing **[[comes]{.mark} from the business
world]{.underline}**, and originates **[[from]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
well-known concept of **[[corporate social
responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**, based on the idea of **[[finding
a balance between]{.mark} [responsibility to]{.mark}wards the
[community]{.mark} [and]{.mark} free [enterprise]{.mark}
[because]{.mark} [neither works in isolation]{.mark}]{.underline}**:
individuals need to cooperate to "flourish and create wealth", while the
community needs individual entrepreneurship to maintain its ability to
adapt and diversify the goods and services that are produced. According
to the proposal of **[Christian Felber]{.underline}**, author of The
Economy for the Common Good and the main **[leader of the
movement]{.underline}**, the **[key to sustainability lies in connecting
the private sector to]{.underline}** the old Christian idea of the
**[common good]{.underline}**, hence the name, because if a company is
conducted in an appropriate and honest way it undoubtedly contributes to
the welfare of all, i.e. operates for the common good.

**[The [movement proposes new rules]{.mark}]{.underline}** for the game,
**[one of which [is to avoid]{.mark} regarding the
[externalization]{.mark} [of]{.mark} social or environmental
[costs]{.mark}]{.underline}** (use of water or forest resources,
polluting greenhouse gases) as a 'competitive advantage'. Naturally,
either all entrepreneurs agree to internalize these costs (paying
special taxes for emitting GHG or for the use of water, for example), or
competitors who do not internalize them have greater benefits thanks to
these subsidies of nature. Hence new rules are required and these must
be accepted by all on the basis of social responsibility, or at least by
a majority if the internalization responds to a legal obligation.
Consequently, **[these new rules with internalized costs]{.underline}**
(formerly subsidized by nature) **[must be reflected in balance sheets
which no longer measure economic well-being by indicators of
exchange-value but instead by those of use-value.]{.underline}**

Indeed, **[[the common good movement]{.mark} has [proposed that GDP be
replaced]{.mark} at macroeconomic level [by the new indicator]{.mark}
product of the common good]{.underline}**, which should be **[reflected
at micro-economic level with [a]{.mark} new [type of balance sheet for
the common]{.mark} good]{.underline}** (Common Good Balance Sheet or
**[[CGBC]{.underline}]{.mark}**). Since 2010 this new indicator has been
used by a pioneering group of 70 European businessmen who
**[by]{.underline}** the middle of 2015 had increased to 1811, along
with 232 clubs and more than 6,000 individual members. As for
[the]{.mark} **[[indicators]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the common good,
there **[[are]{.mark} [five]{.mark} [categories]{.mark}]{.underline}** -
**[[human dignity]{.mark}, [solidarity]{.mark}, [social justice]{.mark},
[ecological sustainability,]{.mark} and [democratic decision-making
and]{.mark} [transparency]{.mark}]{.underline}** - which can be applied
to groups or stakeholders such as suppliers, financial creditors,
employees and co-owners, partners, and clientele. Moreover there are
**[indicators of bad behaviour connected with the violation of labour
standards]{.underline}** established by the ILO and the OECD, such as
**[human rights, labour protection, environmental standards, tax
evasion, the secret use of payments to lobbyists, subsidiaries, prices
below cost, and dumping.]{.underline}**

The initiative of the common good encourages communities and local
governments to support this type of business with consumer loyalty and
public recognition, and even to make their own evaluations in the
so-called "common good regions" which already exist in 45 countries,
including Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the UK,
Greece and the United States. **[[The]{.mark} vision]{.underline}** of
the movement **[is to have a global reach]{.underline}**, **[which
[means]{.mark}]{.underline}** fostering self-reliance and promoting
**[[changes to overarching]{.mark} regime
[structures]{.mark}]{.underline}** in **[such]{.underline}** a way
**[that the 'normal' hegemonic mentality guided by]{.underline}**
interest in economic gains and **[profits is transformed]{.underline}**,
along with the way of doing business,
**[[introducing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for instance, Göpel's ideas
about **[[doing things well and doing things
better]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Göpel 2016: 112-126).

### 2NC \-- Ext \-- Paradigm Shift

#### Good living solves -- Bolivia [proves]{.underline}

According to Barié (2017), **[[the concept]{.mark}s [of buen
vivir]{.mark} and Madre Tierra or Pachamama [are]{.mark} [the most novel
aspects]{.mark} of the new constitutions of both Bolivia and
Ecuador]{.underline}**. **[Regarding the concept of buen vivir (good
living), it is evident that [all good living can be understood as the
satisfaction of human needs]{.mark}, because '[living well' and 'good
living']{.mark} [are]{.mark} quite clearly [terms]{.mark} that [refer to
a]{.mark} rich [life in which both]{.mark} the [subsistence and
protection]{.mark} [needs]{.mark}]{.underline}** (decent work, adequate
housing, food, medical and educational services) **[as well as the
affective]{.underline}** ones (living with the family, community, loved
ones, being respected and appreciated) **[[and those relating to
knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}** (understanding), **[cultural identity,
freedom and political participation, creativity, leisure and
spirituality in general [are]{.mark} fully [met]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
However, what I want to highlight in the case of the indigenous people
of the Andean region (Quechua and Aymara) is that these needs are
understood from the point of view of their respective cosmovisions and
under their corresponding terminology in the native languages, so
although 'good living' is a subjective notion not quantifiable or
definable in objective terms, it is clear from its name that the concept
is closely related to human values and needs. **[This explains why it is
appropriate to place it not only in the sphere of the aspirations of the
nation as a whole, but also in the field of human
development]{.underline}**, thus enabling it to acquire the precision
that can be obtained from United Nations Human Development Indices.

A review of the main changes reveals, for instance, that in the
Constitution of Bolivia the concept of "good living" appears in the
preamble, which refers to the fact that **[[the Bolivian state
is]{.mark} based on and [guided by]{.mark} new principles and values,
such as "sovereignty, solidarity and equity]{.underline}** in the
distribution and redistribution of the social product", **[and above all
is based on the "search of living well]{.underline}**". This is one of
several **[[new ethical-moral principles]{.mark},]{.underline}** which
are presented in the Aymara language as sum qamaña, very similar to the
Quechua term of sumac kawsay. With this concept, the purpose is to
**[make the idea of material well-being compatible with both social
peace and support]{.underline}** and mutual solidarity among the people.
Consequently, **[[a person who lives well]{.underline}]{.mark}** (qamiri
sum) **[[is not the one who is rich but the one who
shares]{.mark}:]{.underline}**

The qamiri sum happens to be the one who lives and coexists well,
because he is welcomed by everyone and knows how to welcome and
collaborate with everyone, regardless of whether you have little or
much. In a certain way it can no longer be given individually but only
in and with a larger social group ... Living well turns out to be a kind
of meta-value (to which other more common values must be subordinated,
such as equality, inclusion and social equity). **[Even the educational
system and the new economic model must be guided by the principle of
living well]{.underline}** (Barié 2017: 57).

#### Putting well-being and respect of the environment foster successful movements -- Ecuador proves 

**Padilla '21** \[Luis-Alberto; 2021; president of the board of the
Guatemalan International Relations & Peace Research Institute (IRIPAZ),
member of the International Peace Research Association (IPRA), former
Secretary General of the Latin American Council on Peace Research
(CLAIP), Director of the Diplomatic Academy, Former Vice Minister,
former ambassador in Chile, former permanent representative to the

Political Sciences of the Catholic University Rafael Landivar (URL) of
Guatemala; Sustainable Development in the Anthropocene, "The New
Constitutionalism of Bolivia and Ecuador," Ch. 4.7, p. 188\] SPark

In the new Ecuadorian constitution, good living has different
connotations, Barié points out, although it appears in the context of
the re-founding of the State: "We, the sovereign people of Ecuador
\[...\] decided to build a new form of citizen coexistence, in diversity
and harmony with nature, to achieve good living, sumak kawsay" (Barié
2017: 59). **[[The concept of good living]{.underline}]{.mark}** is also
associated with popular wisdom and the ancestral cosmovision.
Incidentally, sumac kawsay has been part of the historical claims of the
Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) since its
foundation, and **[[has]{.mark} also [been
proposed]{.mark}]{.underline}** by CONAIE **[[as a criticism of capital
accumulation]{.mark} because]{.underline}**, as Barié argues, "**[the
objective and the principles of the economy should not be about
profitability, but human well-being, living well: the sumak kawsay. [The
economy is only a tool]{.mark} at the service of the
community]{.underline}**" (Barié 2017: 61).

For this reason, **[[the]{.mark} Constituent [Assembly proposed]{.mark}
the concept of sumac kawsay as [an ethical principle]{.mark}, [based on
reciprocity and promoted]{.mark}]{.underline}** by indigenous
communities **[so that the '[rights of good living']{.mark} are [located
within economic, social and cultural rights]{.mark}, such as the right
to water, food, education, physical culture, work, social security,
healthy environments and others that support good living]{.underline}**.
It should be noted that the emphasis on good living in the Ecuadorian
Constitution is broader than the Bolivian, since **[it includes two
complete chapters on [inclusion and equity as well as on biodiversity
and natural resources]{.mark}]{.underline}**, both divided into sections
on different topics.

Another aspect of **[the Ecuadorian constitution
highlighted]{.underline}** by Barié is that, following **[criticism of
the predominance of the market typical of neoliberal 'mainstream
economics']{.underline}**, one of the main axes of this concept of good
living is, according to the CONAIE, the creation of a Social and
Solidarity Economy that can to a large extent be compared with the same
concept proposed by the Chilean-American academic Howard Richards, which
I will examine in the next chapter. **[[This system recognizes the human
being as the subject and end of the economy]{.mark}, its main goal being
to guarantee the production and reproduction of the material and
immaterial conditions that make good living possible]{.underline}**
(Barié 2017: 64).

The constitution also establishes different forms of organization of
production, favouring State forms and modalities that "ensure the good
living of the population", including public debt and the environment.
Development is defined as the whole sustainable dynamic of economic,
political, socio-cultural and environmental systems in order to achieve
good living, with the State having the obligation to plan development at
a national level and in a sustainable manner, as well as to organize the
redistribution of resources for access to good living. Consequently,
within **[[the framework of a government that]{.mark}]{.underline}**
promotes development, natural wealth **[[must benefit
people]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including all communities and ethnic
groups, so that they can live in a good manner **[[and simultaneously
respect the right to a healthy environment]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
**[[must be ecologically balanced]{.mark} in order to ensure good
living]{.underline}** (Barié 2017: 60).

'happiness' surveys, and **[focuses on practical alternatives to GDP
growth economics]{.underline}** based on local economies and meaningful
artisanal work. By breaking down the economies of scale, his 'artisanal
revolution' means 'more mechanics, electricians, plumbers, architects,
gardeners, teachers, nurses, therapists, doctors and caregivers, and
fewer bankers, lawyers, CEOs and chartered accountants' (Fioramonti
2017: 220) who service big business and big government.

#### Development [necessitates]{.underline} satisfaction of human needs [before]{.underline} growth 

**Padilla '21** \[Luis-Alberto; 2021; president of the board of the

It has been more than four decades since the United Nations promoted
research that focused on responding to the means to satisfy basic human
needs without transgressing the outer limits of the biosphere, that is,
within the framework of the resolutions of the first United Nations
Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, 1972) that were
published in **[the book Another [Development]{.mark}: Approaches and
Strategies]{.underline}** (Nerfin 1977). In this collective work, papers
on different topics written by authors like Johan Galtung, Marc Nerfin,
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Rodolfo Stavenhagen, Bolívar Lamounier,
Cinthia de Alcántara, Paul Singer, and Sergio Bitar **[[presented an
innovative vision of]{.mark} [development]{.mark} which is [not based on
growth]{.mark} and capitalist modernization]{.underline}**. Since then,
the narrow concept that considered development to be synonymous with
economic growth and industrialization7 is not the generally accepted
paradigm in academia. A good number of Latin American scholars -
including the Norwegian Johan Galtung, who was living in Chile at the
time - were among the pioneers of the new paradigm of sustainable
development. **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** kind of "**[[other
development]{.underline}]{.mark}**" which these Latin American pioneers
were talking **[about is one that must be [orientated towards
satisfying]{.mark}]{.underline}** a more comprehensive conception of
**[human [needs]{.mark}]{.underline}**, i.e. **[one which encompasses
material, economic, social, and cultural and spiritual]{.underline}**
needs, as can be seen in Neef and Elizalde's matrix of needs and
satisfactions reproduced in Table 4.1.

**[This comprehensive [understanding]{.mark} of development [is a matter
of human development and not simply]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[economic
development measured by [GDP]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It began to be used
by the United Nations in the 1990s with the annual publication of human
development reports that introduced social categories such as health,
education and political freedom as parameters for assessing development
in this broad sense. **[This concept of human development is based
on]{.underline}** the ideas in the seminal text **[Development on a
Human Scale]{.underline}**: An Option for the Future, by Neef et al.
(1989), **[which gave continuity to the paradigmatic line of
research]{.underline}** initiated in the previous decade by academics
such as Stavenhagen (1981, 1990, 2013), Cardoso (1969, 2006), Singer
(1980, 2002), Galtung (2003a, 2003b, 2004), and Nerfin (1978), who were
among the authors of the innovative book Towards Another Development:
Approaches and Strategies (1978). Hence, Development of Human Scale
Development was the result of a collective effort that crystallized in a
theoretical systematization of theses that in 1978 outlined only its
more general features. It was designed to give precision and coherence
to such ideas, and to establish the framework for a new approach to the
theory of development that was not reduced to a "mere cosmetic
arrangement of a paradigm in crisis", as the authors of the text say,
but instead was a genuine effort **[to transform and substantially
modify existing thinking]{.underline}** (Neef et al. 1989: 12-13).8

Indeed, in a recent book on sustainable development, the German
researcher **[[Göpel]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[reproduces]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} same [matrix in her criticism of mainstream
economics]{.mark}. To the extent that [it is based on economic
growth]{.mark} and]{.underline}** the individual search for
**[profit]{.underline}**, mainstream **[[economics]{.mark} [can be seen
as responsible for]{.mark} the multiple obstacles and [difficulties
that]{.mark} [s]{.mark}ustainable [d]{.mark}evelopment [has
suffered]{.mark}]{.underline}** in all parts of the world. For Göpel,
**[[a change of mentality and]{.mark} the adoption of [a new holistic
paradigm]{.mark} [that]{.mark} effectively [seeks]{.mark} the full
[satisfaction of human needs]{.mark} in all their complexity [are
indispensable tools]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Not only the most elementary
and **[primary needs such as subsistence, protection and
shelter]{.underline}**, but **[also affection, creativity, freedom,
political participation, leisure, and understanding, must be properly
articulated]{.underline}** within sustainable development processes
(Göpel 2016: 64-65)

From my point of view, this analogy with the tragic Greek Medea myth
equates to a fatalistic philosophical vision that denies human freedom
since - according to Ward - our species is condemned to suffer an
ineluctable destiny. I do not share Ward's determinist vision, although
I admit that the debate opened by his hypothesis is valid, especially
regarding the crisis of the 2020/21 pandemic, because the **[predatory
[behaviour of human beings]{.mark} towards]{.underline}** the **[planet
and]{.underline}** Mother **[Nature]{.underline}** [could]{.mark}
**[[lead to]{.mark} our [extinction]{.mark} [if we don't react]{.mark}
promptly and [adequately]{.mark}]{.underline}** to threats like climate
change and pandemics provoked by malign viruses - the coronavirus is
just one more of a long chain of lethal microbes. This again indicates
that **[[humankind]{.mark} [must]{.mark} embrace a mind[shift by]{.mark}
[disowning neoliberalism]{.mark}, the main culprit of the disarray and
disasters created by an ideological economic doctrine that does not care
about health and life (human security) or the environment and planetary
boundaries (global security).]{.underline}** I outlined in the previous
chapter how, according to social scientist Jared Diamond, some
**[civilizations]{.underline}** (the Mayas in Yucatan and Guatemala)
**[and settlements]{.underline}** (the Norwegians in Greenland, the
Polynesians in Easter Island) **[collapsed]{.underline}** totally
**[after failing to adapt to environmental strains]{.underline}** after
climate change triggered by cultural and collective comportment, while
**[other [civilizations]{.mark} and cultures]{.underline}** (the
Japanese of the Tokugawa dynasty, the natives of the highlands of Papua
New Guinea, the natives of the tiny island of Tikopia in the South
Pacific Ocean) **[[succeeded in avoiding
disastrous]{.underline}]{.mark}** climate **[[change by respecting
nature]{.underline}]{.mark}** (forests and the typical tropical
vegetation) and taking appropriate decisions in time, thanks to the
forethought and wisdom of their respective ruling elites. This
essentially means that I believe in the capacity of humankind to
overcome the challenges of destiny using intelligence, knowledge and
freedom. Thus, if Gaia can conquer Medea our species is not doomed and
hopeless. But I cannot make any predictions; **[[it all depends on our
behaviour from now on.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Many people remember the famous phrase of Pope Paul VI in his Encyclical
Populorum Progressio (1967) 17 about development as "the new name of
peace", but after what has been said on previous pages about the nature
and history of the concept of sustainable development, and its
relationship with both the environmental sciences and the theory of
human needs, including cultural and community development and the
cosmovision of indigenous people, it should be clear that **[sustainable
[peace requires sustainable development]{.mark}, among other reasons
because the type of [peace]{.mark} that goes beyond the absence of war -
positive peace, as Johan Galtung calls it - [requires the satisfaction
of human needs]{.mark} to sustain itself]{.underline}**.18

It is now time to refer to some of the more **[positive
[experiences]{.mark}]{.underline}** that could **[[indicate a change of
paradigm]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[such as]{.underline}** the situation
**[[in Denmark]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[where appropriate policies
made it possible for]{.underline}** local communities to launch
**[numerous renewable energy projects]{.underline}**, **[[and]{.mark}
the most notable case of [Germany]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[which]{.underline}]{.mark}** has **[[exceeded its]{.mark} official
[goal of]{.mark} obtaining]{.underline}** at least **[[45%]{.mark} of
its energy from renewable sources]{.underline}** by 2020. **[[This
change]{.mark} of paradigm]{.underline}** in energy matters
**[[is]{.mark} of such magnitude that a [substantial]{.mark}
[transformation]{.mark} in the thinking of citizens and the private
sector [has]{.mark} already [occurred]{.mark} - a [mind-shift]{.mark}
described by Göpel]{.underline}** (2016: 25) **[which
[demonstrates]{.mark} that [it]{.mark} i[s]{.mark} [feasible]{.mark} [to
change the dominant paradigm in]{.mark} the field of socio-technical
systems]{.underline}** (**[[STS]{.underline}]{.mark}**). **[This turn
means that a multilevel perspective and its incremental [radical
transformations can also]{.mark} [be applied to]{.mark} [other]{.mark}
spheres of human [activities]{.mark}, such as the [environment]{.mark},
[production]{.mark}, [trade]{.mark}, and so on.]{.underline}** This is
not a minor issue, since **[Germany is not just an economic power but
also the most influential country within the European
Union]{.underline}**. **[Despite being highly dependent
on]{.underline}** the importation of **[hydrocarbons]{.underline}**, it
fostered a group of visionary **[entrepreneurs]{.underline}** (who could
met with opposition through the lobbying of conservatives) in order to
promote the ecological niches indispensable for transforming the energy
matrix by **[replaci]{.underline}**ng fossil **[fuels with
renewables]{.underline}**. Göpel describes the process by which a clever
mechanism effectively created a return on investment security that
convinced banks and even risk-averse investors to lend small businesses,
farmers and citizens money to install renewable energy technology,
thereby creating a market for renewable energy even though the sector
had previously been dominated by an oligopoly of powerful companies:

Since these older business models had rendered the transaction costs of
switching to renewable energy solutions prohibitively pricey in the
past, no pioneering movement had been possible. The Renewable Energy Law
hedged the risks of a plethora of new, decentralized energy producers
and unleashed the competitive activity of many small- and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) active in technology development. By the mid-2000s
the tipping point into the acceleration or navigation phase had been
reached, and pioneering activities had become mainstream considerations.
Fossil energy suppliers now felt threatened and tried to fight the
regulation at all levels, e.g., attempting to make the EU declare
feed-in tariffs incompatible with energy market integrations. But the
renewable energy sector grew very quickly, created many jobs in rural
areas with high unemployment and turned Germany into an international
technology leader that inspired other countries. Thus, an environmental
issue had found technology solutions and became solidly economic when it
served the export interests of the German economy and found wide,
bottom-up citizen support. The share of renewable energy in the
electricity mix increased steadily, debunking the strongly spun
narrative that renewable energy systems were technologically
unfeasible - although concerns about black-outs remain. However, **[a
new narrative was established in which]{.underline}** a
**[[transformation]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the energy sector
**[[was]{.underline}]{.mark}** both **[[possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and in progress, drawing in many new participants (Göpel 2016: 25).

In other words, **[the]{.underline}** strategy of a gradual **[[radical
transformation worked]{.underline}]{.mark}**: **[it started
[from]{.mark}]{.underline}** a **[[pre-development phase]{.mark}, moved
towards the take-off phase, and reached a point of maturation (tipping
point) that led [to]{.mark} a third phase of acceleration, until
finally, the socio-technical system]{.underline}** (STS)
**[[stabilized]{.underline}]{.mark}** at a new level. This same process
can be seen in a multi-level perspective, demonstrating that changes can
be promoted from small innovative niches which, once gathered in a
design that brings them together, can take advantage of windows of
opportunity to lead to a new regime that exerts influence on the upper
level of the 'socio-technical landscape'. **[That is the level at which
the ideology, [the 'mindset', and the predominant way of seeing things
in society is located]{.mark} and, despite belonging to an exogenous
context, will react downwards so that the preferences of markets and
consumers are properly articulated within public policies, culture,
industry, science and technology in order to provide feedback through
expectations and social networks to the small innovators who started the
whole process.]{.underline}** Figure 5.3 clearly shows how, starting
from innovative actions at micro level (niches), influence is exerted on
science, public policies, market patterns, social practices and the same
technology at an intermediate level, thereby affecting the higher level,
which is the field of 'meta-narratives' where world-views
('cosmovision') and paradigms are located. This all provides feedback to
terrestrial ecosystems, which benefit from the change in the energy
matrix by completing thecycle and, in the example provided, is
consistent with moving from the predominance of non-renewable energy to
renewable energy.

It is also important to point out that **[[the mind-shift necessary
to]{.mark} promote [s]{.mark}ustainable
[d]{.mark}evelopment]{.underline}** coincides with the ideas of Sachs
(2015), who **[[argues]{.mark} that [reconciling]{.mark} economic
[growth with ecological realities requires]{.mark} a profound
[change]{.mark} of economic model]{.underline}**. It also aligns with
the views of Klein (2015) [and]{.mark} Wolff (2012), who are in favour
of models in which **[local [companies are managed
democratically]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the form of cooperatives or
communal enterprises **[[to produce]{.mark} food, energy, crafts and
goods of all kinds [in a]{.mark} renewed [version of
socialism]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

I would argue that [within the base building movement, there is a move
towards party organizing,]{.underline} but this trend has not always
been explicitly theorized or forwarded within the movement. My goal in
this essay is to argue that [[base building and dual power]{.mark}
strategy can be **[best forwarded through party organizing]{.mark}**,
and that party organizing can [allow]{.mark} this emerging [movement to
solidify into]{.mark} a powerful [revolution]{.mark}ary socialist
tendency in the United States.]{.underline} One of the crucial insights
of the base building movement is that the current state of the left in
the United States is one in which revolution is not currently
possible[.]{.underline} There exists very little popular support for
socialist politics. [A [century of]{.mark} [anticommunist
propaganda]{.mark} has been extremely effective in [convinc]{.mark}ing
even the most oppressed and marginalized that [communism has nothing to
offer]{.mark} them]{.underline}. [The base building emphasis on **[dual
power responds directly]{.mark} to this insight**. By building
institutions which can meet people's needs, we are able to concretely
demonstrate that communists can offer the oppressed relief from the
horrific conditions of capitalism.]{.underline} Base building strategy
recognizes that [actually doing the work to serve the people does
infinitely more to create a socialist base of popular
support]{.underline} than electing democratic socialist candidates or
holding endless political education classes can ever hope to do. Dual
power is about proving that we have something to offer the oppressed.
The question, of course, remains: once we have built a base of popular
support, what do we do next? [If it turns out that [establishing
socialist institutions]{.mark} to meet people's needs does in fact
**[create sympathy towards]{.mark} the cause of [communism]{.mark}**,
how can we mobilize that base?]{.underline} Put simply: [in order to
mobilize the base which base builders hope to create, we need to have
already done the work of building a communist party**.**]{.underline}
[It is not enough to simply meet peoples needs. Rather, we **must build
the institutions of dual power in the name of communism.**]{.underline}
[We must refuse covert front organizing and instead have a public face
as a communist party.]{.underline} When we build tenants unions, serve
the people programs, and other dual power projects, we must make it
clear that we are organizing as communists, unified around a party, and
are not content simply with establishing endless dual power
organizations. [We must be clear that our [strategy is
revolutionary]{.mark} and in order to make this clear we **[must adopt
party organizing]{.mark}**. By "party organizing" I mean an
organizational strategy which adopts the party model.]{.underline} Such
organizing focuses on building a party whose membership is formally
unified around a party line determined by democratic centralist decision
making. [The party model creates [internal methods]{.mark} for
**[holding party members accountable]{.mark}**, unifying party member
action around democratically determined goals, and for educating party
members in communist theory and praxis.]{.underline} A communist
organization utilizing the party model works to build dual power
institutions while simultaneously educating the communities they hope to
serve. [Organizations which [adopt]{.mark} the party model [focus on
propagandizing]{.mark} around the need for [revolutionary
socialism]{.mark}. They function as the forefront of political
organizing, empowering local communities to theorize their liberation
through communist theory while organizing communities to literally fight
for their liberation.]{.underline} A party is not simply a group of
individuals doing work together, but is a formal organization unified in
its fight against capitalism. [Party organizing has much to offer the
base building movement]{.underline}. By working in a unified party, base
builders can ensure that local struggles are tied to and informed by a
unified national and international strategy. While the most horrific
manifestations of capitalism take on particular and unique form at the
local level, we need to remember that [our struggle is against a
material base which functions not only at the national but at the
international level. The formal structures provided by a democratic
centralist party model allow individual locals to have a voice in open
debate, but also allow for a unified strategy to emerge from democratic
consensus. Furthermore, **party organizing allows for local
organizations and individual organizers to be held accountable for their
actions.**]{.underline} [It allows criticism to function not as one
independent group criticizing another independent group, but rather as
comrades with a formal organizational unity working together to sharpen
each others strategies and to help correct chauvinist ideas and
actions.]{.underline} In the context of the socialist movement within
the United States, such [**[accountability is
crucial]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [As a movement which operates within a
settler colonial society, imperialist and colonial ideal frequently
infect leftist organizing. **Creating formal unity and party procedure
for dealing with and correcting these ideas allows us to address these
consistent problems** within American socialist organizing.]{.underline}
Having a formal party which unifies the various dual power projects
being undertaken at the local level also allows for base builders to not
simply meet peoples needs, but to pull them into the membership of the
party as organizers themselves. The party model creates a means for
sustained growth to occur by unifying organizers in a manner that allows
for skills, strategies, and ideas to be shared with newer organizers.
[It also allows community members who have been served by dual power
projects to take an active role in organizing by becoming party members
and participating in the continued growth of base building
strategy]{.underline}. It ensures that there are formal processes for
educating communities in communist theory and praxis, and also enables
them to act and organize in accordance with their own local conditions.
We also must recognize that the current state of the base building
movement precludes the possibility of such a national unified party in
the present moment. Since base building strategy is being undertaken in
a number of already established organizations, it is not likely that
base builders would abandon these organizations in favor of founding a
unified party. Additionally, it would not be strategic to immediately
undertake such complete unification because it would mean abandoning the
organizational contexts in which concrete gains are already being made
and in which growth is currently occurring. What is important for base
builders to focus on in the current moment is building dual power on a
local level alongside building a national movement. This means aspiring
towards the possibility of a unified party, while pursuing continued
local growth. The movement within the Marxist Center network towards
some form of unification is positive step in the right direction. The
independent party emphasis within the Refoundation caucus should also be
recognized as a positive approach. It is important for base builders to
continue to explore the possibility of unification, and to maintain
unification through a party model as a long term goal. In the meantime,
[individual base building organizations ought to adopt party models for
their local organizing. Local organizations ought to be building dual
power alongside recruitment into their organizations, education of
community members in communist theory and praxis,]{.underline} and the
establishment of armed and militant party cadres capable of defending
dual power institutions from state terror. Dual power institutions must
be unified openly and transparently around these organizations in order
for them to operate as more than "red charities." Serving the people
means meeting their material needs while also educating and
propagandizing. It means radicalizing, recruiting, and organizing. [The
[party model remains the most useful method]{.mark} for achieving these
ends.]{.underline} The use of the party model by local organizations
allows base builders to gain popular support, and most importantly, to
mobilize their base of popular support towards revolutionary ends, not
simply towards the construction of a parallel economy which exists as an
end in and of itself. [It is my hope that we will see future unification
of the various local base building organizations into a national
party,]{.underline} but in the meantime we must push for party
organizing at the local level. If local organizations adopt party
organizing, [it ought to become clear that a **[unified national party
will have to be the long term goal]{.mark} of the base building
movement.**]{.underline} Many of the already existing organizations
within the base building movement already operate according to these
principles. I do not mean to suggest otherwise. Rather, my hope is to
suggest that we ought to be explicit about the need for party organizing
and emphasize the relationship between dual power and the party model.
Doing so will make it clear that the base building movement is not
pursuing a cooperative economy alongside capitalism, but is pursuing a
revolutionary socialist strategy capable of fighting capitalism.

**The socialist party is not ready for a revolution. Only dual power

needs]{.underline} of community to face the revolution and [compounding
crises]{.underline} of climate change, imperialism, and fascism.**

Power Approach,\" *Failing That, Invent*,

I previously argued that **[[a crucial advantage to dual power strategy
is that it gives]{.mark} the masses an [infrastructure of socialist
institutions which can]{.mark} directly [provide for material needs in
times of capitalist crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Socialist
agricultural and food distribution programs can take ground that the
capitalist state cedes by simultaneously meeting the needs of the masses
while proving that socialist self-management and political institutions
can function independently of capitalism.]{.underline}**
**[[This]{.mark}]{.underline}** approach is not only **[capable of
literally saving lives in the case of crisis, but of
[demonstrat]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark} possibility of a [revolutionary
project which seeks to destroy]{.mark} rather than reform
[capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[One of the most pressing of the various crises]{.mark} which
humanity faces today [is climate change]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[[Capitalist production]{.mark} has [devastate]{.mark}d [the
planet]{.mark}, and everyday we discover that the small window of time
for avoiding its most disastrous effects is shorter than previously
understood.]{.underline}** The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
predicts that we have twelve years to limit (not even prevent) the more
catastrophic effects of climate change. The simple, and horrific, fact
that **[we all must face is that [climate change has reached a point
where]{.mark} many of its [effects are inevitable]{.mark}, and we are
now in a post-brink world, where damage control is the primary
concern]{.underline}**. **[[The question is]{.mark} not whether we can
escape a future of climate change, but [whether we can survive
it]{.mark}. [Socialist strategy must adapt
accordingly.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

In the face of this crisis, **[the democratic socialists and social
democrats in the United States have largely settled on market-based
reforms]{.underline}**. The Green New Deal, championed by Representative
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the left-wing of the Democratic Party,
remains a thoroughly capitalist solution to a capitalist problem. **[The
proposal does nothing to challenge capitalism itself but rather seeks to
subsidize market solutions to reorient the US energy infrastructure
towards renewable energy production, to develop less energy consuming
transportation, and the development of public investment towards these
ends.]{.underline}**

**[The plan does nothing to call into question the profit incentives and
endless resource consumption of capitalism which led us to this
point]{.underline}**. Rather, it **[seeks to reorient the relentless
market forces of capitalism towards slightly less destructive
technological developments.]{.underline}** While the plan would lead to
a massive investment in the manufacturing and deployment of solar energy
infrastructure, National Geographic reports that "Fabricating \[solar\]
panels requires caustic chemicals such as sodium hydroxide and
hydrofluoric acid, and the process uses water as well as electricity,
the production of which emits greenhouse gases." **[Technology alone
cannot sufficiently combat this crisis, as the production of such
technology through capitalist manufacturing infrastructure only
perpetuates environmental harm]{.underline}**. Furthermore, subsidizing
and incentivizing renewable energy stops far short of actually combating
the fossil fuel industry driving the current climate crisis.

**[The technocratic market solutions offered in the Green New Deal fail
to adequately combat the driving factors of climate
change]{.underline}**. What is worse, **[they rely on a violent
imperialist global system in order to produce their technological
solutions]{.underline}**. **[[The development of high-tech]{.mark}
energy infrastructure and the development of low or zero emission
transportation [requires the import of raw material and rare earth
minerals]{.mark}]{.underline}** which the US can only access because of
the imperial division of the Global South. **[[This imperial
division]{.mark} of the world [requires constant militarism]{.mark} from
the imperial core nations]{.underline}**, and as Lenin demonstrates in
Imperialism: **[The Highest Stage of Capitalism, facilitates constant
warfare as imperial states compete for spheres of influence in order to
facilitate cheap resource extraction.]{.underline}** The US military,
one of many imperialist forces, is the single largest user of petroleum,
and one of its main functions is to ensure oil access for the US.
Without challenging this imperialist division of the world and the role
of the US military in upholding it, **[the Green New Deal fails even
further to challenge the underlying causes of climate
change.]{.underline}**

Even with the failed promises of the Green New Deal itself, it is
unlikely that this tepid market proposal will pass at all. Nancy Pelosi
and other lead Democrats have largely condemned it and consider it
"impractical" and "unfeasible." **[This dismissal is crucial because it
reveals the total inability of capitalism to resolve this
crisis]{.underline}**. If the center-left party in the heart of the
imperial core sees even milquetoast capitalist reforms as a step too
far, we ought to have very little hope that a reformist solution will
present itself within the ever-shrinking twelve-year time frame.

There are times for delicacy and there are times for bluntness, and we
are in the latter. To put things bluntly**[: [the capitalists are not
going to save us]{.mark},]{.underline}** and if we don't find a way to
save ourselves, the collapse of human civilization is a real
possibility. The pressing question we now face is: **[how are we going
to save ourselves?]{.underline}**

Revolution and Dual Power

If capitalism will not be able to resolve the current encroaching
climate crisis, we must find a way to organize outside the confines of
capitalist institutions, towards the end of overthrowing capitalism. If
the Democratic Socialists of America-backed candidates cannot offer real
anti-capitalist solutions through the capitalist state, we should be
skeptical of the possibility for any socialist organization doing so.
The DSA is far larger and far more well-funded than any of the other
socialist organizations in the US, and they have failed to produce
anything more revolutionary than the Green New Deal. We have to abandon
the idea that electoral strategy will be sufficient to resolve the
underlying causes of this crisis within twelve years.

**[While many radicals call for revolution instead of reform, the
reformists often raise the same response: revolution is well and good,
but what are you going to do in the meantime?]{.underline}** In many
ways this question is fair. **[[The socialist left in the US today is
not ready for revolutionary action]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and a mass
base does not exist to back the various organizations which might
undertake such a struggle. Revolutionaries must concede that we have
much work to be done before a revolutionary strategy can be enacted.
This is a harsh truth, but it is true.

**[Much of the left has sought to ignore this truth by embracing
adventurism and violent protest theatrics, in the vain hope of sparking
revolutionary momentum which does not currently exist.]{.underline}** If
this is the core strategy of the socialist left, we will accomplish
nothing in the next twelve years. **[Such approaches are as useless as
the opportunist reforms pushed by the social democrats.]{.underline}**
Our task in these twelve years is not simply to arm ourselves and hope
that magically the masses will wake up prepared for revolution and
willing to put their trust in our small ideological cadres. **[[We
must]{.mark} instead, build a movement, and with it we must [build
infrastructure which can survive revolution]{.mark} [and]{.mark} provide
[a framework for socialist development]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[Dual power is tooled towards this project
best]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The Marxist Center]{.mark} network has
done an impressive amount of work [develop]{.mark}ing [socialist
institutions across the US]{.mark}, largely through tenants organizing
and serve the people programs.]{.underline}** The left wing factions
within the DSA itself have also begun to develop mutual aid programs
that could be useful for dual power strategy. At the same time, mutual
aid is not enough. We cannot simply build these institutions as a reform
to make capitalism more survivable. Rather, **[we [must make these
institutions part of a broader revolutionary movement]{.mark} and they
ought to function as a material prefiguration to a socialist society and
economy]{.underline}**. **[The institutions we build as dual power
outside the capitalist state today ought to be structured towards
revolutionary ends, such that they will someday function as the early
institutions of a revolutionary socialist society.]{.underline}**

To accomplish this goal, we cannot simply declare these institutions to
be revolutionary. Rather they have to be linked together through an
actual revolutionary movement working towards revolutionary ends. This
means that **[dual power institutions cannot exist as ends in and of
themselves, nor can abstract notions of mutual aid cannot be
conceptualized as an end in itself]{.underline}**. **[[The]{.mark}
[explicit purpose of these institutions has to be to radicalize the
masses through meeting their needs]{.mark}, and providing an
infrastructure [for a socialist movement]{.mark} to meet the needs of
its members and the communities in which it operates.]{.underline}**
**[Revolutionary institutions that can provide]{.underline}** food,
housing, and other **[needs for a revolutionary movement will be crucial
for building a base among the masses and for constructing the beginnings
of a socialist infrastructure for when we eventually engage in
revolutionary struggle.]{.underline}**

**[What I want to suggest here is that [the production of food through
dual power]{.mark} institutions should be a central project for this
revolutionary movement]{.underline}**. There are several reasons why I
think this is the case. First, **[food production allows us to meet the
most immanent needs of the masses]{.underline}**. The US is plagued by
food deserts which deprive huge portions of the population access to
fresh food. **[Poverty exacerbates this further, and the devastating
effects of lack of access of healthy food due to poverty are well
documented]{.underline}**. **[This is an urgent need that [socialists
can meet]{.mark} in order [to demonstrate]{.mark} to the masses that it
is socialists who can serve them where [the capitalist state has
failed]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Second, **[[food production is a major
contributor to climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Large-scale meat
production produces massive amounts of greenhouse gas, and the
transportation of food from rule agricultural areas to urban populations
centers is a major contributor as well. Urban agricultural projects and
the development of sustainable permaculture are not sufficient to fix
these problems, as they are not able to overthrow the capitalist system
of agricultural production. However, paired with a broader revolutionary
movement, **[[these projects allow us to]{.mark} undertake scientific
experimentation with meeting food needs, in order to test and
demonstrate the effectiveness of alternative food production methods
that can [eventually replace the current unsustainable capitalist
model]{.mark}]{.underline}**. After all, **[if our revolution cannot
replace unsustainable production models, we will not be able to resolve
climate change any better than the capitalists.]{.underline}**

According to the American scholar Richard Wolff, **[[capitalism and
democracy are in]{.mark} permanent
[contradiction]{.mark}]{.underline}**, given the fact that
**[[corporations]{.mark} and enterprises are ruled by CEOs and managers
who [answer to]{.mark} the owners of [capital]{.mark}, [not]{.mark} to
society and [citizens]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Consequently, **[radical
[reform of the economic system is]{.mark} [needed to democratize the
economic system by creating]{.mark}, for instance, [producers'
cooperatives]{.mark}, or [democratically managed enterprises]{.mark}
that might be an alternative [which generates a new, genuinely socialist
mode of production]{.mark}]{.underline}** which is fully consistent with
the ultimate rationale underlying Marx's theoretical approach in Das
Kapital. Furthermore the proposition that firms should be run by the
workers on their own was endorsed in the past by famous and well-known
liberal thinkers such as John Stuart Mill and John Dewey - one of the
prominent philosophers of the twentieth century - as well as Marxists
like Karl Korsch, Wright Mills and Antonio Gramsci. Besides, the stark
contrast between the innermost driving force behind capitalism and
generally recognized ethical values, such as Christian ethics that extol
virtues such as benevolence and care for our fellow-beings, condemns
greed and discourages the accumulation of wealth, so there is nothing to
be admired in individuals whose actions are solely guided by the
personal profit motive, rather than the duty to take care of their
fellowbeings, i.e. the behaviour of people operating in capitalistic
systems of interpersonal ties does not proceed from democracy, but from
the development of capitalism. Thus **[[the establishment of a new
system]{.mark} founded on solidarity [is an]{.mark} absolute
[necessity]{.mark}, given that [in capitalism]{.mark} "[all]{.mark} the
higher [bonds]{.mark} of love and solidarity [are dissolved]{.mark}:
from the bonds of craftsmen's guilds and social castes to those of
religion and the family]{.underline}**" (Gramsci 1994: 134).
**[[In]{.mark} [a new democratic economic system where]{.mark} a
cooperative or [enterprise is ruled by workers' councils]{.mark},
"[limits are placed on]{.mark} the sway of [capital]{.mark} in the
workplace" [and people gain autonomy and freedom]{.mark} as members of
collectives]{.underline}**. Hence socializing production also involves
humanizing the workplace, making it is possible to say that citizens are
better forged in the factory than in the electoral district. This also
explains why **[it is important to press for the permanent inclusion of
workers in the strategies and bargaining agendas of all trade
unions]{.underline}**. Furthermore, if the supreme value of life is not
to have but to be, being oneself and enjoying life will be facilitated
by a socialist order founded on being, rather than having, and this will
be the result of the active involvement of workers in economic life as
free citizens.

Calamity has already struck for many among the poorer populations,
whether from floods, droughts, heatwaves, or food shortages. Shortages
and droughts provoke internal violent conflict - as in the Middle East -
which in turn generates further scarcity alongside the violence,
triggering massive migratory flows that then strain the resource-base in
other countries, like Turkey and several European countries. The
dialectic of scarcity feeds and is fed by terrorism and military
intervention in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Palestine and
Yemen, and the consequences are terrorist attacks against civilians in
both Muslim and predominantly non-Muslim countries. In the last two

## Redistribution of Wealth

### 1NC \-- Alt \-- Redistribution of Wealth

#### Redistribution of wealth is key

**Padilla '21** \[Luis-Alberto; 2021; president of the board of the
Guatemalan International Relations & Peace Research Institute (IRIPAZ),
member of the International Peace Research Association (IPRA), former
Secretary General of the Latin American Council on Peace Research
(CLAIP), Director of the Diplomatic Academy, Former Vice Minister,

Political Sciences of the Catholic University Rafael Landivar (URL) of
Guatemala; Sustainable Development in the Anthropocene, "Thomas
Picketty," Ch. 5.3.2, p. 229-231\] SPark

Indeed, **[Piketty argues that the [concentration of wealth]{.mark} in
these rentier elites of owners of capital [has]{.mark} in turn [led to
an exaggerated increase in]{.mark} social [inequalities]{.mark}, a
phenomenon [that is undermining and threatening]{.mark}
[democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}** itself among the member countries of
the European Union. Given that the structure of social inequality is the
central problem of twenty-first-century capitalism, Piketty dedicates
his book to the study of it in several special chapters which deal with
issues such as inequality and the concentration of wealth; the
inequality of income at work; inequality in the ownership of capital;
merit and inheritance in the long term; and inequality on a global
scale.

According to Piketty, the market economy based on private property needs
to be regulated by the State, otherwise, without rules and a legal
order, very much in Habermas' analytical line, "**[powerful forces of
divergence ... threaten democratic societies and the social justice
values on which they are based]{.underline}**" (Piketty 2014: 571).
Piketty also emphasizes the fact that the main destabilizing force of
capitalism is that the private rate of capital gains can be considerably
higher than the income growth of wage earners, small and medium
entrepreneurs and the rest of society. This means that wealth
accumulated in the past grows faster than production and wages. Such
inequality therefore expresses "a fundamental logical contradiction",
which inevitably leads the owners of capital to become rentiers with
increasing dominance over those who rely on employment or their
workforce. This is how a situation that favours luxury consumption and
small market niches of luxury goods and services for these elites is
generated, to the detriment of productive investment and employment.

The fact is that once capital works, it reproduces much faster than
production, and the consequences in the long term lead to a brutal
concentration of wealth so that on a global scale the problem becomes
enormous and without simple solutions. During the twentieth century, two
World Wars were necessary to reduce the excessive profits of capital,
somewhat creating the illusion that the fundamental structural
contradiction of capitalism had been overcome. With the current average
of profits (4-5%) wars will hopefully not become the central phenomenon
of the twenty-first century, as they were during the twentieth century
(Piketty 2013: 572). Consequently, for wealth not to continue
concentrating excessively, **[[Piketty proposes]{.mark} creating [an
annual]{.mark} [tax on capital]{.mark} in order [to stop]{.mark} this
"spiral of infinite inequality". The [rates]{.mark} suggested by Piketty
[are]{.mark} in the order of 0[.1-0.5% for fortunes under 1
million]{.mark} [Euros]{.mark}; [1% for capital of between 1 and 5
million]{.mark} Euros; [2% for the scale of 5-10 million]{.mark} and
[between 5 and 10% for fortunes of between several hundred]{.mark} and
several [thousand million]{.mark} Euros:]{.underline}**

**[[This would stop]{.mark} the [unlimited growth of inequality]{.mark}
in the distribution of global wealth [that is expanding at a rate that
cannot be sustained]{.mark} in the long term, and that should worry even
the most fervent self-regulated market champions. [Historical experience
also shows]{.mark} that these [immense inequalities]{.mark} in \[the
distribution of\] wealth have very little to do with entrepreneurship
and [are not useful]{.mark} for promoting growth]{.underline}** ... The
difficulty is that this solution, a progressive tax on capital, requires
a high level of international cooperation and regional political
integration. It is not within the reach of nation-states where social
commitments are negotiated. Many worry that moving in the direction of
greater cooperation and political integration, as seen within the
European Union, only subverts the achievements already made ... Although
the risk is real, I do not see any genuine alternative: if we are to
recover the control over capitalism we have to bet everything on
democracy - and in Europe, democracy on a European scale. Larger
political communities such as the United States and China may have a
broader range of options, but for small European countries, which will
soon appear smaller in relation to the global economy, retreating to
national borders can only lead to worse frustrations and dislikes than
those that already exist. The nation-state is still the appropriate
level to modernize any number of social and fiscal policies and develop
new forms of governance as well as shared ownership between public and
private, which is one of the greatest challenges for the remainder of
the century. But only regional political integration can lead to an
effective regulation of the globalized patrimonial capitalism of the
twenty-first century (Piketty 2013: 572-573).

The previous lines were written by Piketty in 2013, the year of the
first edition of his book in French. It is worrisome that since then the
situation has worsened with the unfortunate vote for Brexit by British
people exasperated by EU regulations; Trump's election by disenchanted
American unemployed workers; the huge flow of refugees resulting from
the wars in the Middle East, especially Syria; terrorism menacing
European cities; the racism and xenophobia that these last phenomena
have aroused throughout Europe; and, of course, the COVID-19 pandemic in
2020/21. To all this should be added the populist neo-nationalism in
spite of Biden's election, the damage caused by former. Trump
administration, unchaining a new cold war against China, threatening
Iran, Venezuela and North Korea, intimidating Mexico and the Latin
American countries with his racism and xenophobia, distancing the US
from its EU and NATO allies, and so on. Thus the picture could not be
grimmer now in relation to the scenarios outlined by Piketty in the
conclusions of his book. In any case, it is clear that **[there is no
way out other than betting on democracy and the reform of capitalism at
macro-economic level]{.underline}**. At least in the European case, it
is from their own institutions that Brussels must make appropriate
decisions - such as the circular economy and the European Green Deal -
to impose effective regulations on this "globalized patrimonial
capitalism" which characterize these early decades of the twenty-first
century.

In any case, the prospect of new concord in the European leadership and
the possible reconstitution of the Paris-Berlin axis looms on the
horizon thanks to the crisis provoked by the pandemic. Thus in a recent
interview **[Piketty]{.underline}** (2020) **[stated that [it is]{.mark}
now [necessary]{.mark} [to change the economic system]{.mark} because
even though, after the fall of communism, changing the system was no
longer fashionable, the pandemic has again put this issue on the agenda.
It is clear that [a different economic system is absolutely
necessary]{.mark} if the EU really wants [to solve both the social
inequality crisis and the climate change threat]{.mark} produced
by]{.underline}** what Piketty calls '**[hyper-capitalism'. He is in
favour of a [participatory socialist system]{.mark} [based on reforms
such as sharing power]{.mark} with workers within big corporations and
enterprises in order to [give workers the right to vote on
strategies]{.mark}; [the establishment of a basic income]{.mark}; [and
the "permanent circulation" of wealth]{.mark} through fiscal reform,
including [a progressive tax on patrimony and
heritage]{.mark}]{.underline}** in order to change the current situation
where in France and Italy, for instance, 50% of the population owns just
5% of the real estate, financial and professional assets whereas the
richest 10% in those countries own 50% of the assets and another 1% owns
25% of the wealth.

#### The redistribution of wealth solves for inequality and other neoliberal crises

In summary, **[Richards's Economy of Social Solidarity]{.underline}**
(**[ESS]{.underline}**) coincides not just with views like those of
Sousa Santos but also **[has parallels with technical and sophisticated
macro-economic approaches, such as those of Varoufakis about the
surpluses recycling mechanism that constitutes his key criterion to
determine whether capitalism could be reformed. In the same manner that
[global-scale capitalism should be reformed to diminish inequality by
sharing surpluses among the poor and establishing]{.mark}, for instance,
[a global tax on financial transactions]{.mark} (FTT) [to finance the
universal basic income]{.mark} advocated by Varoufakis, the ESS model
deems that [surplus recycling must take place at a]{.mark} local and
[community lev]{.mark}el]{.underline}**. This is because it is in this
physical location that economic surplus can be shared instead of
accumulated for personal enrichment. Individuals **[[who hoard their
surplus cease to be responsible members]{.mark} of the community - or
society - becoming rentiers, [as Piketty]{.mark} similarly [says]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} his [critical]{.mark} historical [analysis of the huge
concentration of wealth and inequalities of]{.mark} twenty-first-century
[capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Richards's views could also be
compared with those of Morin (2011), who, in an interesting book about
'humankind policies', refers to the cooperative movement, micro loans,
fair trade, demography, indigenous peoples, water, and environmental
experiences in different countries, including France (Morin 2011).

#### The redistribution of wealth is key to stability

So if banks are the new rulers of the capitalist system and have
governmental support as a result of the neoliberal policies launched by
Reagan and Thatcher in the 1980s, the collapse of the welfare state is
perfectly explicable. Varoufakis argues that the welfare state
'civilized' and 'stabilized' capitalism in those years, so the
**[neoliberal wild [capitalism]{.mark} prevailing again in current times
must once [more]{.mark} [be]{.mark} [put]{.mark} [under]{.mark} state
[control]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[especially if the working class is
no]{.mark} [longer socially insured and]{.mark} [their wages
stagnated]{.mark}]{.underline}** since the introduction of the so-called
'Washington Consensus'. Consequently, **[to solve the current
crisis]{.underline}** (aggravated by the pandemic of 2020/21) **[[the
neoliberal narrative]{.mark} that maintains that wealth is created by
the private sector [must be discarded]{.mark}]{.underline}** because, in
fact, **[[wealth is created by society]{.underline}]{.mark}** (taxpayers
who finance research and development) **[[and appropriated by the owners
of capital]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is demonstrated by simple facts:
the **[internet is the result of research financed by the state but was
appropriated by [Google]{.mark} or Microsoft]{.underline}**, the
**[components of cellular phones and computers are also the result of
state-financed research appropriated by [Apple]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
the **[vaccines developed with public funding are appropriated by
[pharmaceutical corporations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and so on. Hence,
Varoufakis affirms that **[[the best way to stabilize]{.mark} and
'civilize' [the system]{.mark} again [would be]{.mark} the establishment
of [a universal basic income]{.mark} that could [also]{.mark}
[help]{.mark} to [solve]{.mark} the problem of the huge
[unemployment]{.mark} [created by the pandemic]{.mark} crisis
[and]{.mark} [prevent]{.mark} the same problem in the foreseeable
future, when [joblessness]{.mark} will increase [due to
automatization]{.mark} and robotization]{.underline}**. Thus the need
for a social safety net is not just a matter of social justice but of
keeping the economy afloat by subsidizing demand.

## Cosmopolitics

Epilogue, p. 361-362\] SPark

Not surprisingly, the democratization and legitimization of the
international system require a new kind of multilateralism, **[a true
[cosmopolitan vision]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[could [prevent and
reduce]{.mark} the danger of internal [ethnic cleansing]{.mark} and
interstate [warfare]{.mark} and [violence]{.mark}, [especially in
the]{.mark} 'flash-points' of [Eurasia]{.mark}, the [South]{.mark} and
[East]{.mark} [China]{.mark} [Seas]{.mark}, the [Middle East]{.mark},
and even [Latin America]{.mark}]{.underline}**, where geopolitics still
confronts the trend towards regional integration. As previously stated,
geopolitics and the territorial principle must be transformed. The
contemporary concept of global security based on the preservation of
planetary boundaries must be adopted, and **[the absence of sustainable
development must be regarded]{.underline}** **[as a threat to peace
ecology]{.underline}** because climate change is caused by the
accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Last but not least,
**[positive peace based on the [eradication of structural
violence]{.mark} is also fundamental]{.underline}**. In synthesis, in
today's world, **[[sustainable]{.mark} [development]{.mark} [must be the
answer to]{.mark} the multiple [socio-economic]{.mark},
[environmental]{.mark} [and political crises that are]{.mark}
[threatening]{.mark} the survival of [our]{.mark} own
[species]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Thus, if the anthropogenic
deterioration of climate is aggravated by the ecological threats linked
to the Great Acceleration, urgent measures must be taken - the COP 21
commitments as a minimum - to stop an existential danger that could
include humanity in the sixth mass extinction. **[[Cosmopolitics]{.mark}
is not a utopia that would never become reality]{.underline}**. When a
person acknowledges the reality of a situation, **[the social
consequences of this perception [can be transformed in
reality]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Thus, **[[despite]{.mark} the fact that
[our]{.mark} [contemporary world]{.mark} is still mainly Westphalian and
neoliberal]{.underline}** and that, unfortunately, neo-nationalism is
reappearing, at the same time globalization and **[trans-nationalization
have already introduced important changes in global civil
society]{.underline}**. If we want to avoid the collapse of
civilization, sustainable development complemented with a substantial
reform of capitalism, a return to the 362 Epilogue welfare state, the
regulation of markets, imposing taxes on the super-rich, establishing a
universal basic income, allowing everybody to enjoy a decent standard of
living based on Buen Vivir (good living) - not personal gain - and the
non-material dimensions of fulfilment such as meditation and
spirituality, the quality of life, social solidarity, the preservation
of ecosystems, and the protection of the environment are all fundamental
issues. Then it will just be a matter of time before we attain the
collective change of mentality and philosophy that will lead the
majority of world citizens to redefine reality according to the new
holistic and cosmopolitan paradigm with all its anticipated factual and
social consequences. Nevertheless, engaging in these topics at world
level requires a reassessment of how ethics, international relations,
economics, sociology, natural sciences and ecology can work together
towards sustainability, **[[using
cosmopolitanism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, holism **[and
transdisciplinarity as methodological tools that [will help]{.mark} to
[overcome]{.mark} the current world crisis. Escaping [extinction by
embracing sustainability]{.mark} - that is the great challenge of our
century.]{.underline}**

#### The alt is critical NOW - current trends in globalization reiterate Capitalist ideals of "winners and losers", causing unjustified norms in international order

**Padilla '21** \[Luis-Alberto; 2021; president of the board of the

Political Sciences of the Catholic University Rafael Landivar (URL) of
Guatemala; Sustainable Development in the Anthropocene, "The
Cosmopolitan Approach of Ulrich Beck," Ch. 6.2, p. 290-291\] SPark

What are these cosmopolitan **[[realities]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
intrude and **[[demand a new cosmopolitan methodology]{.mark} capable of
preventing]{.underline}** social sciences "becoming a museum of
antiquated ideas", to quote Beck? First of all, national state borders
have become porous, interdependences are growing exponentially, and
restrictive immigration policies are trapped in
**[contradictions]{.underline}**: on the one hand the **[[rich
industrialized countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the Global North
[are]{.mark} **[[suffering]{.mark} a "spectacular demographic
[regression]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with ageing populations that
threaten to overwhelm pensions and health systems" **[[and
reinforce]{.underline}]{.mark}** political conservatism - like the
**[growing neonationalism and [populism]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the
European extreme right and the former Trump administration - and **[[on
the other hand these]{.mark} very [countries are busy "building ramparts
to ward off]{.mark}]{.underline}** both the feared and the real
immigration flows from **[[the]{.mark} [poor]{.mark}er
South]{.underline}**". Indeed, as social, economic and political
interdependences are growing worldwide, leading to new forms of
migration (of both migrant workers and refugees escaping from war and
armed conflicts) these circumstances condemn anti-migratory policies as
counterproductive and unable to stop human mobility, as happened in the
aftermath of terrorist attacks of September 11, because "it is precisely
this repressive impulse that undermines the necessary readiness to
authorize more immigration, which could counter falling demographic
curves and rejuvenate the population" (Beck 2003: 53). Interestingly,
that lucid forecast about the ills of "methodological nationalism" was
made by Beck in 2003! Another "cosmopolitan reality" is that certain
**[cosmopolitan issues, such as [human rights]{.mark}, [have]{.mark}
[been]{.mark} [internalized]{.mark} in nation states.]{.underline}**
**[[As these standards become part of the universal]{.mark} jus cogens
widely accepted as enforceable international
[law]{.mark}]{.underline}** - regardless of whether or not its main
instruments have been duly subscribed to and ratified by member
states2 - the judges and courts of all UN member **[[states]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} [obligated to accept and apply]{.mark} these
norms]{.underline}** whether dealing with nationals and foreigners. In
other words, to quote Beck (2003: 53), "Human rights are increasingly
detached from citizenship status and are no longer bound by national
contexts," and "**[[examples]{.mark} of this trend]{.underline}**"
**[[can]{.mark} similarly [be seen in]{.mark}]{.underline}** educational
**[curricula]{.underline}**; the growing number of bi-national marriages
and families; the increasing number of transnational work and private
life connections; the growing mobility of communication, information,
cash flows and risks (such as the pandemic and climate change
catastrophes, products, services, and so on); trade agreements; diaspora
cultures (the 're-ethnification' or recuperation of ethnic identity,
religion, culture and national customs revived in the daily life of
people living in guest countries); and what **[Beck calls the
"[internationalization]{.mark} of national [models of
inequality]{.mark}". [To put it another way]{.mark}, the permeability of
national boundaries entails a distribution of [globalization winners and
losers]{.mark}]{.underline}** (according to the production sectors that
are either shielded from the world market or exposed to it) in such a
way that in some situations this can produce a contradiction between
national and transnational elites "who fight over positions and
resources within national power spaces" (Beck 2003: 64).

On these pages I have presented the idea that **[the
Anthropocene]{.underline}** is not just a new geological epoch that
replaces the Holocene but **[must]{.underline}** additionally **[be
understood as a normative cultural model based on [the]{.mark}
transdisciplinary holistic and [cosmopolitan
paradigm]{.mark}]{.underline}** that unifies social and cultural
sciences. Regarding the latter, my main goal is to make a contribution
to academic understanding about ways to mitigate the Great Acceleration
of GHG emissions endangering the survival of our species due to climate
change threats, **[which [are]{.mark} also [closely related to]{.mark}
the [prevailing neoliberal economic model that]{.mark} [misguidedly
puts]{.mark} the accumulation of [capital and]{.mark} economic [growth
over human needs]{.mark} [and respect for]{.mark} natural
[ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}** as the most important purpose of
production and even of human individual lives. This is why I argue that
**[[the]{.mark} crucial [alternative]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[in the
face of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the global pandemic (aggravated by the
dismantling of welfare and health systems in **[countries under the
influence of [neoliberalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as the US and
some European and Latin American countries) and the threats of climate
change **[[is to abandon]{.mark} the pernicious [worshipping of
'markets' or face]{.mark} the sixth mass
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}** that science is foreseeing unless we
change the predominant neoliberal mindset and prevailing economic
policies. Evidently, everybody must realize that **[[the way out]{.mark}
of the crisis [can]{.mark}no[t]{.mark} [be found in]{.mark} a national
manner with [isolated]{.mark} national [policies]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Something we have learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that
**[[international]{.mark} [cooperation is vital]{.mark}]{.underline}**;
developing vaccines and avoiding the increase in contagions and deaths
would have been impossible if all countries of the world had not
collaborated and shared knowledge, information, medical equipment and
all kind of resources, including financial means.1 This is where the
transnational cosmopolitan paradigm that I will be discussing on the
following pages enters the scene, because a change in mindset from the
conventional nationally or ethnically centred mentality to a
world-centric cosmopolitan way of thinking is absolutely necessary.
**[This [change]{.mark} in the theoretical approach of social sciences
[from]{.mark} methodological [nationalism to]{.mark} a [cosmopolitan
focus is fundamental]{.mark}]{.underline}** because, as Beck argues, the
cosmopolitan critique is not about nation-state sovereignty or why it
has been subordinated to the forces of globalization, but about the
power potentials, strategies and organizational forms of politics
without borders ('de-bounded') which allow new actors (and networks of
actors) from global civil society to influence the world scenario

From this perspective, **[[globalization]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as we
have seen on previous pages, **[is a phenomenon that [has been
inherent]{.mark} in the world system]{.underline}** since the sixteenth
century. **[[Nowadays it is]{.mark} [better]{.mark} [understood]{.mark}
[from]{.mark} the perspective of its current manifestations, which are
the result of the impressive scientific and technological developments
exemplified by the [new information and communication]{.mark}
technologies]{.underline}** (ICTs) of the so called information era
examined above. **[On a social level [there is now]{.mark} a
[transnational]{.mark} [civil]{.mark} [society]{.mark} [that]{.mark}, as
a positive result of globalization, has [facilitated]{.mark} [the
emergence of]{.mark} significant nuclei of [a new type of
citizenship]{.mark} (people with a world centric mentality or
post-conventional cosmopolitan world consciousness) [that]{.mark}
rejects ethnocentric nationalism and [constitutes]{.mark} the basis of
the [new]{.mark} transnational social [movements that promote

defend]{.mark} causes such as [ecology]{.mark}, gender

rights, humanitarian [law]{.mark}, [sustainable development]{.mark}, the
UN 2030 Agenda, the commitments of the Paris COP 21, [nuclear

therefore possible to say that [this cosmopolitan world-view]{.mark} and
its social movements show that a significant layer of global civil
society [is emerging with]{.mark} a post-conventional cosmopolitan
philosophy or world-view that could also be [the bedrock]{.mark} or
underpinning [for]{.mark} the kind of [transnational citizenship]{.mark}
pioneered by the EU]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, **[there are some
[negative expressions]{.mark} of globalization]{.underline}**, such as
the **[proliferation of organized crime and other
phenomena]{.underline}** that **[[can be attributed to]{.mark} the
characteristics of [the capitalist system]{.mark}]{.underline}**, like
the **[growing number of transnational companies whose production is
destined for the global market]{.underline}** and requires
intergovernmental agreements in order to permit merchandise to circulate
freely (with reduced or no customs tariffs) or facilitate investments so
that corporations may 'relocate' to places where wages are lower, in
areas where the **[use of corrupt procedures is frequent with the
purpose of obtaining government contracts which enable the accumulation
of capital, the concentration of wealth, and the placing of funds in tax
havens]{.underline}**: all those negative features can be mitigated by
appropriate global regulations negotiated in multilateral UN
international fora.

#### AT - Cosmopolitics impossible - no social integration

Unfortunately and in contrast, other regions of the world like Latin
America have not yet succeeded in gaining the impetus for a social
integration process comparable to the EU. Indeed, MERCOSUR, the Andean
Pact and the Central American Integration System (SICA) have all failed
to establish supranational institutions, so those initiatives consist of
regionalization and multilateral cooperation, not integration.
**[However, [the]{.mark} [absence of social integration does]{.mark}
[n]{.mark}o[t]{.mark} [mean]{.mark} that discussions concerning
[transnational]{.mark} [citizenship]{.mark} [are]{.mark} [not]{.mark}
[possible]{.mark} in the context of regionalization]{.underline}**,
because the **[[interconnectedness]{.mark} brought about by
the]{.underline}** internet and smartphones in this **[information

the creation of [links]{.mark} and networks [between]{.mark} all kind of
[actors,]{.mark} including individuals and social movements involving

For that reason **[[it is indisputable that]{.mark} not just a regional
but [a global civil society exists]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as pointed
out at the beginning of this century by Kaldor et al. (2003). In Global
Civil Society they refer to the concept as 'normative' but also as a
useful way to describe what was then considered an emerging new social
reality as a result of the connectivity of global civic action as a
counterweight to the narrow notion relating globalization to strictly
economic phenomena (Kaldor et al. 2003: 3-4).

So **[how do]{.underline}**es Gramsci say **[we can escape hegemonic
rule]{.underline}**? As a political economist he of course refers to
structural problems within the production processes. Resource
constraints or too high levels of inequality might challenge their
smooth continuation and therefore the acceptance of the division of
labor and revenues within them. But, most relevant for this book, he
also suggests **[the weakening of the cultural and ideational consensus
or dominant paradigm that helps to justify the unequal distribution
patterns and provide moral hazard on a sociocultural]{.underline}**
rather than structural **[level]{.underline}**.

**[Public discourse after the financial crisis]{.underline}**, at least

**[that human nature is simply greedy]{.underline}** and that it was not

articles suggest how it might be possible to find laws without loopholes
for globalized systems.]{.underline}** The moral hazard discussion so
far points out that systems too big to fail and contracts with golden
parachutes are not very conducive to good governance.

But **[[there is]{.mark} also [a]{.mark} sociocultural moral [hazard
perpetuated by a narrative]{.mark}]{.underline}** and proclaimed common
sense **[[in which people are innately greedy]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[[The ethical default changes from]{.mark} one of '[intending no harm'
to]{.mark} one of '[do everything that is not explicitly forbidden
because this is legitimate]{.mark}]{.underline}**.' Even regulatory and
judicial consequences will differ from those of a society in which
egoistical behavior to the detriment of the great majority is considered
an individual and civilizational failure. Different sentences for
corruption or rape in different cultural settings are just one example
of this hazard effect.

German philosopher Richard David Precht offers a forthright view on the
effects of the widespread adoption of mainstream economic ideas and the
commodification of human relationships: "Strict and tough calculation of
utility, **[[ruthlessness and greed are not man's main driving forces,
but the result of]{.mark} targeted breeding]{.underline}**. One could
call this process '**[the origin of egoism by [capitalist
selection']{.mark}]{.underline}**, following Charles Darwin's famous
principal work" (ibid., here cited by Habermann 2012: 15).

More subtly, Gill writes: "**[a change in thinking is a change in the
social totality and thus has an impact on other social processes; a
change in the social totality will provoke change in the process of
thought]{.underline}**. Hence the process of thinking is part of a
ceaseless dialectic of social being" (Gill 2003: 22). This means that
many of **[[the ultimate drivers of societal change are located within
each one of us]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Here, as indicated in purple and
blue arrows in Fig. 2.6, we find the connection between the big picture
of meta-level paradigms and hegemonic narratives on the meso-level and
the mini-level of individual thinking and acting: **[[everyone can
challenge the]{.mark} declared [system]{.mark}-purpose]{.underline}**
and **[the ideas [and assumptions it needs to appear]{.mark} as
beneficial or [legitimate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[By questioning the
standard answers]{.mark} and ways of doing things [we can drive change
from below, within and above,]{.mark} at the same time.]{.underline}**

#### The alternative is seeing capitalism for what it truly is

geographer, PhD, Alice Hamilton Prize, **[Transcending the metabolic
rift: a theory of crises in the capitalist world-ecology,]{.underline}**

This sort of social determinism was indeed where I began (Moore
[2000a](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2010.538579)).
N**[early a decade ago, I argued that 'environmental crises' and long
'systemic cycles' of environmental transformation complemented
[capitalism\'s]{.mark} phases of development.]{.underline}** It was
clear, for instance, that the rise of monopoly capitalism in the later
nineteenth century entailed a set of far-reaching agroecological
transformations, from the wheatfields of the American Midwest to the
copper mines of Chile and the rubber plantations of southeast Asia. I
soon found that one could travel only so far with such a model. **[It
was an approach that proceeded from a set of a priori constructions
ontologically prior to the relations I wanted to discern: the game was
[rigged, the outcome determined in advance]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
rise of monopoly **[[cap]{.mark}italism, in this scheme of things,
[caused changes in 'the' environment]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But such a
view begs an important question. To wit, How does the nature--society
relation ask for a rethinking of capitalism and its phases of
development? Perhaps even more important: **[What can a socio-ecological
method reveal about capitalism that was previously underappreciated or
mis-recognized?]{.underline}** This was a much more intriguing line of
questioning. I appreciated the flood of critical scholarship that
accounted for capitalism\'s environmental depredations, but after a
certain point, I wasn\'t learning anything that most of us didn\'t
already know: **[[Cap]{.mark}italism [is bad news for]{.mark} [the
birds]{.mark} and [bees]{.mark}, the [water]{.mark}, the [soil]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} pretty much [all living creatures]{.mark} on the
planet.]{.underline}** Empirical evidence might be amassed to verify
this or that 'environmental' impact, but within the limits of the
Cartesian scheme, **[[the socio-ecological constitution]{.mark} of
capitalism itself [remains unexplored]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is not
that we don\'t need an analysis of impacts. Rather, the problem is that
Cartesianism narrows, rather than expands, the kinds of impacts under
investigation -- **[[farming is important]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} so are
[CO2 emissions,]{.mark} [but]{.mark} [not global finance]{.mark} and its
mania for securitization, [or the Washington Consensus, or the dollar as
world currency]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In an expansive sense, the big
question turns on how we think capitalism, or if you prefer, modernity,
industrialization, imperialism, and the many other possible 'master
processes' (Tilly
[1984](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2010.538579))
of world-historical change. **[[The alternative is between differing
'ways of seeing']{.mark}-- between, say, a capitalism (or modernity, or
industrial society) that acts upon nature, and one that develops through
human and extra-human natures.]{.underline}** **[[We have]{.mark}, I
believe, [arrived at a powerful eductive moment]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[-- one that allows us to erase old boundaries and open new
vistas]{.underline}**, and one where we can reconstitute each of these
processes on the historical basis of the nature--society
relation.[3](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2010.538579)

[[Indications of]{.mark} this [failure of capitalism]{.mark} are
**[everywhere]{.mark}**. [Stagnation of investment]{.mark} punctuated by
[bubbles of financial expansion]{.mark}, which then inevitably
burst]{.underline}, now characterizes the so-called free market.4
[**[Soaring inequality]{.mark} in income and wealth** has its
counterpart in the declining material circumstances of a majority of the
population]{.underline}. Real [[wages]{.mark} for most workers in the
United States have [barely budge]{.mark}d in forty years]{.underline}
despite steadily rising productivity.5 [Work intensity has increased,
while work and safety protections on the job have been systematically
jettisoned]{.underline}. Unemployment data has become more and more
meaningless due to a new institutionalized underemployment in the form
of contract labor in the gig economy.6 Unions have been reduced to mere
shadows of their former glory as capitalism has asserted totalitarian
control over workplaces. With the demise of Soviet-type societies,
social democracy in Europe has perished in the new atmosphere of
"liberated capitalism."7

The capture of the [**[surplus]{.mark} value [produced by]{.mark}
over[exploited populations]{.mark} in the poorest regions** of the
world]{.underline}, via the global labor arbitrage instituted by
multinational corporations, is leading to an [unprecedented amassing of
financial wealth at the center of the world economy and relative poverty
in the periphery]{.underline}.8 Around \$21 trillion of offshore funds
are currently lodged in tax havens on islands mostly in the Caribbean,
constituting "the fortified refuge of Big Finance."9 Technologically
driven monopolies resulting from the global-communications revolution,
together with the rise to dominance of Wall Street-based financial
capital geared to speculative asset creation, have further contributed
to the riches of today's "1 percent." [Forty-two billionaires now enjoy
as much wealth as half the world's population]{.underline}, while the
three richest men in the United States---Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and
Warren Buffett---have more wealth than half the U.S. population.10 In
every region of the world, inequality has increased sharply in recent
decades.11 [The [gap in]{.mark} per capita [income]{.mark} and wealth
between the richest and poorest nations]{.underline}, which has been the
dominant trend for centuries, [is **[rapidly widening]{.mark} once
again**.]{.underline}12 [More than 60 percent of the world's employed
population, some two billion people, now work in the impoverished
informal sector, forming a massive global proletariat]{.underline}. The
global reserve army of labor is some 70 percent larger than the active
labor army of formally employed workers.13

[[Adequate **health care**, **housing**]{.mark}, **education**,
[and]{.mark} clean **[water]{.mark}** and **air** are **[increasingly
out of reach]{.mark}** for large sections of the
population,]{.underline} even in wealthy countries in North America and
Europe, while [transportation is becoming more difficult in the United
States and many other countries]{.underline} due to irrationally high
levels of dependency on the automobile and disinvestment in public
transportation. [Urban structures are more and more characterized by
gentrification and segregation, with cities becoming the playthings of
the well-to-do while marginalized populations are shunted
aside]{.underline}. About [[half a million]{.mark} people, most of them
children, are [homeless]{.mark} on any given night [in the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates.14 New York
City is experiencing a major rat infestation, attributed to warming
temperatures, mirroring trends around the world.15

[In the United States and other high-income countries, **[life
expectancy]{.mark} is [in decline]{.mark}**, with a remarkable
resurgence of Victorian illnesses related to poverty and
exploitation]{.underline}. In Britain, gout, scarlet fever, whooping
cough, and even scurvy are now resurgent, along with tuberculosis. [With
[inadequate enforcement of work health and safety]{.mark}
[regulations]{.mark}, black lung disease has returned with a vengeance
in U.S. coal country.]{.underline}16 [Overuse of antibiotics,
particularly by capitalist agribusiness, is leading to an
antibiotic-resistance crisis, with the dangerous growth of
superbugs]{.underline} generating increasing numbers of deaths, which by
mid--century could surpass annual cancer deaths, prompting the World
Health Organization to declare a "**[[global health
emergency]{.underline}]{.mark}**."17 [These dire conditions, arising
from the workings of the system, are [consistent with]{.mark} what
Frederick Engels, in the Condition of the Working Class in England,
called "**[social murder]{.mark}**]{.underline}."18

At the instigation of giant corporations, philanthrocapitalist
foundations, and neoliberal governments, public education has been
restructured around corporate-designed testing based on the
implementation of robotic common-core standards. This is generating
massive databases on the student population, much of which are now being
surreptitiously marketed and sold.19 The corporatization and
privatization of education is feeding the progressive subordination of
children's needs to the cash nexus of the commodity market. We are thus
seeing a dramatic return of Thomas Gradgrind's and Mr. M'Choakumchild's
crass utilitarian philosophy dramatized in Charles Dickens's Hard Times:
"Facts are alone wanted in life" and "You are never to fancy."20 Having
been reduced to intellectual dungeons, many of the poorest, most
racially segregated schools in the United States are mere pipelines for
prisons or the military.21

[More than [two million people in the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [are [behind
bars]{.mark}, a higher rate of incarceration than any other country in
the world, constituting a new Jim Crow]{.underline}. The total
population in prison is nearly equal to the number of people in Houston,
Texas, the fourth largest U.S. city. [African Americans and Latinos make
up 56 percent of those incarcerated, while constituting only about 32
percent of the U.S. population]{.underline}. Nearly 50 percent of
American adults, and a much higher percentage among African Americans
and Native Americans, have an immediate family member who has spent or
is currently spending time behind bars. [Both [black]{.mark} men [and
Native American men]{.mark} in the United States are nearly [three
times]{.mark}, Hispanic men nearly two times, [more likely to die of
police shootings]{.mark} than white men.22 **[Racial divides]{.mark} are
now [widening]{.mark} across the entire planet.**]{.underline}

[Violence against women and the expropriation of their unpaid labor, as
well as the higher level of exploitation of their paid labor, are
integral to the way in which power is organized in capitalist
society]{.underline}---and how it seeks to divide rather than unify the
population. More than a third of women worldwide have experienced
physical/sexual violence. [Women's bodies, in particular, are
objectified, reified, and commodified as part of the normal workings of
monopoly-capitalist marketing]{.underline}.23

[The mass media-propaganda system, part of the larger corporate matrix,
is now merging into a social media-based propaganda system that is more
porous and seemingly anarchic, but more universal and more than ever
favoring money and power.]{.underline} Utilizing modern marketing and
surveillance techniques, which now dominate all digital interactions,
[vested interests are able to tailor their messages, largely unchecked,
to individuals and their social networks, creating concerns]{.underline}
about "fake news" on all sides.24 Numerous [business entities promising
technological manipulation of voters]{.underline} in countries across
the world have now surfaced, auctioning off their services to the
highest bidders.25 The elimination of net neutrality in the United
States means further concentration, centralization, and control over the
entire Internet by monopolistic service providers.

Elections are increasingly prey to unregulated "dark money" emanating
from the coffers of corporations and the billionaire class. Although
presenting itself as the world's leading democracy, the United States,
as Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy stated in Monopoly Capital in 1966, "is
democratic in form and plutocratic in content."26 In the Trump
administration, following a long-established tradition, 72 percent of
those appointed to the cabinet have come from the higher corporate
echelons, while others have been drawn from the military.27

[[War, engineered by the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [and other major powers at the apex of the
system, has [become]{.mark} [perpetual]{.mark} in strategic oil regions
such as the Middle East, and [threatens to escalate into]{.mark} a
**[global thermonuclear exchange]{.mark}**]{.underline}. During the
Obama administration, the [United States was engaged in **wars/bombings
in seven different countries**]{.underline}---Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria,
Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan.28 [Torture and assassinations have
been reinstituted by Washington as acceptable instruments of
war]{.underline} against those now innumerable individuals, group
networks, and whole societies that are branded as terrorist. [A [new
Cold War and **nuclear arms race**]{.mark} **is [in the making]{.mark}**
between the United States and Russia]{.underline}, while Washington is
seeking to place road blocks to the continued rise of China. The Trump
administration has created a new space force as a separate branch of the
military in an attempt to ensure U.S. dominance in the militarization of
space. Sounding the alarm on the increasing dangers of a nuclear war and
of climate destabilization, the distinguished Bulletin of Atomic
[Scientists moved its [doomsday]{.mark} clock in 2018 to two minutes to
midnight, the [close]{.mark}st since 1953, when it **marked the [advent
of thermonuclear weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}.29

[Increasingly severe [economic sanctions]{.mark} are being
[imposed]{.mark} by the United States on countries like Venezuela and
Nicaragua]{.underline}, despite their democratic elections---or because
of them. [Trade and currency wars are being actively promoted by core
states]{.underline}, while racist barriers against immigration continue
to be erected in Europe and the United States as some [60 million
[refugees]{.mark} and internally [displaced]{.mark} peoples flee
devastated environments]{.underline}. Migrant populations worldwide have
risen to 250 million, with those residing in high-income countries
constituting more than 14 percent of the populations of those countries,
up from less than 10 percent in 2000. Meanwhile, [ruling circles and
wealthy countries seek to wall off islands of power and privilege from
the mass of humanity, who are to be left to their fate]{.underline}.30

[More than three-quarters of a billion people, over **[10 percent
of]{.mark} the world [population]{.mark}**, are chronically
[malnourished]{.mark}.]{.underline}31 [Food stress in the United States
**keeps climbing**]{.underline}, [leading to the rapid growth of cheap
dollar stores selling **poor quality and toxic food**.]{.underline}
Around forty million Americans, representing one out of eight
households, including nearly thirteen million children, are food
insecure.32 [Subsistence farmers are being pushed off their lands by
agribusiness]{.underline}, private capital, and sovereign wealth funds
in a global depeasantization process that constitutes the greatest
movement of people in history.33 [Urban overcrowding and poverty across
much of the globe is so severe that one can now reasonably refer to a
"planet of slums.]{.underline}"34 Meanwhile, the world housing market is
estimated to be worth up to \$163 trillion (as compared to the value of
gold mined over all recorded history, estimated at \$7.5 trillion).35

**[The [Anthropocene epoch]{.mark}]{.underline}**, first ushered in by
the Great Acceleration of the world economy immediately after the Second

[**[60 percent]{.mark} of the [world's wildlife]{.mark}** vertebrate
population (including mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and fish)
**have been [wiped out]{.mark} since 1970**]{.underline}, while the
worldwide abundance of invertebrates has declined by 45 percent in
recent decades.37 What climatologist James Hansen calls the **["species

**[[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}** and rapidly shifting climate
zones **[are only [compounding]{.mark} this general process of

that **[[half of all species]{.mark} will be]{.underline}** **[[facing

**[[If]{.mark} present climate-change [trends continue]{.mark}, the
"[global carbon budget]{.mark}"]{.underline}** associated **with a 2°C**

**[Earth System scientists warn that the world is now]{.underline}**

**[and]{.underline}** **[irreversible]{.underline}**.39 **[The

[**bankrolling** climate denialism]{.underline}---**[while admitting the
truth in their]{.underline}** [internal documents]{.underline}. **[These

gas-generating varieties, **[reaping enormous profits]{.underline}** in

up massive [additional oil and gas reserves]{.underline} **[to

consequences for the earth's climate.]{.underline}** In response to
scientific reports on climate change, Exxon Mobil declared that it
intends to extract and sell all of the fossil-fuel reserves at its
disposal.41 **[Energy corporations continue to intervene in climate

**[[Capitalism]{.mark} is best understood as a]{.underline}**
[competitive class-based **mode of production and exchange geared to

**[[exploit]{.mark}ation]{.underline} [of [workers']{.mark} labor power
and the private appropriation of]{.underline}** [surplus

[intrinsic to capitalism]{.underline} [**designates as a

market]{.underline}** **[are]{.underline}**
**[[excluded]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[in this form of valuation and are
treated as mere negative "externalities," unrelated to the capitalist
economy]{.underline}** itself---whether in terms of the shortening and
degradation of human life or the destruction of the natural environment.
As environmental economist K. William Kapp stated, "capitalism must be
regarded as an economy of unpaid costs."42

**[We have now reached a point]{.underline}** in the twenty-first

especially within the dominant highly developed centers of production
extract on an accelerated pace the fossil fuels needed to further create

While this is taking place, less advanced capitalist nations are focused
on catching up, attempting to gain access to natural resources required
for primitive accumulation. The resulting increase use of fossil fuels
by advanced capitalism coupled with the mimic desire to do the same by
underdeveloped capitalism only serves to increase degrading the

reaching the surface of the earth. [Ocean acidification]{.mark}. A
proportion of CO2 emissions dissolved in seawater making it more acidic
than in preindustrial times]{.underline}**. This can interfere with the
growth and survival of corals many shellfish and plankton causing the
collapse of essential food webs and drastic reduction in Fish eye Marine
mammal population**. [[Freshwater use]{.mark}. Heavy withdrawals for
agricultural and industrial uses are depleting major aquifers while
melting glaciers are illuminating the source water of many rivers. [Land
system change]{.mark}. About [42% of all ice-free land is currently use
for farming]{.mark}: that land formally supported 70% of the worlds'
grasslands 50% of savannas and 45% of temperate deciduous
forest]{.underline}**. Laws of this land reduces biodiversity and has
negative effects on Earth's climate and water systems. Atmospheric
aerosol loading. Most of what is cold air pollution consist of
microscopic particles and droplets called aerosols. Inhaling them causes
about 7.2 million deaths per year. Introduction of novel entities. There
are over 100,000 chemicals and plastic polymers in commercial use today.
For almost all very little is known about the individual or combined
effects on human or ecosystem health."4

These are some of the visible indicators of how **[[capital accumulation
generates]{.mark} this [life and death cycle in the environment]{.mark}.
The abnormality of capitalism is manifested as its overall dysfunction
in terms of the periodic breakdown and crisis of
accumulation.]{.underline}** The social effects of capitalism as a
dysfunctional social system can be understood in relation to Marx's
fetishism of commodities as an example of money as the ultimate
objective measurement placing value on people and things. As a byproduct
of capital cumulation money functions as it arbitrarily assigned value
and importance in terms of what the market will bear. In a strict
psychological sense this fetishism narrows the human personality so that
it overly emphasizes material needs at the expense of larger social
needs.

From the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, Marx presents the idea
of labor as the fulfillment of basic and social needs. His idea of
social needs are those collective needs which are necessary. The
development of social needs is to be understood as unalienated labor,
which is in control of the productive process. **[Labor power purchased
as a commodity and used to produce surplus value beyond the wage needed
for subsistence sets the stage for the alienation of labor followed by
the monetary fetishism.]{.underline}** A decline in profits increases
the tendency to ramp up the production of surplus value.

**[In principle, [democracy]{.mark} is [at odds with a capitalist
econ]{.mark}omy, as Erich Fromm discusses in Escape from Freedom. The
culture of [capitalism embraces]{.mark} this escape from having
responsibility for social freedom in favor of
[authoritarianism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Fromm explains, "The
feature common to all authoritarian thinking is the conviction that life
is determined by forces outside of man's own self, his interests, his
wishes. The only possible happiness lies in the submission to these
forces."5 Especially in an accumulation crisis, an emerging form of
authoritarian capitalism increases the tendency of capitalism to
self-destruct. **[Capitalism is [powerless to]{.mark} effectively
[resolve]{.mark} its inherent [contradictions]{.mark}, confronting the
environmental limits to capital accumulation but [continues to extract
resources]{.mark} which function to undermine the life of the
environment. Capitalism diminishes the global quality of life and
[increases the movement towards greater global
destruction]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In its Hobbesian version of a war of
all against all the culture of capitalism as Pacman (eat or be eaten),
nature is regarded as something to conquer and exploit. It leads one to
question the very sanity of a capitalist social system and what could be
in Fromm's words a sane society: "A society in which no man is a means
towards another's ends, but always and without exception an end in
himself; hence, where nobody is used, nor uses himself, for purposes
which are not those of the unfolding of his own human powers; where man
is the center, and where all economic and political activities are
subordinated to the aim of his growth. A sane society is one in which
qualities like greed, exploitiveness, possessiveness, narcissism, have
no chance to be used for greater material gain. . ."6 **[As a less than
sane social system, capitalism moves forward with the sole obsession
towards accumulating capital. Through the process of accumulation, the
power of capital strives to overcome and overwhelm barriers to
accumulation, reducing the quality of life to a more primitive, barbaric
state.]{.underline}**

By hyper-globalization, I mean the premise that cross-border trade and
capital movements should be free from regulatory restraints and national
industrial policies. **[This became [the new definition of "free
trade"]{.mark} and the object of intense U.S. diplomacy beginning in the
1980s. After 1990, this vision was codified in the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and in dozens of bilateral deals.]{.underline}**
Promoters of the shift invoked economic theory, but in practice it was
**[driven by the corporate [push]{.mark} to use [trade rules]{.mark}
aggressively to undermine national regulation of capitalism, from
banking (rebranded as "trade in financial services") to industry-created
pollution.]{.underline}**

**[NAFTA allowed corporations to sue in special courts to [challenge
health, safety, and environmental regulations as incursions on their
trading rights]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Within the EU, long-standing
**[[guarantees of collective bargaining were overturned]{.mark} as
impinging on the cross-border rights of capital]{.underline}**. WTO
rules became obstacles to distributing free or cheap vaccines in a
worldwide pandemic. Hyper-globalization was the global face of
neoliberalism, as well as its enforcer.

**[From the start, [the system was a bundle of contradictions]{.mark}.
Western leaders who sponsored this shift knew from their national
experience that unregulated markets are far from
efficient.]{.underline}** For almost a century, nations dealt with the
anomalies of markets by regulating finance, labor, health, and the
environment. They used industrial and research subsidies and public
ownership to help their economies develop. **[Wherever nations failed to
regulate, [capitalism created gross inequality and environmental
disasters]{.mark}, as well as [periodic financial bubbles, systemic
crashes, and prolonged depressions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But through
some mysterious alchemy, when commerce crossed borders, unregulated
markets were supposedly efficient after all. Free-traders never
explained the inconsistency.

For much of capitalism\'s history, the **[[consequences]{.mark} of its
environmental aspects]{.underline}** were not readily apparent but now,
at the start of the 21st century, they **[[cannot be
ignored]{.underline}]{.mark}**, despite being often camouflaged.

Atmospheric **[[pollution and]{.underline}]{.mark}** global
**[[warming]{.underline}]{.mark}**, due mainly to gross overuse of
fossil fuels, **[has [reached a stage where]{.mark}]{.underline}** even

**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** now **[[inevitable]{.mark},

\'unconventional\' or **[[\'extreme\' energy
production]{.underline}]{.mark}** such a **[star sands, hydraulic

Global climate change presents a real and instantaneous threat to the
lives billions. It seems likely that several crucial \'tipping points\'
have already been crossed which will now - whatever inadequate responses
are cobbled together - will inevitably result in a significant rise in
sea level, and possibly irreversible changes in weather patterns and
climate regimes.

To implement humane and rational plans for the human race the combined
knowledge, initiative, skill, imagination and enthusiasm of the
countless millions of people who have no material interest in
profiteering - the working class - is indispensable

**[[The problem does not lie in tech]{.mark}nology,
[but]{.mark}]{.underline}** in **[[the]{.mark} ability or [inability of
the economic and social system]{.mark} to manage it. A system based on
private profit is incapable]{.underline}** of handling an energy
delivery programme where the interests of society as a whole and those
of future generations are a priority. **[Addressing]{.underline}**
realistically the **[needs of]{.underline}** both energy
**[production]{.underline}** **[and demand]{.underline}** along with

massive investment and planning with (**[re-)nationalisations, under

**[Food production is]{.underline}** largely **[divorced

**[and driven]{.underline}** almost entirely **[by

**[waste]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** the **[rich]{.underline}**
developed world, **[and shortage and famine]{.underline}** in the
**[\'underdeveloped\']{.underline}** world **[reveals]{.underline}**
capitalism\'s character of exacerbating **[inequality]{.underline}**.

Marx elaborated the contradiction of food production with workings of
the capitalist system. \'All progress in capitalistic agriculture is a
progress, not only of robbing the labourer, but of robbing the soil; all
progress in increasing the fertility of the soil for a given time, is a
progress towards ruining the lasting sources of that fertility.\'
(Capital Vol-I). Increase in agricultural productivity since the World
War II has outstripped increases in productivity in every area but at
the cost of the destruction of whole societies driving millions from the
land into poverty and precariousness in the squalor of shantytowns on
the edges of megacities in the ex-colonial world.

However, the system of private ownership and profiteering cannot even
secure human survival. **[To implement]{.underline}** humane and

## Unsustainable

### 1NC \-- Unsustainable

#### Capitalism is the [root cause]{.underline} to our ecological [crisis]{.underline} -- certain [extinction]{.underline}. Decapitalization is the [only]{.underline} solution.

Erin **Remblance** **22** \[Erin Remblance, 2-22-2022, \"Decapitalising
our minds: the key to addressing climate change,\" Resilience,
https://www.resilience.org/stories/2022-02-22/decapitalising-our-minds-the-key-to-addressing-climate-change/,
smarx, HHW\]

[[Emissions continue to rise. Governments]{.mark} are [failing
us]{.mark}. A '[global tipping point]{.mark}' [could]{.mark} be
[activate]{.mark}d [in]{.mark} as little as [five years]{.mark}. Why
aren't we doing more to solve the greatest threat humanity has ever
faced?]{.underline}

[[Capitalism]{.mark} is [the root cause of our ecological crisis
and]{.mark} the [**key barrier** to solving it]{.mark}]{.underline}.
There are two reasons for this. Firstly, because [[capitalism cannot
exist without economic growth]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[economic
growth]{.mark} is the [main reason why]{.mark} our [emissions have been
increasing]{.mark}]{.underline} over the last 30 years and [[further
growth]{.mark} will [make it impossible to decarbonise]{.mark} in time
to avoid [activat]{.mark}ing [tipping points]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Secondly, because our minds have been shaped by capitalism and it is
stopping us from seeing both the role capitalism plays in the cause of
climate change and the full scope of solutions available to address the
crisis. Social psychologist, Professor Harald Welzer, sums this up well,
describing economic growth of industrial societies as "enshrined in
business and politics, but also in the psychological structure of the
people who grow up in such societies."

There are six key ways in which capitalism shapes our minds. [Under
[capitalism]{.mark} we, collectively, [believe]{.mark}:]{.underline}

[[Nature is]{.mark} nothing more than a '[resource']{.mark} to be
exploited]{.underline}

Our power lies in our consumption habits

Success lies in evermore material items and novel experiences

[[People are]{.mark} a '[resource']{.mark}]{.underline} and must earn
their living

Money is scarce and the government must make choices

[[We must compete]{.mark} with others]{.underline}

[This ['capitalisation']{.mark} of our minds [creates]{.mark} a [barrier
to solving]{.mark} the climate [crisis]{.mark} in many ways,
including:]{.underline}

[denial that the crisis exists [because]{.mark} the [solutions don't
fit]{.mark} one's [capitalistic ideology]{.mark};]{.underline}

[disinterest and disengagement with the crisis because nature is for
others to focus on]{.underline};

unconscious of how our minds are shaped by capitalism, we:

champion solutions that are well-intentioned but inadequate because they
assume mythical 'green-growth';

implement targets that aren't supported by policies to achieve them,
instead relying on technology that doesn't currently exist to cover the
gap.

[Unsurprisingly, the mindset we need to address the climate crisis is
the exact opposite of the mindset described above.]{.underline}

**[[We are entirely dependent on nature]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[Across the planet]{.mark}, from rainforests and indigenous lands to
oceans and mountain tops, [we view nature]{.mark} as existing for us to
plunder, dominate, and use [to fuel our economic
growth]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Nature is myopically viewed as nothing
more than a resource that those with enough money can 'own' and exploit
for gain, excluding all others from the use of those
resources]{.underline}. Furthermore, in a desperate attempt to not
address the root cause of the climate crisis, [[we are betting]{.mark}
[the planet's ability to sustain life on technology that does not yet
exist]{.mark}, [exacerbating other ecological crises]{.mark} in the
process]{.underline}. This is **[not rational behaviour]{.underline}**.
This is delusional and symptomatic of a collective mindset that believes
technology rules over all else and that nature can be tamed.

[We [need to cherish nature]{.mark} for **[without it we cannot
exist]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We are a part of nature, not separate from
it, and we are entirely dependent on it for humanity's survival. [Rather
than selling off our natural environment to create private wealth we
should be holding it in trust for future generations]{.underline}.
Because we think we are separate to nature, we often 'other' people who
care about the environment as 'greenies' or 'environmentalists' and
dismiss their concerns as 'passions' which allows us to mentally
compartmentalise them as someone with different beliefs and priorities
to us when what we really should be doing is listening, questioning,
learning and ultimately joining them.

**[[System change]{.mark} is the [only solution]{.mark}]{.underline}**

It's highly likely, if you are at all concerned about the climate
crisis, you've had the thought "what can I do?" and concluded something
along the lines of reducing your energy needs, switching to renewable
energy, driving & flying less, buying an electric vehicle and eating
less meat: actions that relate to how you, individually, spend your
money. This is perhaps one of capitalism's greatest achievements because
it has rendered us unlikely to actually change capitalism itself. By
reducing people to 'consumers' that believe they have little power
beyond that of their consumption habits, the inertia to come together as
citizens and communities of like-minded people to take collective action
is significant. This is how capitalism likes it. Fittingly, it was a PR
company engaged by BP that devised the personal carbon footprint
concept, precisely to put the focus back on individuals and distract
from the huge emissions generated by their business and their
responsibility to address it.

Whilst individual actions are well-intended and an important
'entry-point', we are now so late in the game that [[acting as consumers
won't cut it]{.mark}. We [need to]{.mark} use our collective power as
citizens to [influence]{.mark} as many people as we can and ensure we
vote in [leaders]{.mark} [who will change the economic system]{.mark} to
one that is [focused]{.mark} not on growth, but [on the wellbeing of
people and the planet]{.mark}]{.underline}. We need to adopt a war-like
mindset and work together, finding strength in numbers.
[[Otherwise]{.mark}, the enduring [legacy of our lifetimes]{.mark} [will
be the **collapse of human civilisation**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Falling profits and realization crisis are [inevitable]{.underline} -- ultimately [doom]{.underline} capitalism

Raag **Trivedi 22** \[Popular Posts, 1-22-2022, \"How Did Karl Marx
Predict The Fall Of Capitalism?,\" Science ABC,

DOA: 6-18-2022, smarx, HHW\]

[Karl [Marx predicted several crises]{.mark}. The [two major]{.mark}
ones are the [realization crisis and]{.mark} the [falling]{.mark} rate
of [profit]{.mark}. According to him, [such events]{.mark} would [end
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. The time period of the 1920s to the
early 1930s saw [[severe unemployment]{.mark}, [economic depression,
hyperinflation and global hysteria]{.mark}. This period is known as "The
Great Depression"]{.underline}. The first world war, which ended in
1917, was a major reason behind this economic catastrophe.

Since many countries were involved in the war, and not all of them were
on the same side, the experience of the Great Depression varies from
country to country. For example, Germany encountered its Great
Depression from the early 1920s onward, while the United States of
America saw its decline in the year 1929.

To give you some idea of how bad the situation was, imagine that the
currency of Germany in 1922 was "marks". In Germany (1922), one loaf of
bread would cost about 163 marks. When September 1923 arrived, this same
loaf of bread would cost 1.5 million marks. By 1923, at the height of
economic decline, one loaf of bread in Germany cost about 200 million
marks (Source).

[However, in the midst of all this turmoil, there were some people who
were happier than ever]{.underline}. There was a [section of people in
society who saw all this turmoil as temporary, leading to something
greater, something that they had believed in for a long
time.]{.underline} These were the Marxists. The [Marxists saw this
severe depression as the end of capitalism, something Karl Marx had
predicted in his writings]{.underline} in the 19th century. So... why
did they believe that the Great Depression was the end? How had Marx
predicted the end of capitalism?

Karl Marx, as an author, went through two major phases in his life. The
first was the idealistic, while the second was the materialistic. The
idealistic phase is when Marx focused on human suffering, what
capitalism as a structure does to society and how it creates a class
divide etc. After this, [[Marx]{.mark} decided to [analyze]{.mark} the
economic workings of a [capitalist system]{.mark}. It was in this phase,
with his classics like Das Kapital, that he [delivered]{.mark} some of
[his iconic phrases:]{.mark}]{.underline} "[[Capitalism will create its
own fall]{.mark}", due to the economic crises that any capitalist
[system would **eventually suffer**]{.mark}. The [two]{.mark} major
[types of capitalist crises are]{.mark}:]{.underline}

**[[Realization Crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[Falling Rate of Profit]{.underline}]{.mark}**

For the purpose of understanding these crises, let's assume that you are
an industrialist, and have a lot of money to invest in any field.

Realization Crisis

This crisis is also known as the crisis of demand.

Consider the example where you are an industrialist. Imagine that you've
been working in the gold industry for a long time, and the profits are
no longer large. Like any other investor, you will now be looking to
invest in a market that is fairly new, has big returns and, and will
have balance. What balance is this? The balance of supply and demand!

Once you enter a new market (provided that your product is successful),
the demand for your product increases and you start getting big
benefits. [[As]{.mark} the [demand for]{.mark} your [product
increases]{.mark}, you [increase]{.mark} the [costs]{.mark} and slowly
try [to reap more benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [growing
demand]{.mark} for your product [puts]{.mark} your [production in
overdrive]{.mark}, so you keep producing more and more, thinking that
there are always people that will want to buy the product.]{.underline}
However, after a point, because of the expanding market, you [increase
prices slowly and the [product gets more expensive]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Due to the fact that your product is successful, [[people still try to
buy it]{.mark}, but [after a point,]{.mark} they [can **no longer
afford**]{.mark} **your [product]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

**[Economic Bubble Burst]{.underline}**

[A [situation]{.mark} finally [arises]{.mark} [in]{.mark} which you
[keep producing]{.mark} your product, [but]{.mark} there is [no
demand]{.mark} for it anymore. How does this happen?]{.underline} This
can only happen when there is a separation between the laborers and
consumers. [The [wages of the laborers will be lowered]{.mark} to
exploit them to a maximum benefit]{.underline}. This phase, in which
your [production and benefits expand, is called [an "economic
bubble]{.mark}". [When]{.mark} the [bubble bursts]{.mark}, the price of
the [product is exorbitant]{.mark}, there is [too much]{.mark} of it,
and [nobody wants any]{.mark} of it!]{.underline}

**[[Falling Rate of Profit]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Now, go back to the example where you are an industrialist. Let's assume
that upon leaving the gold industry, you decide to join the paper-making
industry. The regular way would be to get the machinery and laborers,
and then start up production. However, if you invest in better machinery
at the first stage, that could change the game. [[If]{.mark} you have
[better machinery]{.mark}, your production will be much more efficient
and you [can achieve]{.mark} what is known as a "[super
profit]{.mark}".]{.underline}

[For a while, you will [enjoy huge benefits]{.mark}.
[Eventually]{.mark}, your new [machinery]{.mark} will be [open to
everyone]{.mark}, however, and [everyone else]{.mark} will start [using
the same machinery]{.mark} as you. This will [result in]{.mark} your
[profit]{.mark}s [drop]{.mark}ping; [eventually]{.mark}, the
[market]{.mark} will come to a grinding [halt]{.mark}, until another set
of "new machinery" is introduced in the market.]{.underline}

#### Capitalism is destroying the Earth -- the remaining healthy ecosystems are being commodified and extracted

[[Plans for]{.mark} the expropriation and [accumulation of natural
capital by global finance are primarily directed today at the Global
South.]{.mark} According to the UN Environment Programme, spatial
mapping of natural capital indicates there is "a high concentration of
terrestrial ecosystem assets in the equatorial regions, particularly in
the Brazilian Amazon and the Congo Basin." [Marine ecosystem assets are
highest in Southeast Asia (the South China Sea) and along
coastlines]{.mark}.14 [Indigenous territories]{.mark} cover some 24
percent of the earth's land surface and ["contain 80% of the earth's
remaining healthy ecosystems and]{.mark} global [biodiversity priority
areas," making these primary targets for expropriation and conversion
into marketable natural capital. Sub-Saharan Africa is a target since
"it's estimated that around 90% of land is untitled," with the result
that many Indigenous communities that have lived in these areas for
untold years lack official land titles, and their land is therefore open
to land grabbing.]{.mark}]{.underline}15 The African Forum on Green
Economy, working with the Natural Capital Coalition and the World
Wildlife Fund, stated in 2020 that "natural capital is part of a wider
economic system," implying that Africa's ecosystems can be completely
subsumed within the capitalist economy.16 [The [implications of this
rapid financialization of nature,]{.mark} which is [promoting a Great
Expropriation]{.mark} of the global commons [and]{.mark} the
[dispossession of humanity on a scale exceeding all previous human
history]{.mark}, are vast. This Great Expropriation is [being justified
on the grounds of saving nature by turning it into a market, thereby
replacing the laws of nature with the laws of commodity value.]{.mark}
Yet, not only is [the logic behind this]{.mark} fallacious, but it is
also likely to widen the associated colossal financial bubbles, while
[accelerating destruction of planetary ecosystems and of the earth as a
safe home for humanity.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In the foreseeable future wild capitalism (neoliberalism) will be over
because **[the [unlimited growth]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the monstrous

[with]{.mark} planetary boundaries and the carrying capacity of [the

Anthropocene. So what kind of model will replace neoliberalism? In this
chapter I summarise some alternatives formulated by social scientists
and movements, and refer to the Kingdom of Bhutan, which happens to be a
real-life example, not based on any model but on the philosophical
principles of Buddhism, which informs social practice, thinking and
customs in that country. From my perspective, the name of the model to
be established is unimportant; **[what matters is that [neoliberalism

previous pages, **[[IR theory]{.mark} [has]{.mark} [several]{.mark}

the satisfaction of **[human [needs]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [**[The

"sucked down" by "the alternatives that will appear in all parts of the
world", as Latour argues (2015: 218), because the political order is
always interwoven with the natural order.

### 2NC -- Unsustainable

#### Capitalism caused climate change

Climate Change, an Undeniable Reality

[There is a broad scientific consensus that [climate change is related
to the dizzying increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a
result of human activity. But the problem is not human activity in
general. The problem is the activities carried out within a capitalist
mode of production.]{.mark}]{.underline} Since 1880, the average
temperature on the earth's surface has risen by almost 1 degree Celsius,
according to different investigative bodies. An increase in the global
average temperature began during the Industrial Revolution and has
accelerated in the neoliberal era.

[Projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
indicate that the average global surface temperature could increase by 2
to 5 degrees Celsius (3.6 and 9 degrees Fahrenheit) in the coming
decades. Ocean levels could rise by 18 to 59 centimeters (7 to 23
inches). The IPCC warns that past and future emissions of carbon dioxide
(CO2) will continue to contribute to warming for more than a millennium.
[At the same time, CO2 particles in the atmosphere recently exceeded 400
parts for million (ppm), and may even reach 500 ppm in the coming
decades, levels never seen in human history.]{.mark}]{.underline}

According to the latest report by this UN agency (whose estimates are
usually very conservative compared to other studies), emissions of
greenhouse gases would have to be reduced by 45% by the year 2030---in
less than 11 years---in order to avoid hitting the critical threshold of
1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. Above this level, there will be a
generalized increase in ocean levels, extreme weather events and food
shortages. The need for drastic measures against climate change is
undeniable.

For many people, these estimates may seem abstract. But they become
concrete when their real consequences are felt, in the form of the
stronger climate-related catastrophic phenomena, with increased duration
and frequency. Uncontrollable fires sweeping through entire cities
around the globe (which is also associated with the spread of invasive
species and forest management practices devoted to monoculture for
profit), extreme heat waves, massive floods or catastrophic droughts.
According to the UN, there are currently more than 20 million climate
refugees. If the global temperature rises to more than 2 degrees, it is
estimated that this number will grow to 280 million. Air pollution
caused by vehicles (gases and particles) and industrial production in
large cities kills 9 million people a year---800,000 in Europe alone.

[[Global warming is one of the most devastating expressions of the
destructive nature of the capitalist system toward the
environment.]{.mark} But it is not the only one. [Capitalism also leads
to the pollution of our air and water, soil degradation, deforestation,
and the destruction of biodiversity]{.mark}. According to one study, the
size of vertebrate populations has decreased by an average of 60 percent
between 1970 and 2014. This trend will accelerate if the ecological
crisis is not halted, and could produce a mass extinction of the
planet's biodiversity. [The entire planet has been transformed into a
giant garbage dump for the household, industrial and agricultural waste
generated by capitalist]{.mark} production, distribution and consumption
[patterns.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Even new ways of combating climate change fail under capitalism

Green Reformism and the Green New Deal

On the spectrum of the defenders of green capitalism, there is a
reformist variant that has gained a lot of attention recently: the Green
New Deal, which calls for a program with hints of neo-Keynesianism in
order to face the crisis. In the United States, this policy is supported
by some candidates in the primaries of the Democratic Party, including
Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and also by the self-styled
democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The GND is also appearing
in speeches and programs by European social-liberal parties like the
PSOE or neoreformist tendencies like Podemos.

According to Ocasio-Cortez, the GND would allow the U.S. to transition
to 100% renewable energy within 10 years, while creating millions of
jobs linked to the construction of an efficient electrical grid
throughout the country based on renewable technology, among other
measures. How? By subsidizing billion-dollar corporations, the ones
responsible for the current ecological crisis, so they can develop
infrastructure to get us out of it. For this, they are to receive
massive subsidies from the state.

The idea behind this perspective is that if the governments of the
central industrialized countries in the world and the big multinational
corporations become aware of the situation, they will be able to adopt
measures to preserve the environment. [[Both the Green New Deal and
similar proposals]{.mark} (like the UN Agenda 2020), which are reference
points for many "progressive" forces around the planet, [are based on
the idea that "sustainable capitalism" is possible]{.mark} and that the
corporations that created the crisis can become the saviors of the
planet. [But the illusion that the contradictions between capitalist
interests and environmental preservation---affecting the lives of
hundreds of millions of people---can be resolved is utopian and
reactionary.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The capitalist mode of production is in total contradiction with nature
and its processes of development. For capital, the determining factor in
this process is merely quantitative. [Fierce competition forces each
capitalist to constantly seek ways to replace workers with machines that
increase the productivity of labor and the mass of goods thrown onto the
market. [This increases the amount of natural resources needed to
produce them. The constant repetition of production and reproduction of
capital ruthlessly eats up all resources, without taking into account
the time required for their natural production and
regeneration.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The cause of this type of environmentally destructive development,
rather than capitalist irrationality, is its inherent logic. It is the
logical result of an economic system whose engine is the capitalists'
thirst for profit.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Capitalism fails -- unlimited growth in a limited world dooms it. A radical redirection is needed

**Vercelli '17** \[Alessandro; 2017; Professor of Economics in the
Department of Political Economy and Statistics of the University of
Siena.; CRISIS AND SUSTAINABILITY:­ The Delusion of Free Markets, "The
Neoliberal Trajectory and the Crisis," Ch. 5, p. 119-121\] SPark

This chapter argues that the **[recent [global crisis is]{.mark} the
[direct consequence of]{.mark} a development paradigm that is
[unsustainable]{.mark} from the economic, financial, social, and
environmental [point of view]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Such a model
became]{.mark} progressively [dominant since]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
late 1970s when the **[[neoliberal]{.mark} policy [strategy]{.mark}
started to [become hegemonic]{.mark}]{.underline}** at the world level.
2

**[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** increasing flexibility of labour
**[[market]{.mark} and the progressive dismantlement of the welfare
state progressively [increased]{.mark} income and wealth [inequality,
causing]{.mark} a growing [polarisation]{.mark} [among]{.mark} social
[classes that]{.mark} has [undermined]{.mark} social
[cohesion]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 3 In addition, this process reduced
the purchasing power of middle and lower classes **[[and
increased]{.mark} the [poverty]{.mark} plague]{.underline}** also in
several industrialised countries (social unsustainability).
**[[This]{.mark} tendency [brought]{.mark}]{.underline}** about a
downward trend of aggregate demand that contributed to slow **[[down the
growth rate]{.mark} in many countries]{.underline}** (economic
unsustainability). The increasing indebtedness of the economic agents
that has contributed to sustain their demand 4 and the rapid
financialisation of the economy that has progressively increased the
contribution of finance to income formation partially offset this
tendency. This sort of "doping" of aggregate demand, however, was not
sufficient to keep the growth rate of industrialised countries at the
same level experienced during the Bretton Woods era (1945-1971), a
period that was characterised by a predominant Keynesian policy
strategy. 5 In addition, **[the rapid increase of private and public
debt and the hypertrophy of finance have undermined the financial
stability of the system]{.underline}**. Severe financial crises, that
were absent during the Bretton Woods period, reappeared during the 1970s
and progressively increased their frequency, intensity, and geographical
extension (financial unsustainability) . 6

The monetary policy aimed to sustain the value of financial assets
pursued by the Federal Reserve under Greenspan (1987-2006) and his
successor Bernanke (2006-2014), and then adopted by most other central
bankers, managed to moderate the adverse effects of financial
instability, though only in the short term. At the same time, however,
this policy favoured the spread of ever-increasing speculative bubbles
that transferred into the future the risks of the growing financial
fragility up to the outburst of the recent global crisis.

**[The deep and persistent financial [turmoil]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
originated by the subprime crisis in 2007, **[and the consequent
recession of the real economy [are]{.mark} thus [the result of]{.mark} a
deleterious interaction between different dimensions of
[unsustainability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[The financial
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in its turn, **[has remarkably
[worsened]{.mark} many [socia]{.mark}l and [economic]{.mark}
sustainability [indicators generating a]{.mark} vicious [circle]{.mark}
that became increasingly [difficult to reverse]{.mark}. The
[environmental unsustainability of the]{.mark} [existing]{.mark}
development [model]{.mark} greatly [reinforced]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
recent [crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While the speculative bubble of
the real estate sector started to deflate in the USA, the oil price
rapidly increased from less than \$50 per barrel in 2005 to a new record
of about \$150 in spring 2008. This provoked a rise in the production
costs of all goods (particularly of food). The central banks reacted to
the consequent cost inflation with a significant increase in the
discount rate that raised the loans' interest rate. This undermined the
borrowers' capacity to comply with mortgage payments, compelling many of
them to sell their house or to default. The consequent collapse of the
housing market sank the price of mortgage-based derivatives triggering a
contagion process in the financial system.

**[This analysis calls for a systematic revision of the current
development paradigm towards a more sustainable direction. [We]{.mark}
urgently [need a radical redirection]{.mark} of the
development]{.underline}** trajectory to get out of the present crisis
and start up a new development phase.

#### Capitalism is an unsustainable fairy tale - extinction

**Velden '21** \[John van der and Rob White; 2017; Leader of Global
Sales & Technology at Linde Engineering, former Vice President of
Business development at Chicago Bridge and Iron company, former

in the climate endgame, "THE EXTINCTION CODE WITHIN THE CAPITALIST
GROWTH PROTOCOL," Ch. 3, p. 33-34\] SPark

In its fundamentals, **[[extinction-level]{.mark} ecological
[degradation]{.mark} and transformation [are]{.mark} specific
[features]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [capitalist]{.mark} economic
[growth]{.mark} imperatives]{.underline}**. These are
**[[inseparable]{.mark} [from]{.mark} the]{.underline}** cyclical
expansionary and contractionary **[dynamics in
accumulation]{.underline}**, **[and divergent class structures of power
and interests]{.underline}**. There is no shortage of commentaries that
argue **[this integrated ecological crisis is a consequence of
[industrialisation]{.mark}, unregulated [capitalism]{.mark}, [neo-
liberalism]{.mark}, [free-market]{.mark} fundamentalist
[ideology]{.mark}, [extensive]{.mark} fossil fuel use,
[excessive]{.mark} [consumption]{.mark} [and]{.mark}/or
[population]{.mark} [explosion]{.mark}]{.underline}**. What is striking
about these is that the problem is not necessarily equated to capitalism
and its core growth imperative per se. It is features of the system, not
the system itself, that tends to be targeted for criticism. The growing
conundrum is that even the everyday Jo on the street intuitively grasps
(like the School Strikers for Climate) that an endless growth economy is
at odds with finite resources, that an endless expansion of consumption
is required to absorb an endless growth in production, and that endless
expansion of production and consumption means, if nothing else, endless
by-product expansion of waste from planned obsolescence and pollution,
even with diligent re-cycling. Also, intuitively grasped, is that the
rich invest in order to get richer. **[[The]{.mark} key [puzzle]{.mark}
[demanding]{.mark} [explanation]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [why]{.mark}
[anyone]{.mark} [thinks]{.mark} that [an economic system based]{.mark}
up[on]{.mark} [endless]{.mark} [growth on a finite]{.mark}
[planet]{.mark}, and a tiny rich minority getting richer relative to the
vast social majority, somehow [will not be punctuated by]{.mark}
recurring [crises]{.mark} and systemic collapses - economic and
ecological]{.underline}**. This is the great myth/silence that emanates
from the corridors of power and their spin merchants. **[[We are]{.mark}
sleep[walking]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [catastrophe]{.mark} pursuing 'endless
growth and affluence for all'.]{.underline}** It's a fairy tale that
school children openly and publicly acknowledge in their social media
posts, rally speeches and placards. Yet **[[it's a fairy
tale]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[that]{.mark} seemingly [infects]{.mark}
many seasoned [reform]{.mark} eco-[capitalists]{.mark}]{.underline}**:
that a green capitalism, or a no-growth capitalism, or a 'we are all in
this together' more altruistic and benign capitalist system and ruling
class, is possible. **[[There is an extinction code of
exploitation]{.mark} that lies [at the core of]{.mark} contemporary
[capitalist]{.mark} [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This capitalist
relation of exploitation with regard to labour and the natural world is
poorly understood or acknowledged. Partly, this misunderstanding flows
from pejorative connotations of the term 'exploitation'. Yet, this form
of appropriation of the social surplus remains central to understanding
how capitalism as capitalism actually works

Thus**[, I am not in any doubt that [the]{.mark} whole [world]{.mark}

[source]{.mark} of the extinction [is human
agency]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, it is also clear that
**[this [unconscious, irresponsible]{.mark} and predatory [behaviour is
not perpetrated by humankind]{.mark} as a whole, [but]{.mark} by its
ruling [capitalist classes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Within that segment
of society rentiers **[[oligarchies]{.mark} are]{.underline}** the main
**[culprits because they have been [managi]{.mark}ng [the economy in an

[capital]{.mark} [and not]{.mark} of [human]{.mark} [needs]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} still less with adequate regard for the [conservation of

preaches the worshipping of 'markets') produces a mindset which
**[[rationalizes this]{.mark} kind of behaviour [and justifies an
economy based on "fossil capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (Angus 2016)
**[through its dependence on natural gas, petrol and carbon as the main

humanity]{.underline}**. That is why I have given this book such an
arresting and interrogative title that is related to the fact that, as
we are already living in the Anthropocene, either **[[we must put an end

[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I will discuss some philosophical

Abstract:

[[Global economic growth leads to]{.mark} the [increased consumption
of]{.mark} natural [resources, pollution, and loss of biodiversity and
simultaneously widens]{.mark} the income [gap between]{.mark} the
[wealthy and]{.mark} the [poor]{.mark}]{.underline}. Kim Stanley
Robinson's New York 2140 provides a fictional glimpse of the world 120
years in the future, examining the [severe environmental changes that
have taken place and how people of upper and [lower economic
classes]{.mark} are [unevenly impacted]{.mark} by these
changes]{.underline}. The experiences of the fictional characters
reflect real issues that future generations will experience as
[[irreversible changes to]{.mark} our [climate]{.mark} are
made.]{.underline}

unpaid costs]{.mark} right in the teeth"]{.underline} (Robinson 4).
Modern economic growth and [demand for goods require rapid production at
low costs, [lead]{.mark}ing [to]{.mark} the **inevitable [exploitation
of nature and workers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Kim Stanley Robinson's New
York 2140 explores the world one hundred and twenty years into the
future, where the [drastic [continuation of climate change]{.mark} has
[result]{.mark}ed [in]{.mark} a [50-foot rise in]{.mark} the global [sea
level]{.mark}, destroying coastal cities worldwide]{.underline}. Each
section of the novel is broken into 8 parts, seen through the eyes of 10
different characters living in New York City in the year 2140. The
characters hold various roles in society, ranging from political leaders
to investors to orphaned children. Each of the characters' lives
intertwine, showing their daily interactions amid a changed and chaotic
world. Robinson depicts what everyday life would look like for New
Yorkers, and the rest of the world, if no significant measures are taken
to prevent climate change and environmental destruction. The novel
highlights the [income inequalities that both drive climate change and
influence how people survive those changes.]{.underline} This paper
examines two important narratives in New York 2140 to argue that
[climate change is driven by capitalism, which in turn changes how
people experience climate change.]{.underline}

[Global [capitalism and economic expansion]{.mark} are [driving]{.mark}
forces for both [income inequality]{.mark} [and climate
change.]{.mark}]{.underline} The global economy within New York 2140
reflects the same systems in place today, with the existence of [[global
cap]{.mark}italism [driving]{.mark} production and
[consumption]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Most **[climate scientists]{.mark}
have come to [agree]{.mark} that the [cause of climate change is]{.mark}
the [increased emission]{.mark} of greenhouse gases**, specifically
carbon dioxide, [which]{.mark} have **[increased rapidly since]{.mark}
the [Industrial Revolution]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Baer 2). [Progressive
scholars recognize the serious damage that results from a global
capitalist drive.]{.underline} [[Endless efforts of]{.mark} private
[owners to expand]{.mark} and increase their [profits force]{.mark} a
"perpetual [treadmill of production and
consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}" [**[relying]{.mark} mainly [on fossil
fuels]{.mark}** or]{.underline} alternative sources of [greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline} (Baer 4). In 2010, the International Energy
Agency projected that by 2030, global energy use would rise over 50%,
with fossil fuels still the primary source of energy (Baer 64). [Our
continued dependence on the fossil fuel industry will continue to raise
global temperatures [as]{.mark} a **[direct result of global
cap]{.mark}italism. The most [profitable decisions]{.mark} will [never
be]{.mark} the most [environmentally friendly]{.mark}**]{.underline},
thus private owners of [corporations will refrain from making
environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.]{.underline}

There is an **[increasing acceptance that [capitalism is directly

**[[apocalyptic consequences]{.mark} of it [are]{.mark} already
[causing]{.mark} [deaths, diseases, dislocations and destruction to

relations, all of which are associated with profit maximisation and
[exploitation]{.mark} of people and nature]{.underline}**. It is
important to emphasise that the privilege to profit, overconsume and
overdiscard is reserved for a small portion of society. The extraction
of fossil fuels (oil, coal, natural gas), which is the biggest cause of
climate change, enables large-scale production of goods, transportation
systems and efficient distribution networks of products and services.

Even worse, **[[the]{.mark} [capitalist]{.mark} system]{.underline}**
itself **[[operates]{.mark} in]{.underline}** [such]{.mark} **[a way
[that]{.mark} the]{.underline}** purpose of production (**[the

**[but]{.underline}** is **[[concerned]{.underline}]{.mark}**
exclusively **[with increasing [profits and]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
accumulation of **[[capital]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What is of interest
to transnational corporations is that the technocrats at their service
should remain committed to the constant renewal of products, from mobile
phones to computers, software, and electronic devices of all types,
including automobiles. **[[The commitment]{.mark} to this
[is]{.mark}]{.underline}** required to be **[[so great]{.mark} that
[concern for the environmental]{.mark} impact [disappears]{.mark}, among
other reasons because they do not worry about the damage that industrial
waste causes to the environment. The [interests of big capital
are]{.mark} always very [short term]{.mark}: to [retain the]{.mark}
decision-making [power]{.mark} within companies, to [stay

**[long term]{.underline}**, and still less about its long-term
sustainability, i.e. about the conservation of the environment and
terrestrial ecosystems in the framework of human needs, understood
according to the matrix of Neef, Elizalde and Hopenhayn reproduced
earlier in this chapter.

The most concerning aspect is that this type of attitude and behaviour
(along with the consumerist ideology that justifies it), is rooted not
only in the rich classes but also in the middle classes - including the
middle classes of developing countries across the world - something
largely due to the demonstration effect that is transmitted by
advertising and the media in general. Diamond cites, as a paradigmatic
case of **[[this 'contagion' of consumerism]{.mark} social
pathology,]{.underline}** the custom of discarding in the Dominican
Republic. This example can be applied to most middle-class sectors that
have been emerging in the whole world, as it **[[demonstrates]{.mark}
that [failure to take]{.mark} the appropriate [measures]{.mark} could
[lead to an apocalypse]{.mark}]{.underline}** that will not take the
form of a devastating planetary earthquake, a new ice age or a gigantic
tsunami like the catastrophes in movies, but will simply be that "**[[we

With **[[the rise of neoliberalism]{.mark}, the U.S. [entered an era of
anemic public investment]{.mark}]{.underline}**, shown in Fig. 2. As of
2018, U**[.S. federal government nondefense investment was 43% below
1967 levels]{.underline}**---falling from over 2.5% of GDP in the 1970s
to just over 1.5% in the Reagan administration.8 **[The U.S. experienced
a particularly [significant decline in largescale public works
projects]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In a 2014 report, the U.S. Treasury
noted that "**[the economic case for expanding infrastructure investment
is clear, yet public investment has been declining]{.underline}** as
part of a long-term trend toward fiscal consolidation and lower public
investment" (U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2014). **[The lack of
investment]{.underline}** in U.S. infrastructure **[will cost the
economy an estimated \$4 trillion]{.underline}** in GDP between 2016 and
2025 (American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), 2016) --- without
accounting for costs associated with climate change.

**[[Much greater public investment is needed for rapid
decarbonization]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As an example of how **[public
research and development (R&D) can transform an entire
industry]{.underline}**, **[consider]{.underline}** the case of **[solar
power. The price of Solar Photovoltaic (PV) panels has declined 99% over
the past four decades. This occurred due to significant investments in
public R&D along with market-based incentives and public
investments]{.underline}** to deploy PV. While economies of scale have
played an important role in more recent years, Kavlak et al. (2018) find
that R&D, much of which was publicly financed, played a dominant role in
cost reduction. Following these successes, the U.S. government created
the Advanced Research Projects Agency--Energy (ARPA-E) in 2006 to
advance technologies in the energy sector by supporting high-risk,
high-reward research which was systematically underprovided in the
private sector (Azoulay et al., 2019). Despite the program's success in
energy-related innovation, ranging from energy efficiency to energy
storage and transportation, the program remains too narrowly defined and
drastically underfunded (Paul et al., 2019). In 2018 ARPA-E's budget was
\$353 million, roughly one tenth of DARPA's annual budget (Advanced
Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), 2019).

**[[The shift away from large-scale public investments]{.mark} has
[constrained the U.S.'s response to climate change]{.mark}. Public
investment remains a crucial component of any program to rapidly
decarbonize the economy, because it is vital to leveraging economies of
scale, solving coordination problems, and operating the economy at full
employment. While a carbon price coupled with environmental regulation
would provide households, firms, and governments with an incentive to
transition away from fossil fuels, public investment is necessary to
rapidly build carbon-free alternatives, and to facilitate a transition
in a just and equitable manner]{.underline}** (Griffith and Calish 2020;
Galvin and Healy, 2020). **[[Public investment is necessary for]{.mark}
[retrofitting buildings, providing green]{.mark} public [transportation,

Studies in 2007, Dr Abdelrahman worked as an Associate Professor of
Sociology at the American University in Cairo, "The Indefatigable

[Capitalism is a system which is constantly reinventing itself, seeking
new frontiers and markets, **adopting new technologies** and creating
new ways of work]{.underline} (Yuill, 2005: 136). In this process, the
skilling and deskilling of the workforce dramatically changes working
conditions and the workers' bargaining position. [[The last quarter of
the 20th century]{.mark}, which was characterised by changing regimes of
production, [saw]{.mark} drastic changes in the working conditions of
millions of workers including **[increased unemployment, rising job
insecurity and the growing withdrawal of social protection
regimes.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[With the transfer of most
manufacturing jobs to developing countries and the expansion of the
service sector, the factory was no longer the focus of scientific
intervention to maintain and improve the productivity of the
indefatigable worker in the West. In this new world]{.mark},
characterised by a series of global financial crises, industrial fatigue
and workplace accidents ceased to be the main concern of the policy and
scientific community]{.underline} (Davies, 2016; Long, 2011). [In their
place [came mental health concerns, burnouts, exhaustion, depression,
anxiety and stressrelated illness that were]{.mark} leading to
increasing lost time and [posing a growing threat to productivity. With
the advent of the new millennium, the effects of mental health issues on
US workers were allegedly costing the economy **\$550 billion
annually**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Mindful Nation UK, 2015). Britain's
Healthiest Workplace initiative, a platform launched in 2013, has shown
that health-related lost productivity as well as 'presenteesim' was
costing the UK economy an estimated £91 billion and costing the NHS at
least £ 8 billion (2019). [[Globally, the WHO (2011) estimated that **by
2030, depression would become the world's largest cause of disability.**
The productive body needed to be refashioned to **survive** the

[**[Limits to Growth gave]{.mark} way [to the proposal for "zero
growth]{.mark}," [and]{.mark} for [a "steady-state economy]{.mark}**"
and "Blueprint for survival." The precursors of **[new ecological
economics unveiled the ineluctable relation]{.mark} [between]{.mark} the
[economic process and the degradation of Nature]{.mark}.** Tis, in turn,
led to acknowledging the need to internalize ecological costs and to
deploy distributive counter-measures to the ecological unbalance
generated by market mechanisms.]{.underline} In his book **The Entropy
Law and the Economic Process**, [Nicholas [**Georgescu-Roegen** (1971)
**disclosed the**]{.mark} fundamental **[connection between economic
growth and the natural limits]{.mark}** set by the second law of
thermodynamics. **the** production **process** generated **by** the
economic **rationality** **that inhabits** the **machinery of the
industrial** revolution **is defined by an impulse to grow or die**,
unlike living beings, who are born, develop and die, and human
populations, which can establish policies to stabilize their growth.
**Economic growth, industrial metabolism, and exosomatic consumption
imply a permanent**ly **growing consumption of natural resources**
(matter and energy), **which** not only **runs up against the limits of
the planet's** provision**, productivity, and renewal** of E. Leff
resources, but becomes degraded in the process of production and
consumption, following the entropy law.]{.underline} Four decades after
the eye-opening book Silent Spring by Rachel Carlson (1962) that
divulged the effects of DDT, ecological destruction has increased
dramatically, accentuating global warming caused by greenhouse gases,
and by the inescapable laws of thermodynamics, which have set in motion
the planet's entropic degradation. the remedies generated by scientific
and technological innovation are difficult to integrate into a
sustainable economic system. the paradigms and policies that since then
have been generated within the emergent geopolitics of "sustainable
development" are showing to be short-lived, because they are not
sustainable (Park et al. 2008); they are not rooted in the
thermodynamic, ecological, symbolic, and cultural conditions of life.
[**[In its]{.mark}** globalizing **[drive, the]{.mark} [economic world
order]{.mark}** that **[is supported by the discourse of "sustainable
development"]{.mark} [has]{.mark}** obscured **[the fundamental problem
of the environmental crisis]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [Rather than
internalizing the ecological conditions for sustainability, the
geopolitics of "sustainable development" ended up commoditizing Nature
and over-economizing the world.]{.underline} "Mechanisms for clean
development" were put in place, alongside economic instruments for
environmental management that established private property rights over
the monetary value of environmental goods and services (Brand/Görg
2008). Natural commons (water, air, the sea, and the atmosphere) have
been progressively privatized, while new market devices have been
created for trading pollution rights (carbon bonuses) and giving a price
to the ecological balance of the planet (carbon ofsetting).

#### Capitalism is unsustainable; capitalists perception of nature makes it impossible for them to regenerate what they've used

**Leff 21** Leff, Deconstructing Capital and Territorializing Life,
Enrique, Professor of Political Ecology at UNAM, p

[[The]{.mark} general **[conditions of production]{.mark}**, understood
as everything that exists [in Nature]{.mark} and society that is not
produced according to the process of value formation and the laws of the
market but rather which establishes the certain necessary conditions for
capitalist production, **s[hould also be redefned in]{.mark}** the
context of extended **[capital reproduction]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In
this sense, ecological conservation principles that provide essential
environmental services for the reproduction of Nature and the survival
of humanity were incorporated into economic policies. [These
socio-environmental conditions include all those activities considered
to be of strategic interest for the State that is unproftable for
capital, such as infrastructure and public services; conservation areas,
and environmental norms for industry, subsidies for basic foodstuffs,
and health services.]{.underline} However, these traditional public
sector activities are being challenged by neoliberal economics through
privatization policies that extend the laws of the market to all
environmental common goods and services, conditioning and reducing the
ecological and cultural conditions of production to the dominating
ontological regime of the economic process---the imperative of the
development of the productive forces driven by capital accumulation, the
potency of technology and the power of the rational---throughout the
planet, from North to South, and East to West. Tus**, [[the strategies
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** [capital and the geopolitics of **[sustainable
development]{.mark}** have been **[focused on the]{.mark}**
re-elaboration---reframing, rephrasing and welding anew---of those
**[conditions for production]{.mark}** that [are]{.mark} most [difcult
for capital]{.mark} to generate and [regenerate,]{.mark} those processes
which are ontologically excluded from and actually exterior to economic
rationality E. Leff 195 due to their nature that rejects being
objectified and quantified]{.underline}. These include qualitative
processes where capital accounting and discount rates can not value time
cycles---the resiliency and productivity of ecosystems; conservation
conditions and regeneration times of natural resources; environmental
services and common goods of the biosphere; health conditions,
environmental quality, the meaning of life; local and global impacts;
trans-generational efects of ecological risks and long-term ecological
processes; the bio-cultural patrimony of the people and their
existential rights. These socio-environmental conditions of production
cannot be absorbed under the theories of a green economy and reduced to
the concept of natural capital without exerting violence on Nature.

#### Capitalism completely destroys nature by prioritizing the benefit of the market

**Leff 21** Leff, Deconstructing Capital and Territorializing Life,
Enrique, Professor of Political Ecology at UNAM, pg 181 - IShone

[**[The capitalist mode of production exploits Nature to the beneft of
the market]{.mark}** and the extraction of surplus value, by disposing
of the potentials of Nature and human beings as objects for economic
expropriation. However, [**despite capital's legacy** **of destruction
and degradation on Nature**, **it has not**]{.mark} yet [**annihilated**
**the**]{.mark} self-organizing and **[productive processes]{.mark}**
emerging **[from]{.mark}** natural **[sources of life]{.mark}** nor the
existential resistance and cultural creativity from the peoples of the
Earth.]{.underline} the productive forces of Nature and the ecological
organization of the biosphere, under the dominance of the destructive
forces of capital, lie there as a potential reserve waiting to be
endowed, embodied and embedded by new productive rationality. If
throughout history men have survived through diverse modes of
appropriation/ transformation of Nature; if capitalism imposed its
accumulative logic as a mode of expropriation/ degradation of Nature;
after the environmental crisis a new era has opened up in the evolution
of life in the planet for the social endowment of Nature: a mode of
extracting matter and energy, of enacting and transforming the
metabolism of the biosphere, respecting the conditions of life in the
planet. Endowing Nature will imply en-knowing Nature: [**[learning to
live with]{.mark}**in **[the conditions]{.mark}** and [**inhabiting
Nature** **in the**]{.mark} immanence of **[life on Earth]{.mark}**.
That will be a turning point in history opening the horizons of
sustainable, meaningful life on this planet.]{.underline}

[[Capitalism has prospered for centuries by exploiting nature, either as
an "inexhaustible" supply of resources to produce commodities, or as a
waste dump. But the earth's ability to endure the destructive processes
of capital is reaching its limit.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Capital's need for constant growth has led to the interruption of a
complex natural cycle that took millions of years to
develop.]{.underline}]{.mark} This has created a rift in the
"metabolism" (to borrow Marx's term) between society and nature.

[[Climate change and the crises of the biological cycles of carbon,
water, phosphorus and nitrogen; the acidification of the oceans; the
accelerated loss of biodiversity; the changes in the quality of soil and
chemical pollution by industry]{.mark}---these are some of the terrible
expressions of a completely unprecedented situation for humanity, namely
the tendency toward the destruction of our natural conditions for
production and reproduction. This destructive tendency is directly
related to the social and material deprivation of hundreds of millions
of people who suffer misery, unemployment and precarious employment,
which capitalism needs to ensure its profitability and
reproduction.]{.underline}

The barbarism represented by the recent fires in the Amazon---which were
the product of incentives for deforestation (and which were intensified
by Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro), the relaxation of
environmental laws and the direct action of large landowners and
ranchers who started the fires---is just another episode in the
continual process of environmental degradation and destruction. The
phenomenon of uncontrolled forest fires is growing more frequent, as
shown by the fires ravaging Siberia and sub-Saharan Africa (which are
more numerous, though less destructive than those in the Amazon), as
well as the fires in California last autumn and in many regions of
Europe. Climate change and the thirst for profit are intensifying them.

habitats and species, it was recognized that biodiversity is crucial to
maintaining functional ecosystems. We sought to continue the debate on
the contradictions between economic growth and biodiversity in the
conservation science literature and thus invite scholars to engage in
reversing the biodiversity crisis through acknowledging the impacts of
economic growth. In the 1970s, a global agenda was set to develop
different milestones related to sustainable development, including
green-blue economic growth, which despite not specifically addressing
biodiversity reinforced the idea that economic development based on
profit is compatible with the planet\'s ecology. Only after biodiversity
loss captured the attention of environmental sciences researchers in the
early 2000s was a global biodiversity agenda implemented. [The agenda
highlights biodiversity conservation as a major international challenge
and [recognizes that the main drivers of biodiversity loss derive from
economic activities.]{.mark}]{.underline} The post-2000 biodiversity
agendas, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the

do not consider the negative impacts of growth-oriented strategies on
biodiversity. [[As a result, global biodiversity conservation priorities
are governed by the economic value of biodiversity and its assumed
contribution to people\'s welfare]{.mark}. A large body of empirical
evidence shows that unlimited economic growth is the main driver of
biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene; thus, we strongly argue for

Introduction

For much of the first half of 2003 world attention from Hong Kong to
Geneva was captured by news of a mysterious but deadly virus, similar to
pneumonia, that was claiming lives in places as distant as Toronto and
Beijing. As accounts of the virus\' growing toll became regular
occurrences by February, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) became
part of the global lexicon. In a matter of months there were around
8,000 infections and over 689 deaths related to SARS. In my hometown,
Toronto, 43 people died of SARS during the outbreaks of 2003.

[The recent outbreaks of SARS in Toronto shone a harsh light on the
inadequacies and outright failures of neo-liberal public health policies
and practices. They also showed clearly the extent to which neo-liberal
governments prioritize business security above the health and social
security of workers. Even more than this, however, the SARS crises
revealed some of the ways in which the [pressures of capitalist social
relations make people ill.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Public health officials first received warnings of SARS in early
February and a full-blown crisis was emerging by March. By late April
Ontario\'s Conservative (Tory) Premier of the day, Ernie Eves, had not
even recalled the legislature, which had been on hiatus since Christmas,
to devise a plan for dealing with the various aspects of the crisis. For
weeks the Conservative plan appeared to consist of little more than
suggestions to 'wash your hands' or 'continue to eat in Chinatown'.
Governments only responded, and even then largely in terms of public
relations, after the embarrassment of the late-April World Heath
Organization (WHO) travel advisory and the threat of losses for tourist
industry owners.

Even worse, the provincial government\'s rush to assure tourists that
the crisis was over following the WTO advisory seems to have played a
major part in a renewed outbreak during the end of May. The nurses\'
unions reported publicly that prior to the second outbreak their
warnings to the government that it was too soon to let up on SARS went
unheeded ([Boyle & Mallan,
2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162428/#bib1); [Diebel,
2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162428/#bib3)).
Clearly public relations, rather than public health, were at the
forefront of Conservative concerns.

[This chapter examines issues of class and poverty in emergence of SARS.
[These issues are also examined in relation to the public response to
SARS in Toronto. Issues of poverty and illness are crucial in addressing
emerging epidemics, especially in the global age in which diseases can
travel the globe in hours rather than years]{.mark}. The chapter begins
with a discussion of the political economy of the emergence of SARS, and
its relation to the spread of the virus. It then discusses issues of
public policy, and particularly neo-liberal cuts to social services and
public spending, that set the stage for the SARS outbreak, influenced
its impact and contributed to the failures of response in
Ontario.]{.underline} Through analysis of the lack of social resources
available to working people in the province and the prioritizing of
corporate, particularly tourism industry, concerns, the chapter examines
how issues of class underpinned public responses to SARS, exacerbating
[problems. The chapter concludes by giving attention to the need for
social solidarity and community mutual aid in a context of emerging
epidemics within capitalist globalization]{.underline} and questions why
diseases and illnesses impacting poor people have received less
attention and fewer resources than those largely impacting members of
the global tourist classes.

#### Empirically proven by Canda during the SARS pandemic

The frantic, if inadequate, attention given to SARS, by both media and
governments, highlights other class-related issues in Canadian health
care. Other recent outbreaks in Toronto, such as tuberculosis, Norwalk
virus and Hepatitis A, have received less attention because there is a
sense among governments that these diseases are confined to poor and
homeless populations and not likely to spread to the population at
large. SARS had such impact because it affected suburbanites, consumers
and, potentially, tourists.

Street nurses, those trained nurses who devote themselves to assisting
homeless and street-involved individuals and tending to their many
health issues, [Crowe and Hardill
(2003)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162428/#bib2) note
that the TB outbreak in Toronto shelters in 2001 was predicted by
front-line health workers as early as 1994; yet the city and province
did nothing to change the conditions -- overcrowding and poor shelter
conditions, lack of affordable housing and community-based programs such
as drop-in centers and unsatisfactory nutrition -- that allow for the
spread of such illnesses. Horribly, three homeless people died of
consumption in Canada\'s richest city in 2001 ([Crowe & Hardill,
2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162428/#bib2)).
Almost 40% of shelter residents have been exposed to TB ([Crowe &
Hardill,
2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162428/#bib2)).

[The conditions that underlie the spread of TB are really the same as
those that underlie the spread of SARS: the insecurity of capitalist
economics which forces people to spend much of their lives working for
wages lest they face the consequences of homelessness and hunger. Many
workers know that they are a paycheck away from being homeless and too
many of us are faced with the decision to pay the rent or feed the kids.
[Lack of access to and control over the necessities of life, which are
owned and controlled by various profit-seeking bosses, and the forced
compulsion to work to survive undermine the capacities of individuals
and communities to make their health a priority.]{.mark}]{.underline}

As [Crowe and Hardill
(2003)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162428/#bib2) affirm,
'food, income, safety and housing protect people\'s health. Simply
stated, housing is protection from disease'. A guaranteed income might
provide the same protection. Clearly a broad-based program for community
health would include not only increased funding for public health
departments, but also more affordable housing, improved conditions in
shelters, nutrition programs, a minimum wage increase to a living wage
level and increased welfare rates (or better a guaranteed income).

[SARS, and the social response to it, brought together many of these
crucial issues. It showed fundamentally and often starkly that emerging
epidemics are about political economy as much as anything. [SARS brought
to the fore relations of inequality, power, poverty, democracy and
governance and the distribution of resources within capitalist societies
such as Canada in the global period. It showed that relations of power
and inequality are central in giving rise to epidemics but also in
inhibiting the capacities of people, such as health care workers, to
respond adequately, despite their often heroic efforts.]{.mark} Even
advanced health care systems are imperiled by persistent disparities in
wealth and access to resources and decision-making processes. These are
lessons that must still be learned and acted upon in light of ongoing
threats of emerging epidemics in the current period. [As more people are
negatively impacted through economic crisis, and as economic 'recovery'
programs retrench neo-liberal policies and re-distribute public
resources to private capital, the lessons of SARS, and its social
underpinnings, press even more forcefully upon us.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Capitalism helped Covid-19 develop into the worst pandemic in over a century -- many things has been sacrificed for the sole interest of business

a Pandemic]{.underline}**, 1.3 Further Impact of Globalization, Cham:

**[In the context of the contemporary globalised economy and driven by a
wide variety of neoliberal economic theories, [the]{.mark}se [disastrous
consequences of]{.mark} "pure" or "unbri- dled" [capitalism
have]{.mark}, in recent decades, [been further accentuated and amplified
to extreme proportions]{.mark}.93]{.underline}**

**[E.g., in the period 1989--1991, the neoliberal world order that had
emerged in the 1980s under the influence of neoliberal doctrines was
reinforced by the collapse of the communist system in Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union.94 More precisely, the collapse of the communist system
in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union ended much of the resistance,
especially on an economic and political level, to the power of
capitalism. Since then, the collapse of the communist economies has even
been used as a further argument that there is no alternative to the free
market.95 As a result, the belief in the free market would become ever
more fanatical than in previous centuries, leading to the idea that the
free market is an absolute condition for a free society and for
individual and collective progress. In the 1990s, these influences paved
the way for an invisible "globalisation" of the capitalist economic
system. This led to a continuous increase in the level of
interconnection between countries at a socio-economic level,
characterised by an increase in the international traffic of goods,
services, capital and labour (thus people).96 The so-called principles
of "liberalisation" and "deregulation" hereby became the guiding
principles of public policy in almost all countries of the
world.97]{.underline}**

**[Since (economic) neoliberalism managed to make capitalism the
dominant eco- nomic system on Earth, [the polluting effect of economic
activities has]{.mark} nowadays even [taken on a global dimension
(]{.mark}with so-called "new economies" even having made claims in the
recent past to be as entitled to pollute the world as the Western
countries have done in the past).98]{.underline}**

**[As a result, during the past three ages, [the protection of the
global ecosystem]{.mark}, the only "habitat" of the human species and
all other known living creatures, [has been increasingly sacrificed to
the capitalist principle of profit-making]{.mark}. Similarly, [public
health has also been sacrificed to the sole interests of
business]{.mark}, with the working methods of the pharmaceutical
industry as a clear example.99 (Cf. Sect. 9.2)]{.underline}**

This contribution examines **[[the role of capitalism in anti-American
terrorism]{.mark}. It uses two theoretical frameworks, both of which
contrast the pacifying effects of higher levels of capitalist
development with the potentially destabiliz ing effects of a transition
towards capitalism, but differ with respect to their definition of
capitalism, capitalism\'s interaction with anti-American terrorism, and
its empirical operationalization. Using panel data for 149 countries
between 1970 and 2007 and providing further system-level time-series
evidence, this contribution finds [no support for]{.mark} hypotheses
derived from the classical [capitalist peace literature]{.mark}. There
is [no evidence that anti-American terrorism increases]{.mark} [with
external economic liberalization or that it decreases with higher levels
of economic openness]{.mark}. By contrast, hypotheses derived from
economic norms theory find empirical support. [Conceptualizing
capitalism as social market-capitalism,]{.mark}]{.underline}** this
article finds that higher levels of market-capitalism are associated
with less anti-American terrorism, while the process of marketization
fuels it. Consistent with expectations from economic norms theory, the
destabilizing effects of the marketization process may stem from the
violent opposition of antimarket interest groups that have benefited
from the pre-market order to the economic-cultural change initiated by a
transition towards a market economy. [These interest [groups
deliberately target the USA]{.mark} [as]{.mark} the main proponent of
[market-capitalism]{.mark}, globalization, and modernity, where
anti-American terrorism serves the purpose of consolidating their
societal position, rolling back pro-market reforms and limiting the
perceived Americanization of their communities.]{.underline} This
contribution\'s findings suggest that the USA may ultimately become a
less likely target of transnational terrorism through the establishment
of market economies, but should not disregard the disruptive economic
cultural effects of marketization process in non-market economies.
Anti-American terrorism is an important subset of trans national
terrorist activity.1 As shown in Figure 1, terror ism directed against
US interests was a constant threat between 1970 and 2007.2 During this
time period the [[USA was the target of terrorist
groups]{.mark}]{.underline} with various ideological profiles hailing
from both Western countries and the developing world. For instance[,
[US]{.mark} interests were [attacked by]{.mark}]{.underline} the

[[Philippine Moro Islamic Liberation Front]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the
nationalist-separatist [[Popular Front for the Lib eration of
Palestine]{.underline}]{.mark} (LaFree, Yang & Crenshaw, 2009). Shortly
after the attacks of 11 September 2001 (9/11), US [President George W
[Bush]{.mark}]{.underline} (2001 ) asked: [[\'Why do]{.mark} they \[i.e.

#### Capitalism causes money to become the purpose of our lives

Therefore once a society follows the path of the technocratic paradigm -
as Pope Francis says - it will be inexorably transformed into a
technological society dedicated to values such as efficiency, expansion
of power and control over nature, as had happened with industrialization
phenomenon. Actually, this conception of technology functions in the
same way as **[[neoliberal]{.mark} mainstream
[economics]{.mark}]{.underline}** (the so called invisible hand of the
market, the individual permanent search for enrichment) and growth as
the most obvious way to measure development. Hence, technology ceases to
be an instrument and becomes the centre of our lives, which
**[[is]{.mark} analogous to [viewing money as the]{.mark} main [purpose
of our lives]{.mark}. Normally one may believe that money is a neutral
instrument of our objectives in life, but on closer examination it is
clear that for a lot of people making money has become the main purpose
of life. Even though [there are]{.mark} clearly [things]{.mark}
[money]{.mark} [can]{.mark}no[t]{.mark} [buy]{.mark} (such as the
recognition of others, or love and happiness),
[people]{.mark}]{.underline}** do **[[try]{.mark} to buy
them]{.underline}** constantly, **[[with]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[Those]{.mark} [who base their]{.mark} whole [lives on]{.mark} the

#### Accumulation for the sake of accumulation entrenches us in a cycle of violence, exploitation, and eventually extinction

**Pillay '18** \[Devan; 2018; Former trade unionist, is Associate

PURSUIT OF 'HAPPINESS'," Ch. 7, p. 149-151\] SPark

**[[The]{.mark}]{.underline}** GDP **[[paradigm is based on the
assumption of continuous economic growth as an end]{.mark} in
itself]{.underline}**. This form of economic development arose with
industrial capitalism and its treadmills of production and consumption,
which are essential to the system's forward momentum.2 Because this has
brought about considerable improvements in the material conditions of
living of vast numbers of people on Earth, **[it is deeply entrenched in
modern society, which marvels at its creative and innovative powers.
However, [it also has immense destructive powers]{.mark}, [characterised
by massive social inequality]{.mark}, [dispossession]{.mark} from the
land, [homelessness]{.mark} and [slummification]{.mark}, widespread
[poverty]{.mark} [and environmental degradation on a global
scale]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

In other words, as Marx observed, industrial capitalism simultaneously
develops and destroys. **[[The GDP metric]{.mark} measures some of its
economic 'goods', but [omits the socio-economic and environmental
'bads'.]{.mark}]{.underline}** For example, as Lorenzo Fioramonti (2013)
argues, **[social and physical [diseases caused by unfettered capitalist
growth, like crime and pollution, result in increased home security or
medical expenses, which is recorded as a positive GDP increase - thus
grossly distorting the real well-being of a
nation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. More expansive indices, such as the
United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Index, give a
better indication of well-being but still have at their core the GDP
metric. Indeed, GDP has become a talisman of the growth paradigm -
mesmerising whole nations and peoples into a seductive vortex that
serves the interests of Capital3 as an end in itself.

In what Antonio Gramsci (1982) called a process of 'hegemony',4 the
paradigm is maintained by a variety of social mechanisms and
institutions that pervade society. **[Capitalism has brought about a
global hegemonic power bloc]{.underline}**5 **[consisting of both
economic and political or state elites]{.underline}** - what Ralph
Miliband (1988), drawing on C. Wright Mills, calls 'power elites', who
form the apex of the dominant class.6 **[While th[ese power elites
compete with each other in various ways, often aggressively and
sometimes violently]{.mark}]{.underline}** (both amongst themselves at
the national level and between national elites at the global level, such
as in geopolitical and trade competition), **[they are
united]{.underline}** by their common interest **[in
maintaining]{.underline}** the essential features of **[the growth
paradigm]{.underline}**, or what Marx called the accumulation imperative
of capitalism. **[The [accumulation of profit has no intrinsic morality
other than to recreate the conditions for further accumulation]{.mark}.
As such, [capital usually contradicts societal]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(in particular working-class) **[[interests]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
nature, **[[through]{.underline}]{.mark}** various processes of
**[[dispossession, exploitation and domination]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
The power elite usually makes compromises (directly or through the
state) only when faced with resistance of various kinds. This includes
struggles for a greater share of the social surplus (higher wages and
better working conditions, a social wage), resistance to dispossession
of the commons (land and other public assets), resistance to
environmental degradation and campaigns for greater democratic
participation.

In other words, **[capitalism has what Samir Amin]{.underline}** (2004)
**[calls a growth]{.underline}** or '**[[liberal
virus'7]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[that operates within the logic of
[accumulation for the sake of accumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This
is based on its inner drive towards compound growth (Harvey 2014) that
demands maximum market liberalisation, as it scans the globe (including
the oceans, deeper into the Earth, as well as within our bodies, and
outer space) for investment opportunities. A key dimension to this is
the system's dependence on fossil fuels, what Elmar Altvatar (2007)
calls 'fossil capitalism'. **[This [generates a number of
crises]{.mark}]{.underline}** on a **[continuous basis, at social and
natural levels]{.underline}**.

Briefly, **[the social crises involve the [increasing exploitation of
workers]{.mark}]{.underline}** through the informalisation of work,
**[[lower]{.mark} real [wages]{.mark}]{.underline}**, a **[declining
social wage]{.underline}**, [**[rising unemployment]{.underline}**,
**[privatisation of the commons]{.underline}**]{.mark} such as public
land and services, and **[[rising]{.mark} global
[inequality]{.mark}]{.underline}** within and between countries. Almost
**[[half the world does not have enough to eat, while less than one per
cent of humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}** (based mainly but not
exclusively in the north) **[[possesses most of the
Earth's]{.underline}]{.mark}** material
**[[wealth]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Oxfam 2014; Piketty 2014). This
usually **[fuels social instability]{.underline}**, through rising crime
and political upheavals (including terrorism), which tends to further
expand the security state on global and national levels, **[[leading to
a vicious cycle]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[[The social crisis is accompanied by ecological
crises]{.underline}]{.mark}** that can be grouped under three headings:
the **[depletion of resources]{.underline}** (in particular oil, which
runs the system, but also rain forests and fresh-water sources, amongst
others); **[pollution]{.underline}** (including carbon emissions and
their impact on climate change, as well as increasing waste and other
industrial and vehicle pollutants that affect public health); **[and
declining biodiversity]{.underline}** (where animals and plants become
extinct, with grave threats to the delicate ecosystem). **[[This can
bring human society to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the precipice, where it
faces **[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Magdoff & Foster 2011).

**[Accumulate, accumulate! That is Moses and the
prophets!\'\"]{.underline}** This quotation from Marx\'s Capital
concisely summarizes the thesis that **[[capitalism]{.mark} - through
the competitive [compulsion to accumulate]{.mark} - is fundamentally
[organized around]{.mark} competitive [expansion, growth, and
intensification]{.mark} and can [only function in this
way]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In classical economics, accumulation (from
the Latin accumulare, \`to heap up\'), describes the continuous process
of adding value to capital**. [Value is created through the metabolic
interaction with nature in the form of work, and then exploited by the
property-owning classes who can extract surplus value by selling the
finished commodity.]{.underline}** In a competitive market system, this
surplus value must largely be reinvested as capital (machinery,
resources, labour), thus leading to expansion and the continued expanded
reproduction of capital at ever-higher levels. **[As we explain further
below, this process of [accumulation materializes as growth]{.mark}, but
also [leads to systemic crises]{.mark} and \'contradictions\'
([ecological]{.mark}, financial, [social, political]{.mark},
etc.)]{.underline}** \"0 As feminist and Global South critics emphasize,
beyond the exploitation in the workplace (the \'hidden abode of
production, to use Marx\'s famous term), **[capitalism is also
[fundamentally dependent on]{.mark} appropriation and the [continuous
colonization]{.mark} of a non-capitalist outside. This process of
appropriating the non-capitalist \'outside, which following Rosa
Luxemburg has been theorized as Landnahme (land grabbing), can be
understood geographically (as colonialism), socially (as reproduction
work, spheres of life not yet commodified), and in relation to
nature]{.underline}**.8\' The crises resulting from this double dynamic
of exploitation and appropriation inherent to the process of economic
growth - so goes the core argument of the critique of capitalism -
cannot be understood nor overcome without undoing the systemic logic and
associated social relations of domination and exploitation of capitalist
accumulation.\" The critique of capitalism is as old as capitalism
itself. Even if, in parts of the degrowth discussion, the critique of
capitalism is ignored, we consider it essential to understanding the
growth society and to the possibility of changing it. The critique of
growth, we argue, must also include a critique of capitalist
accumulation. In the words of Elmar Altvater (who himself modified Max
Horkheimer\'s statement about the connection between capitalism and
fascism): \'They who will not speak of the accumulation of capital shall
remain silent about growth:\" From a degrowth perspective, growth can be
analysed as a neces-sary consequence, but also as a condition, of
capitalist accumulation. In addition to the critique of consumption and
the external limits of growth, production and the mode of production
must also be central to a critique of growth. This includes
**[capitalism\'s tendency to enter into crises - and its continuous
overcoming of them through transformations of the mode of production and
further expansion to new frontiers - as well as class conflicts and the
social institutions (property, corporations, banks, nation-states, the
military, monopolies) involved in accumulation and growth
processes]{.underline}**. Since the limits of growth are also the limits
of capitalism (which dynamically stabilizes itself through growth), it
is not just economic growth that is under consideration but the
capitalist system as such. For, without growth, **[capitalism [threatens
to]{.mark} further [deteriorate into]{.mark} a refeudalized, [miserable,
unequal]{.mark}, and [authoritarian system]{.mark} marked by
strengthened borders and conflicts over resources.]{.underline}** From
the point of view of this criticism, degrowth necessarily also means
post-capitalism and is therefore closely aligned with anti-capitalist
movements and eco-socialism in particular.\"

Continuous accumulation process According to Marx, capitalism is a
social structure and economic system which, first, is driven by capital
being invested with the aim of earning more money, and in which, second,
this accumulation dynamic - based on private ownership of the means of
production, wage labour, and competitive markets - has a decisive
influence on society. This is often explained using the formula M-C-M\'
(or: money-commodities-more money). Capitalists invest capital in
commodities such as machinery, raw materials, and energy, but also in
labour. The \'double character\' of wage labour in capitalism creates a
product that not only has a concrete use value, but also an abstract
exchange value. Based on the exchange value, the commodity is worth more
than the capital invested and is sold again on markets. This means that
the amount of money (M) initially used is converted into a larger amount
of money (M\') through a metabolic exchange with nature and commodified
work (that is, wage labour) that produces commodities (C).\" If this
were the whole story, capitalism would simply involve surplus being
consumed privately or spent socially - whether through building palaces
or churches or holding large feasts or parades. **[However, because of
market competition, the productive forces moving forward through
technological improvements, and the competitive need to accumulate
capital, a large part of the profits must be reinvested into acquiring
more capital. This creates a continuous accumulation process.\" The fact
that the generated surplus value is constantly reinvested in the
purchase of better and more modern machines, more or cheaper materials,
or in the employment of more or more productive workers is not the
result of the individual greed of the capitalist.]{.underline}** Due to
the competition for market shares and advances in productivity,
investing is not an arbitrary decision, but a constraint that restricts
all actions of owners of capital and dominates the entire economic
system. The tremendous increase in productivity under capitalism goes
back to this principle of competition - because those who lag behind in
the pursuit of extra profits through better production methods,
technical progress, or more efficient organization of work lose market
share to the competition, lack the resources for updating their
machinery to the newest standards, and thus sooner or later lose the
basis of their business. The pressure on society as a whole to grow
production also follows from this dynamic of accumulation. If there is
no growth, average capitalists are stuck with unrealized values, unsold
goods lose their exchange value, investments decline, and the entire
supply chain slows or even comes to a standstill. And, since human life
reproduces itself in capitalism through markets - on which provisioning
basic necessities depends - **[[every capitalist crisis is also a social
crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline}**\" As we discuss below, this capitalist
process of accumulation is fundamentally based on inequality,
domination, and various forms of social rule. The capitalist system has
to be analysed as a social relationship, including class, racial, and
gender relations, the post-colonial global world system, and a form of
politics comprising states and parties. And capitalism has to be
analysed as a biophysical system as well.\'

Growth is the materialization of accumulation The capitalist economy is
defined by the drive towards accumulation. Economic growth is the
materialization of this process - a materialization that is biophysical
and ecological as much as it is social, as we explored in chapter 2.
Economic growth is the consequence of the compulsion to make a profit, a
process resulting from accumulation. But economic growth is also a
condition of accumulation - without growth and the related biophysical
and social processes there can be no accumulation.\" **[Capital is
necessarily excessive; [it does not know boundaries]{.mark}; its [only
drive is to grow itself]{.mark} - which is characterized by the fact
that it only refers to itself as quantity. [People\'s needs play]{.mark}
only a [subordinate role]{.mark}: in exchange value-oriented production
needs must be taken into account to the extent that they allow for
meeting the conditions of extended production and reproduction of
capital, and no more than that.\"]{.underline}** That is, without
workers being in a sufficiently healthy state to work, and without
consumers being able and having the money to consume, capitalist
accumulation would fail either to be profitable or to sell commodities,
each of which is an essential condition of the continued process of
accumulation and the capture of surplus value. The economy is thus
driven by the pursuit of profits. Within this \`monetary production
economy, growth results from two interlinked but different forms of
investments, both of which aim at expanding the capacity to produce and
accumulate: **[\'Expansion can be the simple production of more
machines, materials and labour power or this expansion can be the
production of new forms of machines, materials and labour power, and the
design of new, hitherto non-existent commodity forms:\" While both
extensive and intensive investments affect growth, it is in particular
[accumulation]{.mark} based on intensive investments that increases
productivity and [drives]{.mark} ever-expanding and changing consumer
[markets and permanently \'improving\' products]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(for which advertisement creates the necessary demand). From the
labour-centric, productivist perspective it is this latter drive which
gives a historically \'progressive direction to capitalism. It is this
logic of accumulation, driven by competition, which, following the rules
of capitalism\'s development, brings about a perma-nent revolution of
all conditions, has unfolded a previously unknown development of
productive forces, and is expanding into ever-growing regions of the
world but also into new areas of society. Many - including the
productivist currents within the (Marxist) left - hope that capitalism
will, through technical innovation, develop the productive forces to
make a liberated, post-capitalist society possible.\" But it is also
this dynamic of accumulation that underlies the crisis-like nature of
capitalism, as we explore below.

**[Growth as perpetual crisis]{.underline}** In a famous passage of
Capital, Marx, writing about the continuous development of the means of
production in agriculture and industry through innovation, technology,
and the divide between city and coun-tryside, also discussed what has
later been termed the \'metabolic rift:

Capitalist production collects the population together in great centres,
and causes the urban population to achieve an ever-growing
preponderance. This has two results. On the one hand it concentrates the
historical motive force of society; on the other hand, it disturbs the
metabolic interaction between man and the earth, i.e., it prevents the
return to the soil of its constituent elements consumed by man in the
form of food and clothing; hence it hinders the operation of the eternal
natural condition for the lasting fertility of the soil \... But by
destroying the circumstances surrounding that metabolism \... it compels
its systematic restoration as a regulative law of social production, and
in a form adequate to the full development of the human race \... All
progress in capitalist agriculture is a progress in the art, not only of
robbing the worker, but of robbing the soil; all progress in increasing
the fertility of the soil for a given time is a progress toward ruining
the more long-lasting sources of that fertility \... **[Capitalist
production, therefore, only develops the techniques and the degree of
combination of the social process of production by simultaneously
[undermining the original sources of all wealth - the soil and the
worker]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.\"]{.mark}

Moreover, **[[the]{.mark} current [false]{.mark} ideological [belief in
infinite growth]{.mark} partly originates in the]{.underline}** modern
philosophical tendency **[to]{.underline}** regard technology as a
neutral phenomenon that need **[[not question]{.mark} the values applied
or [the end it serves]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The trauma of Einstein
when he realized the manner in which the Pentagon was going to use the
atomic bomb - largely made possible due to his discoveries - by
launching it on Hiroshima and Nagasaki illustrates this ethical issue
very well. Hence, the Pope's 'technocratic paradigm' takes on precisely
that supposedly neutral position of the technocrats of the economy in
the face of social and environmental problems, in which the purpose of
economic activity - serving human beings for the satisfaction of their
basic needs - is not promoted and still less achieved.
**[[Competitiveness guides]{.mark} the performance of
[entrepreneurs]{.mark} seeking [to maximize]{.mark} capital [gain on
pain of bankruptcy and market disappearance]{.mark}. As a result,
[capitalist economy functions]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the sake of [growth
without values or purposes]{.mark}, as if it were [a cyclist who does
n]{.mark}o[t]{.mark} [know where he is going but]{.mark} must [keep
pedalling because if he stops]{.mark} the bike loses [it]{.mark}s
balance and [falls]{.mark}. [But]{.mark} obviously, if the [cyclist does
not know where he is going]{.mark}, he [risks falling into an
abyss.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Viewing growth and accumulation as an end causes a litany of impacts

Thus, **[[if]{.underline}]{.mark}** the ways in which **[[a capitalist
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}** functions **[[can be explained by]{.mark}
a competitive [desire to maintain]{.mark} an economic [activity whose
purposes]{.mark}]{.underline}** (apart from the accumulation of capital
and the distribution of profits to the shareholders of large companies)
**[[are n]{.mark}o[t]{.mark} [known]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[there is
a]{.mark} clear [necessity to reform]{.mark} the current world
economy]{.underline}**, which will be discussed further on in this book.
For instance, if we selected some figures from world economic data and
tried using them to assess global economic growth (guided by
competitiveness and capital accumulation) using the classic category of
the increase in per capita income at national level and on a global
scale,15 according to experts we would find that personal income has
increased from US \$3,305 in 1960 to US \$9,472 per capita in 2010 to
reach US \$14,000 in 2017 (Sachs 2017). From an axiological point of
view (implicitly because economy technocrats do not base their decisions
on ethical judgements), this would be considered something 'good' or
'positive'. However, that would be an erroneous and incomplete
(reductionist) perception because **[from the perspective of natural
ecosystems or social welfare, in a world where nature is affected by
waste and pollution as well as concentration of wealth with the
consequent inequality, [the increase in growth]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(GDP) and per capita income **[[does n]{.mark}o[t]{.mark}]{.underline}**
appear to **[[have]{.mark} those [positive
connotations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is because **[[poverty]{.mark}
and inequality [result in a permanent]{.mark} social [crisis at world
level]{.mark}, as demonstrated by the [massive increase in
migratory]{.mark} [flows]{.mark}, the [proliferation of armed
conflict]{.mark}, the [intensification in]{.mark} the number of refugees
and [social turmoil]{.mark}, the [surge of terrorism]{.mark}, [organized
crime]{.mark} and the like]{.underline}**.16 It is clear from the pie

[Roger W. Ferguson Jr.](https://www.cfr.org/expert/roger-w-ferguson-jr),
Steven A. Tananbaum distinguished fellow for international economics at
CFR, leads a conversation on the future of capitalism. 

FASKIANOS: Welcome to today's Winter/Spring 2022 CFR Academic Webinar
Series. I'm Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and
Outreach at CFR.

Today's discussion is on the record, and the video and transcript will
be available on our website, CFR.org/academic. As always, CFR takes no
institutional positions on matters of policy.

We're delighted to have Roger Ferguson Jr. with us to talk about the
future of capitalism. Roger Ferguson is CFR's Steven A. Tananbaum
distinguished fellow for international economics. Previously, he served
as president and CEO of TIAA, and before that he was head of financial
services for Swiss Re and chairman of Swiss Re America Holding
Corporation.

He is the former vice chairman of the board of governors of the U.S.
Federal Reserve System, and he currently serves on the board of several
corporations and organizations, as a fellow of the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences, and is an advisor with various private fintech
companies.

So, Dr. Ferguson, thank you very much for being with us today to talk
about the future of capitalism, and it is kind of astonishing that we
are talking about the future of capitalism. Can you talk about this area
and what you see the strengths are and weaknesses as well?

FERGUSON: So thank you very much, and I'm going to actually start with a
quote. I think this is a quote from 1938 that roughly captures why we
are talking about the future of capitalism. So this was from FDR, a
famous U.S. president. In 1938, he said, "Democracy has disappeared in
several other great nations, not because the people of those nations
disliked democracy"---or you might say capitalism---"but because they
had grown tired of unemployment and insecurity, of seeing their children
hungry while they sat helpless in the face of government confusion and
government weakness through lack of leadership in government."

Now, that is a strong statement. It is not exactly where we are today.
But there are a few points here that are relevant and resonant with
where we are today. So the reason that we're looking at and talking
about this question of the future of capitalism is that there are many
surveys that suggest that young people, in particular, are not sure that
capitalism is the system that they want to use to organize their
economic life.

We know that capitalism has been very successful in many ways. It has
brought, literally, hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people
around the world out of abject poverty. It has created some of the most
iconic and successful companies that the world has ever known. We've
seen dramatic transformations in our lives in terms of our ability to do
everyday tasks using smart phones, and they've only been around twenty
years or so. All these things are the outcome of a capitalist system
that is very robust, that has created new entities, that has allowed
other things to grow---business, et cetera.

[Having said that, for many people, [capitalism is still a bit of an
enigma]{.mark}. They look around and they observe, at least here in the
United States, that income has been gradually rising and
[inequality,]{.mark} starting, roughly, in the mid-1970s. They've seen
very [unexpected crises]{.mark} here [in the U.S. and in other countries
emanating from mysterious and misunderstood financial tools]{.mark} such
as subprime mortgages.]{.underline}

[They see longer-term challenges for many people around [health
inequitie]{.mark}s, which became very clear during the COVID-19 crisis
that is still with us in some ways. And, obviously, there are for many
people, [the ongoing challenge of climate change with very extreme
weather]{.mark}, and we've experienced that as well.]{.underline}

[And so while [capitalism is, I]{.mark} think, really recognized as the
organizing force that has brought many people out of poverty, allowed
new tools, new capabilities, a very comfortable lifestyle for many, it's
also [seen as,]{.mark} perhaps, not doing everything it's supposed to if
you have [increasing income inequality, increasing wealth inequality,
and you look and see health inequalities and different outcomes]{.mark},
that they guess maybe the system should be somewhat better.]{.underline}

The second point I'd make is, for me, it's really quite ironic because I
grew up at a time when there was conflict between capitalism and
communism, and then in late 1980s, early 1990s, communism disappeared.
The Soviet Union fell apart. And since that time, capitalism is the way
that almost all societies have organized themselves.

In the United States, we have capitalism that is regulated market
capitalism, and Europe tends to be the kind of capitalism that leans a
bit more towards social democratic norms. In Japan, there's a kind of
collective capitalism.

Even China, sometimes called communist China---when I was growing up
called Red China---under Deng Xiaoping. He had this famous phrase, "It
doesn't matter if the cat is black or white as long as it catches a
mouse," and people took that to be a dramatic move towards a capitalist
kind of system, even in communist China.

[And so capitalism, for a period of time, was and still is the dominant
way of organizing all---almost all of the major economies of the world.
There are a few outliers. But the major economies have different
versions of capitalism. There are five or six versions of capitalism.
And now, suddenly, here we are in 2020, 2021, 2022, and we had an
election in the United States when some of the candidates were talking
about socialism. We see in China a reversion back to some skepticism
about the kind of capitalism they had and the great wealth inequality
that resulted. [We see other surveys that suggest people around the
world are less enamored of capitalism.]{.mark}]{.underline}

So it would seem to me a very important topic to say, well, what is the
future capitalism? The system that was the dominant system in the world
for, roughly, thirty years is under question in almost every location
and why is that? And so, that is what we're looking at.

Now, I know that we sent out some readings to the individuals who are
joining us here---the academics, the students from around the
country---and if you look at those readings you'll see that we don't
really know the answers yet.

#### Cap causes inequalities 

**Cudd**, 20**15** (Ann, American philosopher. "Is Capitalism Good for
Women?" Journal of Business Ethics.
<https://www-jstor-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/stable/24702827?sid=primo&seq=1>
///MF)

In a recent book (Cudd and Holmstrom 2011), I argued that capitalism has
brought about great changes in the quality and length of human life in
the twentieth century: the income takeoff (the vast increase of per
capita income of developed nations), the health transition (raising the
life expectancy by upwards of 50 years), and the fertility transition
(from an average of 6 children per woman to around 2). In this paper, I
delve further into the question of whether capitalism is good for women.
[[A major problem with capitalism is that it increases inequality, which
is especially harmful to women and other vulnerable groups. Capitalism
increases economic inequality in the first instance, but this in turn
tends to create political and social inequalities. Inequality,]{.mark} I
agree, [needs to be controlled if capitalism is to be progressive and
defensible]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} I defend such a controlled
capitalism in two ways that are particularly relevant to feminism as a
progressive social movement for human freedom. First, capitalism
promotes innovation: it promotes technical innovation that tends to
improve quality and length of life for everyone, but particularly for
women. But more importantly for the feminist defense of capitalism, it
promotes social innovation, in particular the destruction of harmful,
patriarchal traditions. Thus, the second defense I will make of
capitalism is that it opposes tradition fetishism and reduces the
oppression of traditional societies that impose hierarchies of gender
and case.

#### Inequality is inevitable in capitalism -- the system must be reformed

**Manish & Miller 21** (G. P. Manish is an Assistant Professor of
Economics in the Sorrell College of Business and a member of the Manuel
H. Johnson Center of Political Economy at Troy University, Stephen C.
Miller is the Adams Bibby Chair of Free Enterprise and an Associate
Professor of Economics in the Manuel H. Johnson Center for Political
Economy at Troy University; [Capitalism and Inequality: The Role of
State and Market]{.underline}, 1 Capitalism, cronyism, and inequality,
Taylor & Francis Group, 2020, pg.20//JL)

**[A second view is that [inequality in capitalist economies is due to
the economic and political elite conspiring to control the political
system for their benefit]{.mark}, so the rules under which people
interact are biased to favor the wellconnected few at the expense of the
general public. Inequality is a product of the political system. This
view, which refers to the system as crony capitalism or corporatism
among other names, has adherents throughout the political spectrum, from
political left to political right, and there is substantial support for
this view in the academic literature in economics, political science,
and sociology. Both of these views point toward normative policy
recommendations, but different ones. [If the private ownership of the
means of production that characterizes capitalism]{.mark} inherently
[generates increasing inequality]{.mark}, and if capitalism assigns
ownership of the means of production inequitably, [then there is an
equity argument that the capitalist system should be reformed]{.mark}.
[If government policy creates inequality]{.mark} because government
power is controlled by elites who can design policy for their benefit at
the expense of the masses, [the political system rather than the
economic system should be reformed]{.mark}. The academic literature,
discussed in more detail by Holcombe (2015), offers substantial support
for this second view -- that inequality is generated as a product of the
political process -- and Nader (2015) notes strong support for this
viewpoint throughout the left-- right political spectrum. Despite
agreement that this is a problem, the political left and right differ on
how it should be remedied. The left argues that more government
oversight over those with economic power is the solution, whereas the
right argues that government interference with the economy is the cause
of the problem and the remedy is less government, not more. [Inequality
is inevitable in a system that compensates people in proportion to the
value they create for others]{.mark}, as the marginal productivity
theory of income concludes. Even if people are compensated in proportion
to the value they create for others, some will normatively conclude that
income redistribution is desirable. Rawls (1971) is an example. The two
views discussed here fall into a different category, however, because
both argue that inequality arises because of inherently unfair
procedures. One view argues that the private ownership of the means of
production generates increasing inequality, and that ownership of the
means of production is not determined fairly. The other view argues that
the elite control the political process and design the rules of the game
so that the economic system benefits them at the expense of the masses.
In either case, the inequality created by capitalism is unjust.
[Regardless of whether inequality is the result of some people owning
land]{.mark} (Ricardo), [or institutions that unfairly give some
ownership of capital]{.mark} (Marx, Piketty), [or that the rules are
slanted to favor some over others]{.mark} (Marx and Engels, Stiglitz,
Stockman), [inequality under capitalism is unjust]{.mark}. What are the
policy alternatives?]{.underline}**

#### The worker is subjected to the modes of production but often with below standards living, poverty conditions, and is often never paid right

**Leff 21** Leff, Deconstructing Capital and Territorializing Life,
Enrique, Professor of Political Ecology at UNAM, pg 148-149 - IShone

What these citations of Marx disclose goes well beyond the fact that
non-seasonal and not-working time that constitute conditions of the
production process and for the reproduction of agricultural labor power
is not adequately valued in the theory of value. They also reveal---and
this is the crucial point of debate that poses the environmental
question to Marxism---that the natural processes involved in the
production of E. Leff commodities, in the value of the labor force in
general and in the reproduction of peasants' labor force in particular,
are not valued. the problem is crystal clear: [[Nature contributes to
production,]{.underline}]{.mark} [but only socially necessary labor
time---the labor-time necessary for production, and consequently for the
reproduction of labor force---determined by technological progress,
contributes to value formation and the establishment of the rate of
surplus value! **[the problem does not lie only in the fact that labor
time fails to coincide with production time]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but
more fundamentally in the fact that neither Nature's contribution to
production nor the destructive effects of production on Nature is
valued. [[While the]{.mark} poor [peasant survives through the]{.mark}
articulation of [modes of production]{.mark}---[many times in]{.mark}
extreme conditions of [poverty as capital **does not pay**]{.mark} **for
dignified[, just]{.mark}, and egalitarian standards of living in the
reproduction of its needed labor power**]{.underline}---[Nature does not
get paid at all for its contribution to the overall productivity of
capitalist agriculture, nor to the global economy]{.underline}. Simply
stated, Nature has been externalized by the economy; Nature contributes
to production but does not determine value, not in the way that the
concept of value and surplus value theory are structured in Marxist
theory of value

#### Cap is the root cause/causes poverty 

**VAP**, **no date** (VAP = Volunteering Against Poverty. "Introduction
Capitalism: the root cause of global poverty"
[http://www.ifm-sei.org/files/up/capitalism_vap.pdf
///](http://www.ifm-sei.org/files/up/capitalism_vap.pdf%20///) MF)

[[Capitalism: The root cause of global poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Poverty is the biggest challenge of our time]{.mark}. Millions of
people are denied access to resources and opportunities, impacting
severely on their wellbeing and excluding them from full participation
in society. [The gap between rich and poor is widening rapidly, with
some groups, such as young people and women, disproportionately
affected.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}Poverty is often invisible,
those living in poverty are ashamed to talk about it or lack the means
to ensure their voices are heard. The Volunteering Against Poverty
project aims to give the invisible a voice and challenge people to
contribute to social change, emphasising that poverty is not caused by
the poor, and individuals alone cannot be held responsible for the
situations they find themselves in.

'Someone must be choosing to let others live in poverty'.

[[The VAP group discussed the causes and consequences of poverty at
length, finding that they always came back to one root cause: global
capitalism. The capitalist system is held up by the rich and powerful
who benefit from its maintenance resulting in increasing inequality and
poverty]{.underline}]{.mark}. Connie from Denmark, portrayed in the
documentary, put this in strong words: "We have enough money in Denmark,
so someone must be choosing to let others live in poverty. This is
something I do not understand". The group agreed on the following
statement as the essence of their discussions and their perspective on
the issue: "Poverty is everywhere. It has many different faces in many
different places. If I am poor, you are poor. If you are poor, we are
poor. The root of change lies in all our communities. We need to
educate, empower and inspire people around the world to join the fight
against the cause of poverty

### 2NC \-- Democracy

#### Capitalism undermines democracy through redundancy and inefficiency -- empirics 

**Cong '18** \[Wanshu; September 30; Faculty of Law at European
University Institute - Department of Law (LAW), Global Academic Fellow
at The University of Hong Kong; "Privacy and Data Protection: Solving or
Reproducing the Democratic Crisis of the Neoliberal Capitalism?" p.
13-14\] SPark

But **[[the sort of democracy driven by financial capitalism cannot be
more socially and politically-detached]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Under
financial capitalism, **[[corporations]{.mark} [compete no
longer]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the basis of their]{.underline}**
manufacturing **[[capacities but]{.mark} their [stock
values]{.mark}]{.underline}**, "immediately through gimmicks and
trickery, but more basically **[through [firing workers, moving
production, and raiding pension funds]{.mark}]{.underline}**". 26
Connected to the expansion of the global value chains, **[[manufacturing
is outsourced]{.mark} to overseas and [organized at a global level that
further separates the labour supply and
consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Financialized **[[companies]{.mark}
[thrive fast and collapse even faster]{.mark}, [unable to provide
long-term employment]{.mark} [and other benefits]{.mark} to the
employees while benefiting the corporate managers who cannot consume
their incomes and must reinvest the money.]{.underline}** The pathology
of the neoliberal, financial capitalism is a much-discussed subject.
Suffice it to say here that the interdependent and reciprocal
relationship between **[capitalist economy and people that gave
favourable [conditions for democracy is significantly
undermined]{.mark}]{.underline}** and reaches to a breaking point. The
break of the positive and reciprocal interdependence further deprives
people of the means of production and alienates people from the
commodities that bear capital value, as the generation and accumulation
of financial capital is largely independent from the work and
consumption of the wage-labour. Without the need to rely on the masses,
**[financial capitalism successfully removes its social-embeddedness and
detaches itself from democratic regulatory frameworks]{.underline}**.27
The change of the means and relationship of production has also
profoundly weakened the bargaining power of the masses. 28 Furthermore,
it is also increasingly difficult to form meaningful labour movements
that push forward institutional changes for common good and public
interest, as people in the neoliberal and consumerist age are left to
take care of themselves, in the name of so-called self-development or
self-entrepreneurship. 29

**[One consequence of the [undermining]{.mark} of the [reciprocal
interdependence is the deepening of socioeconomic
inequalities]{.mark}]{.underline}** which neoliberal governments retreat
from dealing with. **[Socioeconomic inequalities cause serious problem
to democracy, as they lead to [unequal political participation]{.mark}
and [more selective political representation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 30
That socioeconomic inequalities lead to political inequalities can be
vividly testified by the turnout rates and demographics of the elections
in the western countries of recent years.31 **[They also [form the large
social background]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the recent scandals about [cyber
security breaches]{.mark}, [data breaches]{.mark} and fake news in
elections. It can therefore be argued that [the current democratic
crisis is deeply rooted in]{.mark} the economic structure and
relationship of production of the [neoliberal financial
capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Capitalism makes true democracy impossible

**Toney, 13**, Simon Toney, University of Sydney, Department of
Government and International Relations, [Anti-Capitalism: A Beginner's
Guide]{.underline}, (PDF
version:file:///C:/Users/foxct/Dropbox/PC%20(3)/Downloads/Anti-CapitalismBG_FullText.pdf),
Zapatismo and 'post ideology', pg. 133, - FT

As a post-ideological politics Zapatismo effectively renounces the
superstructure of expectations that have informed political philosophy
since Plato invented the Philosopher Kings. This is to say that it has
forsaken the idea that knowledge or understanding can give a superior
insight into issues concerning how we should live and, thus, that, for
example, I as a political theorist with twenty or so years' worth of
heavy reading behind me, have the right or the role to 'legislate' on
behalf of others. It means that what the intellectuals or the
'vanguards' say is simply one set of views to be considered (or not)
alongside everyone else's views -- no matter how ridiculous,
incomprehensible, outlandish or outrageous the latter may seem.
**[[Everyone's]{.mark} [voice has]{.mark} in this sense equal weight and
[an equal right to be heard]{.mark}. If this sounds quite a lot like a
certain kind of democratic liberalism, then in a sense it is.
[But]{.mark} Marcos insistently poses the questions:]{.underline}**
**[[which liberal]{.underline}]{.mark}** is it that actually **[[wants
the unmediated voice to be decisive]{.underline}]{.mark}**? Which
liberal thinks that voices are more important than structures,
institutions and constitutions? **[[Which]{.mark} liberal is it that
[wants the 'voice' to be heard]{.mark} on every matter facing the
community,]{.underline}** whether it be the kind of crops to be sown or
the direction of military strategy? **[[Which liberal is]{.mark} really
[prepared to hear everyone's voice]{.mark}, [without the 'convenience'
of representatives]{.mark}]{.underline}** to give sense or 'wisdom' to
them? **[[Certainly not]{.mark} the [neoliberals]{.mark}. The problem is
that [liberalism in practice is quite]{.mark} a [different]{.mark}
proposition [to]{.mark} democratic [liberalism in theory,]{.mark} which

### 2NC \-- Genocide 

#### Causes structural genocide

Leech 13, Leech, Capitalism as a structural genocide and the socialist
alternative, Garry, BA in political science from University of Nevada --
Las Vegas and MA in Sociology at Arcadia University, pages 1-7, IShone

I intend to argue in this thesis that **[[capitalism is inherently
genocidal]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But in order to argue that capitalism
is inherently genocidal, **[[it]{.underline}]{.mark}** must **[[first
be]{.underline}]{.mark}** shown **[[that violence is inherent
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[capitalist
system]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There are many examples throughout
history of direct physical violence on a massive scale being utilized on
behalf of capital---**[[the annihilation of
aboriginals]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Americas, **[[the slave
trade]{.mark}, [World War One,]{.mark}]{.underline}** etc.---but these
can easily be dismissed as exceptions to the norm given the relatively
sporadic nature of their occurrence. Therefore, to effectively argue
that capitalism is inherently genocidal it is crucial to show that
violence is: 1) inherent in the internal logic of capital; 2) that it is
a permanent feature of the capitalist system and, therefore, is
‗intentional'; and 3) that the form that the violence takes is
structural. Furthermore, I [will argue that structural violence is not
only inherent in the capitalist system, but that it results in mass
death on a genocidal scale, thereby constituting structural genocide.
Over the past thirty years, I have travelled and worked extensively in
Latin America. During this time I could not help but notice that
significant portions of the population of Latin America endure degrees
of poverty inconceivable to most people in the United States and
Canada]{.underline}. Furthermore, in many places, the degree of
**[[poverty has not diminished over these
decades]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [a**[nd inequality has actually
increased.]{.underline}**]{.mark} These observations from my time in
Latin America led me to question why such disparities exist between the
population in North America who are relatively wealthy and the large
majority of people 2 in Latin America who continue to endure such
hardship. After all, this disparity exists in a hemisphere---indeed, in
a world---that contains more than a sufficient supply of resources to
ensure that everyone's basic needs are met (Kapitza 2009:9). The
conclusion I reached was that the structures prevalent under
capitalism**[, [while providing impressive
opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[for wealth
generation]{.underline}**]{.mark}, also ensure that the wealth
**[[generated remains in]{.underline}]{.mark}** the hands of [**[a small
minority]{.mark}**. I also came to realize that these structures
contributed to the deaths of millions of people annually. But do these
deaths constitute a form of genocide]{.underline}? [In order to make my
case that these deaths do indeed constitute structural genocide under
the logic of capital, I will first examine the concept of structural
violence]{.underline}. According to Johan Galtung (1969:175), **[[social
injustice and inequality]{.mark},]{.underline}** both in power and
wealth**[, [lie at the]{.mark}]{.underline}** core of [**[structural
violence]{.underline}** **[when]{.underline}**]{.mark} they result from
social **[[structures]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[disproportionately
benefit one group of people]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[while preventing
others from meeting their fundamental needs]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[Therefore, social structures that cause human suffering and even death
constitute structural violence]{.underline}. David Roberts (2008:19)
expands on this concept by arguing that the **[[inequality caused by
social structures does not have to be
intentional]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Even if this inequality that impedes
peoples ability to meet their fundamental needs results ―indirectly and
largely unintentionally‖ from social structures **[it [still constitutes
structural violence]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[This framework is
key]{.underline}**]{.mark} because **[[it allows
us]{.underline}]{.mark}** analytically **[to [separate violence and
oppression from intentionality]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and also allows
us to see that social systems---managed by conscious individuals who
make daily choices---can develop a pseudo-autonomy which makes it 3
appear that there is nowhere to go to demand accountability and, indeed,
that no one is responsible. However, having stated this, I will also
argue that **[[structural violence]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[is
an]{.underline}]{.mark}** inevitably [**[outcome of
actions]{.underline}** **[that adhere to]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
internal **[[logic of a social system]{.mark}]{.underline}** could be
considered as an intentional outcome of those actions. I will then
define structural genocide. In [order to achieve this I will draw on the
United Nations' Genocide Convention (United Nations 1951) and the Rome
Statute of the International Criminal Court (United Nations 1999) to
demonstrate why the structural violence inherent in capitalism
constitutes structural genocide.]{.underline} I will refer to the work
of Beth van Schaack (1997) and Ervin Staub (2002) in order to argue for
an expansion of the definition of genocide to include political groups
and other collectivities. Ultimately, it is not necessary to argue that
the capitalist system---or those managing the system---be held
accountable in a court of law.1 Rather, **[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
various [**[definitions of genocide]{.underline}**
**[highlight]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[the illegitimacy of a capitalist
system]{.underline}]{.mark}** in **[[which structural
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}** constitutes an inherent component. The
point is not to engage in polemics, but to argue that there are solid
analytical and political reasons to use the term genocide due to the
ongoing systematic--- even routine---nature of the structural violence
under capitalism and its sheer scale. While Galtung's concept of
structural violence is crucial to the ideas examined below, it does not
exist in a vacuum. **[[If we are]{.underline}]{.mark}** to **[[examine
structural violence]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a particular social
system, in this case **[[the capitalist system]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
then **[[we must understand]{.underline}]{.mark}** some of the **[[key
features of this system]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the power
**[[relations that ensure its continuity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For
this purpose, the central argument is grounded in a critique of
capitalism that draws on Karl Marx (1959; 1992; 1993; 1998) and on
contemporary Marxist scholars such as Michael Lebowitz (2003; 2010),
István Mészáros (2010), David Harvey (2005), Samir Amin (2011), Slavoj
Žižek (2008; 2009) and Joel Kovel (2007). There are some broad themes
that underpin the work of all of these scholars that will be useful to
my analysis. They include, but are not limited to, a critique of the
market economy and liberal democracy, or the ―alienated democracy,‖ as
Amin (2011:180) calls it; the commodification of labour power and land,
and by extension the person and nature; the inherently expansive and
exploitative nature of capital in its drive for profit; the
dispossession of increasing numbers of people from their land and
livelihoods; and the ecological crisis that is inherent in capitalism. I
will also draw on the work of Indian physicist and philosopher Vandana
Shiva (2005b:45), who analyzes contemporary ‗enclosures' in the global
South as a component of what she calls ―cowboy capitalism.‖ As history
makes clear, there are analytical and ideological justifications for the
capitalist system. Therefore, it is important to ground the critique of
capitalism in a clear understanding of the perspectives that have
dominated---and continue to dominate---the justifications for the
contemporary social order. For this, I draw on authors such as Milton
Friedman (2002), Friedrich Hayek (1962) and Ludwig von Mises (1996;
2006). Some broad thematic concerns will be explored such as why liberal
democracy is the ideal, and only, form of democracy compatible with
capitalism, and that capitalism can also function well in
anti-democratic settings. And why, ultimately, the rights of the
‗citizen' are directly linked to a person's status as a ‗consumer' in a
social system. governed by the logic of capital. These justifications
are important because they continue to inform contemporary policy-making
under neoliberal globalization, not only at the national level, but also
within international institutions such as the World Trade Organization
(WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Four
case studies will be presented in order to illustrate how the structural
violence inherent in capitalism impacts millions, even billions, of
people at the beginning of the 21st century. The first case study shows
how **[[so-called free market policies]{.underline}]{.mark}**
implemented **[[under the]{.underline}]{.mark}** North American Free
Trade Agreement ([**[NAFTA]{.underline}**)]{.mark}
**[[have]{.underline}]{.mark}** forcibly
**[[dispossessed]{.mark}]{.underline}** almost **[[two million Mexican
farmers of their lands]{.underline}]{.mark}** and livelihoods. The
failure of Mexican farmers to compete with **[[cheaper,
subsidized]{.mark}]{.underline}** agricultural [**[imports from
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates has **[[resulted in a
flood]{.mark}]{.underline}** of dispossessed peasants **[[to urban
areas]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a desperate and **[[often fruitless
search for jobs]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The **[[structural violence that
dispossessed farmers]{.underline}]{.mark}** and others of their
livelihoods has **[[resulted in many becoming victims
of]{.mark}]{.underline}** the direct **[[physical
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}** that has **[[flourished
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** the midst **[[of social
breakdown]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [**[that has]{.underline}**
**[killed tens of thousands of people]{.underline}**]{.mark} in recent
years. This **[[violence]{.mark}]{.underline}** has most visibly
[**[manifested itself]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
forms of **[[turf wars between]{.underline}]{.mark}** competing [**[drug
cartels]{.underline}** **[and femicide]{.underline}**]{.mark} in cities
situated along the border with the United States. Many more dispossessed
farmers and other impoverished Mexicans have become economic refugees,
with thousands dying in their desperate attempts to illegally cross the
border into the United States in search of a viable means of
subsistence. The **[[second case study examines farmer
suicides]{.underline}]{.mark}** in India. Under neoliberal
globalization, **[[millions of farmers in India began borrowing
money]{.underline}]{.mark}** in order **[[to
purchase]{.underline}]{.mark}** genetically-modified
([**[GM]{.underline}**) **[and hybrid seeds patented
under]{.underline}**]{.mark} the **[[WTO]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s
intellectual property rights regime. [**[These seeds were]{.underline}**
**[supposed to increase]{.underline}**]{.mark} their
**[[yields]{.underline}]{.mark}** and, by extension, [**[their
incomes]{.underline}**, **[but when the promised]{.underline}**]{.mark}
increases in yields **[[failed to materialize]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
Indian **[[farmers were unable to pay]{.underline}]{.mark}** off
**[[their debts]{.underline}]{.mark}** and[, **[in many
cases]{.underline}**, **[had to borrow more money]{.underline}** **[to
purchase new seeds in a desperate struggle to
survive]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [The inability of Mexican farmers to
compete with cheap imports from the United States eventually made them
increasingly vulnerable to direct physical violence at the hands of
others; the same structural violence has resulted in many Indian farmers
also dying from direct physical violence---]{.underline}but often at
their own hands. **[[Since]{.underline}]{.mark}**
19**[[97]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[more than 200,000 Indian farmers
have committed suicide; having seen no other]{.underline}]{.mark}**
honourable **[[means of escaping]{.underline}]{.mark}** the spiralling
**[[debts that resulted from global capitalist
structures]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Sainath 2010) The third case study
illustrates how **[[structural violence not only makes
people]{.underline}]{.mark}** increasingly **[[vulnerable
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** direct **[[physical
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**---either at the hands of others or at
their own hands---[**[it also directly kills people]{.underline}**.
**[More than ten million people]{.underline}**]{.mark} globally [**[die
every year from hunger]{.underline}** **[and from preventable and
treatable diseases]{.underline}**]{.mark} such as malaria, diarrhoea,
tuberculosis and AIDS, with Sub-Saharan Africa the region most seriously
impacted (United Nations 2008). This **[[structural violence is a direct
consequence of policies]{.underline}]{.mark}** that adhere to the logic
of capital, which ensures food security for the global North and
significant profits for agri-businesses and pharmaceutical companies,
but fails 7 to see value in human beings whose labour power is not
required and who are too poor to be consumers. The fourth and final case
study examines how **[ca[pitalism is unsustainable from an ecological
perspective]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and argues that **[[this constitutes
a form of structural violence against future
generations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The logic of **[[capital requires
constant growth]{.underline}]{.mark}** in order to accumulate wealth,
but **[[that growth is dependent on the destruction of
nature]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Inevitably, the drive to maximize profits
that lies at the root of the logic of capital requires that essential
natural resources be exploited in an unsustainable manner---to
disproportionately benefit a wealthy minority at the expense of the
basic needs of the majority. This process not only constitutes
structural violence perpetrated by the haves against the have-nots
today, it also represents structural violence against future generations
who will not be able to meet their basic needs.

### 2NC \-- Colonialism

#### Capitalism caused colonialism

**Toney, 13**, Simon Toney, University of Sydney, Department of
Government and International Relations, [Anti-Capitalism: A Beginner's
Guide]{.underline}, (PDF
version:file:///C:/Users/foxct/Dropbox/PC%20(3)/Downloads/Anti-CapitalismBG_FullText.pdf),
the hows and whys of the thing called capitalism, pg. 13, - FT

To answer this question we need to make a link between wage labour and
profit creation, for what has yet to be clarified is why anyone would
want to work for someone else rather than work for themselves as, say, a
subsistence farmer. **[[Why do most]{.mark} of us [work for someone
else]{.mark}, and not for ourselves, or for our families, or relatives
or friends and neighbours, or with whom we choose? Historically, [the
reason]{.mark} why most of us work for others [is that we have very
little choice]{.mark} but to do so.]{.underline}** It is again a truism
to note that in most parts of the world, the most important resource
allowing a degree of independence to individuals, namely **[[land, was
conquered, invaded or]{.mark} otherwise [taken from indigenous groups to
serve]{.mark} the needs of [royal families]{.mark},
[conquistadores]{.mark}, [colonial barons]{.mark}, [imperial elites or
states]{.mark}. [In the UK]{.mark} the story of the creation of
'[masterless men' -- or future 'employees']{.mark} -- is one that
[concerns conquest of a]{.mark} particularly [crude]{.mark}, and at
times bloody, [kind]{.mark} over the course of the previous three
centuries, and this is to say nothing of '1066' and the Norman conquest
of Britain]{.underline}**. It was crude in the case of the 'enclosures'
of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. This ensured that
**[[large chunks of]{.mark} the [English countryside were hived off
to]{.mark} the '[great families']{.mark}]{.underline}** in the name of
'improving' the land, that is making it available for agro-industrial
development or building plots. It was bloody in the case of the
'Highland clearances' of the same period that ensured royal and noble
control over the magnificent wilderness regions of Scotland. The effect
was the same. **[Formerly independent 'subsistence' [farmers were thrown
off the land]{.mark}, in turn [forcing them into]{.mark} the [towns and
cities]{.mark} to search for work.]{.underline}** We can note that some
of the very first 'anti-capitalist' protests and demonstrations were
sparked off by such processes, and account in part for the sporadic
resistances, sometimes violent, that punctuate modern British history,
notwithstanding the insistence in 'official' history of the idea of
Britain's 'peaceful' historical development.

#### Capitalism emboldened the racist structures of colonialism and capitalism that encoded white supremacy

**Gerrard 21,** Gerard, Education and Racial Capitalism, Jessica,
Chapter 2 - IShone

Racial **[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, then**[, [is a
means]{.mark}]{.underline}** by which **[[to
bring]{.underline}]{.mark}** together **[[the intersecting structures of
racism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, colonialism and capitalism that are
differently configured across contexts**[[.
Capital]{.underline}]{.mark}** has always **[[depended
on]{.underline}]{.mark}** the appropriation of **[[land
and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the labour of **[[enslaved,
indentured]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and dispossessed people -- which
**[[under transatlantic slavery]{.underline}]{.mark}** and British
[**[colonialism]{.underline}** **[became]{.underline}**]{.mark} bound to
the colonial [**[expression of white supremacy]{.underline}**.
**[The]{.underline}**]{.mark} racialised
**[[exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark}** of land and labour
**[[under]{.mark}]{.underline}** British settler **[[colonialism
enabled]{.underline}]{.mark}** the creation of [**[capital that encoded
'white ownership]{.underline}**']{.mark} into social, political and
legal norms (Harris
[1993](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/13613324.2021.2001449);
Bhandar
[2018](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/13613324.2021.2001449);
Moreton-Robinson
[2015](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/13613324.2021.2001449)).
[Focused attention on the interwoven histories of capitalism and
colonialism helps to see how racialisation is central to the divisions
and categorisations of capitalism, which have sought to establish the
classed, raced, and gendered social relations that enable capital
accumulation. Analyses of racial capitalism, then, recognise race as a
shifting signifier: race does not have 'inherent' or fixed meaning,
rather it is an historically situated formation which articulates with
systems and practices of domination to have profound material effects
(Omi and Winant
[2014](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/13613324.2021.2001449);
Hall
[1996](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/13613324.2021.2001449)).]{.underline}
Indeed, the long view we speak of here draws attention to the enduring
practices of racialisation, and attending divisions, as constantly
changing and diverse. Melamed
([2011](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/13613324.2021.2001449)),
for instance, identifies how post-WWII liberal multicultural, and even
self-declared anti-racist, initiatives prompted changes in the orders of
racial capitalism. Whilst significantly challenging the institutions and
cultures of racial capitalism, ultimately these initiatives became a
means for 'diversity' and 'inclusion' to become symbolic, performative
and associated with feelings of 'doing good' without altering systems of
oppression. The dynamic character of racial capitalism indicates the
centrality of systems of education as sites for both social regulation
and control and for struggle, contestation and renewal. Robinson
([2000](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/13613324.2021.2001449)),
for instance, draws on the example of 19th-century British colonial
mission schools to demonstrate how education can both emblemise the
colonial project of control and reveal its limit points. Mission schools
were spaces of domination which aimed to eradicate Blackness and
cultivate white supremacy, and yet, at the same time, colonised people's
survivance, insurgency and refusal through education showed that the
project of education was neither all-determining nor complete (Robinson
[2000](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/13613324.2021.2001449),
pp 179--181).

#### Capitalism is fed by colonialism

**Toney, 13**, Simon Toney, University of Sydney, Department of

version:file:///C:/Users/foxct/Dropbox/PC%20(3)/Downloads/Anti-CapitalismBG_FullText.pdf),
towards a global (economic) village: interdependence and the
transnationalisation of capitalism, pg. 18, - FT

It is no doubt true to say that **[[capitalism has]{.mark} since its
beginnings always [been a]{.mark} world or ['global' system]{.mark}, in
the sense that [the rise of capitalism coincides with]{.mark}, and feeds
upon, the rise of [colonialism]{.mark} [and inter-continental
conquest]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The **[[markets of Europe]{.mark} in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries [were never]{.mark} in this
sense [merely markets for]{.mark} local [produce]{.mark}, with local
buyers and local sellers, [but were supplemented with]{.mark} [produce
from colonies and overseas 'possessions']{.mark} such as tobacco, wood
and precious metals.]{.underline}** But what is equally obvious is the
degree to which, over the course of the development of the modern world,
**[we see an ever-increasing interdependence between markets, producers
and sellers. The 'shopper' in sixteenth-century Nottingham (where the
author finds himself \...) would have been choosing goods that mostly
came from the surrounding area, the odd pouch of tobacco
notwithstanding.]{.underline}** Today Nottingham's shoppers are
confronted by a vast array of goods from all over the world. **[Indeed
the part of the world least represented on the shelves of the local
shops would be Nottingham itself]{.underline}** which, like so many
other areas of post-industrial England, produces very little compared
with even thirty years ago when it was known for the production of
bicycles, lace, and cigarettes. **[[The hero of]{.mark} Alan
[Sillitoe's]{.mark} famous [novel]{.mark} (and film) Saturday Night and
Sunday Morning, [set in the Nottingham]{.mark} of the 1950s, [was an
industrial factory worker]{.mark} living amongst other factory workers.
[Now he would be]{.mark} more likely to be [a security guard or]{.mark}
telesales [operative]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But what does this
interdepend-ence actually mean? **[What does it mean to be increasingly
interdependent apart from the fact that there is more stuff to buy in
the shops?]{.underline}**

### 2NC \-- Alienation

#### A workers life in the capitalistic society is diminished by alienation and reduces humans to animalistic like actions

**Swain 19** Swain, 2019, Dan, Professor of Life Studies at the
University of Life Sciences Prague [Alienation or Why Capitalism is
Bad,]{.underline} Chapter 2, 322-343 - IShone

[**[These two aspects of alienation]{.mark}---from [products and]{.mark}
from [the process of labor]{.mark} itself**---[became]{.mark} interwoven
in an [important]{.mark} concept [for Marx's later economic
theory:]{.mark} commodity fetishism]{.underline}. In a notoriously
complex section of Capital, Marx described how the conditions of
capitalist production and exchange lead to objects taking on a life of
their own[. [Human beings relate to]{.mark} one [another]{.mark} in the
market [as bearers of commodities]{.mark}]{.underline}---labor power on
the one side and capital on the other. This means that, as I. [I. Rubin
(1973](https://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190695545.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190695545-e-12#oxfordhb-9780190695545-e-12-bibItem-24):29)
put it, "Production relations are not established only for things, but
through things," and as a result cooperative social activity appears as
a kind of relationship between commodities. [[This leads to commodities
acquiring a]{.mark} social [significance over]{.mark} and above [their
specific use]{.mark} and purpose, [appearing to have a life of their
own.]{.mark} [Marx
(1867](https://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190695545.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190695545-e-12#oxfordhb-9780190695545-e-12-bibItem-19):
165) here draws direct comparison with fetishistic worship of objects,
which involves projecting human powers onto objects that do not possess
them:]{.underline} "There the products of the human brain appear as
autonomous figures endowed with a life of their own, which enter into
relations both with each other and with the human race. So it is in the
world of commodities with the products of men's hands" ([Marx \[1867\]
1976](https://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190695545.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190695545-e-12#oxfordhb-9780190695545-e-12-bibItem-19):165).
In the age of the smartphone, it has become almost a cliché to talk
about people being ruled by their devices, seeing them not as useful
products but as organizers of our lives. For Marx, this is simply the
latest manifestation of a system where things dominate activity, not
vice versa. [Marx did not stop, however, [at observing workers'
alienation]{.mark} [from their product and from their labor
itself.]{.mark} **[He suggests that]{.mark}** **in [separating workers
from their labor]{.mark}, [capitalist production also separates them
from what makes them]{.mark} distinctively [human---their "essence" or
"species-being."]{.mark}** []{.mark}This is the source of much
controversy, some of which will be addressed in section
[2](https://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190695545.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190695545-e-12#oxfordhb-9780190695545-e-12-div1-2),
[but]{.mark} at [its core is a claim that alienated labor is inhuman
labor,]{.mark} since it denies the realization of [distinctively human
capacities (]{.mark}in later works, Marx talks about species powers,
rather than species being). [Marx identifies in humans a]{.mark}
distinct [capacity for consciously planning and reflecting on their
activity: "**Man reproduces himself not only intellectually, in his
consciousness, but actively and actually, and he can**]{.mark} therefore
[**contemplate himself in a world he**]{.mark} himself [**has
created**"]{.mark} (\[1844\]1975: 329[). Alienated labor]{.mark} denies
this capacity. Labor [is]{.mark} frequently [reduced to]{.mark} the
status of [merely reflexive]{.mark} [and repetitive activity]{.mark},
and [even when it is]{.mark} more [creative or complex]{.mark}, it
appears fundamentally as the plan of another and dominated by abstract
labor time.]{.underline} (p. 365) Marx ultimately saw this as having
devastating consequences for human well-being. The worker "does not
confirm himself in his work, but denies himself, feels miserable and not
happy, does not develop free mental and physical energy, but mortifies
his flesh and ruins his mind." ([Marx \[1867\]
1976](https://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190695545.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190695545-e-12#oxfordhb-9780190695545-e-12-bibItem-19):326).
At worst, workers are reduced to mere appendages of a machine, with
their bodies fundamentally marked by the kind of labor they perform. As
John Berger vividly describes, "The repetition by which gesture is laid
upon gesture, precisely but inexorably, the pile of gestures being
stacked minute by minute, hour by hour is exhausting. The rate of work
allows no time to prepare for the gesture, to demand effort from the

observed how this kind of specialization also has broader social
consequences: this division of labor seizes upon not only the economic,
but every other sphere of society, and everywhere lays the foundation
for that specialization, that development in a man of one single faculty
at the expense of all others, which already caused Adam Ferguson, the
master of Adam Smith, to exclaim: 'We make a nation of Helots, and have
no free citizens.' [Thus, in narrowing down human activity to a
particular form of abstractly and largely unconsciously expended labor[,
capitalism stunts human development,]{.mark} leading to "[incomplete"
human beings dominated by "animal" functions rather than human
ones.]{.mark}]{.underline} Marx's reference to the division of labor
"seizing upon" every other sphere of society also indicates the
importance of the broader social consequences of alienation---alienation
from others. Those who engage in wage labor are alienated both from
those they work for, and those they work with. As already discussed, the
will of the capitalist appears as the dominating will of another, while
other workers appear as much as potential competitors as cooperators.
Workers are only capable of engaging in collective activity through the
sale of their labor power, and so while in the workplace they appear as
separate elements brought together only by the capitalist, outside they
must compete with one another to get the best price for their labor.
Moreover, to the extent this appears (through commodity fetishism) as
first of all a relationship between things, it takes on a kind of false
objectivity, in which such relationships appear "natural," rather than
historically specific. Relations of production and exchange take on the
appearance of a natural force, like the weather, which can be understood
and even manipulated but not ultimately transformed. In this sense,
alienation is self-reinforcing, since it both gives rise to and depends
on representing human activity as an external, dominating force.

#### Alienation is directed connected to capitalism, even if both the capitalist and the worker both experience it the worker is on the higher end

**Swain 19** Swain, 2019, Dan, Professor of Life Studies at the
University of Life Sciences Prague [Alienation or Why Capitalism is
Bad,]{.underline} Chapter 4 - IShone

[[Marx did not see alienation, as]{.mark} some [others]{.mark} have: as
an inevitable product of modern technology or mass society**. [Rather,
he saw it as connected to a particular form of economic organization:
capitalism]{.mark}**. He believed that it could be overcome, or at least
minimized]{.underline}, in an alternative society. Moreover, he believed
that [alienated workers had an interest in confronting and challenging
their alienation]{.underline} and that through this process such an
alternative society might emerge. These points, too, provide fertile
grounds for debate. We have already discussed the importance of the
concept of alienation in the context of the Cold War and the debates
concerning the nature of the official Communist regimes but more
generally the notion of Communism as an unalienated, or at least less
alienated, society can provide a touchstone for practical political
debates. In particular, to the extent that alienation has its roots in
forms of workplace organization, it suggests that alternatives that
leave workplace hierarchies substantially intact are unlikely to be
sufficient. It cautions against an overidentification of Communism with
nationalization and state control, at the expense of sustained
consideration of questions of social domination and empowerment. [At the
same time, Marx's insistence **[that lack of control at work is
fundamentally rooted in capitalist relationships]{.mark}** of
[production and exchange]{.mark}]{.underline} provides a challenge to
accounts that believe we can empower people while leaving such relations
fundamentally intact. If a focus on alienation can tell us something
important about alternatives to capitalism, it also suggests something
about the process by which such a society comes to be. In particular,
**[[it suggests an idea of]{.underline}]{.mark}** revolution as an
activity of "**[[de-alienation]{.underline}]{.mark}**." On this
understanding, revolutionary transformation involves a process coming to
recognize oneself in the world through the process of changing it: and
in particular recognizing what appeared as alien, external forces as
human activity. Marx seems to have believed that this kind of process
took place to a certain extent "naturally" as workers are forced to
organize to defend their own interests in necessarily antagonistic
relationships with their exploiters. Here it is important to note that,
[[while Marx sees both workers and capitalists as
alienated]{.mark},]{.underline} there is an important difference:
**[[The worker stands on a higher plane than the capitalist from the
outset]{.mark},]{.underline}** since the latter has his roots in the
process of alienation and finds absolute satisfaction in it whereas
right from the start the [[worker is a victim who confronts it as a
rebel and experiences it as a process of
enslavement.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Theres only negatives to alienation, no positive alternative and it only further alienates workers - 

**Swain 19** Swain, 2019, Dan, Professor of Life Studies at the
University of Life Sciences Prague [Alienation or Why Capitalism is
Bad,]{.underline} Chapter 2, pg. 276 - IShone

However, it is worth stepping back from these various debates to ask to
what extent alienation really depends on a substantive idea of human
nature or of the fully realized human. In Marx, [**[alienation
appears]{.mark}** first and foremost not as a failure to live a certain
way but **[as a]{.mark}** kind of **[pathological relationship to one's
own activity.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [Rahel Jaeggi
(2014)](https://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190695545.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190695545-e-12#oxfordhb-9780190695545-e-12-bibItem-11)
has recently argued for a reading of alienation as a kind of "relation
of relationlessness." On this reading, what is at stake is not a failure
to realize any specific essence or core self [but **[a failure in the
relationship of a subject to their own activity]{.mark}** in which
activities appear unchosen: either as externally imposed or simply as
natural and inevitable.]{.underline} This need not depend either on
identifying a specific kind of human activity, or on the idea of a
perfect recognition of all activity as one's own---but merely the idea
there is some activity that we could see as our own that we do not.
While Jaeggi does not read Marx himself in these terms, it is possible
to do so. Even in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, species
being is represented not as some specific core of human activities but
free, self-directed activity itself, strongly suggesting that the
relationship to the (p. 369) activity was far more significant than the
kind of activity. Moreover, Marx's positive account of human nature
generally appears as future oriented, often identified with the goal of
Communist society itself (see [Ollman
1971](https://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190695545.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190695545-e-12#oxfordhb-9780190695545-e-12-bibItem-23):111--120).
In this sense, to the extent that Marx has an idea of essence or nature
it can be seen as anticipatory, committed to the possibility that a
richer relationship to our activity is possible without committing him
to a particular (substantive or overdemanding) model of what this
involved[. Here, **[alienation appears primarily as a negative
concept]{.mark}**, as a failure; but **[it does not]{.mark}** therefore
**[bring with it a]{.mark}** specific **[positive alternative]{.mark}**.
Alienation **[thus describes an inhuman condition]{.mark}** but does not
commit us to a narrow vision of the human condition. However, [it does
commit us to]{.mark} some [claims about the human animal]{.mark}, namely
that there exist certain pathological ways of relating to our own
activity, that we are capable of recognizing them as such, and that
these are connected to specific forms of organization of social
life.]{.underline} These claims are controversial, but they are capable
of scrutiny and analysis independent of the broader philosophical
debates about essences and natures. Perhaps, then, it makes more sense
to scrutinize these claims not purely as abstract philosophical ones but
as empirical ones aimed at drawing links between specific social and
psychological phenomena and capitalist relations of production. If these
claims can be shown to contribute to an understanding of contemporary
society and its condition, then it at least partially vindicates them.

Richard Horton correctly states that, in efforts to construct a fairer
world, "we need to undertake a more realistic and rigorous analysis of
where power lies". However, Horton's Comment does not exhibit the
required rigorous analysis. Citing the dubious work of Cheikh Anta Diop
and Martin Bernal as authoritative commentary is precisely the type of
shallow gesture that he correctly criticises as inadequate. Contrary to
what Horton and Kehinde Andrews describe, **[[the]{.mark} primary
[logic]{.mark} [underpinning the western]{.mark} world [order is]{.mark}
not "that Black and Brown life is worth less".¹ The primary logic of the
world order is [that profit is valued more than human
needs]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Although **[[racist
ideologies]{.underline}]{.mark}** can and did acquire considerable
autonomy, they **[[developed]{.mark} in large part [to justify]{.mark}
rampant [capitalist exploitation and imperialism]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[Racist ideologies]{.underline}** are more than ideological
superstructures, but they **[can only be understood fully in the context
of the political economy]{.underline}** of the world system. I declare
no competing interests.. Decolonising global health: a Philippine
perspective We read Richard Horton's Offline1 with interest. We agree
that "Medicine and global health continue to be entangled with colonial
attitudes, structures, and practices."1 That is, in systems of power.
Horton concludes that "Decolonisation must mean much more." We present
perspectives from the Philippines. First, scientific journals,
cooperative trial groups, and subspecialty governing bodies should make
active efforts to include voices from low-income regions, which have
**[[substantial disparities]{.mark} in medical research]{.underline}**.
Labelling studies from these nations as global health simply maintains
the western gaze.3 These voices need a seat at the table as equal
contributors in advancing global health. Second, former (or current)
colonial powers must acknowledge and act on **[[past injustices]{.mark}
and make amends]{.underline}**. It is a little-known fact that the
Philippines was a US colony (1898--1946) and that Manila was among the
most devastated cities involved in World War 2. [Ge**[nuine
decolonisation]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of health would [entail
allocating resources]{.mark}]{.underline}** to improve the health of
people who are still impacted by the yoke of colonialism. Last, entities
of power with genuine interest in decolonising global health should
support and enable voices from communities---eg, patients, healthcare
workers, and local researchers4 --- **[and recognise that the genealogy
of decolonisation includes scholars]{.underline}**, such as José Rizal
(1861--96), who have long sought to include local and indigenous voices
in global academic discourse.5 Efforts should go beyond symbolic acts of
inclusion that might only entrench the powers that be. Instead, it is
imperative to empower---or pass power to---those they seek to serve. We
declare no competing interests.

the means of production/workers without the means of subsistence,
creditors/debtors, conquerors of land made property/the dispossessed and
removed. These antinomies of accumulation require loss, disposability,
and the unequal differentiation of human value, and racism enshrines the
inequalities that capitalism requires.

#### Capitalism's framework is racist

**Gerrard 21,** Gerrard, Education and Racial Capitalism, The University
of Melbourne, Chapter 2 - IShone

In the sections that follow, **[[we put forward]{.underline}]{.mark}**
an analytic **[[framework of racial capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that [**[aims]{.underline}** **[to extend]{.underline}**]{.mark} its
treatment within sociologies of education. Focusing on education in
contexts **[[of settler colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}** connected to
British imperialism, **[[our framing draws attention to
three]{.underline}]{.mark}** interrelated **[[practices of
education]{.underline}]{.mark}**:

**[[the practice]{.underline}]{.mark}**s of
**[[enclosing]{.mark}/]{.underline}**dispossessing that **[[stem
from]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[capitalisation of Indigenous
land]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[the containment of
people]{.underline}]{.mark}** and land, and the material construction of
education systems and sites;

**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** practices of **[[dividing
labour]{.underline}]{.mark}** that draw attention to how **[[education
rests upon racialised work]{.mark}]{.underline}** in institutions and
systems -- cleaning, building, administration, teaching, caring, and so
on; and

**[[the extraction of]{.mark}]{.underline}** value through
**[[education]{.underline}]{.mark}**, whether
**[[through]{.underline}]{.mark}** material infrastructures and
commodities, [**[hierarcised people and
knowledge]{.underline}**,]{.mark} or the outputs of education, including
racial diversity itself.

These practices are both interdependent and accumulative: dividing
labour relies upon the enclosure and dispossession of land and people,
and the extraction of value occurs through divided labour. We suggest
this three-fold framing provides a useful way to examine the role of
education in the long history of capitalism and colonialism into the
present. In addition to connecting contemporary analyses with histories
of the racialising character of capitalism, these three practices offer
important new directions for educational research. As we discuss below,
an analytic focus on enclosing/dispossessing, dividing labour, and
extraction of value brings much needed attention to aspects of
educational practice that lie underneath the more common objects of
educational research (e.g. curriculum, pedagogy, educational access,
participation and outcomes, etc.). Racial capitalism orients educational
research to a wider analysis to consider: the material bases of
education on stolen land; the divisions in labour in the production of
education; and the divisions in humanity that underpin the 'value' of
education. While we gesture towards some examples below, we hope the
conceptual framing we present can support sustained examinations of
racial capitalism in future sociologies of education.

retrospect, [Yu\'s article was a breakthrough on two crucial
points.]{.underline} First, [\"Origin Theory\" fully extended the
condemnation of political injustice in the early stages of the Cultural
Revolution to the condemnation of social inequality before the Cultural
Revolution]{.underline}. Second[, \"Origin Theory\" shattered an
official myth by pointing out that before the Cultural Revolution it was
not the people of \"good" origins who were discriminated against, but
rather it was those with [\"bad\" family backgrounds who were subjected
to the most discrimination.]{.mark}]{.underline} \"[The problem of
family origins is a serious social problem of long
standing,\"]{.underline} begins the article. It then pointed that it was
the [[youth of black origins]{.underline}]{.mark}, [not those of red
origins who were subjected to discrimination before and during the
Cultural Revolution due to the wrong class policy]{.underline}: Because
of [the influence of a reactionary line which is \"left\" in form but
right in essence, they (youth of black origins) have often been unable
to enjoy equal political treatment, particularly those youths from the
so-called [\"seven black\" origins]{.mark}]{.underline}, those \"sons of
bitches\" who have already [[become objects of
dictatorship]{.underline}]{.mark}. They are seen as [[\"criminals\" by
birth.]{.underline}]{.mark} Under the influence of this line, [family
origins are used to decide nearly everything. Youths whose origins are
not good are one cut below everybody, even to the point of being
deprived of their rights to repudiate their families,]{.underline} to
defend the Party center and Chairman Mao and to join the Red Guards. At
this time, there are [[many innocent youths who are dying premature
deaths, drowning in the deep waves of the \"only origin
theory.\"]{.underline}]{.mark} \[That is, it overemphasizes family
origin\] [In the face of this kind of serious problem, anyone who cares
about the nation\'s fate cannot but confront and investigate the
issue]{.underline}. Those view points which appear dispassionate and
universally flexible are really callous and hypocritical. We must use
the methods of unmasking and criticism to protect Chairman Mao\'s
revolutionary line.451 However, [at the beginning of the Cultural
Revolution it was often argued that people of red origins were subjected
to discrimination. \"Origin Theory\" directly confronted this artificial
myth]{.underline}. It recalled: Remember the first stage of this
movement. The problem of victimization was raised by some trendy
individuals. . . [Everybody was saying that they\'d suffered at the
hands of the revisionist clique. The revisionist clique was so
reactionary that one could hardly count as a revolutionary if one had
not only not been victimized but on the contrary had received favors
from them.]{.underline} Thus even Tan Lifu said he\'d been victimized.
Economic victimization? During the period of hardship, he feasted on
Dutch condensed milk. Political victimization? With a mind as
reactionary as his, he still got into the Party. 452 The plain fact on
the matter was, \"Origin Theory\" reminded its readers, If we think back
to the period when the revisionist clique was in power, when university
student enrollment was completed each year, the former Ministry of

## Frontlines to External Impacts

### 2NC - AT: Cap Good - Innovation

#### **Innovation is simply a capitalist buzzword used to maintain the existing exploitative order.**

**Leary '19** \[John Patrick Leary; high school teacher, author of
Keywords: The New Language of Capitalism; 4-16-2019; **[[The Innovation
Cult]{.underline}]{.mark}**; Jacobin;
https://jacobin.com/2019/04/innovation-language-of-capitalism-ideology-disruption;
7-7-2022; SK\]

**[The [value of innovation]{.mark} is so widespread and so [seemingly
self-evident]{.mark} that questioning it might seem bizarre --- like
criticizing beauty, science, or penicillin, things that are, like
innovation, treated as either abstract human values or socially useful
things we can scarcely imagine doing without]{.underline}**. And
certainly, many things called innovations are, in fact, innovative in
the strict sense: original processes or products that satisfy some human
need.

A scholar can uncover archival evidence that transforms how we
understand the meaning of a historical event; an automotive engineer can
develop new industrial processes to make a car lighter; **[a [corporate
executive can extract additional value from his employees by automating
production]{.mark}. These are all new ways of doing something, but they
are very different somethings.]{.underline} Some require a combination
of dogged persistence and interpretive imagination; [others [make use
of]{.mark} mathematical and technical expertise; others, organizational
vision and [practical ruthlessness]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

But **[innovation as it is used most often today comes with an implied
sense of benevolence; we [rarely talk of innovative credit-default swaps
or innovative chemical weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but innovations
they plainly are. The destructive skepticism of the false-prophet
innovator has been redeemed as the profit-making insight of the
technological visionary.

Innovation is most popular today as a stand-alone concept, a kind of
managerial spirit that permeates nearly every institutional setting,
from nonprofits and newspapers to schools and children's toys. The
Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines innovation as "the alteration of
what is established by the introduction of new elements or forms." The
earliest example the dictionary gives dates from the mid-sixteenth
century; the adjectival "innovative," meanwhile, was virtually unknown
before the 1960s, but has exploded in popularity since.

The verb "to innovate" has also seen a resurgence in recent years. The
verb's intransitive meaning is "to bring in or introduce novelties; to
make changes in something established; to introduce innovations." Its
earlier transitive meaning, "To change (a thing) into something new; to
alter; to renew" is considered obsolete by the OED, but this meaning has
seen something of a revival. This was the active meaning associated with
conspirators and heretics, who were innovating the word of God or
innovating government, in the sense of undermining or overthrowing each.

**[The major conflict in innovation's history is that between its
formerly prohibited, religious connotation and the salutary, practical
meaning that predominates now. Benoît Godin has shown that innovation
was recuperated as a secular concept in the late nineteenth century and
into the twentieth, when it became a form of worldly praxis rather than
theological reflection.]{.underline}** Its grammar evolved along with
this meaning. Instead of a discrete irruption in an established order,
innovation as a mass noun became a visionary faculty that individuals
could nurture and develop in practical ways in the world; it was also
the process of applying this faculty (e.g., "Lenovo's pursuit of
innovation").

Innovation as a count noun --- that is, an innovation --- was in turn
the product of this process (e.g., "the new iPhone features innovations
like a high-resolution camera"). But this new meaning evolved slowly.
**[The concept's old link to deceit and conspiracy shadowed its meaning
into the twentieth century]{.underline}**.

Joseph Schumpeter, who elaborated an influential theory of innovation
three years before the debut of the Innovation tango in his 1911 book
The Theory of Economic Development, treated it as both a process and a
product, with no sense of the old conspiratorial connotation. Schumpeter
used "innovation" to describe capitalism's tendency toward tumult and
transformation. Critical to his definition is the distinction Schumpeter
makes between innovation as the refinement of a process or product, and
invention, the creation of something entirely new.

While Schumpeter was suspicious of the mythology of the inventor, the
innovator, a more complex figure, was fundamental to the process he was
describing. He understood innovation historically, as a process of
economic transformation, but for him this historical process relied upon
a creative, private agent to carry it out. Schumpeter's term for this
agent was "the entrepreneur." To innovate, Schumpeter wrote later, was
to "revolutionise the pattern of production by exploiting an invention
or, more generally, an untried technological possibility for producing a
new commodity."

In the second decade of the twentieth century, the word began to appear
regularly in brand names and advertisements (and short-lived dance
crazes) in its now familiar form: as a new, improved product or process.
One of the first major products to be advertised as an innovation was
the Innovation wardrobe trunk, which Gimbel's department store offered
in 1915 to appeal to customers' desires for the chimera of the new. (The
trunks, the innovative features of which seem to have been their
durability and "roomy construction," were so popular that an "innovation
trunk" became a generic name for any trunk, like "Kleenex" is for
tissues.)

Although innovation has been thoroughly rehabilitated and purged of
subversion, it retains its old accent of individual prophetic vision,
the talent of those who, as Hobbes said of "innovators" in 1651,
"suppose themselves wiser than others." It is not that innovation has
lost its old moral connotation; instead, it has reversed. What we once
regarded as deviant and deceitful is now praised as visionary.

In a 2011 reflection on the late Apple computer executive Steve Jobs,
probably the archetypal hero-innovator of our time, a San Francisco
Chronicle author praised his "constant desire to innovate and take
chances." Here, the verb is used intransitively, in the more modern
sense --- that is, there is no direct object --- but it lacks even the
faintest hint of a reference. Jobs is no longer innovating on or upon
anything in particular, which can make "innovate" sound like a kind of
mantra. "If you don't innovate every day and have a great understanding
of your customers," a Denver processed cheese executive told the Denver
Post in 2010, "then you don't grow." And when the author of a Wall
Street Journal obituary for Jobs writes that the Apple executive was a
"secular prophet" who made innovation "a perfectly secular form of
hope," it is apparent that the term has never really lost its old
association with prophecy.

Other than mystifying creativity itself --- which now looks more like an
intuitive blast of inspiration, like an epiphany, and less like work ---
**[["innovation" gives creativity]{.mark} a specific professional,
[class dimension]{.mark}. It is almost always applied to white-collar
and profit-seeking activities, although its increasing popularity in
educational contexts only reflects the creeping influence of
market-based models in this field]{.underline}**. Quality organizations
are supposed to cultivate it in their employees by giving them the
freedom to work independently and creatively. **[[Rarely]{.mark} do we
[hear of the innovative carpenter]{.mark}, plumber, [or homemaker, in
spite of the imagination]{.mark}, improvisation, [and]{.mark} managerial
[skills required]{.mark} of each.]{.underline}**

Business publications issue rankings of the "most innovative countries
in the world," a curious usage that describes a) a capacity constrained
by national borders, as if creativity dissipates or increases when one
leaves passport control; and at the same time b) an intrinsic human
talent unconstrained by fields, industries, or media.

Another example of the term's increasing mystification is the
acceptability of the tautological construction "to innovate innovation."
"Who's the Best at Innovating Innovation?" asks the Harvard Business
Review; the same publication sponsors a lucrative prize called the
"Innovating Innovation Challenge." One can "innovate" without having to
act upon any process or idea other than the act of innovation itself.
One simply innovates in circles, forever.

**[Innovation is an example of the ways in which the production and
circulation of commodities becomes imbued with fantastic and even
theological properties detached from the labor that produces them, or in
the case of many common uses of the verb "to innovate," detached from
any object]{.underline}**. So when liberal politicians promote an
"innovation agenda" that includes student debt forgiveness for "startup
founders," as Hillary Clinton did during her 2016 presidential campaign,
it is unclear how this differs from any other form of corporate welfare.
**[And when conservative [politicians or CEOs lament how]{.mark} labor
unions or public [regulation of the private sector "impede
innovation]{.mark}," we can recognize this as both a [ludicrous
obfuscation]{.mark} but also another [example of the bourgeois contempt
for labor]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Innovation is thus a theological concept which became a theory of
commodity production and which has lately become a commodity itself. The
innovator, meanwhile, has always been identified with novelty and
visionary charisma. But where the innovator's visions were once widely
feared as venal and destructive, now innovation is understood as the
refinement of a technical process, in which creativity is turned to
profit.

But as the mythic figure of Jobs makes clear, rather than replacing
prophecy with procedure, modern celebrations of innovation supplement
each with the other. From the business world to education and politics,
innovation is simultaneously spiritual and technological, both an
individual's reaction against bureaucratic malaise and the spirit of
anti-orthodox creativity to be cultivated by the same bureaucracy.
**[Innovation, therefore, is a strangely contradictory concept,
simultaneously grandiose and modest, saccharine and
pessimistic.]{.underline}**

The prophetic meaning embedded deep in its history allows innovation to
stand in for nearly any kind of positive transformation, doing for the
twenty-first century what "progress" once did for the nineteenth and
twentieth. In the United States, innovation also suggests a high-tech
update to the myth of "Yankee ingenuity" or "know-how" --- the spirit of
mechanical cleverness and entrepreneurial energy once associated with
New England's artisan class. Like the mythical inventors of the American
industrial age --- Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison tinkering in
their workshops --- the innovator is a model capitalist citizen for our
times.

**[But the [object of]{.mark} most [innovations]{.mark} today is more
[elusive]{.mark}: you can touch a telephone or a phonograph, but who can
lay hands on an Amazon algorithm, a credit-default swap, a piece of
proprietary Uber code, or an international free trade
agreement?]{.underline}** As an intangible, individualistic, yet
strictly white-collar trait, **[innovation [reframes the cruel fortunes
of an unequal global economy as the logical products of]{.mark} a
creative, visionary [brilliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In this new
guise, the innovator retains both a touch of the prophet and a hint of
the confidence man.

#### Capitalism undermines the goal for which technology and science is used

**Pillay '18** \[Devan; 2018; Former trade unionist, Associate Professor
and Former Head in Sociology, University of Witwatersrand, South Africa,
Co-editor of Labour and the Challenges of Globalization; Climate Crisis,
The: South African and Global Democratic Eco-Socialist Alternatives,

'HAPPINESS'," Ch. 7, p. 152\] SPark

In other words, **[[science, technology and democratic freedoms can be
decoupled from free-market capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- indeed,
**[the self-regulated market undermines their essence]{.underline}**.
**[When scientific investigations are primarily geared towards [market
outcomes]{.mark}]{.underline}** (i.e. the profit motive), **[it
[obscures their intrinsic value and compromises social
priorities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As the state withdraws from public
education, industry is increasingly engaged in funding university
research, thus undermining its independence. **[A good example is [the
pharmaceutical industry]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which
**[[invests]{.mark} heavily [in cures for diseases of the
rich]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as Viagra or weight loss, **[[and much
less for diseases of the poor]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as
tuberculosis. There have been massive strides in private fossil
fuel-based motor vehicle innovation, but much less in cost-effective
public transport based on renewable energy. Investment in socially owned
renewal energy innovation has not matched investments in fossil fuel
energy systems, or nuclear power (although strides have been made by
China and some north European countries in recent years). **[[Democratic
participation is undermined by the power of
money]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including the ownership and control of
mass media, which ensures that the power elites control the political
sphere.10

#### Capitalism [destroys]{.underline} innovation -- [abuses]{.underline} the hard work of workers. Progress cannot be made until the abandoning of capitalism

Celine **Qin 21** \[Teen Convo Project, 7-5-2021, \"Capitalism Does Not
Breed Innovation. It Destroys It.,\" Medium,
https://theteenconvoproject.medium.com/capitalism-does-not-breed-innovation-it-destroys-it-12211c2dd573,
smarx, HHW\]

[This is a [common argument]{.mark}. "[Capitalism breeds
innovation]{.mark}!" "There have been so many technological advancements
under capitalism!"]{.underline} This idea better suits the era of late
to post-feudalism, where the emergence of capitalism allowed the growth
of newer ideas and industrial advancements, though the situation is
different for life in late capitalism.

[While it is true that the capitalist system has curated the technology
or devices we know today]{.underline} such as iPhone or various social
medias, it would [[unveil]{.mark} a [deeper]{.mark} and more complex
[analysis]{.mark} of this sort of innovation [if]{.mark} we
[considered]{.mark} the component of human [labor]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The [products]{.mark} we are familiar with were not [created]{.mark} by
businessmen and capitalists, but [by **overworked and underpaid laboring
bodies**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Furthermore, if we look at the most common examples of commodities of
global food, technology, social network, fashion, cosmetic, familyware,
and other corporations, we begin to realize that [[innovation under
capitalism]{.mark} was never the innovation created by the freedom of
creativity or originality, but [rather]{.mark} the "[innovation" of
repetition]{.mark}, of marketing and [mass producing]{.mark} whatever is
in [demand]{.mark}]{.underline}, galloping after an [endless [cycle of
finding new]{.mark}er and bigger [ways to stockpile profit]{.mark}, at
the **[expense of devouring]{.mark} the [planet and stealing from the
working class]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

"[[Capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} means production, getting rich, and
prosperity!" is a fashionable argument. It masquerades through the
assumption that the rate in which the wealth multiplies and accumulates
in the hands of so few is equivalent to the conditions of the common
people, as if to say, "The economy is doing splendid! Look how much
money these ten or so [white men that I adore for no reason have in
their hands and how charismatically they [exploit, extort]{.mark},
appropriate [from workers and]{.mark} the poor, the Global South,
cultures, colonial subjects, and the [environment]{.mark}!]{.underline}
They are helping society so much! This is exactly the very essential
image of success and we should all fight each other to reach this
destination we all so definitely and certainly will achieve!"

[In reality, [the]{.mark} massive [accumulation of wealth]{.mark} by the
upper ruling oligarchs [depends on]{.mark} impoverishing [the]{.mark}
many [exploited]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the same light, "[[innovation"
under capitalism is]{.mark} not some grand motivation stimulated by
friendly competition, but rather **[greed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [What
is authentically creative and original is excluded from the free market
formula.]{.underline}

[[**Life loses its flavor**. Humans,]{.underline}]{.mark} who naturally
breed creativity and are proven to prosper working together with the
motivation of bettering society (instead of in oppressive class society
controlled by the wealthy elite, go figure!), become controlled under
the capitalist system. [We [exploit ourselves]{.mark} [through]{.mark}
mundane routines and [oppressive work]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
people's desire [to accomplish the capitalist]{.mark} [image of
success]{.mark}]{.underline} (climbing the corporate ladder, owning
staggering amounts of capital, and achieving as much of a bourgeois
lifestyle as possible while stepping on the backs of the poor)
[[destroys]{.mark} our interpretation of the words "[freedom" and
"innovation]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[The debate around [innovation sparks]{.mark} the [question]{.mark} of
[whether]{.mark} or not [rapid innovation is]{.mark} truly
[necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}. Would it be necessary, given that the
incentive for profit, the supply and demand market, and the very need to
[compete for the sake of capital accumulation are all
abolished]{.underline}, to have the degree of "innovation" as it is
defined, 1500 brands of the same type of cereal?

[As this type of [capitalist "innovation]{.mark}" is [provoked
by]{.mark} nothing other than [profit]{.mark}, this [uncreative]{.mark}
and unoriginal transnational [trope]{.mark} would no longer need to
exist if there was no such competition]{.underline} and no longer such
as system that depends on the uneven distribution and hoarding of wealth
and the destruction of equality.

Instead, it is [[not until]{.mark} achieving an [egalitarian
society]{.mark}, one in which the human race is no longer driven to
climb the corporate ladder over the bodies of the
impoverished]{.underline}, no longer controlled by Big Capital and wage
labor, and [no longer marginalized by class hierarchy, [humans]{.mark}
can be [free to express]{.mark} [creativity and]{.mark} work towards
[help]{.mark}ing [one another]{.mark}, [cultivat]{.mark}ing a [better
world]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Universal access to resources, collective ownership, and collective
work would benefit all. What is created and enjoyed by human hands would
no longer have to serve as items that are "profitable]{.underline}" or
"unprofitable", or better put, "exploitable" or "unexploitable."

#### Capitalism isn't sustainable and tech CAN'T solve that 

Conor **Payne and** Chris **Stewart**, authors for MR online who talk
against capitalism, Irish socialist party leaders, 2-7-2022, accessed on
6-17-2022, MR Online, \"The end of growth? The capitalist economy &
ecological crisis," MR Online,
<https://mronline.org/2022/02/07/the-end-of-growth/)-> FT

**[Karl Marx said that [under cap]{.mark}italism: "Accumulation of
wealth at one pole is, therefore, at the same time accumulation of
[misery, agony]{.mark} of toil [slavery, ignorance, brutality, mental
degradation]{.mark}, at the opposite pole."]{.underline}**\[2\] This
sums up the capitalist economy today. At the same time, of course,
workers are still liable to pay the price when the system goes into
recession. **[The reality is that [at no stage in its cycle]{.mark} of
boom and bust, [does the cap]{.mark}italist [econ]{.mark}omy [operate
in]{.mark} the [interests of the working class]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Conor **[While economic [growth]{.mark} undoubtedly [drives carbon
emissions]{.mark} and all forms of environmental destruction,
contraction on a capitalist basis does not deliver an equivalent let up
in environmental intensity. According to one study, examining 150
countries over the period of 1960-2008, a [1% increase in GDP
meant]{.mark} on average a [0.73% increase in carbon]{.mark}
emissions]{.underline}**, **[while [a 1% decline]{.mark} in GDP [meant
only a 0.4% decrease]{.mark} in carbon emissions.]{.underline}**\[3\]
This is because the environmentally inefficient goods and infrastructure
created during a boom generally continue in use during a downturn. Less
consumption in itself can never deliver the necessary reduction in
carbon emissions. Instead we need a fundamental change in how we
produce. This means that without a planned transition to a sustainable
means of life the tendency will be for ever increasing emissions. So
**[the [debate about growth]{.mark} and [degrowth is]{.mark} useless
unless [linked to the need to bring]{.mark} an [end to]{.mark} the chaos
of the [cap]{.mark}italist market]{.underline}**. **[The purpose of the
capitalist economy is to deliver increased profit for the bosses. The
purpose of the economy under socialism would be to fulfill human need in
a sustainable way.]{.underline}** This means taking the key sectors of
the economy out of the hands of big business and bringing them into
public ownership, under democratic control. **[This means we can
reorganize the energy industry, transport, agribusiness and production
overall on a planned basis, in the interests of both people and the
planet]{.underline}**. Socialists want a better life for the vast
majority on this earth. **[We know many, even in the richer countries,
are in poverty or barely keeping their heads above water, do not have
access to decent housing or healthcare, or have no economic security for
the future]{.underline}**. We believe this to be completely
unjustifiable in a world of incredible abundance. For this reason, we
reject attacks on working-class living standards, even those that are
introduced with an environmental veneer, e.g. water charges, or carbon
taxes. The vast majority of the world's population is responsible for
very little in terms of carbon emissions. A recent UN report shows that
globally the top 1% of earners are responsible for a yearly per capita
average of 74 tons of C02 per year. Meanwhile for the bottom 50% of
earners the figure is 0.7 tons.\[4\] In much of the world a socialist
system would need to increase production on a sustainable basis and
redistribute wealth. Even in the wealthier capitalist countries many
sectors that are not prioritized for capitalist investment would need to
be expanded under a socialist system, not reduced--healthcare, housing,
renewable energy for a start. At the same time**[, [capitalist
production involves enormous waste.]{.mark} We should not underestimate
the extent of this:]{.underline}** As we can see, the **[[mountains of
waste produced under cap]{.mark}italism are not a product mainly of the
demands of consumers, but instead [serve]{.mark} the [needs of
cap]{.mark}italist [profiteering]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The structure
of capitalist society itself also partly conditions our consumer needs.
Those who don't live near reliable public transport "need" to buy cars,
people on low incomes will "choose" to buy fast fashion etc. **[To
create [more and more]{.mark} [products that aren't needed]{.mark} or
will be sent rapidly to landfill, or to generate more and more
artificial demand is all "growth" in capitalist terms, but it isn't
human progress.]{.underline}** A democratic, planned economy could do
"more with less" as part of a planned ecological transition--retooling
useless or destructive industries, eliminating duplication,
overproduction and planned obsolescence, focusing on fulfilling needs
not generating artificial wants and transforming agriculture, transport
and energy production on a sustainable basis. In such a system whole
industries, communities and cities would be planned democratically and
on a completely different basis, putting an end to capitalist
overproduction and waste and allowing for a more rational allocation of
resources. Some argue that a simple **[[transition to renewable
energy]{.mark} will solve the ecological problems we face. This
transition is both necessary and possible, but [won't be]{.mark} done
[under cap]{.mark}italism [that]{.mark} will [extract every source of
fossil fuels]{.mark} down to the last, so long as there is profit to be
made from them.]{.underline}** But even if this were achieved, we would
still face a range of looming ecological catastrophes. The fact is that
**[[capitalism is]{.mark} already [exceeding]{.mark} a number of
[planetary boundaries]{.mark} for safeguarding a safe environment for
human civilization on earth. These include [species extinction]{.mark},
[soil degradation]{.mark} and [deforestation]{.mark}, to name only a
few.]{.underline}** Their common source is the increasing scale and
intensity of humanity's incursions into nature, which are now
undermining the basis of our own existence on the planet. **[[Nor will
tech]{.mark}nological changes alone [solve]{.mark} the problem of a
sustainable relationship with nature. Under capitalism, the opposite is
the case:]{.underline}** while **[[tech]{.mark}nological changes result
in the more efficient use of energy, this then [creates the basis for
further expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}** and so paradoxically
technological development often results in a net increase in the amount
of energy used.\[10\] While technology may alter to some degree what the
limits are, we have to accept the reality that **["[you can't have
infinite growth on a finite planet]{.mark}". Capitalism means an
increasingly destructive and frantic search for resources that can be
extracted and land which can be developed]{.underline}**, with the
benefits of this activity more and more concentrated in the hands of the
few. Socialist planning can ensure the rational development of the
quality of our lives without increasing environmental intensity. Only on
this basis can we restructure our society around need, not profit,
creating countless socially necessary jobs in pursuit of building a
sustainable system. Socialists stand for massive investment in low
carbon jobs and sustainable infrastructure, as well as the introduction
of a four-day work-week with no loss of pay. This would not only solve
the problem of permanent unemployment under capitalism by distributing
work to all those who need it, but would also free workers up to
participate in political and economic decision-making, and would achieve
a better balance between work, our social lives and leisure. This will
still pose complex questions about how products, industries and
practices can be maintained, but these are best resolved on the basis of
democratic discussion in a society founded on equality and solidarity.

#### Capitalism stifles innovation

**Smith, 20**, Tony Smith, Tony Smith is a professor of philosophy at
Iowa State University and the author of Technology and Capital in the
Age of Lean Production, 8/30/2022, "How Capitalism Stifles Innovation",

FT

**[The [tech]{.mark}nological [dynamism of cap]{.mark}italism
[has]{.mark} [always been a powerful argument in its defence]{.mark}.
But one of its secrets is that at the heart of this change we find
neither bold entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, nor established
firms.]{.underline}** Investments pushing the frontiers of scientific
knowledge are just too risky. The advances sought may not be
forthcoming. Those that do occur may not ever be commercially viable.
Any **[potentially profitable results that do arise may take
decades]{.underline}** to make any money. And when they finally do,
t**[here are no guarantees initial investors will appropriate most of
the resulting windfall.]{.underline}** There is, accordingly, a powerful
tendency for private capital to systematically underinvest in long-term
research and development. **[Despite popular perceptions that private
entrepreneurs drive technological innovation, the [leading regions of
the global economy do not lea]{.mark}ve the most important stages of
[tech]{.mark}nological change [to]{.mark} private
[investors]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These costs are socialised. In the
quarter-century after World War II, the high profits garnered by
American corporations due to their exceptional place in the world market
allowed corporate labs to engage in "[blue-skies
research](http://scienceogram.org/in-depth/blue-skies-research/)"
projects. But even then, **[[public funding accounted for]{.mark}
roughly [two-thirds of all research]{.mark} and development expenditures
in the United States]{.underline}**, creating the foundations for the
high-tech sectors of today. With the rise of competition from Japanese
and European capital in the 1970s, private-sector funding of research
and development increased. **[However, [long]{.mark}-[term projects
were]{.mark} almost entirely [abandoned]{.mark}]{.underline}** in favor
of product development and applied-research projects promising
commercial advantages in the short-to-medium term. **[Basic research
continued to be funded by the government, like the work in molecular
biology that supported the move of agribusiness companies into
biotechnology.]{.underline}** The same was true for projects of special
interest to the Pentagon --- the developments associated with the
[Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency](http://www.darpa.mil/our_work/), for instance, which paved the
way for modern global positioning systems --- and other government
agencies. **[But medium-to-long-term R&D in general was in great danger
of falling into a "valley of death"]{.underline}** between basic
research and immediate development, with neither the government nor
private capital providing significant funding for it. **[For all their
rhetoric touting the "magic of the marketplace," those in the Reagan
administration recognised market failure when they saw
it]{.underline}**. They began to offer federal and publicly funded
university laboratories various carrots and sticks to undertake
long-term R&D for US capital. **[New programs were created to provide
start-ups with resources to develop innovations prior to the "proof of
concept" required by venture capitalists]{.underline}**. Under Reagan,
the [Small Business Innovation Development
Act](https://www.sba.gov/offices/headquarters/oca/resources/6827) even
mandated that federal agencies set aside a percentage of their R&D
budget to fund research by small firms. These and other forms of
public-private partnership have granted US capital enormous competitive
advantages in the world market. It's no surprise that Apple's
tremendously successful line of products --- iPads, iPhones, and iPods
--- incorporate twelve key innovations. **[All]{.underline}** twelve
(**[[c]{.mark}entral [p]{.mark}rocessing
[u]{.mark}nit[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**, dynamic random-access memory,
hard-drive disks, liquid-crystal displays, batteries, digital single
processing, the Internet, the HTTP and HTML languages, cellular
networks, GPS system, and voice-user AI programs) **[[were developed by
publicly funded research]{.underline}]{.mark}** and development
projects. It hasn't been the dynamics of the market so much as active
state intervention that has fueled technological change.

time while expanding real wages lead instead to forced layoffs,
increasing stress for those still employed and eroding real wages.
**[Two ongoing technological developments further strengthen the power

that no less than 47 percent of employment in the United States is at
high risk of being automated within two decades. **[Anything approaching
this level of labour displacement will yield more misery, not progress,
for ordinary workers.]{.underline}** But the lower cost and higher
capacities of machines have also led to change of a better sort. As the
prices of computer hardware, software, and Internet connections have
declined, many people can now create new "knowledge products" without
working for big capitalists. **[[Multitudes across the globe]{.mark} now
freely [choose to contribute to collective
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}** projects of interest to them, outside
the relationship of capital and wage labour. The resulting products can
now be distributed as unlimited free goods to anyone who wishes to use
them, rather than being scarce commodities sold for profit. **[It is
beyond dispute that [this]{.mark} new [form of social labour]{.mark} has
[generated innovations]{.mark} superior in quality]{.underline}** and
scale to the output of capitalist firms. These innovations also tend to
be qualitatively different. [While [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nological
**[[developments]{.mark} in capitalism primarily [address]{.mark} the
wants and needs of [those with disposable income]{.mark},]{.underline}**
open-source projects can mobilise creative energies to address areas
capital systematically neglects, such as [developing
seeds](http://www.scidev.net/global/agriculture/news/open-source-seed-released-to-nurture-patent-free-food.html)
for poor farmers or medicines for those without the money to buy
existing medications. **[[The potential]{.mark} of this]{.underline}**
new form of collective social labour **[to address pressing social needs
across the globe [is]{.mark} historically
[unprecedented]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In order to flourish, however,
open-source innovation requires free access to existing knowledge goods.
Leading **[[capital firms]{.mark},]{.underline}** hoping to extend their
ability to privately profit from publicly supported research**[, [have
used]{.mark} their immense political [power to extend the intellectual
property rights regime]{.mark}]{.underline}** in scope and enforcement,
severely restricting the access open-source projects require.
[Copyright](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2013/09/property-and-theft/),
after all, was extended for twenty years at the turn of the century,
just as internet access was starting to balloon. Despite these barriers,
the success of open-source projects shows that intellectual-property
rights are not required for innovation. **[Further evidence is provided
by the fact that [most scientific and
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nological **[[workers]{.mark} engaged in
innovation [are forced to sign away intellectual
property]{.mark}]{.underline}** rights as a condition of employment.
These rights actually hamper advancement by raising the cost of engaging
in the production of new knowledge, and by diverting funds to
unproductive legal costs.

The **[[destructive effects]{.mark} examined above are not necessary
features of tech]{.underline}**nological **[change]{.underline}**;
**[they [are]{.mark} [necessary features o]{.mark}f technological change
in [capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Overcoming them requires
overcoming capitalism, even if we only have a provisional sense of what
that might mean. The pernicious tendencies associated with technological
change in capitalist workplaces are rooted in a structure where managers
are agents of the owners of the firm's assets, with a fiduciary duty to
further their private interests. But a society's means of production are
not goods for personal consumption, like a toothbrush. **[The material
reproduction of society is]{.underline}** **[an inherently
public]{.underline}** matter, as the technological development of
capitalism itself, resting on public funds, confirms. **[Capital
markets]{.underline}**, where private claims to productive resources are
bought and sold, **[treat public power as if it were just another item
for personal use.]{.underline}** They can, and should, be totally done
away with. Large-scale productive enterprises should instead be
acknowledged as a distinct type of public property, and exercises of
authority within these workplaces as acts of public authority. **[The
principle of democracy must]{.underline}** then **[come into
play:]{.underline}** all exercises of this authority must be subject to
the consent of those impacted by it. Though additional regulations would
be needed if managers were elected and subject to recall by the
workforce as a whole, **[[tech]{.mark}nological [advances]{.mark} in
productivity would not typically [result in]{.mark} the involuntary
unemployment of some and the overwork of others, but rather in [reduced
work for all]{.mark}.]{.underline}** We know this because workers say
they want more time to spend with their families and friends, or on
projects of their own choosing. With [democracy in the
workplace](http://www.solidarityeconomy.net/2006/08/29/after-capitalism-economic-democracy-an-interview-with-david-schweickart/),
**[the drive to introduce de-skilling technologies would be replaced
with a search for ways to make work more interesting]{.underline}** and
creative. Suppose that decisions regarding the general level of new
investment were also a matter for public debate, eventually decided by a
democratic body. If there were pressing social needs, the overall rate
of new investment could be increased; if this were not the case, it
could be stabilised. These bodies could then set aside a portion of new
investment funds to provide public goods free of charge, putting more
useful goods and services outside the market's reach. **[The public
goods of scientific and tech]{.underline}**nological **[knowledge
resulting from basic research]{.underline}** and long-term R&D would be
decommodified, too, as would the fruits of open-source innovation. The
latter could be unleashed by abolishing intellectual property rights and
by providing an adequate [basic
income](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2013/05/curious-utopias/) to all ---
enabling anyone who wished to participate in open-source projects to do
so. If special incentives were required, **[[generous prizes could be
awarded]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the first to solve important
challenges. **[[Remaining funds could then be
distributed]{.underline}]{.mark}** to other elected bodies at various
geographical levels, each of which would determine what share would go
to public goods in a region. The remainder would be distributed to local
community banks charged with allocating them to worker enterprises.
Various qualitative and quantitative measures could be employed to
measure the extent to which those enterprises used technologies to meet
social wants and needs effectively, with the results determining the
income beyond the basic level received by their members (and the members
of the community banks that allocated investment funds to them).
**[[Abolishing i]{.mark}ntellectual [p]{.mark}roperty [r]{.mark}ights
[would]{.mark} have the added benefit of [ensur]{.mark}ing that [wealthy
regions could not use]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nological knowledge [as a
weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}** to create and reproduce inequality in the
global economy. This danger would be all but eliminated if every region
were granted a fundamental right to its per capita share of new
investment funds. Finally, if workplaces used productivity advances to
free up time for their workers rather than to increase the output of
commodities, resources would be depleted and waste generated at a much
lower rate. **[Abolishing capital [markets]{.mark} and replacing them
with democratic control over levels of new investment [would free
humanity]{.mark} from the "grow or die" imperative and the environmental
consequences]{.underline}** that follow from it. If enterprises were
acknowledged as inherently matters of public concern, it would eliminate
the obscene absurdity of having the fate of humanity rest on whether
profit-driven oil companies have the political and cultural power to
extract and sell an estimated \$20 trillion of fossil-fuel reserves, as
they clearly plan to do. **[If open-source innovation flourished, the
[creative]{.mark} [energies of]{.mark} collective social [labour]{.mark}
across the planet [could be mobilised]{.mark}]{.underline}** to address
environmental challenges. If poor regions with fragile ecologies were
guaranteed their fair share of new investment funds, the pressure to
sacrifice long-term sustainability for the sake of short-term growth
would be overcome. **[Of course, all of these proposals are vague and
provisional.]{.underline}** Nonetheless, **[they show that the social
consequences of technological change could be far
different]{.underline}** than they are today. We do not need private
ownership of productive assets, or markets devoted to financial assets,
to have a technologically dynamic society. **[[With]{.mark} the
necessary political [shifts]{.mark},
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nological change **[[would no longer be
associated with]{.mark} [overaccumulation,]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[financial crises]{.mark}, the [stifling of]{.mark} open-source
[innovation]{.mark}, severe global [inequality, or]{.mark} the
increasingly palpable threat of [environmental
catastrophe]{.mark}.]{.underline}** We need to unleash the full
potential of human ingenuity. The way technology advances is already
socialised in important, if restricted and inadequate ways. We can
finish the job and make sure that its fruits are put to the benefit of
ordinary people.

Climate Denialism and "Green Capitalism": Two Sides of the Same Coin

Faced with the catastrophic scenario that global warming entails, the
powers of international capitalism waver between two strategies: On the
one hand, there is a campaign to deny scientific evidence as a supposed
ideology; on the other, there is a strategy to promote ["green" or
"sustainable" capitalism. [Green capitalism defends farcical
international agreements and proposes partial and limited changes to
productive systems, while strengthening the model of capitalist
accumulation and exploitation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Among the climate denialists are Trump, the Republican Party and the Tea
Party in the United States, Bolsonaro in Brazil, and a small minority of
scientists. [But its driving force is the multinational corporations
that bear the greatest responsibility for emitting greenhouse gases that
cause climate change]{.underline}. Yet while they are sponsoring climate
denial campaigns, [[these large capitalist corporations are completely
aware of the consequences of climate change and its socio-political
effects, and they are preparing to respond to its implications in the
fields of security and foreign policy.]{.mark} The most concentrated
sectors of capital are proposing militarization as an instrument to
adapt to climate change: more private armies and security forces that
will eventually be able to defend the islands of prosperity in oceans of
misery and decay.]{.underline}

On the other side is green capitalism, promoted by the U.S. Democratic
Party, political leaders of the main European countries including Angela
Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Pedro Sánchez, and various green parties.
This list includes many booming capitalist corporations, international
organizations and even environmental NGOs. This is an exercise in
synergy between neoliberalism and the "green economy." They speak out
against global warming and agree, in expensive climate summits, on
environmental measures and big targets for emission reduction. In all
cases, these have been nothing more than diplomatic documents without
practical implications.

[At the same time, they talk about fixing the environment. This would
include limiting the production of toxic substances and the destruction
of natural resources, while simultaneously developing new "gentle"
technologies. [They argue that this would be a new source of economic
growth, since the capitalist corporations would extract hefty
profits.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Green Party in Germany, for example, proposes "saving the German
economy" with measures for an ecological transition, while supporting
the militarization of German imperialism (they called for intervention
in the conflict with Iran under European leadership). This is a policy
of "green imperialism" to solve the crisis of German capitalism.

One of the most recent measures of this kind, pushed forward by the
Merkel government and the Green Party in Germany, but increasingly
adopted by other governments and environmental groups, seeks to
implement a tax on CO2 emissions. This would tax consumption of meat,
gasoline and flights to finance the ecological transition of industry.
[[This kind of tax would lead to a rise in prices and weaken the
purchasing power of the working class, but it would not have a serious
effect on emissions. In short, the neoliberal strategy of green
capitalism ends up being a sort of light denialism.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Capitalism's very essence is the expansion of profit and accumulation
at any cost, even if this includes the material destruction of the
planet]{.mark}. As China and the United States, together with the
European Union, are producing most of the greenhouse gases that are
annihilating the troposphere, and the capitalists waver between denial
and powerless summits to manage the environmental crisis, the rest of
the world continues to suffer the effects of climate
change.]{.underline}

[[That is why green capitalism is a pipe dream. It claims to effectively
eliminate the causes of the global environmental catastrophe that
threatens us and promote a sustainable development of humanity and the
species that populate the planet. But it can do no such thing. The
solution to the global climate crisis cannot emerge from the system that
created it.]{.underline}]{.mark}

There are a large number of environmental groups and NGOs in this field,
including the IUCN, WWF, and even Greenpeace, that work together with
the evangelists of capitalist ecological efficiency: oil companies like
Shell and Exxon, mining corporations like Barrick Gold and huge
behemoths like Walmart, Cargill and Monsanto. In this way, they provide
a "green" cover for the plunder of natural resources all over the
planet.

### 2NC \-- AT: Cap Good - War

#### Capitalism paves the path for proliferation [and]{.underline} war

**Robinson, 22** William Robinson, PhD, 1-6-2022, Truthout, \"Global
Capitalism Has Become Dependent on War-Making to Sustain Itself\",
<https://truthout.org/articles/global-capitalism-has-become-dependent-on-war-making-to-sustain-itself/)->
FT

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has sparked fierce political debate on
the geopolitical consequences of the conflict. **[But less noticed and
equally as important, the [war has paved the way for]{.mark} a more
sweeping [militarization]{.mark} of what was already a global war
economy mired in deep political and economic crisis.]{.underline}**
Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts may be tragic for
those caught up in conflagrations such as in Ukraine **[--- but
advantageous for those seeking to legitimize expanding military and
security budgets and open up new opportunities for capitalist
profit-making in the face of chronic stagnation and social discontent.
[In late March]{.mark}, the [Biden]{.mark} administration, citing the
Russian invasion, [called for a \$31 billion increase in]{.mark} the
[Pentagon budget]{.mark} over the previous year and on top of an
emergency appropriation weeks earlier of \$14 billion for Ukraine's
defense.]{.underline}** Prior to the invasion, in late 2021, the U.S.
government approved a nearly \$800 billion military budget, even as, in
the same year, it ended the war in Afghanistan. Almost overnight
following the Russian invasion, the U.S., European Union, and other
governments around the world allocated billions of dollars in additional
military spending and sent streams of military hardware and private
military contractors into Ukraine. Shares of military and security firms
surged in the wake of the invasion. **[Two weeks into the conflict,
[shares of Raytheon were up 8 percent]{.mark}, [General Dynamics]{.mark}
up [12 percent]{.mark}, [Lockheed Martin]{.mark} up [18 percent]{.mark}
[and Northrop Grumman]{.mark} up [22 percent]{.mark}, while [war stocks
in]{.mark} [Europe, India]{.mark}, and elsewhere [experienced]{.mark}
similar [surges]{.mark} in expectation of an exponential rise in global
military spending]{.underline}**. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in
the words of the managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, a Pentagon
contractor, is "unquestionably the best F-35 salesman of all time," in
reference to a spike in U.S. government funding for the Lockheed Martin
jet fighter. Said one consultant to Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed
Martin and Raytheon Technologies: "For the defense industry, happy days
are here again. When the defense budget rises it tends to lift all boats
in the industry." The Russian invasion --- brutal, reckless and
condemnable by any standard --- has sparked debate on NATO's proposed
expansion into Ukraine and the role that it played in motivating the
Kremlin. U.S. officials were keenly aware, in fact, that the drive to
expand NATO to Russian borders would eventually push Moscow into a
military conflict. "We examine a wide range of nonviolent measures that
could exploit Russia's actual vulnerabilities and anxieties as a way of
stressing Russia's military and economy and the regime's political
standing at home and abroad," notes a 2019 study by the RAND
Corporation, a Pentagon-affiliated think tank. "The steps we examine
would not have either defense or deterrence as their prime purpose," it
states, but rather, "these steps are conceived of as elements in a
campaign designed to unbalance the adversary, leading Russia to compete
in domains or regions where the United States has a competitive
advantage, and causing Russia to overextend itself militarily or
economically." But the provocation could not be reduced to geopolitical
competition, however important, as most observers were keen to do.
Missing from the larger picture was the centrality of militarized
accumulation --- of endless low- and high-intensity warfare, simmering
conflicts, civil strife and policing --- to the global political
economy. **[Militarized accumulation refers to a situation in which a
global war economy relies on the state to organize war-making, social
control and repression to sustain capital accumulation in the face of
chronic stagnation and saturation of global markets.]{.underline}**
These state-organized practices are outsourced to transnational
corporate capital, involving the fusion of private accumulation with
state militarization in order to sustain the process of capital
accumulation. **[[Cycles of destruction]{.mark} and [reconstruction
provide ongoing outlets for over-accumulated
capita]{.mark}l]{.underline}**; that is, these cycles open up new
profit-making opportunities for transnational capitalists seeking
ongoing opportunities to profitably reinvest the enormous amounts of
cash they have accumulated. There is a convergence in this process of
global capitalism's political need for social control and repression in
the face of mounting popular discontent worldwide and its economic need
to perpetuate accumulation in the face of stagnation. **[[Wars
provide]{.mark} critical [economic stimulus]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[[They]{.mark} have historically [pull]{.mark}ed the
[cap]{.mark}italist system [out of]{.mark} accumulation [crises while
they]{.mark} serve to [deflect attention from political tensions]{.mark}
and problems of legitimacy.]{.underline}** [It took
**[W]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[orld [W]{.mark}ar [II to]{.mark} finally
[lift world cap]{.mark}italism [out of the Great
Depression]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[The Cold War legitimated]{.mark}
a half century of [expanding military budgets]{.mark} and the
Iraq/Afghanistan wars]{.underline}**, the longest in history, helped
keep the economy sputtering along in the face of chronic stagnation in
the first two decades of the century. From the anti-Communist fervor of
the Cold War, to the "war on terror," then the so-called New Cold War,
and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the transnational elite, led by
Washington, **[have had to conjure up one enemy after another to
legitimate militarized accumulation and deflect crises of state
legitimacy and capitalist hegemony onto external enemies and contrived
threats.]{.underline}** The events of September 11, 2001, marked the
start of an era of a permanent global war in which logistics, warfare,
intelligence, repression, surveillance and even military personnel are
more and more the privatized domain of transnational capital. **[[The
Pentagon budget increased 91 percent]{.mark} in real terms [between
1998]{.mark} and [2011]{.mark}, while worldwide, total state military
budget outlays grew by 50 percent from 2006 to 2015, from \$1.4 trillion
to more than \$2 trillion.]{.underline}** (This figure does not take
into account the hundreds of billions of dollars spent on intelligence;
contingency operations; policing; bogus wars against immigrants,
terrorism and drugs; and "homeland security.") During this time,
military-industrial complex profits quadrupled. However, focusing just
on state military budgets only gives us a part of the picture of the
global war economy. As I showed in my 2020 book, **[[The Global Police
State]{.mark}, the various wars, conflicts and campaigns of social
control and repression around the world [involve]{.mark} [the fusion of
private accumulation with state militarization.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
In this relationship, the state facilitates the expansion of
opportunities for private capital to accumulate through militarization,
such as by facilitating global weapons sales by
military-industrial-security firms, the amounts of which have reached
unprecedented levels. **[[Global weapons sales]{.mark} by the top 100
weapons manufacturers and military service companies [increased by 38
percent between 2002]{.mark} and [2016]{.mark}]{.underline}** and can be
expected to escalate further in the face of a prolonged war in Ukraine.
By 2018, private for-profit military companies employed some 15 million
people around the world, while another 20 million people worked in
private security worldwide. The private security (policing) business is
one of the fastest-growing economic sectors in many countries and has
come to dwarf public security around the world. The amount spent on
private security in 2003, the year of the invasion of Iraq, was 73
percent higher than that spent in the public sphere, and three times as
many persons were employed in private forces as in official law
enforcement agencies. In half of the world's countries, private security
agents outnumber police officers. These corporate soldiers and police
were deployed to guard corporate property, provide personal security for
executives and their families; collect data; conduct police,
paramilitary, counterinsurgency and surveillance operations; carry out
mass crowd control and repression of protesters; run private detention
and interrogation facilities; manage prisons and participate in outright
warfare. **[Now, [these same private]{.mark} military and security
[firms are pouring into Ukraine]{.mark}, with some mercenary companies
offering between \$1,000 and \$2,000]{.underline}** a day for those with
combat experience. The Russian invasion has accelerated but did not
originate the ongoing surge in military spending around the world. It is
notable that state military spending worldwide skyrocketed in the wake
of the 2008 global financial collapse even beyond the post-9/11 spending
hike, rising from about \$1.5 billion in 2008 to over \$2 trillion in
2022. The fact that this explosion in spending coincides perfectly with
continued worldwide stagnation following the Great Recession suggests
that the heightened militarization of the global economy is as much or
more a response to this chronic stagnation than to perceived security
threats. If bursts of militarized accumulation (such as that unleashed
by 9/11, then by the 2008 financial collapse, and now by the Russian
invasion) help offset the overaccumulation crisis further into the
future, they are also high-risk bets that heighten worldwide tensions
and push the world dangerously towards all-out international
conflagration. **[This [crisis of global cap]{.mark}italism [is
economic]{.mark}, or [structural]{.mark}, one of [chronic stagnation in
the global econ]{.mark}omy.]{.underline}** But it is also political: a
crisis of state legitimacy and capitalist hegemony. **[The system is
moving towards "a general crisis of capitalist rule" as billions of
people around the world face uncertain struggles for survival and
question a system they no longer see as legitimate. Historically, [wars
have pulled]{.mark} the [cap]{.mark}italist system [out of
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}** while they serve to deflect attention from
political tensions and problems of legitimacy. Economically, global
capitalism faces what is known in technical language as
"overaccumulation": a situation in which the economy has produced --- or
has the capacity to produce --- great quantities of wealth but the
market cannot absorb this wealth because of escalating inequality.
**[Capitalism by its very nature will produce abundant wealth yet
polarize that wealth]{.underline}** and generate ever greater levels of
social inequality unless offset by redistributive policies. The level of
global social polarization and inequality now experienced is without
precedent. In 2018, the richest 1 percent of humanity controlled more
than half of the world's wealth while the bottom 80 percent had to make
do with just 5 percent. The international development agency Oxfam
reported in January that during the first two years of the coronavirus
pandemic, **[[the 10 richest men]{.mark} in the world more than [doubled
their fortunes]{.mark}, from \$700 billion to \$1.5 trillion, while [99
percent of humanity saw a fall in]{.mark} their
[income]{.mark}]{.underline}** and 160 million more people fell into
poverty. Such inequalities end up undermining the stability of the
system as the gap grows between what is --- or could be --- produced and
what the market can absorb. **[The extreme concentration of the planet's
wealth in the hands of the few and the accelerated impoverishment and
dispossession of the majority means that the transnational capitalist
class, or TCC, has increasing difficulty in finding productive
outlets]{.underline}** to unload enormous amounts of surplus it
accumulated. In the years leading up to the pandemic, there was a steady
rise in underutilized capacity and a slowdown in industrial production
around the world. The surplus of accumulated capital with nowhere to go
expanded rapidly. Transnational corporations recorded record profits
during the 2010s at the same time that corporate investment declined.
Along with militarized accumulation, the TCC has turned to unprecedented
levels of financial speculation and to debt-driven growth to sustain
profit-making in the face of the crisis. **[If left unchecked,
[overaccumulation results in crisis]{.mark} --- in stagnation,
recessions, depressions, social upheavals and war]{.underline}** ---
just what we are experiencing right now. But there is a related dynamic
at work in the global war economy: the need for dominant groups to
suppress mass discontent and deflect the crisis of state legitimacy.
International frictions escalate as states, in their efforts to retain
legitimacy, seek to sublimate social and political tensions and to keep
the social order from fracturing. All around the world, a "people's
Spring" has taken off. From Chile to Lebanon, Iraq to India, France to
the United States, Haiti to Nigeria, South Africa to Colombia, Jordan to
Sri Lanka, waves of strikes and mass protests have proliferated and, in
some instances, appear to be acquiring an anti-capitalist character.
**[Wars and external enemies allow the ruling groups to deflect
attention away from domestic malaise in their effort to maintain a grip
on power as the crisis deepens.]{.underline}** In the U.S., this
sublimation has involved efforts to channel social unrest towards
scapegoated communities such as immigrants or other marginalized groups
--- this is one key function of racism and was a core component of the
Trump government's political strategy --- or towards an external enemy
such as China or Russia, which had clearly become a cornerstone of the
Biden government's strategy well before the Russian invasion of
Ukraine**[. [U.S.]{.mark} presidents historically [reach their highest
approval ratings when they launch wars]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[George
W. B[ush reached an all-time-high of 90 percent in
2001]{.mark}]{.underline}** as his administration geared up to invade
Afghanistan, and **[his father [George H.W. Bush achieved]{.mark} an [89
percent approval]{.mark} rating [in 1991]{.mark}]{.underline}**, right
as the U.S. declared the end of its (first) invasion of Iraq and the
"liberation of Kuwait." **[It is unlikely that an increasing
militarization of the world economy can in the long run offset either
the economic or the political dimensions of the crisis of global
capitalism.]{.underline}** **[[Global cap]{.mark}italism [is
emerging]{.mark} from the [corona]{.mark}virus pandemic [with more
inequality]{.mark}, more authoritarianism, more militarization, and more
civic and political strife]{.underline}**. In the U\\.S., class struggle
is heating up, with a wave of strikes and of unionization drives in
Amazon, Starbucks, and elsewhere in the gig economy. The current
inflationary spiral and the escalation of class struggle in the United
States and around the world point to the inability of the ruling groups
to contain the expanding crisis. The drive by the capitalist state to
externalize the political fallout of the crisis increases the danger
that international tensions and localized conflicts such as in Ukraine
will snowball into broader international conflagrations of unforeseen
consequences. As the Ukraine crisis continues to drag on and the global
revolt escalates, there will be a radical reconfiguration of global
geopolitical alignments to the drumbeat of escalating turbulence in the
world economy that will feed new political upheavals and violent
conflicts, making global capitalism all the more volatile. While it is
hard to imagine a return to the status quo antebellum in Eastern Europe,
in the larger picture, **[the [Ukraine crisis is not the cause but a
consequence]{.mark} of the general crisis [of global capitalism]{.mark}.
That crisis will only get worse. Fasten your seat belts; it will get
much worse.]{.underline}**

#### Capitalism doesn't act as a deterrent 

**Meyerson**, 20**22** (Harold, editor at large at *The American
Prospect*. "Old Lessons Learned Anew: Cross-Border Capitalism Doesn't
Deter Wars" The American Prospect, March 8, 2022.
<https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/old-lesson-learned-anew-cross-border-capitalism-doesnt-deter-war/>
///MF)

[[Among the terrible casualties of Russia's war on Ukraine, there's
one---and so far as I can see, only one---that deserved to die: the myth
that cross-border economic integration (or, more accurately, the
creation of a global capitalist order of production, trade, and
consumption) will deter wars.]{.mark} As my colleague Bob
Kuttner [wrote](https://prospect.org/world/end-of-globalism/) in
his Prospect column today, that idea has been violently dispelled in the
past two weeks, much as it was in the summer of 1914.]{.underline}

As Bob also noted, [the belief that the creation of cross-border
European investment and culture in the first decade or so of the 20th
century would deter future wars was profound.]{.underline} Norman
Angell's 1910 book The Great Illusion made that case very compelling to
Europe's elites. I'd stress, however, that it's usually elites---those
who either gain from cross-border investments, or those in a position to
access the best of different nations' cultures---that buy into this
myth. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Wagner's operas were
viewed as a defining high point of European culture, notwithstanding
their German nationalism and antisemitism. Indeed, as cultural historian
Carl Schorske documented in his terrific history Fin-de-Siècle Vienna,
it was Theodor Herzl's love---not hate---of Wagner that helped inspire
him to lead the Zionist cause. Just as improbable, the first production
of Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion---on, among other things, the class basis of
differences in British speech---took place in 1913 in Vienna in German
translation, one year before it first opened in English in London. (In
later years, Shaw noted that it had been impossible to
translate Pygmalion into Swedish, because Sweden's economic
egalitarianism had obliterated class differences in speech.)

[More from Harold
Meyerson](https://prospect.org/topics/harold-meyerson/)

But then, cosmopolitanism and select cross-border cultural appropriation
has historically been more of an option for the wealthy---note how
Tolstoy's Russian aristocrats speak French. As the 20th century
progressed, that option spread among the well-educated and, in the 21st
century, the well-wired. Today, the gap between more prosperous and
cosmopolitan cities and more impoverished, provincial, and nationalistic
rural areas increasingly defines politics throughout the world.

That said[, the [belief that we're on the brink of some war-deterring
global harmony has been, first and foremost, a claim made by
international investors and their advocates, who also insisted that the
coming of capitalism to Russia and China would mean that those nations
would ipso facto become democracies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whether the
Wall Street bankers who most assiduously promoted this myth actually
believed it or just felt it was politically necessary remains a somewhat
unsettled question. By dint of their universal opposition to unions,
none of them seem inclined even to tolerate a smidgen of democracy
within the workplaces they control.

But a different species of globalization has also grown over more recent
decades, as a common culture has taken root, chiefly among the urban
young. Some of it is merely an immersion in capitalist consumer culture,
but some of it is also a belief in liberal and democratic norms, which
we see displayed among the anti-war demonstrators who keep coming out to
the Red Squares of Moscow and other Russian cities despite their
knowledge that they risk imprisonment. The globalization we have yet to
see, alas, is the one that Marx called for in the closing line of
the Manifesto, that of the workers of the world. Capital can easily
cross borders, which has also become increasingly the case in recent
decades for professionals. But once the production workers of Pittsburgh
were pitted against the production workers of Shenzhen in the absence of
global work standards and global worker rights, a proletarian
we're-all-in-this-together sensibility wasn't likely to emerge. And it
isn't, so long as workers aren't protected against the transnational
arbitrage that is the very heart of global capitalism.

[And now, as in 1914, we learn again that global [capitalism not only
facilitates a nationalist reaction among workers, but also is no
deterrent to wars.]{.mark} So much for the Peace of the
Action.]{.underline}

#### Cap has brought to the brink of nuc war, specifically with Russia 

**Damon**, 20**22** (Andre, writer and editor with a focus on economics
and geopolitics. "Capitalism normalizes death: From Covid-19 to the
threat of nuclear war" WSWS. April 8, 2022.
https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/04/09/pers-a09.html)

In 1963, Barry Goldwater, the future Republican Party nominee for
President of the United States, published a book titled Why Not
Victory? In it, he argued that the United States was insufficiently
aggressive in confronting the Soviet Union because the American
population was too fearful of nuclear war.

The 1953 \"Grable\" nuclear test conducted by the United States in
Nevada.

"A craven fear of death is entering the American consciousness,"
Goldwater wrote, "We want to stay alive, of course; but more than that
we want to be free."

In the following year's presidential campaign, Democratic candidate
Lyndon B. Johnson countered Goldwater's slogan, "In your heart, you know
he\'s right," with the rhyme, "In your heart, you know he
might"---implying that Goldwater might end human civilization by using
nuclear weapons.

The Johnson campaign\'s 1964 \"daisy\" ad

The Johnson campaign ran the famous "daisy" political ad, showing a
young girl picking petals from a flower and counting aloud, before
cutting to a missile launch countdown and a nuclear explosion.

Commenting on Goldwater's campaign, the American political theorist
Richard Hofstadter wrote, "What had become clear by 1964, and what could
not be undone in the campaign, was the public impression that
Goldwater's imagination had never confronted the implications of
thermonuclear war." Goldwater, Hofstadter wrote, "seemed strangely
casual about the prospect of total destruction."

[More than half a century after the 1964 presidential race, [the United
States and Russia are engaged in a deadly proxy war over Ukraine,
threatening to spill over into full-scale conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}
As the war spins out of control, significant sections of the US
political establishment are again, to use Hofstadter's phrase,
"strangely casual about the prospect of total destruction."

It is not merely Goldwater's political progeny on the far right, but the
entire political establishment that is flirting with the prospect of a
nuclear apocalypse. With no input from the population or serious public
discussion, the US government is taking a series of actions that
threaten the most devastating consequences.

[[The present threat of nuclear war between the United States and Russia
is, however, only the violent eruption to the surface of systematic
preparations for nuclear war that have been years in the
making.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[With no public debate and with no opposition within the political
establishment, three successive presidents have made sweeping,
far-reaching preparations for using nuclear weapons in combat to target
Russia and China.]{.underline}

In 2016, President Barack Obama initiated the most dramatic expansion
and modernization of America's nuclear forces since the end of the Cold
War, at a projected cost of \$1.2 trillion.

[Obama's nuclear arms race sparked what commentators at the time called
the "second nuclear age]{.underline}." In contrast to the Cold War's
doctrine of "mutually assured destruction," this "second nuclear age"
would, in the words of a 2016 report by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, involve combatants "thinking through how they
might actually employ a nuclear weapon, both early in a conflict and in
a discriminate manner."

To this end, Obama's nuclear modernization program involved the
construction of low-yield nuclear weapons that, in the hopes of US
military theorists, could actually be used in combat without triggering
a full-scale thermonuclear exchange.

In addition to making nuclear weapons smaller, lighter, less destructive
and more portable, the corollary of making "usable" nuclear weapons was
the scrapping of restrictions on shorter-range weapons.

In 2018, the Trump administration intensified the arms race initiated
under Obama by unilaterally withdrawing from the Intermediate Range
Nuclear Forces Treaty, freeing the United States to ring Russia and
China with short-range nuclear weapons capable of hitting major cities
in a matter of minutes. This was accompanied by the systematic expansion
of the US nuclear modernization program, the cost of which subsequently
ballooned to nearly \$2 trillion.

[[The Biden administration has doubled down on the nuclear preparations
of its predecessors, and Biden's proposed 2023 budget calls for creating
new versions of every single weapons system in the US nuclear
"triad]{.underline}."]{.mark} While Biden eschews the "fire and fury"
rhetoric of his predecessor, his administration has been even more
aggressive in provoking conflicts with Russia and China than either
Obama or Trump.

In 2021, the White House signed the US-Ukraine Strategic Partnership,
announced on September 1, 2021, which declared that the US would "never
recognize Russia's attempted annexation of Crimea." The agreement was
signed just months after Ukraine made the retaking of the Donbas
official state doctrine, all but announcing a planned Ukrainian war
against Russia.

At the same time, the administration has systematically worked to
undermine the One China policy, with Biden pledging in a town hall
meeting to defend Taiwan from China. Last year, the Nikkei published
reports that the United States was working on plans to station nuclear
weapons on the "first island chain," including Japan and Taiwan.

[But with the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, the
far-reaching plans for "great power conflict" prepared behind the backs
of the population are now being put into effect, confronting humanity
with the threat of nuclear annihilation.]{.underline}

Echoing the 1963 declaration by Barry Goldwater, Philip Breedlove,
NATO's former supreme allied commander in Europe, told Voice of America
this week: "We have been so worried about nuclear weapons and World War
III that we have allowed ourselves to be fully deterred. And \[Putin\]
frankly, is completely undeterred."

The inevitable conclusion is that the population must accept the threat
of nuclear war and overcome its "craven fear of death."

The utter casualness and total recklessness with which the US political
establishment is treating the prospect of a war that threatens to
escalate into a full-scale nuclear exchange is of a piece with the
ruling class's indifference to mass death in the pandemic.

One million Americans have died of COVID-19 since January 2020. In a
typical month, 37,000 Americans lost their lives, the equivalent of
twelve 9/11 attacks.

A significant attribute of media commentary on the pandemic in the
United States was the claim that the struggle to preserve life, the
first right enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, is synonymous
with "fear."

New York Times writer David Leonhardt has made this insinuation his
specialty. In column after column prematurely declaring the pandemic
over and claiming that COVID-19 is less harmful than the seasonal flu,
Leonhardt has referred to "irrational Covid fears," demanding to know,
"Why do so many vaccinated people remain fearful?"

Commenting on the relationship between the pandemic and
war, Bloomberg observed last year: "Yes, the U.S. has botched its
response to COVID-19. At the same time, its experience shows that
America as a nation can in fact tolerate casualties, too many in fact.
It had long been standard Chinese doctrine that Americans are 'soft' and
unwilling to take on much risk. If you were a Chinese war game planner,
might you now reconsider that assumption?"

In other words, COVID-19 has cheapened life in America. One million
people are dead, and the US media and political establishment simply
ignore the death toll. Mass death is simply expected to become part of
the background noise.

This paradigm shift is not being discussed, it is simply imposed upon
the population through propaganda. Nowhere does anyone in the media ask:
What would a nuclear war between the United States and Russia look like?

Earlier this year, James Stavridis, NATO's former supreme allied
commander in Europe, published a novel about a fictional future nuclear
war. Describing an American nuclear attack on Shanghai, Stavridis wrote:
"These many months later the city remained a charred, radioactive
wasteland. The death toll had exceeded thirty million. After each of the
nuclear attacks international markets plummeted. Crops failed.
Infectious diseases spread. Radiation poisoning promised to contaminate
generations. The devastation exceeded... capacity for comprehension."

The American survivors of a Chinese nuclear attack on San Diego are left
to live in "wretched camps," where "cyclical outbreaks of typhus,
measles, and even smallpox often sprouted from the unbilged latrines and
rows of plastic tenting."

Since the publication of his book, Stavridis has become a regular on the
Sunday talk shows, where he expostulates on the crimes and cruelties of
America's enemies, whom he has dubbed the "butchers of Bucha."

No one interrupts him to ask about the relevance of the description of
nuclear war contained in his book to the growing threat of a Third World
War. Rather, the news is full of war propaganda, designed to work upon
the emotions of the population and incite it to support actions that
threaten a war between the two largest nuclear powers.

The total devaluation of human life, the indifference to mass death in
the pandemic and the recklessness with which American capitalism is
rushing into conflict with Russia reflect the views and social character
of the American ruling class. This parasitic oligarchy feasts upon the
impoverishment and exploitation of the working population.

Living on financial speculation made possible by a credit bubble
inflated by the Federal Reserve, fearing and hating the working
population of America and the world, the American ruling class is as
desperate and reckless as it is ruthless.

The central question is what will develop more quickly: the war drive of
the capitalist oligarchy or the growing global rebellion of the working
class.

Throughout the world, the surging prices of food and energy have
produced outpourings of working class opposition, such as the mass
demonstrations against the Rajapakse government in Sri Lanka. As workers
enter into struggle, they must take up the demands of fighting to end
the COVID-19 pandemic and opposing the war threats of the capitalist
oligarchy.

#### Climate crisis comes first -- prioritizing space col locks in extinction 

**Temmen 21** (Jens Temmen is an assistant professor at the American
Studies department at Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf ,"WHY
BILLIONAIRES IN SPACE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE",

The question ignores the fact that contrary to what the private space
industry (and national space agencies, for that matter) wants us to
believe, **[[the exploration and colonization of outer space is]{.mark}
a very terrestrial undertaking. [Steeped in
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- a system that Branson, Musk and
Bezos have mastered and thrived in -- and the geopolitical stratagems of
Earth's nation-states, **[[space exploration]{.mark} today [is
not]{.mark} so much [driven by changing humanity as it goes into
space]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} rather by changing outer space [to make it
fit into the logics of profit and territorial control on
Earth]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And we are in the thick of it: Branson's
latest attempt to establish space travel as a new branch of the tourism
industry is just one of many recent steps -- including the establishment
of US Space Force, the ratification of the Artemis Accords, and **[the
signing on of Musk's SpaceX as a contractor for NASA]{.underline}** --
**[to make outer space safe for capitalism]{.underline}**. The point of
the performative character of the billionaires' space race, the images
of grandeur and individualism, the bells and whistles, its alleged
subscription to a more just future for humanity, is to distract, then.
It is a shiny packaging that wraps-up and obscures the mundane fact that
if **[colonizing outer space is allegedly about fundamentally changing
societally structures that govern Earth and humanity, the New Space
Entrepreneurs are certainly not the ones to bring about that change --
it would simply be against their self-interest.]{.underline}** In
Earth's past and present, the colonial language of virgin land and terra
nullius served to obscure the human cost of colonization by dehumanizing
colonized peoples. Space exploration, as imagined by Branson, Musk and
Bezos, also has a cost. The wealth that all three of them have acquired
through their business ventures, which puts them into the position to
reach for the stars (and greater profits), **[[builds on]{.mark}
unleashed neoliberalism, [capitalist exploitation,]{.mark} and, overall,
less-than altruistic business models. [Their vision of humanity in space
is]{.mark} likewise [designed for the few and wealthy,]{.mark} and built
on the back of the many.]{.underline}** And the cost could increase even
further. **[[While all of humanity is facing the unprecedented threat of
climate change]{.mark}, which urges us to find sustainable solutions
fast, [Elon Musk and others offer us the seemingly quick fix of
abandoning Earth altogether and to weather out the storm on
Mars]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In spite of being completely unfeasible
from a scientific standpoint, the idea has still gained traction among
technoliberalists, and is thus withdrawing attention and resources from
communities mostly in the Global South for whom climate change is not a
threat in the distant future. In addition, **[[the noise and smoke
created by]{.mark} the hyper-masculine performances of [Branson, Musk
and Bezos block our view of the]{.mark} tangible [benefits that space
exploration has to offer]{.mark} and that we should readily invest in.
[Current]{.mark} Mars [exploration projects]{.mark}, for example, [offer
insights into how atmospheric changes impact planetary climates --
information that could prove invaluable in our battle against climate
change on Earth]{.mark}.]{.underline}** All of this is a reminder that
we should not abandon the idea altogether that space exploration can
offer us new and vital insights. **[Space exploration is, however, not
going to magically change humanity or how we live. If we want to
continue to hope that space exploration will fulfill the promise of a
better future for humanity, [changing our perspectives on life on Earth
must come first.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Space col is driving the rest of humanity into extinction -- the billionaires must be stopped

**[[Between]{.mark} [the]{.mark} climate crisis, [various accelerating
social crises]{.mark}, and the ongoing pandemic, [humanity faces immense
challenges that must be tackled]{.mark} in the coming
decade.]{.underline}** State power will be required to direct resources
into building a sustainable economy, reconstructing the crumbling social
infrastructure, and ensuring a good standard of living for all --- but
billionaires have no stake in any of those projects. **[[Space
colonisation will do nothing to address these crises, regardless of the
promises]{.mark} of billionaires and luxury communists alike. When they
talk about how asteroid mining will bring great wealth to be shared with
all or to power the green technologies that are heralded as climate
solutions free of sacrifice for Western consumers, they're simply
distracting us from the difficult work that must be done if we're to
truly address the social and environmental challenges of our time. We
already know that emissions need to be cut in half by 2030. That means
our societies need to be radically overhauled long before asteroid
mining becomes feasible --- if it ever does. [Green capitalists]{.mark}
like Musk are happy to sell us a false future of electric cars and
solar-powered suburbia that allow them to profit in the short-term
because they [can simply seal themselves off from the rest of the
population when the effects of a warming climate accelerate]{.mark}. The
capitalist logic of infinite growth that's driving the desire for space
colonisation is the same one that's created the very problems we so
desperately need to solve in the first place, and doubling down on it
would be a terrible mistake. We should be particularly wary of aligning
ourselves with a coalition that includes billionaires and right-wing
politicians who make explicit comparisons to past colonisation projects,
too: Ted Cruz, for example, has promoted space as 'as vast and promising
a frontier as the New World was some centuries ago'. That's not to say
that humanity should turn away from the stars. We should continue
funding space science, but the expansion of capitalism into space and
the exploitation of extraterrestrial resources do not serve those goals.
Justifying space colonisation through the need for a second planet is a
self-fulfilling prophecy created by people who have little regard for
the lives and wellbeing of the global working class --- as the pandemic
has demonstrated. [Capitalism is driving billionaires toward space as it
drives the rest of us toward extinction]{.mark}. They must be stopped
before it is too late.]{.underline}**

[When French economist Thomas Piketty declared the [21st century]{.mark}
a new "[gilded age]{.mark}" in his seminal work, Capital in the
Twenty-First Century, he was acutely [aware of]{.mark} the
[impact]{.mark} that [mass wealth accumulation had on human rights and
equality]{.mark} across the globe.]{.underline} While proponents of
capitalism have long argued that, in its purest form, capitalism can
bring about healthy competition, egalitarianism, and accessibility, [the
late-stage [capitalism]{.mark} that, at present, [dominates the global
system]{.mark}, has instead become a means of **[exploitation for those
at the bottom]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In light of the ongoing pandemic
and climate crisis, which have only [further exposed the [ills of
capitalism]{.mark} and widened the disparities between the so-called
"haves and have nots," the [entire system is due for serious
re-evaluation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

CAPITALIST STRUCTURE

[While [capitalism]{.mark} comes in many forms, the central tenets that
underpin capitalist systems are common [amongst almost all market
economies]{.mark}]{.underline}. The structure of capitalist [economies
is dependent upon the following: maximisation of profit, the [existence
of private property]{.mark}, free and accessible markets, market
mechanisms that self-correct,]{.underline} and the free exchange of
labour and services vis-à-vis the division of labour. Additionally,
behavioral economists have emphasised the role of intangible elements
like "self-interest," which drive the market forward and push
individuals toward innovation and competition. In today's economy, [this
"self-interest" is realised in the spirit of entrepreneurship that
supposedly bolsters the free exchange of goods and services. However,
what the pandemic and [current global system]{.mark} have
[revealed]{.mark} is something far [more
siniste]{.mark}]{.underline}[r]{.mark}. Without due and enforceable
regulation, the most obvious of the aforementioned tenets, [maximisation
of profit has become a means of exploitation and exists to the detriment
of human rights across the world and has forced the question: can human
rights and capitalism coexist?]{.underline}

PROFIT PRINCIPLES

[Perhaps the most [central idea]{.mark} that upholds [capitalist]{.mark}
economies [is]{.mark} the [maximisation of profit]{.mark}. Human rights
have taken a back seat as companies and individuals seek to maximise
their financial gain and fulfill their corporate mandate to maximise
shareholder profit]{.underline}. In a globalised economy, the
[**[maximisation of profit]{.mark} has been [linked to]{.mark} a "[race
to the bottom]{.mark}**[,"]{.mark} wherein companies seek the cheapest
labour possible and export primary production to countries typically
located in the Global South where a **[lack of]{.mark} enforced
[regulation]{.mark} on industry and labour [leads to serious
abuses]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This phenomenon produces the images we
see today of overcrowded, unventilated garment factories and unsafe
mining conditions across Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America[. In
this system, abuses are not only tolerated but profitable.]{.underline}

**[But, [who profits? Certainly not workers]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
According to the latest report by the International Labour Organization,
[millions of workers around the world reside in countries where no
minimum wage exists and where **[labour standards]{.mark} are [either
dismal or effectively nonexistent]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

#### Capitalism and human rights abuses go together like yin and yang -- colonialism, expansion and violence all run rampant under capitalism

Alan **Song 15** \[Alan Song, 3-10-2015, \"Capitalism and human rights
abuses go together like yin and yang,\" New Internationalist,
https://newint.org/blog/2015/03/10/capitalism-abuse, smarx, HHW\]

When discrediting a social movement or a political entity, the
[[powers]{.mark}-that-be will [often point]{.mark} to [how
violent]{.mark} it is, as a way to delegitimize it.]{.underline}

[A [popular criticism of communism]{.mark}, which still lingers today,
years after the fall of the Iron Curtain, is that it was inherently
violent.]{.underline}

Anti-communist, pro-capitalist propagandists will point to the violent
nature of Stalin's five-year-plans or to Pol Pot's social cleansing.
'Look, it's all well and good in theory, but in practice it's the most
violent system,' they say. Capitalism, on the other hand, is the
religion of peace.

[This [simplistic logic]{.mark} is not only [grossly flawed]{.mark} but
contributes to a convenient narrative to delegitimize any movement that
is not pro-markets,]{.underline} which has been the status quo since the
end of the Second World War.

In that period, [[capitalist economics]{.mark} have **[become the modus
operandi]{.mark} for the Western world** [and]{.mark} have been
(**[violently) pushed onto the rest of the world]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
This has become so accepted as the triumphant system over the evils of
communism, that the end of the Cold War was famously (and incorrectly)
regarded as 'The End of History' by US political scientist and economist
Francis Fukuyama.

[**What this [narrative]{.mark} does, though, is [whitewash the crimes
of capitalism]{.mark}**, which is conveniently exonerated of its sins,
while an association is made between violence and any alternative
system, so as to continue to **[position capitalism on higher moral and
economic ground]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

On closer inspection, however, it is difficult to disagree with the fact
that [**[capitalism]{.mark} is almost [undoubtedly the most violent
economic system]{.mark} of recent times**, responsible for more deaths
and more social disruption [than any other.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Even if in much of the industrialized and developed capitalist word
[there is the veneer of a state of peace, **[capitalism]{.mark}, as a
system, [is maintained]{.mark} and upheld [through violence]{.mark},**
both overtly and in more subtle ways.]{.underline}

[Western [expansion, slavery and colonialism]{.mark} are [inherently
tied to]{.mark} white, patriarchal, [capitalist]{.mark}
[economics]{.mark} that are still in play today. [Capitalism]{.mark} has
[claimed millions of lives]{.mark} and has [led to]{.mark}
violence]{.underline} as a result of structural adjustment programmes
forced on former colonies by the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank. [There was the Belgian Congo holocaust. Or what was
essentially the **[ethnic cleansing of an entire continent]{.mark} in
South America** resulting from Spanish and Portuguese capitalist
expansion during the colonial era.]{.underline}

[Yet when we discuss capitalism we tend not to discuss the violence
associated with it. In terms of death tolls, the **[violence]{.mark} of
colonialism [cannot be over-stated]{.mark}. The slave trade,
[colonialism]{.mark} and neo-colonialism have [contributed to untold
numbers of dead]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Even something such as the [[war]{.mark} in Iraq can be [linked to
capitalism]{.mark} when we look at the embedded nature of arms companies
within the Western state apparatus, as well as the fact that access to
oil [resources]{.mark} was a [motivating factor for
invading]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[**[Capitalism and human rights abuses go together like yin and
yang]{.underline}**.]{.mark} People might detach themselves from concern
about how the chips in their iPhones are made, but in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, [human rights [abuses]{.mark} are [taking
place]{.mark} on a [daily basis]{.mark} [so]{.mark} that [Western firms
can]{.mark} [exploit]{.mark} cobalt [resources]{.mark}.]{.underline}

like a full-time job. The increasing reduction in services such as
crèches and day-nurseries, or the privatisation of others such as
rest-homes for the elderly, have led to a multiplicity of pitfalls for
working women. "Equality at work" has had the negative effect of
introducing more night-work for women. Of course it was right to
establish equal working conditions for women in the security and health
services, and so forth; but what was also at stake with these so-called
egalitarian measures was to allow women to work on the line in
night-shifts, for example. There is absolutely no vital imperative to
build cars at night. The new measures establishing male-female equality
should then have been -- in clear-thinking feminist terms -- to
eliminate night-work for men. Moreover, **[[for most women this
night-work]{.mark} on the line, unacceptable on principle, makes life
intolerably hard most of the time, in view of the work women [still have
to do in the domestic sphere.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The issue of women's work in production, or the public sphere, is
therefore just as central.

**[To manage this issue, [capitalism uses patriarchy as a lever to
attain its objectives]{.mark}, while at the same time [reinforcing
it]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Capitalism is NOT better for women -- unequal pay, housework, and overworking

**Comanne 20** -- \[Denise Comanne was an activist and leader in the
Belgian section of the Fourth International (SAP-LCR) and in the
Belgium-based Committee for the Annulation of the Third World Debt

<https://www.cadtm.org/How-Patriarchy-and-Capitalism-Combine-to-Aggravate-the-Oppression-of-Women>;
accessed: 7/7/22; Lowell-JL\]

**[The fact that women are relegated -- by [patriarchy]{.mark} -- to
domestic tasks [allows capitalists to justify their over-exploitation
and under-payment of women]{.mark} with the argument [that their work is
less productive than men's.]{.mark}]{.underline}** They **[invoke
weakness, menstruation, absenteeism for pregnancy and maternity leave,
breastfeeding, and caring for sick children and older
relatives]{.underline}**. This is where **[the woman's salary is
denigrated as being "for extras"]{.underline}**. Even today, **[[with
equal qualifications]{.mark} and for equal hours, [women are paid about
20% less than men]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This holds a double interest
for capitalists. On the one hand, they have a cheaper, more flexible
labour pool that can be used or laid off according to market
fluctuations; on the other hand, this enables them to bring down rates
of pay generally.

**[The general issue of [women's work in the private and public
spheres]{.mark} thus [reflects]{.mark} either [their oppression]{.mark},
as for example when policies of the far right or religious
fundamentalism force them to remain in the home; or their liberation, as
in the case of progressive policies of equal pay, job creation and free
public services.]{.underline}**

\*\*\*\*\*\*

Having duly noted the importance of domestic work, the feminist current
"class struggle" gives the following analysis \[3\] :

• The oppression of women preceded capitalism but the latter has
profoundly modified it.

**[[Housework]{.mark}, in its true sense, [came into being with
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. By largely replacing small-scale
commercial production in the domains of agriculture and the crafts with
big industry, **[capitalism [made the separation between]{.mark} the
sites of production ([the workplace]{.mark}) [and]{.mark} of
reproduction ([the family]{.mark}) [increasingly distinct]{.mark},
[assigning to women the]{.mark} role of [responsibility for the
home]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[This new ideology of the housewife,
which started in the bourgeoisie, bred disdain for the woman who "had"
to go out to work, not having a husband to support her]{.underline}**.
This ideology was not confined to the bourgeoisie but also spread
through and contaminated the emerging workers' movement. However,
**[contrary to popular belief, women in the lower classes never stopped
working, caught in the web of contradictions linked to their tasks
within the family and their difficult working conditions.]{.underline}**
This is why we feel that **[[the articulation between capitalism and
patriarchal oppression must be analysed as a single
phenomenon]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Capitalism is worse for gender inequalities -- women have to take care of both the workforce and family

**Comanne 20** -- \[Denise Comanne was an activist and leader in the
Belgian section of the Fourth International (SAP-LCR) and in the
Belgium-based Committee for the Annulation of the Third World Debt
(CADTM); 5/28/20; "How Patriarchy and Capitalism Combine to Aggravate
the Oppression of Women";
<https://www.cadtm.org/How-Patriarchy-and-Capitalism-Combine-to-Aggravate-the-Oppression-of-Women>;
accessed: 7/7/22; Lowell-JL\]

**[[Capitalism]{.mark} is a dynamic and aggressive mode of production
which as such, [penetrates all social relations]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
For example, **[[capitalism did not hesitate to]{.mark} make mass calls
for very [cheap female and child labour]{.mark} in the early 19th
century]{.underline}**, in order to increase production and thus
profits. Throughout the centuries, **[[this quest for maximum profits
has led capitalism to undermine]{.mark} (at least partially) [paternal
and marital authority]{.mark}]{.underline}**, making working women
"free" to sell their labour without their husband's permission and to
become fully-fledged consumers.

This call for women's labour underwent new developments in the early
'Sixties and again in the present day on a global scale. With the
delocalisation of traditional or cutting-edge industries, in North
Africa, Latin America or Asia, employers, in search of new profits,
recruit young women into the labour market. These young, exploited,
working women have nevertheless been able to acquire a certain financial
independence from the men of the family, leading them to demand freedom
in many domains.

At the same time, in the developed capitalist countries, more and more
of the activities previously kept within the family are externalized,
taken care of in the first instance by public services such as schools
and health institutions, or increasingly dealt with through the market:
the making of clothes, meals, and so on.

• **[[The oppression of women is useful to the capitalist
system]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Capitalism, while favouring a certain emancipation of women for the sake
of profit, nevertheless remains very attached to the traditional family
institution. Why?

\- In our societies, the family plays a fundamental role in reproducing
the divisions, as well as the hierarchy, between the different social
classes and genders to which different social and economic functions are
assigned. **[In the name of the "maternal" function, [women must take on
all the tasks related to]{.mark} maintaining and reproducing [the
workforce and the family]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As for men, they are
always supposed to be the main economic purveyors. **[All this [makes it
possible]{.mark}, in the context of professional segregation and in the
name of the so-called complementary roles, [to carry on underpaying
women on a discriminatory basis]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

\- Family also plays its part in "regulating" the labour market. In
times of economic expansion, as was the case for about thirty years
until the early 1970s, women are massively called upon as cheap labour
in a number of manufacturing industries such as electronics, then as
wage-earners in the service industry. But in times of economic
recession, as over the last thirty years, **[[employers]{.mark} and the
State unrelentingly [suggest that women should]{.mark} -- partly or
completely -- [withdraw from the labour market to devote themselves to
their "natural" vocation as mothers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When there
are signs of economic recovery (however short-lived), some collective
investments are again considered, not with regard to gender equality,
but in order to "release" female labour and subject it to flexible
schedules.

#### It is impossible to achieve the liberation of women under a capitalist system

**Comanne 20** -- \[Denise Comanne was an activist and leader in the
Belgian section of the Fourth International (SAP-LCR) and in the
Belgium-based Committee for the Annulation of the Third World Debt
(CADTM); 5/28/20; "How Patriarchy and Capitalism Combine to Aggravate
the Oppression of Women";
<https://www.cadtm.org/How-Patriarchy-and-Capitalism-Combine-to-Aggravate-the-Oppression-of-Women>;
accessed: 7/7/22; Lowell-JL\]

Therefore, contrary to what some feminists seem to believe, **[[it is
difficult to imagine how the liberation of women]{.mark} (of all women,
not just of a tiny minority), [could be achieved in a capitalist
system]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is why we deem it necessary,
whatever the conflicts involved, to bring together the struggle of women
against patriarchal oppression and the struggle of wage-earners against
capitalist exploitation. As an illustration of how difficult such
convergence can be: some male trade unionists do not think it "proper"
that women should be factory workers or are not ready to join a women's
struggle, arguing that it is through the "global" (i.e. men's) struggle
that women stand to make benefits. Moreover, some men still enjoy
"ruling the roost" at home.

More is the pity that such irrational and obviously abstruse debate
should so occupy us at a time of great global turmoil. That it does and
continues to do so reflect our lack of judicious criteria for evaluating
theory and, more importantly, the lack of attachment theorists have to
the real world. Certainly, it is right and proper that we ponder the
depths of our theoretical imaginations, engage in
**[[epistemological]{.mark} and ontological
[debate]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and analyze the sociology of our
knowledge. But **[to support]{.underline}** that **[this is the only
task of international theory]{.underline}**, let alone the most
important one, **[[smacks of]{.mark} intellectual [elitism and

On all these questions one must answer **[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
This is not to say, of course, that all theory should be judged by its

argues. But **[[to support that problem-solving]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**Lipshutz, 2011**- Prof of Politics at UC Santa Cruz, speaking after
hearing a policy debate in which the affirmative read a straight up
policy aff and the negative read a security criticism (Ronnie, Speaking
about the final round at the California Round Robin, Feb 18, Accessed
here: <http://nfltv.org/2011/02/24/cal-round-robin-policy/> JC)

RONNIE LIPSCHUTZ: Well, many many years ago, one day when I was reading
the San Francisco chronicle I clipped a little phrase. I've never been
able to find it, but it was something like, one of the emperor Fredrichs
said [the surest way to ruin your country is to put it under the charge
of college professors]{.underline}. I have to say [that I am now fully
convinced of the truth of that statement]{.underline}. But since I have
been charged here with taking on the philosophical side of things, I
wanna make a few point about in particular the negative arguments but
also I think about the the affirmative. I'm not a debater by the way, so
I don't quite understand what's been going on. But what I think in
particular is a problem is, first of all, [we have]{.underline} sort of
[incommensurate conceptual sort of categories going on here that the
affirmative is taking a farther narrow policy question and proposing a
change to it. [The negative]{.mark} then [raises]{.mark} these
[questions of epistemology]{.mark} and ontology which]{.underline} in a
way **[[are not]{.underline}]{.mark}** obvious **[[confronting the
policy question which]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and I agree with Erin,
**[[is]{.mark} very very [narrowly construed]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I
mean, there was no sort of question about, well, let me put it this way:
that although there was a discussion of the virtues of the alliance with
Japan, It was largely taken as a given and therefore of course that
causes a problem, and **[by taking [this]{.mark} sort of
[epistemological]{.mark} and ontological
[approach]{.mark}]{.underline}**, its sort of, **[[its ships passing in
the night]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And then of course the theory question
came up, and that I thought was problematic for both sides. A couple of
things I wanna say. The first one is that, **[social constructions can
kill.]{.underline}** And I think this is a very important sort of thing
to remember that[, **[threats can be]{.mark}** socially **[constructed
but threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}, social constructions [**[have
material components]{.mark}**, and they are aimed in particular
directions.]{.underline} So [the fact that something is **[a social
construction]{.mark}**]{.underline} or is epistemologically and
ontologically questionable [**[does not mean]{.mark}** that there
**[aren't missiles being deployed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and that those
missiles are not going to go off[. [These arguments
are]{.mark}]{.underline} I think [[operating at a]{.mark} somewhat
[different space]{.mark}, it does raise a question of how is it that we
judge what is a threat in the first place.]{.underline} And of course we
have nuclear friends and nuclear enemies. You ought to ask the question,
"Why is it that Great Britain has nuclear weapons and yet there is
nobody, as far as I know, that is planning a war with Great Britain?".
Now I could be wrong about this, since the Pentagon probably has plenty
of analysts who have nothing to do ERIN SIMPSON: They make power points
LIPSHUTZ: Yeah, they make power points. So that, then, of course raises
some of these epistemological questions. Which I think if you want to
somehow deploy the stuff that it seems like, sadly, I have said
somewhere that it is important to sort of take that much more carefully
into account. The other thing that I am sort of struck by is that I've
become in recent, in the last year ago a great fan of Pierre Bourdieu.
[All of these guys, all of my friends that you were citing]{.underline},
although I don't consider Mearshimer a friend, [as I listen to this I
think]{.underline}, what, you know, [what patent nonsense it is that
they are]{.underline} basically [spouting]{.underline}. But **[this is
the way that the academic realm goes]{.underline}**, you know. I mean
[its attack and counter-attack.]{.underline} And I think [you have to be
very careful again in interrogating]{.underline}, so If you've got to be
critical, [you should be very critical of those who are
critical,]{.underline} you know, [to ask what is the politics behind the
critique.]{.underline} Because **[there are politics in all of
this.]{.underline}** [Not just politics in the policy,]{.underline}
okay, [and interests and all kinds of deeply imbedded
commitments]{.underline}, which are impossible to change. If you watch
congress in action right now, you can see that. But also that there is a
kind of, I mean its, **[academics is more by other means]{.underline}**,
I guess, to take a leaf from both Clausewitz and Foucault. Anyway, to go
back to Bourdieu. [Bourdieu]{.underline}, who's a sociologist who died
several years ago, [has a]{.underline} sort of very [interesting
approach to some of these things]{.underline} which is [oriented around
practice. You]{.underline} know, [what are the practices that groups,
societies, engage in, and how do we understand those practices
reinforcing normative beliefs and policies and approaches]{.underline}.
Okay, and **[If you really are interested in how do things change, you
have to look at how practices change rather than intellectual arguments
on the one hand or arming to the teeth on the other.]{.underline}** So
perhaps I would encourage, you know, if you are to go on with debate,
you should probably take a look at Bourdieu. I'm done.

### 2ac- AT: Ontology First

#### Extinction outweighs ontology.

**Michelis, 17**---University of Turin (Angela, "The roots of human
responsibility," Rev. Filos., Aurora, Curitiba, v. 29, n. 46, p.
307-333, jan./abr. 2017, dml)

The common elements making both phenomena paradigmatic and original are
retraceable, according to Jonas, through the concepts of "totality",
"continuity" and "future" in relation to the existence and happiness of
human beings. **[Human beings, like all other living [beings, are ends
in themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}**; however, **[only [human]{.mark}
being[s are able to]{.mark} carry out strategies which [safeguard
their]{.mark} being [ends]{.mark} in themselves]{.underline}**.
Therefore, **[their very capacity for [action implies]{.mark} an
objective [obligation]{.mark} in the form of external
responsibility]{.underline}**. For these reasons they can be defined as
moral beings; that is, as capable of carrying out morally responsible or
morally irresponsible behaviours33. Jonas reaffirms in any case that the
archetype of every responsibility is that of human beings for human
beings, in which the subject-object connection in **[the relationship of
responsibility is irrefutable, and through this the responsibility for
every living thing becomes clear.]{.underline}**

The totality of responsibility may be characterized by the paradigmatic
examples of parents and of the statesman, which combine as the opposite
poles of the greatest particularity and the greatest generality. In
particular, **the educational sphere demonstrates** how **the
responsibility** of parents and **of the State** are related, and how
the private and public spheres **integrate reciprocally, encompassing
all aspects of the life of human beings**. As Jonas describes,

the education of the child includes socialization, beginning with speech
and progressing with the transmission of the entire code of societal
convictions and norms, through whose appropriation the individual
becomes a member of the wider community. The private opens itself
essentially to the public and includes it in its own completeness as
belonging to the being of the person. In other words, the 'citizen' is
an immanent aim of education, thus a part of parental responsibility,
and this not only by force of the state's enjoining it. From the other
side, just as the parents educate their children 'for the state' (if for
much more as well), so does the state assume responsibility for the
education of the young. The earliest phase is left in most societies to
the home, but everything after that comes under the supervision,
regulation, and aid of the state -- so that one can speak of a public
'educational policy'.34

The continuity of responsibility depends on its own very nature since,
for example, neither the care of parents nor the care of the government
can cease, as they must respond to the ever new needs of life, which is
rooted in the past and moves towards the future. Of course, political
responsibility is greater in both temporal directions in relation to the
greater duration of the historical community with respect to individual
existence.

**[Responsibility is projected beyond the present and today's care into
the future, despite life's unpredictability]{.underline}**; therefore,
**[responsibility must have the function of making possible more than
determining the present]{.underline}**. Jonas writes:

The object's self-owned futurity is the truest futural aspect of the
responsibility, which thus makes itself the guardian of the very source
of that irksome unpredictability in the fruits of its labors. Its
highest fulfillment, which it must be able to dare, is its abdication
before the right of the never anticipated, which emerges as the outcome
of its care \[...\] In the light of such self-transcending width, it
becomes apparent that responsibility as such is nothing else but the
moral complement to the ontological constitution of our temporality35.

Thus, **[every total responsibility]{.underline}**, such as that of a
parent or that of statesman or stateswoman -- **[beyond its specific and
important duties]{.underline}** -- **[is always also the preservation of
the future possibility of responsible actions and of politics
itself]{.underline}**.

Jonas affirms that by means of the difficult journey through the various
regions of responsibility, he also found the answer to the question that
at the beginning seemed to represent "the critical point of moral
theory": how to transform the will into the "ought".

The transition is mediated by the phenomenon of power in its uniquely
human sense, in which causal force joins with knowledge and freedom.
\[\...\] Only in man is power emancipated from the whole through
knowledge and arbitrary will and only in man can it become fatal to him
and to itself, his capacity is his fate, and it increasingly becomes the
general fate. In him, therefore, and in him alone, there arises out of
the willing itself the 'ought' as the self-control of his consciously
exercised power36.

**[Human beings, as an epiphenomenon of nature capable of determining
for itself the aims of actions and to carry them out autonomously, have
reached]{.underline}** even within nature **[the point at which their
own [self-destruction is possible]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[This
imposes]{.mark} upon them [the duty]{.mark} to pay special attention [to
not destroy]{.mark}ing]{.underline}**, through irresponsible use,
**[what exists, what has come about, and [all]{.mark} the other [living
things]{.mark}, which are somehow in their power]{.underline}**.
Therefore, **[it is clear that, at the present time, [human
power]{.mark} not only requires the union of will and obligation, but
also undeniably [places responsibility at the centre of
morality]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[Ethics and politics are necessarily interwoven, and]{.underline}**
Hans Jonas -- **[in a situation where survival is
threatened]{.underline}**, of emergency, owing to the exponential
development of technological power, and in the conviction that human
beings cannot adapt themselves to everything -- declares: "For the
moment, **[all work on the 'true' \[hu\]man must stand back behind the
bare saving of its [precondition]{.mark}]{.underline}**, namely, **[[the
existence of \[hu\]mankind]{.mark} in a sufficient natural
environment]{.underline}**"37.

**[[Responsible politics]{.mark} turns towards the future with the
consciousness that it [must guarantee]{.mark} the very possibility of
responsible action and the existence of [future generations]{.mark}, [as
well as the right to life]{.mark} of the world]{.underline}**. It urges
a limitation of technological development and the pursuit of a moderate
and equitable use of resources.

However, in the same book **[[Diamond offers]{.underline}]{.mark}** some
**[glimmers of [hope]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[In]{.mark} the US state
of [Montana]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[despite]{.underline}** **[the
fact that mining companies were forced to retreat and that both
agriculture and livestock have decreased]{.underline}** due to land
being repurposed **[for]{.underline}** recreational activities for
**[wealthy people]{.underline}** who do not reside in the state, the
important point is that **[[environmental protection]{.mark} now [takes
precedence over]{.mark} [mining]{.mark}, [agricultural]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [industrial]{.mark} [activities]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[Furthermore]{.underline}**, in a notable example of 'social
responsibility', the transnational company
**[[StillwaterMining]{.mark},]{.underline}** owner of a platinum and
palladium mine, **[came to an [understanding]{.mark} with
[environmental]{.mark} groups]{.underline}** (including a trout
protection NGO named Trout Unlimited), **[and]{.underline}** also
**[[reached agreements]{.underline}]{.mark}** with the local community
**[[regarding]{.mark} [employment, education, electricity and citizen
services]{.mark}]{.underline}** in exchange for ecologists and citizens
not opposing the operations of the mining company. **[A similar scenario
occurred when]{.underline}** the transnational corporation BP
(**[[British Petroleum]{.underline}]{.mark}**) bought a large copper
mine formerly owned by Anaconda, and **[[rejected]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** previous mine-owner's **[[traditional policies of
refusing to clean up]{.mark} pollution,
[financing]{.mark}]{.underline}** local **[support [groups favourable to
it]{.mark}s interests]{.underline}**, declaring bankruptcy and other
similar measures. **[Instead, BP made a commitment]{.underline}** to
carry out clean-up work **[without shirking its
responsibilities]{.underline}** towards the environment.

In other meaningful cases, which are significant because they involve
transnational corporations, **[[Diamond]{.mark} cites the policies of
companies such as the Chevron oil company in Papua New Guinea in the
Kutubu oilfield]{.underline}** that functions as a de facto national
park. **[He [further cites]{.mark} [Chevron's understanding]{.mark} with

Products, the famous **[[IKEA]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Sweden, **[[B &
K]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Great Britain,
**[[Anderson]{.underline}]{.mark}** Corporation, Collins Pine, Lowe's,
Svea Skog and **[many others belong.]{.underline}**
**[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}** eco-labelling experiment (based on
certificates) **[has [also]{.mark} been [adopted by]{.mark} the
[fishing]{.mark}]{.underline}** industry under a similar name, the
Marine Stewardship Council ([MSC)]{.mark}, in which a range of companies
from the World Wildlife Fund to companies such as Unilever, Marks &
Spencer, Safeway, Young's Bluecrest Seafood Co., Sainsbury's, Safeway,
Whole Foods, Migros, France Foods and several others are included.
**[This is all based on the idea that [while]{.mark} a [company can
maximize its benefits]{.mark} in the short term, [it is in]{.mark} its
[long-term interest to adopt]{.mark} corporate [social

[causing]{.mark} [harm]{.mark} to the environment and the population,
[and]{.mark} to [ensure]{.mark} the adequate [conservation]{.mark} of
the forests and the fishing resources that provide them with their
economic activity, but also to project a responsible image for the
purposes of their commercial relations throughout the
world.]{.underline}**

Alongside the protection and forest conservation policies of the
Scandinavian and European countries in general, among which Germany
stands out, and also the conservationist policies that were put in place
in countries such as Japan (since the Tokugawa dynasty in the sixteenth
century),25 some developing countries should also be highlighted.
**[[The]{.mark} [Dominican Republic is]{.mark} a particularly [good
example]{.mark} of a country which has embraced sustainable forest
development.]{.underline}** A third of its territory has been declared
protected areas and there are seventy-four national parks. This occurred
as a result of the happy coincidence between the interests of
environmental groups and personalities and the support they received
from Joaquín Balaguer, a dominant figure in Dominican history during the
last four decades of the twentieth century. In contrast, unipersonal
dictatorships, structural violence, and the disastrous policy of forest
depredation in Haiti, the country with which the Dominican Republic
shares the island, led the Haitians into a situation of conflict and
violence that forced the United Nations to intervene in order to avoid
the total collapse of the society and its State.

#### Capitalism is positively changing now - any change risks yanking the steering wheel in the wrong direction

[[In recent years, various ideas and proposals have emerged that aim to
rewrite capitalism\'s social contract.]{.mark}]{.underline} What they
have in common is the idea that [businesses need more varied measures of
success than simply profit and growth.]{.underline} In business,
[there\'s \"[conscious
capitalism](https://www.consciouscapitalism.org/)\", inspired by the
practices of so-called \"ethical\" brands.]{.underline} In policy,
there\'s [\"[inclusive
capitalism](https://www.inclusivecapitalism.com/)\",]{.underline}
advocated by both the [Bank of
England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2014/inclusive-capitalism-creating-a-sense-of-the-systemic)
and The Vatican, which advocates harnessing \"capitalism for good\".
[And in sustainability, there\'s the idea of \"[doughnut
economics](https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/)\"]{.underline}, a
theory proposed by economist and author Kate Raworth, which suggests
that [[it\'s possible to thrive economically as a
society](https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p08hppxt/how-the-dutch-are-reshaping-their-post-pandemic-utopia)
while also staying within social and planetary boundaries.]{.underline}
Then there\'s the [\"[Five
Capitals](https://www.forumforthefuture.org/the-five-capitals)\" model
articulated by Jonathan Porritt, the author of Capitalism "As If The
World Matters"]{.underline}. Porritt calls for the [[integration of five
pillars of human capital -- natural, human, social, manufactured, and
financial capital]{.underline}]{.mark} -- into existing economic models.
One tangible example of where companies are beginning to embrace the
Five Capitals is the [B-Corporation
movement](https://bcorporation.net/). Certified companies sign up to a
legal obligation to consider \"the impact of their decisions on their
workers, customers, suppliers, community, and the environment\". Their
ranks now include major corporations such as Danone, Patagonia, and Ben
& Jerry\'s (which is owned by Unilever). [This approach has become
increasingly mainstream, reflected in a 2019 statement released by over
180 corporate CEOs redefining \"[the purpose of a
corporation](https://opportunity.businessroundtable.org/ourcommitment/)\".]{.underline}
For the first time[, [CEOs representing Wal-Mart, Apple, JP Morgan
Chase, Pepsi, and others acknowledged that they must redefine the role
of business in relation to society and the environment.
]{.mark}]{.underline}T[[heir statement proposes that companies must do
more than deliver profits to their shareholders]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
addition[, they must invest in their employees and contribute to the
improvement of the human, natural and social elements of capital that
Porritt refers to in his model, rather than the sole focus on financial
capital.]{.underline} In a recent interview with Yahoo Finance on the
future of capitalism, the executive chairman of Best Buy, Hubert Joly,
said that [\"what has happened is that for 30 years, from the 1980s to
10 years ago, we've had this singular focus on profits that has been
excessive and has caused a lot of these issues. We need to unwind a bit
of these 30 years. If we have a refoundation of business, [it can be a
refoundation of capitalism]{.mark} as well\... I think this can be done,
this has to be done."]{.underline} A new direction. More than three
decades ago, the [United Nations Brundtland Commission wrote in \"[Our
Common Future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Common_Future)\" that
there was ample evidence that social and environmental impacts are
relevant and need to be incorporated into development
models.]{.underline} It is now obvious that these issues must also be
considered within the social contract underpinning capitalism, so that
it is more inclusive, holistic and integrated with basic human values.
[Ultimately, it is worth remembering that [citizens in a capitalist,
liberal democracy are not powerless]{.mark}. Collectively, [they
can]{.mark} support companies aligned with their beliefs, and
continuously demand new laws and policies which [transform the
competitive landscape of corporations so that they might improve their
practices]{.mark}]{.underline}. When [Adam Smith]{.underline} was
observing nascent industrial capitalism in 1776, he [could not foresee
just how much it would transform our societies today]{.underline}. So it
follows that we might be similarly blind to what capitalism could look
like in another two centuries. However, that does not mean we should not
ask how it might evolve into something better in the nearer term. [The
future of capitalism and our planet depend on it.]{.underline}

#### Greed as a motive is a lie 

**Bhalla**, 20**21** (Bag, author. "Biotechnology greed is prolonging
the pandemic. It's inexcusable." ASBMB. Oct. 30, 2021.
[https://www.asbmb.org/asbmb-today/opinions/103021/biotechnology-greed-is-prolonging-the-pandemic-it
///](https://www.asbmb.org/asbmb-today/opinions/103021/biotechnology-greed-is-prolonging-the-pandemic-it%20///)MF)

Did greed just save the day? That's what British Prime Minister Boris
Johnson claimed recently. "The reason we have the vaccine success," he
said in a private call to Conservative members of Parliament, "is
because of capitalism, [because of
greed.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/mar/23/greed-and-capitalism-behind-jab-success-boris-johnson-tells-mps)"

Despite later backpedaling, Johnson's remark reflects a widely
influential but wildly incoherent view of innovation: that greed --- the
unfettered pursuit of profit above all else --- is a necessary driver of
technological progress. Call it the need-greed theory.

Among the pandemic's many lessons, however, is that greed can easily
work against the common good. We rightly celebrate the near-miraculous
development of effective vaccines, which have been widely deployed in
rich nations. But the global picture reveals not even a semblance of
justice: As of May, low-income nations received [just 0.3
percent](https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/more-million-covid-deaths-4-months-g7-leaders-failed-break-vaccine-monopolies) of
the global vaccine supply. At this rate it would take 57 years for them
to achieve full vaccination.

This disparity has been dubbed "[vaccine
apartheid](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/g7-must-finance-global-covid19-vaccination-drive-by-gordon-brown-2021-06),"
and it's exacerbated by greed. A year after the launch of the World
Health Organization's Covid-19 Technology Access Pool --- a program
aimed at encouraging the collaborative exchange of intellectual
property, knowledge, and data --- "not a single company has [donated its
technical
knowhow](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/17/covid-vaccine-nationalism-internationalist-approach),"
wrote politicians from India, Kenya, and Bolivia in a June essay for The
Guardian. As of that month, the U.N.-backed COVAX initiative, a vaccine
sharing scheme established to provide developing countries equitable
access, had delivered only about 90 million out of a promised 2 billion
doses. Currently, pharmaceutical companies, lobbyists, and conservative
lawmakers continue to oppose proposals for [patent
waivers](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/29/explainer-what-are-covid-vaccine-patent-waivers) that
would allow local drug makers to manufacture the vaccines without [legal
jeopardy](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/05/05/993998745/biden-backs-waiving-international-patent-protections-for-covid-19-vaccines).
[They claim the [waivers would [slow down existing
production](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2021/05/07/patent-waivers-wont-impact-big-pharmas-bottom-line-but-could-slow-covid-vaccine-rollouts/?sh=7dc29a6c7862)]{.mark},
"[foster the proliferation of counterfeit
vaccines](https://www.phrma.org/Press-Release/PhRMA-Statement-on-WTO-TRIPS-Intellectual-Property-Waiver),"
and, as North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr said, "undermine the
very [innovation we are
relying](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/05/05/biden-waives-vaccine-patents/) on
to bring this pandemic to an end."]{.underline}

[[All these views echo the idea that patents and high drug prices are
necessary motivators for biomedical innovation. But examine that logic
closely, and it quickly begins to fall apart.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[A [great deal of difficult, innovative work is done in industries and
fields that lack patents.]{.mark} Has the lack of patent protections for
recipes led to any dearth of innovation in restaurants? An irritating
irony here is that economists who espouse the need-greed theory
themselves innovate for comparative peanuts. For instance, in 2018, the
median compensation for economists was
about [\$104,000](https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/students/careers/earnings).
The typical pharmaceutical CEO, meanwhile, earned a whopping [\$5.7
million](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biotech-pharma-ceo-employee-pay/554283/) in
total compensation that year. (The hands-on innovators aren't the
need-greeders here; the median compensation for pharmaceutical employees
--- including benefits --- was about \$177,000 in 2018.) [Even in
Silicon Valley, writes ever-astute technology insider Tim O'Reilly,
\"the notion that entrepreneurs will stop innovating if they aren't
rewarded with billions is a [pernicious
fantasy](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/two-economies-two-sets-of-rules/).\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[To be sure, it was not greed but rather a vast collaborative effort
--- funded largely with public dollars --- that generated effective
coronavirus vaccines.]{.mark} The technology behind mRNA vaccines such
as those produced by Pfizer and Moderna took decades of work by
University of Pennsylvania scientists you've likely never heard of.
According to The New York Times, one of those scientists, Katalin
Kariko, "[never made more than \$60,000 a
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/health/coronavirus-mrna-kariko.html)"
while doing her innovative foundational research. The researchers at
Oxford University who developed the technology behind AstraZeneca's
vaccine, which was mostly publicly funded, initially set out with the
intention of "[non-exclusive,
royalty-free](https://innovation.ox.ac.uk/technologies-available/technology-licensing/expedited-access-covid-19-related-ip/)"
licensing for their vaccine. Only after pressure to work with a
multinational pharmaceutical company from the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, among others, did
they [renege](https://khn.org/news/rather-than-give-away-its-covid-vaccine-oxford-makes-a-deal-with-drugmaker/) and
license the technology solely to AstraZeneca.]{.underline}

[It was astonishing, then, when Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca's CEO, said
that intellectual property, or IP, "is a fundamental part of our
industry and if you don\'t protect IP, then essentially there is no
incentive for anybody to innovate." The Oxford scientists whose work
AstraZeneca licensed literally just innovated without the incentives
Soriot claimed are essential. Why do journalists present need-greeder
claims, [such as
Soriot's](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/patent-pool-potential-covid-19-products-nonsense-pharma-leaders/),
without holding the specific role of profit seeking to
account?]{.underline}

[It'[s no secret that innovators (and people generally) often aren't
necessarily greed-driven]{.mark}. For instance, as Walter Isaacson notes
in his book about superstar biochemist Jennifer Doudna\'s work on Crispr
gene manipulation technology, she was never motivated primarily by
money. In fact, he reports that corporate maneuvering over her work made
her \"physically ill.\" Countless cases like hers show that [innovations
in science and technology typically aren't the result of genius
lightning strikes but rather of field-wide efforts with multiple teams
circling the same goal. If anyone withdraws for lack of greed-gratifying
incentives, no problem: They're welcome to write themselves out of
history. Others will gladly grasp the glory. And we, the public, lose
nothing.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Perhaps Soriot meant, more generally, that reduced revenues would cut
AstraZeneca's overall research and development (R&D) spending. But even
that claim is detectably dubious. When drug makers claim that high
prices are essential for innovation, they are "[flat out
lying](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/12/financialization-of-the-u-s-pharmaceutical-industry.html)"
financial expert Yves Smith wrote in 2019. Smith cited data published
with the Institute for New Economic Thinking showing that, between 2009
and 2018, 18 drug makers listed in the S&P 500 spent 14 percent more on
stock buybacks and dividends than they did on R&D. These companies could
easily ramp up investments in innovative drugs, the authors wrote,
simply by reining in distributions to shareholders. (Don't forget that
share buybacks were effectively classified as [illegal market
manipulation](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/2/17639762/stock-buybacks-tax-cuts-trump-republicanssi) until
the Securities and Exchange Commission, under Reagan, relaxed the rules
in 1982.)]{.underline}

Of the money that drug companies do invest in R&D, a significant amount
for many goes not toward innovative research but to "finding ways to
suppress generic and biosimilar competition while continuing to raise
prices," according to a [recent
report](https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/COR%20Staff%20Report%20-%20Pharmaceutical%20Industry%20Buybacks%20Dividends%20Compared%20to%20Research.pdf) from
the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform. In these cases,
executive and investor greed demonstrably impede innovation. A
recent [Congressional
hearing](https://twitter.com/RepKatiePorter/status/1394724627566391297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1394724627566391297%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fhouse%2F554329-katie-porter-brings-her-whiteboard-) dramatized
this issue when Rep. Katie Porter, a California Democrat, grilled the
CEO of AbbVie, a biopharmaceutical company which she said spent \$2.45
billion on research and development, \$4.71 billion a year on marketing
and advertising, and [\$50 billion on shareholder
payouts](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/554329-katie-porter-brings-her-whiteboard-to-accuse-pharma-ceo-of-inflating-drug) between
2013 and 2018. She characterized the idea that R&D justified
astronomical prices as "the Big Pharma fairy tale."

Even if greed makes sense for some for-profit ventures, it would be
unwise for us to rely only on for-profit enterprise to harness
innovation for social goals. There are many things that we must do
whether they are profitable or not, and the horrific fiasco over vaccine
patents has shown us that biotech executives and other members of the
"thinkerati" are not above putting profits ahead of saving lives. As
White House adviser Anthony Fauci noted to [the
Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/551971-fauci-covid-19-vaccine-patent-waiver-should-not-be-off-the-table) earlier
this year, America has a \"moral obligation" to "make sure that the rest
of the world does not suffer and die" from something that we can help to
prevent. Our government is failing in its duty to act in the public
interest if it allows "your money or your life" to pass as an acceptable
business model.

As an open letter signed by more than a hundred intellectual property
scholars [recently
stated](https://research.kent.ac.uk/socril/ip-scholarship-trips-waiver/),
IP rights (which includes patents) "are not, and have never been,
absolute rights and are granted and recognized under the condition that
they serve the public interest." The scholars noted precedents like last
year's use of the Defense Production Act to increase production of
medical supplies, and the U.S.'s commandeering of penicillin production
during World War II. If Covid-19 vaccine makers refuse to make
life-saving technology publicly available, governments should enact
mandatory licensing or similar measures.

There are also compelling reasons to develop a standing, publicly
operated rapid-response vaccine manufacturing capability. Pfizer's CFO
suggested that prices on vaccines will go up once we are out of the
"[pandemic-pricing
environment](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/pfizer-eyes-higher-covid-19-vaccine-prices-after-pandemic-exec-analyst),"
noting that the company can charge nearly nine times more than they have
been ("\$150, \$175 per dose," the CFO said, versus the \$19.50 Pfizer
is charging the U.S. in one supply deal). Even if those who haven't
received a single dose of the vaccine never do, that could mean roughly
a \$30 billion bonanza from U.S. booster shots alone. Patient advocates
estimate that it would cost [just \$4
billion](https://theweek.com/articles/981550/how-joe-biden-could-vaccinate-world) for
the U.S. to set up a public-private operation capable of manufacturing
enough mRNA vaccines to immunize the whole planet, with each shot
costing \$2. This would be a great way for America to show global
leadership, and would surely be way cheaper, both individually and
collectively, than being annually "Pfizered." Plus, the usefulness of
such a facility would long outlast the current pandemic, with climate
change making zoonotic spillover events more likely (not to mention the
risks of weaponized viruses). Covid-19 was our "[starter
pandemic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/10/coronavirus-election/616884/),"
as Ed Yong usefully dubbed it.

If greed-driven companies fail to exercise their powers responsibly,
they should face competition from the public sector. President Biden let
the cat out of the bag when [he
said](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/07/09/remarks-by-president-biden-at-signing-of-an-executive-order-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/) that
"capitalism without competition isn\'t capitalism; it\'s exploitation."
While many people applauded his sentiment, stop and think about the
implication: The president was, in essence, saying that
we expect corporations to exploit us if given half a chance.

We pay a huge price in blood and treasure when we give the need-greeders
free rein to lie to and exploit the public with impunity. We must be
clear-eyed about exactly when greed can help our collective interests
and when it hinders them. During a crisis as dire as a global pandemic,
greed won't save us.

**[[The debate we should be having is about what a free-market
capitalist society looks like when it is struggling]{.mark} with certain
inequities and injustices [and trying to remedy those
problems]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Reeves: I want to underline what Ryan said: **[[Confidence in capitalism
is really the issue]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but it is a difficult
problem. **[The psychological scars of the recession and sense of
disappointment are greater than perhaps the economic loss. [The real
enemy of capitalism is not socialism; it is
pessimism.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[If you start to lose the sense that the future is going to be better
largely as a result of your own effort and investment,]{.mark} then you
don't do the things to make it better]{.underline}**. You don't invest
in your education, you don't move, and you don't risk starting a
business. **[[You become more fatalistic and pessimistic]{.mark}. That
is really what we are talking about here.]{.underline}**

I also want to underscore Ryan's point about the growing geographical
inequality. We used to have a more centrifugal capitalism. The
opportunity to expand was quite well dispersed spatially because you
moved to where it was cheaper to do business.

Today, we are seeing the opposite, a centripetal capitalism. **[More
power is being concentrated in specific companies and areas. That's why
you get this sense of people who are being left behind. Instead of
thinking about the distributional aspects of capitalism across income,
the more important distributions today are across firms and
communities.]{.underline}**

Are the lives of young adults all that different from what went before?
High student debt and high housing prices are two objective
measurements. But what is different about the world that is shaping
these attitudes in new ways?

Streeter: First, I do think some of the reporting about the pessimism
among young adults about America's future is a bit exaggerated. In our
survey research, young adults --- Millennials, Gen Xers, and Gen Zers
--- are a little more bullish on whether or not they are going to
achieve the American Dream, however they define it, than has been
recorded.

Having said that, **[[people entering the workforce after the Great
Recession suffered a collective psychological
trauma]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[That has [reduced]{.mark} [confidence
in institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}** that typically support things
like entrepreneurship and playing by the rules and working hard so you
will have a better life than your parents. **[[A pervasive timidity
exists.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

As Francesco Boldizzoni has shown, **[the [charges leveled against
capitalism]{.mark} are [as old as capitalism]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}**. Whether the problem is **[[poverty]{.mark} or
excessive affluence, imperialism or delocalization, globalization, war,
[human rights]{.mark} infringement, inner-city poverty, lack of
affordable housing, [climate change]{.mark}, environmental degradation,
loss of morality, long working hours, misogyny, [white
supremacy]{.mark}, or some other wrong]{.underline}**, fingers
inevitably point to **[the usual culprit]{.underline}**. The push for
"unnecessary economic growth" is no exception, as degrowth sympathizers
see behind it the evil juggernaut of capitalism**[. [Blaming]{.mark}
something on an [abstract concept]{.mark}, or on its vaguely identified
supporters ("capitalists") can surely [feel liberating]{.mark}, in the
way that attacking a generic "establishment" does]{.underline}**. It
allows the blame to shift outward, releasing individuals from personal
responsibility. In the words of degrowth guru Jason Hickel, "People are
victims of the system."1

At the same time, **[such an [approach]{.mark} is [highly
unhelpful]{.mark}, because it [prevents engagement in deeper
inquiry]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We saw when we delved into the mechanics
of capitalism in Chapter 2 that, while **[there are some [inbuilt
features such as competition]{.mark} among firms which [feed the growth
imperative]{.mark}, our [economic system could]{.mark} in principle
[be]{.mark} just as [compatible with zero growth]{.mark} if this were
what consumers desired]{.underline}**. Along similar lines, we saw in
Chapter 3 how ecosocialism could in principle be made to work if a "less
is more" ideology were embraced at once by the entire population of a
country (or, ideally, all of humanity).

Typically, however, such **[lines of thinking are not developed very far
before the [critics of capitalism throw up]{.mark} their [hands in
helpless gestures]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Going back to square one,
**[capitalism is portrayed as the puppet master forcing human beings to
act in ways they would not choose]{.underline}**, for example by
generating "artificial scarcity" to drive levels of consumption they do
not even enjoy. Consumers are presented as behaving contrary to the
wishes of humans, despite these being the same population.2 Even John
Kenneth Galbraith, fine economist that he was, fell back on this
defenseless posture, arguing that people kept consuming more only
because they were victims of advertising. And capitalism has more arrows
than advertising in its quiver. From spurring shoppers with sales
promotions to conjuring up new gift-giving traditions, it has untold
ways to generate unnecessary purchases. Worst of all, perhaps, is that
prime suspect: planned obsolescence.3

#### Cap not root cause 

**Haque**, 20**19** (Umair, British economist and author. "The Three
Causes of the World's Four Big Problems" Eudaimonia and Co. April 22,
2019.
https://eand.co/the-three-causes-of-the-worlds-four-big-problems-e9fe49d89e3d)///MF

It was a perfect spring day. I was trying to get home to Camden Lock
from Oxford Circus, after meeting a few friends for coffee downtown. A
siren's blare cut through the noisy crowds. Soon enough, police had shut
down Regent Street --- and massed protesters, cheering, shouting,
rebelling, thronged London's busiest intersection, shutting it down.

I don't know if you've heard elsewhere, but London's seen protests day
after day now --- of a new kind. Organized by a group called Extinction
Rebellion, the subject of these protests isn't authoritarianism,
fascism, extremism, Wall Street --- it's climate change.

[Extinction
Rebellion](https://www.google.com/search?q=extinction+rebellion&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwipgMi2neThAhWHWhUIHSnhBnoQ_AUICSgA&biw=1324&bih=939&dpr=2) is,
by my reckoning, the world's first significant series of global protests
about climate change. The first one to shut down a major city, to
galvanize a people, to cut through the noise of capitalist mass media
--- and do what protests should do: make some noise.

Thus, if you ask me, these protests matter --- and they matter a very
great deal. Even if I myself am the one inconvenienced by them. What
matters more, after all --- me getting the bus on time, or having a
planet? And yet they matter in a way so deep that I think we scarcely
know it. After all, these days --- as things seem to fall apart by the
day...who has time to process much?

So there we were, watching Extinction Rebellion roll by. And one of my
American friends remarked to me, "it's not a surprise these --- the
first real climate change protests --- are happening in London. They'd
never happen back home." She rolled her eyes. Was she right? I thought
so. It's hardly a surprise that Extinction Rebellion was made in
England. London is still the world's most progressive city --- with
competition, perhaps from Barcelona and Paris --- by a very long way. It
would never happen in America. Americans don't protest like Europeans
do. The Parisians protest, the old joke goes, at the drop of a hat. The
Brits, a little more staid, do it more rarely. But Americans protest the
least and last of all.

Protests like Extinction Rebellion matter intensely, in many ways. You
see, the world this century has four Big Problems --- inequality,
fascism, stagnation, and climate change. So far, the world isn't just
making little progress on all these problems. The grim truth is that
it's making regress. Why is that? Have you ever wondered?

2018 saw the highest emissions, ever. But it also saw the highest
inequality. It saw the hardest stagnation --- middle incomes in Europe
flatlined, in the beleaguered Anglo world, Britain and America, they
fell, and in places like China and India, they failed to keep pace with
the cost of living. And as a result of all that, fascism swept the globe
like wildfire. Sure, we can be polite about it, and call it "Trumpism"
or "Orbanism" or "Bolsonarism." But the future isn't going to care about
how polite we were --- it will just be astounded that while fascism
rose, we were too foolish and weak to even call it that.

So protests like these tell us which countries are taking which of the
Big Four Problems seriously. So far, I have to tell you,
nearly no country is taking any of them seriously. How else would they
continue to mount to epic proportions? Yet Extinction Rebellion, for
example, tells us Britain is beginning to take climate change seriously.

When I say "take the Big Problems seriously", I don't mean it like not
just at the level of drab policy that nobody really cares about except
Ezra Klein and Nate Silver. [That's yesteryear's approach ---
technocracy --- and its failed dismally. [The technocratic approach to
all these problems imagines that we can solve them without any active
involvement from people --- simply engineer them away with enough
wonkery.]{.mark} The result is bizarre schemes like America's
"healthcare marketplace", or a global system of emissions caps that's
just not working fast or well enough. [Technocracy isn't going to fix
the great problems of the 21st century --- in the same way that
technology isn't --- because they can't be solved from the top
down.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Taking the Big Problems seriously means that societies begin a project
of social, cultural, and psychological transformation. That people begin
to change from inside --- as we'd say in Econo-speak, that their
preferences and expectations and risk tolerances begin to shift. People
themselves must begin to say, "the risks of a burned out planet, of an
economy left stagnant by predators, of democracies raped by fascists, of
societies torn apart by inequality --- all these are risks too great to
bear."]{.underline}

It's a good sign, therefore, that Extinction Rebellion shut London down.
I suspect I'm one of many, many Londoners who thinks to themselves,
seeing the buses and tubes shut and bridges shut down --- "Christ, what
a pain. Jesus, what a great and wonderful pain to have to have." I'd bet
far more people are sympathetic --- even if, like me, they're hardly
die-hard activists or protestors. And that, my friends, is the idea of
cultural transformation in a nutshell.

My feeling is that deep transformation is going to be the great
difference between societies that can adapt in the 21st century, and
those that can't. But deep transformation is painful. And some
societies, it seems, just can't manage it. Take America, for example.
We'd never see, as my friend aptly observed, Extinction Rebellion there.
But Americans don't seem to care very much about any of the Big Four.
There are no protests about inequality, fascism, climate change,
stagnation --- except occasionally. There are no Gilet Jaunes shutting
Washington DC down. And who can blame Americans? [[Capitalism has them
in a perfect trap --- working so hard just to make ends meet, they never
have time or energy left to change the system]{.mark}. And yet I can't
help but feel that if in any European country, people were dying without
insulin, protests would shut it down overnight,.]{.underline}

Perhaps you see my point. Some societies are more capable of deep
transformation than others. Take Germany. It couldn't be more different
now than a century ago. It's a true social democracy, where people treat
one another with respect, granting one another basic rights to
healthcare, education, retirement, and so on. [But America's never
really changed --- it was built on capitalism, patriarchy, and supremacy
--- and those things, those cancers, grew to the point that they
debilitated it, then left it a zombie state. And that comparison ---
between America, and everyone else, really --- teaches us a great
lesson, too. In what "deep transformation" really means.]{.underline}

[[If there are]{.mark} four [Big Problems in the 21st century]{.mark}
--- [climate change, inequality, stagnation, and fascism]{.mark} ---
then those four problems [also have]{.mark} three [handmaidens:]{.mark}
capitalism[, supremacy, and patriarchy.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Take the example of climate change. We call it "anthropgenic climate
change", but its more accurate to call it CCCC, or capitalism-caused
climate change --- social democracies are the ones reducing their
emissions, and capitalist countries are the ones unable to. But climate
change wouldn't exist, also, without supremacy --- the idea that some
people are superior to others, which implies, necessarily, that they
must be superior to plants, trees, rivers, and minerals, too --- all
those things are just there for the supreme to exploit, abuse, and
pillage, just like slaves were once. And just as patriarchy was a key
mechanism in the survival of slavery --- you inherited your father's
slaves --- so too climate change wouldn't exist without patriarchy. It's
the values of toxic masculinity, after all --- dominance, control,
power, abusiveness, acquisitiveness, possessiveness --- that leads us to
literally rape the earth, like a female body without a will, without the
ability to consent.

[You could do the same analysis for any of the Four Big Problems ---
t[hey all trace back to the same three root causes.]{.mark} Inequality
is obvious caused by capitalism. But it's also the result of supremacy,
which embeds it in social structures --- which is why black wealth in
America is in fact less today than during the dawn of desegregation. And
it's also the result of patriarchy --- which is how wealth is passed
down and inherited in thoroughly unreasonable ways, now resulting in
neo-dynasties of billionaire families. The [point is that the
world's]{.mark} Four [Big Problems in the 21st century all share the
same three root causes ---]{.mark} capitalism, [supremacy, patriarchy.
They are the bitter fruit of the same twisted tree of violence, greed,
and ruin.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[These three ideologies --- capitalism, supremacy, patriarchy --- aren't
simple things, or new things. [They're the toxic waste of
millennia.]{.mark} The residue of all the mistakes we've ever made as a
species, really. They are the ghosts that still haunt humankind --- the
phantasms of war, greed, plunder, empire, the clowns of folly, the
banshees of hate. The Big Four won't go away without tackling the Deep
Three.]{.underline}

[So when I say that those societies who can make a psychological,
cultural, social transformation are going to be the ones that prosper
this century, I mean it in a precise way. Those societies which can
transcend the old ways of capitalism, supremacy, and patriarchy are
going to rise and rise and rise. They already are, in fact. The happiest
and wealthiest societies in the world --- from Scandinavia to Barcelona
--- are all pioneers in exactly this way: they are much (much) further
the road of deep transformation than others, having done more to
transcend capitalism, supremacy, and patriarchy.]{.underline}

[Conversely, those societies which can't kick the habits of capitalism,
supremacy, and patriarchy, are already going down the
tubes.]{.underline} Witness America, for example. Britain's not far
behind --- which is why it's a refreshing surprise to see Extinction
Rebellion happen in the land of Brexit.

If you need to understand all that in a visceral way, just think of it
like this.

Who can you think of that's the personification of capitalism,
supremacy, and patriarchy? Trump, of course. Do you think Trump cares
about the Four Big Problems of inequality, climate change, stagnation,
and fascism? LOL, of course not. He embodies them. He hopes to profit
off them. Donald Trump is where centuries of capitalism, supremacy, and
patriarchy led squarely to: the most corrupt, idiotic, selfish, abusive,
imbecile...for the most important job in the world.

Do you see the point? The ages of capitalism, supremacy, and patriarchy
are over --- the harder we cling to them, the more regress we will make.
Their die-hard adherents --- like America's bizarre ultraconservatives,
and Britain's imbecilic Brexiteers --- won't let them go. But the rest
of us have work to do. The work of understanding how and why these
ideologies failed, led to dead ends, are badly obsolete, how to leave
them behind. Capitalism, supremacy, and patriarchy don't add up to
freedom, equality, and justice..they just add up to Donald Trump.

So if you remember one thing this year, one thought, [I think it should
be this: centuries of capitalism, supremacy, and patriarchy led us to a
dead end in human progress --- a dystopian hellscape made of inequality,
stagnation, fascism, and climate change. America exemplifies it. To make
progress this century, we are going to have to transcend those old ways,
those old ideologies, those tired, weary, and failed mindsets. You can
sum that thought up this way: C,P,S → predatory, exploitative collapse
--- of ecologies, economies, democracies, societies. C,P,S → collapse of
any system they govern.]{.underline}

We are going to have to win our freedom from those old, failed, dead,
stupid ways, my friends. It won't be an easy fight. Let us then take a
little inspiration from Extinction Rebellion --- and begin in whatever
tiny ways that we can.

As discussed in my previous blog, we often perceive the world to be more
negative than it is as part of a
negativity [bias](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bias). This
bias manifests us to be hyper-vigilant to potential threats because this
helped our ancestors survive. This is why, even stretching back to the
beginning of civilization, it always feels [like it\'s the end of the
world as we know
it.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/tech-happy-life/202008/why-it-feels-the-end-the-world-even-when-its-not)

On its own, our negativity bias is not a bad thing. The way that natural
selection works, it was necessary for a negativity bias to distort the
way in which our ancestors saw the world for them to survive as a
species. As cognitive psychologist Donald Hoffman describes in [The Case
Against Reality: Why Evolution Hid the Truth From Our
Eyes](https://www.amazon.com/Case-Against-Reality-Evolution-Truth/dp/0393254690/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=case+against+reality&qid=1599000664&sr=8-1&pldnSite=1), fitness
beats reality. That is, survival is more important than the truth, so,
through natural selection, perceptual distortions of reality naturally
emerge when it helps the organism survive and reproduce.

Thank goodness our hominid ancestors distorted reality because
otherwise, we wouldn\'t be here! But as we look back at history and see
the problems of war, genocides, religious persecution, slavery,
misogyny, oppression, and so on, it has often been a rough road indeed!
[[While we have made much progress over time, many of these same
problems persist to this day. Ironically, part of our suffering that we
have experienced and continue to experience is a by-product of the
evolution that got us here in the first place]{.mark}. How is this
so?]{.underline}

Explanatory Power of Evolutionary Mismatch

Our highly evolved brains have helped us to master fire, invent the
wheel, and to develop language, writing, agriculture, intricate social
structures, monetary and political systems, vaccines, plumbing,
computers, smartphones, blogging for Psychology Today, and so on. Yet,
herein lies a big part of our problem. [Our evolved brains have allowed
us to escape the simplicity of the hunter-gatherer environments from
which they originated. This very progress has left the door open for
problems to creep in because [we cannot easily escape our evolutionary
heritage.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The legacy of our hunter-gatherer brains and bodies lives on in us.
[[Biological evolution cannot keep pace with cultural and technological
evolution.]{.mark} The problems caused by the discrepancies between our
ancestral and modern living environments is known as an [evolutionary
mismatch](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/darwins-subterranean-world/201701/evolutionary-mismatch-and-what-you-can-do-about-it).
[Simply put, we did not evolve to live in the world in which we now
live.]{.mark} While we are adaptive creatures, we cannot so easily
liberate ourselves from the adaptations that evolved over the millennia
to help our ancestors survive in a world that is very discrepant from
our own. In a manner of speaking, we perceive the modern world through
ancient eyes.]{.underline}

Oh, What a (Wicked) World!

[[An evolutionary mismatch]{.mark}]{.underline} does not, of course[,
explain [all of the world\'s problems. The world is extremely
complicated]{.mark}, and we can\'t point to a single cause to the myriad
of problems in life. Strangely enough, this tendency to search for
simple answers to complex problems can be viewed as another
manifestation of evolutionary mismatch.]{.underline}

We are drawn toward more concrete answers because our ancestors evolved
in a world in which more short-term, casual thinking was adaptive.
That\'s primarily the type of thinking that our ancestors needed for
survival. Find food, water, shelter, a mate, and stay alive. Life was so
simple in those "good old days!"

A way of looking at the difficult challenges in this modern world comes
from the work of [Dr. Robin Hogarth and his
colleagues.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721415591878) In
their research, they proposed that there are kind and wicked learning
environments. Importantly, \"kind\" does not mean \"good,\" and
\"wicked\" does not mean \"evil\" in this context. Rather, kind learning
environments are simple, straight-forward cause-and-effect
relationships---if I do this, then that will happen. Feedback in these
kind learning environments is quick and accurate. Hunting and gathering
food were conducted by our ancestors in kind learning environments.

In contrast, wicked learning environments are complicated ones.
Cause-and-effect relationships are hard to see, and predictions are
difficult to make. Feedback is infrequent, inconsistent, and often
delayed in time. Moreover, in wicked learning environments, the feedback
can be mismatched with the outcomes. This can result in us learning the
wrong lessons.

The Evolution of a Quandary

Our magnificent brains evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to
solve problems and challenges to increase our survival in a kind but
often brutal world. Our ancestors didn't have to wrestle with wicked
problems, such as geopolitical instability, improving the quality of
national health care systems, the impact of lifestyle decisions on [the
environment](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/environment) over
time, saving
for [retirement](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/aging),
managing global pandemics, determining the most equitable and functional
taxation system, and resolving international trade disputes. Our brains
evolved to help us to adapt, survive, and pass on
our [genes](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/genetics). They've
succeeded at this, in part, through the creation of these wicked
learning environments (e.g., political and monetary systems) that are
very discrepant from our evolutionary origins. Paradoxically, these
wicked learning environments are filled with complicated problems that
can confound our poor noggins.

Grinch, From the Grinch Who Stole Christmas

Our Biases in a Wicked World

[Psychologists have identified scores of [cognitive
biases](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bias) that affect our
perceptions and judgments. From one perspective, these biases distort
reality, but they do this (largely) because fitness beats reality. They
are
an [unconscious](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/unconscious) way
of reducing complexity
in [decision-making](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/decision-making) that
is rooted in our ancestral, kind learning environments. Cognitive biases
exist because they serve fitness (survival) over reality.]{.underline}
They are like mental shortcuts that allow an organism to make decisions
more quickly to navigate potentially life-or-death situations.

Yet, because the modern world is so wickedly complicated and mismatched
with that of our ancestors, cognitive biases contribute to some
troublesome problems. It is as if our brains are trying to solve the
challenges of wicked learning environments with the same cognitive
biases that helped our ancestors survive.

This begs the question: What was most critical for our survival as a
species in our ancestral world? The answer is one another. Our ancestors
were able to evolve because they learned how to work together in groups.
A strong tribal community meant survival. A contentious, dysfunctional
tribe, or a life in isolation, meant death.

The problem is that our ancestors [evolved in tribes of 100-150
people](https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/social-media-affect-math-dunbar-number-friendships).
In our wickedly complex world, we are still \"wired\" to be tribal, but
our modern world is so vastly different from those small, nomadic
hunter-gatherer groups. This big evolutionary mismatch is the root of
some major problems we are seeing in America and across the world now.
Much of the hatred, the vitriol, the polarization, and the \"us vs.
them\" mentality in
our [politics](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/politics) is an
outgrowth of mismatched tribalism.

\"A house divided against itself will not stand.\" ---Jesus, Matthew
12:25 of the New Testament

When it comes down to it, tribalism trumps reality. This is not a
\"left\" or \"right\" problem. It is a human problem. Importantly, we
need to transcend the toxic levels of political division, or we will
suffer even more of the painful consequences. I will tackle this in my
next series of blogs, so please join me!

ancestral and modern living environments is known as an [evolutionary
mismatch](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/darwins-subterranean-world/201701/evolutionary-mismatch-and-what-you-can-do-about-it).

ancient eyes.]{.underline}

[[An evolutionary mismatch]{.mark}]{.underline} does not, of course[,
explain [all of the world\'s problems. The world is extremely
complicated]{.mark}, and we can\'t point to a single cause to the myriad
of problems in life. Strangely enough, this tendency to search for
simple answers to complex problems can be viewed as another
manifestation of evolutionary mismatch.]{.underline}

We are drawn toward more concrete answers because our ancestors evolved
in a world in which more short-term, casual thinking was adaptive.
That\'s primarily the type of thinking that our ancestors needed for
survival. Find food, water, shelter, a mate, and stay alive. Life was so
simple in those "good old days!"

A way of looking at the difficult challenges in this modern world comes
from the work of [Dr. Robin Hogarth and his
colleagues.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721415591878) In
their research, they proposed that there are kind and wicked learning
environments. Importantly, \"kind\" does not mean \"good,\" and
\"wicked\" does not mean \"evil\" in this context. Rather, kind learning
environments are simple, straight-forward cause-and-effect
relationships---if I do this, then that will happen. Feedback in these
kind learning environments is quick and accurate. Hunting and gathering
food were conducted by our ancestors in kind learning environments.

In contrast, wicked learning environments are complicated ones.
Cause-and-effect relationships are hard to see, and predictions are
difficult to make. Feedback is infrequent, inconsistent, and often
delayed in time. Moreover, in wicked learning environments, the feedback
can be mismatched with the outcomes. This can result in us learning the
wrong lessons.

The Evolution of a Quandary

Our magnificent brains evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to
solve problems and challenges to increase our survival in a kind but
often brutal world. Our ancestors didn't have to wrestle with wicked
problems, such as geopolitical instability, improving the quality of
national health care systems, the impact of lifestyle decisions on [the
environment](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/environment) over
time, saving
for [retirement](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/aging),
managing global pandemics, determining the most equitable and functional
taxation system, and resolving international trade disputes. Our brains
evolved to help us to adapt, survive, and pass on
our [genes](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/genetics). They've
succeeded at this, in part, through the creation of these wicked
learning environments (e.g., political and monetary systems) that are
very discrepant from our evolutionary origins. Paradoxically, these
wicked learning environments are filled with complicated problems that
can confound our poor noggins.

Our Biases in a Wicked World

[Psychologists have identified scores of [cognitive
biases](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bias) that affect our
perceptions and judgments. From one perspective, these biases distort
reality, but they do this (largely) because fitness beats reality. They
are
an [unconscious](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/unconscious) way
of reducing complexity
in [decision-making](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/decision-making) that
is rooted in our ancestral, kind learning environments. Cognitive biases
exist because they serve fitness (survival) over reality.]{.underline}
They are like mental shortcuts that allow an organism to make decisions
more quickly to navigate potentially life-or-death situations.

Yet, because the modern world is so wickedly complicated and mismatched
with that of our ancestors, cognitive biases contribute to some
troublesome problems. It is as if our brains are trying to solve the
challenges of wicked learning environments with the same cognitive
biases that helped our ancestors survive.

This begs the question: What was most critical for our survival as a
species in our ancestral world? The answer is one another. Our ancestors
were able to evolve because they learned how to work together in groups.
A strong tribal community meant survival. A contentious, dysfunctional
tribe, or a life in isolation, meant death.

The problem is that our ancestors [evolved in tribes of 100-150
people](https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/social-media-affect-math-dunbar-number-friendships).
In our wickedly complex world, we are still \"wired\" to be tribal, but
our modern world is so vastly different from those small, nomadic
hunter-gatherer groups. This big evolutionary mismatch is the root of
some major problems we are seeing in America and across the world now.
Much of the hatred, the vitriol, the polarization, and the \"us vs.
them\" mentality in
our [politics](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/politics) is an
outgrowth of mismatched tribalism.

\"A house divided against itself will not stand.\" ---Jesus, Matthew
12:25 of the New Testament

When it comes down to it, tribalism trumps reality. This is not a
\"left\" or \"right\" problem. It is a human problem. Importantly, we
need to transcend the toxic levels of political division, or we will
suffer even more of the painful consequences. I will tackle this in my

### 2AC \-- AT: Cap causes Genocide

#### Other factors causes genocide, not cap 

**Williams**, 20**16** (Timothy, research fellow at the Centre for
Conflict Studies at Marburg University. "Why Genocide Occurs" October 6,
2016. [https://kh.boell.org/en/2016/10/06/why-genocide-occurs

Abstract.\
Why do genocides occur? This paper applies qualitative comparative
analysis (QCA) to revisit this question, and analyses 139 cases of
genocide and non-genocide. [The paper demonstrates the importance of
both [priming, contextual conditions]{.mark} which provide a political
opportunity structure [conducive to genocide, as well as triggering,
more proximate conditions]{.mark} which constitute immanent motivations.
Most centrally, sufficiency is demonstrated for [genocide
occurr]{.mark}ence [when an autocratic regime and]{.mark} the salience
of an [elite\'s ethnicity are present, and are combined with either an
exclusionary ideology or political upheaval]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
such, the autocratic nature of the state provides an opportunity
structure allowing genocide to occur, while the salience of elite
ethnicity can serve as a motivation. Finally, the ideology and the
political upheaval serve as an additional motivation or opportunity
structure, respectively. While political upheaval can play a part in
causing genocide, its role is much more understated than is suggested in
previous literature.

Introduction

Why genocides occur has been one of the central debates within the study
of genocide over previous decades and has been informed by studies from
a range of disciplines. It is an important research endeavour as it is
pivotal to identify the conditions under which genocide occurs if there
is ever to be any possibility of preventing genocide from occurring. In
an attempt to shed fresh light on the debate this paper conducts a
Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) of the 40 genocide cases and 100
non-genocidal incidents which occurred between 1955 and 1998. The data
used here builds on data from the Political Instability Task Force's
State Failure Problem Set as is common in much of the emerging
quantitative genocide literature and in Barbara Harff's seminal
statistical paper \"No Lessons Learned from the Holocaust? Assessing
Risks of Genocide and Political Mass Murder since 1955.\"1 While drawing
on the same dataset as several papers before, this paper takes the
dataset further and interrogates the cases from a new methodological
perspective, QCA. With this alternative method which is based on
set-theory it is possible to tease out deeper insights from the data and
allow for a richer analysis of why genocides occur.

Specifically, QCA provides a method for capturing the general patterns
of genocide occurrence while also allowing for complexity better than
other methods used hitherto, constituting a significant step forward in
the understanding of the causes of genocides. Although genocide is a
complex phenomenon, this paper suggests ways of breaking down central
conditions which coalesce across certain subsets of categories by
applying an alternative methodology thus far not used to address this
question. [This paper demonstrates that QCA -- which is neither
traditionally qualitative nor quantitative -- is a suitable and possibly
preferential methodology for studying genocide occurrence as it uses
Boolean algebra to identify multiple pathways to genocide with different
combinations of conditions acting as causes of genocide in different
cases. QCA systematically [provides different profiles of condition
combinations which provoke genocide outbreak, thereby identifying
necessary and sufficient conditions.]{.mark} This paper demonstrates
that sufficient and necessary causes can be found when examining
genocides. The findings are less parsimonious than previous statistical
results but offer a more realistic picture of the complex conditions
that can be seen as sufficient or necessary for genocide to
occur.]{.underline} This research, thus, has the potential of providing
a framework for policy makers and civil society actors for anticipating
when genocidal situations are more likely to arise, providing
configurations of conditions of when genocide has occurred in the past.

This paper will first clarify some issues around the concept of
genocide, before presenting a theoretical framework of different
determinants emphasised in previous research and explaining the merits
of the chosen QCA approach. Subsequently, the case and condition choice
will be explained in detail, as well as their respective
operationalisations. Finally, the results of the QCA will be presented
and expanded in an empirical analysis, before bringing together these
results to identify the central determinants of genocide and demonstrate
how these results are a step forward for the study of genocide
occurrence.

Why Do Genocides Occur?

This section will discuss various conditions identified previously as
central to causing genocide occurrence. It is helpful to split them into
two types of categories: priming, contextual conditions and motivating,
triggering conditions. [The first priming conditions provide a context
which is opportune for genocide, and suggest [conditions can help to
overcome certain societal or international restrictions;]{.mark} these
conditions should as such not suffice to cause genocide, but instead
[they necessitate a triggering conditions]{.mark}, something about why
key actors want genocide to occur and thus instigate it. In the
following discussion of various conditions, the presence of an
autocratic regime and an economically autarkic economy can be seen as
setting the context, while an exclusionary ideology has a more
triggering character; other conditions could play into both categories
to varying degrees.]{.underline} It is to be expected that any situation
of genocide arises out of a context conducive to it, combined with
triggering motivations. Thus, the QCA solutions are expected to combine
several of the following conditions to create individually sufficient
pathways to genocide. Genocide is taken here to mean \"the promotion,
execution, and/or implied consent of sustained policies by governing
elites or their agents---or, in the case of civil war, either of the
contending authorities---that are intended to destroy, in whole or part,
a communal, political, or politicized ethnic group.\"2 This definition
of genocides and politicides is the foundation of Harff's comprehensive
list of genocides and politicides which underlies the dataset used in
this paper.

#### Most commonly cited cause of genocide is political upheaval 

**Williams**, 20**16** (Timothy, research fellow at the Centre for
Conflict Studies at Marburg University. "Why Genocide Occurs" October 6,
2016. [https://kh.boell.org/en/2016/10/06/why-genocide-occurs
///](https://kh.boell.org/en/2016/10/06/why-genocide-occurs%20///) MF)

Political Upheaval

[[The most commonly cited determinant of genocide]{.mark} occurrence, in
both qualitative and quantitativestudies, is [political upheaval and
direct threats to governments]{.mark} which also finds a prominent
position in Harff's study]{.underline}.3 Harff defines political
upheaval as \"an abrupt change in the political community caused by the
formation of a state or regime through violent conflict, redrawing of
state boundaries, or defeat in international war.\"4 In this context,
Melson and Krain emphasise the importance of revolutions,5 but it is
also a category in which decolonisation or other radical system changes
or collapses would equally be well placed. [The logic behind all these
is that political upheaval provides a context and a political
opportunity structure which is conducive to starting genocide. With the
constraints of a previous system removed, the [legitimacy of the
political community and its identity]{.mark} (including which groups
constitute it) [can be called into question]{.mark}.6 Political upheaval
provides the opportunity to re-define the demos, the circle of people
included as constituents of the state, in a deinstitutionalised
setting.7 In the context of political upheaval, rules of conduct between
the state and its population can [become re-defined and enable a regime
intent on genocide to implement a new eliminationist policy]{.mark}. The
period of transition, and the often concurrent chaos, [can also serve as
a smokescreen for action against the targeted group,]{.mark} given that
internal and external observers could be distracted by other
macro-political transformation processes.]{.underline} Besides providing
a contextual background[, [political upheaval can also be a motivational
impulse and thus trigger genocide]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In the
throes of political upheaval, reigning elites may feel particularly
threatened by certain groups they believe could try to exploit the
upheaval to topple them, and thus desire to have these groups removed.
The empirical founding of the impact of political upheaval since World
War II is immense and Harff finds a significant impact on the risk of
genocide occurrence, while Krain suggests that extra-constitutional
changes (a similar concept) have a significant impact on this
likelihood.8

#### Genocide is caused by war

**Williams**, 20**16** (Timothy, research fellow at the Centre for
Conflict Studies at Marburg University. "Why Genocide Occurs" October 6,
2016. [https://kh.boell.org/en/2016/10/06/why-genocide-occurs
///](https://kh.boell.org/en/2016/10/06/why-genocide-occurs%20///) MF)

War

[[A]{.mark} further [condition]{.mark} often [associated with genocide
occurrence is]{.mark} war,9 and for Krain a country's involvement in
[civil war is the single most significant determinant of
genocide]{.mark} occurrence in his statistical study.]{.underline}10 War
is here defined as \"a contested incompatibility that concerns
government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two
parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in
at least 25 battle-related deaths.\"11 [War can be seen as a contextual
condition which -- as suggested above for political upheaval -- provides
a conducive opportunity structure for genocides to emerge: [war allows
the destruction of a population to happen as other policy options are
closed off or the state becomes increasingly autonomous from other
internal social forces]{.mark}, such as public opinion.12 Moreover, [war
provides the opportunity to scapegoat]{.mark} certain unwanted groups
and portray them as [internal enemies]{.mark} of the state who are
coalescing with the external enemies one is fighting militarily in the
war[, triggering a genocid]{.mark}e against them]{.underline}. Also, in
particular in the context of guerrilla wars, wars can motivate
governments to include genocide in military strategy as rebels are
particularly dependent on their local populations for support and
security.13

Both political upheaval and war thus encompass a political opportunity
structure founded on an exceptional situation which removes the standard
constraints of government from the political elites. However, there are
two key differences between war and political upheaval in the mechanics
of how they affect genocide occurrence. First, political upheaval can be
nonviolent, while war inherently brings with it the internal
mobilisation of arms, minimally through the secondment of military
troops, oftentimes also in the armament of civilian defence groups,
paramilitaries or similar groups. This expansion of available weapons
and their distribution to wider circles of the population make it
possible to then implement a genocidal policy quickly and effectively,
particularly if these civilian or paramilitary groups are encompassed in
a strong military or other hierarchy of authority; furthermore, such
armament and genocidal operations can go largely unnoticed in the more
general context of military war action. Second, war -- both civil and
international -- tends to strengthen the political elites' hold on power
(in the areas under their control) as security fears in the population
can increase popular support and facilitate rallying around the
leadership in order to avert a military defeat; further, war is normally
fought between two or more clearly demarcated parties, while political
upheaval can include struggles for power between unclear and diffuse
constellations of actors. Both these aspects differ fundamentally from
political upheaval in which the political elites wanting to pursue
genocide capitalise on political uncertainty and destabilisation.

#### Structural causes to racism, capitalism isn't one of them

In the 5 years since one of us published "#BlackLivesMatter --- A
Challenge to the Medical and Public Health Communities" in
the Journal,[1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) we
have seen a sea change in the recognition of racism as a durable feature
of U.S. society and of its high cost in Black lives. Elected officials,
corporate leaders, and academics alike use the slogan "Black Lives
Matter," which has also been widely adopted by members of the public,
who by the millions protested the extrajudicial killing of George
Floyd.[2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) [With
this change comes growing recognition that [racism has a structural
basis and is embedded in long-standing social]{.mark} policy. This
framing is captured by the term "structural racism."]{.underline}

[There is no "official" definition of structural racism --- or of the
closely related concepts of systemic and institutional racism ---
although multiple definitions have been
offered.[3-7](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) [All
definitions make clear that racism is not simply the result of private
prejudices held by
individuals,[8](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) but
is also produced and reproduced by laws, rules, and practices,
sanctioned and even implemented by various levels of government, and
embedded in the economic system as well as in cultural and societal
norms.]{.mark}[3,8](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) Confronting
racism, therefore, requires not only changing individual attitudes, but
also transforming and dismantling the policies and institutions that
undergird the U.S. racial hierarchy.]{.underline}

As a legacy of African enslavement, [[structural racism affects both
population and individual]{.mark} health [in]{.mark} three interrelated
domains: redl[ining and racialized residential segregation, mass
incarceration and police violence, and unequal medical
care.]{.mark}]{.underline} These examples, among others, share certain
cardinal features: harms are historically grounded, involve multiple
institutions, and rely on racist cultural tropes.

Redlining and Racialized Residential Segregation

In 1933, the federal government established the Home Owners' Loan
Corporation (HOLC) to expand homeownership as a part of recovery from
the Great
Depression.[8](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) To
guide determinations of mortgage-worthiness, HOLC created maps of at
least 239 U.S. cities. [Using racial composition as part of its
assessment, HOLC staff literally drew red lines (hence "redlining")
around communities with large Black populations, flagging them as
hazardous investment areas whose residents would not receive HOLC loans.
[Redlining made mortgages less accessible,]{.mark} rendering prospective
Black homebuyers vulnerable to predatory terms, thereby increasing
lender profits, reducing access to home ownership, and depriving these
communities of an asset that is central to intergenerational wealth
transfer. Federal mortgages were declined regardless of home loan
officers' racial views; it was not personal.]{.underline}

[This government-sanctioned practice validated other racist maneuvers,
such as restrictive covenants that barred Blacks from home ownership by
means of legal agreements set up by previous owners, undervaluing of
real estate in Black neighborhoods, and mob violence against Blacks who
moved into White neighborhoods.]{.underline} Although redlining
officially ended with the Fair Housing Act of 1968, its impact is seen
today in the social geography of cities. [[Residential segregation
formed a platform for broad social disinvestment, especially in
neighborhood infrastructure (e.g., green space, housing stock, and
roads), services (e.g., transport, schools, and garbage collection), and
employment.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Residential racial segregation remains a powerful predictor of Black
disadvantage.[3,5,9](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) [[There
is a direct legacy of redlining in health and well-being]{.mark} ---
preterm birth, cancer, tuberculosis, maternal depression, and other
mental health issues occur at higher rates among residents of
once-redlined
areas.]{.underline}[3-5](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) [Plausible
mechanisms for the continued health impact of redlining deserve further
study, taking into account exposure to environmental toxins (teratogens,
carcinogens, air pollutants, etc.) and the sustained physical impact of
concentrated psychosocial
stressors]{.underline}.[5,9-11](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) Better
HOLC neighborhood grades are associated with lower levels of airborne
carcinogens and higher levels of tree-canopy coverage (which mitigates
air pollutants and
heat).[12](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) Predominantly
White neighborhoods generally have lower air-pollution
levels,[13](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) while
higher exposures contribute to asthma and low-birth-weight outcomes in
Black
communities.[14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396)

Redlining required the cooperation of government; the banking, credit,
and real estate industries and private developers; as well as
homeowners. Together, these parties helped stoke cultural beliefs that
Blacks made bad neighbors whose presence would lower real-estate values
and increase crime. [Furthermore, the [structural racism]{.mark} that
enables and sustains segregation [facilitates structural racism in other
forms,]{.mark} including mass incarceration and police violence and the
unjust distribution of high-quality health care.]{.underline}

Police Violence and the Carceral State

The United States has the world's highest incarceration rate, and U.S.
police kill civilians far more often than do police in other wealthy
countries.[15,16](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) [A
large body of scientific research documents both racially unequal
outcomes and racial bias in virtually all aspects of the criminal legal
system, with Black people experiencing harsher outcomes in relation to
police encounters, bail setting, sentence length, and capital punishment
than White
people.]{.underline}[17,18](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) [[The
history of courts, prisons, and police as institutions that maintain
racial hierarchy is key to understanding the deeply punitive and
racially unequal nature of the U.S. criminal legal system, with
important and persisting implications for the health of Black
communities.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Contemporary U.S. policing has roots in slave patrols, which were first
established in 18th-century colonial Virginia in an effort to capture
runaways and quell uprisings. After the abolition of slavery and the
short-lived progress of the Reconstruction Era, police and prisons
served as key institutions for reasserting White dominance, especially
in the South. Law enforcement sanctioned, enabled, and participated in
the lynching of Black people, which White mobs typically carried out
under the pretext of punishment for crime; in reality, lynching often
had broader economic and political
motives.[19](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) Southern
White people also used police and prisons to enforce vagrancy laws and
the convict-leasing and sharecropping systems in order to compel
formerly enslaved people to return to the fields --- "slavery by another
name," as one author famously put
it.[20](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396)

By the time Congress passed the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, lynching had
become rare and the convict-leasing system had been long abandoned. But
just months later, [President Lyndon Johnson declared a "War on Crime,"
which was followed in the next decade by President Richard Nixon's "War
on Drugs," both of which appealed to fears about supposed Black
criminality. These developments portended a sevenfold increase in the
size of the incarcerated population, with Black people incarcerated at
five times the rate for White
people.]{.underline}[21,22](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) As
in the post-Reconstruction era, the development of mass incarceration
also had economic dimensions --- for example, the expansion of prisons
provided employment in White, deindustrialized rural
areas.[23](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396)

The late 1960s also saw a massive spike in police killings of Black
men,[24](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) [and it
was not until the 1980s that the U.S. Supreme Court placed even modest
restrictions on police use of force --- for instance by declaring it
unconstitutional for police to shoot a civilian who is fleeing a crime
scene but poses no harm to
others]{.underline}.[25](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) [[Policing
has long been entangled in other structures that reproduce racism, such
as residential segregation. Police]{.mark} once enforced racial
restrictions in "sundown towns" that excluded Black people outside
working hours; they now disproportionately target Black people who enter
White
neighborhoods.]{.underline}[26](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) The
police activity that resulted in Breonna Taylor's fatal shooting by
police in Kentucky has been tied to an "urban revitalization"
plan.[27](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396)

Policing and incarceration have profound adverse consequences for the
health of Black people. Some of these consequences are direct --- police
use of force kills hundreds of Black people each year and nonfatally
injures many thousands more[. [Incarcerated people --- who are
disproportionately Black --- face a high risk of death after
release,[28](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) and
prisons and jails have been major sites of disease transmission during
the Covid-19
pandemic.]{.mark}]{.underline}[29](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) [[There
are also indirect effects ---]{.mark} for instance, police violence can
harm mental health for entire communities through constant surveillance
and threat of
violence,[30](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) and
the churn in and out of incarceration can result in community spread of
sexually transmitted infections or other infectious
diseases,]{.underline} such as
Covid-19.[31](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396)

The notion that police reform alone will solve police violence is
incomplete and misleading. A structural racism lens allows us to see how
policing and prisons have served their intended purpose of social
control of the Black population, which has long been enforced by
violence. For effective change, we must determine which sectors (such as
mental health and social services) should be involved in equitably
addressing public safety without necessarily requiring a police
response.

Unequal Health Care

[[Modern American medicine has historical roots in scientific racism and
eugenics movements]{.mark}. Scientific racism reified the concept of
race as an innate biologic, and later genetic, attribute using
culturally influenced scientific theory and
inquiry.[32](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396)]{.underline} American
scientists, such as Samuel Morton, continued this tradition, using
anatomical features such as skull size and volume to categorize races in
ways that enshrined White
superiority.[32,33](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) The
modern eugenics movement swept through the United States in the early
20th century, leading to laws prohibiting "miscegenation" and the forced
sterilization of undesirable "races" in an effort to create a better,
more intelligent, Whiter
nation.[32](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396)

[Well-respected medical doctors cast Blacks as innately diseased and
dehumanized their suffering, using scientific arguments to provide the
illusion of neutrality and objectivity]{.underline}. For instance, in
1851, Southern physician Samuel Cartwright described "drapetomania," a
"mental illness" that he claimed caused enslaved Africans to run away
from their confinement; he argued that it could be prevented by keeping
Black people in submission and could be cured by
whippings.[34](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) Cartwright
also "discovered[" dysaesthesia aethiopica, a "disease" in Black people
characterized by reduced intellectual ability, laziness, and partial
insensitivity of the
skin.]{.underline}[34](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) Similarly,
physician J. Marion Sims, who was hailed as the father of modern
gynecology, owed his signal accomplishment of vesicovaginal fistula
repair to repeated operations performed, without anesthesia, on enslaved
Black women --- women for whom informed consent had no
meaning.[35](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396)

Racialized conceptions of susceptibility to disease persist to this day.
In its 2003 report Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic
Disparities in Health Care, the Institute of Medicine reviewed more than
100 studies and concluded that bias, prejudice, and stereotyping
contributed to widespread differences in health care by race and
ethnicity.[36](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) [That
call to action went largely unheeded. Fifteen years later, the 2018
National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Report documented that
Black, American Indian and Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian and
Pacific Islander patients continued to receive poorer care than White
patients on 40% of the quality measures included, with little to no
improvement from decades
past.[37](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) [This
unequal treatment is based, at least in part, in enduring racist
cultural beliefs and practices]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, in a
2016 study to assess racial attitudes, half of White medical students
and residents held unfounded beliefs about intrinsic biologic
differences between Black people and White people. These false beliefs
were associated with assessments of Black patients' pain as being less
severe than that of White patients and with less appropriate treatment
decisions for Black
patients.[38](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396)

It would be short-sighted to think that individual prejudice and
discrimination alone drive substandard care. [[The systematic
disinvestment in public and private sectors within segregated Black
neighborhoods has resulted in underresourced facilities]{.mark} with
fewer clinicians, which makes it more difficult to recruit experienced
and well-credentialed primary care providers and specialists and thereby
affects access and
utilization]{.underline}.[3](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) Black
communities became medical training grounds and a source of profit,
reinforcing the American medical caste system that we have today.
[Regardless of intent, actions by parties ranging from medical schools
to providers, insurers, health systems, legislators, and employers have
ensured that racially segregated Black communities have limited and
substandard
care.[3](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396)]{.underline}

[Acceptance of this inequitable treatment as "normal" is historically
rooted in and supported by the belief that Black people are
intrinsically disease-prone and, implicitly or explicitly, not deserving
of high-quality care.]{.underline} As with policing, dismantling
structural racism's impact on health care is not an issue of "a few bad
apples"; we must reflect on the ways our everyday, accepted practices
reify race --- [that is, treat the social construct of race as an
intrinsic biologic difference --- thereby exemplifying and contributing
to a broader system of structural racism.]{.underline}

Our Role in Dismantling Structural Racism

[[Structural racism reaches back to the beginnings of U.S. history,
stretches across its institutions and economy, and dwells within our
culture. Its durability contributes to the perception that Black
disadvantage is intrinsic, permanent, and therefore
normal]{.mark}.]{.underline} But considering structural racism as a root
cause is not a modern analogue of the theory that disease is caused by
"miasmas" --- something that's "in the air," amorphous and
undifferentiated. Structural racism functions to harm health in ways
that can be described, measured, and dismantled. Actions to dismantle
racism necessarily involve the whole of society. [[Moving beyond
individual education and personal insight to change policy and social
norms will require the engagement of many institutions, but the medical
and public health communities can contribute directly in at least four
key areas.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The first is embracing the intellectual project of documenting the
health impact of racism]{.underline}. Despite the long and ongoing
history of racism, empirical research showing its impact on health is
rarely published in major medical journals. Although we find the
evidence of the health effects of structural racism to be convincing,
and supported by more than a century of wide-ranging theoretical and
empirical scholarship, it remains marginalized and eclipsed by other
research
priorities.[3-6,39](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) When
leading medical journals address structural racism, it is often confined
to commentaries and editorials, as though these topics are suitable for
discussion but not discovery. Broad agreement is needed --- by funders,
editors, and reviewers --- that racism and inequities in social
determinants of health more generally are topics as valid for research
as biologic markers (and certainly the two can be combined).

[Next, the availability of data that include race and ethnicity must
improve, and efforts to develop and improve measurement of structural
racism need to be supported, particularly those using available
administrative databases]{.underline}. Such work is under way, and we
believe it should be widely
encouraged.[6,40-44](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396)

T[hird, the medical and public health communities need to turn a lens on
themselves, both as individuals and as institutions.]{.underline}
Faculty and students need a more complete view both of U.S. history and
of the ways in which medicine and public health have participated and
continue to participate in racist practices. Reflection includes
recognition of harms arising from the uncritical use of racial
categories, which reinforces implicit assumptions that racial
differences are genetic in origin. Furthermore, it includes measuring
the success of interventions in terms of how well they narrow
inequitable gaps in health (here, between Black people and White people)
instead of focusing solely on the overall population. Rigorous, clear
standards for publishing research on racial health inequities have been
proposed.[45](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396)

Meanwhile, addressing the growing underrepresentation of Black students
in medical
school,[46](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) and the
disadvantage Black researchers face in seeking awards from the National
Institutes of
Health[47](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2025396) should
not wait. We should call into question claims that there is an
inadequate pool of qualified Black applicants to recruit, hire, and
promote.

[Fourth, we should acknowledge that structural racism has been
challenged, perhaps most successfully, by mass social movements. Change
will require policies that restructure the chances for a healthy life
for people of color, righting the wrongs done by the foundational racial
hierarchy that continue to shape everyday life.]{.underline} Organized
medicine and public health have a long history of opposing desegregation
and broader access to care (e.g., Medicare), of barring Black
physicians, of championing scientific racism, and of enshrining race as
a biologic variable. Our fields have much to regret, and we have much
still to offer to right our historical wrongs. Let's not sit on the
sidelines.

### 2AC \-- AT: Cap causes Colonialism

#### Colonialism did not related to capitalism 

**Sennholz 1956** -- \[Hans F. Sennholz taught economics at Grove City
College and was a noted writer and lecturer on economic, political and
monetary affairs; "The Myth of Capitalist Colonialism";
<https://fee.org/articles/the-myth-of-capitalist-colonialism/>; accessed
7/7/22; Lowell-JL\]

Colonies Acquired under Mercantilism and Nationalism

**[The existence of [colonies]{.mark}]{.underline}**, i.e.,
underdeveloped territories dependent on a ruling power, **[[is not a
phenomenon of capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as its enemies so
ardently contend, but of the very absence of it. The colonial empires of
the Western nations were built in periods of mercantilism or rising
nationalism. **[[During]{.mark} the short intervening age of
[capitalism, colonies were considered in herited burdens to be]{.mark}
[disposed of]{.mark} sooner or later]{.underline}**. "Our colonies are
millstones around our necks," said the British stateman, Disraeli, in
1852 when Great Britain was about to embark upon her famous open-door
policy.

**[During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries England, Holland,
France, and Spain were the foremost colonial powers. That was the age of
mercantilism]{.underline}**. And mercantilist ideas led governments to
acquire dependent territories. Every nation endeavored to be
self-sufficient through tariffs, other import restrictions, and
acquisition of colonies. The balance-of-trade theory prevailed and the
notion that one nation's prosperity is another nation's loss and misery
determined international relations. Europe was always fighting or
preparing to fight.

The adherent of capitalism need not defend the acts of mercantilist
governments, for capitalist philosophers and economists have exploded
and opposed the doctrines of mercantilism since the beginning of the
eighteenth century. Even today they are the bitter enemies of the modern
expressions of mercantilist international relations.

**[[The hostile attitude of the fathers of capitalism toward the
existence of colonies can easily be recognized]{.mark} by the role they
played in the American War of Independence.]{.underline}**
**[[They]{.underline}]{.mark}** were the friends of the colonists and
**[[insisted that colonial independence should be granted and
maintained]{.mark} even after the War of 1812]{.underline}**.
**[Furthermore, [has there ever been a more devastating critique of
colonialism written than the one by Adam Smith]{.mark} in his famous
Wealth of Nations?]{.underline}** **[[To attach colonialism to
capitalism is an obvious absurdity.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

## Cap Good

### 2AC \-- Turn: Cap Good - War

#### Capitalist countries have 0.1% chance of going to war

**Gartzke '07** \[Erick; 2007; Professor of Political Science and
Director of the Center for Peace and Security Studies (cPASS) at the
University of California, San Diego; The Capitalist Peace; "Economic
Development," p. 179-180\] SPark

**[[How many wars occur between \"capitalist\"
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**? It is not obvious how to condense the
bundle of factors discussed above into a single variable. Still, IMF
FIN. OPEN. (Low) is probably the best candidate for such a test. Let me
arbitrarily define capitalist dyads as those where the lower IMF FIN.
OPEN score is at least six. This is the closest ordinal value on the
scale to a value at least two standard deviations above the mean
(3.006 + 2 x (1.627) = 6.26). It also produces a subsample of capitalist
dyads that is about 6.9% of the available sample of observations, not
much different from that for democratic dyads (R = 0.1491 for the two
dummy variables). Interestingly, **[[there are no wars in the
capitalist]{.mark} [dyads]{.mark}]{.underline}** either, though the
smaller sample of cases for which data on financial openness are
available means that only about a quarter of the wars are accounted for
in the sample (54 wars, x 2 = 4.0, Pr= 0.045). **[To extend
this]{.underline}** very crude **[test]{.underline}** a bit **[further,
I add]{.underline}** zeros to round out missing observations **[so
that]{.underline}** the capitalist and democracy samples are the same
size and **[all 222 wars appear in the sample]{.underline}**. When I do
this, **[the [capitalist dyads again contain no wars and the
relationship is highly significant (0.1%).]{.mark}]{.underline}** Thus,
both democracies and **[capitalist dyads appear [never to fight
wars]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Still, determining more about these
relation-ships, and their relative impact on war, requires that we move
beyond cross tabs.

#### Development prevents war - increased deterrence and lower gains from conflicts ensure peaceful relationships [\*\*]{.mark}

**Gartzke '07** \[Erick; 2007; Professor of Political Science and
Director of the Center for Peace and Security Studies (cPASS) at the
University of California, San Diego; The Capitalist Peace; "Economic
Development," p. 172\] SPark

If, on the other hand, the value of resources in dis-pute is small or
varies with ownership, then states can be disinclined to fight. Nations
have historically used force to acquire land and resources, and subdue
foreign pop-ulations. War or treaties that shifted control of territory
changed the balance of resources, and power. Sovereigns, and to a lesser
extent citizens, prospered as the state ex-tended its domain.
**[[Development can alter these incen-tives]{.mark} if modern production
processes de-emphasize land, minerals, and rooted labor in favor of
intellectual and financial capital]{.underline}** (Brooks 1999, 2005;
Rosecrance 1996). **[[If the rents from conquest decline]{.mark}, even
as occupation costs increase, then [states can prefer to buy goods
rather than steal them]{.mark}]{.underline}**.31 As the U.S. invasion of
Iraq illustrates, occupying a reluctant foreign power is extremely labor
intensive. If soldiers are expensive, then nations can be better off
\"outsourcing occupation\" to local leaders and obtaining needed goods
through trade.32 At the same time that **[[development leads states to
prefer trade to theft, developed countries also retain
pop-ulations]{.mark} with common identities, cultural affinities, and
political, social, and economic [ties]{.mark}. [These
states]{.mark}]{.underline}** may be **[[reluctant to conquer their
neighbors]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but they are equally opposed to
arbitrary contractions of their borders. Resi-dents of Gibraltar, for
example, prefer British rule, even while Spain, which has fought over
this lump of rock for centuries, is today unwilling to provoke a war.33
The com-bination of a lack of motive for territorial expansion and
continued interest in serving and protecting a given pop-ulation ensures
a decline in conflict among states with developed economies, especially
where developed coun-tries are geographically clustered (Gleditsch
2003). Since most territorial disputes are between contiguous states
(Vasquez 1993), I hypothesize that developed, contiguous dyads are more
powerful than either developing or noncontiguous dyads.34

HI: **[[Development leads]{.underline}]{.mark}** contiguous **[[dyads to
be less likely to experience conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### 1AR \-- Ext: Cap Good - War

#### Capitalism precedes democracy in the cause of peace

**Gartzke '07** \[Erick; 2007; Professor of Political Science and
Director of the Center for Peace and Security Studies (cPASS) at the
University of California, San Diego; The Capitalist Peace; "Economic
Development," p. 180-182\] SPark

This study offers evidence suggesting that **[[capitalism, and not
democracy, leads to peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Additional research is
needed to corroborate, extend, and even refute the find-ings reported
here. One must be circumspect in question-ing a body of evidence as
large and as carefully constructed as that on the democratic peace.
Still, **[economic liberals have long seen in free markets and
prosperity the potential to discourage war]{.underline}**. **[A century
ago, the \"conventional wisdom\" looked more like this study and less
like that of democratic peace researchers]{.underline}**. While past
arguments were clearly simplistic and overblown, there does now seem to
be grounds for reconsidering liberal economic peace theory.

One can reasonably differ with my version of classical arguments, or can
plausibly challenge the assumptions on which my version of the
capitalist peace is built. The statis-tical models I develop, and the
findings that I present, can be altered, possibly in ways that again
show that democ-racy matters. For now, I hope that **[[the claims of
this study are coherent, empirically plausible, and at the very least
intellectually provocative]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What is the
\"larger\" relation-ship between development, capitalism, and democracy?
It might be that democracy actually lies behind the appar-ent impact of
capitalism on peace. Still, **[the [world was not always made up of a
large proportion of democracies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Lit-tle attempt
has been made to rule out the possibility that democracy and peace have
common causes, or that, as has long been argued, **[[development and
capitalism lead both to freer politics and to a more peaceful
planet.]{.underline}]{.mark}** A logical extension of this study is the
exploration of determinants of political and economic liberalism, though
resolving these more complex causal arrows would seem to require a level
of understanding about the determinants of cap-italism and democracy
that is still under construction in comparative politics, economics, and
other fields.

#### Capitalism prevents war - transitioning away from it removes economic de-incentives and sparks war

**Beauchamp'15** \[Zack; June 4; MSc from the London School of Economics
in International Relations; Vox, "Steven Pinker explains how capitalism
is killing war,"
<https://www.vox.com/2015/6/4/8725775/pinker-capitalism>\] SPark

Steven Pinker: Yes, it\'s one of the causes. It\'s **[the theory of [the
capitalist peace]{.mark}: [when it\'s cheaper to buy things than to
steal them, people don\'t steal them]{.mark}. Also, [if other people are
more valuable to you alive than dead, you\'re less likely to kill them.
You don\'t kill your customers]{.mark} or your lenders]{.underline}**,
so the arrival of the infrastructure of trade and commerce reduces some
of the sheer exploitative incentives of conquest.

This is an idea that goes back to the Enlightenment. Adam Smith and
Montesquieu extolled it; it was on the minds of the founders when they
built incentives for free trade into the Constitution.

I don\'t think it\'s the entire story of the decline in war. But I do
think it\'s part of the story. There was a well-known study from [Bruce
Russett and John
Oneal](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~plam/irnotes07/RussettandOneal2001.pdf) showing
**[[statistically]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[countries that engage
in more trade are less likely to get into militarized disputes]{.mark},
and countries that are more integrated into the world economy are less
likely to get into trouble with their neighbors.]{.underline}**

#### **Capitalist Peace Theory proves that capitalism [constrains]{.underline} aggressive governments and reduces [conflict]{.underline}.**

**[[Capitalist peace theory]{.mark} (CPT) has [gained]{.mark}
considerable [attention in i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations
[theory]{.mark} and the conflict literature. Its proponents maintain
that a capitalist organization of an economy pacifies states internally
and externally.]{.underline} They portray CPT either as a complement to
or a substitute for other liberal explanations, such as the democratic
peace thesis, but disagree about the facet of capitalism that is
supposed to reduce the risk of political violence. [Key contributions
have identified three main drivers of the capitalist peace phenomenon:
the [fiscal constraints]{.mark} that a laissez-faire regimen puts
[on]{.mark} potentially [aggressive governments]{.mark}, the mollifying
[norms]{.mark} that a [capitalist]{.mark} organization [creates]{.mark},
and the increased [ability of]{.mark} capitalist [governments to
signal]{.mark} their [intentions]{.mark} effectively in a confrontation
with an adversary]{.underline}. CPT should be based on a narrow
definition of capitalism and should scrutinize motives and constraints
of the main actors more deeply. Future contributions to the CPT
literature should pay close attention to classic theories of capitalism,
which all considered individual risk taking and the dramatic changes
between booms and busts to be key constitutive features of this form of
economic governance. Finally, empirical tests of the proposed causal
mechanism should rely on data sets in which capitalists appear as actors
and not as "structures." If the literature takes these objections
seriously[, [CPT]{.mark} could establish itself as [central theory of
peace and war]{.mark} in two respects: First, it could serve as an
[antidote to "critical" approaches]{.mark} on the far left or far right
[that see]{.mark} in [capitalism a source of conflict]{.mark} rather
than of peace. Second, it could become an [important complement
to]{.mark} commercial [liberalism]{.mark} that stresses the external
openness rather than the internal freedoms [as]{.mark} an [economic
cause of peace]{.mark} and that particularly sees trade and foreign
direct investment as pacifying forces.]{.underline}**

#### **Capitalism is an [anti-imperialist]{.underline} force that uses [financial incentives]{.underline} to avoid wars.**

**[[In the eyes of]{.mark} the various [CPT]{.mark}
approaches]{.underline}, such conjectures underestimate the costs of
radical political change and especially of using force to enact it.
[Most [causal mechanisms]{.mark} that have been [developed to turn
capitalism]{.mark} and other facets of open economies [into]{.mark} a
[force of peace]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather than a warmongering
culprit, stress what [economists call "opportunity costs" (Schneider,
2014b). In the context of war and peace, these [costs represent]{.mark}
the [foregone profits of entrepreneurs]{.mark} and investors [in]{.mark}
times of [war]{.mark}.]{.underline} Opportunity cost reasoning is found
in the early writings of Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter
(1918--1919, p. 3) at the end of World War I and shortly before he
became, for a very brief period, Minister of Finance in the Republic of
German-Austria.2 [Setting the stage for what would become the
"capitalist peace" thesis]{.underline}, he distanced himself sharply
from the contributions by Hilferding and Luxemburg to Marxian thinking,
dismissing imperialism as "the objectless disposition of a state to
expand violently." [[Capitalism is,]{.mark} in the Schumpeterian
perspective, [an anti-imperialist force that allows economic agents to
accumulate wealth and that constrains the desire of atavistic states to
start colonial wars.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**During the protectionist interwar years and after the student
radicalization of the 1960s, overt admiration of capitalism and its
potentially beneficial consequences, most famously summarized in
Schumpeter's notion of "creative destruction," remained quite unpopular
despite Rummel's (1983) daring libertarian interpretation of peace. It
therefore took the weakening of the Soviet Empire and the new wave of
globalization in the 1980s and 1990s before analysts dared to openly
analyze the positive externalities of capitalism. [Some of the initial
contributions were inspired by rent-seeking theory, which transformed
development policymaking in this period (Tullock, 1980). Condemning
excessive state regulation, advocates of this liberal approach recommend
internal and external [economic]{.mark} [openness]{.mark} as one of the
[key precepts of gaining economic strength]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
policy recommendations culminated in the pro-austerity "Washington
Consensus," which lenders like the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
officially followed from the 1970s to the end of the 2000s in their
conditional financial aid packages but often did not fully implement
(Kentikelenis et al., 2016).**

**It was also in this period that academics started to systematically
explore the security implications of economic openness. Most of these
contributions, with the partial exception of the encompassing argument
by Weede (1995), focused on economic interdependence as a source of
peace and not internal economic freedom (Barbieri & Schneider, 1999; for
recent reviews see Schneider, 2014a, 2014b, 2017). This situation
started to change in the 2000s when a continuation of stock market
record highs seemed to prove the superiority of the loose regulatory
schemes associated with capitalism over more restrictive forms of
economic governance. Since the controversial era that paved the way to
the Great Recession, [proponents of CPT have debated why [open market
economies]{.mark} should be [more peaceful internally and
externally]{.mark} and why the proposed causal mechanisms outshine the
explanatory power of other liberal research programs]{.underline}.**

**[Small States, Norms, and Signaling Capacities]{.underline}**

**An influential literature in comparative political economy contends
that there is a "variety of capitalisms" to the effect that different
political arrangements shape open market economies (Hall & Soskice,
2001). Without paying attention to these contributions, CPT proponents
stress specific aspects of capitalism as the ultimate economic force of
peace. Three schools of thought are associated with the contributions
that economists Hayek, Keynes, and Spence made to the understanding of
market economies. The causal mechanisms that have been proposed all go
beyond simple opportunity cost reasoning and stress the pacifying impact
of small states, capitalist norms, and enhanced signaling capacities.**

**[The Hayekian Perspective]{.underline}**

**McDonald (2009) developed an institutional argument that drew at least
partly on Friedrich Hayek's libertarian classic The Road to Serfdom
(1944/1971). Speaking of a Smithian [["invisible hand of peace,"]{.mark}
Hayek expected that "governments possessing access to large quantities
of public property are more likely to engage in military conflict than
governments overseeing more privatized economies]{.underline}" (p. 17).
According to this logic, [high public spending and extensive public
property allow governments to insulate themselves from the demands of
society.]{.underline} This fiscal cushion reduces the risk of being
punished for adventurous policymaking and allows governments to pursue
aggressive foreign policies or arms build-up programs for which the
taxpayer ultimately has to foot the bill[. Private property and the
pressure from international competitors, conversely, limit the abilities
of executives to chase unproductive ends.]{.underline} McDonald's (2009,
2010) expectation that small states create peace echoed Hayek's
(1944/1971, p. 242) vision that "we shall all be the gainers if we can
create a world fit for small states to live in."**

**Weede's (1995, 2003, 2010, 2021) and McDonald's (2009, 2010) Hayekian
contributions differed with respect to the role attributed to other
liberal forces. [McDonald (2009) suggested that the [pacifying impact of
internal economic openness]{.mark} dwarfs the corresponding effects of
democratic political competition and trade]{.underline}, while Weede saw
these forces as interrelated and, to some extent, as complements of each
other. In Weede's (1995, p. 524) view, "[[free trade promotes peace via
prosperity]{.mark} and democracy." Economic growth can, in his adaption
of rent-seeking theories, be best achieved through the slashing of state
monopolies and other instruments through which vested interests try to
maximize their income]{.underline}. The detrimental role that special
interest groups can play was identified by Tullock (1980) and others and
was further developed by Olson (1993, 2000). Security can, in this
perspective, be provided by what Olson calls "stationary" rather than by
"roving" bandits. While the latter rulers rob everything they can get
without considering the long-term implications of the predation, the
former must limit their rapacity and start to provide public goods.**

#### Capitalism acts as a deterrent for nuc war 

**Blechman,** Siebson and Sisson **et al,** 20**20** (Barry, PhD in

The eruption of violent, radical Islamist backlash in the early 2000s,
however, and its continuation today demonstrates that socio-political
diffusion cuts both ways. So, too, does China's international rise call
into question the extent to which values, ideology, and identity will
drive national strategies in the coming decades. China's influence in
the Indo-Pacific region, after all, has been won not with a galvanizing
socio-political message, but rather through the creation of financial
structures and trade regimes with, and direct investments in, the
economies of growth-hungry neighbors, both regionally and those more
far-flung. 

The [[United States,]{.mark} too, [uses the integration of]{.mark} its
[economy]{.mark} with those of others through trade, finance, and
investment for political purposes. Opportunity to export to the large US
market, to import its goods, and to access its services are sizable
inducements, while exclusion and, especially, expulsion from them can
impose considerable pain. Economic sanctions in particular have
increasingly become a tool of influence]{.underline} -- while not new,
their use has grown steadily since World War II, and accelerated
markedly after the end of the Cold War (Figure
1.1). [4](javascript:void(0)) Indeed, in the 44 years between 1946 and
1990 the United States initiated at least 191 sanctions on 74 states; in
the 27 years between 1991 and 2018, those numbers increased to 252
sanctions on 101 states. 

[[Economic power, of course, also is the foundation of conventional and

peace really is a 'capitalist]{.mark} [peace']{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The rhetoric value of this term is greater than its precision. In
effect, Gartzke's argument draws on several of the effects of
socio-economic development reviewed above. **[[Interdependence and
mobility of assets are equally important]{.mark} as the particular
economic freedoms and financial structures traditionally associated with
'capitalism']{.underline}**. Echoing Rosecrance, Gartzke (2007: 172)
argues that development 'leads **[states to prefer trade to
theft']{.underline}**, but does not weaken their resolve to defend their
borders. At the same time, developed states are typically militarily
powerful and are able to wage wars over long distances. Since many wars
are fought over non-territorial issues (e.g. to defend a particular
political system in another state, or to prevent the development of
nuclear capabilities), developed states are willing to fight
long-distance wars where conquest is not the motivation. This leads
Gartzke to expect that **[[development leads contiguous dyads to be less
likely to experience militarized interstate disputes]{.mark} and
non-contiguous dyads to be more likely to do so]{.underline}**. He finds
**[support for both these hypotheses, and finds that the terms
representing the democratic peace are non-significant when controlling
for the 'capitalist' factors]{.underline}**. Gartzke & Hewitt (2010)
obtain similar results for international crises.

[Behold the paradox of this pandemic moment: Large corporations are
political villains, derided on the left and right. Yet the main, and
perhaps **[only, reason the Covid-19 scourge is easing is vaccines
developed by Big Pharma.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Few are more acutely aware of this paradox than Alex Gorsky, CEO of
Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare device, pharmaceutical and
consumer-goods company best known for products like Band-Aids and
Tylenol. Politicians have vilified his industry over prescription-drug
prices, and trial lawyers for using talc in its baby powder, which it
discontinued in North America in 2020. But now [[J&J]{.mark} is a
[household name]{.mark} in the best way [for developing]{.mark} its
[single-shot Covid vaccine]{.mark}, which the Food and Drug
Administration approved for emergency use last month. The vaccine is
increasing the U.S. supply of shots at a critical time and will
[enable]{.mark} a [billion people]{.mark} world-wide [to be
vaccinated]{.mark} this year.]{.underline}

[[J&J's road to]{.mark} the [vaccine]{.mark}---from failure to
life-saving success, from investment write-off to breakthrough---is a
little-known [story about]{.mark} science, **[business risk and
innovation]{.mark}**. There are also **[lessons for those who think
capitalism is merely about]{.mark} rapacious
[profit]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

["We would [never be in]{.mark} the [position]{.mark} where we are
[today if]{.mark} we had [not invested billions]{.mark} of dollars [over
decades]{.mark} so that we could respond]{.underline}," Mr. Gorsky, 60,
says in an interview the Monday morning after the FDA authorized its
Covid vaccine. The U.S. Army veteran had been up since 3:30 a.m.,
getting in one of his early-morning workouts before meetings.
[[J&J]{.mark}'s Covid-19 [vaccine development]{.mark} over the last year
has been [a sprint, but]{.mark} the [process]{.mark} that led to it has
[been a]{.mark} decades-long [marathon]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Vaccines such as those for polio, MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) and
seasonal flu have been made from weakened or inactivated
viruses]{.underline}. But patients often produce a weak immune response
to the inactivated viruses, and shots that use weakened viruses can make
immunocompromised people sick. [The manufacturing process is also
laborious.]{.underline}

Scientists over the past couple of decades have been studying a
potentially more efficient and effective method known as a "vector
vaccine": using genetically engineered viruses to prime the immune
system by delivering parts of a pathogen's genetic code into human
cells. Our cell machinery then manufacturers the dopplegangers. The
harmless look-alikes trigger an immune reaction, marshaling antibodies
and white blood cells. When the real pathogen invades, the immune system
is prepared.

"Your body has multiple layers of response in these situations. There's
the immediate response, and there's the longer term response," Mr.
Gorsky says. "Your body recognizes the virus and begins producing
antibodies, as well as T-cell and B-cell response."

B-cells produce antibodies that act like sentinels and prevent
infection. T-cells provide backup if a virus penetrates the antibodies'
frontline defense and help enlist white blood cells into action.
Antibodies can fade after a few months, but T-cells stick around longer
and have something of a photographic memory. Some people who were
infected with SARS in 2002-04 were found to have T-cells that remembered
the virus a decade later.

[[J&J]{.mark}'s vaccine was found to be [72% effective]{.mark} at
preventing moderate to severe Covid symptoms]{.underline} (meaning two
or more symptoms that don't require hospitalization) in U.S. trials.
That's less than the 95% of the Moderna and Pfizer -BioNTech vaccines,
which received emergency-use authorization earlier, and which are
followed by a booster a few weeks after the initial shot. But the trials
aren't directly comparable. For one thing, J&J's trial occurred later,
in the fall and early winter, when more virus variants were circulating.
Some variants with changes to their spike protein, which helps the virus
infiltrate human cells, appear to partly elude the antibody response.

T-cells aren't as easily tricked. [One reason [scientists are
excited]{.mark} about J&J's vaccine is that its one shot induces a
robust T-cell response. This means immunity is likely to last
longer]{.underline}---how long remains to be seen---and less likely to
be defeated by new variants.

[Mr. Gorsky attributes the strong multilayered immune response from
J&J's vaccine to its **innovative** adenovirus-vector platform, AdVac,
which it has developed over a decade.]{.underline}

Adenoviruses like those that can cause the common cold---so named
because they were first isolated in human adenoids---are easy to
manipulate because they have a large genome. They also don't integrate
their genes into our own. This makes them an ideal tool for
vector-vaccines. The problem is that many people have pre-existing
antibodies to adenoviruses from prior infections, so their immune
systems may try to shoot down the vaccine as if it were a cold.

In 2007 a promising Merck HIV vaccine, which used the adenovirus-5, or
Ad5, failed to prevent infection in the later stages of a clinical
trial. Worse, data indicated that people who tested positive for Ad5
antibodies were more susceptible to HIV infection than people who
received a placebo, a phenomenon known as vaccine-induced enhancement. A
2008 article in the Journal of Experimental Medicine was titled "The
failed HIV Merck vaccine study: a step back or a launching point for
future vaccine development?"

It was the latter. [Merck's HIV-vaccine failure prodded more study of
other adenoviruses like Ad26---the vector for J&J's Covid-19
vaccine.]{.underline} The Dutch biotech company Crucell had been
experimenting with Ad26 in a vaccine to prevent malaria and other
infectious diseases. Unlike with Ad5, antibodies to Ad26 didn't appear
to sabotage the vaccine. In 2009, J&J entered into a partnership with
Crucell to develop a vaccine it hoped could someday prevent infection
from all influenza strains. [Two years later, J&J bought Crucell for
\$2.4 billion.]{.underline}

["At that time we had little to [no experience in vaccines]{.mark}," Mr.
Gorsky says. **[But capitalism entails risk]{.mark}**: Many Crucell
vaccine studies failed, and "we ended up writing down a very significant
portion of our initial investment]{.underline}." Still, Crucell brought
along "two really important technologies that gave seed to what we're
doing today."

[One was the AdVac platform. The other was the PER.C6 manufacturing
technology, capable of mass-producing vaccines quickly and
cheaply]{.underline}. Despite earlier failures, J&J continued to work on
vaccines for Ebola, HIV, Zika and respiratory syncytial virus, all of
which are prevalent in developing countries.

[The company has enrolled more than 150,000 patients in vaccine trials
for these diseases, and last summer the European Medicines Agency
approved its Ebola vaccine. Mr. Gorsky says the trials for other
diseases have made the company confident that its vaccine platform is
safe]{.underline}, even among people who have pre-existing immunity to
its Ad26 vector.

[Conducting trials in the developing world also gave the company's
scientists confidence and knowledge to run global trials for its Covid
vaccine.]{.underline} Most participants in J&J's Covid vaccine trial
lived outside the U.S.---12.7% in South Africa, 17.3% in Brazil and
23.3% in five other Latin American countries. Trials in South Africa and
Brazil showed that J&[J's vaccine could prevent severe illness and
deaths even against new variants.]{.underline}

"When we were debating clinical trial sites, and we asked could they
logistically do this, some of our scientists had personally visited them
and said, 'They can absolutely do this, and I can vouch and validate
that they can,' " Mr. Gorsky says. "That's ultimately what put us in a
position to be able to do such a high-quality trial at that particular
moment, even in the face of those kinds of challenges."

[[J&J]{.mark} was a couple of months [behind]{.mark} some [other]{.mark}
vaccine [manufacturers]{.mark}, in part [because]{.mark} its
[scientists]{.mark} had to make trade-offs to [create]{.mark} a
[single-shot vaccine]{.mark} that [could be mass-produced]{.mark} and
rapidly distributed]{.underline}, including in developing countries. A
single dose needed to produce a robust immune reaction, but not a
reaction so strong that it caused severe side effects.

"[We developed more than a dozen different permutations," Mr. Gorsky
says, "and then we put them through some initial testing and selected
our one candidate that we felt we could get the optimal
balance]{.underline}." J&J's vaccine works by using its AdVac platform
to transport the DNA that codes for the spike protein on the surface of
the coronavirus into human cells.

[[J&J]{.mark} then [work]{.mark}ed [closely with]{.mark} the [FDA
and]{.mark} the [B]{.mark}iomedical [A]{.mark}dvanced [R]{.mark}esearch
and [D]{.mark}evelopment [A]{.mark}uthority, another federal agency, on
clinical trials and distribution]{.underline}. Mr. Gorsky says that in
his 30 years working in the pharmaceutical industry, he has never seen
as much collaboration between drug makers and government, with which "we
were sharing information in real time." Drug makers have also teamed up:
"[We all knew that, [while]{.mark} we [competed in the
marketplace]{.mark}, the **[real competition]{.mark} here [is]{.mark}
the [coronavirus]{.mark}."**]{.underline}

[Merck recently agreed to produce J&J vaccines in its
factories]{.underline}. In January Merck stopped development of its two
Covid-19 vaccine candidates after early clinical trials showed weak
immune responses. Merck's vaccines used different virus vectors than
J&J's, but one had shown success against Ebola.

[J&J's vaccine is the third to obtain FDA approval, but preliminary
results from trials on AstraZeneca and Novavax suggest they are also
highly effective.]{.underline} All these Covid-19 vaccines use
innovative technologies that have been developed and tested over decades
on other diseases. AstraZeneca's vaccine is similar to J&J's, but uses a
chimpanzee adenovirus as a vector. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna
vaccines inject the virus's genetic code via mRNA, which instructs human
cells to produce pseudo-spike proteins, which in turn prompts an immune
response. Novavax's vaccine uses re-engineered spike-protein clones.

[About [85% of vaccine candidates fail in trials]{.mark}, and
[those]{.mark} that [succeed]{.mark} have [historically taken 10 to 15
years]{.mark} to develop. It [seems like]{.mark} an [incredible]{.mark}
stroke of [luck]{.mark} and science [that we have so many
Covid]{.mark}-19 [vaccines so soon.]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[But it's
more than that]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [Credit years of research and
investment by drug makers, as well as government collaboration during
the pandemic, which Mr. Gorsky hopes will outlast the
pandemic.]{.underline}

Johnson & Johnson, but the [biopharmaceutical]{.mark}
[industry]{.mark},"]{.underline} he says. ["We [fundamentally

[Recent technological progress makes space ownership debate more
pressing]{.underline}

[The [time has come to shift away from a national to an individual focus
in space]{.mark}]{.underline}

[A clear system of [property rights in space]{.mark} would present [vast
benefits to humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}

A new report, Space Invaders: Property Rights on the Moon, from the Adam
Smith Institute (ASI) argues that [creating a clear system of property
rights in space could turbocharge scientific discovery and **[give all
of humanity]{.mark} a [greater stake in space
exploration.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The 1967 UN Outer Space Treaty (OST), which remains in place as the
vanguard of space regulation, forbids \'national appropriation\' and
also, by effect, individual appropriation in space. Although major
players in space exploration have recently called for change---with some
nations pushing unilaterally for it through domestic legislation---there
has been little movement on the ownership question since the OST first
came into effect.

Report author Rebecca Lowe takes inspiration from renowned English
philosopher John Locke and American political economist Henry George in
setting out a detailed framework for how property rights could best be
applied to celestial bodies. In an extended case study, the paper
explains how rents paid on plots of moon land could be leveraged to
benefit the whole of humanity through alleviating poverty on Earth, as
well as democratising space travel.

Under the proposed system, [[individuals]{.mark} would [compete against
each other for plots of land on the moon]{.mark}]{.underline} (that have
most likely been initially acquired by, or assigned to, particular
nations). This [competition would consist in paying 'rent' for such
plots at a rate determined by supply and demand.]{.underline} Rent
rebates could be given for [[improving the condition of land]{.mark} or
providing for urgent human need]{.underline}s. Governance would
currently depend on international agreement.

The paper concludes by arguing that [[proceeds]{.mark} from moon rents
[could]{.mark} be used to [democratise space travel]{.mark}, meet
current urgent needs [and **fund future space
exploration**]{.mark}.]{.underline} It also [offers a way of
[address]{.mark}ing traditional concerns with property rights such as
the '[first come, first served' problem]{.mark}]{.underline} and the
overriding moral priority of addressing urgent human needs.

Rebecca Lowe, report author and former director of FREER, said:

"[A clear, [morally-justified]{.mark}, and [efficient system]{.mark} for
assigning and governing property rights in space would [present vast
benefits]{.mark} that go beyond financial rewards for people who would
become owners]{.underline}. Such a system would incentivise responsible
stewardship of space, as well as opportunities for new scientific
discovery, democratised space exploration, and much more. The creation
of such a system is long overdue---progress on this issue is frozen
amidst complex legalistic uncertainty. It's time to find innovative ways
to move beyond that."

Daniel Pryor, Head of Research at the Adam Smith Institute, said:

"[Property rights [play a key role]{.mark} in [boosting living
standards, innovation and human dignity]{.mark} here on Earth. The same
would be true if we applied this logic to space]{.underline}, which
presents a unique opportunity to start afresh when designing effective
rules of ownership. With more countries and companies competing in the
space race than ever before, it's [[vital for us to move past the
outdated thinking]{.mark} of the 1960s and [tackle the question of
extraterrestrial property rights sooner rather than
later."]{.mark}]{.underline}

Cini, a physicist, had been a key figure for the science policy of the
PCI, but by 1969 he had become more heterodox and he was expelled in
1970 for cooperating with the Manifesto journal --- a group of
**[[left-wing communists]{.mark} expelled for demanding that the PCI
take a more revolutionary line in alliance with the student movement.
Cini matured a systematic critique of scientism, by combining Thomas
Kuhn and Marxism: he [rejected scientific objectivity and
neutrality]{.mark} and affirmed the social determination of the practice
and epistemological content of science]{.underline}**.63

**[Cini wrote a rebuttal to Sereni's editorial and [criticised]{.mark}
the positive [coverage of the first Moon Landing]{.mark} by Unità.64
Cini saw in the astroculture promoted by [NASA a tool of
capitalism]{.mark} and subverted this interpretation with his own array
of images that stressed the capitalist and imperial character of space
exploration. He [mocked the landing as an empty]{.mark} religious
[ritual]{.mark} that hid the division of oppressors and
oppressed.]{.underline}** After all, it was just by mere chance that the
three astronauts were not in Vietnam, dropping napalm on women and
children. Cini argued that the Apollo Programme was complementary not
alternative to the military complex. No different from Nero's panem et
circenses**[, the [space programme]{.mark} served just to
[strengthen]{.mark} the economic and military [power of
capitalism]{.mark} --- a point also made by Marcuse.65 The Apollo
programme was 'an ignoble deception' to convince common people of 'the
idea that this \[technological\] progress will solve or at least begin
to solve their problems'66 without dismantling capitalism --- an open
challenge to technological fixes.]{.underline}**

**[Cini wrote additional articles for the Manifesto journal,
[challeng]{.mark}ing [the idea that space research would produce]{.mark}
either expanded [knowledge or]{.mark} beneficial [technologies]{.mark}.
He argued that the US and Soviet space programmes produced not
scientific progress but military technology]{.underline}**:
intercontinental nuclear missiles and satellites for surveillance and
communication.67 Economically, the space programme only strengthened
industries tied to the military. Even the ideological character of
Apollo --- bravery, fame, spirit of exploration --- were linked to the
bourgeois system of values. satellites, these **[Cini [dismissed]{.mark}
the [idea that spin-offs justified the space programme]{.mark} --- even
war produced spin-offs. While space technology contributed to
micro-electronics, computers and communication technologies were
luxuries for the rich.]{.underline}** To satisfy the basic needs of the
poor, the money should have been spent on researching medicine and
agriculture: 'Then, it is not rhetorical to argue that those who have
chosen to send two men on the moon condemned to death million other
people with that choice.'68 Scientific research was still to be judged
not on its own merit but on its technological output.

**[Cini advanced a [Marxist interpretation of technology]{.mark}
different from Sereni's. Under capitalism, consumption could not keep up
with rising productive capacity because the labour value of the workers
was appropriated for profit and not turned into wages. In order to
postpone the crisis of insufficient demand, the capitalist state
stimulated [unproductive]{.mark} expenditure, such as [scientific
research]{.mark} or superfluous consumption for the privileged
minority.]{.underline}** Cini argued it was a mistake to distinguish
between productive forces and relations of production to argue for the
neutral character of science or to believe that promoting scientific
progress --- thus technological progress and production --- would hasten
the revolution. Cini said that science was part of capital and oppressed
the workers. Capitalism did not simply 'use' science, it 'shaped'69
science by selecting its priorities and methods; without capitalism,
scientific research would have been different:

**[[There is]{.underline}]{.mark}** then a big **[[gap

countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which were **[[rated much
lower]{.underline}]{.mark}** (49.3 points) for their environmental

are [**[least capitalist]{.underline}**,
**[registered]{.underline}**]{.mark} by far **[[the worst environmental

Anti-capitalist climate activists such as Naomi Klein want to establish
an economic order in which the state has disproportionately greater
power than under capitalism. In her book This Changes Everything:
Capitalism vs The Climate, Klein writes about the need for government
guidelines on \"how often we drive, how often we fly, whether our food
has to be flown to get to us\".

The **[[anti-capitalist prescription]{.mark} [for]{.mark}]{.underline}**
dealing with **[[climate change and pollution is more state planning.

**[[held]{.underline}]{.mark}** the most
**[[power]{.underline}]{.mark}** over the economy, **[[levels

On the contrary, [they were **[far higher than]{.underline}**]{.mark} in

with **[a market economy]{.underline}** system **[in the West and

observed]{.underline}**: \"One of **[the world\'s biggest climate
killers was]{.underline}**, in fact, a country that had abolished
capitalism - **[the GDR]{.underline}**.\" In 1989, the GDR emitted more
than three times as much CO2 for each unit of GDP than the Federal
Republic.

**[Other comparisons also confirm]{.underline}** that **[[abolishing
capitalism leads to more]{.underline}]{.mark}** rather than less
environmental **[[degradation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In 1988, the GDR
emitted 10 times as much sulphur dioxide per square mile as the Federal
Republic (124.5 tonnes vs. 12 tonnes per square mile).

conclude that \"**[no other]{.underline}** industrial
**[civilisation]{.underline}** so systematically and so long **[poisoned
its land, air, and people]{.underline}**\".

Many people will concede that socialism is even worse for the
environment than capitalism, but they are still left with reasonable
doubts: isn\'t economic growth in general bad for the environment? There
is one argument that seems logical, at least at first glance. Because
the earth\'s raw materials are finite, infinite growth is impossible.
This leads many to conclude that, somehow, growth must be curtailed.

But **[based on numerous data]{.underline}** series, the American
scientist Andrew **[McAfee proves]{.underline}** in his book More from
Less **[that [economic growth has decoupled itself from the consumption
of raw materials]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.

As our intellectual journey approaches its end, it is worth looking back
at the long way we have come. We started off by identifying the origins
of the current disenchantment with capitalism and, by extension, **[with
the benefits of [economic growth]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Over several
chapters, we saw how the concept of **[growth is tightly [intertwined
with progress, well-being]{.mark}, liberal [democracy]{.mark}, science
and [innovation]{.mark}, human cultural evolution, relations among
groups in [society, and relations]{.mark} among
countries]{.underline}**. In Chapter 8, we explored how the pressing
**[[need to decarbonize society]{.underline}]{.mark}**, dictated by
climate science, can be made **[[compatible with]{.mark} the
meta-institutional holy trinity of [Western]{.mark} societies:
[capitalism]{.mark}, democracy, and national sovereignty]{.underline}**.
In the process, we have seen that the required **[[green]{.mark}
structural [transformation]{.mark} will [lead to]{.mark} an [upheaval in
production]{.mark}, consumption, transportation, energy generation, food
choices, trade patterns, and geopolitics]{.underline}**. Inevitably,
this innovation wave will generate winners and losers. **[Some products
and [sectors]{.mark} will [experience exponential growth]{.mark}, such
as renewable energies, electric vehicles, battery manufacturers, and
exports of critical raw materials.]{.underline}** At the same time, if
some other employment categories and regions (such as coal-mining
country) are not supported, there are real risks of economic depression
and heightened resentment among affected workers toward the rest of
society.

One fundamental question remains unanswered: What will a green
transition imply for jobs, and the economy more broadly, over the coming
decade? Could it be that a policy agenda designed to make capitalism
green would inadvertently precipitate the end of economic growth? To
conclude this book, we will look to the future of growth in a world of
climate change, mitigation, and adaptation.

**[Growing green]{.underline}**

In the early 1990s, around the same time of the UN's first Earth Summit
in Rio de Janeiro, **[William Nordhaus was the first to sketch an
integrated model of the climate and the economy]{.underline}**: economic
activity produces greenhouse gases, these cause climate change, and the
damage from that change exerts a drag on economic activity, closing the
circle. Nordhaus's Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy Model quickly
became the workhorse model for many policymakers, including the UN's
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and, in the United States, the
Obama administration. Work with the original version of the model
suggested that climate mitigation would damage the economy in the short
term, while the costs of climate change would materialize only in the
long term and be somewhat contained. This led to the conclusion that an
efficient climate policy should tolerate global warming of up to 3.5
degrees Celsius.1 This early, overly optimistic analysis would later be
significantly revised, but its ramifications were far-reaching.

**[Nordhaus's model set the tone for an economic conversation that,
since then, has focused squarely on the cost side of the
equation]{.underline}**. Because the overall costs of climate change
would reveal themselves only in the very long term, scores of
macroeconomists then zoomed in on the short term, analyzing in isolation
the impacts of specific climate mitigation policies on, for example,
gross domestic product or employment. What would the introduction of
carbon pricing do to GDP? Crudely, in a basic economic model, carbon
pricing is a tax on production and therefore likely to be recessionary,
especially in the short run, just like a hike in value-added tax**[. In
a more sophisticated model---one that allows for, say, a [zero-carbon
innovative sector]{.mark} to [emerge]{.mark} and assumes that extra tax
revenues generated by carbon pricing will be fully used for some
[growth-enhancing purpose]{.mark} like lowering income taxes---the
impact is more nuanced.]{.underline}**

Integrating these various policy measures in their large-scale, macro
models, several international organizations have concluded that, if
appropriately crafted**[, [Green Deal packages]{.mark} would at best
have muted impacts on GDP and employment. Estimates of such impacts edge
only slightly above or slightly below zero]{.underline}**.2 The main
variable that differs between the marginally positive and marginally
negative scenarios has been the assumption of what other countries would
do---in particular, whether or not they would also simultaneously
implement carbon pricing. If the assumption is that they wouldn't,
climate mitigation policies are projected to yield worse economic
outcomes, because those companies that were environmentally regulated
would lose international competitiveness. **[As carbon pricing started
to be implemented in certain jurisdictions, skillful econometricians
worked to tease out the effect of these policies and concluded that [the
impact on GDP]{.mark} and employment was generally muted and
occasionally marginally [positive]{.mark}.]{.underline}**3

**[On employment, estimates generally tend to be slightly more benign,
mostly for two reasons. First, greenhouse gas intensity in an economy is
quite concentrated in a small number]{.underline}** of industries. For
instance, the ten most carbon-intensive industries in the EU-25, while
accounting for only 14 percent of total employment, emit almost 90
percent of the CO2.4 Taking these facts into account, modeling exercises
predict that the direct job losses from taxing CO2 emissions will be
rather modest for the wider economy. Second, renewable activities are
more labor-intensive at the moment than carbon-intensive ones. Studies
conducted in the United States, for instance, show that the expansion of
clean energy creates three jobs for each job lost in the fossil-fuel
sector. For each \$1 million shift from fossil fuels to clean energy,
five additional jobs are created.5 Bringing findings like these
together, the UN's International Labor Organization concluded in 2018
that, **[if the goal of the Paris Agreement were fully respected,
[fighting climate change]{.mark} would [create more jobs]{.mark} than it
destroyed.6 A circular economy designed for extensive reuse, recycle,
and repair of goods could also create many new jobs
worldwide.]{.underline}**

Evidence like this persuades many that the green transition will be
broadly economically neutral. As climate-policy expert Simone
Tagliapietra likes to say, the green transition should be characterized
as a shift from fossil-fuel production to carbon neutrality---no more,
no less.7 This might rein in the political tendency on both sides of the
Atlantic to present Green Deals as a new growth strategy---a claim that
should be recognized as analytically unsound, bound to raise citizens'
expectations only for them to be disappointed.

**[The Green Deal economy]{.underline}**

All these modeling approaches take too narrow a perspective to answer
questions on the future of economic growth. For starters, as hinted
earlier, most of the economics literature has concentrated its efforts
on carbon pricing, reducing climate mitigation packages to a mere shift
in taxation, away from labor income and toward carbon emissions. Chapter
8, one hopes, left you convinced that Green Deal packages are much more
encompassing than this single policy element. Measures to accelerate
climate mitigation will catalyze forces in the economy across the board
to launch a large investment wave, designed to kick-start a total
turnaround of economic production.8 At least in the short and medium
term, such a policy package can be expected to boost jobs and domestic
demand. Green Deal policies are also highly targeted and sectorial,
however, which brings us to a main point of contention.

**[Green Deals will [push]{.mark} early-adopting [countries
toward]{.mark} developing comparative advantages in [advanced green
tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}**.9 Mastering technological know-how
in the production methods of the future will inevitably have important
rebalancing effects on competitiveness across the globe.10 And as
climate mitigation agendas radically modify production and the very
structure of the economy, standard macroeconomic models will prove to be
poor tools for assessing their overall impact.11

As a result of changing production and consumption patterns, Green Deals
will redraw the map of trade and investment relations among countries,
influence geopolitics, and redefine economic winners and losers. For
instance, countries specializing in fossil-fuel exports, like Russia or
OPEC members, will likely be on the losing side, unless they manage to
diversify their economic models.12 The green transition will recast
completely the map of knowhow, as basically every production process
must be adapted or reimagined to be climate-neutral and have low
environmental impact, in line with a circular economy. Any countries and
companies currently basing their growth strategies on cheap production
of textiles and fast fashion, for instance, will have to think again;
circular economy principles discourage such practices.13 As production
and consumption changes, comparative advantages will shift, and the
wealth of nations will be defined and contended on a new technological
terrain, which includes the green and digital dimension.

Another issue with current estimations is that, with few exceptions,
macroeconomic and advanced climate models are still not well integrated.
Macro models without a climate dimension are fine if we assume that
climate change and its catastrophic damage are extremely far off in the
future---say, a century away, but more problematic if we are already
observing their consequences today. Macroeconomic models operating in a
vacuum tend to compare two scenarios: climate mitigation versus a
general baseline, meaning a continuation of business as usual. The key,
however, is to understand that business as usual is a nonexistent
scenario. There are only two scenarios ahead of us: successful climate
mitigation, and catastrophic damage from climate change. These are the
two scenarios that must be compared. And when that is done, it becomes
evident that investment in mitigation, and even more so adaptation,
carry huge comparative boosts to future growth. **[When climate and
economic models are appropriately integrated, as they are in the 2020
October World Economic Outlook issued by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), it becomes apparent that the [long-term economic growth
associated with climate mitigation represents]{.mark} a [huge
boost]{.mark} over the baseline scenario.]{.underline}**14

**[Looking more specifically at advanced economies, a large investment
wave, such as the one envisioned by the Green Deal, could permanently
jolt rich countries out of the negative equilibrium of low growth, low
inflation, and low interest rates that afflicted them before
Covid-19.]{.underline}** A green exit from secular stagnation is a
possibility that the IMF acknowledges---without, however, accounting for
it in its recent macro-climate modeling exercise. Once that is taken
into account, the **[[GDP boost]{.mark} for green early adopters would
likely be [magnified]{.mark}.15]{.underline}**

**[For emerging economies, the path ahead is typically presented as an
[odious choice between development and greening]{.mark}. This is a
[false dichotomy]{.mark} built on a wrong premise that there is a
feasible development scenario ahead based on polluting production and
exports]{.underline}**. Moreover, as advanced economies press ahead with
the green transition and globalize climate efforts through measures such
as carbon border taxes, **[the [window for]{.mark} development based on
[polluting products]{.mark} will [rapidly
clos]{.mark}]{.underline}**[e]{.mark}. The real choice now is to catch
the green development train, or else risk being locked into technologies
and products that will soon be outdated. Making large-scale brown
investments today would be like pouring more money into horse carriages
in the early twentieth century, at the dawn of the automotive era.

who would also be future investors. Similarly, over the same period,
gathering pace in the second decade of the twenty-first century, trade
union leaders, workers' pension fund holders, and student unions across
the globe began to ally themselves with divestment campaigns targeted at
university endowment and pension fund managers with the goal of
achieving a just transition to greener economies (International Trade
Union Congress 2020).

Over the past decade, market forces have driven a massive transition
within the energy industry. In 2008, coal provided roughly half of the

Increased production of natural gas has driven energy bills and

Environment](https://www.heritage.org/environment/heritage-explains/the-right-way-ensure-cleaner-environment)

[The energy industry is far from the only sector that has made positive
economic and environmental contributions.]{.underline} For instance, the
cement industry is collaborating with the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology to explore how to refine its processes in ways that will
improve resiliency, reduce emissions and save lives. Investments in
cement, steel, plastic and other building materials will make our houses
and highways sturdier and our products more durable --- with a smaller
environmental footprint.

All of these activities result directly from free enterprise ---
companies providing consumers with the goods and services they want
while using fewer resources and emitting fewer unwanted emissions.

As a country prospers, its citizens are better able to care for the
environment and reduce pollutants emitted from industrial growth. In
fact, The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom and Yale
University's Environmental Performance Index show a strong correlation
between a country's environmental performance and economic freedom
(i.e., its embrace of capitalism).

The bigger problem, typically, is that Washington can't keep up. Policy
and regulations significantly lag behind the pace of innovation, market
trends and consumer preferences. Thus, government ends up retarding
economic and environmental progress.

A significant obstacle to investment in producing or switching to
cleaner energy sources is the lack of infrastructure needed to deliver
the energy to would-be customers. Natural gas offers a cheaper, cleaner
alternative to home heating oil; however, pipeline capacity is lacking
in America's Northeast. Of the 5.7 million American households still
relying on oil heat, 85% are in the Northeast, where nimbyism and
opposition to any carbon-based fuel run strong.

The obstructionism isn't limited to conventional fuels, either.
Efficiently siting and permitting new transmission lines could expand
the consumption of renewable power from, say, Canada, which enjoys a
surplus of hydroelectric power. Additional infrastructure would also
allow energy-intensive manufacturing processes, like the cement
industry, to switch to cleaner, cheaper fuel.

Another sound policy would be to make immediate expensing a permanent of
fixture of the tax code. This would allow newer equipment to come online
faster, improving energy efficiency and the overall economy. The current
system of depreciation raises the cost of capital and discourages
companies from hiring more workers and increasing wages for existing
employees.

[Too often, we use phrases like "balancing economic growth and
environmental protections." [This suggests that more growth necessarily
degrades the environment. But the two aren't mutually
exclusive.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[When America and the rest of the world embrace policies rooted in
economic freedom, both prosperity and the environment flourish. In this

#### Capitalism [necessary]{.underline} to create incentives for protecting the environment

**Block**, 20**21**, \[Walter, Endowed Chair in Economics at the School

Environmentalism, 145-146, HHW\]

[We operate [under a free enterprise]{.mark} economic [system]{.mark}
[that produces plastic]{.mark} milk jugs and redwood picnic tables. The
[market]{.mark} is [therefore responsible for]{.mark} such
[environmental problems]{.mark} as too much plastic trash and too little
conservation of forests. **[So goes a common belief,
anyway]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[In fact, it is governmental failure
to]{.mark} maintain and [defend the institutions of a free
market]{.mark} that is [responsible for]{.mark} the [environmental
damage]{.mark} [caused by]{.mark} private
[businesses]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the case of solid-waste management,
[plastic companies and their customers escape from the cost of disposing
of plastic after the consumer is finished with it.]{.underline} This is
because most [[garbage collection]{.mark} is [organized through]{.mark}
the [public sector]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [cost of disposing]{.mark}
of the plastic and the other waste is [undertaken by the
government]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and a [citizen]{.mark} is typically
[taxed without regard]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the amount of [trash]{.mark}
he [generate]{.mark}s.]{.underline}

[Once the [citizen]{.mark} pays his taxes, he has **[no
incentive]{.mark} to [choose environmentally sound goods]{.mark} because
disposal costs are in effect free to him.**]{.underline} [If, instead,
there were complete privatization of the garbage disposal industry,
those who generate trash would directly pay for disposal
costs]{.underline}. [The owner of a private dump tends to charge tipping
fees that vary with different kinds of trash. The price will be
significantly higher for material that creates toxic waste because the
dump owner will be liable for any harmful leaks]{.underline} from his
site. The hauling firm, which collects the garbage from the homeowner
and must pay the tipping fee, will pass the price onto consumers.
[Consumers, knowing that they will have to pay more for the disposal of
more plastic, will tend to substitute toward less costly, and thus more
environmentally sound, containers]{.underline}. In the jargon of
economists, the negative externality will disappear; the [cost of trash
disposal will be internalized, brought to bear on the responsible
parties.]{.underline} It is clear from this example that the [negative
externality currently related to solid-waste management is a
governmental failure, rather than a market failure. **[By not allowing
the free market]{.mark} to operate, the [government pushes]{.mark} the
[costs of waste disposal onto the taxpayers]{.mark}**. [In a free
market]{.mark} the [price]{.mark} system accurately [enables us to
**compare**]{.mark} **[resources]{.mark} to [determine which]{.mark}
courses of [actions are]{.mark} most [economically and ecologically
sound]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Critics argue]{.mark} [that]{.mark} the
[market fails to consider environmental concerns]{.mark}.]{.underline}
In Making Peace With the Planet , Barry [Commoner insists [that]{.mark}
the [free market system conflicts with a social concern for
environmental quality]{.mark}]{.underline}, and thus argues that
ecologically sound production decisions must be implemented through
planning. [Commoner [fails to realize]{.mark} that [when we turn away
from the market]{.mark}, we are [unable to compare resources and their
values]{.mark}. Nor does he realize that the [incentive
structure]{.mark} in the political sector [fosters]{.mark} an
**[economically unsound approach to the
environment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The distorted incentives that
operate in the public sector are responsible for many of our forest
removal and logging problems. The difficulty stems from the fact that 42
percent of all U.S. land is owned by government. The [public forestry
services do not operate by maximizing the value of their
resources.]{.underline} Rather, they subsidize special interest groups
who in turn support public ownership. [[For
example]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the **U.S. Bureau of Land Management**
([BLM) uses]{.mark} a method known as [chaining]{.mark}, which uproots
trees, leaving holes and unsightly tracks, [to remove trees]{.mark} from
grazing lands.]{.underline} Although [this [costly method]{.mark} is
[seldom practiced]{.mark} in the private sector, the **[BLM]{.mark} has
[no incentive to minimize costs]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It maximizes its
budget by providing subsidized grazing rights for ranchers who in turn
lobby for BLM expenditures. The U.S. Forestry Service subsidizes logging
companies to cut down trees on public lands by building logging roads
for them. The private firms thereby shift some of the costs of logging
onto the public.

[Again, **[prices do not reflect the full costs of environmental
destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Certainly [if]{.mark} the
[business]{.mark} firms actually [owned the land]{.mark}, [they would
better care for it]{.mark} because abusing it would reduce their
prospects for future income]{.underline}. Government ownership of so
much land artificially encourages logging for another reason as well.
Private firms with large landholdings are discouraged from using them
for hunting or recreational purposes; the government provides parks for
these purposes at a zero or nominal price. In the national forest
surrounding Yellowstone National Park, the Forest Service charges no
user fee for elk hunting. This reduces the value of elk resources on
private land and discourages private firms from devoting their forests
to hunting rather than logging. [The [low level of private development
of]{.mark} recreational [land]{.mark} is likewise due to the minimal
prices the federal government charges for the use of its recreational
facilities]{.underline}. Unfortunately, because the federal government
owns the land, environmental groups generally have to work through the
political sector. [They [lobby to persuade]{.mark} the
[government]{.mark} to preserve land, [in conflict with]{.mark} the
opposing special [interests of logging]{.mark}, ranching, and extraction
industries. [If the demand for environmental amenities]{.mark} were
instead [channeled through the marketplace, **tremendous progress would
be possible.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Capitalism leads to the [best]{.underline} environmental conditions -- lack of capitalism causes environmental [crisis]{.underline}

Environmentalism, 143-145, HHW\]

[["**Private enterprise leads to pollution**."]{.mark} [Before]{.mark}
we can [determine whether or not this statement is true]{.mark}, [we
have to define]{.mark} our [terms]{.mark}. [Pollution is]{.mark}
relatively easy]{.underline}. This refers to a private property border
crossing: [[waste]{.mark} matter is [transported from]{.mark} one
[person's holdings to]{.mark} that of [another]{.mark}]{.underline},
either directly or indirectly. It is [important that we interpret
pollution in this manner;]{.underline} otherwise, it can easily be
confused with something that superficially resembles it but is actually
quite different, namely waste disposal. In the latter case, the
byproducts of the processing of goods or services are retained by the
firm which created them. It disposes of them without negatively
impacting others ' rights. [In this case there is no " spillover "
effect nor " externalities " affecting third parties.]{.underline} The
definition we are considering here, then, is a legal definition, not a
physical one. As far as chemical analysis is concerned, it is impossible
to distinguish pollution from waste disposal. In both cases, the waste
material may well consist of identical chemical compounds. The simplest
example of pollution using this terminology is when Mr. Jones dumps his
garbage on Mr. Smith ' s front lawn. That would be a case of direct
pollution. The indirect version occurs when there is an intermediary
between Jones and Smith, such as air or water. Here, Jones first
incinerates his refuse, and prevailing winds carry the same material
over to Smith, his lawn, and his lungs. Alternatively, Jones could dump
this material into a river, negatively impacting Smith who lives
downstream and is forced to use the now polluted water for drinking,
irrigation, and washing.

[Non-polluting [waste disposal occurs when]{.mark} baseball [fans
leave]{.mark} the [stadium littered]{.mark} with peanut shells and beer
cans. **[There is no "border crossing]{.mark}**]{.underline}" in this
case, since ticket prices reflect the cleanup costs. The management
voluntarily disposes of the detritus. Another example would be hiring a
maid to clean one ' s home. There may be garbage strewn all over the
place, but this is not pollution; the maid has agreed to do the cleaning
for the owners. [[What]{.mark}, then, [is]{.mark} a [private
enterprise]{.mark}? This is [not a system where government]{.mark}
[grants]{.mark} special [privileges]{.mark}]{.underline} (subsidies,
protection from competition) to business concerns. Far from it. On the
contrary, [[free enterprise]{.mark} is a [system based firmly on]{.mark}
the premise of [private property rights]{.mark}. [Trespassing and
theft]{.mark} are **[absolutely incompatible with the free market
system]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The market is the concatenation of all
voluntary trades (employment, barter, purchase, rental, sale, etc.)
between mutually consenting parties. [[Under pure]{.mark} and
unadulterated laissez-faire [capitalism]{.mark}, the [only function of
government]{.mark} is to [protect]{.mark} person and [property
against]{.mark} physical [attack from outsiders]{.mark}. We are now
ready to [put]{.mark} these two [elements]{.mark}
[together]{.mark}.]{.underline} Pollution, we have seen, is in effect a
bombardment, an infringement of one person ' s rights by another. [But
the **[essence of private enterprise]{.mark} is [precisely to
prevent]{.mark} [such]{.mark} goings-on. It can therefore be stated,
without fear of contradiction that [private enterprise does not lead to
pollution]{.mark}.**]{.underline} But this way of putting matters is far
too understated. [Actually, **" [market pollution]{.mark} [" is a
contradiction]{.mark}** [in terms]{.mark}. To the extent that there is
private enterprise, there cannot be pollution; it is against the
law]{.underline}. To the extent that pollution exists, [this is prima
facie evidence that the legal underpinnings of capitalism have been
breached]{.underline}; that the law of trespass is not being upheld;
that private property rights are not being defended. [Pollution is a
trespass or border crossing; the sole **[function of]{.mark} a [free
enterprise government is to prevent]{.mark} this**]{.underline} (and
other) [[violations of property rights]{.mark}. **Therefore, the [two
are entirely incompatible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Now it is of course
true that many countries, in many areas of the world, in many time
periods, have been considered to be based on free enterprise principles,
and yet suffered from pollution. This only attests to the inaccuracy of
language. Let us consider one such example, the United States in the
nineteenth century. Up until approximately 1830, the courts had based
their decisions in " nuisance cases " (we would now call them
environmental litigation) on a reasonably close approximation to a free
enterprise legal system. If a farmer could show that the railroad engine
was spewing forth sparks and setting his haystacks on fire, he could
collect damages. If the housekeeper complained that factory fumes were
dirtying the clean laundry she hung on her clothesline, she would
typically be granted a cease-and-desist order. Injunctions were
invariably granted to downstream users victimized by upstream waste
dumping.

Under these conditions, it was clear that [[manufacturers]{.mark} had to
[take into account]{.mark} [third-party effects]{.mark}]{.underline}.
There were strong incentives to use cleaner burning but more expensive
anthracite coal instead of the dirtier but cheaper high sulfur variety;
to install smoke prevention devices; to engage in research and
development aimed at abating nuisances. [There was [even]{.mark} an
"[environmental forensics]{.mark}" industry in the making, dedicated to
[determining guilt for pollution]{.mark}]{.underline}. And when all else
failed, the railroad, the factory owner, and the "upstreamer" could pay
their victims to the latter's satisfaction, thus converting pollution
into waste disposal, and "internalizing" the externalities. [But [in the
1850s]{.mark} and thereafter, a [new philosophy]{.mark} began to
[permeate the legal fraternity]{.mark}. It was [determined]{.mark} that
the "[public good" required economic progress]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
the view of an increasing preponderance of judges, [this could
[only]{.mark} be [attained by supporting
manufacturing]{.mark}]{.underline}. So when the aggrieved victim of
pollution next appeared before the bench, they said, in effect, "Our
primary goal is to facilitate a rising GNP. In order to do so, we must
give carte blanche to polluters. [Your selfish [private property
rights]{.mark} are [in the way of]{.mark} the [greater good]{.mark} for
the greater number, and [must be swept aside.]{.mark}" [Under this
condition]{.mark}, all [market-oriented environmental incentives]{.mark}
came to an [abrupt halt]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Previously,
environmentally sound acts resulted from both selfishness and
benevolence]{.underline}. Now, only the latter could operate, the one
that Adam Smith saw as far less reliable. [[After al]{.mark}l, [why
should]{.mark} the [profit-seeking firm use clean fuel]{.mark}, or worry
about smoke prevention, [when it was not legally responsible]{.mark} for
damages?]{.underline} The few businessmen who did so in any case,
perhaps on moral grounds, put themselves at a competitive disadvantage;
they became more liable to bankruptcy. [The [resulting environmental
crisis]{.mark} was due **[not to free enterprise, but to its very
opposite]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### Criticisms of capitalist system are [unfounded]{.underline} -- the environment does [best]{.underline} under capitalism

**Block**, 20**21**, \[Walter, Endowed Chair in Economics at the School

Environmentalism, 6-7, HHW\]

[According to the [mainstream economic analysis]{.mark}, [libertarianism
is wrong]{.mark}. The problem of airborne [pollution]{.mark} is [not due
to]{.mark} a failure of [government]{.mark} to protect private property
rights. Instead, this comes about because of " [market failure]{.mark},
" a basic [flaw in free enterprise]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pigou (1912, p.
139) gives the **[[classic statement]{.mark} of this
view]{.underline}**: [[Smoke]{.mark} in large towns, which [inflicts a
heavy loss on the community]{.mark}, . . . comes about because there is
no way no to force private polluters to bear the social cost of their
operations]{.underline}. Samuelson (1936, 1970) conveys the same
sentiment in terms of the divergence between private and social costs.
Lange and Taylor (1938, p. 103) are yet [additional [socialists]{.mark}
who [make]{.mark} the complementary [point]{.mark}]{.underline}: A
feature, which [distinguishes a socialist economy from one based on
private enterprise, is the comprehensiveness of the items entering into
the socialist price system]{.underline}. In other words, for some
strange dark mysterious reasons, [[capitalists]{.mark}, under laissez
faire, are [excused from]{.mark} even [considering]{.mark} the physical
[harm]{.mark} they do to the property of others]{.underline} through the
emissions of their smoke particles. [Under socialism, in contrast, the
central planner of course takes this into account, nipping the problem
of pollution in the bud]{.underline}. There is **[[so much wrong with
this scenario]{.mark} it is hard to know where to begin a
refutation]{.underline}**. Perhaps we may best start with an empirical
observation. [[If this criticism of the market were true]{.mark}, one
would expect that, [even if]{.mark} the [Soviets couldn't]{.mark}
successfully [run an economy]{.mark}, [they could]{.mark} at least [be
trusted]{.mark} as far as the [environment]{.mark} is concerned.
[In]{.mark} actual point of [fact]{.mark}, [nothing]{.mark} could be
[further from the truth]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Exhibit " A]{.mark} " is
perhaps the [disappearance of]{.mark} the [Aral and Caspian
Seas]{.mark}, due to [massive and unchecked pollution]{.mark},
[overcutting of trees]{.mark}, and consequent desertification.
[Then]{.mark} there is [Chernobyl]{.mark}, which [caused]{.mark}
hundreds, if not [thousands of deaths]{.mark}.]{.underline} 12
[[For]{.mark} ferry[boats]{.mark} [in the Volga River]{.mark}, it is
[forbidden to smoke cigarettes]{.mark}. This is not for intrusive
paternalistic health reasons as in the West, but because this
[river]{.mark} is [so polluted]{.mark} with oil and other flammable
materials that [there is]{.mark} a great [fear]{.mark} that [if]{.mark}
a [cigarette is tossed overboard]{.mark}**, it [will set]{.mark} the
entire body of [water on fire]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [Furthermore,
[under communism]{.mark}, there was little or [no waste
treatment]{.mark} of sewage in Poland, the gold roof in Cracow ' s
Sigismund Chapel dissolved due to [acid rain]{.mark}, there was a dark
brown haze over much of East Germany, and the [sulfur dioxide]{.mark}
concentration in Czechoslovakia were [eight times levels common]{.mark}
in the United States]{.underline} (DiLorenzo, 1990A). Nor was it a
matter merely of the absence of democracy in the USSR. The ecological
record of the U.S. government, where democracy is the order of the day,
is none too savory. The Department of Defense has dumped 400,000 tons of
hazardous waste, more than the five largest chemical corporations
combined. The Rocky Mountain Arsenal carelessly disposed of nerve gas,
mustard shells, the anti-crop spray TX, and incendiary devices. And this
is to say nothing of the infamous Yellowstone Park forest fire, which
the authorities refused to put out, citing ecological considerations; 13
nor the TVA ' s 59 coal-fired power plants; nor the underpricing and
overuse of land administered by the Bureau of Land Management; nor the
fact that the government subsidizes forest overcutting by building
logging roads. [These are [not examples of market failure]{.mark}.
Rather, they are [instances of government failure]{.mark}: direct
controls and inability or unwillingness to uphold private property
rights.]{.underline}

#### Capitalism needs to have a [larger]{.underline} role -- [without]{.underline} it, the ocean environment [suffers]{.underline}

**Block**, 20**21**, \[Walter, Endowed Chair in Economics at the School

[**Currently, [devastating environmental conditions exist in the ocean
because no one owns the property]{.mark}** and, therefore, [no one
has]{.mark} a [stake in what happens to]{.mark} this resource that
houses an array of valuable assets --- [fish, oil,]{.mark} minerals,
transportation, recreation, [and so on]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Governments cause this wreckage by not recognizing private
ownership]{.mark} of this wealth, except the few miles they own off the
coast for military protection. 1 [If private property were
established]{.mark}, it would [improve]{.mark} the [environmental
problems]{.mark} that occur in the ocean such as [endangered
species]{.mark}, [wetlands devastation, and
pollution]{.mark}]{.underline}. 2 In the ocean, many fish that are near
extinction are specifically the ones seafood eaters love the most, like
Atlantic cod, Atlantic and Pacific salmon, marlin, swordfish, snappers,
tuna, sharks, and Alaskan king crabs (DeMont, 2003[[). No one owns the
ocean or the commodities]{.mark} in it, [so the incentive]{.mark}, which
is similar to the incentive for forest devastation on government land,
[is for people to fish]{.mark} as much as possible.]{.underline}
Therefore, others should not be amazed that these fish are on the verge
of extinction, because they are free-floating assets. The same result
would happen if there were gold nuggets dispersed in the local public
parks. Eventually, people will collect virtually every piece. [[History
serves as a lesson]{.mark}, which is [seen in]{.mark} the [near
extinction of the buffalo]{.mark}. [No one owned this animal]{.mark}
and, so it [fell victim to]{.mark} a [tragedy of the commons]{.mark} due
to excessive hunting]{.underline}. 3 On the other hand, the
[[cow]{.mark} that [was privately owned]{.mark} and existed at the same
time as the buffalo was not subjected to overhunting [and has
lasted]{.mark} until this day]{.underline}. This is because cow owners
invest money in buying, feeding, and protecting their cows. [Therefore,
[when]{.mark} one of their [cow]{.mark}s [is killed]{.mark}, the [owner
faces a cost]{.mark}: loss of the animal in the future. But [if]{.mark}
the [owner kills a buf]{.mark}falo, he faces [no such
cost]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Both]{.mark} these [animals]{.mark} [are of
value]{.mark} for their meat and hides, but, [consequently]{.mark},
[only one]{.mark} was [almost wiped out because]{.mark} of the [lack of
private ownership.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[In 2010, the World Bank launched its own initiative to develop natural
capital accounting.]{.underline} Called Wealth Accounting and the
Valuation of Ecosystem Services (WAVES), it was designed to promote
sustainable development by encouraging natural capital accounting, and
to help develop ecosystem accounts, in the belief that they would ensure
that both development planning and governments consider natural
resources. [By 2013, eight countries--- Costa Rica, Botswana, Colombia,
Madagascar, the Philippines, Guatemala, Indonesia and Rwanda--- had
signed up to WAVES and were developing natural capital accounts for
resources like forests, water and minerals.]{.underline} Since then,
Zambia, Uganda, Myanmar, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam have joined the
program. [At the national level, natural capital accounting has spawned
its own world of complex environmental-- economic transactions. Among
them is a system called 'payments for ecosystem (or environmental)
services' (PES)]{.underline}, a broad term for a wide range of economic
arrangements that attempt to assign a price to ecosystem or
environmental services in order to conserve them. PES was devised to
offer landowners incentives to manage their land to provide an
environmental service, such as maintaining forest cover. [The
longest-running ecosystem services scheme is the Conservation Reserve
Program in the United States, which dates to the 1950s.]{.underline}
Under this scheme, the [US government pays out over US\$1.5 billion a
year to landowners to encourage them to protect endangered wildlife
habitats and environmentally sensitive land.]{.underline} Like so many
of these initiatives designed to account for nature, it appears to work
in nature's favor, as does the experience of Costa Rica (which I discuss

### 2AC \-- Turn: Cap Good - Innovation

#### Capitalism [sustainable]{.underline} -- competitive pressure leads to [innovation]{.underline}, solves every issue.

Sustainable?,\" Schneider Electric Blog,

smarx, HHW\]

Like most of us in the sustainability field, I've come to anticipate the
publication of CEO of Blackrock Larry Fink's annual letter. Over the
past several years, Fink's missive (and its downstream impact on
Blackrock's growing emphasis on ESG) has revolved around responsible
business and the role of the investor to encourage corporate
responsibility.

2022 was no different. Fink's letter (here, if you haven't read it yet)
continued to emphasize the importance of environmental and social issues
in corporate governance. But this year, Fink deviated slightly from his
previous years' message by reinforcing the importance of capitalism.

Those who know me know I'm a dyed-in-the-wool capitalist. I believe,
strongly, that the [[straightest and most efficient path towards
innovation, growth, resource allocation, and]{.mark} yes, [profits, is
through the free market]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Competitive
pressure]{.mark} has [shaped]{.mark} our [human culture for thousands of
years]{.mark}, and [capitalism continues shaping it]{.mark} today.
Without capitalism, many of the things we have and use and the quality
of life we take for granted today may have never become a
reality.]{.underline}

[As the [emphasis on corporate responsibility]{.mark} has [grown]{.mark}
over the past decade, however, [capitalism as a sustainable]{.mark},
resilient economic [system]{.mark} has been [called into
question]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the heart of the matter is the
so-called Friedman doctrine, Nobel Prize winning economist Milton
Friedman's theory that the social responsibility of a business is to
increase its profits. Commonly, the soundness of the Friedman doctrine
is pitted against another economic theory, the tragedy of the commons,
in which individual pursuit of personal gain comes at the detriment of
society.

Part of what is at issue is the matter of economic growth. [A [common
understanding in sustainability]{.mark} is that infinite economic growth
(as supported by capitalist doctrine) [is]{.mark} at odds with a [planet
of finite resources]{.mark}. We [already consume nearly 1.5
Earth's]{.mark} worth of [resources every year]{.mark}]{.underline}, far
overshooting our available natural resources. If anything, we must scale
back this consumption to operate within our planetary boundaries.

[But [can we do that -- and remain capitalist]{.mark}s?]{.underline}

On this point, Larry Fink and I resoundingly agree. **[The [answer is
yes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In fact, Fink argues, capitalism is a road
to sustainability, but it will require the reimagining of how we do
business and generate profits today.

[The [only way]{.mark} we can [maintain infinite growth with finite
resources is through innovation]{.mark}, and through circular innovation
specifically.]{.underline} Stewardship of our natural resources is
becoming a form of significant capital, and that capital is increasingly
at risk. It is, therefore, the fiduciary responsibility of all leaders
to protect natural resources to de-risk business.

[[This]{.mark}, Fink concludes, [means decarbonizing]{.mark}. One of the
greatest risks to our collective natural resources (including people) is
climate change]{.underline}. The faster we can decarbonize, the more
rapidly we reduce this risk.

[But it doesn't stop there; [we must also innovate]{.mark}, knowing that
[how we do business today]{.mark} will [not survive]{.mark} a
[resource-constrained]{.mark} and risk-laden
[future]{.mark}.]{.underline} The business models that served us 100, or
even 50, years ago must be overhauled. We must ascribe value to concepts
and ideas that we may have devalued in the past. [We [must invest,
heavily, in]{.mark} the [development of digital solutions and
services]{.mark} that advance our very human aims of survival while
simultaneously supporting our economic ambitions of growth.]{.underline}

Through this lens, I'd argue that [[capitalism itself is]{.mark}, in
fact, [sustainable]{.mark}. It is the competitive [market
pressures]{.mark} of the next decade that will [help us to
succeed]{.mark} [through]{.mark} the [efficient allocation of]{.mark}
scarce [resources]{.mark}.]{.underline} In fact, in an April 2022
report, BlackRock noted that it expects 75% of its corporate investments
to have net-zero goals by 2030. [[It is the]{.mark} spirit of
exploration and the promise of [potential profit]{.mark} that will
[drive]{.mark} some of our [most talented entrepreneurs]{.mark} and
inventors, and it is the work of those individuals that will [create
new, resilient, sustainable]{.mark}, and circular business
[models]{.mark} that will [allow us to drive profitability]{.mark} and
growth [in the face of finite resources]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**In this chapter we have gained more reason to [doubt that, faced with
the threat of catastrophic climate change, the right move is to curtail
economic growth]{.underline}. That recommendation is predicated on the
delusional principle that, under the pressure of bounded resources,
people will come together and share peacefully what is available. In the
history of past human experience with climate and environmental stress,
and in the principles of evolutionary anthropology and cognitive
science, [there is no evidence that world peace and humanity-wide
sharing would be the most likely outcome.]{.underline}**

**[[Abandoning economic growth]{.mark} would [weaken]{.mark} the [scope
for innovation, exacerbate]{.mark} perceived [scarcity]{.mark}, and
[reduce resilience]{.mark}---and do so just as climate change was
beginning to unleash its powerful effects. It would, in the face of
scarcity and heightened uncertainty, [set off]{.mark} a [scramble for
limited resources as people retreated]{.mark} for protection [to]{.mark}
their nation state [in-groups]{.mark}.]{.underline} We can chastise all
this as offensive to morality, but ignoring these human traits and
historical lessons will most likely take us where we do not want to go.
On the other hand, in my view, our moral compass should guide us all to
try and avoid at all costs a return to a zero-sum world and a
hyperconflictual foreign relations scenario. History shows how, when the
climate and environment start changing, what we should be most afraid of
is intergroup conflict. And the only difference today, with respect to
the past, is that human weapons are much more deadly.**

**As [societies find themselves between a rock and a hard place---facing
catastrophic climate change on one side, and catastrophic
conflict]{.underline} over bounded resources on the other---[the [escape
route]{.mark} is narrow]{.underline} but, given the alternative, must be
pursued.71 In abstract terms, [it [involves]{.mark} using [technological
innovation]{.mark} and human ingenuity to shift away from the logic that
salvation can only come with national sacrifice [for]{.mark} the [global
good]{.mark}]{.underline}, or fairshare valuations, to the logic that
casts decarbonization efforts as investment opportunities.**

**In practical terms, under this new logic, [industrialized countries
can be expected to act enthusiastically as early adopters for green
technologies, attracted by the prizes of being at the forefront of the
next industrial revolution and able to set its standards for years to
come. In turn, this industrial [revolution]{.mark} will [reverberate
through]{.mark} the world, following the standard paths of
[capitalism]{.mark} and globalization]{.underline}, propelled by the
deep-rooted mechanics of emulation, and financed in part by foreign
aid.**

**[This is a race against the clock, and the stakes are as high as world
peace. The [full power of capitalism must be harnessed]{.mark} and
driven [toward]{.mark} achieving speedy
[decarbonization]{.mark}]{.underline}, and it is evident that this will
require an extensive set of policies. In the words of evolutionary
biologist David Sloan Wilson, [the mission is to "direct the process of
cultural evolution toward [planetary sustainability]{.mark}."72 In
practice, this means seizing the viable middle ground between
ineffective laissez-faire policies and illiberal command-and-control
solutions. Chapter 8 lays out an [economic strategy to]{.mark}
jump-[start]{.mark} the [green]{.mark}ing of
[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the societal overhaul that will go
with it.**

#### Capitalism is the root cause of [innovation]{.underline} -- [key]{.underline} to economic [prosperity]{.underline}

**Baumol, 2007** \[William, former junior economist for the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, [Freedom and capitalism in early modern
Europe: mercantilism and the making of the modern economic
mind]{.underline}, Capitalism: The Different Types and Their Impacts on
Growth, 87-89, HHW\]

With rare exceptions, **[[truly innovative entrepreneurs]{.mark} can
[only]{.mark} be [found in capitalist economies]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
where [the [risk]{.mark} of doing something new]{.underline}---and
spending time and money to make it happen---[can be]{.underline}
[handsomely [rewarded]{.mark} and the [rewards]{.mark} safely
[kept]{.mark} (these are key preconditions for entrepreneurial
capitalism,]{.underline} which we will discuss in chapter 5). [Given the
importance of innovation, the virtue of a free-market,
opportunity-maximizing economy is that it taps the talents of the
many]{.underline}. Such an economy is open to continual brainstorming
and experimentation, which pays off be- cause the [people at
large---vast numbers of them, having a diverse mix of skills and
different kinds of knowledge---are more likely to come up with and
implement good ideas than any group of planners or experts]{.underline}.
Thus, the very "un-plannedness" of a **[[free-market economy]{.mark},
which might seem to be a great weakness, turns out to be a [great
strength]{.mark}.]{.underline}** One of us (Baumol) has offered several
reasons why [radical [innovations]{.mark} seem to [emanate from
entrepreneurs]{.mark} rather than large firms]{.underline} (at the same
time being careful to note that most entrepreneurs are replicative
rather than radical).15 For one thing, [successful radical innovation,
if undertaken by the entrepreneur, promises what might be called
"mega-prizes"---hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars of
wealth. Nothing comparable awaits the radical innovator in a large firm,
who might get a special recognition award and a onetime
bonus.]{.underline} Beyond this, paradoxically, studies have found (for
the United States at least) that the typical entrepreneur earns less
monetary compensation than her employee counterpart. [Why then do so
many entrepreneurs willingly engage in what is inherently risky
activity?]{.underline} [Because the additional psychic
rewards]{.underline}---being one's own boss, pride in
self-accomplishment, and so forth---**[make the [entrepreneurial
endeavor worthwhile]{.mark}]{.underline}** even if the entrepreneur does
not gain the mega-prize. This, in turn, [helps explain why entrepreneurs
have a comparative advantage relative to large companies in attempting
to [discover]{.mark} and commercialize [breakthrough
innovations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Because a not insignificant portion of
the entrepreneur's "income" from her activity is psychic, the
entrepreneur is the low-cost provider of radical innovation. Often,
therefore, it is [more economical for the large firm to wait for
entrepreneurs to develop the radical innovations and then buy them
out]{.underline}. Large Firms and the Contagion of Innovation Why then
does this low-wage competitive advantage of the independent
innovator-entrepreneur not extend also to less radical innovations, the
cumulative incremental improvements that are specialties of large firms?
Part of the answer lies in the greater complexity and capital cost of
incremental innovation. A Boeing 777 obviously is far more com- plicated
than the primitive airplane developed by the Wright brothers. It has
taken Boeing a century to continually refine the original airplane into
the complex and rather amazing piece of machinery that is today's modern
airplane. Boeing has accomplished this feat by amassing an army of
engineers and designers and spending billions of dollars---money the
Wright brothers did not have. This, too, is not accidental. By its very
nature, the original revolutionary invention known as the airplane, like
so many that came before and after it, grew ever more complex as it was
repeatedly modified and improved. In this respect, the independent
innovator-entrepreneur was at a marked disadvantage in the financing of
the incremental improvements that have led to the modern airplane. None
of this is to imply that large firms are incapable of radical innovation
or that they never achieve it. The fact is that even in America,
entrepreneurs have not had a monopoly on all radical innovation, and
large second-generation firms are essential to ensure that radical
innovations take root. For example, Bell Laboratories, which was perhaps
the most successful research arm of any major corporation (when it was
owned by AT&T), was responsible for two of the more important big-firm
radical innovations in recent decades: the transistor and then the
semiconductor. These were seminal breakthroughs indeed, but it is also
noteworthy that they helped to launch a wave of innovation by newer,
entrepreneurial firms. In 1958, when American scientists were scrambling
to catch up to the Soviet Union's successful launching of Sputnik, Jack
Kilby at Texas instruments expanded on the Bell Labs work by conceiving
an integrated circuit, a silicon chip containing transistors along with
other circuit elements. [Building upon these two innovations, others
brought to market a series of new consumer and business goods, from
transistor radios to pocket calculators and, eventually, personal
computers]{.underline}---which were developed and commercialized in the
1970s by entrepreneurs at a time when existing firms did not yet see the
value of PCs (an industry launched by another entrepreneur, Steve Jobs,
the founder of Apple). [**[Innovation didn't stop]{.mark} there**. The
PC industry, in turn, gave a huge boost to the fledgling software
industry that also had been launched by cadres of independent
entrepreneurs]{.underline}. Even the legendary start and growth of
Microsoft into one of the world's largest and most profitable companies,
as the pioneer of PC operating systems, thereafter provided a market for
other computer application software. [Advances in computing, in turn,
have enabled advances in biotechnology, a new field started by
university researchers]{.underline} experimenting with recombinant DNA,
which was developed into an industry by entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists. [Computing and biotech have since played instrumental roles
in the emergence of nano- technology---miniature devices no larger than
molecules---that may revolutionize medicine and other fields in ways
that cannot yet be imagined. **No one could have planned these
events**]{.underline}. No one even foresaw them. **[Yet they [led to
entirely new industries]{.mark} [employing millions and
benefiting]{.mark} hundreds of millions (if not [billions]{.mark})
more]{.underline}.** Other countries have witnessed these remarkable
developments and are learning from them. As we discuss in later
chapters, [such countries as Ireland, Israel, and the United Kingdom
have or are in the process of shedding the guiding role of the state in
their economies]{.underline} and putting their bets on entrepreneurs,
with growing and **[even remarkable success]{.underline}**. India, a
long- time practitioner of state-guided capitalism, has embraced
entrepreneur- ship, more by accident than design, in a small but growing
corner of its economy: call-in centers and software design[.
[China]{.mark}, formerly the world's largest centrally planned economy,
has [developed]{.mark} a new form of semi-[state- guided
entrepreneurship]{.mark} that has helped [make]{.mark} that
[economy]{.mark} the world's [fastest growing of the last
decade]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Capitalism's incentive to work [creates]{.underline} [innovation]{.underline} and [improves]{.underline} living standards 

**Baumol, 2007** \[William, former junior economist for the U.S.
Department of Agriculture[, Freedom and capitalism in early modern
Europe: mercantilism and the making of the modern economic
mind]{.underline}, Capitalism: The Different Types and Their Impacts on
Growth, 85-87, HHW\]

Entrepreneurial Capitalism Finally, we come to our fourth category:
[entrepreneurial [capitalism]{.mark}, the capitalist system in which
large numbers of the [actors]{.mark} within the economy not only
[have]{.mark} an [unceasing drive and **incentive to
innovate**]{.mark}]{.underline} but also undertake and commercialize
radical or breakthrough innovations. These [[innovations are
bold]{.mark}er than the incremental innovations that characterize
big-firm capitalism. Together, these [innovations]{.mark}, as improved
and refined by the entrepreneurs themselves or by other existing firms,
have [improved living standards]{.mark} beyond anything our ancestors
could have believed]{.underline}. [Examples include the
[automobile]{.mark} and the [airplane]{.mark}; the telegraph, which led
to the telephone and eventually the [Internet]{.mark}; the generation of
[electricity]{.mark}, which has [transformed]{.mark} the [way we]{.mark}
work and [live]{.mark};]{.underline} and the air conditioner, which has
permitted massive migrations of peoples from colder climates to warmer
climates, not just in the United States but around the world, and
**[[increased worker productivity]{.mark} by no small amount [along the
way]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is just a small sample of the radical
innovations that have trans- formed our lives and have spawned entire
industries around them. They either become "platforms" on which other
products or technologies are built (electricity or personal computer
operating systems, for example), or "hubs" that help create and support
many "spokes" (automobiles and their supplier industries). The
[[industries]{.mark} spawned by these radical innovations in turn
**[enhance productivity]{.mark}** and thereby [**contribute to economic
growth**, both nationally and within regions]{.mark} where new firm
formation is especially strong]{.underline} (Acs and Plummer, 2005; Acs
and Armington, 2004).14 Or, as David Audretsch and his colleagues at the
Max Planck Institute have argued, "[[entrepreneurship]{.mark} makes an
[important contribution to economic growth]{.mark} by **providing a
[conduit for]{.mark} the [spillover of knowledge]{.mark} that might
otherwise have remained uncommercialized**]{.underline}" (Audretsch et
al. 2006, 5). New Firms and Breakthrough Innovations But where do these
radical, breakthrough innovations come from? The answer is that
[[transformational technologies]{.mark}, and hence entrepreneurial
capitalism, would not exist without entrepreneurs, who recognize an
opportunity to sell some thing or service that hadn't been there before
and then act on it.]{.underline} Radical breakthroughs tend to be
disproportionately developed and brought to market by a single
individual or new firm, al- though frequently, if not generally, the
[ideas behind the breakthroughs originate in larger firms]{.underline}
(or universities) that, because of their bureaucratic structures, do not
exploit them (Moore and Davis, 2004, 32). As Jean Baptiste Say noted at
the beginning of the nineteenth century, [[without]{.mark} the
[entrepreneur]{.mark}, "\[scientific\] knowledge might possibly have
[lain dormant]{.mark} in the memory of one or two persons, or in the
pages of literature]{.underline}" (Say, 1834, 81). Although the finding
is now somewhat dated, one thorough statistical study has found that
smaller, younger firms produce substantially more innovations per
employee than larger, more established firms (Acs and Audretsch, 1990).

#### Capitalism is the [only]{.underline} system that [cultivates]{.underline} and [fosters]{.underline} innovation

**Shiller 20** \[Robert Shiller, 11-2-2020, \"Capitalism promotes
innovation in a free market economy,\" No Publication,
https://www.parlia.com/a/capitalism-promotes-innovation, smarx, HHW\]

**[[Capitalism promotes innovation]{.mark} in a free market
economy]{.underline}**

[A free market encourages innovation [because people have incentives to
work harder]{.mark},]{.underline} [which [leads to higher
productivity]{.mark}. Innovation [allows societies to develop rapidly
and gives people]{.mark} a [better]{.mark} [quality of
life.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Capitalism]{.mark} promotes and [rewards innovation]{.mark} from
people and companies]{.underline}. Innovation is encouraged for both
goods and services at all levels.

[[Companies invest in research]{.mark} and development in an effort [to
create better products]{.mark} so that they can sell more and increase
their profits. This [leads to huge advances]{.mark}, especially in
fields like medicine and technology.]{.underline}

The system [[also rewards companies for]{.mark} constantly making
[improvements]{.mark} to already existing products]{.underline} and
technologies.\[1\]

Capitalism [[creates]{.mark} an [incentive]{.mark} for companies to
constantly strive to keep improving because that is how they can earn
the most money[. **These**]{.mark}]{.underline} **continual
[[improvements]{.underline} [benefit consumers]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[because it leads to more choices of goods.]{.underline}

[Due to the [competitive nature of capitalism,
citizens]{.mark}]{.underline} also have an [**[incentive to work
harder]{.underline}**.]{.mark} People know that with creativity and hard
work (the backbone of innovation) they can become the next Bill Gates or
Jeff Bezos.

[This **[results in]{.mark} a culture of [productivity]{.mark}** that
increases overall efficiency**, [allow]{.mark}ing for
[civilizations]{.mark} to [develop rapidly]{.mark}** as new
technological advancements are being made.]{.underline}

#### Efficiency and innovation through capitalism [protect]{.underline} the environment

Nicolas **Loris 19** \[Nicolas Loris, 10-23-2019, \"Breathe Free:
Capitalism Helps Protect the Environment,\" Heritage Foundation,
https://www.heritage.org/environment/commentary/breathe-free-capitalism-helps-protect-the-environment,
HHW\]

Arecent Rasmussen [poll found 20% of voters feel we should eliminate
capitalism to protect the environment. **That's like saying we should
eliminate teachers to improve education.**]{.underline}

[Truth be told, **[capitalism]{.mark} has [helped cleanse our
planet]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [[improving living standards while
protecting the environment]{.mark}. Rather than eliminate capitalism,
**policymakers need to unleash it**.]{.underline}

[**[Markets incentivize efficiency]{.mark} by rewarding people for
coming up with ways to [do more]{.mark} or do better [with
less.]{.mark}** [People choose]{.mark} --- and businesses make --- more
[efficient products]{.mark} because it saves them money while delivering
what customers want.]{.underline}

Over the past decade, [[market forces]{.mark} have [drive]{.mark}n a
[massive transition]{.mark} with[in]{.mark} the [energy
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2008, coal provided roughly half of
the country's electricity generation. Now, coal's share is about a
quarter. [Increased [production of natural gas]{.mark} has
[driven]{.mark} energy bills and [emissions
downward]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[In]{.mark} direct [response]{.mark} to cheap gas, the [Nuclear Energy
Institute]{.mark} organized nuclear [power plants]{.mark}
nationally]{.underline} to find operating efficiencies that have
[[reduced costs]{.mark} by 19%, saving consumers \$1.6 billion and
[keeping emissions-free]{.mark} electricity in the
marketplace.]{.underline}

[The energy industry is far from the only sector that has made positive
economic and environmental contributions]{.underline}. For instance, the
[[cement industry]{.mark} is [collaborating with]{.mark} the
[M]{.mark}assachusetts [I]{.mark}nstitute of [T]{.mark}echnology to
[explore]{.mark} how to refine its [processes]{.mark} in ways that will
[improve resiliency, reduce emissions]{.mark} and save
lives.]{.underline} Investments in cement, steel, plastic and other
building [[materials]{.mark} will make our houses and highways
[sturdier]{.mark} and our products more durable --- [with a **smaller
environmental footprint.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[All of these]{.mark} activities [result directly from free
enterprise]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[companies providing]{.mark}
consumers]{.underline} with the goods and services they want **[[while
using fewer resources and emitting fewer]{.mark} unwanted
[emissions]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[[As]{.mark} a [country prospers]{.mark}, its [citizens]{.mark} are
better [able to care for the environment and reduce pollutants]{.mark}
emitted from industrial growth. In fact, The Heritage Foundation's Index
of Economic Freedom and Yale University's Environmental Performance
Index show a strong correlation between a country's environmental
performance and economic freedom]{.underline} (i.e., its embrace of
capitalism).

#### **Capitalism leads to economic [success]{.underline} and [sustainability]{.underline} -- a switch away would condemn our future. Capitalism is the only way to provide incentive for entrepreneurship**

**Baumol, 2007** \[William, former junior economist for the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, [Freedom and capitalism in early modern
Europe: mercantilism and the making of the modern economic
mind]{.underline}, The Care and Maintenance of Entrepreneurial
Capitalism, 228-89, HHW\]

[[For]{.mark} roughly [a century]{.mark}, the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates has been [the leading economic power in the
world]{.mark}. Part of the [reason]{.mark} for its success [is]{.mark}
that the **[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has been the [quintessential
exemplar of]{.mark} a mixture of entrepreneurial and big-firm
[capitalism]{.mark}**.]{.underline} But can Americans, and others in the
world who are now emulating the U.S. model, safely assume that the
[[American economy]{.mark} will [continue to be]{.mark} as
[successful]{.mark} as it has been in the past?]{.underline} Or is the
United States---like other once-great civilizations (ancient Rome and
Greece come to mind)---doomed in the foreseeable future to fall or at
least stagnate? [We make no claim to be prophets, but we believe that
while there is [much to be optimistic]{.mark}
[about]{.mark}]{.underline}, there also are dangers ahead. In this
chapter, we will celebrate the former and call attention to the latter
in the hope that current and [future [policy makers]{.mark} will [take
steps]{.mark} to [help us avoid]{.mark} the fate to which the
[dangers]{.mark} [could condemn us]{.mark}]{.underline}. Put in a
nutshell, we will suggest in this chapter that one of the [[most
immediate perils]{.mark} facing the U.S. economy is the [possibility of
transforming]{.mark} into a much [less entrepreneurial]{.mark} big-firm
[regime]{.mark}, one characterized by ossification, limited incentives,
and a paucity of breakthrough inventions.]{.underline} There is no
simple formula for preventing such an outcome, but the analysis of this
book suggests the importance [of [two key principles]{.mark}: [provide
incentives]{.mark} for productive [entrepreneurship]{.mark} [and
discourage diversion]{.mark} of entrepreneurial talent [into]{.mark}
unproductive or [destructive]{.mark} sources of
[wealth]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this closing chapter, we will provide a
number of suggestions about how [[best to]{.underline}
[maintain]{.underline}]{.mark} [the critical [balance]{.mark} of
big-firm and entrepreneurial capitalism]{.underline}, in part by simply
bringing together the observations of the two pre- ceding chapters.

Michio Kaku, Professor, City University of New York, US, says that
precedent has shown that physics can drive industrial revolutions and is
the future of wealth.

[Perfect capitalism relies on innovation and people, and social systems
can adapt to the fallout that comes with advancing
technology.]{.underline}

This interview served as input for [The Great
Narrative](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Narrative-Reset-Book-ebook/dp/B09PC4FQRZ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=XG9MK76MYX42&keywords=great+narrative&qid=1642415934&sprefix=great+narrativ%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-1%20),
a new book by Klaus Schwab and Thierry Malleret.

The dedication of Michio Kaku\'s life work to the theory of everything
merged with his fascination with science fiction when he realized that
physics and the future were one and the same.

He argues that wealth is a derivative of physics, that ever-evolving and
perfect capitalism is dependent on innovation, and technology will be
largely linked to our brains.

The below interview with Michio Kaku served as one of 50 inputs from
global thought leaders for The Great Narrative, the new book by Klaus

resilient, inclusive and sustainable future post-COVID-19.

Have you read?

[Mariana Mazzucato on rethinking the state to improve
partnerships](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/01/mariana-mazzucato-on-rethinking-the-state)

Could you share with us something about yourself that we won't find on
the web?

On Wikipedia, you won't find what happened when I was eight years old --
something happened which changed my life completely. A great scientist
had just died; the newspapers printed a picture of his desk with the
unfinished manuscript of his greatest work, and the caption read
something like this: The greatest scientist of our time could not finish
this book.

I was fascinated by this story. What could be so hard that a great
scientist couldn't finish it? Why didn't he ask his mother? Why didn't
he look up the answer at the library?

So I went to the library and found out this man was Albert Einstein. And
that book was the unfinished unified field theory (the theory of
everything), an equation that would allow us to "read the mind of God."
It was an equation, perhaps no more than one inch long, that would
summarise and unify all the laws of the universe. I was hooked. I wanted
to dedicate my life in pursuit of this equation.

Well, that's what I do for a living. The leading theory today is called
string theory. All the hundreds of sub-atomic particles are nothing but
musical notes on a tiny, vibrating string. So physics is the harmony one
can make on vibrating strings. Chemistry is the melody one can play on
strings. The universe is a symphony of strings. And the "mind of God" is
cosmic music resonating through hyperspace.

One version of that equation, string field theory, is my creation. My
equation is one-inch-long and it allows you to summarise all laws of
nature. It's not the final theory; we now know there are membranes in
addition to strings.

But when I was eight, I was also fascinated by science fiction, the
Flash Gordon series. I saw starships, monsters, aliens, cities in the
sky and antigravity beams. But years later, I realized that the two
passions of my life, physics and the future, were the same: if you want
to understand the future, you have to understand physics.

You must understand it at the atomic, molecular and cosmic level, and
that gives us deep insight into what's possible, impossible and
plausible. Sometimes, when I see predictions made by my colleagues, I
shake my head: they don't understand the laws of physics. Certain things
are harder, and some are much easier than what most futurists project. I
like to put the weight of real science behind all my predictions.

Industrialisation is driven by physics

When you say that if you want to understand the world and think about
the world tomorrow, you need to learn physics, you're not talking about
the physical world, are you? You're talking about the social and
economic world, our societies.

To understand economics, you must understand where wealth comes from. If
you talk to an economist, the economist might say, "Wealth comes from
printing money." A politician might say, "Wealth comes from taxes." I
think they're all wrong -- the wealth of society comes from physics.

For example, we physicists worked out the laws of thermodynamics in the
1800s, which gave us the Industrial Revolution, the steam engine, and
the machine age. This was one of the greatest revolutions in human
history. Then we physicists solved the mystery of electricity and
magnetism, which gave us the electric revolution of dynamos, generators,
radio, and television, and then we worked out the laws of the quantum
theory, which gave us the transistor, computers, the internet, and
laser. The three great revolutions of the past all came from physics.

We're now talking about how physics is creating the fourth great
revolution at the molecular level: artificial intelligence,
nanotechnology and biotechnology. That's the fourth wave, but we can
also see outlines of the fifth wave beyond that. That one is driven by
physics at the atomic level, e.g. quantum computers, fusion power and
brain-net (when the human mind is merged with computers). So when you
look towards mid-century, we'll be in the fifth wave, and what drives
all these waves? Physics. And how is it manifested? Through the economy.

So, taxes and printing money are not where wealth comes from. Those
things massage, distribute, and manipulate wealth, but they don't create
it. Wealth comes from physics.

You've had a rich career. What's your big, main idea?

[I have two things to say about this. First, physics is the origin of
all wealth. Second, where is that wealth going to? It's going to create
something I call perfect capitalism. What is capitalism? It's private
ownership where prices are set by supply and demand, but that doesn't
explain where the direction of capitalism is going in the
future.]{.underline}

[[In the future, capitalism will have infinite knowledge of supply and
demand]{.mark}. For example, the internet will be in your contact lens
and, when you blink, you'll see the prices of every object around you.
You'll know the laws of supply and demand infinitely precisely; you'll
know who's cheating you, what the prices are really like, the profit
margins, who the middlemen are and where to find the
bottlenecks.]{.underline}

[Why is Jeff Bezos one of the richest men in the world? Because he
digitized the middleman, part of the friction of capitalism and
eliminated in perfect capitalism. That's why people like Jeff Bezos,
whatever you think of him morally, are part of perfect capitalism. He's
[making capitalism more perfect by eliminating middlemen -- unnecessary,
redundant layers, bottlenecks and friction. Perfect capitalism is where
it's all headed.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Artificial intelligence and computers have just accelerated]{.mark}
that trend. The trend is towards [perfect capitalism]{.mark}, where all
the middlemen, layers and choke points are eliminated, giving us direct
contact between supply and demand. (This, of course, says nothing about
the morality and ethics created by perfect capitalism, only that
[perfect capitalism is the inevitable byproduct of these technological
revolutions]{.mark}.)]{.underline}

[In the future, capitalism will have infinite knowledge of supply and
demand.]{.underline}

---Michio Kaku, Professor, City University of New York, USA

But if we're heading towards a world that's totally transparent, doesn't
it risk also becoming a dystopian world? Is there a risk of everything
being accessible to everybody? Can it be useful for nefarious purposes,
for example?

There will always be hiccups because we're human beings, and because
we're human beings, we'll use laws and social media to stop the march
towards perfect capitalism by saying it's unfair to others, for example,
the middlemen, like brokers. But stockbrokers no longer sell stock --
you can buy stock on your wristwatch. So why do you go to a stockbroker?
Because you want something that a computer can't give you. Computers
cannot give you what human stockbrokers can: experience, savvy, the
inside story, analysis, gossip, i.e. intellectual capital.

We forget that computers today are just sophisticated adding machines,
lacking creativity, innovation, analysis, and leadership, etc. So
middlemen, like stockbrokers, can survive and even flourish under
perfect capitalism if they provide what computes cannot, intellectual
capital.

Now, privacy is another problem, but it's a social problem because mores
change with time. People must decide how far they want to go to embrace
a digital lifestyle and in the process expose their life and personal
finances to potential criminals on the internet; that's a social
problem. This is a universal problem. For example, Mother Nature has
spent 3 billion years combatting viruses. Nature is in a constant,
never-ending battle with viruses. Similarly, we will also be in a
perpetual battle with viruses. But how far we are willing to go to stop
hacking, viruses, malware, etc. depends mainly on the political climate,
not technology.

[So, I'm talking about the big picture -- we're heading towards perfect
capitalism, where middlemen, to survive, must sell intellectual capital.
[We're making the transition from commodity capital to intellectual
capital. That's the big transition in the marketplace]{.mark}. Commodity
capital includes oil and gold, but that's the wealth of the past. The
big billionaires today don't make their billions on gold -- they make it
on data because that's the new wealth of the future.]{.underline}

And that gets us to another question; how far will the robotic
revolution go?

There are three types of jobs that robots cannot replace. The first is
they can't do semi-skilled blue-collar work. Robots can't fix a broken
toilet, pick up random garbage or hammer a nail, and they can barely
open a door. Garbage men, plumbers, carpenters and construction workers
will have jobs in the future. Semi-skilled, non-repetitive blue-collar
work will flourish in the future -- to see this, talk to the Pentagon.

The Pentagon has been trying to perfect the robot soldier for decades,
but they failed miserably because of problems with pattern recognition
and manual dexterity. The second thing robots can't do is conduct human
interaction; robots can't be lawyers, counsellors, professors or people
involved with human relations. Only a lawyer can talk to a judge and a
jury; robots can't do that at all because they don't understand human
mores and changing values.

And third, robots can't be intellectual capitalists -- the people who
make the economy work because of innovation, leadership, new ideas, new
energies and imagination. Robots have none of the above. That's where
humans will come into play. It will be a human-machine partnership. But
certain jobs that are repetitive will be eliminated. We don't have
blacksmiths anymore, but we don't cry about that because the automobile
worker replaced the blacksmith. And automobile workers will have to be
educated to become semi-skilled, blue-collar non-repetitive workers or
human-relation workers or intellectual capitalists.

[[Lasting capitalism requires innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The perfect capitalism model applies to the United States and Western
democracies, but capitalism is currently in retreat. In fact, a model of
autocratic capitalism is prevalent in Asia and China. Do you see perfect
capitalism as a global phenomenon or something that will be confined to
democracies in the West?]{.underline}

[One reason for the Soviet Union's collapse was because many people
realised that prices were based on a fiction -- a simple bureaucrat was
saying, "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, what is the price of this object?" It
totally disregarded the marketplace or what reality would create in the
black market. The black market was more aligned with supply and demand
because that's, of course, where criminals made their
money.]{.underline}

[Governments don't care about supply and demand.]{.underline}

[China has a hybrid system where they realise they must have the
capitalists' technology. What do they do? They beg, borrow and steal;
they absorb whatever technology they can get from established venues, as
long as they are in control.]{.underline}

[But that's not a permanent solution because it doesn't create new value
and new industries. It simply steals, replicates or copies existing
value and doesn't create new ideas. The process of creating new
industries and technology from virtually nothing but an idea is called
lowering entropy.]{.underline}

[To lower entropy requires an enormous amount of freedom to concentrate
imagination, creativity, and brainpower. The Chinese system works
because they've mastered one art: copying. They do not create entirely
new industries, which requires lowering entropy. And as long as they
copy, they'll be at the forefront of the economy only because they have
a lot of labour to go behind it.]{.underline}

[But [capitalism requires more than that, otherwise, it stagnates or
ends up as what the Soviet Union became]{.mark} -- a stagnated economy
where prices had no relationship to actual demand in the society
itself.]{.underline}

[So, your vision is that this future of perfect capitalism will engulf
the world because only capitalist countries can innovate
properly.]{.underline}

[How does physics create wealth? By creating two important things:
energy and information. Physicists are masters of the two because we
created new forms of energy and information. In a system like China's,
they can't generate new forms of energy or information; they can copy it
at the speed of light by borrowing, begging or stealing it, but they
can't create entirely new industries.]{.underline}

[Now, the Chinese aren't stupid. They have a hybrid system, but they
always want to be in control; the supremacy of the Communist Party is of
paramount concern. As long as they are on top, they'll tolerate a lot,
but the bottom line is they won't innovate if it endangers their
control, and that creates a huge problem if they want to become a
cutting edge leader in technology.]{.underline}

[In other words, to be a technological leader and not a follower
requires freedom of ideas and concepts, something which the Chinese
government is reluctant to tolerate. This lack of freedom and innovation
will become more acute as they try to become leaders in the world
economy, not just followers.]{.underline}

The big billionaires today don't make their billions on gold -- they
make it on data because that's the new wealth of the future.

---Michio Kaku, Professor, City University of New York, USA

What's the major change that will make the world a better place? In
fact, if I hear what you're saying, it's to let innovation flourish,
correct?

One thing that will happen is brain-net. The future of the internet is
not digital -- it's neural. We're in the process of digitising the human
brain so that we're compatible with the internet. We can already record
memories and send them on the internet. These are simple memories --
memories in mice; now we're recording memories in primates.

The formation of memories takes place in the hippocampus of the brain,
and they can be encoded and put on the internet. In fact, at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, they've created false memories,
which leads to all sorts of legal and philosophical problems. Next will
be Alzheimer's patients; we'll create a brain chip and, with a push of a
button, memories will flood into their minds. And the US Pentagon will
pay for it because of all the GIs who returned from Iraq and Afghanistan
with spinal cord injuries and were paralysed.

Eventually, the internet will become the brain-net. You will think and
your thoughts will control the world around you. Already people who are
totally paralysed can type on a computer screen, exchange and write an
email; anything you can do on a computer they can also do with certain
limits. For example, the 2014 World Cup in Brazil was opened in São
Paulo by a person who was paralysed. He wore an exoskeleton yet could
still kick a football. A billion people saw a paralysed man start the
World Cup games.

This will revolutionize communications. Why will you watch TV or go to
the movies? They're nothing but two-dimensional screens with sound --
who wants that? In the future, you'll want emotions, feelings and
memories, and you'll want to be one with the actor or actress.

Look at Charlie Chaplin. He was one of the most famous men in the world
until we physicists and engineers perfected mechanical sound. Well, out
went silent movies because who wants to see an actor just dance? You
want to see them sing or talk. In the future, you'll want to see actors
feel as well. That's also going to reduce borders between people.

Sometimes when someone says that certain people are suffering, one
response is to say, "Yeah, I don't believe it." But if you could feel
the suffering of other people and realize that it's genuine, that will
change the way we view human relations. This will also affect the fate
of nations. Children already play video games with people from another
country or continent. They may feel more affinity with a neighbour in a
different continent than with someone in their neighbourhood. And when
they grow up, they will feel differently about people in other countries
than adults today.

Think of what teenagers might also do: instead of putting a happy face
at the end of every sentence, they'll put an emotion, a memory of their
first date, first kiss, first prom, first dance. This is big. No wonder
Elon Musk is checking this out -- he's not stupid.

We, physicists, have been working on this for decades. MRIs allow us to
scan thoughts in the human brain. If you're looking at me, I can extract
the image of myself from your brain using an MRI scan; the MRI machine
can decompose your brain into 30,000 pixels and reassemble them into a
human face. We'll also be able to record dreams in the future.

The first dreams are being recorded as we speak at \[the University of
California at Berkeley -- I've seen the pictures (which, I admit, are
very crude). But the very fact we can talk like this is amazing.

Have you read?

[Like your brain, but smaller: what are neural
networks?](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/05/like-your-brain-but-smaller-what-are-neural-networks)

[Artificial intelligence is learning to interact with the world the way

do](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/12/artificial-intelligence-that-understands-object-relationships)

I was going to ask you about what makes you optimistic, and it seems to
be the fifth wave. When will the fifth wave occur?

[By mid-century, we should have an operating fusion reactor and a
workable quantum computer entering the marketplace. Brain-net will take
a few decades more to get off the ground, but investors are already
jumping into it.]{.underline}

Let me end on this note: I disagree with most futurists. Most will say
technology is morally neutral -- a hammer is morally neutral, a sword
can cut against your enemy or against you. Most futurists will say
there's no moral direction. I would disagree. Because of computers and
the internet, there's a moral direction since the internet spreads
information, spreading empowerment. People realize they don't have to
live like this. Why should they tolerate a dictator? Or poverty? When
other countries have dealt with and solved these questions, it energizes
people in poverty-stricken countries to promote democracy.

So, the democratization of the planet is being driven by the internet,
good or bad (there are bad aspects of it too, of course). But there is a
moral direction. When brain-net comes along, you can feel the joy and
suffering of other people and realise they aren't faking it. If they're
suffering, there's a reason for it, and people can share this common
experience, which will bring us closer together.

Lastly, let me say that one of the keys to creating a bright future is
to educate your people. When I was a child, I learned something called
"the sick man of Asia." China and India, I was told, would be
perpetually poor because of their huge population. But today, we learn
that China and India could become superpowers in the future. What
happened? An ignorant, uneducated peasant is indeed a burden on society,
but once they become educated, they can change the destiny of the world.

#### Cap good -- solves their impacts through spillover of technological innovations

**Baumol 4** \[William J. Baumol, Professor Emeritus at Princeton
University, [The Free-Market Innovation Machine : Analyzing the Growth
Miracle of Capitalism]{.underline}, The "Somewhat Optimal" Attributes of
Capitalist Growth: Oligopolistic Competition and Routinization of
Innovation, Princeton University Press, 40-41 , SMarx, JTong\]

We are left with the following account of the production and
distribution of technology in the capitalist growth process**[. First,
[continued investment in]{.mark} [innovation is ensured
by]{.mark}]{.underline}** the arms-race character of
**[[competition]{.mark} in the high-tech oligopoly
industries]{.underline}** that will be explored in the following
chapter. **[[Such]{.mark} [competition]{.mark} also [forces]{.mark}
firms to [routin]{.mark}ize the [innovation]{.mark} process as a means
[to reduce]{.mark} their [risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[These
incentives are enhanced,]{.mark} not undermined, [by technology trading
and licensing]{.mark}]{.underline}**--- primarily **[[because those
processes serve]{.underline}]{.mark}**, via the access (license) fees,
**[partially [to internalize the externalities of innovative
activity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Second, [innovative activity]{.mark}
by the firm [is stimulated by the requirement for success in
technology]{.mark}]{.underline}**-exchange negotiations that a
negotiating party have something of value to offer to the firm whose
technology it hopes to acquire. Because of licensing and technology
trading, innovations are now disseminated with historically
unprecedented rapidity. **[Rather than benefiting just a severely
limited subsector of the industry and the economy, leaving other
producers to fend with obsolete techniques and products, [the advantages
of technical advances are quickly made available]{.mark} to
all.]{.underline}** **[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}**, too,
**[[can]{.mark} be expected to [make a significant contribution to
economic growth]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

These conclusions suggest that the by some efficiency properties that do
literature. Although it cannot be denied significant imperfections, that
still leaves innovation process may be characterized not seem to be
widely recognized in the that the activity is beset by a number of the
free-market economies with a flow of innovations of unprecedented
magnitude. And even the efficiency-handicapping spillovers of innovation
offer a valuable tradeoff between naked productive efficiency and
acceptable division of its benefits. [**[By distributing the benefits of
technical progress widely among the population]{.underline}**,
**[spillovers enhance the economic health of society and]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[surely [add social value]{.mark} to the growth
accomplishments of the free-market economy.]{.underline}**

#### Capitalism is key to innovation -- incentivizes investment

**Baumol 4** \[William J. Baumol, Professor Emeritus at Princeton
University, [The Free-Market Innovation Machine : Analyzing the Growth
Miracle of Capitalism]{.underline}, The "Somewhat Optimal" Attributes of
Capitalist Growth: Oligopolistic Competition and Routinization of
Innovation, Princeton University Press, 40-41 , SMarx, JTong\]

Finally, **[[the]{.mark} very [profitability of licensing]{.mark} or
technology trading [is an incentive for investment in
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is**[, [the firm that
participates]{.mark} in this market [has]{.mark} [an incentive for
innovative effort]{.mark} that is lacking for the firm that does
not]{.underline}**. The obvious case is the firm that specializes in the
creation and licensing of innovations. Such **[[an innovation factory
will]{.mark} clearly [drive itself out of business if it runs out of
innovative products to offer]{.mark}]{.underline}** for rental. **[An
extension of this argument shows that [this inducement applies to all
firms for which licensing is]{.mark}]{.underline}** a
**[[profitable]{.underline}]{.mark}** activity. Similarly, **[companies
that participate in a technology-exchange consortium must have a supply
of new products and processes that they can offer to the other members
in order to induce them to reciprocate with their own new
inventions]{.underline}**. This will be demonstrated rigorously in the
next chapter. Here, again, one must not overstate the claim. A group of
colluding firms may conceivably agree to mutual disarmament--- to
simultaneous reduction in the amount they invest in innovation. In the
absence of such an agreement, however, **[[the market forces can
confidently be expected to]{.mark} run the other way, to [induce the
firms that license or exchange their technology profitably to spend more
on innovation than they would]{.mark} have
[otherwise]{.mark}.\]{.underline}**
The conclusion, once more, is that **[the market mechanism has
influences not]{.underline}** obviously **[available to
non-[capitalist]{.mark} [economies]{.mark}. These tend to [make it
profitable]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[to]{.underline}** **[engage
simultaneously in the innovation "arms race" and licensing of any new
inventions obtained in the process]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Imperfect
though mechanism may be, **[it]{.underline}** still **[seems remarkably
effective]{.underline}** (see figures and that are make it in the this
6.1 6.2 again), **[and]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** yet
**[[another]{.mark} of the [feature]{.mark}s [that]{.mark}
[differentiate]{.mark} the [free-market growth process from any
other]{.mark}]{.underline}** that we know of.

#### Capitalism improves the quality of life for everyone -- Industrial Revolution proves

**Baumol 4** \[William J. Baumol, Professor Emeritus at Princeton
University, [The Free-Market Innovation Machine : Analyzing the Growth
Miracle of Capitalism]{.underline}, The "Somewhat Optimal" Attributes of
Capitalist Growth: Oligopolistic Competition and Routinization of
Innovation, Princeton University Press, 40-41 , SMarx, JTong\]

Returning, finally, to the central point of this chapter, **[the crucial
fact is]{.underline}** that most of us do recognize the beneficial
spillovers that innovation has contributed and we all seem to agree that
**[[this enhancement of living standards is very
desirable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In other words, **[perhaps without
realizing that we were discussing the spillovers of innovation, we have
concluded that they are a very good thing]{.underline}**. It follows
immediately that, even if zero spillovers were possible and did increase
innovation, they would certainly be far from optimal.

Here[, **[the standard reaction of many
economists]{.underline}**]{.mark}--- that disinterested academicians
cannot take a stand on income distribution on any basis of rigorous
analysis, whatever their personal feeling--- **[[just will not
do]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Of course, **[[no one aspires to a world in
which innovators receive incomes in the trillions]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of dollars (putting Mr. Gates' income into the shade), **[[while the
remainder of the community languishes in]{.underline}]{.mark}**
seventeenth-century **[[poverty]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But if this is
so, then we must also go on to reject the conclusion that spillovers are
incompatible with optimality in the growth process. Once that is
recognized, the remainder is a matter of haggling about the degree of
deviation from zero. My own value judgment on this issue is summed up by
George Bernard Shaw's dictum that there is no crime greater than
poverty, which leads me to believe that the most desirable value of S is
very much large than zero. For, surely, it is widely and appropriately
accepted that **[[the main benefit of the Industrial Revolution is
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** remarkable [**[increase in average per capita
incomes and]{.underline}**,]{.mark} more particularly, **[[in real
wages.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Of course, **[those innovations that have never been born do constitute
a loss to society]{.underline}**. But the point in the analysis here is
that there is an in-escapable tradeoff between two desirable phenomena:
further increases in innovative activity versus diversion of the
benefits to bring society out of poverty, to spread education and health
care, and to finance the better life not just for the fortunate few but
for the population as a whole. Given such a tradeoff, we are back in the
realm in which economists are most comfortable. In Lionel Robbins'
justly noted words, we are back at the allocation of scarce resources
among competing (and desirable) ends. And the analysis of such tradeoffs
is the meat and potatoes of our professional activity.

#### Only the process of capitalism promotes innovation and development

**Baumol 4** \[William J. Baumol, Professor Emeritus at Princeton
University, [The Free-Market Innovation Machine : Analyzing the Growth
Miracle of Capitalism]{.underline}, The "Somewhat Optimal" Attributes of
Capitalist Growth: Oligopolistic Competition and Routinization of
Innovation, Princeton University Press, 40-41 , SMarx, JTong\]

This brings us to the end of the discussion of the reasons for the
unprecedented growth record of the capitalist economies. Undoubtedly
there are both contributory influences and impediments that have been
omitted. But **[[the]{.mark} five [elements]{.mark} that I have
[stressed seem]{.mark} by themselves [sufficient]{.mark} to make this
performance less puzzling: [oligopolistic competition that uses
innovation as a weapon and engages in an innovation arms race, that
routinizes the innovation arms race to reduce its uncertainties, and
that engages in systematic innovation exchange and licensing for
profit]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Together, **[these plausibly constitute a
large part of the story]{.underline}**. The relative decline in the
opportunities for destructive and rentseeking entrepreneurship as
compared with productive entrepreneurial activity, along with the
emergence of the rule of law from the struggles between the kings and
their nobles, arguably also played a particularly critical role in the
rise of capitalism. They continue to be important today. Finally,
**[[the socially beneficial side of the spillovers from innovation
serves as a very valuable offset]{.mark} to any resulting disincentive
to innovative activity]{.underline}**. **[[All of these features]{.mark}
are]{.underline}**, in part or in their entirety, **[attributes of the
free-enterprise economies that [other types of economy]{.mark} either
[do not share]{.mark} or do so to a very limited degree]{.underline}**.
**[[That is]{.underline}]{.mark}**, I believe, **[[a persuasive
explanation of why even the most inventive of]{.mark} [non-capitalist
societies has fallen so short]{.mark}]{.underline}** in terms of
innovation.

#### Capitalism facilitates itself -- innovation increases the efficiency and amount of resources

**Baumol 4** \[William J. Baumol, Professor Emeritus at Princeton
University, [The Free-Market Innovation Machine : Analyzing the Growth
Miracle of Capitalism]{.underline}, The "Somewhat Optimal" Attributes of
Capitalist Growth: Oligopolistic Competition and Routinization of
Innovation, Princeton University Press, 40-41 , SMarx, JTong\]

I turn next to yet another way in which **[[innovation facilitates
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, one that is also not widely
recognized. Ultimately**[, one of the prospective impediments to
innovation is the finite character of the economy's natural
resources]{.underline}** that are critical to utilization of the new
products and processes that innovation provides. **[Thus]{.underline}**,
it may well be suspected that, **[in a world in which the economy's
finite natural resources can only be depleted]{.underline}**, **[this
will raise problems for innovation]{.underline}** that will grow more
serious with the passage of time. After all, most inventions must be
embodied at least partly in concrete material objects, requiring metals,
fuels, and other scarce resources for their utilization, and this may
well become an impediment to innovation--- both to its production and to
its contribution to the economy's output. **[However]{.underline}**, it
can be argued that, in an important sense, **[[the available quantities
of the economy's natural resources can be expanded]{.mark} and, indeed,
that this has actually happened.]{.underline}** This notion may seem
bizarre, yet the fact that, **[[over the decades, the real prices of so
many]{.mark} of these [resources have not been increasing, and]{.mark}
that at least [some of them have]{.mark} actually [declined,]{.mark}
must surely suggest that there is something to this
notion]{.underline}**. And there is a straightforward explanation.
**[[Suppose that inventions constantly decrease the percentage of
petroleum that is lost in]{.mark} the process of [extraction]{.mark}
from a well, [and that another]{.mark} stream of inventions constantly
[increases the number of miles a given quantity of petroleum will enable
a vehicle to travel]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Suppose both of these
developments move far faster than the rate]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[at
which [the earth's]{.mark} fixed [physical stock of oil is used]{.mark}
up]{.underline}**. **[[Then]{.mark} it should be clear that [the
inventory of prospective miles of transportation by petroleum-driven
vehicles can actually have been expanded]{.mark}. [The intellectual
input will]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in effect, **[[have served to
increase the supply of the physical input in the one sense]{.mark} [that
really counts: the still available capacity of that input to contribute
to future output of the economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Each State should then begin by promoting reforms to their national
legislation on migration and, to be worthy of the name and to make them
truly genuine, they should forsake hypocritical policies that keep the
front door of the house open to the wealthy, while the poor are only
allowed access through the service door. All of this happens while
undocumented migrants remain under the Damocles sword threat of flash
detentions and deportations separating them from their family and
children, as happens in the US at the times of Trump. This is a threat
that also serves as a cruel formula for exploitation and de facto
restriction of human rights and labour benefits, as it leaves employees
absolutely defenseless before their employers. **[However, [if we
examine]{.mark} [specific situations and compare]{.mark} migratory
[policies]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the EU with that of the US, **[[it
is evident that Europeans]{.mark} have tried to [stay within]{.mark} the
margins of their own [legality and p]{.mark}olitical
[c]{.mark}orrectness. [Despite]{.mark} the [European economic crisis

[**[Capitalism has created more prosperity and progress for more people
than any system in human history]{.mark}**.]{.underline} On the 30th
anniversary of the official end of the Soviet Union, join the National
Post and Financial Post in a series saluting the unfashionable yet
awesome power of the free-market system. I believe that
[[capitalism]{.mark} in a liberal democratic society is **[by
far]{.mark} the [best system to]{.mark}** [**promote human
flourishing**]{.mark}. It's the **[best]{.mark} economic [system
for]{.mark} the generation of [new wealth]{.mark}**, which is why
[even]{.mark} [authoritarian states like China]{.mark} have [embraced
it]{.mark}.]{.underline} The generation of new wealth is a critical
first step for any debate on redistribution or expanding publicly funded
social services.

As a tech entrepreneur who did not come from economic privilege,
[[capitalism]{.mark} has [provide]{.mark}d me with [opportunities to
generate]{.mark} public and private [wealth]{.mark} on a global
stage]{.underline}. The shift 40 years ago from an industrialized,
[production-based economy to a knowledge-based economy [provide]{.mark}d
[innovative]{.mark} [individuals]{.mark} with [more
power]{.mark}]{.underline} to assert into existing markets or to create
new markets.

[[When entrepreneurs]{.mark} have [access to capital]{.mark}, they can
[channel]{.mark} their [ideas into products]{.mark} and services that
can [improve]{.mark} the [lives]{.mark} of fellow citizens, [industry

allows]{.mark} a [single individual to]{.mark} profoundly [shape
society]{.mark} for the better [and]{.mark} to **[simultaneously]{.mark}
[create public and private good]{.mark} --- this [is why

#### Capitalism is the most [ethical]{.underline} system -- state-controlled systems aren't moral

Capitalism Is Morally Superior,\" No Publication,

smarx, HHW\]

[[Capitalism Promotes Freedom]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The most basic freedom is the freedom to make choices. [Capitalism
promotes choice]{.mark}. It promotes the ability of people to decide
what they want to buy, how much they want to buy, where they want to
live, where they want to work, and so on**. [With statism, choices are
limited]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The government decides, for example,
what kind of light bulb is available, how much water a toilet can use,
the minimum factory efficiency of an air conditioning system, and more.

[[The removal of]{.mark} simple [choices reduces
freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}. The removal of all choices is slavery. The
direction of statism is towards slavery. **[[The direction of capitalism
is towards freedom. Capitalism is morally
superior]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[[Capitalism Promotes Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}

[If I want a new air conditioning system installed in my home, I call a
contractor. We have to agree on a price where I consider it better to
own the new comfort system than to keep the money it costs]{.underline}.
Likewise, the contractor considers it better to take the money paid than
to keep the equipment in inventory (or pick it up from the supply house)
and perform the installation. [We have to voluntarily cooperate and
agree on the price.]{.underline}

[Next, the contractor must elicit the labor of his employees to perform
the installation, in return for compensation. Then, he must cooperate
with the supply house or distributor regarding the purchase of the
material and equipment.]{.underline} The distributor must buy it in turn
from a manufacturer who builds the equipment as the outcome of thousands
of acts of cooperation upstream.

An excellent video describing the cooperation that results from free
markets and capitalism is I Pencil: The Movie, based on the essay by
Leonard E. Read. Take a few minutes to watch it.

[[Statism denies cooperation. **Central planners make decisions that are
forced on people**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Statists eschew cooperation
because left on their own, [people make decisions the statists disagree
with]{.underline}. An example is the imposition of any type of wage and
price controls like the minimum wage.

[If you want to hire a high school student for a few hours after school
to clean your shop and help stock your trucks at the end of the day, you
and the high school student should be able to agree amongst yourselves
on the right compensation.]{.underline} Because the high school student
hasn't learned good work habits, has no experience, and will require
close supervision, you may decide that the student is not worth the
required minimum. [Because the [state forces you to]{.mark} [pay more
than you can justify]{.mark}, you must find another way to get the work
done and the student is denied both pocket money and the more valuable
work experience that will lead to greater pay in the
future.]{.underline}

[[Cooperation is more moral than force]{.mark}. Capitalism is again, the
more moral economic system]{.underline}.

[Capitalism is More Optimistic]{.underline}

[[Capitalists]{.mark} live in a [world of opportunity]{.mark}. They
constantly survey the landscape looking for possibilities to gain, to
build, to expand, to create]{.underline}. [[Statists]{.mark}, on the
other hand, [focus on scarcity]{.mark}]{.underline}. They see a world of
limited resources, which gives them reason to ration and allocate.

[What the **[statists overlook]{.mark} is the unlimited [power of human
ingenuity]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Time and time again, statists have
predicted the world would be unable to feed itself. Yet, [agricultural
[innovations result in more]{.mark} food [production on the same or
less]{.mark} land.]{.underline} Statists scared the public with peak oil
and limited fossil fuels, yet thinks to the combination of horizontal
drilling and fracking, the U.S. alone sits on a 200 year supply of oil.

[[There i]{.mark}s a [moral aspect]{.mark} in play. [Focusing on
limits]{.mark} and living within them [becomes a self-fulfilling
prophesy]{.mark}. The [statist suppresses man's hopes and
prospects]{.mark}. [Capitalism]{.mark} again, [is more
moral.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 1AR \-- Ext: Cap Good - Human Rights

#### Capitalism is the best and most inclusive system for promoting human rights

**Novak 15** \[Michael Novak, 3-23-2015, \"Capitalism Is the Most Moral
of a Bad Lot of Economic Systems,\" No Publication,
https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/06/25/has-capitalism-become-incompatible-with-christianity/capitalism-is-the-most-moral-of-a-bad-lot-of-economic-systems,
smarx, HHW\]

In answering the question, much depends on what you mean by
[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. I like the definition offered by Pope
John Paul II: \"[[an economic system which recognizes]{.mark} the
fundamental and positive [role of business]{.mark}, the market, [private
property and the resulting responsibility]{.mark} for the means of
production]{.underline}, as well as free human creativity in the
economic sector \... circumscribed within a strong juridical framework
which places it at the service of human freedom in its totality.\'\'

[[With]{.mark} a polity and [a culture that honor]{.mark} and promote
the [creativity and flourishing of humankind,]{.mark} **[capitalism is
the most moral of a bad lot of economic systems]{.mark} known to
humans**]{.underline}**.**

[First, **[no other system]{.mark} has [so quickly and]{.mark} so
[globally]{.mark} [lifted the poor out of
poverty]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If you look at a chart of population and
income since the beginning of the Christian era, the [line of growth is
nearly flat for 18 centuries, and then with the introduction of
invention and discovery it shoots upward.]{.underline}

[Second, [no other system]{.mark} has so deeply [grasped]{.mark} that
the [cause of the wealth]{.mark} of nations [is]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
John Paul II said, "[the possession of know-how, technology and skill,"
"[discipline]{.mark}d [and creative]{.mark} human [work]{.mark} and, as
an essential part of that work, initiative and entrepreneurial
ability."]{.underline}

[Third, [no other system]{.mark} has so [depended]{.mark} both [on
law]{.mark} -- to set clear rules and to protect and guide liberty --
[and on moral virtues]{.mark}, a concrete [vision of how to
improve]{.mark} the [common good by]{.mark} discovery and
[invention]{.mark}. It **[requires]{.mark} the [willingness to make
sacrifices for gains only future generations will see]{.mark},** [to
persist]{.mark} [through]{.mark} many [setbacks and]{.mark} to
[surrender]{.mark} many [pleasures]{.mark} in exchange for disciplined,
self-adapting work.]{.underline}

[Fourth, in the two centuries [since]{.mark} the birth of
[capitalism]{.mark} the [average life expectancy]{.mark} has
[risen]{.mark} from 26 to 67. [Earth]{.mark} is [teeming with]{.mark}
human [life]{.mark} as never before]{.underline}. In 1800, there were
fewer than one billion humans on the planet; today there are over seven
billion. In at least that sense, **[[capitalism]{.mark} has [vastly
expanded]{.mark} the [domain of life.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[Pope Francis decries an "economy of exclusion." Similarly, John Paul II
emphasized the moral [obligation to include every]{.mark} [woman and man
in]{.mark} "the [circle of development]{.mark}."]{.underline} To include
all of the forgotten people of Latin America (let alone Africa and
Asia), some 20 million new small businesses need to be formed, each
employing three to six workers at decent wages. [In [many
jurisdictions]{.mark} this would mean changing laws, to [allow]{.mark}
new small [businesses to be registered]{.mark} at minimal
cost]{.underline} and without the need to pay bribes to officials. It
would also mean building new organizations to specialize in micro-loans
for small businesses -- and also in providing practical advice so that
new businesses more easily succeed.

[[Nearly]{.mark} the [whole world]{.mark} is much in [favor]{.mark} of
this [inclusion]{.mark}. [No one should be excluded]{.mark} from the
global circle of development.]{.underline}

#### [Cap good]{.underline} -- the way society is structured enables us to harness capitalist endeavors for the benefit of everyone

**Boix 19** \[Carles Boix, American political scientist specializing in
comparative politics, currently teaching at Princeton University, 2019,
[Democratic Capitalism At The Crossroads: Technological Change And The
Future Of Politics]{.underline},\" Princeton University Press, SMarx,
JTong\]

In this book, I take a different approach. [**[The consequences
of]{.underline}** **[today's technological
changes]{.underline}**]{.mark}, I will claim, **[are not set in
stone]{.underline}**. They will work their way into the economy through
their direct (although, at this point, still uncertain) impact on the
demand for different types of labor and on the cost and ownership of
capital. Yet **[they will]{.underline}** also **[[depend on the
institutional and political strategies we follow]{.mark} in response to
those technological transformations.]{.underline}** During the last two
hundred years, in their quest for profits and wealth, the entrepreneurs
and industrial captains of modern capitalism have always pushed for the
rationalization and automation of production. That "process of
industrial mutation", to employ Schumpeter's renowned words,
"incessantly revolutionize\[d\] the economic structure from within,
incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new
one"---modifying the relationship between capital and labor, the
patterns of employment, and the distribution of income over time
(Schumpeter 1950, 83). In doing so, it periodically generated a
(changing) number of critical political challenges that were then met
with a particular set of policy responses. The same logic applies to
today's technological innovations. Because they have already heightened
economic inequality and may result in an even more extensive
robotization of substantial numbers of (low- and semiskilled) jobs, they
could put an end to the broad social consensus around democracy and
capitalism that prevailed during most of the twentieth
century---particularly in the advanced world. **[[That does not]{.mark}
necessarily [mean]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, that they will---and
**[that [they will make us travel back in time to the nineteenth
century]{.mark}]{.underline}**, when the industrial capitalism invented
in Manchester and its cotton factories turned out to be incompatible
with the construction of fully democratic institutions. **[[The reason
is simple]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The growing economic and political
tensions we are witnessing today are happening in very affluent
societies]{.mark}: their average per capita incomes are more than ten
times higher than at the beginning of the first Industrial Revolution.
[So much wealth, jointly with the presence of stable democratic
institutions and relatively well structured bureaucracies, should give
us much more maneuvering room]{.mark} than any generations before us
ever had [to respond to the technological and economic challenges of
today]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Therefore**[, [the task ahead of us is to
think about how to harness those economic and institutional assets to
the advantage of the many]{.mark}.]{.underline}** With that goal in
mind, **[[we should understand]{.underline}]{.mark}**, first, **[how
[tech]{.mark}nology [has shaped capitalism]{.mark} and, second, when and
how the latter has coexisted]{.underline}**, sometimes in a delicate,
uneasy balance, with democracy. I explain this, necessarily in a sketchy
manner, in this introduction by describing how modern capitalism has
evolved in terms of its structure of production (i.e., the level of
automation and the role of labor) and its relationship to
politics---from the first Industrial Revolution born in Manchester
through the twentiethcentury capitalism invented in Detroit's assembly
plants up to the new information era that emerged in Silicon Valley. In
the rest of the book, I develop that argument more extensively, mainly
focusing on the nature of twentieth-century democratic capitalism and,
above all, on the challenges and opportunities brought about by today's
technological revolution.

### 2AC \-- Turn: Cap Good - Inequality

#### Capitalism and the free-market have created today's prosperity

**Kim, 18**, Anthony Kim, Anthony B. Kim researches international
economic issues at The Heritage Foundation, with a focus on economic
freedom and free trade, 8/22/2018, "Communicating Capitalism to the Next
Generation",
<https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/communicating-capitalism-the-next-generation> -
FT

He couldn't be more right. **[[Prosperity has not arisen from]{.mark}
the beneficence of [some good king or a]{.mark} benign technocracy of
[experts]{.mark}, [let alone socialism]{.mark}. Rather, [it is the
result of]{.mark} the [hard work and innovative]{.mark}
[entrepreneurship]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[of those who have demanded
and exercised the fundamental freedom to decide for themselves how to
live their lives [under free market capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[[The free-market capitalist system, whose growth is]{.mark} so [well
documented]{.mark} in The Heritage Foundation's [Index of Economic
Freedom](http://www.heritage.org/index), [has empowered]{.mark}
[countless individuals]{.mark} around the world [by giving them more
choices and opportunities]{.mark}. Reforms]{.underline}** that enhance
economic freedom have **[enabled [hundreds of millions]{.mark} to
[escape poverty]{.mark} and [countless others]{.mark} to [enjoy]{.mark}
levels of [prosperity never before seen]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Capitalism has led to increased wages and increased longevity over the past century.

**Rubin '16** \[Jennifer Rubin; ; 5-24-2016; Opinion: Things have never
been better?; Washington Post;
https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/05/24/things-have-never-been-better/;
SK\]

Bombarded by negative news stories (is there any other kind?) and a
reprehensible presidential campaign, it is, to put it mildly, easy to
lose perspective. **[Two [data points]{.mark} should [give]{.mark} us
plenty of perspective --- and [cause for
optimism]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

First, Deirdre McCloskey writes:

**[[Two centuries ago]{.mark}, the [average world income]{.mark} per
human (in present-day prices) [was]{.mark} about [\$3 a
day]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It had been so since we lived in caves.
**[[Now]{.mark} it is [\$33 a day]{.mark}---which is Brazil's current
level and the level of the U.S. in 1940.]{.underline}** Over the past
200 years, the **[average real [income per person]{.mark}---including
even such present-day tragedies as Chad and North Korea---has [grown by
a factor of 10]{.mark}. It is stunning. [In countries that adopted trade
and economic betterment]{.mark} wholeheartedly, [like]{.mark} Japan,
Sweden and the [U.S]{.mark}., it is [more like]{.mark} a factor of
[30]{.mark}---even more stunning.]{.underline}**

**[A second data point]{.underline}**, not unrelated to the first, comes
from the **[World Health Organization's new report on
longevity:]{.underline}**

**[[Life expectancy increased by 5 years]{.mark} between 2000 and 2015,
the [fastest]{.mark} increase [since]{.mark} the [1960s]{.mark}. Those
gains reverse declines during the 1990s]{.underline}**, when life
expectancy fell in Africa because of the AIDS epidemic and in Eastern
Europe following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The **[increase was
greatest in the African Region of WHO]{.underline}** where life
expectancy increased by 9.4 years to 60 years, **[[driven]{.mark} mainly
[by improvements in child survival]{.mark}]{.underline}**, progress in
malaria control and expanded access to antiretrovirals for treatment of
HIV. . . .

**[Global life expectancy for children born in 2015 was 71.4
years]{.underline}** (73.8 years for females and 69.1 years for males),
but an individual child's outlook depends on where he or she is born.
The report shows that newborns in 29 countries -- all of them
high-income --- have an average life expectancy of 80 years or more,
while newborns in 22 others -- all of them in sub-Saharan Africa ---
have life expectancy of less than 60 years.

No one is saying poverty has been eradicated or that great challenges
and inequality do not exist. (The bottom five countries in life
expectancy are all in sub-Saharan Africa.) Shockingly, 5.9 million
children still die before their fifth birthday, for example.
Nevertheless, it helps to remember that the **[planet's [population on
average]{.mark} has [never been richer or lived
longer]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

McClosky posits that it is the **[[success and spread of
"'liberalism]{.mark},' in its original meaning of 'worthy of a free
person,'" that is [responsible for]{.mark} this unprecedented
[explosion]{.mark} in wealth]{.underline}**, which in turn can be put to
good uses such as reducing child mortality. This is what the American
Enterprise Institute's Arthur Brooks calls the moral case for
capitalism: **[It has helped [bring a billion people out of
poverty]{.mark} and is [helping]{.mark} the [world be healthier]{.mark}
and, yes, happier.]{.underline}** (It's hard to be happy when weighed
down by poverty and/or illness.)

We'd be remiss, however, if we did not acknowledge that wealth creation
alone does not automatically result in healthier and richer people
around the globe. It takes both public efforts such as George W. Bush's
President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief, which has saved millions of
lives, and private efforts such as those of the Gates Foundation, which
invests in "vaccines to prevent infectious diseases---including HIV,
polio, and malaria---and support\[s\] the development of integrated
health solutions for family planning, nutrition, and maternal and child
health."

**[Small-L [liberalism]{.mark} that helps [produce wealth]{.mark} (for
the United States as a whole and Bill and Melinda Gates personally) [and
values in support of human dignity]{.mark} underwrite the phenomenal
advances we see]{.underline}**. We should be wary of demagogues who
would dismantle or severely hinder the economic system that creates such
prosperity (yes, we are talking to you, Bernie Sanders) or who trash
U.S. global leadership and small-D democratic values (as Donald Trump
does). Perhaps **[if more people understood the historic gains made in
just this past generation, they'd be less inclined to tear down the
architecture that produced such progress.]{.underline}**

#### Cap good -- benefits democracy and uplifts the poor

**Mccloskey 19** \[Mccloskey, Deirdre Nansen, Distinguished Professor of
Economics, History, English, and Communication at the University of
Illinois, 2019, \"Why Liberalism Works : How True Liberal Values Produce
A Freer, More Equal, Prosperous World For All.,\" Yale University Press,
SMarx, JTong\]

And it came to pass. What I call the Great Enrichment is the chief sci-
entific finding of economic history. [**[The poorest people in the
developed econ- omies]{.underline}** **[and billions in the poor
countries]{.underline}** **[have been the biggest beneficiaries
of]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[liberal economic
[growth]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[The rich became
richer]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, true. [But the poor have gas heating,
cars, smallpox vaccinations, indoor plumbing, cheap travel, rights for
women, low child mortality, adequate nutrition, taller bodies, doubled
life expectancy, schooling for their kids, newspapers, a vote, a shot at
uni- versity, and respect]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Never had anything
remotely similar happened, not in the glory of Greece or the grandeur of
Rome, not in ancient Egypt or medi- eval China. **[Yet [you will have
heard]{.mark} recently that [our biggest problem is inequality,
and]{.mark} that [we must make men and women all
equal]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[No, we should
not]{.underline}**]{.mark}---at least, not **[[if we want to lift up the
poor]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Ethically speaking, the true liberal should
care chiefly about whether **[[the poorest among us are moving closer to
having enough to live with dignity and to participate in a
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They are. Even in already rich
countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, **[[the
real income of the poor has]{.underline}]{.mark}** recently
**[[risen]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not, as one hears daily,
stagnated---if, that is, income is correctly measured to include better
health care, better working conditions, more years of education, longer
years of retirements, and, above all, the rising quality of goods and
services---better autos and better medicine. Admittedly it is rising at
a slower pace than in the 1950s. But that era of rising prosperity was a
catch-up from the wretched set- backs of the Great Depression and the
War.

### 1AR \-- Ext: Cap Good - Inequality

#### No impact -- the negative effects of capitalism are over-hyped by the media

**Stossel 21** \[John Stossel, 6-16-2021, \"People Love To Criticize
Capitalism. Here\'s Why They\'re Wrong.,\" Reason,
https://reason.com/2021/06/16/people-love-to-criticize-capitalism-heres-why-theyre-wrong/,
SMarx, JTong\]

Everywhere, **[[people trash capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[But]{.mark} **[what [they]{.mark} [think]{.mark} they know about
capitalism [is]{.mark}]{.underline}** usually
**[[wrong]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

My new video debunks some myths about capitalism.

\"No one ever makes a billion dollars,\" complains Rep. Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez (D--N.Y.). \"You take a billion dollars.\" In other words,
**[[capitalists get rich by taking money from
others]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[[That\'s nonsense]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and Myth Number One.

**[[People believe that myth if they think that when one person wins,
someone else must lose.]{.mark} [It\'s]{.mark} [natural]{.mark} to
believe that]{.underline}** **[[if]{.underline}]{.mark}** you think
**[[there is a finite amount of money in the world. But there
isn\'t]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[**[Free markets increase total wealt]{.underline}**h]{.mark}.
**[Competition encourages entrepreneurs to find new ways to release more
value from both people and resources.]{.underline}**

**[[Because]{.mark} [capitalism is voluntary]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
consumers have choices, **[[the only way capitalists can get rich is to
offer us something]{.mark} that we believe is [better]{.mark} than we
had before.]{.underline}**

That creates new wealth.

**[[Steve]{.mark} [Jobs]{.mark} became a billionaire]{.underline}**. But
by creating Apple, **[he [gave us]{.mark} more: [millions of jobs and
billions of dollars]{.mark} added [to our
economy.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Research shows that **[[entrepreneurs only keep 2.2 percent of the
additional wealth they generate]{.underline}]{.mark}**. \"In other
words, **[[the rest of us captured]{.mark} almost [98]{.mark}
[percent]{.mark} of the benefits]{.underline}**,\" says economist Dan
Mitchell of the Center for Freedom and Prosperity.

\"**[I hope that we get 100 [new]{.mark}]{.underline}** super
**[[billionaires]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" he adds, \"**[Because that
[means]{.mark} 100 [new people have]{.mark} figured out [ways to
make]{.mark} the rest of [our lives better off.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}**

But former Labor Secretary Robert Reich says we should \"abolish
billionaires.\" He wants some form of wealth tax to hold their wealth
down. \"Entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos would be just as motivated by
\$100 million or even \$50 million,\" Reich claims.

But Mitchell points out that **[[if their income is limited,]{.mark}
\"maybe [they]{.mark} just [take it
easy...retire]{.mark}]{.underline}**...sail a yacht around the
world...**[[consuming instead of saving and
producing.\"]{.underline}]{.mark}**

I want them saving and producing! **[[Billionaires]{.mark} have shown
that they\'[re]{.mark} [good at cutting prices or improving products or
both]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

As Michell puts it, \"I\'m not giving Jeff Bezos any money unless he\'s
selling me something that I value more than that money.\"

Even if they don\'t---even if they run out of ideas---[**[their wealth
is useful]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

One reader called me \"a complete moron\" for saying that. He argues
that \"more money in the richest hands means money sitting in the bank
doing nothing.\"

But that\'s an ignorant view of banks. **[[Because banks loan that money
out, they enable]{.mark} other [people]{.mark} [to buy homes, start new
businesses, and get educated.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Still, I hear that \"**[[the rich are getting richer, while the poor get
poorer]{.underline}]{.mark}**!\"

**[[That\'s Myth Number Two.]{.mark} [Yes, the rich got lots richer, but
the poor and middle class got richer, too.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

\"The economic pie grows,\" says Mitchell. \"**[[We are much richer than
our grandparents, and our grandparents were much richer than their

They are right about one thing: the rich are becoming richer. There are
now nearly 19 million millionaires in America, two-fifths of all the
millionaires in the world. **[[We have 621 billionaires]{.mark},
one-fourth of all the billionaires globally.]{.underline}** They are
rich because the United States rewards the entrepreneurial spirit.
American capitalism has also produced the largest and most affluent
middle class in the world, with a per capita GDP of more than \$65,000.
By contrast, Communist China's per capita GDP is an estimated \$10,900,
one-sixth of ours. **[But it is also true that [the poor are getting
richer]{.mark}. Measured by consumption, according to economist Bruce
Meyer of the University of Notre Dame, [the [percentage of]{.mark} the
[poor]{.mark}](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/annual-report-on-us-consumption-poverty-2018/)
[fell]{.mark} [from 13 percent]{.mark} in 1980 [to 2.9 percent]{.mark}
in 2018,]{.underline}** while the official poverty rate fell by only 1.2
percentage points to 12.3 percent. A major reason for the discrepancy is
that the official poverty measure is based on cash income only, which
fails to include all the resources available to a family including tax
credits and in-kind transfers. **[The reality is that [the average
"poor" American owns a car]{.mark}, enjoys air conditioning,
[has]{.mark} access to the [Internet]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [has]{.mark}
at least one [TV]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The official poverty line for a
family of four is \$25,465. Capitalism benefits all, as seen by the
lessening of historical racial and gender disparities. From 2013-2018,
**[the five metropolitan [areas with the largest black
population]{.mark}---New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and Washington,
D.C.---[saw black median household income increase significantly]{.mark}
from rates of 7 percent in Washington, D.C., to 21 percent in
Atlanta.]{.underline}** In 2019, blacks maintained their lowest
unemployment rate ever of 5.5 percent. The jobless rate for Hispanics
hit a record low of 3.9 percent. **[The 11.6 million
[women]{.mark}-[owned firms]{.mark} in America [represent 39 percent
of]{.mark} all [private businesses]{.mark}. [No]{.mark} [other nation

Abstract [This paper investigates an aspect of the question of whether
capitalism can be defended as a morally legitimate economic system by
asking whether [capitalism serves progressive, feminist ends of freedom
and gender equality]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} I argue that although
capitalism is subject to critique for increasing economic inequality,
[[it can be seen to decrease gender inequality, particularly in
traditional societies. Capitalism brings technological and social
innovations that are good for women, and disrupts traditions that
subordinate women in materially beneficial and socially progressive
ways. Capitalism upholds the ideology of individual rights and the ideal
of mutual advantage]{.mark}.]{.underline} By institutionalizing mutual
advantage through the logic of voluntary exchange, progressive
capitalism promotes the idea that no one is to be expected to sacrifice
their interests with no expectation of benefit. [[Thus capitalism
opposes the traditional, sexist ideal of womanly
self-sacrifice.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### 1AR -- Ext: Cap Good - Gender

#### Cap is good for women -- innovation and destruction of norms 

**Cudd**, 20**15** (Ann, American philosopher. "Is Capitalism Good for

///MF)

In a recent book (Cudd and Holmstrom 2011), I argued that capitalism has
brought about great changes in the quality and length of human life in
the twentieth century: the income takeoff (the vast increase of per
capita income of developed nations), the health transition (raising the
life expectancy by upwards of 50 years), and the fertility transition
(from an average of 6 children per woman to around 2). In this paper, I
delve further into the question of whether [[capitalism is good for
women]{.underline}]{.mark}. A major problem with capitalism is that it
increases inequality, which is especially harmful to women and other
vulnerable groups. Capitalism increases economic inequality in the first
instance, but this in turn tends to create political and social
inequalities. Inequality, I agree, needs to be controlled if capitalism
is to be progressive and defensible. I defend such a controlled
capitalism in two ways that are particularly relevant to feminism as a
progressive social movement for human freedom. [First, [capitalism
promotes innovation: it promotes technical innovation that tends to
improve quality and length of life for everyone, but particularly for
women.]{.mark} But more importantly for the feminist defense of
capitalism[, it promotes social innovation, in particular the
destruction of harmful, patriarchal traditions. Thus, the second defense
I will make of capitalism is that it opposes tradition fetishism and
reduces the oppression of traditional societies that impose hierarchies
of gender and case.]{.mark}]{.underline}

So **[Milanovic's dichotomy between 'liberal democracy' and 'political
capitalism' seems false]{.underline}**. And it arises because, of
course, Milanovic starts with his premise (unproven) that [a**[n
alternative mode of production]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and social
system, namely socialism, [is ruled out forever]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
In Global Inequality, **[Milanovic concluded]{.underline}** that **[the
idea of a united global proletariat making a worldwide revolution is out
of [the]{.mark} door because]{.underline}** now the
**[[real]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[inequalities are between Americans
and Africans]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not between capitalists and workers
everywhere. Trotsky's international proletarian revolution is out of
date: "This was the idea behind Trotsky's "permanent revolution".
**[[There were no national contradictions]{.mark}, just a worldwide
class contradiction.]{.underline}** But **[if the world's actual
situation is such that the greatest disparities are due to the income
gaps between nations, then proletarian solidarity doesn't make much
sense. [Proletarian solidarity is]{.mark} then simply [dead]{.mark}
because there is no longer such a thing as global proletariat. This is
why ours is a distinctly non-Marxian world.]{.underline}**" And yet the
working class, both industrial workers and those in so-called 'service'
industries, has never been larger in human history. **[Globally, there
were 2.2bn people at work and producing value back in 1991. Now there
are 3.2bn.]{.underline}** The global workforce has risen by 1bn in the
last 20 years. **[Global]{.underline}**ly, the **[industrial workforce
has risen by 46% since 1991 from 490m to 715m in 2012 and will reach
well over 800m]{.underline}** before the end of the decade. Indeed, the
industrial workforce has grown by 1.8% a year since 1991 and since 2004
by 2.7% a year, which is now a faster rate of growth than the services
sector (2.6% a year)! Globally, the share of industrial workers in the
total workforce has risen slightly from 22% to 23%. **[Capitalism is not
alone; it has a gravedigger, the proletariat]{.underline}**. Milanovic
dismisses this. In his new book**[, "I do believe, to a large extent,
\[[capitalism\] is sustainable]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Even if all of
inequality continue\[s\] to be the way that \[it is\], unchecked. **[[It
is sustainable]{.mark}, largely, [because we don't have a blueprint for
an alternative]{.mark} system.]{.underline}** However, something being
sustainable, something being efficient, something being good, are two
different things." **[[Milanovic]{.mark} does not like capitalism, but
to use Margaret Thatcher's phrase in referring to her neoliberal
policies for capitalism: he [reckons there is no alternative]{.mark}
(TINA). So the aim must be, just as Keynes argued in the 1930s: "to make
capitalism more sustainable]{.underline}**. And that's exactly what I
think we should do now". The trouble is that Milanovic's policies to
reduce the inequality of wealth and income in capitalist economies
and/or allow people to leave their countries of poverty for a better
world seem to be just as (if not more) 'utopian' a future under
capitalism than the 'socialist utopia' he rules out.

[We really need to problematize [the assumption that there is such a

the traditional style of the socialist movement today is that for most
working-class people, "holistically" speaking, they only care about now
and me,]{.underline} because to them, "in the long run we will all be
dead." [[Workers all over the world have never united and will probably
never do so]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Colonial historical evidence shows
that in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, workers
and laborers were among the fiercest opponents of poor Chinese
migrants.]{.underline} Take the example of Australia during the
nineteenth century[. It was [workers and trade union activists who
opposed Chinese settlers on the grounds that the Chinese coolies'
willingness to work for lower wages was an obstacle to the creation of
an equal society]{.mark}.]{.underline} This ideology fits well with the
then prevalent social Darwinism and the Yellow Peril paranoia. Thus the
first act of the Australian federation in 1901, the first
nation-building act of the first parliament, was an immigration
exclusion act against the colored races[. This act, in the name of
democracy and equality (everyone is equal but some are more equal than
others) [pushed forward the White Australian policy that remained in
full force until the 1960s]{.mark}]{.underline}. To avoid any
misunderstanding, let me state categorically that I have no problems
with Hart-Landsberg and Burkett's criticisms of China's development and
growth model. My concern is that we may be barking up the wrong tree.
[China's development and growth model has to be examined within the
international context of the Western dominance of material wealth and
lifestyle.]{.underline} For one and a half centuries, the Chinese have
been seeking the secret of making China as wealthy as a Western country
and of living the lifestyle of a Westerner. They tried Gao / China
Roundtable 471 democracies (though only briefly), and they tried what
they understood to be socialism (for thirty years).

#### Opposition comes from inside the movement

**Tooze**, 20**21** (Adam, PhD, LPE@Columbia, Ecological Leninism Adam
Tooze on Andreas Malm's post-pandemic climate politics 11-18.
[https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n22/adam-tooze/ecological-leninism
///](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n22/adam-tooze/ecological-leninism%20///)MF)

[But, as Malm points out, the climate movement's appropriation of
history has been one-sided. How can one treat the suffragette movement
seriously without emphasising its use of direct action and sabotage?
Even more grotesque is the representation of the abolition of slavery as
if it were achieved through the high moralism of Quaker 'NGOs', rather
than slave rebellion or the radical example of militant
abolitionists.]{.underline}

[[By ruling out direct action, the climate movement robs itself, in
Malm's view, of its only serious means of leverage]{.mark}. What's
needed, he argues, is not the slow shift of public opinion and electoral
results, but a more encompassing 'theory of change':]{.underline}

[Here is what this movement of millions should do, for a start: announce
and enforce the prohibition. Damage and destroy new CO2-emitting
devices. Put them out of commission, pick them apart, demolish them,
burn them, blow them up. Let the capitalists who keep on investing in
the fire know that their properties will be trashed. 'We are the
investment risk,' runs a slogan from Ende Gelände, but the risk clearly
needs to be higher than one or two days of interrupted production per
year. 'If we can't get a serious carbon tax from a corrupted Congress,
we can impose a de facto one with our bodies,' Bill McKibben has argued,
but a carbon tax is so 2004. If we can't get a prohibition, we can
impose a de facto one with our bodies and any other means
necessary.]{.underline}

[[Malm is aware that such tactics risk alienating support, inviting
media denunciation and provoking massive repression. As he admits,
'climate militancy would have to be articulated to a wider
anti-capitalist groundswell]{.mark}, much as in earlier shifts of modes
of production, when physical attacks on ruling classes formed only minor
parts of society-wide reorganisation. How could that happen? This cannot
be known beforehand. It can be found only through immersion in
practice.' These are the words of a revolutionary cadre hedging his
bets.]{.underline}

Given how remote the goal of comprehensive decarbonisation is, it is
less the aim than the manner of politics that matters. Given the reality
of the underlying conflict, division and strife are not to be regretted,
but embraced -- an essential Leninist lesson. To adopt an antagonistic
stance is to do no more than respond adequately to the situation. As
Malm and the collective conclude in White Skin, Black Fuel, 'if nothing
else, the anti-climate politics of the far right should shatter any
remaining illusion that fossil fuels can be relinquished through some
kind of smooth, reasoned transition \... A transition will happen
through intense polarisation and confrontation, or it will not happen at
all.' From this point of view, the question isn't whether liberal
activists do or don't want to engage in sabotage. If we keep to our
current course, sabotage is coming. If it isn't directed from the top,
it will bubble up from below. The question is whether the mainstream
climate movement can ready itself for the agonising dilemmas to come.
Can it sustain its coherence and momentum in the face of crisis,
violence, division and, quite likely, defeat?

It is at this point that the dramas of 20th-century European history
return to haunt Malm's vision of the future -- not as an inspiration to
revolution, but as a way of giving meaning to resistance that may
ultimately be in vain. Imagine that we are no longer in the world of
school strikes and UN conferences. Imagine that, after the melting of
the ice caps and a dramatic civilisational collapse, a huddle of people
are eking out an existence in northern latitudes. What will they tell
their children about the disaster? Will they say that 'humanity brought
about the end of the world in perfect harmony? That everyone willingly
queued up for the furnaces? Or that some people fought like Jews who
knew they would be killed?'

The 'Jews' Malm evokes are the resistance fighters of the Warsaw ghetto
and the camps who engaged in heroic but doomed uprisings against the
Nazis. And he means this extraordinary analogy seriously: 'If it is too
late for resistance to be waged within a calculus of immediate utility,
the time has come for it to vindicate the fundamental values of life,
even if it only means crying out to the heavens.' He cites Alain Brossat
and Sylvie Klingberg's Revolutionary Yiddishland: 'Their combat was for
history, for memory \... This affirmation of life by way of sacrifice
and combat with no prospect of victory is a tragic paradox that can only
be understood as an act of faith in history.' 'Better to die blowing up
a pipeline,' Malm concludes, 'than to burn impassively.' Thus the image
of blowing up a pipeline returns, not now as an act of sabotage but one
of self-sacrifice. At this intersection of a monumental past and a dark
future, we reach a dead end.

#### Movements fail

Tooze on Andreas Malm's post-pandemic climate politics 11-18.

///](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n22/adam-tooze/ecological-leninism%20///)MF)

Earlier in How to Blow up a Pipeline, Malm gestures at an alternative.
Imagine, he writes, that the mass mobilisations of the latest cycle of
protest become impossible to ignore.

The ruling classes feel themselves under such heat -- perhaps their
hearts even melting somewhat at the sight of all these kids with
handwritten placards -- that their obduracy wanes. [New politicians are
voted into office, notably from green parties in Europe, who live up to
their election promises. The pressure is kept up from
below.]{.underline} Moratoriums on fresh fossil fuel infrastructure are
instituted. Germany initiates immediate phase-out of coal production,
the Netherlands likewise for gas, Norway for oil, the US for all of the
above; legislation and planning are put in place for cutting emissions
by at least 10 per cent per year; renewable energy and public transport
are scaled up, plant-based diets promoted, blanket bans on fossil fuels
prepared.

[If this were to transpire, Malm concedes, '[the movement should be
given the chance to see this scenario through.']{.mark}]{.underline}

[The majority of climate activists put their hope in this reformist
vision: we should indeed hold on to it. [But let us also admit that
although those lines were printed only months ago, they already seem out
of]{.mark} date. And Malm soon provides us with a vision much closer to
the way the world looks today. [Imagine that 'a few years down the road,
the kids of the Thunberg generation and the rest of us wake up one
morning and realise that business-as-usual is still on, regardless of
all the strikes, the science, the pleas, the millions with colourful
outfits and banners \... What do we do then?']{.mark}]{.underline}

The centrist will counsel patience. Anything we can actually do, we can
afford, Keynes said. By the same token, he added in a radio talk
delivered in the spring of 1942, we can afford anything we can actually
do, provided we remain patient and take the necessary time. That is a
telling qualification. As Malm remarks, it is a fundamental assumption
of social democracy that it has history and time on its side. But to
imagine that is still the case, to talk as if we can safely distinguish
between the short, medium and long term, is one of the most insidious
forms of soft denial at work today. We should no longer indulge in it.

As Malm points out, neoliberalism has repeatedly found ways of jumping
over its own shadow to meet a crisis at the scale and pace demanded by
the situation. The response to the pandemic has provided just such a
demonstration of flexibility. But trusting to that kind of politics when
it comes to climate change is a recipe for planetary disaster. Malm
forces us to face a crucial question: what are the social democratic
politics of emergency? If his version of ecological Leninism is to be
refused, what is our logic of action in the face of disaster? What are
our political options when there is every reason to think that we have
very little time left? As Daniel Bensaïd reminds us, in an essay quoted
by Malm, in 1914 Lenin made a note in the margins of Hegel's The Science
of Logic: 'Breaks in gradualness \... Gradualness explains nothing
without leaps. Leaps! Leaps! Leaps!'

#### No spill-up, individuals don't have enough power

**T**rotskyist **F**raction, 20**19** ("Capitalism Is Destroying the
Planet -- Let's Destroy Capitalism!" September 15, 2019.
<https://www.leftvoice.org/capitalism-is-destroying-the-planet-lets-destroy-capitalism/>
/// MF)

In broad sectors of the movement, the dominant logic is that the key to
solving the ecological crisis is changes in individual consumption,
focusing their attention on "irresponsible consumption." Obviously,
capitalist production, which generates consumption cycles that span the
globe, molds "consumers." [[In this way, individual human behavior
contributes to the ecological crisis, and it is desirable to encourage
new forms of consumption by creating environmental
consciousness.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Yet changing individual behavior often has only a negligible effect on
capitalism's environmental consequences. Its effect is, moreover, highly
unequal. An Oxfam report from 2015 showed that the richest 10% of the
planet causes half of CO2 emissions, while the poorest 50% (3.5 billion
people) is responsible for only 10%.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The logic of focusing the environmental movement on changes in
individual behavior implies two strategic problems. First, it encourages
an individualist conception,]{.mark} blurring or directly obscuring the
"center of gravity" that needs to be attacked, namely imperialist
capitalism, the big corporations and the capitalist states. Second, [it
strengthens the reactionary argument that "the people are responsible
for the crisis,"]{.mark} which leads to measures that force the working
class and the poorest sectors of society to pay for the environmental
crisis. This argument preserves the system and benefits the capitalists,
and it prevents the one social force that could confront capitalism from
joining the struggle.]{.underline}

One of the lessons provided by the Yellow Vest movement in France---an
immense social movement triggered by an increase in the gasoline
tax---is that the "ecological transition" cannot fall on the shoulders
of the working class and poor masses. In the context of the ecological
crisis, the central problem is not the "division" between those who
pollute and those who do not, but rather between the social majority
that is already paying the costs of the crisis and the capitalists that
caused it.

The only way to confront the global environmental crisis caused by
capitalism is for the majority of the population to join the struggle,
with the working class at the forefront. This is because the
contradiction between capital and labor is not just one of capitalism's
many contradictions; it is the contradiction that structures capitalism
itself. If the relationship between society and nature is mediated by
production, it is only by revolutionizing production that the metabolism
with nature can be rationally regulated. That is why the working class,
which is the only authentically productive class in society, can knit
together a social alliance that can pull the "emergency break" on the
coming disaster.

There are important examples of unity between the environmental movement
and sectors of the working class. That was the case with the Harland and
Wolff shipyard in Ireland, where the Titanic was built. That shipyard
was declared bankrupt, but the workers took over the plant demanding its
nationalization in order to produce clean energy. There have also been
calls by workers for the unions to call a climate strike, for example,
in Portugal, Germany and Spain.

These initiatives are extremely important. In an intuitive yet correct
way, they point to the "social subject" that can hegemonize the struggle
for an alternative to environmental destruction: the working class.

The need for the working class to join this movement with its own
demands and its own methods of struggle (strikes, blockades and pickets)
is vital for developing the movement. It is necessary to help break down
the prejudices that exist in wide sectors of the working class about the
environmental movement---prejudices often justified by policies
supposedly in "defense of the environment" that attack the working
class, equating it with the polluting bosses and worsening its living
conditions.

Above all, it is necessary to confront the reactionary role played by
the majority of the bureaucratized trade unions. Especially in the
sectors of heavy industry and energy, the union bureaucracies act as the
capitalists' best partners. Many times they oppose any measures for
ecological transition, however superficial they may be, under the slogan
of "saving jobs." What they are really saving is the capitalists'
profits, tying the destiny of the working class to the success of the
bosses.

Facing the Climate Strike, the unions in Europe and the United States
mostly oppose it---or in some cases, such as in Germany, they support it
demagogically while refusing to organize any actions that would
supposedly be "illegal." That is why, alongside the broadest
self-organization of the youth, it is necessary to denounce the
reactionary positions of the bureaucratic unions, which for decades have
ignored or played down ecological problems. We must demand that they
call a strike and put their organizations in the service of the struggle
against the capitalists responsible for the looming catastrophe that
threatens us all.

The declaration in Germany by a group of rank-and-file trade union
activists called [ver.di aktiv](http://verdi-aktiv.de/) (which is
supported by RIO, the Revolutionary Internationalist Organization) has
received more than 500 signatures from trade unionists across the
country and from different sectors. It demands that the large trade
unions call for a strike. This is a small but significant expression of
that policy.

### 1AR \-- Ext: Vagueness

#### Ecological Leninism is incredibly vague, the revolution is either global or nothing. 

**Tugal 20** -- \[Cihan Tugal PhD is a professor of sociology at the
University of California, Berkeley; "Leninism without the working class?

<https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/can-europe-make-it/leninism-without-the-working-class-the-missing-subject-in-malms-ecological-revolution/>;
Lowell-JL\]

Remarkably, Malm discusses factory takeovers without bringing workers
in. Oil companies indeed need to be nationalized, as he asserts, and
their resources turned into carbon capture facilities, machines, and
personnel. When capital does anything to approximate the carbon capture
which scientists argue is required at a global level, it circulates the
carbon back into the atmosphere. Not selling it would not be profitable,
Malm demonstrates: businesses will not produce something they would
afterwards have to sink into the ground. Only the state can sink carbon
into the ground globally. However, the book **[[does not include one
mention of organizing or mobilizing the workers of these companies to
carry out the necessary nationalizations]{.mark}. It appears that "[we"
are burdened with the nationalization]{.mark}. [But who is going to run
these]{.mark} companies after "we" nationalize them?]{.underline}**

Ironically, Malm introduces the section where he discusses oil
nationalization with an anti-bureaucracy, pro-democracy quote from
Lenin, yet comes to rely so much on the state as his prose unfolds.
**[[Without any articulation of the social actors who could take on
nationalization processes, the talk of democracy will be just
talk]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It might be objected that workers are so
complicit in pollutant capitalism that they can't be counted on. But
negating that option goes nowhere towards nailing down an effective
social replacement.

Then, there is the problem of the winter palace itself. Grabbing control
of a second rate empire granted the Bolsheviks the chance to start a
socialist experiment on a huge scale. But they knew everything would go
to ruin if their institutions did not spread beyond Russia. Malm is
incautiously sanguine that a revolutionary takeover might not produce
similar bottlenecks today. But he is unspecific regarding the
international form war communism will assume.

**[The [eco-revolution is either global or]{.mark} it is
[nothing]{.mark}, but h[ow do you accomplish global war
communism]{.mark} [in a world of a few imperial powers]{.mark}, perhaps
a dozen effective nation-states, and many state-like yet ineffective
entities?]{.underline}** How many of these would you have to storm to
even initiate a global process? **[[There can be no immediate

even if without any resolution.

[In many of these countries, something more turned out to be the
environment. Communism had a dismal record on the environment.11 By
1989, [sulfurous skies were killing people across the Soviet bloc.
Single Russian factories were producing more pollution than all of
Scandinavia.]{.mark}]{.underline}12 Immediately after the end of the
Soviet Union, [the [Russian Federation classified one sixth of its
territory as uninhabitable because of pollution]{.mark}---yet the
inhabitants had nowhere to go.]{.underline}13 Rivers were poisoned
beyond anything found in western countries,14 [while Lake Baikal had
become a paradigm of how not to manage a precious natural
resource.1]{.underline}5 [The Aral Sea, in Central Asia, had become the
prime example of "ecocide."]{.underline}16[Communism performed so
conspicuously poorly regarding the environment for six
reasons.]{.underline} First, [[Marxism carried forward the western
tradition of treating nature solely as providing resources for human
consumption.]{.underline}]{.mark} As Vaclav Havel explained, [Marxism
saw humans as the "productive force" and nature as a "production tool,"
destroying the necessarily intimate relationship between the
two.]{.underline}17 This concept was succinctly captured in the "labor
theory of value" that denied economic value to natural resources as such
when consumed in productive processes because no human labor was
expended in creating the natural resources.18 [A [second feature of
Marxism]{.mark} reinforced the effect of the labor theory of value---its
denial of individual responsibility.]{.underline} As a result, [[no one
felt responsibility for the natural environment,]{.underline}]{.mark}
leading to reckless disregard of environmental consequences.19 Thirdly,
[the socialist goal of "transforming the world" led easily to
"gigantomania"---a desire for the largest and most grandiose
technological feats]{.underline}.20 Gigantomania is also found in
western countries, but structural features of Communism prevented
effective counter-pressure that, at least sometimes, stopped some of the
most substantial. excesses in the west.21 [This introduces a fourth
factor---structural features rooted in Marxist ideology and the
conspiratorial nature of Communism's rise to power---that are perhaps
the most important]{.underline}. The "dictatorship of the proletariat"
brooked no countervailing power centers.22 [The [Communist obsession
with secrecy often kept problems hidden from both the public and the
central authorities until catastrophe made the problem obvious to
all]{.mark}.]{.underline}23 Fifth, the determination to keep
environmental problems secret was reinforced by the belief that such
problems could not arise under Communism, [which, after all, represented
the most progressive ordering of society and the economy; to admit to
environmental failings was to admit that Communism had failed in at
least one important respect]{.underline}.24 Finally, [t[here was the
importance of "fulfilling the plan]{.mark}."]{.underline} [Success and
promotion for officials---and [all major economic decisions were made by
official]{.mark}]{.underline}s--- [came only from fulfilling the
plan]{.underline}, whi[ch generally was measured solely through
[quantitative achievements, resulting in pervasive poor quality
production]{.mark}]{.underline}.25 New construction is what the plan
called for, not maintenance, while cost, in any rational sense, simply
was not a factor.26

#### Communism fails 

**Perry**, 20**16** (Mark, American economist and professor of economics
and finance at UoM-Flint "Why Socialism Always Fails" AEI March 22 2016.
<https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/why-socialism-always-fails/> ///MF)

Slightly more than 20 years, I wrote the article "[Why Socialism
Failed](http://fee.org/articles/why-socialism-failed/)" and it appeared
in 1995 in The Freeman, the flagship publication of the [Foundation for
Economic Education](http://fee.org/). I think it was the first essay or
op-ed I wrote for a general audience following graduation in 1993 from
George Mason University with a Ph.D. in economics. Note that the title
of the article ("failed") implied the past tense, as if I perhaps
assumed the failures of socialism were so apparent and obvious (I called
it the Big Lie of the 20th century) that it would be forever considered
only as a discredited system of the past, and never as a viable option
going forward into the future! Of course, at the time many parts of the
world were moving away from collectivism and central planning and
towards free market capitalism -- the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991,
the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, and China was opening up its economy
and re-established the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 1990, etc.

Given the recent resurgence of socialism, especially as it is now being
embraced by young Americans, I thought it might be a good time to
re-visit my 1995 essay to review why socialism: a) failed in the 20th
century, b) is failing in the 21st century (e.g. Venezuela, see photo
above), and c) will always fail. And that's because it's a flawed system
based on completely faulty principles that aren't consistent with human
behavior and can't nurture the human spirit.

Here's are some excerpts of my 1995 essay "Why Socialism Failed":

[1. [Socialism is the Big Lie of the twentieth century]{.mark}. While it
promised prosperity, equality, and security, [it delivered poverty,
misery, and tyranny.]{.mark} Equality was achieved only in the sense
that everyone was equal in his or her misery.]{.underline}

In the same way that a Ponzi scheme or chain letter initially succeeds
but eventually collapses, socialism may show early signs of success. But
any accomplishments quickly fade as the fundamental deficiencies of
central planning emerge. It is the initial illusion of success that give
government intervention its pernicious, seductive appeal. [[In the long
run, socialism has always proven to be a formula for tyranny and
misery.]{.underline}]{.mark}

A pyramid scheme is ultimately unsustainable because it is based on
faulty principles. Likewise, collectivism is unsustainable in the long
run because it is a flawed theory. [[Socialism does not work because it
is not consistent with fundamental principles of human behavior. The
failure of socialism in countries around the world can be traced to one
critical defect: it is a system that ignores
incentives.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In a capitalist economy, incentives are of the utmost importance. Market
prices, the profit-and-loss system of accounting, and private property
rights provide an efficient, interrelated system of incentives to guide
and direct economic behavior. Capitalism is based on the theory that
incentives matter!

Under socialism, incentives either play a minimal role or are ignored
totally. A centrally planned economy without market prices or profits,
where property is owned by the state, is a system without an effective
incentive mechanism to direct economic activity. By failing to emphasize
incentives, socialism is a theory inconsistent with human nature and is
therefore doomed to fail. Socialism is based on the theory that
incentives don't matter!

2\. The strength of capitalism can be attributed to an incentive
structure based upon the three Ps: (1) prices determined by market
forces, (2) a profit-and-loss system of accounting and (3) private
property rights. [The failure of socialism can be traced to its neglect
of these three incentive-enhancing components.]{.underline}

[3. By their failure to foster, promote, and nurture the potential of
their people through incentive-enhancing institutions, centrally planned
economies deprive the human spirit of full development. [Socialism fails
because it kills and destroys the human
spirit]{.mark}]{.underline}--just ask the people leaving Cuba in
homemade rafts and boats \[and those waiting in long lines today in
Venezuela struggling, and often failing, to buy food\].

[4. The temptress of socialism is constantly luring us with the offer:
"give up a little of your freedom and I will give you a little more
security." As the experience of this century has demonstrated, the
bargain is tempting but never pays off. [We end up losing both our
freedom and our security.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Socialism will remain a constant temptation. We must be vigilant in our
fight against socialism not only around the globe but also here in the
United States.

The failure of socialism inspired a worldwide renaissance of freedom and
liberty. For the first time in the history of the world, the day is
coming very soon when a majority of the people in the world will live in
free societies or societies rapidly moving toward freedom.

Capitalism will play a major role in the global revival of liberty and
prosperity because it nurtures the human spirit, inspires human
creativity, and promotes the spirit of enterprise. By providing a
powerful system of incentives that promote thrift, hard work, and
efficiency, capitalism creates wealth.

The main difference between capitalism and socialism is this: Capitalism
works.

[[To camouflage]{.mark} their [intent]{.mark},[ progressives speak of

[In truth, [Marx was wrong about]{.mark} nearly **[everything]{.mark}**.

**[There\'s a reason that Amazon gives plenty of space for customer

Well, if that\'s the case when it comes to books, stereos, refrigerators
and thousands of other items, **[shouldn\'t it also apply to something
as important as your form of government?]{.underline}**

I can\'t help but think about that whenever I read about some poll
indicating that a large number of Americans prefer socialism to
capitalism. To me, it begs the question: **[Do they really know the
\"product\" they\'re touting, or have they been fooled by some vapid
slogans?]{.underline}**

**[Take [Venezuela]{.mark}. I\'m curious, for example, how many of the
pro-socialism crowd are familiar with what\'s happened to that oil-rich
nation over the last two decades]{.underline}**.

Looking at **[it today - [plagued by empty store shelves, chronic
hyperinflation, widespread looting, and severe shortages of food and
medicine]{.mark} - you\'d never know that [before 1999]{.mark}, it was
one of the [wealthiest]{.mark} countries [in South
America]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When The Heritage Foundation published
its first edition of the Index of Economic Freedom in 1995, Venezuela
scored two points above the worldwide average.

So what happened? According to The Atlantic:

**[\"The [experiment with \'21st-century socialism\']{.mark} as
introduced by the late President Hugo Chavez, a self-described champion
of the poor who [vowed to distribute the]{.mark} [country\'s
wealth]{.mark} among the masses, and instead [steered the nation toward
the catastrophe the world is witnessing]{.mark} under his handpicked
successor (Nicolas) Maduro, has been a cruel failure.\"]{.underline}**

That\'s putting it mildly. And the **[[track record elsewhere
isn\'t]{.mark} much [better]{.mark}. From [Albania]{.mark} and
[Angola]{.mark} to [Vietnam]{.mark} and [Yemen, socialism]{.mark} has
[produced]{.mark} little but [violence]{.mark}, [starvation]{.mark} and
[misery]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Some defenders point to Norway and other Scandinavian countries that
enjoy a degree of prosperity well above the ones already mentioned. But
as columnist David Harsanyi points out, **[you can hardly call countries
that are \"operating generous welfare states programs propped up by
underlying vibrant capitalism\" poster children for
socialism.]{.underline}**

The fact remains that **[[wherever unalloyed socialism]{.mark} has been
[tried]{.mark}, the [result has been disastrous]{.mark} for the citizens
it\'s inflicted on. Take any economy run by an all-powerful state, and
it\'s [only a question of when]{.mark}, not if, [it winds up being run
completely into the ground]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Take another example much closer to home: **[[Cuba]{.mark}. The vibrant,
modern island nation that existed [prior to 1959]{.mark} stands in stark
[contrast to]{.mark} the Cuba of [2018]{.mark}, a [brutally repressive
regime]{.mark} where struggling workers who don\'t even earn a living
wage can be thrown in jail for saying something that offends the ruling
elite.]{.underline}**

**[Contrast that with the experience of those who live [in capitalist
societies]{.mark}, where [rights]{.mark} are [protected, life]{.mark}
spans are [longer]{.mark}, and people enjoy a higher standard of
living.]{.underline}**

The Index of Economic Freedom, which has graded every country in the
world annually for nearly 25 years, bears this out. Again and again, it
finds **[[per capita incomes]{.mark} are much [higher in nations]{.mark}
that are [more economically free.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Economies rated \"free\" or \"mostly free\" in the latest edition
enjoy incomes more than double the average levels in other
countries]{.underline}**, and more than five times higher than the
incomes of people living in \"repressed\" economies such as Venezuela
and Cuba.

The evidence is hard to refute. Consider what Bono, humanitarian and
rock singer, says he\'s learned in the course of spearheading numerous
anti-poverty initiatives over the years:

\"As a person who\'s spent nearly 30 years fighting to get people out of
poverty, it was somewhat humbling to realize that commerce played a
bigger job than development. I\'d say that\'s my biggest transformation
in 10 years: understanding the power of commerce to make or break
lives.\"

By \"power of commerce,\" of course, he means capitalism.

But should we be surprised that it has socialism beat when it comes to
generating human health and wealth? **[[When people are free]{.mark} to
make their own decisions and follow their dreams, it\'s only natural
that their [everyday life]{.mark} is [better than]{.mark} that
experienced by people [under]{.mark} the thumb of a dominating,
all-controlling [state]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

If you doubt that, remember the **[many people who have risked their
lives and even died trying to escape Cuba. They flee to America. It\'s
never the other way around]{.underline}**.

[**[Myth]{.mark}** #3: [Socialism is working in]{.mark} Denmark and the
other [Scandinavian countries. ]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[In truth,** Denmark has a free-market economy**]{.mark}---and it is
[capitalism]{.mark} that [enables]{.mark} the [Danish]{.mark}
[government to]{.mark} finance a bountiful welfare
state]{.underline} through top-to-bottom personal income and VAT
taxes.[ A frustrated [Danish prime minister]{.mark} told a shocked
Washington audience, \"I would [like to make one thing clea]{.mark}r
.... **[Denmark is a market economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\" Denmark
(along with the other Nordic countries) has relatively few business
regulations and no minimum wage, leading one economist to say,
\"**[[Denmark]{.mark} is probably [more capitalist than the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**.\" 

**[Myth #4: Socialism has never failed because it has never been truly
tried]{.underline}**.

[In fact, **[socialism]{.mark} has [failed everywhere it has been
attempted]{.mark}** for over a century, [from the Bolshevik
Revolution]{.mark} of 1917 [to]{.mark} present-day Chavez-Maduro
socialism in [Venezuela]{.mark}]{.underline}.[ Nowhere has democratic
socialism been more faithfully practiced and then rejected]{.underline}
by public demand than in [Israel, India and the United
Kingdom]{.underline} following the end of World War II.  

[[Israel]{.mark}'s first settlers [sought to create]{.mark} an [economy
in which market forces were controlled]{.mark} for the benefit of all.
[Socialism worked until Israel suffered]{.mark} its first [major
recession]{.mark}]{.underline} despite extensive government controls.
[[The **government reversed course and adopted a market
economy**]{.mark}. A high-tech revolution swept the country,
[transform]{.mark}ing [Israel into]{.mark} a **major [global player in
technology]{.mark}. **]{.underline}

[Following independence in 1948, [India adhered]{.mark} strictly
[to]{.mark} a [socialist ideology]{.mark}]{.underline}. But wars,
drought and the oil price crisis of [1973 shook the country---[half of
the population]{.mark} lived [in poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
[[government abandoned socialism and India]{.mark}'s **[middle class
expanded enormously]{.mark}**, becoming the largest in the free
world]{.underline}. Never before in recorded history, wrote an Indian
journalist, have so many people risen so quickly.  

[[After]{.mark} three decades of [socialism]{.mark}, the [U]{.mark}nited
[K]{.mark}ingdom [experience]{.mark}d a [socio-economic
revolution]{.mark}]{.underline} in the 1980s with the election of
Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Privatization was a core
Thatcher reform. [The [government sold off government-owned]{.mark}
airlines, airports, utilities, and phone, steel and oil
[companies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Turning from Keynes to Hayek, the once
\"sick man of Europe\"[[ quickly]{.mark} responded, **[recovering robust
economic health]{.mark}.  **]{.underline}

[Whether it was a small Middle Eastern country, a large agricultural
country with a population of 1.3 billon,]{.underline} or the nation that
sparked the industrial revolution, **[[capitalism top]{.mark}ped
[socialism every time.  ]{.mark}]{.underline}**

This is the true story of socialism, a pseudo-religion posing as a
pseudo-science and run by political elites. It could only be adopted in
America if we repudiated every principle of the founding, did away with
federalism, regulated the 33 million small businesses that produce
nearly half the jobs in America, and heavily taxed everyone, not just
the top 1%, to pay for the government needed to run the lives of 330
million Americans from the cradle to the grave.      

[[Millennials]{.mark} do [have a choice]{.mark}: the
[suffocating]{.mark} embrace of [socialism]{.mark}, under [which]{.mark}
individual [freedom]{.mark} and responsibility are [surrendered]{.mark},
[or the freedom of ]{.mark}democratic [capitalism,** under which people
of all colors and classes can work to be whatever they want to
be. **]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Socialism's ignoring of incentives causes it to be [doomed]{.underline} to failure

**Perry 22** \[Mark J., 6-22-2022, \"Why Socialism Failed,\" No
Publication, https://fee.org/articles/why-socialism-failed/, smarx,
HHW\]

[[Socialism]{.mark} is the [Big Lie]{.mark} of the Twentieth century.
While it [promised prosperity, equality, and security, it delivered
poverty, misery, and tyranny]{.mark}. [Equality]{.mark} was
[achieved]{.mark} only [in the sense]{.mark} that [everyone was equal
in]{.mark} his or her [misery]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In the same way that a Ponzi scheme or chain letter initially succeeds
but eventually collapses, [[socialism]{.mark} may [show early signs of
success]{.mark}. But any [accomplishments quickly fade]{.mark} as the
fundamental deficiencies of central planning emerge.]{.underline} It is
the initial illusion of success that gives government intervention its
pernicious, seductive appeal. In the long run, **[[socialism]{.mark} has
[always proven to be a formula for tyranny and
misery.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Socialism Ignores Incentives]{.underline}**

A pyramid scheme is ultimately unsustainable because it is based on
faulty principles. Likewise, collectivism is unsustainable in the long
run because it is a flawed theory. [[Socialism does not work]{.mark}
because it is [not consistent with]{.mark} fundamental [principles of
human behavior]{.mark}. The [failure]{.mark} of socialism in countries
around the world can be [traced to one]{.mark} critical [defect]{.mark}:
it is a **[system that ignores incentives]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Under socialism, **[incentives either play a minimal role or are ignored
totally]{.underline}**.

[[In]{.mark} a [capitalist economy]{.mark}, [incentives are of the
utmost importance]{.mark}. Market prices, the profit-and-loss system of
accounting, and private property rights [provide an efficient]{.mark},
interrelated [system]{.mark}]{.underline} of incentives to guide and
direct economic behavior. [Capitalism is based on the theory that
incentives matter!]{.underline}

[[Under socialism]{.mark}, [incentives]{.mark} either [play]{.mark} a
[minimal role]{.mark} or are ignored totally]{.underline}. A centrally
planned economy without market prices or profits, where
[p[roperty]{.underline}]{.mark} [is [owned by the state, is]{.mark} a
[system without]{.mark} an effective [incentive]{.mark} mechanism to
direct economic activity. [By failing to]{.mark} emphasize
[incentive]{.mark}s, [socialism is]{.mark} a theory [inconsistent with
human nature and]{.mark} is therefore **[doomed to
fail]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Socialism is based on the theory that
incentives don't matter!

### 1AR \-- AT: Socialism

#### Socialism has never worked -- 3 examples

Lee **Edwards 19** \[Lee Edwards, 10-16-2019, \"Three Nations That Tried
Socialism and Rejected It,\" Heritage Foundation,
https://www.heritage.org/progressivism/commentary/three-nations-tried-socialism-and-rejected-it,
smarx, HHW\]

[[Socialists]{.mark} are fond of [say]{.mark}ing that [socialism]{.mark}
has [never failed]{.mark} because it has never been tried. But [in
truth, **socialism has failed in every country in which it has been
tried**]{.mark}**,** from the [Soviet Union]{.mark} beginning a century
ago [to]{.mark} three modern countries that tried but ultimately
rejected socialism---[Israel, India, and the U]{.mark}nited
[K]{.mark}ingdom.]{.underline}

While there were major political differences between the totalitarian
rule of the Soviets and the democratic politics of Israel, India, and
the U.K., all three of the latter countries adhered to socialist
principles, nationalizing their major industries and placing economic
decision-making in the hands of the government.

[The [Soviet failure]{.mark} has been [well documented]{.mark} by
historians]{.underline}. In 1985, General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev
took command of a bankrupt disintegrating empire. [[After 70
years]{.mark} of Marxism, Soviet **[farms]{.mark} were [unable to
feed]{.mark} the people, [factories failed to meet]{.mark} their
[quotas]{.mark}**, people lined up for blocks in Moscow and other cities
to buy bread and other necessities, [and]{.mark} a [war]{.mark} in
Afghanistan [dragged on with no end in sight]{.mark} of the body bags of
young Soviet soldiers.]{.underline}

[The economies of the Communist nations behind the Iron Curtain were
similarly enfeebled]{.underline} because they functioned in large
measure as colonies of the Soviet Union. [[With no incentives to]{.mark}
compete or [modernize]{.mark}, the [industrial sector of]{.mark} Eastern
and Central [Europe]{.mark} became a [monument to]{.mark} bureaucratic
inefficiency and [waste]{.mark}, a "**museum of the early industrial
age**.]{.underline}" As the New York Times pointed out [at the time,
[Singapore]{.mark}, an Asian [city-state of]{.mark} only [2 million
people, exported]{.mark} 20 percent [more machinery]{.mark} to the West
in 1987 **[than all of Eastern Europe]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

And yet, [[socialism still beguiled]{.mark} leading intellectuals and
[politicians]{.mark}]{.underline} of the West. [They [could not
resist]{.underline}]{.mark} [its siren song, of a world without strife
because it was a world without private property. They were convinced
that a bureaucracy could make more-informed decisions about the welfare
of a people than the people themselves could.]{.underline} They
believed, with John Maynard Keynes, that "the state is wise and the
market is stupid."

[[Israel, India, and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [K]{.mark}ingdom [all
adopted socialism]{.mark} as an economic model following World War
II.]{.underline} The preamble to India's constitution, for example,
begins, "We, the People of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute
India into a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic . . ." The
original settlers of Israel were East European Jews of the Left who
sought and built a socialist society. As soon as the guns of World War
II fell silent, Britain's Labour Party nationalized every major industry
and acceded to every socialist demand of the unions.

[[At first, socialism seemed to work]{.mark} in these vastly dissimilar
countries. For the first two decades of its existence, [Israel's economy
grew]{.mark} at an annual rate of more than 10 percent,]{.underline}
leading many to term Israel an "economic miracle." [The average GDP
growth rate of India from its founding in 1947 into the 1970s was 3.5
percent, placing [India among]{.mark} the more [prosperous developing
nations]{.mark}]{.underline}. [GDP growth in Great Britain averaged 3
percent from 1950 to 1965]{.underline}, along with a 40 percent rise in
average real wages, enabling [[Britain]{.mark} to [become one of]{.mark}
the [world's more affluent countries]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[But the [government planners]{.mark} were **[unable to keep pace with
increasing population]{.mark} and [overseas competition]{.mark}**. After
decades of [ever **declining economic growth**]{.mark} **and [ever
rising unemployment]{.mark}**[, all]{.mark} three countries [abandoned
socialism]{.mark} and [turned toward capitalism]{.mark} and the free
market]{.underline}. The resulting prosperity in Israel, India, and the
U.K. vindicated free-marketers who had [[predicted]{.mark} that
[socialism]{.mark} would [inevitably fail]{.mark} to deliver the goods.
As [British]{.mark} [p]{.mark}rime [m]{.mark}inister Margaret Thatcher
[observed]{.mark}, "the [problem with socialism]{.mark} is that you
**[eventually run out of other people's money]{.mark}."**]{.underline}

#### Alt fails -- history proves socialism increases human suffering

**Muravchik 19** \[Joshua Muravchik, 4-9-2019, \"Socialism Fails Every
Time,\" WSJ,
https://www.wsj.com/articles/socialism-fails-every-time-11554851786,
SMarx, JTong\]

Self-described socialist Bernie Sanders has become a favorite of young
voters by posing as an apostle of daring new ideas.
**[[Socialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[is anything but
new]{.mark}. [It's hard to think of another idea that has been tried and
failed as many times in as many ways or at a steeper price in human
suffering.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The term "socialism" was coined by followers of Robert Owen (1771-1858),
whom Karl Marx would label a "utopian socialist." In 1825 Owen founded
New Harmony, an Indiana commune, to demonstrate the superiority of what
was first called the "social system." The same year, Owen explained his
experiment to a joint session of Congress attended by Supreme Court
justices, President James Monroe and President-elect John Quincy Adams.
Although Owen poured his fortune into it, New Harmony collapsed in
disarray and recrimination within two years.

Owen's son Robert Dale Owen salvaged the community by implementing what
he called "a policy the very reverse" of socialism: "giving each
respectable citizen every facility and encouragement to become (what
every adult ought to be) a landed proprietor."

Undeterred, others founded some 40 to 50 similar communes during the
19th century, and all collapsed quickly. New Harmony's two years proved
to be their median lifespan.

Based on the uniformly dismal results, the idea of socialism might have
died a quiet death were it not for Marx (1818-83), who transformed
socialism from an experiment---tried, tested and failed---into a
prophecy, "the riddle of history solved." Ironically, he called his
vision "scientific socialism."

Inspired by the dream of proletarian revolution overthrowing capitalist
immiseration, socialist parties sprouted across Europe. **[Yet [instead
of growing poorer, workers in industrialized countries saw improvement
in their living standards]{.mark}; and instead of disappearing, middle
classes expanded]{.underline}**---all disproving Marx.

It took Vladimir Lenin's "vanguard" and the horrors of World War I to
give socialism new life**[[. In Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Lenin
pioneered modern communism, which in the 20th century was imposed on 18
countries and one-third of mankind. **[[Repression was justified by
socialism's purported economic benefits, but the actual trade-off
entailed economic misery]{.mark} and the snuffing out of as many as 100
million lives.]{.underline}**

Today Communist parties rule six countries. Most follow the lead of
China, where the party redefined itself to include entrepreneurs. A 2012
Wall Street Journal report identified 160 people with an average net
worth of more than \$1 billion holding high government or party seats.
No Chinese Bernie Sanders rails against them.

"Social democrats" and "democratic socialists" rejected Lenin's methods.
But their goals remained transformational. As British Labour Party
leader Clement Attlee, who became prime minister in 1945, explained:
"Our policy was not a reformed capitalism but progress toward a
democratic socialism." Labour sought to bring "main factors in the
economic system"---including banks, mining and energy---under "public
ownership and control." Nationalization worked so badly, however, that
Attlee soon beat a retreat and was voted out in 1951.

In 1981 Socialist François Mitterrand was elected president of France
promising a clean "rupture" with capitalism. The results of his spending
and nationalizations were so alarming that in 1982 Mitterrand reversed
course and implemented austerity measures, which he dubbed "socialist
rigor" to save face. "The aim is to bring about a real reconciliation
between the left and the economy," explained Socialist Party chief
Lionel Jospin.

American socialists like Mr. Sanders, while often defending the likes of
Fidel Castro, Daniel Ortega, Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro, prefer to
point to Scandinavia as a model. But Scandinavian social democrats
learned to settle for dense social safety nets underwritten by
remarkably free, capitalist economies. On the World Bank's Ease of Doing
Business scale, Denmark ranks third of 190 countries, Norway seventh and
Sweden 12th.

Still other forms of socialism arose in the Third World. Encouraged by
United Nations development experts, virtually all newly decolonized
states adopted "African Socialism," "Arab Socialism" or other variants.
The result was years of economic stagnation until the successful models
of East Asia began to reverse their thinking.

Successful socialism has been created in only one place on earth, the
kibbutzim of Israel. They were democratic and egalitarian; sharing
possessions, meals, even child rearing. But once the Jewish state was
securely on its feet, kibbutzniks chose to switch to private enterprise.
Socialism, they learned to their surprise, was not a happy way to live.

**[[Socialism has failed everywhere it's been tried]{.mark}---even where
it succeeded. [Surely today's]{.mark} young [people]{.mark} [can]{.mark}
create their own ideas and [make their own mistakes rather than repeat
those that darkened the times of]{.mark}]{.underline}** their parents,
grandparents [and **[the generations
before]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}**

#### Socialism causes environmental deterioration, [only]{.underline} capitalism can sustain a clean environment by making more with less

**Regan 19** \[Shawn Regan, 5-17-2019, \"Socialism Is Bad for the
Environment,\"
https://www.perc.org/2019/05/17/socialism-is-bad-for-the-environment/,smarx,
HHW\]

[How can this be? "[Environmental deterioration was not supposed to
occur under socialism]{.mark}]{.underline}[,"]{.mark} Cuban-American
researchers Sergio Díaz-Briquets and Jorge Pérez-López wrote in a
detailed study of Cuba's environmental legacy. "[According to
conventional Marxist-Leninist dogma, **[environmental deterioration was
precipitated by the logic of capitalism and its relentless pursuit of
profits]{.mark}**]{.underline}[." [Socialism, on the other hand, would
avoid capitalism's excesses]{.underline}]{.mark}. "Guided by
'scientific' principles, socialism's goal was a classless and bountiful
society," they explained, "populated by men and women living in harmony
with each other and the environment."

[But this was clearly not the case in the Soviet empire. Nor was it in
Cuba, whose environmental record after decades of socialist control
was]{.underline} described by Díaz-Briquets and Pérez-López as "[far
different from the utopian view." The West, meanwhile, had not only the
consumer goods that socialist societies lacked but **also a cleaner
environment**.]{.underline}

One explanation for the disparity is that [[central planners, unlike
markets, **grossly misallocate resources**]{.mark}, as a matter of
routine. Energy prices, for example, were highly subsidized in the
socialist economies]{.underline} of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
As a result, [**industrial production was far more energy-intensive**
throughout the socialist world than in Western European
economies]{.underline}---five to ten times higher, according to one
estimate---[leading to more pollution]{.underline}. A 1992 World Bank
study found that more than [half of the air pollution in the former
Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe could be attributed to subsidized
energy pricing during this period.]{.underline}

[A related problem was the **fixation of socialist planners on heavy
industry at the expense of the environment.** "]{.underline}The singular
dominant fact of the Soviet economic strategy," Jeffrey Sachs has noted,
"was the subordination of all human and economic goals to the
development of heavy industry." [Industrial pollution from factories in
Eastern Europe was so bad that Time described it as the region "where
the sky stays dark." Acid rain in Krakow severely damaged the city's
historic structures and buildings,]{.underline} some of which required
renovations, and even corroded the faces of many centuries-old statues.

Of course, [industry behind the [Iron Curtain was anything but
efficient, and central planning caused **excessive use of natural
resources**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A 1991 study by Mikhail Bernstam found
that [market economies used about one-third as much energy and steel per
unit of GDP as did socialist countries]{.underline}. Likewise, Polish
economist Tomasz Zylicz found that the non-market economies of Central
and Eastern Europe required two to three times more inputs to produce a
given output than did Western European economies. ([The former Soviet
world, as well as China, also emitted several times more carbon per unit
of GDP than the United States did---a trend that continues today.)
Simply put, **[market economies make more with less and are therefore
better for the environment]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

#### Environmental degradation under socialism is [inevitable]{.underline} 

Thomas **DiLorenzo 22** \[Thomas J., 7-1-2022, \"Why Socialism Causes
Pollution,\" No Publication,
https://fee.org/articles/why-socialism-causes-pollution/, smarx, HHW\]

[The Soviet Union]{.underline}

[In [the Soviet Union]{.mark} there was a vast body of environmental law
and regulation that purportedly protected the public interest, but these
constraints have had no perceivable benefit. The Soviet
Union,]{.underline} like all socialist countries, **[[suffered from a
massive \"tragedy of the commons]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" to borrow the
term used by biologist Garrett Hardin in his classic 1968 article.
[[Where property is communally]{.mark} or governmentally owned and
treated as a free resource, **[resources will inevitably be
overused]{.mark}** with little regard for future
consequences.]{.underline}

[[The Soviet government's imperatives for economic growth, combined with
communal ownership]{.mark} of virtually all property and resources,
[caused **tremendous environmental damage**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
According to economist Marshall Goldman, who studied and traveled
extensively in the Soviet Union, \"The attitude that nature is there to
be exploited by man is the very essence of the Soviet production
ethic.\"

[A typical example of the environmental damage caused by the Soviet
economic system is the [exploitation of the Black
Sea]{.mark}]{.underline}. To comply with five-year plans for housing and
building construction, gravel, sand, and trees around the beaches were
used for decades as construction materials. [Because there is no private
property, \"no value is attached to the gravel along the seashore.
Since, in effect, it is free, the contractors haul it away. This
practice caused massive beach erosion which reduced the Black Sea coast
by 50 percent]{.underline} between 1920 and 1960. [Eventually, hotels,
hospitals, and of all things, a military sanitarium collapsed into the
sea as the shoreline gave way]{.underline}. Frequent landslides--as many
as 300 per year--have been reported.

[**[Water pollution is catastrophic]{.mark}**. Effluent from a chemical
plant killed almost all the fish in the Oka River in 1965, and similar
fish kills have occurred in the Volga, Ob, Yenesei, Ural, and Northern
Dvina rivers.]{.underline} Most Russian factories discharge their waste
without cleaning it at all. Mines, oil wells, and ships freely dump
waste and ballast into any available body of water, since it is all one
big (and tragic) \"commons.\"

[Only six of the 20 main cities in Moldavia had a sewer system by the
late 1960s, and only two of those cities made any effort to treat the
sewage]{.underline}. Conditions are far more primitive in the
countryside.

[[The Aral and Caspian seas]{.mark} have been gradually disappearing as
large quantities of their water have been diverted for irrigation. And
since untreated sewage flows into feeder rivers, they [are **also
heavily polluted**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

[Some Soviet authorities expressed fears that by the turn of the century
the Aral Sea will be nothing but a salt marsh.]{.underline} One paper
reported that because of the rising salt content of the Aral the
remaining fish will rapidly disappear. It was recently revealed that the
[[**Aral Sea has shrunk by about a third**. Its shore line \"is arid
desert]{.mark} and the wind blows dry deposits of salt thousands of
miles away. [The **infant mortality rate \[in that region\] is four to
five times the national average**]{.mark}**.\"**]{.underline}

[The declining water level in the Caspian Sea has been catastrophic for
its fish population as spawning areas have turned into dry
land.]{.underline} The sturgeon population has been so decimated that
the Soviets have experimented with producing artificial caviar.
[Hundreds of factories and refineries along the Caspian Sea dump
**untreated waste into the sea**, and major **cities routinely dump raw
sewage**]{.underline}. It has been estimated that one-half of all the
discharged effluent is carried in the Volga River, which flows into the
Caspian Sea. The [concentration of oil in the Volga is so great that
steamboats are equipped with signs forbidding passengers to toss
cigarettes overboard. As might be expected, fish kills along the Volga
are a \"**common calamity**.\"]{.underline}

Lake Baikal, which is believed to be the oldest freshwater lake in the
world, is also one of the largest and deepest. It is five times as deep
as Lake Superior and contains twice the volume of water. According to
Marshall Goldman, it was also \"the [best known example of the misuse of
water resources in the USSR.\"]{.underline}

[Factories and pulp mills have been dumping hundreds of millions of
gallons of effluent into Lake Baikal each year for decades. As a result,
animal life in the lake has been cut by more than 50 percent over the
past half century.]{.underline} Untreated sewage is dumped into
virtually all tributaries to the lake.

[Islands of alkaline sewage have been observed floating on the lake,
including one that was 18 miles long and three miles wide. These
\"islands\" have **polluted the air around the lake as well as the
water** in it.]{.underline} Thousands of acres of forest surrounding the
lake have been denuded, causing such erosion that dust storms have been
reported. So much forest land in the Lake Baikal region has been
destroyed that some observers reported shifting sands that link up with
the Gobi Desert; [there are fears that the desert may sweep into Siberia
and destroy the lake.]{.underline}

In other regions the fact that no compensation has to be paid for land
that is flooded by water projects has made it easy for government
engineers to submerge large areas of land. \"As much land has been lost
through flooding and salination as has been added through irrigation and
drainage in the Soviet Union.\"

**[Th[ese examples of environment degradation in the Soviet Union are
not meant to be exhaustive but to illustrate the phenomenon of Communist
pollution]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Goldman has observed, the [great
pollution problems in Russia stem from the fact that the government
determined that economic growth was to be pursued at any
cost]{.underline}. \"Government officials in the USSR generally have a
greater willingness to sacrifice their environment than government
officials in a society with private enterprise where there is a degree
of public accountability. There is virtually a political as well as an
economic imperative to devour idle resources in the USSR.\"

#### Alt solves poverty and climate -- eco-socialism in China combined poverty alleviation with ecological development

**Huan and Huan 2022** (Qingzhi Huan is professor of comparative
politics at Peking University in China, Xincong Huan is a professor of
comparative politics in Peking University, **[4/12/22, A Frugal
Eco-Innovation Policy? Ecological Poverty Alleviation in Contemporary
China from a Perspective of Eco-Civilization Progress]{.underline}**,
<https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/8/4570>, //JL)

Poverty relief or anti-poverty has been a long-term policy target of the
CPC and government over the past decades \[42,43\]. **[After its reform
and opening-up in 1978, [China successfully organized and
implemented]{.mark} a large-scale strategic action of
[development-oriented poverty alleviation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and
the implementation of "the Seven-Year Program for Lifting 80 Million
People out of Poverty (1994--2000)" marked the beginning of a crucial
stage of China's poverty alleviation efforts. Notably, this seven-year
program described overcoming ecological imbalance as one of the main
tasks in the process of poverty alleviation and proposed to "speed up
re-vegetation, combat wind and desertification, reduce forest resource
consumption and improve ecological environment" \[44\] (p. 783).
**[Since the beginning of the 21st century, [combining poverty
alleviation and sustainable development]{.mark} gradually [evolved as
the guiding principle for China's poverty alleviation and
development]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, "the Outline for
China's Rural Poverty Alleviation and Development (2001--2010)" issued
by the State Council clearly expounded the policy measures of
sustainable development in poverty alleviation and development. This
program emphasizes that "all solutions to the poverty problem should be
based on the principle that it is conducive to improving and protecting
ecological environment and achieving sustainable development" \[45\] (p.
1880). Ten years later, the Central Committee of CPC and the State
Council jointly released "the Outline for China's Rural Poverty
Alleviation and Development (2011--2020)". This new program explicitly
**[[describes the improvement of the ecological environment as]{.mark}
one of the [main task]{.mark}s [in]{.mark} the [new stage of poverty
alleviation]{.mark} and development, requiring "to combine poverty
alleviation and development with ecological restoration and
environmental protection,]{.underline}** give full play to the
advantages of resources in poverty-stricken areas, **[[develop
environmentally friendly industries, enhance disaster prevention and
reduction capabilities]{.mark}, promote a healthy and scientific
lifestyle[, and boost the coordination between economic development and
population, resources and environment]{.mark}]{.underline}**" \[46\]
(pp. 357--358). Another milestone in the evolution of China's poverty
alleviation strategy is the 18th National Congress of the CPC in 2012.
The ambitious national goal of "building a moderately prosperous society
in all aspects" was approved at this congress, which includes several
index requirements such as substantially reducing the impoverished
population, **[achieving an overall improvement in the people's living
standards and enhancing the stability of ecosystems]{.underline}**
\[26\]. In 2013, Xi Jinping, the Secretary-General of the CPC, proposed
his idea of "targeted poverty alleviation" for the first time, which
emphasizes the importance of combining poverty alleviation, development
and ecological environment protection. In 2015, he further elaborated a
package plan of five-key-measures for poverty alleviation and
development; "relocation" and "ecological compensation" are included,
stressing that "**[We can explore [a new path of ecological poverty
alleviation by integrating environmental protection and governance with
poverty alleviation]{.mark}]{.underline}**" \[47\] (p. 65). Shortly
after that, the Central Committee of the CPC and the State Council
jointly issued "the Decision on Winning the Tough Battle against
Poverty", which prioritizes ecological protection in poverty alleviation
and development and systematically expounds the policy requirements for
realizing poverty alleviation through improving ecological environment
protection \[48\]. In the working report to the 19th National Congress
of CPC in 2017, "targeted poverty alleviation" was defined as one of
"the three tough battles" to secure a decisive victory in finishing the
building of a moderately prosperous society in all aspects \[27\]
(pp.27--28). On this basis, at the beginning of 2018, the National
Development and Reform Commission \[49\] together with five other
ministries jointly formulated "the Work Plan for Ecological Poverty
Alleviation". This document highlights the notion of eco-civilization
progress that "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets",
and enumerates manifold **[policy tasks and initiatives to increase
farmers' income and ecological progress such as [implement]{.mark}ing
[ecological conservation projects,]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[ecological
public-welfare compensation and ecological industries
development,]{.underline}** **[strengthening the coordination between
poverty alleviation, ecological environment protection and
the]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[mutual [promot]{.mark}ion between [poverty
alleviation and sustainable development]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Later
that year, "the National Strategy for Revitalizing the Rural Areas
(2018--2022)" was jointly issued by the Central Committee of the CPC and
the State Council, calling for "fully implementing the national strategy
of targeted poverty alleviation and building a new pattern of rural
development in which man and nature coexist in harmony" \[50\] (p. 4).
**[In short, after more than two decades, "[ecological poverty
alleviation" as a policy tool has gradually developed into an integral
part of China's national strategy of "targeted poverty
alleviation]{.mark}]{.underline}**" as well as a practical approach full
of political imagination for advancing eco-civilization progress in the
New Era.

**[Although [a prosperous economy]{.mark} is good in itself, it
[is]{.mark} no less [significant]{.mark} for its contribution
[to]{.mark} America's first principle of ordered
[liberty]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In the words of the cultural historian
Russell Kirk, economic production (or **[[capitalism) is the means "to
raise man above the savage level]{.mark}, to make possible the leisure
which sustains civilization]{.underline}** and to free man from the
condition of being a simple drudge." **[[Private ownership of property
is]{.mark} [not greed]{.mark}]{.underline}**, Kirk argued, **[[but
"one]{.mark} of the most powerful [instrument]{.mark}s [for

economists Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman both recognized that
private property encourages wise decisions and requires individuals to
accept the consequences of their choices. **[[Capitalism puts a premium
on industry, thrift, honesty, and ingenuity]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[It is not capitalism that is ruthless, wrote the economist John
Attarian, but [socialism]{.mark}, which]{.underline}** makes a society
ruthless by **[[denying individuals]{.mark} the [ability to]{.mark}
[make]{.mark} their own [decisions]{.mark} and turning government into
the master]{.underline}**. **[Nowhere is [the]{.mark} stark
[difference]{.mark} between socialism and capitalism more

**[South Korea (the lower half) is a glittering Christmas tree that
[offers a vision of]{.mark} what [the world]{.mark} looks like [under
freedom]{.mark}. North Korea (the upper half) is a dark
wilderness]{.underline}**, suggesting what the world might look like
were "the torch of human liberty to sputter out, casting civilization
into darkness."

### 2AC \-- AT: Democratic Socialism

#### Alt fails despite being democratic -- even if it starts out democratic, communist parties don't last that way

**Somin 17** (Ilya, a law professor at George Mason University, is the

and \"The Grasping Hand: Kelo v. City of New London and the Limits of

ML)

[To this day, [defenders]{.mark} of socialist central planning [argue
that]{.mark} communism failed for avoidable contingent
reasons]{.underline}, rather than ones intrinsic to the nature of the
system. Perhaps [the most popular claim of this sort is that [a planned
economy can work well so long as it is democratic.]{.mark} The Soviet
Union and other communist states were all dictatorships. But [if]{.mark}
they had been [democratic]{.mark}]{.underline}, perhaps the leaders
would have had stronger incentives to make the system work for the
benefit of the people. If they failed to do so, [the [voters could
"throw the bastards out" at the next election]{.mark}. [Unfortunately,
it is unlikely that a communist state could remain democratic for long,
even it started out that way. Democracy requires effective opposition
parties.]{.mark}]{.underline} And in order to function, such parties
need to be able to put out their message and mobilize voters, which in
turn requires extensive resources. [[In an economic system in which all
or nearly all valuable resources are controlled by the state, the
incumbent government can easily strangle opposition by denying them
access to those resources]{.mark}. Under socialism, the [opposition
cannot function if they are not allowed to spread their message on
state-owned media]{.mark}, or use state-owned property for their rallies
and meetings. [It is no accident that virtually every communist regime
suppressed opposition parties soon after coming to
power.]{.mark}]{.underline} Even if a communist state could somehow
remain democratic over the long run, it is hard to see how it could
solve the twin problems of knowledge and incentives. [[Whether
democratic or not, a socialist economy would still require enormous
concentration of power, and extensive coercion]{.mark}. And [democratic
socialist planners would run into much the same info]{.mark}rmation
[problems as their authoritarian counterparts.]{.mark}]{.underline} In
addition, in a society where the government controls all or most of the
economy, [it would be virtually impossible for voters to acquire enough
knowledge to monitor the state's many activities.]{.underline} This
would greatly exacerbate the already severe problem of voter ignorance
that plagues modern democracy.

### 2AC \-- AT: Redistribution of Wealth

#### Alt fails -- taking money away from the rich does nothing

[**[What does not matter ethically are]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}**]{.mark} routine historical [**[ups and downs
of]{.underline}** **[the Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, or
the vulgar excesses of the 1 percent of the 1
percent]{.underline}**,]{.mark} of a sort one could have seen on display
three centuries ago in Versailles, or thirty centuries ago in Egypt.
**[[There are not enough]{.mark} really [rich people to make
expropriating them serve any purpose ex- cept stoking envy. If we seized
all the assets of the eighty-five wealthiest people]{.mark} in the world
[to make a fund to give annually to the poorest half, it would raise
their spending power by less than 10 cents a
day]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} 3 The assets of the wealthiest
eighty-five persons were reported in 2014 by Oxfam to total \$1.7
trillion. (There is, by the way, something screwy about Oxfam's number
here, because the world's interest-bearing assets are on the order of
scores of trillions, and if including the assets of human capital, too,
they are on the order of hundreds of trillions. But let's go with
Oxfam's figure for the nonce.) If a fund of that size earned a robust 7
percent annual return, there would be \$119 billion a year, which is
only \$326 million a day, to distribute among the poorest half, 3.6
billion people---or 9 cents per person. **[[All the foreign aid to
Africa or]{.mark} South and Central America,]{.underline}** to give an-
other example of how redistribution does not accomplish a great deal,
**[[is dwarfed by the amount that nations in such areas would gain if
the people of Europe or the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [abandoned
tariffs]{.mark} and other protections for their already rich
agriculture]{.underline}**.4 The way to help the poor, in short, is to
let the Great Enrichment proceed by commercially tested betterment, as
it has widely since 1800 and especially in the past forty years.
**[[Charity or expropriation is not efficacious]{.mark},]{.underline}**
particularly considering that the charity in foreign aid or the ex-
propriation by military coup has flowed into Swiss bank accounts, not
into the subsistence of the poor. **[A high market price for the poor

### 2AC \-- AT: Alternative Economic Systems

#### Capitalism is the only system that works -- any other economic system is doomed to failure

[As the new year begins, students will again be exposed to
[minds]{.mark} that [assert]{.mark} the dangers and [evils of
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. These thinkers have every right to put
forth such beliefs --- that is what America is all about. But [[be
weary]{.mark} of such cynicism. Instead, [try thinking]{.mark} of the
world's predominant economic system [in]{.mark} both a personal and
[rational manner]{.mark}. Then you will **understand its true
value.**]{.underline}

As an American, I am [[incredibly fortunate to live in a nation]{.mark}
whose economic tradition centers [around]{.mark}
[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It has [made this nation
prosperous]{.mark} and [provided]{.mark} me with [opportunities]{.mark}
unrealized in centrally planned economies]{.underline} --- a thriving
free market in which I am free to use my earned money as I wish, enroll
in the university I wish to attend and [l[ead the life I wish to
lead]{.underline}]{.mark} [--- [unburdened by]{.mark} the dictates of
[inefficient and ineffective central planning. All]{.mark} of this
[stems from]{.mark} the economic freedom and [choice that capitalism,
not socialism]{.mark} or Marxism, [provides]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In a speech on Nov. 11, 1947, [Sir Winston Churchill reminded the UK's
House of Commons that "democracy is the worst form of government, except
for all those others that have been tried." In a similar fashion,
**[capitalism]{.mark} is the [worst economic system, except for all the
others]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Capitalism]{.mark} is no different from anything else in this world.
It is [imperfect]{.mark} because imperfect men created it. Humans are
not perfect, nor are they capable of perfection]{.underline}. Avarice
and greed are not unique to capitalism. They were present in the USSR,
and they will be present in any man-made system.

[Since the fall of the Soviet Union, [free market systems]{.mark} have
been [implemented in]{.mark} numerous [former Soviet States.]{.mark}
Perhaps nowhere better illustrates [capitalism's success]{.mark} in
post-Iron Curtain Europe than [in]{.mark} the country of
[Estonia]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[On Oct. 21, 1992, [Mart Laar]{.mark} became [P]{.mark}rime
[M]{.mark}inister [of]{.mark} the [new]{.mark}ly independent
[nation]{.mark}. He was [only 32]{.mark} years old.]{.underline} Upon
entering office[, [Laar's economic knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}
[consisted of [one book]{.mark}: 20th century free market economist
Milton Friedman's Free to Choose, [a]{.mark} personal [statement
advocating for the **immense value of economic
freedom.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The young [p]{.mark}rime [m]{.mark}inister was [so impressed]{.mark}
that [he implemented]{.mark} many of [Friedman's ideas]{.mark}, such as
[free markets and free trade]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather than borrowing
huge amounts of money from international institutions, Estonia sought to
attract foreign investment. [The most northern Baltic nation prioritized
real, natural growth over shallow, artificial growth. Because of this,
[Estonia]{.mark} successfully [transitioned]{.mark} from a
poverty-stricken nation with a planned economy [to]{.mark} a
[flourishing capitalist society]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, by the
latter half of the 1990s, Estonia received more foreign investment per
capita than any other central or eastern European country. [Therefore,
because of free markets and private investment --- not central planning
and public intervention --- [new workplaces formed, old
factories]{.mark} were [reconstructed]{.mark} and new knowledge and
technology were acquired, [mak]{.mark}ing [Estonia authentically modern
and increasingly competitive.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In 1992, Estonia's GDP per capita (in dollars) was \$2,823. In only 20
years, GDP per capita increased dramatically, totaling \$17,041 in
2012.]{.underline}

[Leaving Estonia and [entering China]{.mark}, one will find [more
corroboration for]{.mark} the case for [economic
freedom.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Globally, [[capitalism]{.mark} is [responsible for lifting]{.mark}
nearly [one billion individuals out of poverty]{.mark} in the past 20
years alone. China is responsible for three-fourths of this
achievement]{.underline}. Moreover, extreme poverty is disappearing.
[Between 1981 and 2010, [China elevated 680 million people out of
poverty]{.mark} and [reduced]{.mark} its extreme [poverty rate]{.mark}
from [84 percent]{.mark} in 1980 [to 10 percent]{.mark}
today.]{.underline}

[Like Estonia, [China]{.mark} has [experienced]{.mark} great [economic
liberalization]{.mark}]{.underline} leading to a vast influx of foreign
investment --- [producing remarkable domestic growth and
opportunity.]{.underline}

As evidently displayed in practice, [[nations]{.mark} that have [focused
on economic freedom]{.mark}, such as Estonia and China, have
[significantly grown and developed]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Regimes that
focus purely on abstract and utopian ideology]{.underline}, as those of
Soviet Russia and Maoist China did, [fail to provide true progress and
sustainability.]{.underline}

[As Friedman once said, "[**A society that puts equality before freedom
will get neither. A society that puts freedom before equality will get a
high degree of both**."]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Capitalism is the only working system -- no alternative

smarx, HHW\]

[The [past three years]{.mark} have [seen]{.mark} the [most]{.mark}
concerted [questioning of]{.mark} the merits of [capitalism]{.mark}
since the Great Depression.]{.underline} [The [global]{.mark} financial
[crisis destroyed trillions]{.mark} of dollars of wealth and left
taxpayers on the hook for vast losses accumulated by banks]{.underline}.
In many countries, that debt will not be repaid for generations. The
[economic [downturn left millions without work]{.mark} in North America
and western Europe. Unemployment rates on both sides of the Atlantic
remain near double digits.]{.underline}

Little wonder [there has been a deluge of criticism of what came to be
seen as the best way to organise an economy]{.underline}: the
deregulated, open, privatised and market-focused approach that spread
from English-speaking countries to much of the world after 1980.

The global financial crisis revealed deep flaws in our contemporary
version of capitalism - in particular the instability and excesses it
can generate. But [[nobody]{.mark} has [proposed any credible
alternative]{.mark} model of economic organisation]{.underline}. The
huge public debt created by the global financial crisis will only be
paid off when there has been enough private sector wealth created to pay
the taxes to repay it.

While many called for changes to regulation, [[nobody argues]{.mark} the
[fundamentals of]{.mark} liberal [capitalism]{.mark} - price signals,
free exchange, open markets [- be replaced]{.mark} with central planning
or centralised resource allocation.]{.underline}

While some question the relative weight societies place on economic and
non-economic objectives, nobody (other than the deepest-green greens)
argues material prosperity doesn\'t matter. **[[Growth remains]{.mark}
the [best]{.mark} known [remedy for poverty]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

And while many argued for governments to temporarily step in when
private confidence and activity were weak, [[nobody can deny]{.mark} one
lesson from the downturn is [there are limits to what
governments]{.mark} (and government borrowing) [can
achieve.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In the end, [[capitalism]{.mark} is [the only viable system]{.mark} we
have for organising our economy. [It]{.mark}]{.underline} alone
[[harnesses]{.mark} the reality of [human nature]{.mark} - our continual
striving for progress [and]{.mark} our [competitive
instincts]{.mark}]{.underline} to do our best[. [It]{.mark} alone [is
compatible with]{.mark} political and [democratic freedoms]{.mark}. And
it [alone has proven results]{.mark} [- **advances in**]{.mark}
**material [wellbeing]{.mark} over sustained periods, [lifting]{.mark}
hundreds of [millions]{.mark} of our fellow humans [out of]{.mark}
grinding [poverty]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[Humans are curious, competitive and infinitely varied. The [genius of
capitalism]{.mark} is it disaggregates power and decision-making,
[allow]{.mark}ing [people]{.mark} to [choose their own
road]{.mark}]{.underline}. These different priorities, choices, ideas
and values **[[allow humanity]{.mark} as a whole [to
progress]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Adam Smith famously observed that unfettered individual self-interest
was collectively beneficial: \"**[[By pursuing his own interest,
he]{.mark} frequently [promotes]{.mark} that of the [society more
effectually]{.mark} than when he intends to promote it.\"]{.underline}**

[We need [only think about how difficult]{.mark} it was for [centrally
planned economies]{.mark} such as the former Soviet Union before 1991 or
China before 1978 (or Cuba to this day), to [foster innovation]{.mark}
and growth to understand the role of economic incentives and freedoms in
progress.]{.underline}

**[[A]{.mark} green-energy [transition is]{.mark}]{.underline}** at

unemployment and increase]{.mark} societal and geopolitical
[tensions]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Inaction is also not an option: in the mid-to-long term, those same
countries risk losing competitive advantage through a higher cost of
carbon, reduced resilience, failure to keep up with technological
innovation and limited leverage in trade agreements.

To complicate matters further, the hasty adoption of new environmental
policies and technologies could have unintended consequences for nature
and there are still many unknown risks from deploying untested
biotechnical and geoengineering technologies.

Additionally, a lack of public support for land use transitions or new
pricing schemes risks creating political complications that further slow
action.

Geopolitical risks

**[These [new uncertainties about achieving energy security]{.mark} and
equity whilst transitioning to renewables [represent a]{.mark} mounting
[risk of a disorderly]{.mark} climate [transition]{.mark}, slowed by
social, political and economic complexities]{.underline}**.

It is an intricate set of dynamics that risks creating a kaleidoscope of
energy-transition trajectories, each with different speeds and
complications.

**[[If there is]{.mark} [a]{.mark} sustained [lack of

[see]{.mark} profound geopolitical implications, with [rising
friction]{.mark}]{.underline}** between strong decarbonisation advocates
[and]{.mark} those who oppose quick, decisive action.

**[A transition that fails to account for societal implications may only
exacerbate [inequalities]{.mark}]{.underline}** within and between

#### There is no revolution

In disciplinary and industrial society, system-preserving power was
repressive. Factory workers were brutally exploited by factory owners.
Such violent exploitation of others' labor entailed acts of protest and
resistance. There, it was possible for a revolution to topple the
standing relations of production. In that system of repression, both the
oppressors and the oppressed were visible. There was a concrete opponent
--- a visible enemy ---and one could offer resistance. **[[The
neoliberal system]{.mark} of domination [has a]{.mark} wholly [different
structure]{.mark}. Now, [system-preserving power]{.mark} no longer
[works through repression]{.mark}, but through seduction]{.underline}**
--- **[that is, it leads us astray]{.underline}**. It is no longer
visible, as was the case under the regime of discipline. Now, **[there
is no longer a concrete opponent]{.underline}**, no enemy suppressing
freedom that one might resist. Neoliberalism turns the oppressed worker
into a free contractor, an entrepreneur of the self. Today, **[[everyone
is]{.mark} a [self-exploiting]{.mark} worker]{.underline}** in their own
enterprise. **[Every individual is [master]{.mark} [and slave in
one]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This also means that class struggle has
become an internal struggle with oneself. Today, anyone who fails to
succeed blames themselves and feels ashamed**[. People see themselves,
not society, as the problem]{.underline}**. The subjugated subject is
not even aware of its subjugation Any disciplinary power that expends
effort to force human beings into a straitjacket of commandments and
prohibitions proves inefficient. **[It is significantly more efficient
to ensure that people subordinate themselves to domination on their
own.]{.underline}** The efficacy defining the system today stems from
the fact that, instead of operating through prohibition and privation,
it aims to please and fulfill. Instead of making people compliant, it
endeavors to make them dependent. **[[This logic]{.mark} of neoliberal
efficiency also [holds for surveillance]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In the
1980s, to cite one example, there were vehement protests against the
German national census. Even schoolchildren took to the streets. From
today's perspective, the information requested therein--- profession,
education levels, and distance from the workplace --- seem almost
laughable. At the time, people believed that they were facing the state
as an instance of domination wresting data from citizens against their
will. That time is long past. **[Today, people expose themselves
willingly]{.underline}**. Precisely this sense of freedom is what makes
protest impossible. In contrast to the days of the census, hardly anyone
protests against surveillance. Free self-disclosure and self-exposure
follow the same logic of efficiency as free self-exploitation. What is
there to protest against? Oneself? Conceptual artist Jenny Holzer has
formulated the paradox of the present situation: "Protect me from what I
want**[." It is important to distinguish between power that posits and
power that preserves]{.underline}**. Today, power that maintains the
system assumes a "smart" and friendly guise. In so doing, it makes
itself invisible and unassailable. The subjugated subject does not even
recognize that it has been subjugated. The subject thinks she is free.
This mode of domination neutralizes resistance quite effectively.
**[[Domination]{.mark} that [represses and attacks]{.mark}
[freedom]{.mark} is not stable. [The]{.mark} neoliberal [regime proves
stable by immunizing itself against]{.mark} all
[resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}**, because it makes use of freedom
instead of repressing it. **[Suppressing freedom quickly provokes
resistance; exploiting freedom does not]{.underline}**. After the Asian
financial crisis, South Korea stood paralyzed and shocked. The IMF
intervened and extended credit. In return, the government had to assert
its neoliberal agenda by force. This was repressive, positing power ---
the kind that often proves violent and differs from system-preserving
power, which manages to pass itself off as freedom. According to Naomi
Klein, the state of social shock following catastrophes such as **[the
financial crisis in South Korea --- or the current crisis in Greece ---
offers the chance to radically reprogram society by
force.]{.underline}** Today, there is hardly any resistance in South
Korea. Quite the opposite: a vast consensus prevails --- as well as
depression and burnout. South Korea now has the world's highest suicide
rate. People enact violence on themselves instead of seeking to change
society. **[[Aggression directed outward]{.mark}, which would entail
revolution, [has]{.mark} [yielded to aggression directed inward]{.mark},
against oneself.]{.underline}** Today, no collaborative, networked
multitude exists that might rise up in a global mass of protest and
revolution. Instead, the prevailing mode of production is based on
lonesome and isolated self-entrepreneurs, who are also estranged from
themselves. **[Companies used to compete with each other. Within each
enterprise, however, solidarity could occur.]{.underline}** Today,
everyone is competing against everyone else --- and within the same
enterprise, too. Even though such competition heightens productivity by
leaps and bounds, it destroys solidarity and communal spirit. No
revolutionary mass can arise from exhausted, depressive, and isolated
individuals**[. [Neoliberalism cannot be explained]{.mark} in Marxist
terms. The famous "[alienation]{.mark}" of labor [does
n]{.mark}o[t]{.mark} even [occur]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Today, we dive
eagerly into work --- until we burn out. **[The first stage of burnout
syndrome, after all, is euphoria.]{.underline}** **[[Burnout and
revolution are mutually exclusive]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Accordingly,
it is mistaken to believe that the Multitude will cast off the parasitic
Empire to inaugurate a communist society.

#### Movements don't lead to revolution -- typically non-violent 

**Tooze**, 20**21** (Adam, PhD, LPE@Columbia, Ecological Leninism Adam
Tooze on Andreas Malm's post-pandemic climate politics 11-18.
[https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n22/adam-tooze/ecological-leninism
///](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n22/adam-tooze/ecological-leninism%20///)
MF)

It is against the backdrop of this portrait of societies in deadlock
that we should read Malm's latest provocation, How to Blow up a
Pipeline. Though the book makes a general argument for militant action
it is best understood as an intervention at a specific conjuncture. The
German movement Ende Gelände, whose protests Malm participated in, had
remarkable success between 2015 and 2018 in mobilising direct action
against Germany's brown coal mines and smoke-belching power stations.
[[But the movement suffered a serious setback when the Merkel government
stitched up a deal with the coal industry and trade unions to delay the
exit from coal until 2038,]{.mark} a ridiculous horizon entirely out of
line even with the modest commitments of the Paris Agreement. This was a
turning point for the climate movement in Germany.]{.underline}

The militant activists of Ende Gelände had been trained in the direct
action techniques of the anti-nuclear movement, but now it was the
mobilisation of schoolchildren, inspired by Greta Thunberg and Fridays
for Future, that led the way. A school strike 1.4 million strong -- the
largest co-ordinated youth protest in history -- took place on 15 March
2019. This was closely followed by a series of protests across the UK by
Extinction Rebellion. By September 2019, the Friday strike movement
numbered four million protesters worldwide, a third of them in Germany.
[But to the frustration of Malm and many in the Ende Gelände movement,
Fridays for Future showed [no interest in direct action. The protesting
schoolchildren stuck to the tradition of noisy street
demonstrations]{.mark}. In the UK, as Malm observes, XR followed [recent
mobilisations in the US by positioning itself against violent
action.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The question that drives How to Blow up a Pipeline is why the new
movements of protest in 2019, [despite their scale and dynamism, refused
to adopt the techniques of physical obstruction and disruption]{.mark}
successfully modelled by Ende Gelände. Part of the answer is moral.
The US movement, in particular, [has imbibed a commitment to non-violent
methods]{.mark}. Some argued that attacks on property would only produce
a painful and repressive backlash, and indeed, this summer, Jessica
Reznicek, who with Ruby Montoya mounted a sabotage campaign against the
Dakota Access pipeline, was sentenced to eight years in federal
prison]{.underline}. But, as Malm argues, these familiar tactical
concerns have been reinforced in the current phase of the climate
movement by a peculiar reading of history, in which the power of
self-control and non-violence is fetishised. The new movements, he
writes, look to 'historical precedents -- people winning against
hopeless odds, great evil suddenly put to an end -- that can break the
hold of apathy':

If they could prevail, the reasoning goes, so can we. If they changed
the world by all means but violent ones, so we shall save it. Analogism
has become a prime mode of argumentation and the main source of
strategic thinking, most visibly in XR, the rare organisation that
defines itself as a result of historical study. Note that the argument
is not that violence would be bad at this particular moment -- say,
because the level of class struggle is so low in the global North that
adventurist actions would only rebound and suppress it further: words
that would never pass XR lips -- nor that it might be expedient only
under conditions of severe repression. Instead, analogist strategic
pacifism holds that violence is bad in all settings, because this is
what history shows. Success belongs to the peaceful. The roster of
historical analogies begins with slavery.

[[Popular authors and international organizations recommend
transformation to a 'new economy'. However, this is misleadingly
interpreted as radical or revolutionary. Two problematic positions are
revealed: being pro-growth while seeking to change the current form of
capitalism]{.mark} (e.g. Ha-Joon Chang[), and being anti-growth on
environmental grounds but promoting growth for poverty alleviation and
due to agnosticism about growt]{.mark}h (e.g. Tim Jackson and Kate
Raworth). [Both positions involve contradictions and an evident failure
to address, or perhaps even a denial of, the actual operations of
capital accumulating economies]{.mark}. Thus, economists ostensibly
critical of capitalism turn out to be apologists for growth who conform
to the requirements of a top-down passive revolution, that leaves power
relations undisturbed and the economic structure fundamentally
unchanged.]{.underline} The growth economy is shown to include
technocracy, productivism associated with eugenics, inequity disguised
as meritocracy, competition concealing militarism and imperialism,
imposition of development as progress, and financialization and
commodification of Nature.

#### Alt fails -- their author misquotes Lenin and replacement isn't possible (Dean and Heron)

rs21,
https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/,
SMarx, JTong\]

The diversity of perspectives on Lenin found among these authors
necessarily poses a question -- **[what exactly is ecological
Leninism]{.underline}**? By looking at each of their accounts, it
becomes clear that **[each writer finds something different within the
corpus of Leninism]{.underline}**. Furthermore, **[there is much to
still be developed if ecological Leninism is to grow into a distinct
approach to planetary breakdown]{.underline}**. Given the development of
such a system of thought will require more than one author or piece,
this article aims to reflect on several concerns which may become the
bedrock of an ecological Leninism: the state, the party and movements,
imperialism, and the philosophical underpinnings of Leninist
materialism. The arrival of an ecological Leninism ultimately presents
an opportunity to build on the analysis of ecological Marxists concerned
with metabolisms and similar accounts of capitalism, and to concern
ourselves with organising for revolutionary change.

The state of the party -- Dean and Heron

Starting with **[[Dean and Heron]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s account,
ecological Leninism is crucial to challenging dead ends in the
environmental movement's strategies. To do this, they **[[attempt to
disentangle]{.mark} the [contradictions present within the variety of
contemporary]{.mark}]{.underline}** Green New Deal
(**[[GND]{.underline}]{.mark}**) proposals. In general terms, these aim
through state-led investment to repurpose national economies towards
decarbonisation and redistributive policies. Surveying plans from either
side of the Atlantic, Dean and Heron point out that many GNDs still
refuse to nationalise the industries necessary for large-scale
decarbonisation. Furthermore, **[they point out that many retain a
nationalist politics of growth, focused on creating new industries which
may provide opportunities for employment, ignoring the continued
extraction from the global majority such proposals seem to
require.]{.underline}**

**[Many GND organisers recognise these contradictions but adopted an
attitude of critical support]{.underline}**, particularly while the
Sanders and Corbyn movements were seeking election on GND platforms.
Dean and Heron don't advocate complete rejection, nor a falling in line
with a social-democratic GND. Instead **[[they argue we need to organise
for revolutionary socialism whilst recognising the necessity of seizing
control of the state for decarbonisation]{.underline}]{.mark}** implicit
within many left-wing GNDs. Or as they phrase it -- 'stripping the
policy's reformist content away from its revolutionary form.' In their
view, the GND's image of the state being used to finally confront the
global emissions crisis requires a revolutionary leap which takes it
away from its often-limited policy content.

By thinking through these issues around the GND, **[[Dean and Heron
affirm the need for environmentalists to abandon 'state phobia' and
seriously engage with the possibility of a 'state-led, centrally
planned, and global response' to the climate crisis]{.mark}---the 'old'
Leninist revolutionary seizure of state power]{.underline}**. **[[They
end by arguing for the need to build a revolutionary Leninist
party]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which is **[willing to seize the state for
the working class and to use this apparatus to tackle climate
breakdown]{.underline}**. For Dean and Heron then, ecological Leninism
centres on party building and the seizure of the state.

**[[There is much to disagree]{.mark} with in their
interpretation]{.underline}**. Most notably, **[[in their argument for
the importance of the state, they point to an extract where Lenin states
the 'apparatus must not, and should not, be
smashed']{.underline}]{.mark}**, \[4\] **[[using this to suggest the
importance of seizing the state for a top down centralized response to
climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As Gareth Dale has pointed out,
**[[their use of Lenin's argument against wrecking the state is a
serious misquoting]{.underline}]{.mark}**. \[5\] If one reviews the
quotation, the apparatus in question which Lenin is talking about is the
particular 'accounting apparatus' in the form of the state bank and
similar bodies. Despite the use of this quote to side-line wrecking,
there is still the issue of smashing the rest of the state apparatus and
its replacement. **[What is left [underexplored in this
article]{.mark}]{.underline}** by Dean and Heron, though they certainly
believe in it, **[[is this difficult task of replacing the bourgeois
state with the dictatorship of the proletariat]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Herein we encounter a conundrum of ecological Leninism -- how do we
square the need for rapid changes to tackle climate change with the
simultaneous need to smash the state and replace it with organs of
workers' control]{.underline}?**

#### Alt fails -- movements aren't strong or sufficient (Malm)

**Woody 20** \[Gus Woody, 12-18-2020, \"Revolutionary Reflections,\"

War communism -- Malm

This leads us to **[[Malm, whose ecological Leninism is focused
predominantly on the period of War Communism and the struggles of the
early Bolshevik regime to establish itself]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Rather than Roosevelt's New Deal period in the 1930s, to which GND
organisers look for historical analogy, **[Malm [argues]{.mark}
[decarbonisation]{.mark} [would look more akin to the War
Communism]{.mark} of the 1920s]{.underline}**. Here, the Bolsheviks were
surrounded by both imperialist powers and the forces of capital, as well
as considering how to transform production. **[[Today, any attempt at
staving off climate breakdown will require a fight against fossil
capitalists and imperialist states keen to
pollute]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as well as the struggle to wrest control
of production.

In Corona, Climate, Chronic Emergency **[Malm identifies three
principles of Ecological Leninism as a political project]{.underline}**.
Firstly, 'turning the crisis of symptoms into a crisis of the causes.'
In simple terms, just as the Bolsheviks sought to turn the imperialist
World War One into a crisis for capitalism more generally, **[[today
ecological Leninism requires turning the chronic emergencies of climate
disaster and zoonotic diseases into a general crisis for the capitalist
system]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the face of escalating symptoms, there
is a need to rapidly build for a revolutionary preservation of life.

**[This leads to the second principle of ecological Leninism -- 'speed
as paramount virtu]{.underline}**e.' **[We all know the 12 years to
avert climate catastrophe projection made by the IPCC 1.5 report two
years ago.]{.underline}** If the atmosphere is like a bathtub rapidly
filling with carbon which will remain there unless removed,
**[ecological Leninism understands the urgency of reducing and
ultimately reaching negative emissions; it demands revolutionaries who
understand every second counts in the fight against
barbarism.]{.underline}**

Finally, **[Malm argues that the last principle of ecological
Leninism,]{.underline}** in a similar vein to Dean and Heron,
**[consists of leaping 'at any opportunity to wrest the state in this
direction' and turn society away from catastrophe towards direct public
control.]{.underline}** Crucially, his vision of this is not in line
with the more optimistic vision of progressive GND proposals, or 'luxury
Communisms'. Instead, the idea of War Communism, of the Bolshevik state
attempting to lead a transformation of Russian society whilst facing
war, famine, and fuel shortage, reflects the sort of dire circumstances
that any ecological Leninist regime would face. Attempting to mitigate
and adapt will not be pretty, it may bring emancipation but will be hard
work in difficult conditions. Here, Malm's argument resembles similar
sentiments expressed by Salvage's editorial collective:

**[The earth]{.underline}** the wretched would -- will -- inherit,
**[will be in need of an assiduous programme of
restoration.]{.underline}** While we may yearn for luxury, what will be
necessary first is Salvage Communism. \[6\]

In this Communism, caught between salvage and war, Malm goes further
than Dean and Heron. Where their arguments against state-phobia lead
them towards the necessity of the state apparatus' growth, **[[Malm
rejects the Leninist doctrine of demolishing and replacing the state
altogether]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In his words -- 'all we have to work
with is the dreary bourgeois state, tethered to the circuits of capital
as always.'

**[[War Communism here shifts to a violent
pessimism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, where all we can do is mobilise a
variety of strategies to cut these tethers. **[[Malm seems deeply
sceptical about the possibility of the formation of alternative
institutions of dual power]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[Ecological]{.underline}** **[Leninism]{.underline}**, contra Dean and
Heron, **[need]{.underline}** **[not imply a party or 'any actual
Leninist formations capable of seizing power and implementing the
correct measures.']{.underline}** **[The possibility -- the urgent
necessity]{.underline}** -- of building such formations **[is not really
discussed]{.underline}**, **[despite the very same pages recognising
that these years of chronic emergency 'can be expected to usher in
pronounced political volatility.']{.underline}**

**[[Malm attempts to have his 'Lenin cake' and eat it: he argues
ecological Leninism should raise the consciousness of spontaneous
movements and route them towards the drivers of breakdown, whilst he
avoids really discussing how to approach Leninist organisation and the
formation of working class power to rival the state.]{.mark}
[Malm]{.mark} [falls into the trap]{.mark} [of creating a dichotomy
between waiting for revolution and acting within existing social
movements to pressure the bourgeoise
state]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The possibility of working class
agency that bucks these two categories is foreclosed.

**[This points to an absence at the heart of Malm's ecological
Leninism]{.underline}**. It is a Leninism without a revolution of 1917,
focused instead on the difficulties of the Bolshevik government during
the Civil War and on Lenin's wagers during the First World War. It has
little to say about the act of building movements capable of intervening
in revolutionary situations, tipping them towards revolutionary
outcomes. At the same time, as Tugal has eloquently pointed out,
**[[Malm's ecological Leninism is without a revolutionary
subject]{.underline}]{.mark}**. \[7\] **[Rarely in his book does
[Malm]{.mark} speak of the role of working class struggle within any
ecological Leninist project, and as a result he [seems pessimistic about
the formation of working class power which could rival the
state]{.mark}]{.underline}**, laying the bedrock for a Leninist project.
As Max Ajl points out:

One thumbs in vain through this book for any mention of the people who
are not hypothetical, who are struggling in small, desperate, sincere,
and hopeful ways for a better world. On this big, beautiful, desperate,
poor, devastated planet are **[[there no social forces which meet Malm's
standards for the subject or agent of ecological revolution or
ecological Leninism]{.underline}]{.mark}**? \[8\]

Ultimately, [**[if climate Leninists are to retain the desire to smash
and replace the bourgeois state,]{.underline}** **[there is a need to
analyse how actually existing working class and peasant movements may
organise]{.underline}**]{.mark} to build the institutions necessary for
a situation of dual power. The question is how to build these bodies
whilst simultaneously mobilising for maximum climate action in the
present. **[[Malm's]{.underline}]{.mark}** otherwise engaging
[**[work]{.underline}** **[requires these insights to flesh out a
programme of ecological Leninism suitable]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[for
our times.]{.underline}**

state for the working class and to use this apparatus to tackle climate
breakdown. For Dean and Heron then, ecological Leninism centres on party
building and the seizure of the state.]{.underline}

There is much to disagree with in their interpretation. Most notably, in
their argument for the importance of the state, they point to an extract
where Lenin states the 'apparatus must not, and should not, be
smashed', [\[4\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn4) using
this to suggest the importance of seizing the state for a top down
centralized response to climate change. As Gareth Dale has pointed out,
their use of Lenin's argument against wrecking the state is a serious
misquoting. [\[5\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn5) If
one reviews the quotation, the apparatus in question which Lenin is
talking about is the particular 'accounting apparatus' in the form of
the state bank and similar bodies. Despite the use of this quote to
side-line wrecking, there is still the issue of smashing the rest of the
state apparatus and its replacement. What is left underexplored in this
article by Dean and Heron, though they certainly believe in it, is this
difficult task of replacing the bourgeois state with the dictatorship of
the proletariat.

Herein we encounter a conundrum of ecological Leninism -- how do we
square the need for rapid changes to tackle climate change with the
simultaneous need to smash the state and replace it with organs of
workers' control?

War communism -- Malm

[This leads us to [Malm, whose ecological Leninism is focused
predominantly on the period of War Communism and the struggles of the
early Bolshevik regime to establish itself]{.mark}.]{.underline} Rather
than Roosevelt's New Deal period in the 1930s, to which GND organisers
look for historical analogy, Malm argues decarbonisation would look more
akin to the War Communism of the 1920s. Here, the Bolsheviks were
surrounded by both imperialist powers and the forces of capital, as well
as considering how to transform production. Today, any attempt at
staving off climate breakdown will require a fight against fossil
capitalists and imperialist states keen to pollute, as well as the
struggle to wrest control of production.

In [Corona, Climate, Chronic Emergency Malm identifies three principles
of Ecological Leninism as a political project.]{.underline} Firstly,
'turning the crisis of symptoms into a crisis of the causes.' In simple
terms, just as the Bolsheviks sought to turn the imperialist World War
One into a crisis for capitalism more generally, today ecological
Leninism requires turning the chronic emergencies of climate disaster
and zoonotic diseases into a general crisis for the capitalist system.
In the face of escalating symptoms, there is a need to rapidly build for
a revolutionary preservation of life.

[This leads to the second principle of ecological Leninism -- 'speed as
paramount virtue.']{.underline} We all know the 12 years to avert
climate catastrophe projection made by the IPCC 1.5 report two years
ago. If the atmosphere is like a bathtub rapidly filling with carbon
which will remain there unless removed, ecological Leninism understands
the urgency of reducing and ultimately reaching negative emissions; it
demands revolutionaries who understand every second counts in the fight
against barbarism.

[Finally, Malm argues that the last principle of ecological Leninism, in
a similar vein to Dean and Heron, consists of leaping 'at any
opportunity to wrest the state in this direction' and turn society away
from catastrophe towards direct public control.]{.underline} Crucially,
his vision of this is not in line with the more optimistic vision of
progressive GND proposals, or 'luxury Communisms'. Instead, the idea of
War Communism, of the Bolshevik state attempting to lead a
transformation of Russian society whilst facing war, famine, and fuel
shortage, reflects the sort of dire circumstances that any ecological
Leninist regime would face. Attempting to mitigate and adapt will not be
pretty, it may bring emancipation but will be hard work in difficult
conditions. Here, Malm's argument resembles similar sentiments expressed
by Salvage's editorial collective:

The earth the wretched would -- will -- inherit, will be in need of an
assiduous programme of restoration. While we may yearn for luxury, what
will be necessary first is Salvage
Communism. [\[6\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn6)

[In this Communism, caught between salvage and war, Malm goes further
than Dean and Heron. Where their arguments against state-phobia lead
them towards the necessity of the state apparatus' growth, Malm rejects
the Leninist doctrine of demolishing and replacing the state
altogether.]{.underline} In his words -- 'all we have to work with is
the dreary bourgeois state, tethered to the circuits of capital as
always.'

War Communism here shifts to a violent pessimism, where all we can do is
mobilise a variety of strategies to cut these tethers. Malm seems deeply
sceptical about the possibility of the formation of alternative
institutions of dual power. Ecological Leninism, contra Dean and Heron,
need not imply a party or 'any actual Leninist formations capable of
seizing power and implementing the correct measures.' The possibility --
the urgent necessity -- of building such formations is not really
discussed, despite the very same pages recognising that these years of
chronic emergency 'can be expected to usher in pronounced political
volatility.'

Malm attempts to have his 'Lenin cake' and eat it: he argues ecological
Leninism should raise the consciousness of spontaneous movements and
route them towards the drivers of breakdown, whilst he avoids really
discussing how to approach Leninist organisation and the formation of
working class power to rival the state. Malm falls into the trap of
creating a dichotomy between waiting for revolution and acting within
existing social movements to pressure the bourgeoise state. The
possibility of working class agency that bucks these two categories is
foreclosed.

This points to an absence at the heart of Malm's ecological Leninism. It
is a Leninism without a revolution of 1917, focused instead on the
difficulties of the Bolshevik government during the Civil War and on
Lenin's wagers during the First World War. It has little to say about
the act of building movements capable of intervening in revolutionary
situations, tipping them towards revolutionary outcomes. At the same
time, as Tugal has eloquently pointed out, Malm's ecological Leninism is
without a revolutionary
subject. [\[7\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn7) Rarely
in his book does Malm speak of the role of working class struggle within
any ecological Leninist project, and as a result he seems pessimistic
about the formation of working class power which could rival the state,
laying the bedrock for a Leninist project. As Max Ajl points out:

One thumbs in vain through this book for any mention of the people who
are not hypothetical, who are struggling in small, desperate, sincere,
and hopeful ways for a better world. On this big, beautiful, desperate,
poor, devastated planet are there no social forces which meet Malm's
standards for the subject or agent of ecological revolution or
ecological
Leninism? [\[8\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn8)

[[Ultimately, if climate Leninists are to retain the desire to smash and
replace the bourgeois state, there is a need to analyse how actually
existing working class and peasant movements may organise to build the
institutions necessary for a situation of dual
power]{.mark}.]{.underline} The question is how to build these bodies
whilst simultaneously mobilising for maximum climate action in the
present. Malm's otherwise engaging work requires these insights to flesh
out a programme of ecological Leninism suitable for our times.

Building the base -- Wall

[Wall's writings on Lenin and the environmental movement might be seen
as filling this gap in Malm's work.]{.underline} In his recent Climate
Strike and in other writings, Leninist strategic thinking is
central. [\[9\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn9) In
particular, the necessity of building bases of working class power, seen
as essential preconditions of dual power. Wall's is a practical account
of Lenin; it looks to the ways in which Leninist thinking suggest
revolutionaries should organise in the here and now.

In Climate Strike, [[Wall argues for a focus on building grassroots
institutions that enable working class communities to come together --
tenants unions, local food sovereignty groups, and
more]{.underline}]{.mark}. Contra Dean and Heron's need for a party,
contra Malm's need for speed, [Wall argues for the slow construction of
spaces of working class power]{.underline}. There are no shortcuts to
revolution, and Wall argues this to its limit.

[Wall's ecological Leninism is focused on creating collectives able to
oppose capitalism and the state, as well as adapt to climate change's
effects.]{.underline} Let us take tenants organising as an example of
this 'base-building.' By organising renters, it creates a new formation
of working class power capable of resisting landlords as well as
producing a core of individuals who have grown in both militancy and
organising skill. As these institutions grow, not only do they hopefully
build a base of working class revolutionaries, but they create spaces
where the working class can come together to discuss how climate change
and capitalism effects their housing. The ideal situation is that
through the long work of building these institutions it lays the bedrock
of working class alternates to the state necessary for the Leninist
project. Wall thus rejects the binary between revolution today or
popular pressure on reformist institutions, arguing for the constant
need to build for revolution.

There is still much work to be done on this particular aspect of
ecological Leninism, not least because Wall often insists on applying it
with the Green Party in view, despite the class composition of its
supporters and its refusal to identify working class self-activity as
the vehicle of revolutionary change. Furthermore, as Holmes has argued,
Wall fails to specify the context under which this strategy could be
adopted. This results in an elasticity to the concept of base-building,
which allows it to become a hold-all term for any form of community
organising.

Whilst Wall has a slower conception of ecological Leninism, focused on
the hard slog of organising, it doesn't entirely repudiate the need for
urgent action, which requires more specificity around the practicalities
of building for dual power over the coming years. A strategy geared to
base-building risks becoming a new form of economism, as Lenin might
have put it. There is a balance that must be struck, but Wall's
intervention is crucial in pointing to the dearth of institutions here
in the UK at least which could be considered bases of working class
power.

Three shades of Ecological Leninism

[[Each of these authors reads Lenin in different ways. Dean and Heron
emphasise the party and state, Malm for speed and struggle under
conditions of hardship, Wall for constant strategic organising. Each has
shortcomings, but all are contributing to a useful development of---or
rupture in---ecological theory and practice.]{.underline}]{.mark}

How should we reconsider Lenin's corpus in these bad times? Just as John
Bellamy Foster and others have excavated the concept of the metabolic
rift from
Marx, [\[10\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn10) is
there a conceptual well to be found untapped in Lenin? I think not. It
is not enough to find some kernel of an ecological worldview in Lenin,
as much as his devotees love to talk of his reverence for
nature. [\[11\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn11) If
Leninism is an attempt to put theory into practice, the same must apply
to its ecological variant. Ecological Leninism must be more than a
theoretical extension of ecological Marxism, it must indicate the
practices which a revolutionary eco-socialist movement are to adopt.
Crucially, it also requires getting involved in actually existing
movements, as there is no such thing as armchair Leninism.

To kick the glass case off Lenin's corpse, dust him off, and dip him in
green paint is hardly enough. [If we are to not only build Leninism, but
an ecological programme aimed at tackling the climate crisis, a
synthesis must be achieved between Lenin's thought and other relevant
thinkers on Marxism and ecology. The pieces I've discussed above leave
open the construction of many aspects of such a programme. Malm, Dean
and Heron, and Wall have opened the space by which we may move towards
it.]{.underline}

To begin developing a wider conception of ecological Leninism, to build
on the excellent interventions of these authors, I wish to suggest
several areas of Lenin's thought which might be worth reinterrogating
with an ecological view -- the state, the relationship between movement,
workers, and party, the centrality of imperialism, and finally wider
concerns for the philosophy of nature and science. The elaboration and
development of Marxist ecology in these areas may provide the bedrock
for a revolutionary ecosocialist movement, and it should certainly not
be left to one writer. As a result, the following is an attempt to
indicate potential directions of travel that will build on Malm, Dean
and Heron, and Wall, and hopefully furnish our society with something
that can face the coming crisis.

#### Ecological Leninism can't solve for climate change 

**Woody**, 20**20** (Gus. "Revolutionary Reflections: Moving towards an

https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/
///MF)

[Given the necessity of systemic change in the face of climate
breakdown, it was only a matter of time before thinkers would look to
the Russian revolution for insights. Over the last year, [ecological
Leninism has burst onto the scene in the works of several
authors]{.mark}.]{.underline} Andreas Malm's latest book Corona,
Climate, Chronic Emergency focuses on the
concept, [\[1\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn1) Jodi
Dean and Kai Heron have written of a 'climate
Leninism', [\[2\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn2) and
Derek Wall has written of Lenin's importance to environmental movements
in his latest book, Climate
Strike. [\[3\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn3)

The diversity of perspectives on Lenin found among these authors
necessarily poses a question -- what exactly is ecological Leninism? By
looking at each of their accounts, it becomes clear that each writer
finds something different within the corpus of Leninism. Furthermore,
there is much to still be developed if ecological Leninism is to grow
into a distinct approach to planetary breakdown. Given the development
of such a system of thought will require more than one author or piece,
this article aims to reflect on several concerns which may become the
bedrock of an ecological Leninism: the state, the party and movements,
imperialism, and the philosophical underpinnings of Leninist
materialism. The arrival of an ecological Leninism ultimately presents
an opportunity to build on the analysis of ecological Marxists concerned
with metabolisms and similar accounts of capitalism, and to concern
ourselves with organising for revolutionary change.

The state of the party -- Dean and Heron

Starting with Dean and Heron's account, [ecological Leninism is crucial
to challenging dead ends in the environmental movement's
strategies.]{.underline} To do this, they attempt to disentangle the
contradictions present within the variety of contemporary Green New Deal
(GND) proposals. In general terms, these aim through state-led
investment to repurpose national economies towards decarbonisation and
redistributive policies.  Surveying plans from either side of the
Atlantic, Dean and Heron point out that many GNDs still refuse to
nationalise the industries necessary for large-scale decarbonisation.
Furthermore, they point out that many retain a nationalist politics of
growth, focused on creating new industries which may provide
opportunities for employment, ignoring the continued extraction from the
global majority such proposals seem to require.

Many GND organisers recognise these contradictions but adopted an
attitude of critical support, particularly while the Sanders and Corbyn
movements were seeking election on GND platforms. Dean and Heron don't
advocate complete rejection, nor a falling in line with a
social-democratic GND. [Instead they argue we need to organise for
revolutionary socialism whilst recognising the necessity of seizing
control of the state for decarbonisation implicit within many left-wing
GNDs. Or as they phrase it -- 'stripping the policy's reformist content
away from its revolutionary form.' In their view, the GND's image of the
state being used to finally confront the global emissions crisis
requires a revolutionary leap which takes it away from its often-limited
policy content]{.underline}.

By thinking through these issues around the GND, Dean and Heron affirm
the need for environmentalists to abandon 'state phobia' and seriously
engage with the possibility of a 'state-led, centrally planned, and
global response' to the climate crisis---the 'old' Leninist
revolutionary seizure of state power. They end by arguing for the need
to build a revolutionary Leninist party, which is willing to seize the
state for the working class and to use this apparatus to tackle climate
breakdown. For Dean and Heron then, ecological Leninism centres on party
building and the seizure of the state.

[[There is much to disagree with in their interpretation. Most notably,
in their argument for the importance of the state, they point to an
extract where Lenin states the 'apparatus must not, and should not, be
smashed', ]{.underline}]{.mark}[[[\[4\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn4) using
this to suggest the importance of seizing the state for a top down
centralized response to climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} As Gareth Dale has pointed
out, their use of Lenin's argument against wrecking the state is a
serious
misquoting. [\[5\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn5) If
one reviews the quotation, the apparatus in question which Lenin is
talking about is the particular 'accounting apparatus' in the form of
the state bank and similar bodies. Despite the use of this quote to
side-line wrecking, there is still the issue of smashing the rest of the
state apparatus and its replacement. What is left underexplored in this
article by Dean and Heron, though they certainly believe in it, is this
difficult task of replacing the bourgeois state with the dictatorship of
the proletariat.

Herein we encounter a conundrum of ecological Leninism -- how do we
square the need for rapid changes to tackle climate change with the
simultaneous need to smash the state and replace it with organs of
workers' control?

War communism -- Malm

This leads us to Malm, whose ecological Leninism is focused
predominantly on the period of War Communism and the struggles of the
early Bolshevik regime to establish itself. Rather than Roosevelt's New

imperialist powers and the forces of capital, as well as considering how
to transform production. [[Today, any attempt at staving off climate

This leads to the second principle of ecological Leninism -- 'speed as

is like a bathtub rapidly filling with carbon which will remain there

1: The State

A century on from The State and Revolution, the capitalist state which
Lenin spoke of is different in many
ways. [\[12\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn12) Over
the 20th century, countries like the UK saw a massive rise in state
ownership and the provision of services like the NHS. Conversely, since
the 1970s many nations have seen a continued rise in privatisation, with
'public-private partnerships' between business and the state reaching
their sickly zenith in the UK, with the cronyism of key coronavirus
contracts outsourced to the friends and family of Conservative MPs.
[[Furthermore, the rise of global supply chains and new international
bodies for capitalist states to interact has created a world where
states are increasingly entangled and co-dependent, creating challenges
for any revolutionary theory which aims for global
impact]{.mark}. ]{.underline}[[\[13\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn13) There
is therefore [an urgent need to analyse the class nature of modern
capitalist states and identify where and how the revolutionary working
class are best to organise against it]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Luckily, Marxist theorising around the state has not stayed still since
Lenin's day. There has been
Althusser, [\[14\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn14) Gramsci, [\[15\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn15) and
the Miliband-Poulantzas debate about the class character of the
state, [\[16\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn16) as
well as the emergence of Open Marxist
approaches. [\[17\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn17) As
a result, in the words of Khachaturian, 'Marxist state theory is largely
an open-ended and intellectually pluralistic research
framework.' [\[18\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn18) Whilst
I do not intend to comment on these different theories, I wish to point
to certain considerations which suggest the urgency of an ecological
Leninist theory of the state.

[Firstly, the point pushed by both GND proponents and the ecological
Leninist authors already discussed -- the state apparatus has
significant potential to be used as an instrument for rapid
decarbonisation.]{.underline}

However, and this is where previous accounts still have direction to
travel, there is the importance of understanding the state as a product
of irreconcilable class antagonism. With Dean and Heron's article not
exploring the need to wreck the state, and Malm rejecting it outright,
the question of what form proletarian control takes is crucial.
Ecological Leninism requires focus on the transitional stage -- the
dictatorship of the proletariat, which as Lenin stated, 'will create
democracy for the people, for the majority, along with the necessary
suppression of the minority.'

In the period of rapid decarbonisation which ecological Leninism aims to
deliver, there is the twofold problem of creating worker control over
society as well as the difficulty of ensuring the forces of fossil
capital cannot exert influence. On the first, expanding proletarian
democracy, there is much the Leninist tradition must learn from the
Bolshevik experiment and the ways in which traditions of worker control
like council communism have been critical of it. This is a valuable
endeavour if used to move environmentalism away from the liberal
conception of 'climate assemblies' towards climate councils and soviets
of workers. Herein is why Wall and other Marxists' work on base-building
is crucial, as those who seriously talk about building institutions of
worker control. [Ultimately, ecological Leninism means learning from the
failure of previous revolutions in creating institutions capable of
wresting responsibility from the bourgeois state and dismantling it
through practical and theoretical explanations of contemporary struggles
where we see worker control emerging.]{.underline}

[On the second issue of suppression, [socialists must recognise that if
a revolutionary movement seized state power, without continued
international mobilisations, any decarbonisation effort will face new
enemies of global capitalism -- the IMF, the World Bank]{.mark},
etc]{.underline}. Studying how these institutions have been mobilised
against socialist and social democratic states is crucial, as in
addition to imperialist armies and governments, these bodies will attack
any ecological Leninist regime. International eco-socialist solidarity
is crucial, as repression from the enemies of a revolutionary
eco-socialism risks making an ecological Leninist regime an island in a
hostile sea. In this situation, the need for stability in the
transitional period may lead Leninists to not only suppress their
exploiters, but also any left-wing element which demands more from the
regime, becoming a snake eating its own tail. In short, how to prevent
violent autarky whilst regimes build for global eco-socialist revolution
is a pressing issue.

Ultimately, the importance of an ecological Leninist understanding of
the state will be to effectively draw a line between revolutionary
socialists and compromise elements within the wider environmental
movement who need to be won over to the revolutionary
cause.[\[19\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn19) In
the UK and the US, the past years have seen left environmentalists
compromise with movements pursuing election to state power in the hope
of action on the climate crisis. The failure of these movements
indicates the foreclosure of the electoral route to climate action
within bourgeoise state institutions, this demands a reckoning with the
class character of the state. Given the need for Malm's speed as a
paramount virtue, Leninists must build on these experiences to begin
elaborating their own programme's confrontation with the beast that is
the state apparatus.

#### Divisions within the party 

**Woody**, 20**20** (Gus. "Revolutionary Reflections: Moving towards an
ecological Leninism" rs21. December 18, 2020.
https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/
///MF)

[This points to a further urgent issue when moving towards an ecological
Leninism, one that the preceding authors vary on-- the organisation of
revolutionary socialists and its relationships with mass movements. In
particular, the ecological Leninists are split on the question of the
party.]{.underline} Dean and Heron are open in their desire for an
ecological Leninist party, Malm reads ecological Leninism as a
collection of principles not implying an actually existing party, Wall
is focused on the need for grassroots organising rather than any formal
party. This reflects a wider crisis among revolutionary socialists, one
that has extended through the long 20th century into the 21st, that of
the 'Leninist party' and the different organisational models proposed
for revolutionaries.

Outside of Dean and Heron's calls for a party, both Wall's Climate
Strike and Malm's upcoming How to Blow up a Pipeline focus on engaging
with the variety of strategies environmentalists can take to disrupt
fossil capital. [[Whilst both are certain to be crucial contributions,
just as Lenin railed against the economist and terrorist strategies of
simply organising around workplace conflicts or conducting isolated
violent actions, there is still the tricky problem of creating an
organisational form with the strategic acumen to transcend the limits of
both]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Contra Malm, who in Chronic Emergency talks of 'popular pressure brought
to bear' on the state, there is a need to think through how this
'popular pressure' is not co-opted by opportunist forces and remains
revolutionary, international, and eco-socialist in its content and form.
Just as Lenin in What is to be Done? points to the need for Marxists to
organise to ensure that economic struggle is not seen as subservient for
the need to organise and agitate for revolutionary socialism, today
simply hoping for rising radicalism from ecological struggle is
insufficient. Only through attempts to agitate and organise as a body of
revolutionary socialists can these struggles be converted into a
confrontation with fossil capital. But if we reject the reading of Lenin
as party builder, as many contemporary eco-socialists do, where does
this leave us?

Here, there is an urgent need for ecological Leninists to critically
engage with the organisational failures of the groups that have adopted
the Bolshevik banner in the long century since 1917. With a century
where the centralist aspects of democratic centralism have been all too
brutally wielded, now more than ever is a time for the comradely but
disciplined development of revolutionary socialist organisation. Or in
the words of Gittlitz, reflecting on the strange case of the Posadist
International:

The challenge, then, is neither to recreate the revolutionary movements
of the past, nor to totally revise their history, but to salvage the
functional truth of their mission for the struggle
ahead. [\[20\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn20)

It would be remiss of any ecological socialist to ignore the pioneering
work of early anti-capitalist environmentalists like Bookchin, whose
social ecology was deeply critical of Leninist, Trotskyist and other
socialist party formations as they emerged in the
US. [\[21\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn21) Bookchin
of course, was just as comfortable critiquing anarchist organisational
forms, attempting to steer a course between Marxism and Anarchism. Just
as the Paris Commune was instructive to Marx and Lenin, modern
ecological Leninists should consider the organisation of the revolution
and state in Rojava, inspired by Bookchin and
Ocalan. [\[22\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn22) Rojava
contains within it lessons on striking a balance between the need for
direct democracy and having a disciplined cadre, pointing to the many
ways in which these needs are not necessarily contradictory. This is
just one of many 'ecological regimes' which are attempting to grow
today, and they should be used to inspire and develop contemporary
Leninism.

Given the often-rapid nature of rebellion and wider social change, the
difficulty of how any Leninist organisation relates itself to the
spontaneous actions of the working class and other social formations
rears its head. What has prevented analysis of this question in many
quarters is the wider tendency of environmentalists being uncomfortable
using class analysis in proposing key agents for a revolutionary
movement. One of the first eco-socialist thinkers, Andre Gorz, famously
said Farewell to the Working Class, as did Bookchin in his own way
in Listen
Marxist! [\[23\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn23) This
reflected the reality that the 'industrial working class', a
stereotypical creation of both left and right, has fractured and
reformed in the increasingly global economy.

Yet recognising that the working class and peasants of 1917 are
different from the working class and peasants of 2020 should not cow
Leninists, it should inspire the further development of Marxist thought
and our programme. Today we have traditions of racial capitalism, social
reproduction theory and more to explain and identify revolutionary
potential across the global working class. With this come new spaces to
intervene, agitate, and form solidarity to organise a global
revolutionary movement. Ecological struggle provides an opportunity to
reformulate alliances between peasants, workers, land defenders,
students and others exploited peoples, creating new avenues to analyse
and shift the balance of class forces necessary for a revolutionary
situation.

We see glimpses of this in what Naomi Klein calls 'Blockadia', the
coalitions of students, leftists, and often Indigenous land defenders
who oppose new fossil fuel
infrastructure. [\[24\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn24) Transforming
this opposition to particular pieces of fossil fuel infrastructure into
a total and international opposition to fossil capitalism is crucial.
Recent instructive work in this area is that of Arboleda, whose studies
of Chile's mining supply chains point to the emergence of revolutionary
potential across peasants being proletarianized by mining, extractive
workers racialized and faced with outsourcing, and wider movements for
Indigenous
sovereignty. [\[25\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn25)

[[There are no easy answers to the questions of revolutionary agents and
revolutionary organisations, which Leninists of various stripes have
tackled with mixed results over the last hundred years]{.mark}. However,
rather than rejecting the concern or falling back onto the old cry of
'the party', ecological Leninists must work through the contradictions
of organising in a warming world, with the weight of a thousand failed
projects on our head. Perhaps the best summation of this project has
been made by Mohandesi:]{.underline}

I suggest we think of the "party" as an organization among others, one
defined by its articulating function, as that which unites disparate
social forces, links struggles over time, and facilitates the collective
project of building socialism beyond the
state. [\[26\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn26)

#### Existing imperial ideas 

**Woody**, 20**20** (Gus. "Revolutionary Reflections: Moving towards an
ecological Leninism" rs21. December 18, 2020.
https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/
///MF)

[[Perhaps the largest parallel between Lenin's thinking and the needs of
modern ecological Marxism left under-analysed by existing accounts is
the theory of imperialism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Lenin's Imperialism: The
Highest Stage of Capitalism presents an account of the imperialist
states which powerfully analysed the causes and contradictions of their
death project -- World War
One. [\[27\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn27) Today,
the analysis of modern imperialism should aim to do the same, to turn
the guns of ecological imperialism into the faces of global fossil
capitalism.

[Again, just as the form of the capitalist state has changed since 1917,
so too has the emergence and form of imperialism. Imperialism as
national acts of military expansion to secure resources has been joined
by an array of techniques by which global capitalism secures its
resource frontiers. In particular, the mechanisms by which international
bodies like the World Bank and IMF reinforce and intensify
core-periphery extraction have been studied extensively by Marxist
geographers and ecologists. [These insights need to be brought into the
analyses of environmentalists and socialists alike.]{.mark}]{.underline}

At the same time, Marxists and revolutionaries in the years since have
had to grow our thinking in the face of imperialist projects. Just as
Lenin pointed out how capitalism in the early 20th century could not be
analysed without an account of finance capital and imperialism, any
eco-socialism is intellectually bankrupt without an account of how
global fossil capital and climate breakdown depends on resource
imperialism. Marxists can draw on Jason Moore's historical accounts of
resource
frontiers, [\[28\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn28) Nick
Estes' writings on settler
colonialism, [\[29\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn29) Fanon, [\[30\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn30) Sivanandan [\[31\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn31) --
the list could go on. [These works make clear that we cannot account for
the climate crisis without accounting for the colonial project of
frontier expansion and extraction. With [a century of anti-colonial
struggle and thought inspired by Marxists, there is no excuse for modern
eco-socialists not to centre and build on these experiences in their
analysis of climate breakdown.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[As conflicts over certain resources, territories, [and technologies
emerge across the warming world]{.mark}, so too can we expect new forms
of climate imperialism[, which will pose challenges to an eco-socialist
left.]{.mark}]{.underline} We see glimpses of this in demands to send
European armies into the Amazon to prevent its burning, or in the
increasingly complex geopolitics of Lithium mining for batteries and
other renewable tech. Taking inspiration from Lenin and ensuring an
account of modern imperialism is central to explaining environmental
breakdown prevents socialists, particularly those in the Global North,
falling for an imperialist environmentalism. Otherwise, ecological
regimes could see themselves continuing extractive violence across the
world. Such is the case with many accounts of the Green New Deal, which
may talk of the exciting potential of batteries and electric
transitions, but talk little of global empire's continued extraction of
rare earth minerals through violence and exploitation in the Global
South.

[This may require engagement with the thorny questions of degrowth and
climate debt, which far too many so-called eco-socialists reject with
strawman arguments. [Certainly, within the varied literature on degrowth
there is some utopian hot air, but there is also attention to its links
to decolonisation and anti-imperialism.]{.mark} Global eco-socialist
solidarity will require massive programs of repair and restoration to
the damage caused by core nations to the periphery. There is a space
open to develop an ecological Leninist degrowth, which looks like a
fundamental reorganisation of the production and extraction which fuels
destruction in the core, towards the reversal of core-periphery
metabolic flows. Such a politics opens up a space to link up
revolutionaries in the core with those in the periphery, united in their
commitment to ending the politics of national growth and its
often-inevitable extractivism.]{.underline}

Taking a lead from Martin Arboleda's work on the political economy of
mining, Planetary Mine, ecological Leninism should attempt to understand
how the relations of global capitalism are determining the form and
content of imperialism, and what our responses might be across the
world. Through extensive analysis of the global mining supply chains and
extraction on the ground in Chile, Arboleda is able to discuss the ways
in which capitalist nations are interacting with each other, and [how
[the theory of imperial powers which Lenin analysed must be updated to
understand the different ways in which nations secure resource
extraction. By]{.mark} expanding on work accounting for the effects and
causes of contemporary imperialism like Planetary Mine and [making it a
core aspect of ecological Leninism, anti-imperialism can become a
necessary feature of any transitional ecological Leninist
regime.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### D.Scientific issues 

**Woody**, 20**20** (Gus. "Revolutionary Reflections: Moving towards an
ecological Leninism" rs21. December 18, 2020.
https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/
///MF)

[[A final question is that of the wider ways of approaching concerns
like 'nature' and 'science' in ecological Leninism]{.mark}.]{.underline}
After all, in his extensive philosophical work Materialism and
Empirio-Criticism Lenin attempted to sketch out an approach to matter,
science and similar philosophical concerns which could be brought in
line with
Marxism. [\[32\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn32) In
part a crude rebuke to rivals like Bogdanov, the work also became
foundational to questions of science and philosophy within the Soviet
Union, an important issue given the status of 'scientific socialism'
Marxism-Leninism
garnered. [\[33\] ](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn33)[[At
the same time, the wider translation of Lenin's Philosophical
Notebooks presented a wider and more nuanced approach to questions of
dialectics, nature, and science, the developments of which should be
crucial to ecological
Leninism. ]{.underline}]{.mark}[[[\[34\]]{.underline}](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn34)]{.mark}

Of course, the relations of science within nations like the USSR have
been critically analysed in several spaces. Most notably, Loren
Graham, [\[35\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn35) Helena
Sheehan, [\[36\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn36) and
others have pointed out how Lenin's philosophy and its further
bowdlerisation into the doctrines of 'dialectical materialism'
influenced the scholarship and work of scientists across the world.
Whilst this saw many leading scientific lights attempting to integrate
Marxist philosophy with science studies, such as the British Social
Relations of Science Movement in the
1930s, [\[37\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn37) it
also saw controversies like the Lysenko
affair. [\[38\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn38)

Whilst Marxists have gone back and forth on these particular historical
incidents, there have been significant developments around the critical
philosophies of nature and science during the 20th century. Histories of
the social construction of nature and science, and how these categories
are subsumed in processes of domination such as patriarchy, racism, and
colonialism have exploded on the scene. Donna Haraway's theories of
cyborgs and situated
perspectives, [\[39\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn39) with
its own approach to theory and the partiality of viewpoints is a
critical challenge to those constructing totalising theory today. At the
same time, the critical realism of Bhaskhar also emerged as an approach
to the gordian knot of knowledge and
science. [\[40\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn40) [These
histories and philosophies should be counterposed and read with Lenin's
philosophical works, to tease out the revolutionary kernels which can be
salvaged.]{.underline}

Ultimately, it must be recognised that the necessity of these
interventions is due in part to the failures of the crudest readings
of Empirio-Monism and other Marxist writings on science. [As new
discoveries in science and matter emerged across the last century, so
too did nuances have to be developed against official accounts of
Leninist philosophy.]{.underline} Such themes are most explicitly
adopted in Caudwell's Crisis in
Physics, [\[41\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn41) but
today even philosophy factories like
Zizek [[\[42\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn42) have
produced works considering how dialectical materialism or any 'Leninist'
account of matter, science and nature can keep up with the new
discoveries of physics and science. [Quantum mechanics, geo-engineering,
biotechnology -- all these disrupt interpretations of science and
nature, which poses a problem to an ecological scientific
socialism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Lenin's turn to dialectics and
his Philosophical Notebooks, given their traditional counterposing
to Empirio-Monism, may be the space to square these new developments
with a Leninist philosophical outlook.

[[With the rise of climate change, an ecological Leninism is forced to
seriously grapple with these questions of science, nature, and the wider
social ontology]{.underline}]{.mark}. Whilst this may seem a distraction
compared to the above questions, I would suggest the very opposite. In
questions of ecology, a binary has emerged between techno-optimist and
techno-critical schools with regards to mitigation and adaptation. Let
us paint crude pictures. One side focuses on a vision of eco-modernism,
where technologies bring the potential for luxury and a restructuring of
production towards liberatory and greener horizons. The other, adopts a
wider rejection of technologies' potentials, arguing instead for the
necessity of a crude degrowth or in some case primitivism.

Now these are caricatures, but a good ecological Leninist theory should
be able to steer a course between these two poles, rejecting their
fundamentally misguided assumptions. Rather than focusing on the
necessity or problem of science and its relationship with nature,
[[ecological Leninism should return to questions of the social relations
of science and nature.]{.underline}]{.mark} Technology is neither
inherently liberatory or oppressive, instead it is the social relations
of its production and implementation which determine its social effect.
In short, contemporary ecological Leninism should, whilst adopting some
form of critical realism in line with the broad thrust
of Empirio-Monism, focus on how capitalism develops and mobilises forms
of science and nature to the detriment of humanity. Starting from Lenin
here, despite the many exceptional thinkers who have come since, is
crucial precisely because Lenin sought to furnish Marxism with a wider
philosophical foundation which could complement militant struggle. An
ecological Leninism needs an underpinning which not only can explain the
historic development of science and nature, but which can comfortably
take lines in the current struggle.

Thus far, debates on the philosophical underpinnings of ecological
Marxism have focused on the frustrating topic of dualisms and
metabolisms. The volley of shots between scholars in this area, which
don't deserve rehashing, are a side distraction when it comes to the
meat of an ecological Marxist worldview. Ultimately the response must be
designing a historical and dialectical materialism which incorporates
the insights of thinkers who have pointed to the role of a racialised
and gendered capitalism in constructing certain sciences, technologies,
and natures.

#### Ecological Leninism has structural issues/prior questions 

**Woody**, 20**20** (Gus. "Revolutionary Reflections: Moving towards an
ecological Leninism" rs21. December 18, 2020.

Conclusion

The introduction to Bellamy Foster and Burkett's Marx and the
Earth highlights what may be termed the 'three stages' of ecosocialist
thought. [\[43\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn43) Put
simply, the first consisted of the rejection of aspects of Marxism, to
be supplemented by Green theory. The second saw the return of Marx: the
excavation of his ecological thought in the metabolic theory championed
by John Bellamy Foster and others. Finally, the third wave points to
those who apply metabolic theory and its insights to specific situations
and developments, the unleashing of the metabolism.

If we are to take seriously Marx's 11th thesis on Feuerbach,
'philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways;
the point is to change it', then we need to put the theory of the
metabolism to practical
use. [\[44\]](https://www.rs21.org.uk/2020/12/18/revolutionary-reflections-moving-towards-an-ecological-leninism/#_edn44) Being
able to explain particular ecological problems through Marxist metabolic
theory still requires consideration of how to build a seriously
revolutionary force. [Metabolic theory may point to nodes, points, and
flows in the metabolism where the proletariat can intervene, but it
tells us little about how to get there. [To put it crudely, there
remains the absent question of 'What is to be
Done?]{.mark}']{.underline}

I would suggest an ecological Leninism is the shift here. The fourth
wave of ecological Marxism. One which speaks of aiming to seize power,
moving swiftly to tackle the climate crisis, and doing so as
revolutionaries. The preceding comments are brief dips into the
pandora's box opened by this term. But to summarise the potential
directions of travel:

[[What is an ecological Leninist understanding of and approach to the
capitalist state?]{.mark} What does the ecological dictatorship of the
proletariat look like?]{.underline}

[[What is the organisational form of ecological Leninism?]{.mark} What
are the strategic priorities and programmes adopted by such a body
towards mass movements?]{.underline}

[W[hat is the ecological Leninist conception of modern
imperialism?]{.mark} How does this analysis contribute to the
development of global ecological revolution?]{.underline}

[What is bedrock of ecological Leninism's worldview? How does ecological
Leninism approach the gordian knots of 'nature' and 'science' in ways
that promote the transition to an ecological society?]{.underline}

[Finally, the thread that runs through all the above questions. [How
does an ecological Leninism learn from the successes and failures of
past Leninist analyses and projects? How does ecological Leninism
seriously attempt a synthesis between traditional Leninism, the changing
nature of the world, and the insights on these question since Lenin's
death?]{.mark}]{.underline}

There is a chance that any ecological Leninism, [if [it does answer the
above questions and build on the insights of the 100 years since War
Communism]{.mark},]{.underline} would be unrecognisable to the
Bolsheviks. Perhaps this is for the better. But the project of putting
ecological Marxism into practice, of building an ecological movement
which moves from tackling specific symptoms towards a revolutionary
strategy, may as well start with Lenin.

### 2AC \-- Ext: Transition Fails

#### Transition away from capitalism locks in climate change 

**Thornett**, 20**21** (Alan "A Reckless Short Cut" February 11, 2021.
<https://anticapitalistresistance.org/a-reckless-short-cut/> ///MF)

When I first saw the title of this book -- How to Blow up a Pipeline --
I could hardly believe it was serious. Unfortunately, it is. It is a
vigorously argued appeal for the environmental movement to break from
its past and make violent direct action, short of the loss of life,
against the fossil fuel infrastructure, central to its strategy to
defend the planet.

It calls for a direct action wing the climate movement to be established
to carry this out. Targets would include oil pipelines and refineries,
coal mines, power stations and privately owned high pollution vehicles
such as SUVs. [This, Malm argues, is the only real route to

Anyone taking the title of this book seriously could find a large team
of armed police kicking down their door at 4 am if they've been
discovered researching online how to destroy industrial infrastructure.
Possession of the materials needed to build an explosive device will get
you a lengthy jail sentence. Making an explosive device will get you
10-15 years in a high-security prison, assuming you don't blow yourself
up in the process. Discussing with others how to procure explosives will
get you a lengthy sentence for a conspiracy charge.

In terms of avoiding loss of life, the worst mass killings committed by
Irish Republicans were attacks against property that went wrong such as
the La Mon fire or Belfast in which 12 people were burned to death and
many other horribly disfigured of Bloody Friday in which five civilians
were blown apart.

Andreas Malm has been an environmental activist and writer for many
years. He took his doctorate with a dissertation on the history of
coal-fired steam power in Britain that was published by Verso as a book
-- Fossil Capital the rise in steam power and the roots of global
warming -- in 2016 and which received the Isaac and Tamara Deutscher
Memorial Prize before the end of the year. He has a teaching post at
Lund University in his native Sweden.\[i\]

He starts the book by recalling his participation in a mass protest in
1995, in Berlin, at COP1 -- the first of the UNs annual climate summits
that still take place today. From there he traces the struggle against
climate change through three key phase -- mostly in the global North.

The first, he argues, was in Britain between 2006 and 2009, when
activists organised a series of climate camps next to airports and power
stations which culminated in a massive People's Climate Summit at COP15
in Copenhagen in 2009.\[ii\]

The second was in the USA between 2011 and 2016 after Obama approved new
pipeline projects in the USA. Activists launched sit-ins protests
against the Keystone XL pipeline, gathered in New York for the "People's
Climate March," and camped to oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline. The
election of Donald Trump brought this to an abrupt end.

The third was global in summer 2018 when Greta Thunberg sat down in
front of the Swedish parliament and was global. What emerged was the
most remarkable strike movement in defence of the planet the world had
ever seen. Soon after Extinction Rebellion (XR) shut down central London
by seizing bridges and road junctions is a spectacular display on
non-violent direct action that was to continue until the outbreak of the
Covid-19 pandemic.\[iii\]

Despite all this, he concludes, the problem is now worse. More carbon
had been released into the atmosphere in the 25 years since COP1 than in
the 75 years before. Activists may have temporarily shut down a mine or
forced a government to deny an extraction permit, but the problem has
continued unabated. We march, he says, we block, we chain ourselves to
things, we remain peaceful, and nothing happens.\[iv\]

Time for a rethink

It is time, he decided, for a rethink. When he asks, "will we escalate
the struggle?" When do we start physically attacking the things that
consume our planet and destroy them with our own hands? "Is there a good
reason we have waited this long?" He backs this up with from an article
by the British novelist and essayist John Lanchester, published by
the London Review of Books in 2007, which asks the same question:

"It is strange and striking that climate change activists have not
committed any acts of terrorism. After all, terrorism is for the
individual by far the modern world's most effective form of political
action, and climate change is an issue about which people feel just as
strongly about as, say, animal rights. This is especially noticeable
when you bear in mind the ease of things like blowing up petrol stations
or vandalising SUVs... Say (in a city) fifty people vandalised four cars
every night for a month... these cars would soon be disappearing from
our streets".\[v\]

Malm blames "moral" or "strategic" pacifism for this inertia -- which,
he argues, has taken over the movement. He points in particular to the
veteran American journalist and environmental campaigner Bill McGibben
-- who was the driving force behind opposition to the Keystone XL
pipeline and the 350.org environmental network -- who, he says, took it
from Gandhi and Martin Luther King.\[vi\]\[vii\]

He saves his strongest criticism, however, for XR -- which he says has
codified the idea of non-violent direct action most thoroughly. He
quotes Roger Hallam (the co-founder of XR) in this regard:

"There are two types of disruption: violent and non-violent. Violence is
a traditional method. It is brilliant at getting attention and creating
chaos and disruption, but it is often disastrous when it comes to
creating progressive change. Violence destroys democracy and the
relationship with opponents which are vital to creating peaceful
outcomes to social conflict... In fact, it almost always leads to
fascism and authoritarianism. The alternative then is
non-violence."\[viii\]

Malm responds that slavery would not have been abolished without violent
direct action by the slaves themselves. It was also used successfully by
the suffragettes.

Violence, however, is the antithesis of building the biggest and
broadest mass movement of progressive forces the world has ever seen on
a socially inclusive and democratic basis -- which is the strategic task
we face today. [[Building support in the unions is difficult now but it
would be many times more difficult once the bombs started going
off.]{.underline}]{.mark}

It's true that violence can't be ruled out in all circumstances -- for
example in defence of life or in opposition to extreme brutality. It
would, however, as Hallam points out, be a disaster for the climate
movement which needs to build the biggest and most diverse movement the
world has ever seen if it is to successfully defend the planet. From
this perspective both Hallam's model of non-violent direct action and
the Malm model of embracing violence short of the loss of life is
elitist and an abandonment of the Marxist method of engaging the largest
possible number of people in political activity.

Malm is proposing an ecological version of pseudo-Marxist terrorist
organisations like the Red Army Faction or the Red Brigades, groups born
from despair at the ability of the working class to change society. They
may have been motivated by some sort of idealism and hope for a better
world, but they contributed nothing to the development of mass
movements. They were crushed by the state and their members spent
decades in prison, committed suicide or were killed by the police.

These organisations had training from the PLO and Stalinist states. What
military background would Malm's eco-terrorists have? They'd be in
prison within days.

Malm has supported non-violent direct action in the past. He recalls how
he was involved in the deflation the tyres of SUVs in an affluent
neighbourhood of Stockholm in July 2007. SUV owners, he says, awoke to
find their cars "reclining on the asphalt."

On their windshields, was a leaflet. "We have deflated one or more of
the tyres on your SUV,". "Don't take it personally. It's your SUV we
dislike." The leaflet pointed out how much fuel SUVs burned and the
impact this would have on the planet. At the same time, the saboteurs
published a statement exhorting others to copy their work and making
available a "simple manual" for how to release the air from a
tyre.\[ix\]

The proposal he makes in this book, however, is of a very different
order. The climate movement, he proposes -- if it can't get a
prohibition of all new sources of greenhouse gas emissions agreed by
governments -- should announce a prohibition unilaterally and be
prepared to enforce it "with our bodies and any other means necessary."

We should, he says, put such new emissions out of commission: "demolish
them, burn them or blow them up. Let the capitalists who keep on
investing in such emissions know that their properties will be
trashed".\[x\] Later he points out: "Pipelines are very easily
sabotaged. A simple explosive device can put a critical section of the
pipeline out of operation for weeks, the Pipeline and Gas journal
lamented in February 2005."\[xi\]

The illusion of a shortcut.

[The climate movement should reject Andreas Malm's appeal and his bid
for a shortcut. It reflects, I suspect -- apart from political
disorientation -- a frustration compounded by the lack of a socially
just exit strategy from fossil energy.]{.underline}

[There are, unfortunately, no shortcuts available with the prospect of a
progressive outcome. [Either a mass movement will be built with
progressive forces within it that can play a global role in the event of
the kind of societal and ecological breakdowns that we will be facing if
global warming and pollution of the planet are not stopped -- or the
future will be bleak indeed.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Forcing major structural change against the will of the capitalist
system will need a mass movement, and not just amongst environmental
activists but amongst the wider population as it is impacted by the
crisis.]{.underline}

[[There is, however, no common view in the wider movement on an exit
strategy from fossil energy, nor is there an adequate discussion on
it.]{.underline}]{.mark} The proposal with the most support -- and the
proposal that I support -- would transfer the fees levied on carbon
emissions directly into people's bank accounts on a heavily progressive
basis is James Hansen's fee and dividend proposal.

[[This could produce a big reduction in emissions in the short time we
have available and would be capable of commanding the popular support
necessary to generate the mass movement necessary to defend the
planet.]{.mark} This would need to go alongside a crash programme of
renewable energy generation to meet the demand that these new incentives
would create.]{.underline}

Interestingly, Noam Chomsky supported Hansen recently in a New Year
interview entitled Where the Left Goes After Trump\[xii\] -- which dealt
with how to halt to global warming and climate change.

"If you have a carbon tax don't do it as Macron did it in France --
which led to the yellow vests movement -- which was a carbon tax that
hits the working class. If you do that you are going to get an uprising.
You can have a carbon tax in which the revenue is returned to the public
in a progressive manner which then benefits the working class. Yes, you
pay a bit more for gas but you get a lot more in return."

I strongly agree with Chomsky on this. Cutting emissions this way is, in
the end, the only progressive way of doing it since it can be carried
through within an overall taxation framework that is socially and
economically progressive. The other alternatives, often advanced by the
left, such as production cuts by government decision or rationing do not
work and indeed can have serious negative consequences.

Andreas Malm has been a big asset to the movement -- he should, however,
think again before making any further attempts to take the movement down
what could be a very dangerous road.

A senior European Commission economist has warned that a [[Third World
War]{.mark} is an [extremely "high probability]{.mark}" in coming years
[due to the disintegration of global capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In a working paper published last month, Professor Gerhard Hanappi
argued that [since the 2008 financial crash, the [global economy]{.mark}
has [moved]{.mark} away from "integrated" capitalism [into a
"**disintegrating" shift**]{.mark} [marked by]{.mark} the [same]{.mark}
sorts of [trends]{.mark} which [preceded **previous world
wars**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Professor Hanappi is Jean Monnet Chair for Political Economy of
European Integration --- an European Commission
appointment]{.underline} --- at the Institute for Mathematical Models in
Economics at the Vienna University of Technology. He also sits on the
management committee of the Systemic Risks expert group in the EU-funded
European Cooperation in Science and Technology research network.

[In his new paper, Hanappi concludes that [global conditions bear
unnerving parallels with trends before the outbreak of the first and
second world wars.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Key red flags]{.mark} [that]{.mark} the [world is on a slippery slope
to]{.mark} a global [war]{.mark}, he finds,
[include]{.mark}]{.underline}:

the inexorable growth of military spending;

democracies transitioning into increasingly authoritarian police states;

heightening geopolitical tensions between great powers;

the resurgence of populism across the left and right;

[the breakdown and [weakening of]{.mark} established global
[institutions that govern]{.mark} transnational
[capitalism]{.mark};]{.underline}

and the relentless widening of global inequalities.

[These trends, some of which were visible before the previous world
wars, are reappearing in new forms.]{.underline} Hanappi argues that the
[[defining feature]{.mark} of the current period [is]{.mark} a
[transition]{.mark} from an older form of "integrating capitalism"
[to]{.mark} a new form of "[disintegrating
capitalism]{.mark}",]{.underline} whose features most clearly emerged
after the 2008 financial crisis.

For most of the twentieth century, he says, **[global capitalism was on
an "integrating" pathway toward higher concentrations of transnational
wealth]{.underline}**. This was interrupted by the outbreaks of violent
nationalism involving the two world wars. After that, a new form of
"integrated capitalism" emerged based on an institutional framework that
has allowed industrialised countries to avoid a world war for 70 years.

T[his [system is now entering a period of
disintegration]{.mark}.]{.underline} Previously, fractures within the
system between rich and poor were overcome "by distributing a bit of the
gains of the tremendous increase of the fruits of the global division of
labour to the richer working classes in these nations." Similarly,
international tensions were diffused through transnational governance
frameworks and agreements for the regulation of capitalism.

But since the 2008 financial crisis, wealth distribution has worsened,
with purchasing power for the middle and working classes declining as
wealth becomes even more greatly concentrated.

Growth in the Western centres of transnational capital has slowed, while
formerly sacrosanct international trade agreements are being torn to
shreds. This has fuelled a reversion to nationalism in which global and
transnational structures have been rejected, and 'foreigners' have been
demonised. As global capital thus continues to disintegrate, these
pressures escalate, particularly as its internal justification depends
increasingly on intensifying competition with external rivals.

While integrated capitalism depended on a transnational institutional
framework that permitted "stable exploitation on a national level",
Hanappi argues that "disintegrating capitalism" sees this framework
become disaggregated between the USA, Europe, Russia and China, each of
which pursues new forms of hierarchical subordination of workers.

[Disintegrating capitalism, he explains, [will resort increasingly
to]{.mark} "direct [coercive powers]{.mark} supplemented by new
information technologies" [to suppress internal tensions]{.mark}, as
well as a greater propensity for international hostilities:]{.underline}
"The new authoritarian empires need confrontation with each other to
justify their own internal, inflexible command structure."

**[[Great power conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[Hanappi explores **[three potential scenarios]{.mark} [for]{.mark} how
a [new global conflict could unfold]{.mark}**. In his first scenario, he
explores the [prospect of a war between the three most prominent
military powers: the US, Russia and China.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[All three have experienced large increases in military
spending]{.underline}]{.mark} since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Despite a dip for the US since 2011, President Trump has ushered in a
new spike, while Russian spending has plateaued and Chinese expenditures
are rapidly increasing. [All three countries have also experienced an
authoritarian turn.]{.underline}

Drawing on game theory, [Hanappi argues that the calculus that none of
these countries would be capable of 'winning' a world war may be
changing in the perceptions]{.underline} of the leaderships of these
countries. By one estimate, China has the highest probability of
survival at 52 per cent, followed by the US at 30 per cent, and Russia
at 18 per cent. This calculus suggests that of all the three powers,
[[China]{.mark} might be the [most inclined to escalate direct hostile
military activities]{.mark} that challenge its rivals if it perceives a
direct threat to what it sees as its legitimate interests.]{.underline}

The US and Russia in contrast might transfer the focus of their military
activities on more covert, indirect and proxy mechanisms. In the US
case, Hanappi points out:

"... the military strategy of Trump seems to include the possibility to
delegate part of local operational responsibility to close vassals,
which receive massive weapon support from the US, e.g. Saudi Arabia and
Israel in the Middle East. Turkey, one of the strongest NATO branches in
the area is a special case. It seems to have been allowed to destroy an
emergent state of the Kurdish population, which would have been closer
to the European style of governance."

[There are [growing signs of heightened great power tensions]{.mark}
which [could erupt]{.mark} entirely by accident or unanticipated
provocation [into a **global conflict**]{.mark} that nobody
wants.]{.underline}

[The **[US-China trade war is escalating]{.mark}**, while both powers
tussle over technology secrets and argue over China's growing military
footprint in the South China Sea.]{.underline} Meanwhile Trump's massive
expansion of the US Navy and Air Force point to preparations for a major
potential conflict with either China or Russsia.

[Both the [US and Russia have jettisoned a critical nuclear
treaty]{.mark} established since the Cold War opening the way to a
nuclear arms race.]{.underline} North Korea remains unrepentant about
its ongoing nuclear weapons programme while Trump's tearing up of the
nuclear agreement with Iran disincentivises that country from complying
with disarmament and reporting terms.

[Early last year, a [statistical study]{.mark} of the frequency of major
wars in human history [found]{.mark} that the [so-called]{.mark} [70
years of ']{.mark}long [peace']{.mark} is simply [not]{.mark} an
[unusual]{.mark} phenomenon indicating an unprecedented period of peace.
The study concluded that there was no reason to believe that the **[70
year period]{.mark} so far would not [give way to another major
war]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

#### [Revolution against capitalism bad]{.underline} -- leads to war and chaos for years

**[Now [perhaps the revolutionaries have persuaded us that negative
outcomes are far-fetched]{.mark}, [that we are very confident that
revolution will]{.mark} [usher in]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark}
eventually, **[[the land of milk and honey]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[It
is still the case that [in this model the promised land will only be
reached after a social breakdown of unknown
duration]{.mark}]{.underline}**[: **[A complete overhaul in the
organization of production]{.underline}**]{.mark} will lead to some
middle period of deteriorating material welfare as capitalists rapidly
exit the economy. **[[This means chaos and uncertainty, but it could
also mean war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The interregnum]{.mark} [could
last]{.mark} a year, but it might last [two
decades]{.mark},]{.underline}** [and]{.mark} however optimistic we are
about the end point, [**[we cannot in advance know how long this interim
phase will persist]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[In the meantime,
revolutionary enthusiasm will wane]{.underline}**, erstwhile supporters
will decamp, a "stay-the-course" electoral strategy will be outflanked
by competitor parties promising a return to normalcy, and the desire to
consolidate gains will make the authoritarian impulse greater. From a
materialist perspective, the uncertain passage through what Przeworski
(1986) calls the "transition trough" makes the journey less appealing.26

**[[To my mind, these factors explain why all working classes in all
developed democracies have been decidedly reformist in
orientation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The reason why revolutionary
socialism has always been marginal in rich capitalist economies---and
will always be outflanked by reform-oriented socialism---is that only
the latter consistently deliver high (and usually increasing) standards
of living and low (and usually decreasing) levels of risk. As long as
the Mad Max world of catastrophic collapse can be avoided,
reform-oriented parties will always better capture the enthusiasm of
poor and working people.

Thus, when we try to explain the non-revolutionary attitudes of our
working-class friends and family, we do not need to lean on the false
consciousness account, for there is a more parsimonious materialist
explanation. As such, any case for revolution must be non-materialist in
character: You can be a materialist or a revolutionary, but not both.

This is the dilemma the revolutionaries must consider: **[[Revolution is
only possible when the forces of production are underdeveloped]{.mark},
but it can only be successful when they are sufficiently developed to
make socialism]{.underline}** (or communism) **[objectively
viable]{.underline}**.27 As Elster (1986) has argued, the circumstances
under which revolutions spark and succeed never coincide.

[**[What about the capitalists]{.underline}**?]{.mark} Under these
circumstances, **[[it is reasonable to expect that they will fight far
harder against a revolution than they would against reformist
drives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Indeed, ignoring the response from
capitalists violates Elster's first law of political rationality: Never
assume your opponent is less rational than you. If revolution were the
alternative, employers would grant every imaginable reform, from far
higher taxes to the rejiggering of power relations in the workplace. In
a mugging, most people will surrender their wallet before their life.

**[Russia\'s war on [Ukraine]{.mark} both reflects and deepens a global
split that [should remind us of]{.mark} Karl [Marx\'s famous
remark]{.mark}]{.underline}**: **[[\'No social order ever disappears
before all the productive forces]{.mark}, for which there is room in it,
have been developed; and new higher relations of production never appear
before the material conditions of their existence have matured in the
womb of the old society.\']{.underline}** Britain has already lost its
particular social order - its empire - and the United States is now
losing its. Despite differences, both of these social orders shared a
mostly private form of capitalist relations of production (the
organisation of enterprises centred on private employers and employees).
That social order has given way to a different, mostly public form of
capitalist relations of production where state officials are major
employers. The latter form of capitalism is developing most dramatically
in China. As defined by its core productive relation of
employer/employee, capitalism is now developing its productive forces
and its GDP growth faster in China\'s public form of capitalism than in
the US\'s private form of capitalism. The role of the state is central
to this decline of capitalism in one area and form and its ascent in
another area and form. In the West, the relation between capitalism, and
especially its defenders and ideologues, on one side, and the actuality
of the state apparatus, on the other, is hypocritical. Part of China\'s
embrace of a strong state emerged from its affiliations with the Soviet
Union and the history of socialism in the 19th and 20th centuries.
**[Most socialists then subscribed to one or another version of the idea
that [the]{.mark} [transition from capitalism to socialism required the
workers to seize the state via]{.mark} ballots or [bullets]{.mark}. The
[state]{.mark} became [key to this transition to a socialist
system]{.mark}. Many socialists advocated strong state apparatuses on
the basis of what they hoped such states might then do]{.underline}**,
namely make the social transition to socialism beyond capitalism, that
is beyond the employer/employee production relationship. **[Yet those
states, where and [when socialists achieved power, proved to be
limited]{.mark}. They [never accomplished that transition beyond
short-lived experiments]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Ever since, socialists
have analysed and debated the lessons of those experiments.

**[In state-monopoly capitalism, the role of the organs of the state is
immensely significant in the economy]{.underline}**. [**[If workers can
fill posts in the state organs and go on intervening in national
policies, will they also be able to change the foundations of the
capitalist economy gradually]{.underline}**?]{.mark} Such a question is
derived from the fact that the fundamental character of the state in
state-monopoly capitalism, as well as the essential qualities of the
privately owned means of production in monopoly capital, are not
sufficiently recognized. **[Monopoly capitalists hold the fundamental
right to determine production plans of their privately owned means of
production]{.underline}**. **[The role of the state is to support and
strengthen such rights.]{.underline}** This is not something to be
changed, even if working class representatives have power in government
organs, as they would be converted to serving members of the organs of
the monopoly capitalist state. **[For the state to wield its position to
deprive the decision-making power of production from private monopolies,
[the state's power must be transferred to the people led by the working
class]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In this case, **[[it is necessary that the
internal activities of the state organs must cooperate with the
revolutionary movements]{.mark} led by the working class.]{.underline}**
In any case, **[[it is impossible to hope that the character of the
state will gradually change and that the foundations of the capitalist
economy will be destroyed without a struggle for state

[[Research on civil wars]{.mark} has [paid scant attention to]{.mark} a
key (and variable) dimension of [rebel political
identity:]{.mark}]{.underline} [some rebels are revolutionaries seeking
to reshape their societies in radical ways.]{.underline} We study the
most common strain of revolutionary rebels: revolutionary socialist or
Marxist-inspired rebels; we find that despite ideological and contextual
differences, they were "high capacity" actors in civil wars, able to
rise against stronger regimes. [[Civil wars fought with]{.mark}
revolutionary [socialist rebels took the form of]{.mark} irregular or
[guerrilla wars]{.mark}, lasted longer, and produced more battlefield
fatalities on average.]{.underline} At the same time, we also find that
[[these rebels']{.mark} higher capacity failed to translate into
victories. They [were defeated]{.mark} at a rate that was no different
from other rebels\--hence a "Marxist Paradox."]{.underline} We make
sense of this paradox by pointing to the dynamic and world-systemic
nature of civil wars: [**powerful [revolutionary challenges]{.mark}
[engendered equally powerfu]{.mark}l** and often successful
**[counter-revolutionary reactions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. An
implication that follows from our analysis is that during the Cold War,
revolutionary civil wars had a state-building rather than state-failing
effect.
