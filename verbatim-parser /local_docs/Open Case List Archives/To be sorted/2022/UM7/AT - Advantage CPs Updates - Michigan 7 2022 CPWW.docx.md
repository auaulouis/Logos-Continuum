### Adv-CP Card AnswersThis card is like 1/2 way there- it still assumes an increase in temperature

#### 1. Climate change causes crop failure

**Kirk 20**, Karin Kirk, geologist scientist and climate change solver,
12/13/2020, "More CO2 in the atmosphere hurts key plants and crops more
than it helps",
https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/12/more-co2-in-the-atmosphere-hurts-key-plants-and-crops-more-than-it-helps/

The basics of climate change are actually easy to understand. [Human
[activities emit]{.mark} around [[100 million
tons](https://www.iea.org/articles/global-co2-emissions-in-2019) of
CO2]{.mark}]{.underline} every day, mostly by burning fossil fuels,
which [causes the [atmosphere]{.mark} to [trap]{.mark} more
[heat]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a result of that heat-trapping pollution,
the [atmosphere, land, and oceans have all [become
warmer](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/2/)]{.underline}. The
added heat triggers side effects like more intense rainstorms, floods,
prolonged heat waves, and droughts. In turn, [[those]{.mark} unpleasant
[conditions lead to]{.mark} more frequent and severe
**[wildfires]{.mark}, [insect]{.mark} [outbreaks]{.mark}, [and crop
failure]{.mark}s**.]{.underline} Sure, today's [plants have a bit more
fertilizer from the extra CO2]{.underline} in the air, [but that
additional [CO2 causes]{.mark} many other
[problems]{.mark},]{.underline} harming many plants and crops. Climate
change is disrupting plant growth. Scientists have performed many
experiments to see what happens when plants and agricultural crops
receive extra CO2. [When supplemental CO2 was pumped into the air around
plants, they grew faster.]{.underline} For this reason[, CO2 is
sometimes piped into enclosed greenhouses]{.underline} to boost
production. [But greenhouse plants also have optimal amounts of water,
excellent soil, and controlled temperatures.]{.underline} It's usually a
different story out in the real world. To conduct a more "real world"
experiment, [other [studies have given plants]{.mark} extra [CO2 plus an
**increase in temp**]{.mark}**erature**. [In these]{.mark} conditions,
many [plants and crops grew poorly]{.mark}.]{.underline} In most cases,
t[he [boost]{.mark} from CO2 [was
[overwhelmed]{.mark}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1369526616300334?via%3Dihub)
[by]{.mark} the [hotter conditions]{.mark}.]{.underline} These
experiments demonstrate that the myth of CO2 fertilization is false, and
peer-reviewed [reports
find](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/10#key-message-1) that
major crops like wheat, rice, corn, and soybeans [will become less
productive](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/35/9326) as the world heats
up. [Likewise, a landmark [study in
2018](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/5/eaaq1012) found that
[growing]{.mark} rice [in high-CO2 conditions]{.mark} [makes]{.mark} it
[less nutritious]{.mark}.]{.underline} As a basic grain, rice plays a
critical role in feeding the world's population. The extra CO2 caused an
imbalance within the crop's chemical makeup, which resulted in rice that
had lower amounts of protein, iron, zinc, and B-vitamins. "[[The]{.mark}
entire elemental [balance is out of whack]{.mark}," explained plant
physiologist Lewis Ziska, an author of the study.]{.underline} This
result is yet another example of how the recipe of nature is being
disrupted by excess CO2.

#### 2. Increasing CO2 causes ocean acidification

**CRP 16**, Climate Reality Project, The Climate Reality Project is an
organization dedicated to solving for climate change, 6/21/2016, "GLOBAL
WARMING'S EVIL TWIN: OCEAN ACIDIFCATION",
https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/global-warming-ocean-acidification

So, exactly [what is ocean acidification? Our [oceans are a]{.mark}n
incredible [carbon sink]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[they absorb]{.mark}
[about 25 percent of]{.mark} the [carbon]{.mark} dioxide humans
produce]{.underline} every year. But [[this is changing sea]{.mark}
surface [chemistry]{.mark}]{.underline} dramatically: [when
carbon]{.underline} dioxide [is absorbed by the ocean, it
dissolves]{.underline} to form carbonic acid. [The result,]{.underline}
not surprisingly, [is that the ocean becomes]{.underline} more
[acidic]{.underline}, upsetting the delicate pH balance that millions
and millions of organisms rely on. Since the Industrial Revolution, our
seas have become about 30 percent more acidic, a rate not observed in
300 million years. [[This has]{.mark} a wide range of [consequences
for]{.mark} marine [ecosystems, **as well as**]{.mark} **for the
[billions]{.mark} of people** who depend on the ocean for food and
survival. Ocean acidification is often called global warming's evil
twin. Oceans becoming more acidic]{.underline} after the Industrial
Revolution is no accident. [As humans burn more and more]{.underline}
fossil fuels, the [concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere
continues to rise, driving climate change]{.underline} and making both
air and sea temperatures hotter and hotter. [But climate change isn't
the only consequence of carbon pollution --- so is ocean
acidification.]{.underline} With more and more carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere, oceans absorb more and more of it, becoming -- you guessed
it -- more and more acidic. [[This is happening at]{.mark} an
[unprecedented rate]{.mark}]{.underline} and will continue unabated if
we don't stop burning dirty fossil fuels.

#### 3. Food insecurity causes war\-\--their studies are flawed

**Brinkman and Hendrix 11**, Henk-Jan Brinkman and Cullen S. Hendrix,
Brinkman is the chief of peace-building strategy at the UN Hendrix is a
nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International
Economics, is director, 7/11, "Food Insecurity and Violent Conflict:
Causes, Consequences, and Addressing the Challenges",
https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Henk-Jan-Brinkman/publication/322928073_Food_Insecurity_and_Violent_Conflict_Causes_Consequences_and_Addressing_the_Challenges/links/5a7786a045851541ce5a62e4/Food-Insecurity-and-Violent-Conflict-Causes-Consequences-and-Addressing-the-Challenges.pdf

[The [links between food insecurity and]{.mark} interstate [war are less
direct]{.mark}]{.underline}. While countries often go to war over
territory, [previous research has not focused directly on access to food
or productive agricultural land as a major driver of conflict
(Hensel]{.underline}, 2000). [[However, wars have been waged]{.mark} to
reduce demographic pressures]{.underline} arising from the scarcity of
arable land, the clearest examples being the move to acquire Lebensraum
("living space") that motivated [[Nazi Germany's]{.mark} aggression
toward Poland and Eastern Europe]{.underline} (Hillgruber, 1981) [and
[Japan's]{.mark} invasion of China and Indochina]{.underline} (Natsios
and Doley, 2009). Water, for drinking and for agriculture, is also a
cause of conflict (Klare, 2002). [[Countries that share river
basins]{.mark} are more likely to go to war than are other countries
that border one another]{.underline} (Toset et al., 2000; Gleditsch et
al., 2006). [[This]{.mark} relationship [is strongest in countries with
low levels of]{.mark} economic [development]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Institutions that manage conflicts over water and monitor and enforce
agreements can significantly reduce the risk of war (Postel and Wolf,
2001). [Jared Diamond (1997) has argued that for centuries [military
power]{.mark} was [built on ag]{.mark}ricultural
[production]{.mark}]{.underline}. Zhang et al. (2007) show that
[long-term [fluctuations]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the prevalence of [war
followed]{.mark} cycles of [temperature change]{.mark} over the period
1400--1900 CE,]{.underline} with [[more war during periods
of]{.underline}]{.mark} relatively cooler temperatures and thus [[lower
ag]{.mark}ricultural [productivity]{.mark}]{.underline} and greater
competition for resources. Similar findings linking cooler periods with
more war have been established for Europe between 1000 and 1750 CE (Tol
and Wagner, 2008).

#### 4. Its not just carbon that is an impact of climate change\-\--other gasses too

**SpaceKnow 19**, SpaceKnow, SpaceKnow is a website dedicated to
creating an encyclopedia based on satellite data, 2/26/2019, "Will air
pollution cause human extinction?",Need an impact to this- like methane
or sulfur causes XYZ bad thing/extinction

https://spaceknow.com/blog/will-air-pollution-cause-human-extinction/

"Climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods,
security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific," according to the
Boe Declaration of the 18 countries at the 49th Pacific Islands Forum in
September 2018. [It's not only [carbon emissions]{.mark} [like
methane]{.mark} (CH4) and [carbon dioxide]{.mark} (CO2) that [disturb
the atmosphere]{.mark} and threaten climate change, [but also]{.mark}
high concentrations of [carbon monoxide]{.mark} (CO), [nitrogen
dioxide]{.mark} (NO2), [sulfur dioxide]{.mark} (SO2), and
[formaldehyde]{.mark} (HCHO) [along with]{.mark} various [aerosol
halocarbons]{.mark} (CFCs) that, together, have a **[devastating]{.mark}
impact on [the environment]{.mark}** over time.]{.underline}

#### 5. Acid rain causes extinction\-\--dinosaurs prove\-\--(Image inserted for reference) 

Wogan, 14, Tim Wogan, Tim Wogan writes about scientific discoveries
because in his own words, 3/10/2014, "Dinosaur mass extinction may have
been triggered by acid rain",
<https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/dinosaur-mass-extinction-may-have-been-triggered-by-acid-rain/7166.article>

Around 65 million years ago[, 71--[81% of]{.mark} all [species on
Earth]{.mark} -- including land dinosaurs -- [were wiped
out]{.mark}]{.underline} following an asteroid impact in Southeastern
Mexico. Now, [Japanese scientists have carried out the most realistic
laboratory simulations]{.underline} of the impact to date and found
[**[[the extinction]{.mark} may have been down to [acid
rain,]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}triggered by the release of sulfur
trioxide](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2095.html)
when the asteroid slammed into sulfur-rich rocks. ![A picture containing
grass, outdoor, mammal Description automatically
generated](media/image1.jpeg){width="3.123611111111111in"
height="3.7787609361329833in"} (C) Shutterstock The [[sulfur]{.mark}
[trioxide]{.mark} released upon impact could have [caused acid
rain]{.mark}]{.underline} on a global scale Most scientists accept the
principal cause of the Cretaceous--Tertiary mass extinction was a 10km
asteroid hitting the Yucatan peninsula, but the precise mechanism by
which this caused the extinction remains controversial. Some think that
dust and aerosols thrown up by the asteroid cooled and darkened the
Earth's surface, blocking photosynthesis and causing the death of plant
life and the consequent starvation of animals. Alternatively, oxidation
of sulfur-rich minerals may have caused [widespread acid
**rain**]{.underline} that **[[acidified the
oceans]{.underline}]{.mark}**, dissolving the calcareous skeletons of
many plants and animals. This would explain the high proportion of
sulfate minerals in sedimentary deposits from this time and the 'fern
spike' -- the plants that survived the catastrophe best and recolonised
the Earth quickest were ferns, which grow well in acidic soil. But the
usual product of sulfur oxidation is sulfur dioxide. This would have
stayed in the atmosphere for several months as it converted slowly to
sulfur trioxide before dissolving in water to form sulfuric acid.
Rainwater would therefore have been only weakly acidic, and the drop in
oceanic pH quite small.

#### 6. Pesticides are good\-\--they solve all food issues

**Fruitgrowers 19**, fruitgrowers, fruitgrowers is a website dedicated
to describing farmers and the processes they use when growing crops,
5/9/2019, "The [[Benefits of Pesticide Use]{.underline}]{.mark} in
Agriculture",
https://fruitgrowers.com/the-benefits-of-pesticide-use-in-agriculture/#:\~:text=More%20specifically%2C%20pesticides%20can%20keep,of%20the%20use%20of%20pesticides.

[Plants face numerous hazards that threaten to kill them off every day.
In fact, there are more than 30,000 species of [weeds]{.mark} alone, all
of which can [stunt plant growth]{.mark} and even [damage]{.mark} entire
[crops]{.mark}.]{.underline} In addition, [there are more than 10,000
types of insects that eat plants.]{.underline} Then there are the
threats the plants have to face once they are pulled from the fields and
put into storage--since [[insects]{.mark}, [rodents and mold can]{.mark}
all [cause damage]{.mark} to them. Obviously, just allowing the plants
to die--[unprotected by pesticides]{.mark}--isn't an option, as this
decision would have far-reaching consequences. Not only would the
[farmers lose]{.mark} a lot [money]{.mark} and [time]{.mark}, but **[the
world would lose]{.mark} much of its [food]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[Considering that [[about **795 million
people**]{.mark}](https://www.foodaidfoundation.org/world-hunger-statistics.html)
[globally]{.mark} don't have enough food to eat,]{.underline} this would
be unconscionable. On top of that, [[what little]{.mark} food we'd have
[left would be too expensive]{.mark}]{.underline} for most people to
afford, meaning [[few]{.mark} people [would be able to]{.mark}
[buy]{.mark} fresh [fruits, vegetables and grains]{.mark}]{.underline}
year-round--leading to a health crisis. Clearly, pesticides are
necessary for crops!

#### 7. Nanotech solves the environment 

**NNI ND**, National Nanotechnology Institute, The Nanotech initiative
is run by the US government and describe show the nanotech is being used
and its potential uses, ND, "[National Nanotechnology
Initiative](file:///C:\Users\jreub\Downloads\National%20Nanotechnology%20Initiative)",
<https://www.nano.gov/about-nanotechnology/applications-nanotechnology#:~:text=Nanotechnology%20has%20greatly%20contributed%20to,and%20larger%20amounts%20of%20information>.

In addition to the ways [that [nanotech]{.mark}nology [can]{.mark} help
[improve energy efficiency]{.mark} (see the section above), there are
also many ways that it can help [detect and clean up]{.mark}
environmental [contaminants]{.mark}:]{.underline}

[[Nanotechnology]{.mark} could [help]{.mark} meet the [need for]{.mark}
affordable, clean drinking [water]{.mark} through rapid, low-cost
detection and treatment of impurities in water]{.underline}. 

[[Engineers]{.mark} have [developed a thin]{.mark} film
[membrane]{.mark} with nanopores [for]{.mark} energy-efficient
[desalination]{.mark}]{.underline}. This molybdenum disulphide (MoS2)
membrane filtered two to five times more water than current conventional
filters.

[[Nanoparticles]{.mark} are being developed to [clean]{.mark} industrial
[water pollutants]{.mark}]{.underline} in ground water through chemical
reactions that render the pollutants harmless. This process would cost
less than methods that require pumping the water out of the ground for
treatment.

[Researchers have developed [a nanofabric \"paper towel]{.mark}\" woven
from tiny wires of potassium manganese oxide that [can absorb 20 times
its weight]{.mark} in oil for cleanup applications.]{.underline}
Researchers have also placed magnetic water-repellent nanoparticles in
oil spills and used magnets to mechanically remove the oil from the
water.

[Many [airplane]{.mark} cabin and other types of air [filters are
nanotechnology-based]{.mark} filters that allow "mechanical
filtration]{.underline}," in which the [fiber [material]{.mark} [creates
nanoscale pores]{.mark} that trap particles larger than the size of the
pores]{.underline}. The filters also may contain charcoal layers that
remove odors. 

[[Nanotech]{.mark}nology-enabled [sensors]{.mark} and solutions are now
able to [detect and identify chemical or]{.mark} biological
[agents]{.mark}]{.underline} in the air and soil with much higher
sensitivity than ever before. Researchers are investigating particles
such as self-assembled monolayers on mesoporous supports (SAMMS™),
dendrimers, and carbon nanotubes to determine how to apply their unique
chemical and physical properties for various kinds of toxic site
remediation. Another sensor has [been developed by NASA as a smartphone
extension that firefighters can use to monitor air quality around
fir]{.underline}

#### 8. Decline causes war\-\--1930s 

**Library of Congress ND**, Library of Congress, The Library of Congress

Source Timeline" ,
https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/great-depression-and-world-war-ii-1929-1945/overview/

[The [economic troubles of the]{.mark} 19[30s were worldwide]{.mark} in
scope and effect.]{.underline} [Economic [instability led to political
instability]{.mark} in many parts of the world.]{.underline} Political
[chaos, in turn, gave [rise to dictatorial regimes such as]{.mark} Adolf
[Hitler\'s]{.mark} in Germany [and]{.mark} the military\'s [in
Japan]{.mark}]{.underline}. (Totalitarian regimes in the Soviet Union
and Italy predated the depression.) These [[regimes pushed the
world]{.mark} ever-closer [to war]{.mark} in the 1930s]{.underline}.
When world [war finally broke out]{.underline} in both Europe and Asia,
the United States tried to avoid being drawn into the conflict. But so
powerful and influential a nation as the United States could scarcely
avoid involvement for long.

#### 9. AI is good\-\--it can't do anything badprove

**Pierce 22**, RJ Pierce, RJ Pierce is a writer for the Tech Times,
2/17/2022, "AI Will NOT Take Over The World And Drive Humanity To
Extinction\--Here\'s Why",
<https://www.techtimes.com/articles/271938/20220217/why-ai-wont-take-over-the-world.htm>

In an article by [The
Conversation](https://theconversation.com/worried-about-ai-taking-over-the-world-you-may-be-making-some-rather-unscientific-assumptions-103561),
they put this specific argument forward. A [[machine can]{.mark} always
\"[learn]{.mark}\" if it is fed data about the task it\'s meant to
achieve. Sure, [it can process information]{.mark} [much faster than a
human can]{.mark} (and perhaps even come up with solutions no person can
ever think of), but it doesn\'t make the machine smarter than a human at
all.]{.underline} Here\'s one situation where [machine learning is still
way behind human learning]{.underline}. Take a toddler, for instance.
That child can learn how to do a specific task within seconds just by
watching somebody do it. [[A machine can]{.mark} only [learn]{.mark}
something if it is fed an extremely [massive amount of data]{.mark},
which [it uses]{.mark} [when]{.mark} [performing trial-and-error]{.mark}
according to [Synthesys](https://synthesys.io/). \'Super-Intelligent\'
[Machines Are NOT The Problem]{.mark} At the end of the day, it still
falls on the human element of the issue. You should be far more scared
of how humans use artificial intelligence, and not the AI
itself.]{.underline} This is considering the [[tech]{.mark}nology[\'s
capability to draw conclusions]{.mark} from whatever data is being fed
to it and how it [can]{.mark} only [focus on one task at a
time]{.mark}.]{.underline} (Photo : Getty Images ) In other words, an
[AI trained to do something good, [like identifying climate change
tipping
points](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/265748/20210923/artificial-intelligence-to-identify-climate-tipping-points.htm),]{.underline}
is not dangerous at all. [But a machine which is trained in something
bad, like warfare, can be extremely perilous]{.underline}. So don\'t be
scared of robots taking over the world, because people-not the perceived
dangers of AI-will still be the most critical aspect of civilization\'s
downfall.

#### 10. AI solves biodiversity loss

**Snow 19**, Jackie Snow, Jackie Snow MIT Technology Review's associate
editor for artificial intelligence and author of the Algorithm,
3/20/2019, "Can Artificial Intelligence Help Save the Natural World?",
<https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/author/jackie-snow/>

Th[e name [TrailGuard]{.mark} comes from the fact that despite the
enormous areas some reserves cover]{.underline}, there are still choke
points poachers have to travel through, allowing **[[cameras]{.mark} to
be [setup]{.mark} up strategically [in]{.mark} those
[places]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To be helpful, the cameras have to work
autonomously, be low-powered, and send photos in real time. An earlier
iteration of the TrailGuard camera didn't have AI built in and sent back
photos that 75 percent of the time had no humans in them. [The [cameras
would be triggered by]{.mark} a [cloud]{.mark} moving in front of the
[s]{.mark}un, swaying [grass]{.mark}, [or animals]{.mark} going
by.]{.underline} These false triggers eat up precious battery life and
become a nuisance to the rangers who have to drop what they are doing
and look through images. [Plus, changing batteries every few weeks puts
people in danger and potentially gives away where the cameras are set
up. Adding [AI]{.mark} that [detects whether a person is]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} the [photo]{.mark} reduces the error rate to a fraction of
previous attempts---and it improves its accuracy with time]{.underline}.
Capturing and sending fewer images means TrailGuard cameras now last up
to 18 months without having to swap the batteries out. The AI behind the
smart cameras has been used in urban settings for years but hasn't made
an appearance to stop poaching until now. ["[It's never been
used]{.mark} in national parks where we need it the most,\"]{.underline}
says Eric Dinerstein, the Director of Biodiversity and Wildlife at
RESOLVE, a conservation nonprofit and a partner on the TrailGuard AI
project. For cash-strapped national parks trying to stop well-funded
poaching forces that can include anything from machine guns to
[helicopters](https://www.africanparks.org/newsroom/press-releases/update-garamba-national-parks-poaching-crisis),
any help is appreciated. "This is a huge advantage for conservation,"
says Alex Dehgan, [the CEO of Conservation X Labs, a nonprofit looking
to end human-driven extinctions with technology.]{.underline}

#### 11. AI solves ag

**Snow 19**, Jackie Snow, Jackie Snow MIT Technology Review's associate
editor for artificial intelligence and author of the Algorithm,
2/19/2019, "Does AI Hold the Key to a New and Improved "Green
Revolution" in Agriculture?",
<https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/does-ai-hold-key-to-new-green-revolution-in-agriculture/>

B[y 2050, [we'll need]{.mark} to feed [nine billion]{.mark}
people]{.underline} with [about a third less arable land than [we had in
the
1970s](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/02/arable-land-soil-food-security-shortage)]{.underline},
experts estimate. Farmers will need all the help they can get, including
insights gleaned from artificial intelligence, or AI. Developed
carefully---and with the people who will be using it taken into
account---**[[AI can be part of the solution]{.mark} to feeding a
growing world,]{.underline}** according to the [Refresh
report](https://refreshfoodandtech.com/), a document put together by
researchers from Google, university professors, nonprofits, and farmers.
And as an added bonus, some of the [unsustainable practices developed
over the past 70 years]{.underline} could be reversed with more
efficient, AI-driven technology. [T[he G]{.mark}reen [Revolution]{.mark}
was a set of advances that [started in the]{.mark}
19[50s]{.mark}]{.underline} in areas like high-yield crops, synthetic
fertilizers, and irrigation technology that greatly increased food
production, especially in developing countries---saving an [estimated
one billion
people](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/01/forgotten-benefactor-of-humanity/306101/)
from starvation. [But it left in its wake a culture of pesticides,
reduced agricultural biodiversity, and overuse of chemical
fertilizers]{.underline} that deplete the soil and poison waterways. "It
was never meant to be used in the long term," says [Danielle Nierenberg,
the president of Food Tank, a non-profit working to build a better food
system that also worked on the Refresh document.]{.underline} Farmers
were supposed to transition back to organic, Nierenberg adds: It just
never happened because increased yields generated by industrial-scale
farming put pressure on smaller farms to follow suit. One of the main
ways **[[AI could help ag]{.mark}riculture [transition out of]{.mark}
practices forged in [the Green Revolution]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
into a more sustainable future is with precision farming. Until now,
[[there hasn't been an easy way for farmers to learn from historical or
real-time data.]{.underline}]{.mark} But AI-powered programs can combine
data on weather patterns, crop yields, market prices, and more to guide
farmers to planting at the right time, adding the appropriate level of
fertilizers, and harvesting at peak ripeness.

#### 12. Growth solves all problemsThis card is ok but the warrant isn\'t really explained- I think the below bailey card is better, but again be warray of quals- bailey is a climate denier so there are lots of indicts that say hes on the take 

**Integrity 12**, Integrity Management Consulting, Integrity is a
wesbite, 12/6/2012, "A Simple Philosophy: Growth Solves All Problems" ,
https://integritymc.com/a-simple-philosophy-growth-solves-all-problems/

[We believe a simple philosophy that **[growth solves all
problems]{.mark}**.]{.underline}  I say this knowing how difficult the
current economy is and the obstacles the Federal government faces in
funding its initiatives.  [Yet, the needs of the government are not
going away,]{.underline} and those companies positioned best to fill
those needs will continue to do well. [[By]{.mark} [encouraging growth
we]{.mark} [create]{.mark} opportunity internally and have more [avenues
to overcome]{.mark} [challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline}  The up and coming
analyst has an opportunity for a leadership position on the next project
that we win.  [The person whose project is ending has opportunity to be
rolled onto a new and more exciting engagement. [Many]{.mark} of these
[opportunities cease when]{.mark} the [growth is not
present]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### 13. Growth solves every existential risk\-\--abandoning it is disastrous 

**Bailey 15**, Ronald Bailey, Ronald Bailey is an American Libertarian
Scientist Writer, 11/30/2015, "Fast Growth Can Solve Climate Change",
<https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fast-growth-can-solve-climate-change/#:~:text=Greater%20wealth%20also%20means%20higher,ameliorate%20man%2Dmade%20climate%20change>.

As representatives from 196 countries gather in Paris this December to
negotiate a universal climate treaty, [they should keep in mind that
richer is more climate-friendly, especially for developing countries.
Why? Because [faster growth means higher incomes]{.mark}, which
correlate with [lower population growth.]{.mark} Greater [wealth]{.mark}
also [means higher ag]{.mark}ricultural [productivity]{.mark}, freeing
up [land for forests]{.mark} to grow as well as [speedier progress
toward]{.mark} [developing]{.mark} and deploying cheaper [non--fossil
fuel]{.mark} energy [tech]{.mark}nologies.]{.underline} These trends can
act synergistically to ameliorate man-made climate change. [As economic
growth increases incomes, [[fertility tends to
fall]{.mark}](http://www.bit.ly/K8QAde) toward, and even below, the
replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman.]{.underline} [Some
[demographers
argue](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/business/uns-forecast-of-population-growth-may-be-too-high.html)
that world population could peak at around nine billion by the middle of
this century and then begin declining. [Lower]{.mark}
[population]{.mark} growth [means less demand for
energy]{.mark}]{.underline} and other resources than there would
otherwise have been. According to the latest [World Bank
data](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN) on 212
national jurisdictions, [85 countries are currently at or below the
replacement rate, including Japan, China, Russia, Brazil the U.S. and
all of Europe. Total fertility rates in large developing countries like
India, Bangladesh and Mexico are also near the replacement
rate.]{.underline} Economic development initially worsens environmental
externalities such as deforestation and pollution, including the
accumulation of climate-damaging greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and

#### 14. Degrowth is not the solution to the climate crisis\-\--it takes to long and climate change is already here

University of Massachusetts-Amherst, 7/3/21, "Degrowth Policies Cannot

<https://truthout.org/articles/degrowth-policies-cannot-avert-climate-crisis-we-need-a-green-new-deal/>

To the extent that a sharp reduction in economic activity is a positive
goal, **["[degrowth" requires overturning the]{.mark} current [world
order]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[But do we have the luxury to wait for a
new]{.mark} world [order while the]{.mark} catastrophic [impacts
of]{.mark} global [warming are]{.mark} already [upon us]{.mark} and
getting worse with each passing decade[?]{.mark}]{.underline}
World-renowned progressive economist Robert Pollin, distinguished
professor of economics and co-director of the Political Economy Research
Institute at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, is one of the
leading proponents of a global Green New Deal. In this interview, he
addresses the degrowth vs. Green New Deal debate, looking at how
economies can grow while still advancing a viable climate stabilization
project as long as the growth process is absolutely decoupled from
fossil fuel consumption. C.J. Polychroniou: Since the idea of a Green
New Deal entered into public consciousness, the debate about climate
emergency is becoming increasingly polarized between those advocating
"green growth" and those arguing in support of "degrowth." [What exactly
does "degrowth" mean, and is this at the end of the day an economic or
an ideological debate?]{.underline} Robert Pollin: Let me first say that
I don't think that the debate on the climate emergency between advocates
of degrowth versus the Green New Deal is becoming increasingly
polarized, certainly not as a broad generalization. Rather, as an
advocate of the Green New Deal and critic of degrowth, I would still say
that there are large areas of agreement along with some significant
differences. For example, I agree that uncontrolled economic growth
produces serious environmental damage along with increases in the supply
of goods and services that households, businesses and governments
consume. I also agree that a significant share of what is produced and
consumed in the current global capitalist economy is wasteful,
especially much, if not most, of what high-income people throughout the
world consume. It is also obvious that growth per se as an economic
category makes no reference to the distribution of the costs and
benefits of an expanding economy. I think it is good to keep in mind
both the areas of agreement as well as the differences. But what about
definitions: What do we actually mean by the Green New Deal and
degrowth? Starting with the Green New Deal: The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that for the global economy to move
onto a viable climate stabilization path, global emissions of carbon
dioxide (CO2) will have to fall by about 45 percent as of 2030 and reach
net zero emissions by 2050. As such, by my definition, the core of the
global Green New Deal is to advance a global project to hit these IPCC
targets, and to accomplish this in a way that also expands decent job
opportunities and raises mass living standards for working people and
the poor throughout the world. The single most important project within
the Green New Deal entails phasing out the consumption of oil, coal and
natural gas to produce energy, since burning fossil fuels is responsible
for about 70 -- 75 percent of all global CO2 emissions. We then have to
build an entirely new global energy infrastructure, the centerpieces of
which are high efficiency and clean renewable energy sources ---
primarily solar and wind power. The investments required to dramatically
increase energy efficiency standards and to equally dramatically expand
the global supply of clean energy sources will also be a huge source of
new job creation, in all regions of the world. These are the basics of
the Green New Deal as I see it. It is that simple in concept, while also
providing specific pathways for achieving its overarching goals.
"[[Degrowth" cannot come close]{.mark}, on its own, [to delivering a
45-percent emissions cut]{.mark} by 2030, much less a zero emissions
global economy by 2050.]{.underline} Now on degrowth: Since I am not a
supporter, it would be unfair for me to be the one explaining what it
means. So here is how some of the leading degrowth proponents themselves
describe the concept and movement. For example, in a 2015 edited volume
titled, [Degrowth: A Vocabulary for a New
Era](https://vocabulary.degrowth.org/), the volume's editors Giacomo
D'Alisa, Federico Demaria and Giorgos Kallis write that, "The
foundational theses of degrowth are that growth is uneconomic and
unjust, that it is ecologically unsustainable and that it will never be
enough." More recently, a 2021 paper by Riccardo Mastini, Giorgos Kallis
and Jason Hickel, titled, "[A Green New Deal without
Growth?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921800919319615),"
write that "ecological economists have defined degrowth as an equitable
downscaling of throughput, with a concomitant securing of wellbeing." It
is instructive here that, in this 2021 paper, Mastini, Kallis and Hickel
do also acknowledge that degrowth has not advanced into developing a
specific set of economic programs, writing that "[d**egrowth is not a
political platform, but rather an 'umbrella concept'** that brings
together a wide variety of ideas and social struggles."]{.underline}
This acknowledgement reflects, in my view, a major ongoing weakness with
the degrowth literature, which is that, in concerning itself primarily
with very broad themes, it actually gives almost no detailed attention
to developing an effective climate stabilization project, or any other
specific ecological project. Indeed, this deficiency was reflected in a
2017 interview with the leading ecological economist Herman Daly
himself, without question a major intellectual progenitor of the
degrowth movement. Daly says in the interview that he is "favorably
inclined" toward degrowth, but nevertheless demurs that he is "still
waiting for them to get beyond the slogan and develop something a little
more concrete." [This lack of specificity among degrowth proponents
leads to further problems]{.underline}. For example, degrowth
supporters, such as Mastini et al. in their 2021 paper, are clear that
they support the transformation of the global energy system along the
lines that I have described above, from our current fossil fuel-dominant
system to one whose core features are high efficiency and clean
renewable energy sources. Yet in fact, building out this new energy
system will obviously entail massive growth of the global clean energy
system, just as it will equally entail the phasing out --- or degrowth,
if you prefer --- of the global fossil fuel energy system. In my view,
[it is more useful to be specific about which sectors of the global
economy will certainly need to grow --- e.g., the clean energy
system]{.underline} --- [while others, like fossil fuels, contract, as
opposed to invoking sweeping generalities about degrowth.]{.underline}
We can extend this point. For example, I am sure degrowth proponents
would favor major expansions in access to public education, universal
health care, high-quality affordable housing, regenerative agriculture
and the share of the Earth's surface covered by forests. In focusing on
some critical specifics, I would also add that **[[there is no way
that]{.mark} a general project of [degrowth can put the]{.mark} global
[econ]{.mark}omy [onto a]{.mark} viable climate [stabilization
path]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With the COVID-19 recession, the global
economy just went through a powerful natural experiment to demonstrate
this point. That is, during the pandemic in 2020, the global economy
contracted by 3.5 percent, which the International Monetary Fund
[described
as](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2021/01/26/2021-world-economic-outlook-update)
a "severe collapse ... that has had acute adverse impacts on women,
youth, the poor, the informally employed and those who work in
contact-intensive sectors." In other words, [the pandemic produced an
intense period of global "degrowth."]{.underline} This recession did
also produce a decline in emissions, as entire sections of the global
economy were forced into lockdown mode. But the emissions decline
amounted to only [6.4 percent over
2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00090-3). Remember, the
IPCC tells us that we need to cut emissions by 45 percent as of 2030 and
be at zero emissions by 2050. [If the [COVID]{.mark} recession only
[yields a 6.4 percent]{.mark} [emissions reduction despite]{.mark} the
[enormous levels of]{.mark} economic [pain]{.mark}
inflicted,]{.underline} clearly "[degrowth" cannot come close, on its
own, to delivering a 45-percent emissions cut by 2030]{.underline}, much
less a zero emissions global economy by 2050. Economies can still
continue to grow while still advancing a viable climate stabilization
project as long as the growth process is absolutely decoupled from
fossil fuel consumption. Those who see the Green New Deal not only as
the most effective strategy to tackle global warming but also as an
engine growth, such as yourself, rely on the concept of "decoupling," by
which is meant the absolute decoupling of economic growth from carbon
emissions. However, degrowth advocates seem to be arguing that there is
no empirical evidence for absolute "decoupling," and that it's highly
unlikely that it will ever happen. How do you respond to such claims?
[Let's recognize, to begin with, that [people]{.mark} are [still]{.mark}
going to [need]{.mark} to consume energy to [light, heat]{.mark} and
[cool buildings]{.mark}; to power [cars, buses, trains]{.mark} and
air[planes]{.mark};]{.underline} and to operate computers and industrial
machinery, among other uses. As one critical example here, in low-income
economies, delivering adequate supplies of affordable electricity
becomes transformative for people's lives, enabling them, for example,
to adequately light their homes at night rather than relying on kerosene
lanterns. As such, it should be our goal to greatly expand access to
electricity to low-income communities throughout the world, while we are
also driving down CO2 emissions to zero. The solution is for energy
consumption and economic activity more generally to be absolutely
decoupled from the generation of CO2 emissions. That is, the consumption
of fossil fuel energy will need to fall steadily and dramatically in
absolute terms, even while people will still be able to consume energy
resources to meet their various demands. [The more modest goal of
relative decoupling --- through which fossil fuel energy consumption and
CO2 emissions continue to increase, but at a slower rate than overall
economic activity --- is therefore not a solution.]{.underline}
Economies can still continue to grow while still advancing a viable
climate stabilization project as long as the growth process is
absolutely decoupled from fossil fuel consumption. Is absolute
decoupling impossible to accomplish within the context of economic
growth? To date, we have seen some modest evidence --- and I do stress
the evidence is modest --- of absolute decoupling taking place. For
example, between 2000 and 2014, [21
countries](https://www.wri.org/insights/roads-decoupling-21-countries-are-reducing-carbon-emissions-while-growing-gdp),
including the U.S., Germany, the U.K., Spain and Sweden, all managed to
absolutely decouple GDP growth from CO2 emissions --- i.e., GDP in these
countries expanded over this 14-year period while CO2 emissions fell.
This is a positive development, but only a small step in the right
direction. [[The way to]{.mark} deliver a much more rapid pattern of
absolute d[ecoupl]{.mark}ing [is]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} of
course, [[to build out the]{.mark} global clean [energy
economy]{.mark},]{.underline} and to do so quickly. This is a feasible
project. By [my own
estimates](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3239-climate-crisis-and-the-global-green-new-deal),
it requires that [the global economy spend approximately 2.5 percent of
global GDP per year on investments in energy efficiency and clean
renewable energy supplies,]{.underline} [while the global economy grows
at an average rate of about 3 percent per year between now and
2050]{.underline}. The [International Renewable Energy
Agency](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2021/March/IRENA_World_Energy_Transitions_Outlook_2021.pdf)
and [International Energy
Agency](https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050) recently published
studies that reached similar results for the global economy. Focused on
the U.S. economy, the energy economists Jim Williams and Ryan Jones also
reached a similar result, as part of the [Zero Carbon Action
Plan](https://www.unsdsn.org/Zero-Carbon-Action-Plan) project. From this
and related evidence, I conclude that absolute decoupling is certainly a
feasible, though also obviously a hugely challenging, project. But we
can't just talk about it, pro or con. We have to make the investments,
at 2.5 percent of global GDP per year or thereabouts, every year until
2050, to build the global clean energy economy. If we do that, absolute
decoupling will happen. If we don't make those investments, then of
course, absolute decoupling becomes an impossibility. Various
ecologically minded activists are also arguing that the Green New Deal
relies on the use of massive energy resources, including extensive use
of the steel industry, in order to make the transition to a clean,
renewable and net-zero emissions economy, and that what is really needed
instead is a green revolution of the mind, whereby zero energy living is
the ultimate goal. My question is this: Can the Green New Deal deliver
100 percent clean energy? There are several industries in which energy
is consumed intensively. They include steel, cement and paper, along
with, obviously, all forms of transportation. But note that these
industries are energy intensive. They are not necessarily fossil fuel
energy intensive[. If we succeed, through the Green New Deal, in
increasing the efficiency at which these industries consume energy and
we also deliver abundant supplies of clean renewable energy, then the
[problems of]{.mark} dealing with [energy-intensive industries can be
solved.]{.mark}]{.underline} It's true that there will be some specific
areas which will present more difficult challenges. For example, some
parts of steel production rely on furnaces that are operating at very
high temperatures. Reaching these high temperatures are, to date,
difficult to achieve through electricity as opposed to burning coal in a
furnace. This problem will need to be solved over time. One likely
solution could be to rely on laser technology through which the required
high temperatures can be reached with electricity, with the electricity,
in turn, being produced through renewable energy. [[For the first
time]{.mark}, 62 percent of all [renewable energy sources produced
energy at lower costs than]{.mark} the cheapest sources of [fossil fuel
energy]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### 15. Proponents of degrowth are wrong\-\--growth decreases pollution, it doesn't increase it

Andrew **McAfee 20**, a principal research scientist at MIT and the
author of More From Less: The Surprising Story of How We Learned to
Prosper Using Fewer Resources---and What Happens Next, 10/6/20,
<https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-why-degrowth-is-the-worst-idea-on-the-planet/>

For half a century, [[we\'ve been]{.mark} told that [we had to embrace
degrowth]{.mark} in order to save our planet. [We haven\'t
listened.]{.mark}]{.underline} Around the world, human populations and
economies have continued to grow at rates that are virtually
unprecedented in the history of our species. [[Over that]{.mark} same
[span, an]{.mark} unexpected and [encouraging pattern has
emerged]{.mark}: [**The world\'s richest countries** have
learned]{.mark} how [to reduce their footprint]{.mark} on Earth.
**[They\'re polluting less, using less land]{.mark} and [water,
consuming smaller amounts of]{.mark} important [natural
resources]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} doing better** in [many other
ways.]{.mark}]{.underline} Some of these trends are also now visible in
less affluent countries. However, many in the degrowth movement seem to
have trouble taking yes for an answer. The claims I just made are widely
resisted or ignored. Some say they've been debunked. Of course, debate
over empirical claims like these is normal and healthy. Our impact on
our planet is hugely important. But something less healthy is at work
here. As Upton Sinclair put it, "It is difficult to get a man to
understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding
it." Some voices in the conversation about the environment seem wedded
to the idea that degrowth is necessary, and they are unwilling or unable
to walk away from it, no matter the evidence. But evidence remains a
powerful way to persuade the persuadable. The one thing everyone agrees
on is that [[the last 50 years have been]{.mark} a period of
[growth]{.mark}, not degrowth. In fact, growth has never been faster,
except for the 25-year rebuilding period after World War II. The
[population and economic growth rates of the past half-century are
remarkably fast]{.mark} by historical standards. Between 1800 and 1945,
for example, the world's economy grew less than 1.5 percent per year, on
average.]{.underline} Between 1970 and 2019, that average increased to
almost 3.5 percent. It\'s natural to assume that, as this growth
continued, every nation's planetary footprint would only increase. After
all, as people become more numerous and prosperous they consume more,
and producing all the goods and services they consume uses up resources,
takes over ecosystems, and generates pollution. The logic seems ironclad
that our gains have to be the environment's losses. In some important
areas, however, [[a]{.mark} very different [pattern emerged after
1970]{.mark}: [Growth continued, but]{.mark} [environmental harm
decreased]{.mark}. This decoupling occurred [first with
pollution,]{.mark} and first in the rich world[. In the US]{.mark}, for
example, [aggregate levels of six common air pollutants have declined by
77 percent]{.mark}, [even as g]{.mark}ross [d]{.mark}omestic
[p]{.mark}roduct [increased by 285 percent]{.mark} and [population by
60]{.mark} percent.]{.underline} In the UK, annual tonnage of
particulate emissions dropped by more than 75 percent between 1970 and
2016, and of the main polluting chemicals by about 85 percent. Similar
gains are common across the highest-income countries. How were these
reductions achieved? The two possibilities are cleanup and offshoring.
Either rich countries figured out how to reduce their "air pollution per
dollar" so much that overall pollution went down even as their economies
grew, or they sent so much of their dirty production overseas that the
air at home got cleaner. The first of these paths reduces the total
burden of human-caused pollution; the second just rearranges it. The
evidence is overwhelming that rich countries cleaned up their air
pollution much more than they outsourced it. For one, a great deal of
air pollution comes from highway vehicles and power plants, and rich
countries haven't outsourced driving and generating electricity to
low-income ones. In fact, high-income countries haven\'t even offshored
most of their industry. The US and UK both manufacture more than they
did 50 years ago (at least until the Covid-19 pandemic sharply reduced
output), and Germany has been a net exporter since 2000 while continuing
to drive down air pollution. The rest of the world has been exporting
its manufacturing pollution to Germany (to use degrowthers' phrasing),
yet Germans are breathing cleaner air than they were 20 years ago[.
**[Rich countries]{.mark} have [reduced]{.mark} their [air
pollution]{.mark}** not by embracing degrowth or offshoring, but instead
by enacting and enforcing smart regulation.]{.underline} As economists
Joseph Shapiro and Reed Walker concluded in a 2018 study about the US,
"[changes in environmental regulation, rather than changes in
productivity and trade, account for most of the emissions
reductions]{.underline}." Research about the cleanup of US waters also
concludes that well-designed and enforced regulations have successfully
reduced pollution. It is true that the US and other rich countries now
import lots of products from China and other nations with higher
pollution levels. But if there were no international trade at all, and
rich countries had to rely exclusively on their domestic industries to
make everything they consume, they'd still have much cleaner air and
water than they did 50 years ago. As a 2004 Advances in Economic
Analysis and Policy study summarized: "We find no evidence that domestic
production of pollution-intensive goods in the US is being replaced by
imports from overseas." The rich world's success at decoupling growth
from pollution is an inconvenient fact for degrowthers. Even more
inconvenient is China\'s recent success at doing the same.
[[China's]{.mark} export-led, manufacturing-heavy [economy has been
growing at meteoric rates,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[but]{.mark} between
2013 and [2017 air pollution]{.mark} in densely populated areas
[declined by]{.mark} more than [30 percent]{.mark}]{.underline}. Here
again the government mandated and monitored pollution declines and so
decoupled growth from an important category of environmental harm.
[China\'s progress with air pollution is heartening, but it\'s not
surprising to most economists. It\'s a clear example of the
environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) in action.]{.underline} Named for the
economist Simon Kuznets, EKC posits a relationship between a country\'s
affluence and the condition of its environment. [[As GDP per capita
rises]{.mark} from an initial low level, so too does environmental
damage; but as affluence continues to increase, **[the harms level off
and then]{.mark} start to [decline]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The EKC is
clearly visible in the pollution histories of today\'s rich countries,
and it\'s now taking shape in China and elsewhere. Also consider air
pollution death rates around the world. As the invaluable website Our
World in Data puts it, "Rates have typically fallen across high-income
countries: almost everywhere in Europe, but also in Canada, the United
States, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel and South Korea and other
countries. But [rates have also fallen across upper-middle income
countries too, including China and Brazil.]{.underline} In low and
lower-middle income countries, rates have increased over this period."
The EKC is a direct refutation of a core idea of degrowth: that
environmental harms must always rise as populations and economies do.
It\'s not surprising that today\'s degrowth advocates rarely discuss the
large reductions in air and water pollution that have accompanied higher
prosperity in so many places around the world. Instead,
[[degrowthers]{.mark} now [focus]{.mark} heavily [on]{.mark} one kind of
pollution: [g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}as
emission[s]{.mark}.]{.underline} The claims made are familiar ones: that
any apparent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in rich countries
are due to offshoring rather than actual decarbonization. Thanks to the
Global Carbon Project, we can see if this is the case. GCP has
calculated "consumption-based emissions" for many countries going back
to 1990, taking into account imports and exports, yielding the
greenhouse gas emissions embodied in all the goods and services consumed
in each country each year. For several of the world\'s richest
countries, including Germany, Italy, France, the UK, and the US, graphs
of consumption-based carbon emissions follow the familiar EKC. [**[The
US]{.mark},** for example, **[has]{.mark} 22[reduced its]{.mark} total
(not per capita) [consumption-based]{.mark} CO2 [emissions by]{.mark}
more than [13 percent since]{.mark} 2007**]{.underline}. These
reductions are not mainly due to enhanced regulation. Instead, they\'ve
come about because of a combination of tech progress and market forces.
Solar and wind power have become much cheaper in recent years and have
displaced coal for electricity generation. Natural gas, which when
burned emits fewer greenhouse gases per unit of energy than does coal
(even after taking methane leakage into account), has also become much
cheaper and more abundant in the US as a result of the fracking
revolution. To ensure that these greenhouse gas declines continue to
spread and accelerate, we should apply the lessons we\'ve learned from
previous pollution reduction success. In particular, [we should make it
expensive to emit carbon, then watch the emitters work hard to reduce
this expense.]{.underline} The best way to do this is with a carbon
dividend, which is a tax on carbon emissions where the revenues are not
kept by the government but instead are rebated to people as a dividend.
William Nordhaus won the 2018 Nobel Prize in economics in part for his
work on the carbon dividend, and an open letter advocating its
implementation in the US has been signed by more than 3,500 economists.
It\'s an idea whose time has come. Tech progress and price pressure
aren\'t just leading to the demise of coal. They\'re also causing us to
exploit the planet less in many other important ways, even as growth
continues. In other words, EKCs are not just about pollution any more.
[A good place to start examining this broad phenomenon of getting more
from less is US agriculture, where we have decades of data on both
outputs---crop tonnage---and the key inputs of cropland, water, and
fertilizer.]{.underline} [Domestic [crop tonnage has risen
steadily]{.mark} over the years and in 2015 was more than 55 percent
higher than in 1980.]{.underline} [[Over that same period,]{.mark}
though, **[total water]{.mark} used for irrigation [declined by 18
percent]{.mark}, total [cropland by more than 7
percent]{.mark}.**]{.underline} That is, over that 35-year period, US
crop agriculture increased its output by more than half while giving an
area of land larger than Indiana back to nature and eventually using a
Lake Champlain less water each year. This was not accomplished by
increasing fertilizer use; total US fertilizer consumption in 2014 (the
most recent year for which data are available) was within 2 percent of
its 1980 level. The three main [[**fertilizer**s]{.mark} of nitrogen,
potassium, and phosphorus (NKP) [are an interesting]{.mark} case
[study]{.mark}. [Their total US **consumption**]{.mark} (once other uses
in addition to agriculture are taken into account) **has [declined by 23
percent]{.mark} since 1980, according to the United States Geological
Survey**.]{.underline} Yet some within the degrowth movement find ways
to argue that these declines are also an illusion. These materials thus
serve to clearly illustrate the differences in methodology, evidence,
and worldview between ecomodernists like myself and degrowthers. The
USGS tracks annual domestic production, imports, and exports of NKP and
uses these figures to calculate "apparent consumption" each year.
Consumption of each of the three resources has declined by 16 percent or
more from their peaks, which occurred no later than 1998. This seems
like a clear and convincing example of dematerialization---getting more
output from fewer material inputs. As I argue in my book More From Less,
dematerialization doesn't happen for any complicated or idiosyncratic
reason. It happens because resources cost money that companies would
rather not spend, and tech progress keeps opening up new ways to produce
more output (like crops) while spending less on material inputs (like
fertilizers). Modern digital technologies are so good at helping
producers get more from less that they\'re now allowing the US and other
technologically sophisticated countries to use less in total of
important materials like NKP. Forest products provide another clear
example of dematerialization in the US. Total annual domestic
consumption of paper and paperboard peaked in 1999, and of timber in
2002. Both totals have since declined by more than 20 percent. [Could
these be mirages caused by offshoring that's not properly
captured?]{.underline} [That's highly unlikely, as the country is now
onshoring more than it's offshoring.]{.underline} The US has been a net
exporter of forest products since 2009 and is now the world's largest
exporter of these materials. Is the US economy also dematerializing its
use of metals? Probably, but it's hard to say for sure. The USGS tallies
do show dematerialization in steel, aluminum, copper, and other
important metals. But these figures don't include the metals contained
in imports of finished goods like cars and computers. America is a net
importer of manufactured goods, so it could be that we're using more
metal year after year, but that much of this consumption is "hidden"
from official statistics because of imports of heavy, complex products.
However, my estimates indicate that this is extremely unlikely and that
the country is in fact now reducing its overall consumption of metals.

Frank defined a \"[t[ech]{.underline}]{.mark}[nological
[civilization]{.mark}\" as one which had [developed radio]{.mark}

he also calculated how long **[[those]{.mark} technological

Indeed. This is the last variable in the Drake equation---the \"L\"
variable. It is my favorite and the most provocative element of the
equation, in my opinion. Humans are \[now\] about a hundred years into
the technological stage of evolution, so we are very early in the time
horizon of the L variable, which [Frank suggested might be [10,000
years]{.mark}.]{.underline} Considering the challenges humanity faces in
the next 100 years---let alone the next 10,000---[[Frank\'s
prediction]{.mark} may be [optimistic]{.mark}]{.underline}!

#### 17. Anti-growth movements fail\-\--crackdown, and movements fail specifically in the modern era

**Toney, 13**, Simon Toney, University of Sydney, Department of
Government and International Relations, [Anti-Capitalism: A Beginner's
Guide]{.underline}, The perils of 'movementism', pg. 142-144, -FT

Many of these marches, protests and initiatives were very successful on
their own terms. This is to say that they provided a focal point for
activists who might not have had wider contact with concerned citizens
or groups who shared some if not all of their aims and objectives. The
protests were mobilising occasions. They enabled people to learn and
share experiences in an intense environment which heightened the sense
of a great deal being at stake. They also seemed to matter in tangible
as well as intangible ways. Elites certainly gave the impression that
they were concerned about these protests, and this served to reinforce
the feeling that the stakes were high. Huge numbers of police and
military personnel were used to protect conference centres, hotels and
the participants themselves from the protesters. The protests tapped
into popular sentiment and in their own ways affected the climate of
opinion, such that elites had to be responsive to the concerns
articulated by the protesters. So for a while it seemed that protests
and demonstrations were an effective way of bringing activists together
and influenc­ing the actions and policies of global elites. Here, quite
tangibly, was 'the movement'. [However, even [within the movement there
were]{.mark} those who expressed [scepticism]{.mark} about such an
emphasis being given to what had become a mobile carnival of protests
and demonstrations - or 'serial protesting']{.underline} as Naomi Klein
aptly put it. [[Alex Callinicos]{.mark}, to take one notable example,
[offered a critique of]{.mark} what he termed '[movementism']{.mark},
which he equated to the belief that protests and demonstrations would
displace the need for more durable forms of organisation]{.underline},
for the development of a programme and ultimately for capturing power
from elites as KA opposed to merely influencing them in the direction of
more just or equitable policies. [[He predicted]{.mark},
[presciently]{.mark} as it turned out, [that once the initial wave of
energy]{.mark} and enthusiasm for protests ha[d begun to wane, the
shortcomings]{.mark} of this approach [would be
revealed]{.mark}]{.underline} and that in its stead would be left
recrimination and few victories. What Callinicos neglects in his
argument is that one of the reasons why activists focused on protests
and demonstrations is because 'party building' seemed such a tired
formula. [**[Protests were the antidote to the Leninist 'cure]{.mark}'**
as far as many disaffiliated activists were concerned.]{.underline} On
the other hand, it is certainly true that much of the momentum went out
of summit protests over the course of the first decade of the
twenty-first century. This was so for several reasons, which it is worth
recounting to get a sense of the changing context in which
anti-capitalist initiatives took place. Firstly, what became obvious was
the mounting cost to individu­als and groups of taking part in major
demonstrations. As part of the War on Terror unleashed in the wake of
the 9/11 al-Qaeda attacks, [[most states had invested]{.mark}
significantly [in intelligence services]{.mark},
[counter-terrorism]{.mark} initiatives, [surveillance capacity]{.mark}
and police and army training to combat threats to 'civil
security'.]{.underline} This was justified by reference to the threat of
attack from religious extremists. But 'threat' is an elastic term that
can be used to encompass a range of 'extremists' who seem to represent a
threat to law and order. [**[Many]{.mark}** of these [techniques
**were**]{.mark} **now [deployed against those]{.mark} engaged
[in]{.mark} anti-capitalist [protests and
demonstra­tions]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It became familiar for protesters
in, for example, the UK to be confronted by a squad of police officers -
the Forward Intelligence Team (FIT) - brandishing cameras to record the
faces of all those engaged in a protest. Such overt displays of policing
are designed to fulfil two functions. Firstly, they demon­strate to the
public that protests are considered by authorities on the same continuum
as more violent or terroristic activities. Secondly, they are designed
to intimidate participants. Making protestors the subject of overt
[**[surveillance is a]{.mark} Draconian [reminder of who is in
charge]{.mark}'**. The idea is to ramp up the personal cost of being
engaged in such activities, [deterring ordinary people]{.mark} who may
wish to demonstrate their displeasure at government policy or the
actions of global elites.]{.underline} [[This leaves]{.mark}
[behind]{.mark} a rump of [more militant activists]{.mark} who can more
easily be monitored and controlled.]{.underline}

#### 18. Viewing growth as trading off with the environment undermines true progress towards solving for environmental degradation and loss

**Loris, 19**, Nicolas Loris, Nick is an economist who focused on
energy, environmental, and regulatory issues as the Herbert and Joyce
Morgan fellow, 10/23/2019, "Breathe Free: Capitalism Helps Protect the

T[oo often, [we use phrases like "balancing]{.mark} economic [growth
and]{.mark} environmental [protections]{.mark}." [This suggests]{.mark}
[that more growth]{.mark} necessarily [degrades the
environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[But the two aren't]{.mark} mutually
[exclusive]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[When]{.underline}]{.mark} [America
and [the]{.mark} rest of the [world embrace]{.mark} policies rooted in
[economic freedom]{.mark}, both [prosperity and the]{.mark} [environment
flourish]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this instance, you really can have
your cake and eat it, too.

#### 19. Capitalism is sustainable

**Foss et al. 22** (Nicolai J. Foss , Peter G. Klein, and Samuele
Murtinu, Foss has a works at the Copenhagen business school, Klein works
for Baylor, and many more qualified authors, September 2022, accessed on

need a reset, and neither does management theory\",
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956522122000215)

[What these critics are describing here is not capitalism but "cronyism"
(]{.underline}[[Rubin,
2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956522122000215#bib71)).
As]{.underline} [[Klein et al.
(2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956522122000215#bib47)
argue, confusing capitalism and cronyism is a long-standing
mistake.]{.underline} Classic proponents of the free-enterprise system
such as [Schumpeter
(1942)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956522122000215#bib73)**[¸]{.underline}**
[Mises
(1922)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956522122000215#bib57),
or [Friedman
(1962)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956522122000215#bib27)
describe capitalism as a mode of social organization which entails that
(1) productive resources are (mostly) privately owned, (2) markets are
used to allocate resources, products and services, (3) individuals and
groups are (mostly) free to engage in economic activity without
centralized control or interference from the state, and (4) institutions
exist that enable (1) to (3), notably by making sure that property
rights to resources are precisely delineated and enforced, which enables
investments and make the costs of exchange relatively low (for
qualifications, reservations, etc., see [Klein et al.,
2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956522122000215#bib47)).
These are the "primitives" of capitalism as a system. Other
oft-mentioned aspects (whether positive, negative, or purely
descriptive), such as free movements of goods, capital, and labor across
borders, are derived from these. [[Critics of cap]{.mark}italism [take
for granted]{.mark} that capitalism is responsible for rampant
pollution, increasing inequality, concentration of industries, and so
on, but rarely engage in [systematic, empirically grounded]{.mark},
comparative [institutional analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both theory
and a careful study of the historical record suggest that
[**[non-capitalist systems experience]{.mark} these [problems]{.mark}**
[to a far greater degree than cap]{.mark}italist systems]{.underline}.
For example, in a market economy, well-defined property rights can keep
pollution and other sustainability issues under control ([Rothbard,
1982](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956522122000215#bib70));
in contrast, the worst known cases of industrial pollution occurred in
the twentieth century in the non-capitalist countries behind the Iron
Curtain. Freedom of contract will secure dynamism and social mobility
and thus counteract tendencies to concentration of industries and
capital and increasing inequality ([Dean and Geloso,
2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956522122000215#bib20),
[Nikolaev and Bennett,
2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956522122000215#bib60),
Bennett & Nikolaev, 2016). Socialist economies, and capitalist economies
characterized by a substantial degree of government intervention,
experience stagnation and social strife. The basic vision outlined by
the above thinkers has been remarkably correct when applied to the
economic history of the last two hundred years. [[When]{.mark}ever
[capitalist principles have been applied they]{.mark} have tended to
[bring prosperity, education, improvements in health, and equality of
opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Leeson,
2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956522122000215#bib51)).
[The [wealth generated by]{.mark} the operation of [free markets provide
the resources]{.mark} needed [to deal with]{.mark} many [environmental
issues]{.mark}.]{.underline} Defining property rights to hitherto
unowned resources, that is, pollution rights and making these tradeable
has become an instrument of allocating such rights to their
highest-valued uses and stimulate innovation in technologies that reduce
CO~2~ emissions. Free markets and borders that are open to the movement
of products and services enable the diffusion of such technologies. In
short[, [free markets have]{.mark} increasingly [been instrumental in
dealing with ecological challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline} Among the
various socio-economic systems, it is clear that "[**[cap]{.mark}italism
[comes closest to meeting]{.mark} the [conditions of efficiency]{.mark}
and [maximum well-being]{.mark},** even if no capitalist economies meet
these conditions perfectly]{.underline}" ([Klein et al.,
2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956522122000215#bib47)).

#### 20. Growth is good.

**Caden 19**, Art Carden, AIER PhD in economics at Samford, 12/12/2019,
"Growth Is Good", <https://www.aier.org/article/growth-is-good/>

[[Growth is good]{.mark}. Through history, economic [growth]{.mark} in
particular has [alleviated]{.mark} human [misery]{.mark},
**[improved]{.mark}** human **[happiness]{.mark} [and
opportunity]{.mark}**, and [lengthened]{.mark} human
[lives]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Wealthier societies are]{.mark} more
[stable]{.mark},]{.underline} offer better living standards,
[[produce]{.mark} better [medicines]{.mark}, and [ensure]{.mark} greater
[autonomy]{.mark}, [greater fulfillment]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} more
sources of [fun]{.mark}]{.underline}. If we want to sustain our trends
of growth, and [the overwhelmingly [positive outcomes for
societies]{.mark} that come with it]{.underline}, every individual must
become more concerned with the welfare of those around us.

#### 21. Growth is still the answer to the **world's** economic problems

Peterson 22, Nick Peterson, Nick Peterson is a writer for the financial
times, 4/10/2022, "Growth is still the answer to the world's economic
problems",
https://www.ft.com/content/e1242c8e-e918-4eb5-9bf1-33d32c098b65

In 1931, John Maynard Keynes published a short essay entitled "Economic
Possibilities for Our Grandchildren" in which he considered the
feasibility of solving what he called "the economic problem". According
to Keynes, the issue of scarcity ought to have been dealt with by the
early 21st century. [[Decades of]{.mark} capitalist [progress]{.mark}
would [leave society with]{.mark} the [capacity to produce]{.mark} the
[resources needed]{.mark} to guarantee everyone a good standard of
living.]{.underline} [The problem,]{.underline} at this point, [would be
finding ways to spend well-earned leisure time]{.underline}. More than
90 years later, it is fair to say that [[Keynes' prediction]{.mark} of
abundance [was not wrong]{.mark}]{.underline}: the scale of production
possibilities available to us in 2022 is well beyond what he probably
imagined in 1931. But "economic problems" have not gone away. In fact,
[there is an intellectual debate raging over how to define our primary
issues]{.underline} and what to do about them. [Is finding a way to
create more [growth]{.mark} still the [key to]{.mark} a good
[society]{.mark}]{.underline}? Or is our primary economic problem
finding a way to deal with inequality and environmental degradation? The
most recent contribution to this debate comes from Jonathan Haskel,
professor of economics at Imperial College Business School, and Stian
Westlake, chief executive of the Royal Statistical Society. They situate
themselves firmly in the "more growth" camp. [Their book, Restarting the
Future, suggests that [capitalism can]{.mark} be revitalised by
[promot]{.mark}ing "further [investment]{.mark}" [in]{.mark} what they
call "**[intangible]{.mark} [capital]{.mark}**]{.underline}". This
thesis builds on their last collective effort, Capitalism without
Capital, published in 2017. In that book, Haskel and Westlake outlined
how the [capitalist [system]{.mark} has [shifted]{.mark} from investment
in physical capital]{.underline}, such as machines and factories,
[towards intangible capital,]{.underline} such as software. Importantly,
this kind of capital behaves differently from physical assets: [the
[more]{.mark} it [makes up the econ]{.mark}omy]{.underline}, the more it
can change the dynamics of capitalism itself.
