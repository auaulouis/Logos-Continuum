**[[Congress must move quickly to pass a bill cutting the deficit and
helping]{.underline}]{.mark}** Americans struggling
[**[with]{.underline}** **[rising prices]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[. The
Congressional calendar is very short, and soon the opportunity will be
lost]{.underline}**. The Congressional Budget Office, (CBO) recently
released its annual budget report with much more bad news about
government debt. Although the deficit temporarily drops for two years,
the debt picture over the next decade and beyond is very bleak.
According to the CBO, in just five years, our national debt will reach
the size of our entire economy, and by 2032 our net debt will grow to an
astronomical \$37 trillion --- something that's only happened once in
our history, at the end of World War II. Meanwhile, **[inflation is over
8 percent, its highest point in 40 years, with gas prices at record
levels. But finally, there is hope Congress will begin to address both
the debt crisis and high prices]{.underline}**. Congressional
**[[Dem]{.underline}]{.mark}**ocrat[**[s]{.underline}** **[are crafting
a deficit cut package without imposing the large cuts to vital domestic
benefits]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[many others have long demanded. By
[raising revenue and cutting the deficit,]{.mark} it
[would]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[bring]{.underline}]{.mark}** some
**[[relief to Americans battling inflation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[Such a bill must pass as a budget reconciliation
measure]{.underline}** to avoid an almost certain Republican filibuster
--- **[and [the opportunity to use the reconciliation process expires on
Sept. 30. But there's even less time]{.mark} than that to get it done.
With members of Congress home for August and]{.underline}** much of the
fall because it's **[election season,
Dem]{.underline}**ocrat**[s]{.underline}** really **[need to
finish]{.underline}** work **[by the end of July. [Kicking the
can]{.mark}]{.underline}** down the road to a post-election lame duck
**[[is not an option]{.underline}]{.mark}** since reconciliation at that
point will be unavailable without a new budget resolution, which is not
in the cards. **[[Recent]{.mark}]{.underline}** Democratic
**[[efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}** to pass a budget package
**[[collapsed because the White House]{.mark}, progressives [and]{.mark}
two moderate]{.underline}** Senate Democrat**[s including]{.underline}**
Joe **[[Manchin]{.underline}]{.mark}** (D-W.Va**[.) [could not reach a
deal. But this time]{.mark},]{.underline}** Sen. **[[Manchin is
engaged]{.mark} with Senate Democratic leaders [in talks]{.mark}
supported [by the]{.mark} Biden [administration]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The talks have dragged on for several weeks and need to conclude soon
before the clock runs out. Every American should be concerned about our
ever-**[[growing deficits]{.underline}]{.mark}** and debt. Large
deficits, going back to Ronald Reagan, can **[[fuel inflation
and]{.mark} slow]{.underline}** economic **[growth by [boost]{.mark}ing
[interest rates. Higher rates]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in turn, can
**[[discourage businesses from borrowing to create new]{.mark} [jobs and
hurt consumers]{.mark} using credit cards. High debt also risks our
national security because it makes us vulnerable to foreign lenders.
China alone holds \$1 trillion in U.S. bonds]{.underline}**. Our
mounting debt means taxpayers must shell out \$8 trillion over the next
decade to bond holders in return for lending us the money. To put that
in perspective, that **[debt service cost]{.underline}** is **[almost 50
percent greater than all federal spending]{.underline}** last year.
**[Not a penny of that goes for new schools]{.underline}**, struggling
**[seniors or]{.underline}** sick **[veterans]{.underline}**. Just the
opposite**[, high debt service squeezes out money to fund those
needs]{.underline}**. Escalating debt even risks budget cuts for those
services. I saw this first-hand as the House Budget Committee Democratic
staff director for 20 years. The last legislation to substantially
reduce the deficit in 2011 cut discretionary spending targets by \$900
billion which threatened essential programs like Head Start, Pell grants
for college students, environmental clean-up and veterans' health care.
**[[The]{.mark} Democrats' budget [package would achieve as much as
\$700 billion in deficit reduction]{.mark} through tax hikes on
corporations that have avoided paying their fair share, stricter tax
enforcement [and]{.mark} [Medicare drug cost
savings]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While it's a modest step relative to the
size of the problem and much more work remains,
**[[this]{.underline}]{.mark}** new effort **[[represents real
progress]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The package would also importantly help
Americans battling high prices because **[lower deficits]{.underline}**
should **[result in lower consumer demand. [The bill would]{.mark} also
[assist]{.mark} seniors struggling [with skyrocketing]{.mark}
prescription [drug costs]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It would also help
working families with medical bills by extending subsidies for critical
Affordable Care Act insurance premiums slated to sharply increase before
the end of the year.]{.underline}** Finally, **[the plan would [reduce
energy costs and contribute to the battle against climate change by
creating tax breaks for clean]{.mark} energy
[tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}**. This new CBO report and the
pressing need to address high prices should serve as clarion calls for
action. **[Dem]{.underline}**ocrat**[s]{.underline}** **[need to put
these talks on a fast track]{.underline}** by passing it **[before time
runs out]{.underline}**.

Needing a Win, Enters a Sprint for His Economic Agenda," *New York
Times*,
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/business/economy/biden-infrastructure-bill.html)

**[[Many steps remain]{.mark} before]{.underline}** Mr. **[Biden can
sign both bills into law]{.underline}** --- but his party has given
itself only a few weeks to complete them. **[The [infrastructure]{.mark}
bill [is]{.mark} [written. But the House and Senate must agree
on]{.mark}]{.underline}** the spending
**[[programs]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[revenue]{.underline}]{.mark}**
increases **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** overall
**[[cost]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the larger bill,
**[[balancing]{.mark} the desires of
[progressives]{.mark}]{.underline}** who see a generational chance to
expand government to address inequality and curb climate change **[[and
moderates]{.underline}]{.mark}** who have pushed for a smaller package
and resisted some of the tax proposals to pay for it. It is a timeline
reminiscent of what Republicans set for themselves in the fall of 2017,
when they rushed a nearly \$2 trillion package of tax cuts to President
Donald J. Trump's desk without a single Democratic vote. **[[Sticking to
it will require sustained support from]{.mark} administration
officials]{.underline}** both in and out of Washington. In the first
three weeks of August, Mr. **[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}** dispatched
cabinet members to 31 states to barnstorm for the infrastructure bill
and his broader economic agenda, with events in the districts of
moderate and progressive members of Congress, according to internal
documents obtained by The New York Times. His secretaries of
transportation, labor, interior, energy, commerce and agriculture sat
for dozens of local television and radio interviews to promote the
bills. Even with those efforts, **[[the initial clash
over]{.underline}]{.mark}** advancing **[[the
budget]{.underline}]{.mark}** this week **[[was resolved with a flurry
of calls from]{.underline}]{.mark}** Mr.
**[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}**, top White House officials and senior
Democrats to the competing factions in the House. Congressional leaders
say they have spent months laying the groundwork so that their party can
move quickly toward consensus. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California told
colleagues in a letter on Wednesday that "we have long had an eye to
having the infrastructure bill on the president's desk by the Oct. 1,"
the date when many provisions in the bipartisan package are slated to go
into effect. Committee leaders have been instructed to finish their work
by Sept. 15, and rank-and-file lawmakers have been told to make their
concerns and priorities known quickly as they maneuver through
substantive policy disagreements, including whether it should be as much
as \$3.5 trillion and the scope of Mr. Biden's proposed tax increases.
"I'm sure everybody's going to try their best," said Representative John
Yarmuth of Kentucky, the House Budget Committee chairman. "Some
committees will have it rougher than others." Senator Ron Wyden of
Oregon, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has been releasing
discussion drafts of proposals to fund the \$3.5 trillion budget
reconciliation spending --- the larger bill that Democrats plan to move
without any Republican support --- including raising taxes on high
earners and businesses. On Wednesday, he provided granular details of a
plan to increase taxes on the profits that multinational companies earn
and book overseas. "I'm encouraged by where we are," Mr. Wyden said in
an interview. Democratic leaders and the White House have pushed
analyses of their proposals that speak to core liberal priorities; on
Wednesday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader,
released a report suggesting the two bills combined would "put our
country on the path to meet President Biden's climate change goals of 80
percent clean electricity and 50 percent economywide carbon emission
reduction by 2030." White House economists released a detailed report
this week claiming the spending Mr. Biden supports, like universal
prekindergarten and subsidized child care, would expand the productive
capacity of the economy and help reduce price pressures in the future.
While Republicans are not expected to get on board with the larger
spending bill, they are still making their concerns known, labeling the
bill socialist and a spending spree and claiming it will stoke inflation
and drive jobs overseas. Mr. **[[Biden can pass the entire agenda now
with only]{.mark} [Dem]{.mark}ocratic [votes]{.mark}, [but the party's
thin majorities]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- **[including no room for even
a single defection]{.underline}** in the Senate --- **[[complicates the
task]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Ms. Pelosi said on Wednesday that the House
would "write a bill with the Senate, because there's no use our doing a
bill that is not going to pass the Senate, in the interest of getting
things done." As part of an agreement to secure the votes needed to
approve the \$3.5 trillion budget blueprint on Tuesday, Ms. Pelosi gave
centrist and conservative Democrats a commitment that she would only
take up a reconciliation package that had the support of all 50 Senate
Democrats and cleared the strict Senate rules that govern the fast-track
process. "I'm not here to pass messaging bills --- I'm here to pass
bills that will actually become law and help the American people," said
Representative Stephanie Murphy of Florida, one of the Democrats who
initially announced that she would not support advancing the budget, but
ultimately joined every Democrat in advancing it. For moderates, Ms.
Pelosi's commitment served to shield them from potentially tough votes
on provisions that the Senate may reject. It also signaled the
**[[political]{.underline}]{.mark}**
realitie**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[could]{.mark} [shape the
final legislation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. No Democrat will want to vote
on a large spending bill doomed for failure. **[[It will
be]{.underline}]{.mark}** Mr. **[[Biden's job to lead his coalition to a
bill]{.mark} [that can pass]{.mark}]{.underline}** muster **[[with
moderates and progressives]{.underline}]{.mark}** alike --- and to
convince every holdout that failure is not an option.

Biggest Risk Is Geopolitical Unrest," Bloomberg,
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-20/inflation-s-biggest-risk-is-geopolitical-unrest)

**[Inflation isn't just a domestic problem]{.underline}**. Sure,
year-on-year inflation hitting 7%, the highest rate in four decades, is
threatening to derail Joe Biden's presidency. As my Bloomberg colleague
John Authers has written, the inflationary trend appears broad and
durable. Yet now as before, **[[inflation is a geopolitical
phenomenon]{.mark}, which is [rooted]{.mark}]{.underline}** partly
**[[in rising]{.mark} global [tensions and could have deeply corrosive
effects on the U.S.-led world]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[order]{.underline}**. **[That's what happened]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[the last time the U.S. faced this problem, [from the late 1960s to
the early 1980s]{.mark}]{.underline}**. "To all Americans," Ronald
Reagan said while running for president in 1980, inflation had become
\"something as violent as a mugger, as frightening as an armed robber
and as deadly as a hit man.\" **[The causes were closely tied to global
affairs]{.underline}**. **[In the late 1960s]{.underline}**, the
combined costs of the Vietnam War and President Lyndon B. Johnson's
Great Society programs sent prices rising. In the
19**[70s]{.underline}**, the chief drivers were soaring energy costs and
supply disruptions caused by the Yom Kippur War of 1973 and then the
Iranian revolution of 1978-1979. It was a vicious cycle: Geopolitical
upheaval caused economic upheaval, which then added to the underlying
global instability. **[[High oil costs and scarce supplies caused
ruptures within the democratic world]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as Japan,
France and other U.S. allies scrambled to cut bilateral deals with oil
producers. **[[Inflation ate away at]{.mark} an American [defense
budget]{.mark} that was already falling]{.underline}** as a result of
post-Vietnam retrenchment. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger worried
that economic chaos might destabilize the Western world. It certainly
contributed to a general malaise in America and other advanced
democracies, feeding fears that the Soviet Union --- then benefitting
from record oil prices --- might win the Cold War after all. "Can
Capitalism Survive?" Time magazine famously asked in 1975. Only when the
Federal Reserve finally broke the inflationary cycle with bone-crushing
interest rates did the U.S. regain its geopolitical footing. **[Today,
rising]{.underline}** energy **[costs are again pushing prices
higher]{.underline}**. **[The messy divorce of]{.underline}** economies
between the **[U.S. and China is disrupting supply chains and generating
inflationary pressure]{.underline}**. **[The economic messiness provoked
by]{.underline}** another geopolitical breakup ---
**[Brexit]{.underline}** --- **[isn't helping]{.underline}** matters.
Not least, the inflation surge has resulted from the massive stimulus
that governments pumped into their economies in response to Covid, the
greatest global crisis of this century. **[[In countries where
there]{.mark} is lots of [revolutionary kindling, inflation can provide
the fatal spark]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Historically, [rising prices
contribute]{.mark}d [to]{.mark} [political
upheaval]{.mark}s]{.underline}** such as the French Revolution, which
touched off a quarter-century of war in Europe, and the Arab Spring,
whose effects are still roiling the Middle East. This month, a doubling
of fuel prices triggered protests, revolt and then Russian-backed
repression in Kazakhstan. **[[There's]{.mark} probably [more of this to
come]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In late 2021, the Food and Agriculture
Organization at the United Nations reported that global food prices had
reached their highest point in a decade. **[Look out for geo-economic
turbulence]{.underline}**, as well. Argentina, the European Union,
Russia and other countries have restricted the export of commodities
such as grain to keep domestic food prices manageable. **[[If Washington
ratchets up interest rates]{.underline}]{.mark}** to tame rising prices,
**[[it could]{.mark} unintentionally [batter deeply indebted
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}** that have already lost years, even
decades, of economic progress due to Covid. Indeed, when the Fed slayed
inflation in the early 1980s, a decade-long Latin American debt crisis
was part of the collateral damage. Finally, there is the question of
what will happen to the U.S. Biden isn't entirely wrong to argue that
inflation is actually a sign of strength: The U.S. economy rebounded
quickly from Covid, fueling demand that is outstripping supply. Yet
inflation is rarely a good-news story.
**[[Inflation]{.underline}]{.mark}** is psychologically demoralizing
because it makes growth meaningless, and stagnation crippling, for
people whose real wages are in decline. It fosters a sense that the
people are victims of forces that their leaders cannot control. It
**[gives credence to arguments that America's true problems are at home,
rather than abroad, and thus [threatens to create a more distracted,
inward-looking superpower just as global threats are
intensifying]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The damage isn't hypothetical: As
John Ferrari of the American Enterprise Institute points out, **[[the
U.S. defense budget is already at risk of being strangled by the
"inflation anaconda]{.underline}]{.mark}**." The 5% bump that Congress
approved for the Pentagon this year sounds impressive, but only until
one considers that inflation is running at 7% and the military is
particularly exposed to rising costs for energy and materials such as
steel. **[As inflation builds up, Pentagon is forced to build down ---
just as China is racing to expand its military capabilities, Russia is
threatening a major conflict in Eastern Europe and relations with Iran
deteriorate]{.underline}**. The **[Biden]{.underline}** administration
**[appears to be recognizing,]{.underline}** perhaps belatedly, **[that
rising prices pose a severe threat]{.underline}** to its domestic agenda
and political fortunes. **[Inflation may]{.underline}** also **[have
nasty geopolitical effects in a world that hardly seemed stable
before]{.underline}**.

bill," 24 June 2022
<https://www.rechargenews.com/energy-transition/not-a-ton-of-time-left-clock-ticking-louder-on-bidens-bid-to-pass-key-us-climate-bill/2-1-1243159>

Time waits for no-one. And, **[when it comes the US environmental
agenda, no-one can be hearing the clock ticking louder
than]{.underline}** US President Joe **[[Biden,]{.mark} who [has six
weeks and counting to get a slimmed-down version of legislation critical
to his]{.mark} ambitious national [climate action plans]{.mark} through
Congress]{.underline}** before members recess and later turn their
attention to re-election in November . **[[It won't be
easy]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the stakes are high. **[[This is]{.mark}
likely [Biden's last chance to]{.mark} get significant [traction
on]{.mark} addressing the [climate]{.mark} crisis [that is crafted
exclusively by his administration]{.mark} and party and in the process
get US leadership on global climate action -- [a central focus of his
presidency]{.mark} -- back on track.]{.underline}** Early polls show
Democrats will lose control of one or both houses of Congress in
mid-term elections, an outcome that would reset the balance of power in
Washington for Biden's remaining two years in office. Having Democrats
in the minority in the House of Representatives and/or Senate would
constrain the US president's ability to proactively advance the country
down a path to meet its 2030 Paris Agreement pledge to slash greenhouse
gas emissions 50-52% from 2005 levels. "There is still hope we can get
something across the finish line but not a ton of time is left," said
Mike Williams, senior fellow, at the Center for American Progress, the
leading progressive Democratic think tank in Washington, DC. "In an
election year, it is well-known that the August recess is pretty much
the drop-dead time for legislation before the end of Congress. The odds
of coming back post-August recess and getting meaty things done between
then and the election are low historically," he said. With Biden's
approval rating lower than any US president of the modern era at this
stage of their term and 70% of Americans believing the country is moving
'in the wrong direction', the political momentum clearly favours the
Republicans. The GOP has no incentive to help an unpopular leader
struggling with crises on multiple fronts pass a potentially large
partisan spending bill they believe would further stoke 40-year-high
inflation -- currently the number one concern of US voters. While many,
perhaps most, **[[Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark}** reject Biden's
contention that climate change is an "existential threat" to US national
security, some **[[are open to bipartisan measures]{.mark} that address
its more pronounced economic, environmental, and health
impacts]{.underline}**. A case in point was last year's \$1trn
infrastructure law, the first significant US investment in climate
resilience and a rare, high-profile political win for Biden. Yet, it is
Biden's open hostility toward the oil and gas industry and his stated
policy aim to "get rid of fossil fuels" that limits cooperation with
Republicans who favour an all-of-the-above approach with energy. In
their view, it is Biden that is artificially creating a national
security risk by pushing the energy transition too fast with an overly
rosy narrative that the US can replace conventional fuels and thermal
resources with relative ease and expense. Senate \'reconciliation\'
challenge Complicating any push on climate by Biden is the
fast-approaching end of the federal fiscal year on 30 September that
will close the window for Democrats in the evenly divided 100 seat
Senate to use a special parliamentary procedure called reconciliation to
pass major legislation. **[[A reconciliation bill]{.mark} that expedited
certain budgetary legislation [could pass with a party-line majority of
50 votes]{.mark}]{.underline}** plus an affirmative tie-breaking vote
cast by US Vice President Kamala Harris in her capacity as president of
the Senate. The procedure overrides filibuster rules that may otherwise
require a supermajority of 60 votes. Reconciliation bills can deal with
spending, revenue, and the federal debt limit, and the Senate can pass
one bill per year affecting each subject. Policy changes that are
extraneous to the budget are limited. In the House of Representatives,
where Democrats have a 220-209 majority , the procedure also applies but
has minor significance as there is no supermajority requirement. Last
December, Democrats sought to use reconciliation to move the \$1.75trn
Build Back Better bill, half the size of Biden's original climate and
social spending proposal. The House had passed its version the previous
month on a party-line vote. The manoeuvre collapsed in spectacular
fashion after Joe Manchin, a moderate West Virginia Democrat and swing
vote, announced his opposition citing reservations about the cost and
potential inflationary impacts. Build Back Better contained about
\$550bn in climate-related funding including \$350bn in new or extended
multi-year clean energy-related tax credits, about six times as much as
the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the nation's largest
clean energy investment to date. Analysis by independent researcher
Rhodium Group showed that passage of both the infrastructure law and
Build Back Better (as then written) was critical to the US achieving the
interim 2030 emissions goal. Rhodium's Pathways to Paris argued that
**[[measures in both packages]{.mark} could enable and [speed up clean
tech]{.mark}nology [deployment and on their own cut emissions
significantly]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As well, they could also reduce
consumer and compliance costs of federal and state actions, and when
combined with congressional actions, "put the target within reach".
**[Without the cost reduction assistance of congressional actions,
federal and state leaders will face higher technical and political
hurdles as they pursue the ambitious policies necessary for Paris
compliance, according to the analysis]{.underline}**. Smaller bill
possible? Climate this year has taken a back seat to mounting challenges
that are threatening to submerge Biden's administration. Soaring food
and fuel prices. Supply chain congestion. A wave of nationwide gun
violence. Runaway illegal immigration along the southern border.
Hundreds of Americans dying each day from a virus in Covid-19 that has
already claimed more than 1 million lives. Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
"The biggest issue we are seeing with climate legislation is there is a
lot of competing priorities," said Aaron Barr, principal consultant at
Wood Mackenzie, speaking at a conference last month. "So many things are
taking air out of the room that makes it difficult to pass legislation."
Even Build Back Better, etched in the public mind with signature policy
failure by Biden and Democrats in Congress, no longer exists in name.
**[[The White House has]{.mark} now [recast]{.mark} it as
[Build]{.mark}ing a [Better]{.mark} America]{.underline}**. "I think it
really hinges on can a deal around a smaller reconciliation bill get put
together in the next month or two," said Sasha Mackler, energy programme
director at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, DC, a think-tank
focused on bipartisan policy solutions. "It has to be smaller because of
inflationary pressures and this desire to focus the bill on a couple of
issues where **[[there is broad support]{.underline}]{.mark}** and a
need for legislation," he added, noting that **[[all party factions
could embrace about \$300bn]{.mark} in 10-year clean energy-related tax
credits]{.underline}**. Whether moderate and progressive Democrats can
compromise over the cost, language, and scope of any new bill remains to
be seen. After giving a grim judgment of prospects for a climate bill,
**[[Manchin now says publicly he will support the tax
credits]{.underline}]{.mark}** if half the revenue raised from taxes
goes to reduce the federal deficit. In May, **[he told
Axios]{.underline}** that **[his early talks]{.underline}** with Senate
Majority Leader Charles Schumer on Building a Better America **[were
"encouraging]{.underline}** to a certain extent", but added, "There
could be truly nothing. That's all I can tell you."

Economic Plan as Inflation Antidote" June 17, 2022

**[[The White House and]{.mark} congressional
[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} [are in advanced talks on
legislation]{.mark}]{.underline}** that aims **[[to fight
inflation]{.mark}, rein in the deficit and revive parts

**[economic agenda]{.underline}**. The contours of a potential deal
remain under negotiation, but **[the package would likely include
capping the price of insulin \-- a key medicine for diabetics \-- and
federal investments in both clean energy and fossil
fuels]{.underline}**, according to people briefed on the talks. It would
also further reduce the budget deficit and boost taxes on the wealthy,
corporations or both, they said. **[[An agreement could come together as
soon as next week]{.underline}]{.mark}**, two people said, though others
were more cautious, noting many details remain to be resolved. Climate
provisions are a particularly tricky area, and differences could still
scotch a deal, one person said. The people familiar with the talks asked
not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the negotiations, in
which Senator Joe **[[Manchin]{.underline}]{.mark}** of West Virginia
[**[plays a central role]{.underline}**. **[The president has hinted at

Press, citing capping insulin costs as an example. "We can reduce it to
35 bucks a month and get it done. We have the votes to do it. We're
going to get that done. I can't get it all done." **[Democrats are
desperate for a policy response to inflation]{.underline}**, which is at
a four-decade high and, unless curbed, is all but certain to cost them
control of the House, Senate or both in November's midterm elections.
Gasoline, a critical component of the American household budget, costs
\$5 a gallon on average nationwide, according to the AAA motor club, and
hit a record earlier this month. Seeking to quell the surge in living
costs, the Federal Reserve accelerated its monetary-tightening campaign
this week, executing the biggest interest-rate hike since 1994. The
moves have driven fresh losses on Wall Street and increased the odds of
a recession that would only compound Biden's political troubles. Biden
ordered a record release from the nation's oil reserves earlier this
year to try to curb gasoline prices, but to little effect. Now, he's
looking to help households save money on everyday needs like drugs,
utilities and internet access, and by cutting the government's budget
deficit, which reached a record \$3.13 trillion in fiscal 2020, during
the pandemic. **[The president sought to cut drug prices and raise taxes
on the wealthy in last year's]{.underline}** economic plan, called
**[Build Back Better, which Manchin killed]{.underline}** in December by
saying he'd vote against it. Democrats need all 50 of their Senate
caucus members to pass legislation in the 100-seat chamber under the
so-called budget-reconciliation process, which can bypass a Republican
filibuster. The White House for months has refused to publicly comment
on any talks with Manchin. The West Virginia senator bristled at White
House statements late last year as he, other Democrats and the
president's aides negotiated. The relationship between the White House
and Manchin was so damaged in the aftermath of that chapter that some
White House officials still avoid saying his name aloud. Other Elements
"**[[The president remains engaged with Congress. This is an important
part of his economic agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Cecilia Rouse,
chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said Friday at
the White House. Along with the new legislation, Biden has recently
touted a provision of the infrastructure law enacted last year that
offers full rebates for some home-internet plans for low-income
households. He's also urged Congress to pass separate legislation that
would encourage domestic manufacturing of semiconductors to help ease
global shortages that have contributed to rising prices for cars and
consumer electronics. Together, he argues the measures would provide
Americans a counterbalance for higher food and gasoline prices. The
administration is also clamoring for new Covid funding from Congress,
but as of now there are no plans to roll that into any reconciliation
deal, two of the people said. Senate Duo **[[Biden
met]{.underline}]{.mark}** Wednesday [with]{.mark} Senate Majority
Leader Chuck **[[Schumer and]{.underline}]{.mark}** House Speaker Nancy
**[[Pelosi]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with the trio **[[discussing next
steps]{.mark} on a fresh bill to pass through the reconciliation
process. [The White House called the measure their "shared agenda of
tackling inflation]{.mark} and lowering prices and transitioning from a
historic economic recovery to stable, steady growth"]{.underline}** in a
statement on the meeting. The talks have largely narrowed to two men:
Schumer and Manchin. The basis for their discussions is legislation the
House passed last year that would raise federal revenue by \$1.5
trillion over a decade, one person said. White House spokespeople didn't
immediately respond to a request for comment on the talks. A person
familiar with **[[Manchin's]{.underline}]{.mark}** thinking said he is
**[[continuing to negotiate]{.mark} with Schumer]{.underline}**, and
hasn't set a July 4 deadline for reaching a deal. The person said energy
and climate is just one of the issues still being worked on. The House
bill included a surtax on wealthy Americans, expanded levies on
investments, had a 15% minimum rate for corporations and a tax on stock
buybacks. Savings in drug costs could push so-called pay-fors in the
bill to \$1.8 trillion over a decade. Manchin has insisted that at least
half of the new tax revenue in the bill go to reducing the deficit.
Energy Components Senator Kyrsten Sinema, however, has signaled
objections to many tax increases, leaving unclear which revenue measures
might make a final agreement. The Arizona Democrat this week said she's
focused on talks on new gun-safety legislation. Energy provisions remain
among the sticking points in the negotiations on the reconciliation
bill, with Manchin \-- whose state still produces much of the nation's
coal supply \-- advocating for fossil-fuel suppliers.
**[[Proponents]{.mark} of the legislation [are aiming for a deal]{.mark}
soon that can pass [before members]{.mark} of Congress [leave for

President Biden appears on track to secure major anti-gun violence
victories in the coming weeks, but high inflation threatens to
overshadow them. The Senate broke nearly 30 years of gridlock when it
advanced a bipartisan gun safety bill Tuesday. It's also set to confirm
what would be the first permanent director of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in seven years. It will give
Democrats accomplishments to tout as the midterms get closer, but
activists note the president largely remained on the sidelines in public
on both the bill and the push for Steve Dettelbach's confirmation as ATF
director. "As activists, we barely heard from the White House in the
week since the shooting, and the president made one prime-time speech
and seemed to call it a day," Zeenat Yahya of March for our Lives told
The Hill's Alex Gangitano and Brett Samuels. **[Biden's focus has
largely been on solving record levels of inflation]{.underline}** and
high gas prices, and **[there are few signs that he will pivot to other
issues as the White House continues to take heat over rising
prices]{.underline}**. Some Democrats like Rep. Ro Khanna (Calif.) are
criticizing Biden for not doing enough to solve inflation, though the
president is also facing opposition from key members when attempting to
pass measures like a three-month gas tax holiday. Congress is likely to
reject the gas tax suspension as a way to lower costs, with Speaker
Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) among those who
have previously expressed concerns, The Hill's Rachel Frazin reports.

dmr

For all his many political struggles, President Joe **[Biden
is]{.underline}** quietly **[delivering on one of the
central]{.underline}** --- and most implausible --- **[promises of his
campaign: restoring a sense of]{.underline}** normalcy and
**[bipartisanship to the legislative process.]{.underline}** The latest
example is an apparent bipartisan deal on gun regulation, which finally
puts vague Republican rhetoric on school security and mental health into
action while also embracing modest Democratic proposals on such matters
as background checks and red-flag laws. The bill will probably not
dramatically alter the level of gun violence in the US. But it should do
some good, and re-establishes the idea that Congress can act in response
to dramatic events. Before the gun deal, of course, **[Biden worked with
Congress to deliver the kind of bipartisan infrastructure legislation
that both his predecessors only talked about. There have also been many
more obscure bills, ranging from legislation changing the regulation of
ocean shipping to a major overhaul of the US P]{.underline}**ostal
**[S]{.underline}**ervice. Bipartisan science funding legislation has
been languishing for months now, but that's due to boring House-Senate
disagreements that are being worked out by a conference committee --- a
process so old-school it had become basically forgotten in Washington.
**[Progress is also being made on bipartisan bills about such thorny
issues as Chinese investment in US companies and antitrust scrutiny of
big technology companies.]{.underline}** Much of this work is happening
through a process I like to call the Secret Congress: Members quietly
working together while allowing the political press to focus on Hunter
**[Biden's]{.underline}** laptop, which books are in which school
libraries, the latest Marjorie Taylor Greene tweet or any of the million
other controversies that engage the body politic. The Secret Congress
dynamic, of course, is one reason why it's difficult for Biden to secure
credit for delivering on this promise. During Barack Obama's presidency,
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was open about the fact that he
was reluctant for Republicans to engage constructively on any topic lest
the passage of bills come to reflect positively on an incumbent
president he hoped to defeat. Biden has a much lower public profile than
his recent predecessors. And while his **[team has been constructively
engaged on all these issues]{.underline}**, it's been a quiet form of
engagement that aims to be helpful without hogging the spotlight or
preventing the members themselves from owning the process. Conservative
firebrands found plenty of (real and fake) controversies with which to
fill the air and maintain a sense of combat even as they collaborated on
policy. Meanwhile, quite apart from Biden's efforts, there is the fact
that Donald Trump's presidency helped break down the doors of
ideological dogmatism on the right. Republicans don't talk about it much
these days, but the Trump administration's willingness --- led by
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin --- to work with House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on the CARES Act is the
only reason the 2020 elections didn't turn into a party-destroying
landslide. A free-market approach that devastated consumer spending
power and led to liquidated many businesses would have ruined the
economy, ruined Trump's political standing, and driven the GOP into the
ground. Trump lack of ideological purity, and Democrats' willingness to
bargain in good faith, saved the economy and the Republican Party ---
and perhaps opened the doors to further rounds of creativity. Alas,
Biden has not had nearly such good fortune with his economic management.
The multiple inflationary shocks --- first a fiscal stimulus that spent
too much too quickly, then a central bank that was probably too slow to
react, then a war in Ukraine that's ravaged the supply side of the
global economy --- have wrecked Biden's public standing. When a
president is unpopular due to bad economic news, the public doesn't give
him credit for anything. And columnists of all stripes are wont to
criticize an unpopular leader. But the fact remains that **[important
elements of Biden's agenda have succeeded]{.underline}**, notably
including a Russia policy that has secured strong bipartisan and even
international support despite the economic cost. The cloak of
unpopularity, meanwhile, makes it even easier for bipartisanship to
continue. In his current state, **[Biden is not politically threatening
to Republicans, so they have no reason to avoid collaborating on bills
they happen to like.]{.underline}** A new proposal from Republican
senators Mitt Romney, Richard Burr and Steve Daines to consolidate and
simplify various family support programs in a way that would cut poverty
and reduce marriage penalties has earned some cautious praise from
Democratic Senator Michael Bennet and could be the basis for more
bipartisan work. At the end of the day, life as a legislator is more fun
if you get to legislate. **[Sheer exhaustion with the tedium of
obstruction has helped make Biden's approach work]{.underline}**.

WASHINGTON (AP) --- **[Democrats are going to hold onto the House after
November's midterm elections]{.underline}**. They will pick up as many
as four seats in the Senate, expanding their majority and Overcoming
internal dissent that has helped stifle their agenda. **[As the
challenges confronting President Joe Biden intensify, his predictions of
a rosy political future for the Democratic Party are growing
bolder.]{.underline}** The assessments, delivered in speeches,
fundraisers and conversations with friends and allies, seem at odds with
a country that he acknowledged this week was "really, really down,"
burdened by a pandemic, surging gas prices and spiking inflation.
**[Biden's hopeful outlook tracks with a sense of optimism that has
coursed through his nearly five-decade career and was at the center of
his 2020 presidential campaign]{.underline}**, which he said was built
around restoring the "soul of America." In a lengthy Oval Office
interview with The Associated Press on Thursday, **[Biden said part of
his job as president is to "be confident."]{.underline}** "Because I am
confident," he said. "**[We are better positioned than any country in
the world to own the second quarter of the 21st century]{.underline}**.
That's not hyperbole. That's a fact." While presidents often try to
emphasize the positive, there is a risk in this moment that Biden
contributes to a dissonance between Washington and people across the
country who are confronting genuine and growing economic pain. Few of
Biden's closest political advisers are as bullish about the party's
prospects as the president. In interviews with a half-dozen people in
and close to the White House, there is a broad sense that Democrats will
lose control of Congress and that many of the party's leading candidates
in down-ballot races and contests for governor will be defeated, with
Biden unable to offer much help. The seeming disconnect between Biden's
view and the political reality has some in the party worried the White
House has not fully grasped just how bad this election year may be for
Democrats. "I don't expect any president to go out and say, 'You know
what, 'We're going to lose the next election,'" said Will Marshall,
president and founder of the Progressive Policy Institute, which is in
regular contact with the White House's policy team. What might serve
Biden well instead, Marshall said, would be "a sober sense of, 'Look,
we're probably in for a rough night in November and our strategy should
be to remind the country what's at stake.'" The White House is hardly
ignoring the problem. After years in which Democrats have operated in
political silos, there is a greater focus on marshaling resources. Jen
O'Malley Dillon, Biden's 2020 campaign manager who now serves as one of
his deputy chiefs of staff, runs the political team from the West Wing
along with Emmy Ruiz, a longtime Texas-based Democratic political
consultant. O'Malley Dillon coordinates strategy among the White House,
the Democratic National Committee and an array of outside party groups.
Cedric Richmond, a former Louisiana congressman who co-chaired Biden's
2020 campaign and was one of his closest White House advisers, left for
a job with the DNC in April. He characterized the move as underscoring
the administration's full grasp of the importance of the midterms. "We
understand that you cannot govern if you can't win," Richmond said in an
interview. "We are treating it with that sense of urgency." The
president's political message is being honed by Mike Donilon, a longtime
Biden aide who is a protector of Biden's public image, and veteran party
strategist Anita Dunn, who is returning to the White House for a second
stint. Richmond praised Dunn's political instincts and said he believes
she will team with O'Malley Dillion, White House chief of staff Ron
Klain and others to promote messaging that many in their own party may
underestimate. **["If I had a penny for every time Democrats counted Joe
Biden or Kamala Harris out, I'd be independently
wealthy,"]{.underline}** Richmond said. Biden turned to Dunn during an
especially low political moment in February 2020, giving her broad
control of his then-cash strapped presidential campaign as it appeared
on the brink of collapse after a disastrous fourth-place showing in the
Iowa caucus. Barely a week later, Biden left New Hampshire before its
primary polls had even closed, ultimately finishing fifth. But he took
second in Nevada, won South Carolina handily and saw the Democratic
establishment rally around him at breakneck speed in mere days after
that. O'Malley Dillon then joined the campaign and oversaw Biden's
general election victory. A similar reversal of political fortune may be
necessary now. But where White House officials last year harbored hopes
that voters could be convinced of Biden's accomplishments and reverse
their dismal outlook on the national direction, aides now acknowledge
that such an uphill battle is no longer worth fighting. Instead, **[they
have pushed the president to be more open about his own frustrations ---
particularly on inflation --- to show voters that he shares their
concerns and to cast Republicans and their policies as obstacles to
addressing these issues.]{.underline}** Though he has increasingly
expressed anger about inflation, **[Biden has publicly betrayed few
concerns about his party's fortunes this fall. opting instead for
relentlessly positivity]{.underline}**. "I think there are at least four
seats that are up for grabs that we could pick up in the Senate," the
president told a recent gathering of donors in Maryland. "And we're
going to keep the House." Biden meant Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,
with potential longer shots in North Carolina or Florida possibly
representing No. 4. Some aides admit that assessment is too optimistic.
They say the president is simply seeking to fire up his base with such
predictions. One openly laughed when asked if it was possible that
Democrats could pick up four Senate seats. The party's chances of
maintaining House control may be bleaker. Still, Tim Persico, executive
director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is
charged with defending the party's narrow majority, said Biden remains
an asset. **["We love when the president is speaking to the
country,"]{.underline}** Persico said. **["There'll always be
frustrations. I totally get that. But I think he's his own best
messenger."]{.underline}**

the President to Get Exactly What He Wants,"
[https://d-nb.info/1164077325/34)](https://d-nb.info/1164077325/34)//BB)

**[One of the most important presidential strategies]{.underline}** in
the legislative arena **[is]{.underline}** (trying) **[to set the agenda
of Congress]{.underline}** (see Wood 2009 for an extensive overview;
Cohen 2012; Edwards and Wood 1999; Light 1999). The reasoning behind
this is straightforward: **[[Since presidents have]{.mark} only [few
tools]{.mark} at hand [to sway lawmakers]{.mark} on how they cast their
ballot, [the focus]{.mark} of the White House [is]{.mark} set at an
earlier stage: by already [influencing what is considered in the first
place]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Compared with the legislative prevalence
of executives in parliamentarian democracies, presidents in the United
States are clearly less able to dominate the agenda space. Yet based on
his constitutional right to recommend legislation deemed necessary and
appropriate (Art. II, Sec 3, U.S. Constitution), it is primarily the
resources of the executive branch - i.e., the departmental
bureaucracies, and the Executive Office of the President - which put the
president into the position to exert policy leadership via drafting
legislative proposals. Unmatched by any other single legislators or even
Congress as a whole, John W. Kingdon is right to argue that "\[...\]
**[[no other]{.underline}]{.mark}** single
**[[actor]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the political system
**[[has]{.underline}]{.mark}** quite **[[the]{.mark} [capability of the
president to set agendas]{.mark}]{.underline}**." (Kingdon 2003, 24).
Previous research has shown that defining the agenda is a promising
strategy for the White House. Presidential initiatives, both major and
minor ones, almost always find their way into the legislative hopper
(Cameron and Park 2008, 51f; Cohen 2012, 24ff; Edwards and Barrett 2000,
116ff). Accordingly, legislation proposed by the administration makes up
between 30% and 50% of the congressional calendar, while the remaining
proportion is initiated by members of Congress, is based on recurring
pieces of legislation, and are reaction to external events or imminent
crises (Edwards and Barrett 2000, 112ff; Taylor 1998, 377ff; Theriault
2002). While this indeed makes the president the single most important
agenda-setter, it also demonstrates that he does not dominate the
legislative agenda of Congress (Sinclair 2006, 255--63). We can mainly
identify three mechanisms how **[[presidential]{.mark}
[agenda-setting]{.mark}]{.underline}** affects the lawmaking process in
Congress. First, it **[[enables the president to define the boundaries
of]{.mark} [policies under consideration, and]{.mark} in this way to
[structure the following deliberation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In this
sense, **[[agenda setting is]{.underline}]{.mark}** first and foremost
about **[[obtaining]{.underline}]{.mark}** the Deutungshoheit - i.e.,
the **[[prerogative of interpretation]{.underline}]{.mark}** - **[[over
the]{.mark} policy [debate]{.mark}]{.underline}** through setting the
terms of the debate, **[[moving first on certain policy aspects]{.mark},
and [via framing and priming of core arguments]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Edwards and Wood 1999; Eshbaugh-Soha and Peake 2005). George W. Bush,
for instance, during his 2000 presidential campaign advertised his plans
for massive across the board tax breaks which, at that time, were
perceived as a mere "pipe dream" on both sides of the political spectrum
(Milbank 2001). Cutting taxes, and especially to this extent, did not
rank high among the priorities of lawmakers nor the American public. The
arrival of Bush in the White House, however, completely changed the
dynamics of debate. It put the tax cut proposal upfront of the
legislative agenda during his first half year as president, and
Democrats in the end had to accept an amount of tax breaks which came up
to more than double of what they called reasonable six months before
during the election campaign. Bill Clinton, on the other hand, was
largely rolled by the issue dynamics in the debates regarding the
overhaul of the Internal Revenue Service in 1997. Favoring only minor
reforms, he had to concede early on to pressures from the public and
Congress who, fueled by several major scandals, thirsted for a
largescale reorganization of the IRS instead of a fine-tuning approach
preferred by Clinton (Broder 1997). Of course, these are only two
illustrations highlighting how presidents can succeed but also fail in
setting the tone of the debate from early stages and through this
pre-structure the outcome of the lawmaking process. Second,
**[[pres]{.mark}idential [leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}** at the
agenda-setting stage **[[helps]{.mark} to [overcome collective
action]{.mark} [problems]{.mark} within Congress and
among]{.underline}** its 535 legislators [**[by providing a focal
point]{.underline}** **[around which other]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[political [actors']{.mark} policy [positions]{.mark} can
[crystalize]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Cameron and Park 2008; Cohen 2012;
Neustadt 1991, 8f). The USA PATRIOT Act can serve as a prime example in
this regard, on which the New York Times stressed that "\[b\]y and
large, the House and Senate bills both use as a starting point a
proposal sent to Capitol Hill nearly two weeks ago by the White House."
(Lewis and Pear 2001). Since lawmakers in Congress today only have
scarce resources to draft their own bills, presidential input from the
beginning is often highly appreciated. Yet, a proposal from the White
House furthermore fulfills the role of first mover draft upon which the
subsequent debate can be structured. In this sense, it both offers a
distinct policy outline upfront and provides guiding posts for the
further deliberation process. Third, agenda-setting offers the White
House the opportunity to highlight its priorities, how they are
distributed across various policy issues, and in which way policies
should be packaged (Rudalevige 2005, 437ff; Wayne 2009b, 317ff).
**[[Because]{.mark} the [resources of any administration to lobby
Congress]{.mark} [are not infinite and]{.mark} the [multiple]{.mark}
political [arenas are usually]{.mark} heavily [crowded with
myriad]{.mark} policy [items]{.mark} and problems striving to be solved,
[the White House needs to prioritize]{.mark} its policy
agenda]{.underline}**. **[[This involves]{.underline}]{.mark}**, among
other things, to **[[select]{.mark} some [issues]{.mark}]{.underline}**
over others, **[[decide]{.mark} about their
[sequencing]{.mark}]{.underline}**, how to pursue them, **[[and how
much]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[political [c]{.mark}apital
it]{.underline}** wants or **[needs [to spend]{.mark}]{.underline}** on
any given item. Therefore, the administration will focus on certain
policies with more attention, on others with less, depending on the
prioritization by the president but also upon other considerations, such
as the overall density of the policy agenda or imminent pressures of the
time. **[[The trick is to not overwhelm Congress with]{.mark} the
president's [initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Lyndon B. Johnson
famously quipped, "Congress is like a Whiskey drinker. You can put an
awful lot of whiskey into a man if you just let him sip it. But if you
try to force the whole bottle down his throat at one time, he'll throw
it up." (cited in Rudalevige 2002, 113). **[Thus, [the failure to
prioritize]{.mark} easily [leads to overload of]{.mark} Pennsylvania
Avenue with [Congress]{.mark} at the one end, [and]{.mark} to [excessive
demands and exhaustion for the White House]{.mark} at the other end. The
rocky start of the [Clinton]{.mark} administration [underlines
this]{.mark} argument: since [the White House did not pursue a
'rifle-approach' to define clear policy priorities]{.mark} for its
initial months and then execute them, [it got lost in]{.mark}
[numerous]{.mark} legislative [battles and mine-fields]{.mark} early on
in its first year. [Instead it followed a 'shotgun-approach']{.mark} by
addressing as many issues as possible at once [leading to an overkill
and chaos]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Rockman 1996; Sinclair 2000b).

### PC Works -- Biden

dmr

For all his many political struggles, President Joe **[Biden
is]{.underline}** quietly **[delivering on one of the
central]{.underline}** --- and most implausible --- **[promises of his
campaign: restoring a sense of]{.underline}** normalcy and
**[bipartisanship to the legislative process.]{.underline}** The latest
example is an apparent bipartisan deal on gun regulation, which finally
puts vague Republican rhetoric on school security and mental health into
action while also embracing modest Democratic proposals on such matters
as background checks and red-flag laws. The bill will probably not
dramatically alter the level of gun violence in the US. But it should do
some good, and re-establishes the idea that Congress can act in response
to dramatic events. Before the gun deal, of course, **[Biden worked with
Congress to deliver the kind of bipartisan infrastructure legislation
that both his predecessors only talked about. There have also been many
more obscure bills, ranging from legislation changing the regulation of
ocean shipping to a major overhaul of the US P]{.underline}**ostal
**[S]{.underline}**ervice. Bipartisan science funding legislation has
been languishing for months now, but that's due to boring House-Senate
disagreements that are being worked out by a conference committee --- a
process so old-school it had become basically forgotten in Washington.
**[Progress is also being made on bipartisan bills about such thorny
issues as Chinese investment in US companies and antitrust scrutiny of
big technology companies.]{.underline}** Much of this work is happening
through a process I like to call the Secret Congress: Members quietly
working together while allowing the political press to focus on Hunter
**[Biden's]{.underline}** laptop, which books are in which school
libraries, the latest Marjorie Taylor Greene tweet or any of the million
other controversies that engage the body politic. The Secret Congress
dynamic, of course, is one reason why it's difficult for Biden to secure
credit for delivering on this promise. During Barack Obama's presidency,
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was open about the fact that he
was reluctant for Republicans to engage constructively on any topic lest
the passage of bills come to reflect positively on an incumbent
president he hoped to defeat. Biden has a much lower public profile than
his recent predecessors. And while his **[team has been constructively
engaged on all these issues]{.underline}**, it's been a quiet form of
engagement that aims to be helpful without hogging the spotlight or
preventing the members themselves from owning the process. Conservative
firebrands found plenty of (real and fake) controversies with which to
fill the air and maintain a sense of combat even as they collaborated on
policy. Meanwhile, quite apart from Biden's efforts, there is the fact
that Donald Trump's presidency helped break down the doors of
ideological dogmatism on the right. Republicans don't talk about it much
these days, but the Trump administration's willingness --- led by
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin --- to work with House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on the CARES Act is the
only reason the 2020 elections didn't turn into a party-destroying
landslide. A free-market approach that devastated consumer spending
power and led to liquidated many businesses would have ruined the
economy, ruined Trump's political standing, and driven the GOP into the
ground. Trump lack of ideological purity, and Democrats' willingness to
bargain in good faith, saved the economy and the Republican Party ---
and perhaps opened the doors to further rounds of creativity. Alas,
Biden has not had nearly such good fortune with his economic management.
The multiple inflationary shocks --- first a fiscal stimulus that spent
too much too quickly, then a central bank that was probably too slow to
react, then a war in Ukraine that's ravaged the supply side of the
global economy --- have wrecked Biden's public standing. When a
president is unpopular due to bad economic news, the public doesn't give
him credit for anything. And columnists of all stripes are wont to
criticize an unpopular leader. But the fact remains that **[important
elements of Biden's agenda have succeeded]{.underline}**, notably
including a Russia policy that has secured strong bipartisan and even
international support despite the economic cost. The cloak of
unpopularity, meanwhile, makes it even easier for bipartisanship to
continue. In his current state, **[Biden is not politically threatening
to Republicans, so they have no reason to avoid collaborating on bills
they happen to like.]{.underline}** A new proposal from Republican
senators Mitt Romney, Richard Burr and Steve Daines to consolidate and
simplify various family support programs in a way that would cut poverty
and reduce marriage penalties has earned some cautious praise from
Democratic Senator Michael Bennet and could be the basis for more
bipartisan work. At the end of the day, life as a legislator is more fun
if you get to legislate. **[Sheer exhaustion with the tedium of
obstruction has helped make Biden's approach work]{.underline}**.

**[The American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs

and the Democrats\' narrow majorities in Congress]{.underline}**. And
**[both pieces of legislation have been integral to the nation\'s

the country against the damage caused by new variants. On foreign
policy, Biden has enjoyed considerable success strengthening NATO and
ratcheting up economic sanctions against Russia while providing critical
aid to Ukraine. As New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote about
his off-the-record lunch with the President, \"What I felt afterward was
this: For all you knuckleheads on Fox who say that Biden can\'t put two
sentences together, here\'s a news flash: He just put NATO together,
Europe together and the whole Western alliance together---stretching
from Canada up to Finland and all the way to Japan---to help Ukraine
protect its fledgling democracy from Vladimir Putin\'s fascist
assault.\" **[None of this erases the significant challenge global
inflation has on American families]{.underline}**. To be sure, **[the
President has taken steps to address this by shoring up key ports to
alleviate supply]{.underline}** chain problems. The Federal Reserve has
just instituted the largest rate hike since 1994 to curb inflation

### AT Winners Win: PC Finite -- Biden

#### Biden's pc is finite -- he has limited opportunities to pass recession solutions

The universe of possibilities for the Biden administration radically
expanded after the Democrats clinched the Senate majority, but the
increase in **[[p]{.mark}olitical [c]{.mark}apital [isn't
infinite]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[When deciding which problems to
tackle first]{.underline}**, President Joe **[Biden should prioritize
initiatives that address the pandemic while moving the nation toward
long-term goals for public health and green-energy
stimulus]{.underline}**. Biden can learn from the experience of Barack
**[Obama]{.underline}**, whose **[focus on
health]{.underline}**-insurance **[reform provoked a midterm backlash
and]{.underline}** probably **[forfeited a chance to boost the country
out of the Great Recession sooner]{.underline}**. He should heed the
words of Winston Churchill who urged, "never let a good crisis go to
waste." **[Because crises are times when the public understands that
change is necessary, it's possible to make deep and lasting
reforms.]{.underline}** President Franklin D. Roosevelt understood this
when he focused parts of his New Deal on long-term alterations to
America's economic structure, such as Social Security and the National
Labor Relations Board. These policies not only contributed to the
recovery from the Great Depression --- the reason for Roosevelt\'s
election --- but created a more equal and stable economy in which
workers had more bargaining power and old people didn't have to live in
penury. **[The U.S. was in the depths of the Great Recession when Obama
took office]{.underline}** in 2009. With the benefit of unified
Democratic control of Congress, he passed **[a]{.underline}** fairly
substantial **[stimulus]{.underline}**. But it **[was]{.underline}**
still **[too small to make more than a modest dent]{.underline}** in the
recession. It was too weighted toward tax cuts and it didn't include
much of a bailout for underwater homeowners. Instead, **[[Obama spent
much of his]{.mark} political capital on [passing]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** Affordable Care Act, commonly known as
**[[Obamacare]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Now, it's true that health
insurance was, and is, one of the country's biggest problems. And it's
also true that Obamacare substantially reduced the ranks of the
uninsured, which was a big, important victory. But the system Obama
crafted was a compromise, which left the problem of ruinously high costs
mostly unaddressed. The legislation failed to satisfy many on the left,
with a few now even labeling it as mass murder for not making deeper
reforms. Meanwhile, Obamacare remained unpopular throughout Obama's term
in office and may have substantially contributed to the Democrats'
catastrophic midterm election losses in 2010. Alternate histories are
difficult to imagine, but it seems likely that **[[had Obama spent
his]{.mark} 2009 political capital [on things more directly related to
the recession]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- such as more infrastructure
spending, a bigger bailout for underwater homeowners and a stronger
welfare state --- **[[he\'d have realized a higher return on that
p]{.mark}olitical [c]{.mark}apital]{.underline}**. In other words, **[a
crisis does present an opportunity for long-term reforms, but it's best
to use that opportunity for reforms that address the immediate
crisis]{.underline}**. **[The Democratic victories in]{.underline}** the
**[Georgia]{.underline}** Senate runoffs **[have given Biden an
unexpected opportunity to pass major legislation]{.underline}** in the
first year of his presidency, instead of relying on executive action and
the faint hope of bipartisan compromise. **[The left will be clamoring
for major action]{.underline}** on health care and a variety of **[other
momumental issues, but [Biden needs to spend his p]{.mark}olitical
[c]{.mark}apital [on reforms that are]{.mark}]{.underline}** also
**[[tied to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the COVID-19 pandemic and
**[[the]{.mark} resulting [recession]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
The first priority is public health. COVID-19 exposed deep and
catastrophic weaknesses in the U.S. public health institutions. Right
now, vaccination is proceeding at a glacial pace due to an uncoordinated
rollout that dumped vaccines in the lap of state public health agencies
utterly unequipped to rapidly inoculate the entire populace. Biden needs
to come right out of the gate with a coordinated, well-funded
vaccination plan that reaches maximum vaccination rates as fast as
possible. In doing so, he also needs to bolster public health agencies
and revitalize and reform both the Centers for Disease Control and the
Food and Drug Administration after years of neglect. This will be a
bigger challenge than is popularly realized because of the possibility
that vaccine-resistant virus strains will emerge. **[Biden will need to
reorient much of the U.S. economy toward vaccine production and
distribution]{.underline}** until COVID-19 has been decisively beaten
all around the world. **[[It will take a lot of money
and]{.underline}]{.mark}** a lot of [**[will]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
After the virus is beaten, the U.S. economy will still linger in
recession unless the government acts decisively to boost demand. The
best tool for doing this, as usual, is infrastructure investment. And
the rapid progress in solar power and batteries means that Biden has a
unique opportunity to address the climate crisis at the same time. A
huge build-out of solar power and electric-car charging stations,
including subsidies to rapidly replace fossil fuel plants and gasoline
vehicles, will ensure that the U.S. economy comes roaring back while
making huge steps toward decarbonization. Public health and green
infrastructure should be the top priorities for Biden in 2021 and 2022.
Yes, **[there are lots of other things in America that need
reform]{.underline}**, including health care. But **[the realities of
the political system mean these will have to wait]{.underline}**.
Reforms must fit the crisis of the day; **[[Biden can't afford to get
sidetracked on a quixotic quest to fix everything]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that's wrong with the American economy.

Political capital is frequently used as a short hand for the diverse
range of attributes and advantages a leader brings with them to power
and develops in office. Compared to other forms of 'capital' it remains
under theorised. Since Pierre Bourdieu first outlined it, scholars have
viewed political capital either as being synonymous with personal skills
or a description of wider contextual attributes, particularly the link
between leader and public. It is frequently seen as analogous to
financial capital: [a political leader has a **fixed stock** of capital
that they can spend, hoard, fritter or gamble.]{.underline} This paper
takes a first look at the literature and applies it to 't Hart's
approaches to leadership study, drawing on examples predominantly from
US and UK politics. Following Lopez (2002) it takes the view that
political capital is both 'personal' (in terms of their own skills) and
'political' (in terms of events, institutional resources and context). A
politician with skills and attributes can use this to shape the context
in which they operate, creating a 'positive multiplier' as the personal
and political reinforce each other. Where events can also overwhelm
leaders and expose flaws and personality weaknesses, a 'negative
multiplier' takes effect. However, unlike money in the bank, [political
capital is **finite** and subject to depreciation as part of 'a natural
trajectory' whereby support and power is **lost over
time**.]{.underline} Yet this trajectory is not always uniform. [The
loss is inevitable]{.underline} but the rate and shape may not be.

### L -- Restrictions Cost PC

#### Lack of political willpower, confusion, and pervasive lobbying ensure emerging tech regulation depletes Biden PC

**Kang 22 --** NYT tech policy reporter (Cecilia, "As Europe Approves
New Tech Laws, the U.S. Falls Further Behind," New York Times, 4-22-22,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/22/technology/tech-regulation-europe-us.html>)
//sg

In the United States, [Congress has not passed a single piece of
comprehensive regulation]{.underline} to protect internet consumers and
[to rein in the power of its technology giants]{.underline}. It's not
for lack of trying. [Over 25 years, dozens of federal privacy bills have
been proposed and then **ultimately dropped** without bipartisan
support.]{.underline} With every major hack of a bank or retailer,
lawmakers have introduced data breach and security bills, all of which
have withered on the vine. A flurry of speech bills have sunk into the
quicksand of partisan disagreements over freedoms of expression. And
antitrust bills to curtail the power of Apple, Amazon, Google and Meta,
the owner of Facebook and Instagram, have sat in limbo amid fierce
lobbying opposition. Only two narrow federal tech laws have been enacted
--- one for children's privacy and the other for ridding sites of
sex-trafficking content --- in the past 25 years. "[Inertia is too kind
of a word]{.underline} to describe what's happened in the United States;
there's been a **[lack of will, courage and understanding of the problem
and technologies]{.underline}**," said Jeffrey Chester, the executive
director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a public interest group.
"And consumers are left with no protections here and lots of confusion."
[The prospects that any legislation will pass imminently are
**dim**]{.underline}, though regulations at some point are almost
inevitable because of the way tech touches so many aspects of life. Of
all the proposals currently in front of Congress, an antitrust bill that
would bar Apple, Alphabet and Amazon from boosting their own products on
their marketplaces and app stores over those of their rivals has the
best shot. A co-author of the bill, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of
Minnesota, said Democratic leaders had promised it would go to a vote by
this summer. But even that bill, with bipartisan support, faces an
uphill climb amid so many other priorities in Congress and a fierce tech
lobbying effort to defeat it. If history is a guide, **[[the path toward
U.S. tech regulation will be long]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It took
decades of public anger to regulate the railroads through the creation
of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887. It took nearly 50 years
from the first medical reports on the dangers of cigarettes to the
regulation of tobacco. There's no single reason for the sludge of
progress in Congress. [**[Proposals have been caught in the age-old
partisan divide over how to protect consumers while also encouraging the
growth of business. Then there are the hundreds of tech lobbyists who
block legislation that could dampen their profits]{.mark}**. Lawmakers
have also at times **failed to grasp the technologies** they are trying
to regulate]{.underline}, turning their public foibles over tech into
internet memes. [Tech companies have taken advantage of that knowledge
blind spot]{.underline}, said Tom Wheeler, a former chairman of the
Federal Communications Commission. "It's what I call the 'big con,'
where the [tech companies spin a story that they are doing magic and
that if Washington touches their companies with regulations they'll be
responsible for breaking that magic]{.underline}," he said. In the
vacuum of federal regulations, states have created a patchwork of tech
rules instead. California, Virginia, Utah and Colorado have adopted
their own privacy laws. Florida and Texas have passed social media laws
aimed at punishing internet platforms for censoring conservative views.
[Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Microsoft said they supported federal
regulations. But when pressed, some of them have fought for the most
permissive versions of the laws that have been under consideration.
Meta, for instance, has pushed for weaker federal privacy legislation
that would override stronger laws in the states.]{.underline} In
response, [many of the tech companies mobilized an **extensive lobbying
and marketing campaign** to defeat the bill.]{.underline} Through a
trade group, Amazon claimed in television and newspaper ads that the
bill would effectively end its Prime membership program. Kent Walker,
Google's chief legal officer, wrote in a blog post that the legislation
would "break" popular products and prevent the company from displaying
Google maps in search results. Ms. Klobuchar said the companies' claims
were hyperbole. She warned that by fighting the proposal, tech companies
might be choosing the worse of two difficult options. "They are letting
Europe set the agenda on internet regulation," Ms. Klobuchar said. "At
least we listened to everyone's concerns and modified our bill." The
inaction may appear surprising given that Republicans and Democrats are
ostensibly in lock step over how tech companies have morphed into global
powerhouses. "Consumers need confidence that their data is being
protected, and businesses need to know they can keep innovating while
complying with a strong, workable national privacy standard," said
Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi. "The U.S. cannot afford
to cede leadership on this issue." Lawmakers have also forced many tech
chief executives --- including Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple,
Sundar Pichai of Google and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta --- to testify
multiple times before Congress in recent years. In some of those
televised hearings, lawmakers of both parties have told the executives
that their companies --- with a combined \$6.4 trillion in market value
--- aren't above government or public accountability. "Some of these
companies are countries, not companies," Senator John Kennedy,
Republican of Louisiana, said in a January antitrust hearing, adding
that they are "killing fields for the truth." But so far, the talk has
not translated into new laws. The path to privacy regulations provides
the clearest case study on that record of inaction. Since 1995, Senator
Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, has introduced a dozen
privacy bills for internet service providers, drones and third-party
data brokers. In 2018, the year Europe's General Data Protection
Regulation took effect, he proposed a bill to require a consumer's
permission to share or sell data. Mr. Markey also tried twice to update
and strengthen privacy legislation for youths following his 1998 law,
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. [With every effort,
industry **[lobbying groups]{.mark}** have **[denounce]{.mark}**d the
**[bills as harmful to innovation]{.mark}**. Many Republican lawmakers
have opposed the proposals, saying they don't balance the needs of
businesses.]{.underline} "[Big Tech sees data as dollar signs, so for
decades they've bankrolled industry lobbyists to help them evade
accountability," Mr. Markey said. "**We've reached a breaking

### L -- Ban LAWS -- Congress Backlash

#### LAWs regulation invites political controversy -- drastic pushback from tech, political, and military leaders

**De Vynck 21** \[Gerrit De Vynck is a tech reporter for The Washington
Post. He writes about Google and the algorithms that increasingly shape
society, \"The U.S. says humans will always be in control of AI weapons.
But the age of autonomous war is already here," Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/07/ai-weapons-us-military/\]
GBS-HW

Drones have been a key part of warfare for years, but they've generally
been remotely controlled by humans. Now, by cobbling together readily
available image-recognition and autopilot software, autonomous drones
can be mass-produced on the cheap. **[Today, efforts to enact a total
ban on lethal autonomous weapons]{.underline}**, long demanded by human
rights activists, are now being supported by 30 countries. But the
world's leading military powers insist that isn't necessary. **[The U.S.
military says concerns are overblown, and humans can effectively control
autonomous weapons]{.underline}**, while Russia's government says true
AI weapons can't be banned because they don't exist yet. But the facts
on the ground show that technological advancements, coupled with complex
conflicts like the Syrian and Libyan civil wars, have created a reality
where weapons that make their own decisions are already killing people.
"The debate is very much still oriented towards the future," said
Ingvild Bode, an autonomous weapons researcher at the University of
Southern Denmark. "We should take a much closer look at what is already
going on." Libya wasn't the only place drones that can kill autonomously
were used last year. Turkey has used the same quadcopters to patrol its
border with Syria. When Azerbaijan invaded Armenian-occupied territory
in September, it sent in both Turkish- and Israeli-made "loitering
munitions" --- drones that can autonomously patrol an area and
automatically divebomb enemy radar signals. These weapons look like
smaller versions of the remote-controlled drones that have been used
extensively by the U.S. military in Iraq, Afghanistan and other
conflicts. Instead of launching missiles through remote control, though,
loitering munitions have a built-in explosive and destroy themselves on
impact with their target. Since they have both remote-control and
autonomous capability, it's impossible to know from the outside whether
humans made the final call to bomb individual targets. Either way, the
drones devastated Armenia's army, and the war ended two months later
with Azerbaijan gaining huge swaths of territory. **[These kinds of
weapons are moving firmly into the mainstream. Today, there are dozens
of projects by multiple governments to develop loitering munitions. Even
as countries like the United States, China and Russia participate in
discussions about a treaty limiting autonomous weapons, they're racing
ahead to develop them. "The advanced militaries are pushing the envelope
of these technologies,"]{.underline}** said Peter Asaro, a professor at
the New School in New York and a co-founder of the International
Committee for Robot Arms Control, which advocates for stricter rules
around lethal autonomous weapons. **["They will proliferate
rapidly."]{.underline}** Over the past decade, cheaper access to
computers that can crunch massive data sets in a short time has allowed
researchers to make huge breakthroughs in designing computer programs
that pull insights from large amounts of information. AI advances have
led to machines that can write poetry, accurately translate languages
and potentially help scientists develop new medicines. But debates about
the dangers of relying more on computers to make decisions are raging.
AI algorithms are only as good as the data sets they were trained on,
and studies have shown facial recognition AI programs are better at
identifying White faces than Black and Brown ones. European lawmakers
recently proposed strict new rules regulating the use of AI. Companies
including Google, Amazon, Apple and Tesla have poured billions of
dollars into developing the technology, and critics say AI programs are
sometimes being deployed without full knowledge of how they work and
what the consequences of widespread use could be. **[Some countries,
such as Austria, have joined the call for a global ban on autonomous
weapons, but U.S. tech and political leaders are pushing
back.]{.underline}** In March, a panel of tech luminaries including
former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, then-chief of Web services,
now chief executive of Amazon Andy Jassy and Microsoft chief scientist
Eric Horvitz released a study on the impact of AI on national security.
The 756-page final report, commissioned by Congress, argued that
Washington should oppose a ban on autonomous weapons because it would be
difficult to enforce, and could stop the United States from using
weapons it already has in its arsenal. In a first, Air Force uses AI on
military jet **["It may be impossible to define the category of systems
to be restricted in such a way that provides adequate clarity while not
overly constraining existing U.S. military capabilities," the report
said.]{.underline}**

**[The US has rejected calls for a binding agreement regulating or
banning the use of "killer robots"]{.underline}**, instead proposing a
"code of conduct" at the United Nations. Speaking at a meeting in Geneva
focused on finding common ground on the use of such so-called lethal
autonomous weapons, a **[US official balked at the idea of regulating

meeting saw government experts preparing for high-level talks at a
review conference on the Convention of Certain Conventional Weapons from
13 to 17 December. "In our view, the best way to make progress \...
would be through the development of a non-binding code of conduct," US
official Josh Dorosin told the meeting. The United Nations has been
hosting diplomatic talks in Geneva since 2017 aimed at reaching an
agreement on how to address the use of killer robots. **[Activists and a
number of countries have called for an all-out ban on any weapons that
could use lethal force without a human overseeing the process and making
the final kill order.]{.underline}** In November 2018, the UN chief,
António Guterres, joined the call for a ban, but so far countries do not
even agree on whether there is a need to regulate the weapons. **[During
Thursday's debate, a number of countries, including India and the United
States, criticised the idea of a legally binding
agreement.]{.underline}** Dorosin insisted a code of conduct "would help
states promote responsible behaviour and compliance with international
law".Campaigners disagreed.

### L -- Ban LAWS -- DOD backlash

#### Military leaders are in favor of LAWS -- DoD will oppose the plan

on Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems," Congressional Research Service
Reports, 11-17-21,
https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11150) //sg

Lethal autonomous weapon systems ([LAWS]{.underline}) are a special
class of weapon systems that use sensor suites and computer algorithms
to independently identify a target and employ an onboard weapon system
to engage and destroy the target without manual human control of the
system. [Although these systems are not yet in widespread development,
it is **believed they would enable military operations** in
communications-degraded or -denied environments in which traditional
systems may not be able to operate.]{.underline} Contrary to a number of
news reports, [U.S. policy **does not prohibit the development or
employment** of LAWS.]{.underline} Although the United States does not
currently have LAWS in its inventory, some [**senior military and
defense leaders** have stated that the United States may be compelled to
develop LAWS in the future if U.S. competitors choose to do
so.]{.underline} At the same time, a growing number of states and
nongovernmental organizations are appealing to the international
community for regulation of or a ban on LAWS due to ethical concerns.

the public and activist groups has led a growing number of states ---
including U.S. allies like Pakistan and Jordan --- to call for bans on
the use of lethal autonomous weapon systems.61

Second, **[civilian engineers and researchers that develop AI technology

the employees argued that "Google should not be in the business of war,"
explaining that the company should not "outsource the moral
responsibility of \[its\] technologies to third parties," and that work
on Defense Department-backed AI would "irreparably damage Google's

based on data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics. Since the

influence over the government by analyzing the tech companies' lobbying
spending and campaign contributions. Here are the key findings of this
report: **[[Facebook and Amazon are]{.mark} now the [two biggest

**[[Big Tech has eclipsed]{.underline}]{.mark}** yesterday's big
lobbying spenders, **[[Big Oil and Big Tobacco]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
In 2020, Amazon and Facebook spent nearly twice as much as Exxon and
Philip Morris on lobbying. During the 2020 election cycle, Big Tech
spent \$124 million in lobbying and campaign contributions ---- breaking
its own records from past election cycles. Amazon and Facebook drove
most of this growth. From the years of 2018-2020, Amazon increased
spending by 30% while Facebook added an astounding 56% to its Washington
investment. The four Big Tech companies recruited more lobbyists into
their army, increasing its ranks by 40 new lobbyists, from 293 in 2018
to 333 in 2020.\[10\] Big Tech PACs, lobbyists, and employees
contributed over 33% more in the 2020 election cycle than they did in
the 2018 cycle, for an increase of over \$4 million in funds, and a
total of nearly \$16.5 million in contributions to the election cycle.
This marks the greatest cycle-over-cycle increase in campaign
contributions from Big Tech in the ten-year span Public Citizen
reviewed. **[[Big Tech's lobbyists are not just numerous, they are
also]{.mark} among the [most influential]{.mark} in
Washington]{.underline}**. Among the 10 lobbyists who were the biggest
contributors to the 2020 election cycle, half lobby on behalf of at
least one of the four Big Tech companies. Together, just these five
lobbyists contributed over \$2 million to the 2020 elections. Nearly all

Much has already been achieved in terms of new structures, new
initiatives and new policy developments to support the collaborative
adoption of AI among NATO Allies and EU member states. In addition to
pre-existing structures and mechanisms at both the NATO and EU levels,
which have ensured that nations are not starting from scratch, national
defence institutions are already able to refer to common policy
commitments and to options, whether through NATO or the EDA, for
research or capability-development activ-ities. At the same time,
**[[ensuring a competitive edge in AI is a]{.mark} truly
[whole-of-government effort which]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[requires

and relevance in AI in general, and its defence applications in
particular, it seems desirable to focus on two strategic priorities:
investment volumes, both public and pri- vate, which need to be
significantly increased; and the full use of collaborative mecha- nisms

### L -- Biotech Investment

#### Biotech investment draws political controversy -- picking favorites perceived as undermine public efforts and a corporate handout

**Servick 19** \[Kelly Servick is a staff writer at Science,
\"Controversial U.S. bill would lift Supreme Court ban on patenting
human genes\", Science,
https://www.science.org/content/article/controversial-us-bill-would-lift-supreme-court-ban-patenting-human-genes\]
GBS-HW

**[A congressional proposal that would overturn a landmark U.S. Supreme
Court decision that barred the patenting of human genes and ease other
restrictions on patenting software and biomedical inventions is drawing
fierce criticism from some scientific societies and patient
advocates.]{.underline}** Yesterday, the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) in Washington, D.C., along with more than 100 other signatories
from research institutes and advocacy groups, released a letter to
lawmakers arguing the changes would stifle medical research and hinder
patients\' access to diagnostic tests.

**[The draft bill \"would result in a quagmire of patent claims and
legal impediments to the normal scientific exchange,\" said Harold
Varmus, a cancer biologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City
and former director of the National Cancer Institute, in a press
conference yesterday. \"It\'s in the interest of virtually everyone to
keep ideas and basic discoveries about the laws and products of nature
in the public domain.\"]{.underline}**

The ACLU letter comes as the Senate Committee on the Judiciary kicks off
the first in a series of three hearings that will examine potential
changes to U.S. patent law. Today\'s hearing is expected to include
discussion of the draft proposal, released last month by a bipartisan
group of lawmakers, which would overturn current restrictions on
patenting products and processes that occur in nature, including human
genes.

**[The bill aims to address a complaint that has been brewing for years
in the biotechnology and software industries: that recent Supreme Court
decisions have created confusing and overly stringent patent eligibility
rules.]{.underline}** In particular, critics point to three recent
rulings:

The 2012 decision in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus
Laboratories invalidated a patent on adjusting drug dosage based on
levels of metabolites in a patient\'s blood because it relied on a \"law
of nature.\"

The landmark 2013 ruling in Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) v.
Myriad Genetics Inc. said that human genes can\'t be patented because
they are a \"product of nature.\"

In 2014, software patents took a blow from the Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank
International decision, which found a financial trading program to be an
unpatentable \"abstract idea.\"

The new bill \"makes it clear in no uncertain terms that all the Supreme
Court \[decisions\] are just gone,\" says Arti Rai, a patent law expert
at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. It says decisions about
patent eligibility should not rely on \"judicially created exceptions
... including 'abstract ideas,\' 'laws of nature,\' or 'natural
phenomena.\'\"

The bill\'s sponsors in the Senate, Thom Tillis (R--NC) and Chris Coons
(D--DE), have described it as a way to restore incentives for U.S.
innovation by making the process for protecting new inventions more
predictable. (Competition with China, where no comparable restrictions
exist in the patent system, may have motivated the lawmakers, Rai says.)

**[But opponents say the bill would enable monopolies on discoveries
that should be widely available for research and medical
use.]{.underline}** In the 2013 Myriad case, the diagnostic company
Myriad Genetics of Salt Lake City claimed that its broad patents on two
human genes gave it exclusive rights to clinical tests for
cancer-associated mutations in those genes. In striking down the
patents, the Supreme Court allowed other diagnostic companies to offer
such tests without fear of infringement lawsuits. **[Signatories on the
new letter---including plaintiffs who challenged the Myriad patents, and
ACLU, which represented them---argue that if the proposed law is
enacted, \"We will again see high prices for tests with no competition
in the market.\"]{.underline}**

The San Francisco Business Times reported that **[industry lobbyists
are [urging Congress to approve a
plan](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2022/06/14/net-operating-losses-nol-tax-credit-biotech.html)]{.underline}** that
will **[allow companies]{.underline}** that are not yet generating
revenue from the sales of their assets **[to be allowed to sell net
operating loss]{.underline}** carryforwards to larger companies. In
other words, the biotech companies are looking to sell their losses to
larger companies to provide them with a tax credit that would allow them
to lower their tax burden.   Currently, net operating loss (NOL)
carryforwards allow businesses that have suffered financial losses
within a fiscal year to deduct them from profits in future years. This
will enable businesses to be taxed on average profitability. The **[plan
floated by biotech leaders]{.underline}** would certainly be appealing
to some of the larger companies. As the Business Times explained, NOL
carryforwards are attractive to merger and acquisition specialists
because of their practical applications in decreasing tax burdens. But,
those are NOLs that are gained through an acquisition. The current plan
seeks to give small companies the ability to sell those losses on the
open market without going through the M&A process.  If a company gains a
commercial revenue stream, it can take up to a decade and hundreds of
millions of dollars in revenue that can offset those net operating
losses.  While the sale of NOLs is not an option across the country as a
whole, there are places where the practice is already in place. For
years, the state of New Jersey has allowed tech and life sciences
companies to sell up to \$20 million in state net operating losses or
R&D tax credits to buyers, which the purchasers can use to reduce
taxable income. California has also reinstated the sale of NOLs as the
state faced a budget deficit of \$34 billion. It appears to have been
successful as the state is now projected to have a surplus. **[But, at
the federal level, the idea of NOL sales has not seen much
movement]{.underline}**.  This plan would allow early-stage companies
with a new source of capital, mainly if they have been unsuccessful at
finding significant funding from venture capitalists.
The Business Times report comes the same day that Third Rock Ventures
announced a new \$1.1 billion fund aimed at supporting startup
companies. The approach would provide a new source of funding for these
early-stage companies. The supporters of the plan also noted that larger
companies would benefit through a new tax-reduction tool. 
The Business Times speculated that these NOLs are worth hundreds of
millions of dollars. If the carryforward sale is allowed, the **[biotech

Obamacare\'s failed incentive structure (strike three). Unsurprisingly,
the aforementioned rationale didn\'t resonate with middle-class voters.

these most critical entities, nor is it consistent with what the
solarium Commission proposed," Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., chair of the
House Homeland Security Committee's panel on cybersecurity,
infrastructure protection and innovation, said during a hearing
Wednesday. "We need to be able to answer the question, 'what do these
companies need to do as a result of their designation?' And 'what does
the federal government need to do for them?'"  The [Katko

composed of members of Congress from across the political spectrum,
executive-branch officials and major private-sector representatives,
proposed that entities designated systemically important critical

This does not mean that states that face hostile hybrid activities below
the threshold of armed conflict will be left alone. **[Intelligence
cooperation between allied countries does exist, and threat information
is occasionally shared]{.underline}**. In addition to the current
political collaboration facilitated by NATO to improve network security
and resilience, the EU is engaging in similar civilian activities, as
well as developing and implementing a cyber-diplomatic toolbox to create
a common basis for responding to a variety of malicious activities
against member states. Further strengthening the political partnership
between the EU and NATO is thus the most appropriate way forward to
avoid further militarization of cyberspace. **[[Sustaining]{.mark} the
[intell]{.mark}igence [norm]{.mark} as the dominant norm [is not without
potential problems]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Openly embracing the fact
that cyberspace is a domain in which intelligence agencies are
constrained only by domestic laws, and where takedowns of servers in
foreign countries are not necessarily perceived as serious breaches of
sovereignty, is likely to lead to an increase in the exploitation of IT
vulnerabilities in commercial software used in both enemy and allied
networks. For smaller states, this could increase the risk of
retaliation by larger adversaries, and it could increase the risk of
divisions between allies---divisions that are not aligned with the
United States' political ambition to use cyber coordination in NATO as
part of its attempt to 'defend forward'.74 More exploitation could also
ultimately make cyberspace less free, less open and less secure,
rendering civilian populations more susceptible to cybercrime,
surveillance and disruptions of everyday services.75 This is why **[some

Attribution difficulties present further challenges to the 'who' of
deterrence. Adversaries with rapidly changing tactics, techniques, and
procedures---along with the ability to easily conceal an operation's
origin and perpetrator---can pose hurdles to technical attribution.41
Technical difficulties can weaken deterrent postures by delaying the
timeliness of retaliatory punishment. Moreover, the effects of an
operation that a defender notices may actually be second- or third-order
effects. This can add additional time between attribution and
punishment.42 **[The larger attribution issues]{.underline}**, however,
**[are political]{.underline}**. NATO lacks common standards or guidance
for attributing cyber operations in either a technical or political
sense. Indeed, **[attribution remains a member state
prerogative]{.underline}**. Not only are the targeted member states
responsible for attribution, but those members looking to contribute to
collective defense must perform independent attribution assessments, and
**[the political decision for a collective defense response must come
from the NAC]{.underline}**.43 **[[Reaching]{.mark} a [consensus]{.mark}
decision to trigger collective defense in response to cyberspace
operations [is likely to be politically contentious]{.mark}, and [member
states will have few incentives to risk revealing the intelligence
sources and methods that underlie attribution
decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These dynamics are likely to intensify
when additional links in the attribution chain are required, such as
when a perpetrator is encouraged or sponsored by an adversarial state
but lacks direct ties. Attribution is less likely to be politically
controversial across the Alliance once a conventional conflict is
underway as contextual clues from kinetic attacks can reduce
uncertainty. This discussion points to a greater role for
deterrence-by-denial. Deterring an adversary by taking measures to deny
potential gains does not hinge on attribution and thus possesses a
potentially wider scope of application.44 A second and related hurdle
for cyber deterrence is determining which actions the Alliance seeks to
deter. Much of the activity in cyberspace falls below the physical
effects thresholds associated with the disruption, degradation, or
destruction of computers and networks. Such considerations complicate
decisions to invoke Article 5---specifically, the types of cyberattacks
to which Article 5 should apply. Indeed, cyber operations targeting
military assets or critical civilian infrastructure can be incredibly
costly but may not reach damage levels associated with conventional
attacks.45 Moreover, espionage via network exploitation is widespread,
varied, and falls well below the threshold of armed conflict.46
Problematically, such exploitation can be nearly indistinguishable from
operations that eventually seek to attack computers or networks and
produce effects. Network exploitation can even be precursor to
conventional military operations.47 Determining how to deter presents a
third obstacle to NATO's cyber deterrence efforts. Threatening
conventional military means in response to cyber operations poses
dilemmas of proportionality and can risk unintended escalation.48
**[[Retaliation]{.mark} with cyber [tools carry their own
problems]{.mark}]{.underline}**. First, **[the Alliance faces issues of
political reliability, particularly in the context of the SCEPVA
framework. Legally, [Allies retain different constitutional restraints
on o]{.mark}ffensive [c]{.mark}yber [o]{.mark}peration[s]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} can [hamper the ability to volunteer sovereign
effects]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Strategically, **[[states may be
hesitant to volunteer their 'best' cyber effects for fear of burning an
exploit that could have had a greater payoff when used in a national
context]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Volunteering sovereign effects can
also inadvertently give unwanted insight to an adversary regarding an
Ally's techniques, tactics, and procedures. Second, the temporary and
transient nature of cyber capabilities makes it incredibly difficult to
establish repeatable and predictable effects required of deterrent
threats.]{.underline}**49 Finally, signaling in cyberspace is generally
ambiguous and rarely straightforward.50 For instance, an adversary may
not even recognize a signal, believing it instead to be a technical
glitch. Even if a costly signal is received, there is no way to ensure
that it has interpreted as intended. In addition to deterrence, NATO's
fail-safe cyber defense efforts face political and technical challenges.
Because NATO will not undertake any active defense measures, actions to
mitigate the effects of a cyberattack are limited to NATO networks or to
individual member state networks when requested. This forecloses the
possibility of developing an institutional strategy to mitigate the
costs of a cyberattack upstream by disrupting the source of an attack,
much like US Cyber Command does with its "defend forward" posture.51
More problematically, **[[Allies have and will continue to have
different legal, strategic, doctrinal, and threat frameworks for
cyberspace]{.mark} that complicate defensive measures for the
Alliance.]{.underline}** Most immediately this means that Allies will
locate resources to different aspects of cyber defense based on
individual country circumstances. **[Different strategic focuses have
the potential to intensify disparate threat perceptions, capabilities,
and skillsets]{.underline}**. This can also exacerbate interoperability
problems; for example, during an operation or crisis, some systems will
be controlled by NATO while others will be controlled by an ally or a
group of allies with different skill and knowledge levels. In the longer
term, disparate legal understandings, particularly regarding sovereignty
in cyberspace, will become more impactful as a greater number of allied
nations develop forward defense strategies and the requisite
capabilities for out-of-network operations. **[[An out-of-network
operation can in and of itself cause operational
friction]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, **[[differing definitions of
sovereignty in cyberspace]{.mark}---and what violates it---[inevitably
create political friction]{.mark} between Allies as some look to operate
and produce effects on other Allies' networks]{.underline}**.52 **[[This
political friction will contribute to even greater hesitancy over
cyber-intelligence sharing and complicate the
coordination]{.underline}]{.mark}** of defensive mitigation measures
across the Alliance.

Cyber Attribution Debates Tear Apart the NATO Alliance,"
https://www.lawfareblog.com/dont-let-cyber-attribution-debates-tear-apart-nato-alliance\]

The United States still struggles to find effective policies for
deterring cyberattacks. Suggestions run the gamut from more widespread
use of indictments and economic sanctions, despite their lackluster
record of success, to less traditional but more risky policies that
emphasize the asymmetric advantage America has in conventional military
power. Most of the discussion of cyber deterrence focuses on preventing
a single catastrophic or cascading cyberattack that would threaten lives
(like disruptions to electricity transmission or clean water)---or our
way of life---altering election outcomes or grinding global finance to a
halt. Yet the reality is that in the event of such an attack, the
response would likely not come from the U.S. alone but from the NATO
alliance in concert. [**[NATO's cyber-defense mandate has
evolved]{.mark}** over time **to update its collective defense
commitment**]{.underline} under Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty
[for the era of cyberattacks.]{.underline} In the latest effort to
collectively impose costs on adversaries, [the 2018 NATO Summit saw a
commitment from heads of state and government "[to integrate]{.mark}
sovereign [cyber effects, provided voluntarily by Allies]{.mark}, into
Alliance operations and missions, [in the framework of strong political
oversight]{.mark}]{.underline}." The newly updated White House National
Cyber Strategy likewise envisions working together with a "coalition of
like-minded states" to "ensure adversaries understand the consequences
of their malicious cyber behavior." [**[Therein lies the rub.]{.mark}
Both formal [alliances, such as NATO]{.mark}, and more ad hoc
arrangements, such as what the Cyber Deterrence Initiative imagines,
[will]{.mark}** [require members to share intelligence]{.mark} and
eventually, to the best of their ability and perhaps in different
domains, contribute to joint action against a presumably well-armed
foreign aggressor]{.underline}. [States]{.underline} including the
United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Estonia, and Denmark
[have publicly declared their willingness to lend sovereign offensive
cyber effects to deter, defend against and counter the full spectrum of
threats.]{.underline} [Sharing intelligence and information is a key
element of NATO's core decision-making process enshrined in Article
4]{.underline} of the Washington Treaty. **[[Political consultations are
part of the preventive diplomacy between member states]{.mark}, but they
are also an avenue to discuss concerns related to the security threats
member states face.]{.underline}** These consultations can be a catalyst
for reaching a consensus on policies to be adopted or actions to be
taken---including those on the use of sovereign cyber effects to support
a NATO operation. The alliance has a track record of collective action
and cooperative security measures. For example, Operation Active
Endeavour helped to deter, disrupt and protect against terrorist
activity in the Mediterranean in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist
attacks, in solidarity with the United States. For the seventh time, the
Atlantic Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative will be among the
organizations privileged to organize an event on the sidelines of the
Feb. 15--17 Munich Security Conference. This year in particular, the
Atlantic Council's event, "Defending Human Dignity: Limiting Malicious
Cyber Activity Through Diplomacy," will complement the topics high on
the agenda of the main conference, such as transatlantic collaboration,
the consequences of a resurgence of great power competition and the
future of arms control. In the United States, the greatest failures of
response and deterrence to foreign aggression in cyberspace have not
been caused by a lack of intelligence, capability or imagination.
Rather, [[U.S. policy has been]{.underline}]{.mark} serviceable in
theory but [[impotent in practice because of]{.mark} an [inability to
translate]{.mark} technical findings and [intelligence into public
support for]{.mark} sufficiently tough responses ordered by elected
[political leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}. [North Korea's repeated
operations targeting U.S. companies and critical infrastructure have
been met with [public skepticism]{.mark} [over]{.mark} their
[culpability, limit]{.mark}ing [the strength of]{.mark} retaliatory
[options needed to deter]{.mark} further events. Chinese cyber economic
espionage continued for years despite widespread knowledge of China's
activities because [political leaders found it difficult to confront
Beijing without undermining U.S. companies]{.mark} in return. Russian
information operations did not sow enough doubt to mislead experts, but
they succeeded in [exacerbating the partisan polarization of an
already-divided electorate and its leaders. That inability to translate
the findings of cyber experts into public]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[sentiment and therefore political action has sidelined America's
cyberwarriors]{.underline}]{.mark}, by far the most technologically
advanced and well-resourced in the world. Imagine the political response
of an ally that is asked to burden-share in response to cyber aggression
but is probably much closer to any resulting kinetic fight than the
United States. Now imagine the response of that ally when it's being
asked to take causus belli on faith: The United States is presenting
attribution for a cyberattack elsewhere in the world, but perhaps is
depending on the ally lacking critical details due to classification,
and is presenting that information alongside a request for help that
might well put the ally in the crosshairs of its own cyberattack or
lethal action. How can allies with different capabilities to collect,
analyze and understand intelligence be part of a consensus on using
sovereign cyber effects to support a NATO operation? How can a commander
achieve a common operational picture to authorize the use of sovereign
effects in a NATO operation if all the allies are not on the same page
with respect to critical attribution and other technical information
needed for a use of effect in an operation? We all know what a tank
looks like on a shared satellite image, but if you ask three cyber
experts to interpret the attribution for a set of indicators, you are
likely to get at least four answers. For most U.S. allies in Europe and
elsewhere, there is simply a dearth of technical know-how within the
government when it comes to cyber attribution and operations. This is
already a challenge for the United States, with a massive defense
budget, Silicon Valley innovation and an educated workforce to pull into
government service. But for many U.S. allies, tech-savvy public servants
will have long fled for the private sector, nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) and academia before reaching ministerial positions.
To its credit, the U.S. National Cyber Strategy does propose
capacity-building measures to support allies. This means building up law
enforcement, intelligence, and military operational and investigative
capability. But even with successful capacity-building programs, many
nations could, in a crisis, end up in the same place the United States
is---with good options stuck on the shelf while political leaders and
their electorates lack a critical mass of informed voters to trust,
understand and act on expert findings. For countries weighing whether to
risk their own blood and treasure in support of an ally's cyber
attribution findings, this hurdle could well prove insurmountable if not
addressed well before a crisis emerges. Many such countries will no
doubt recall being burned when placing too much confidence in U.S.
technical and human sources without an ability to evaluate the evidence
for themselves, as with the Iraq weapons of mass destruction findings.
The private sector will probably play a crucial role in providing
intelligence to support alliance responses to cyberattacks, especially
as a stopgap over the next few years. FireEye and its peer competitors
and partners regularly produce analyses of major world cyber
events---many that fly below the radar of Western leadership, in
fact---sometimes at a near-government quality and often covering much of
the same "classified" evidence. More important, private-sector analysts
are accustomed to writing for impact with both their technical
counterparts, like chief information security officers (CISOs) and
threat hunters, and nontechnical stakeholders such as boards of
directors, CEOs and other persons controlling the purse strings. In this
sense, unclassified, private-sector and NGO-driven cyber threat
intelligence can become the lingua franca of discussions. Relying on
commercial reporting generated by international teams, rather than
declassified government-generated reports, both broadens the audience
enough to make alliance discussions feasible and mitigates against
disparities in terminology across national lines---the tendency of even
closely integrated allies to describe cyber "attack," "information
operations," and attribution findings with different implicit
assumptions or implications. Long-Term Thinking In the long run, though,
**[[the U.S.]{.mark} and its more technologically advanced
allies]{.underline}**---such as its fellow Five Eyes (Australia, Canada,
New Zealand and the U.K.), France and Japan---**[[will have to make
important policy changes in the interests of furthering alliance
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in cyberspace: [a willingness
to]{.mark} sometimes [risk sensitive sources]{.mark} and methods in
order to get cyber threat intelligence into the hands of other countries
better positioned to take policy action, [an end to classifying
public]{.mark} [info]{.mark}rmation like IP addresses solely because of
their acquisition via classified means, and greater transparency on
their own decision-making.]{.underline} Government cyber leaders within
the alliance should consider taking another page out of the
private-sector playbook as well: running cyber-crisis exercises that
involve more than the IT department. In the commercial world, the more
successful practice runs involve leaders at both the CISO level and some
presence from nontechnical teams that would weigh in during a crisis,
such as communications and legal. The best exercises involve executives,
too, who despite their busy schedules must see for themselves how their
companies would survive and respond during a potentially ruinous
cyberattack, and work through the minutiae of leading a response
themselves. The experience and confidence is invaluable if ever called
on during a real-life crisis, and the organizational introspection by
involving decision-makers at all levels is irreplaceable.
Military-to-military cyber training as part of cross-country force
standardization and joint operational planning could pull in more senior
national leadership, beyond battlefield commanders, and be coupled with
increased funding for foreign affairs-led training for nontechnical
leaders. The private sector could also meaningfully contribute during
NATO consultations when developing Allied Joint Publications to make
sure that definitions and requirements for threat intelligence
incorporate the best practices of NATO member countries' private
sectors. If a U.S. diplomat reaches out to his or her counterpart in an
allied country to ask for assistance responding to malware that's
damaging critical infrastructure, and that counterpart has to ask what
malware is, the response isn't going to happen. \*\*\* NATO's essential
and enduring purpose is to safeguard the freedom and security of all its
members by political and military means. Tolerating cyberattacks,
especially those deliberately targeting civilians and the political
legitimacy of governments---without the alliance having the capability
to jointly discuss attribution and have the confidence to act and assist
one another---undermines this core purpose of the alliance. Likewise,
pursuing only deterrence and response without an active role for the
alliance in reaching peaceful diplomatic agreements with potential
adversaries abrogates member responsibilities to their citizens but is
impossible without a common language and operational picture to discuss
enforcement of such agreements. The U.S. is stronger with allies, and
with attention to these issues its cybersecurity can be too.

the federal response to cyber threats.]{.underline} The issue took
center stage this week, as senators on the Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs Committee fretted that they had been unable to pass
key cyber legislation requested by the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) because of a disagreement with the Senate Intelligence Committee.
{mosads}"The reality of the situation is there is conflict here," said
Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) at a hearing Wednesday. "This threat is
too significant to allow turf wars to get in the way of as efficient an
operation as possible in terms of dealing with a very complex and
serious problem." The dust-up illuminates the broader issue of turf wars
over cybersecurity in the federal government. [**[The executive branch

**[authorities are spread out over various
agencies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including the Justice Department, which
investigates and prosecutes cyber crime, and the [Pentagon and broader
intelligence community]{.underline}, both of which [handle]{.underline}
what is considered ["offensive" cyber activity]{.underline}. While

//sg

From a legal perspective, the issue this highlights is that operations
abroad implicate the UN Charter and related claims about international
law protection of sovereignty. So how does this become part of the Title
10/Title 50 debate? [Intelligence agencies can more easily
act]{.underline} in this setting when operating [under Title 50
authority, as **covert action** status carries with it a statutory
obligation to comply with the U.S. Constitution and U.S. statutes---but
**no more than that**. Title 10, in contrast, **carries with it no such
implicit statutory shield against international law objections,** and of
course there is a general Defense Department policy of international law
compliance. Thus **CYBERCOM operating under Title 10 would run into the
full thicket of international law concerns**.]{.underline} There may be
good and sufficient answers to those concerns in particular cases---so
this should not be understood as an absolute bar---but it does make
sense to say that the [legal friction is greater in that
setting]{.underline} (that is, operations with effects on servers in
third countries and without consent from those countries) [than it would
be for an entity acting under color of Title 50.]{.underline}

People across the US have gathered to protest\[3\] against anti-Asian
hate crimes, following the Atlanta spa shootings on 16 March and an
assault on a 75-year-old Asian American woman the following day.
Racially motivated hate crimes have been more common since the outbreak
of Covid-19. The US Asian community has been increasingly targeted\[4\]
over the past year, in part as a consequence of President Donald
Trump\'s framing of the pandemic as the \'China virus\'\[5\]. The recent
attacks and ongoing harassment of Asian Americans have once again
highlighted the handling of racial discrimination in America and renewed
awareness\[6\] of race-based conflict. Information operations A
report\[7\] declassified by the US National Intelligence Council has
assessed foreign threats to last year\'s election. The report identifies
several nations that considered or attempted **[online influence

intelligence operatives\' use of US media organisations and people
linked to the Trump administration to promote damaging narratives about
presidential candidate Joe Biden and his family to US officials. Writing
for The Atlantic\[8\], Anne Applebaum notes that the report highlights
broader issues beyond the political climate created by Trump. It shows
that Russian **[disinformation succeeds because of the willingness of

parliament\'s Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee has

protect ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. This action comes after an ASPI
report\[10\] on Uyghur forced labour in supply chains used by companies
in the technology, fashion, media and cotton industries. The committee
asked\[11\] a number of corporations to clarify their relationships with
forced-labour supply chains in Xinjiang. Most companies claimed to have
strong protections on human rights but failed to prove that their supply
chains weren\'t involved in forced labour. Nike and H&#38;M, for
example, said that, while they couldn\'t identify connections to forced
labour, they would strive to improve their practices. The committee also
recommended\[12\] that the government put the onus on companies to prove
that they have no ties to forced labour. And despite global attention on
human rights violations in Xinjiang---which China denies---real progress
to end forced labour has yet to be seen. Terror byte Last week, ASIO
Director-General Mike Burgess announced that his agency will use

ASIO will now classify threats as \'ideologically motivated\' or
\'religiously motivated\' violent extremism. In delivering his annual
threat assessment, Burgess said \'language needs to evolve\' to include
extremist groups that recruit members online and do not typically fit
within the parameters of the previous terms. Some have welcomed the
change\[14\] in the hope that it will decrease prejudicial language
directed at Muslim communities. Others have described the decision as
part of a continued political effort\[15\] to avoid using terms like
\'right-wing\' or \'far-right\' to describe the groups that now account

U.S. Rep. [Kay

she **[criticized Democratic leadership]{.underline}** for rushing the

that now unfortunately permeates most of Western Europe." Roy didn't
elaborate on how he thought the center would be used in such a way. He
said in his statement that "it is imperative for the United States to
stand side by side with our NATO allies" rather than "passing toothless
resolutions." "**[NATO should be focused on military

### L -- GOP Backlash

#### Can't build [consensus]{.underline}\-\--right-wing politicans are in on it!

Peter **Stone**, 4-6-**2022**, Investigative journalist at the Guardian
\"US rightwing figures in step with Kremlin over Ukraine disinformation,
experts say,\" Guardian,
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/06/us-right-wing-republicans-russia-ukraine-disinformation//DG

**[Disinformation specialists say that the phoney narratives by the US
right]{.underline}** and the Kremlin during the war have displayed some
new twists that have **[increased the flow of conspiracy-heavy
news]{.underline}**, but also spurred more criticism from experts for
being patently false. "We often see a two-way flow of **[conspiratorial
narratives moving from the rightwing American information ecosystem to
the Kremlin]{.underline}** and back again, in a way that **[creates a
feedback loop that reinforces and bolsters messaging]{.underline}** from
both groups," said Bret Schafer, who leads the Alliance for Securing
Democracy's information manipulation team. We often see a flow of
narratives from the rightwing US information ecosystem to the Kremlin
and back Schafer noted the feedback loop seems "best evidenced by the
**[recent effort to connect Hunter Biden to a US-led bioweapons
program]{.underline}** in Ukraine, where one can clearly see the merging
of a **[favored domestic narrative into a foreign disinformation
campaign]{.underline}** that makes it feel more familiar, and therefore
more plausible, to certain target audiences". Schafer added that
"influential American pundits and conspiracy theorists first pushed the
narrative, only to then have it amplified and legitimized at the highest
levels of the Russian government". Some members of **[Congress likewise
see a crossover effect between elements of the American right and
Moscow]{.underline}**. "Putin and his oligarchs are well aware of the
dark channels of influence in rightwing American politics today, and
they exploit them whenever they can -- just as corporations and
rightwing billionaires do here at home," the Democratic senator Sheldon
Whitehouse told the Guardian.

## Humanitarian Assistance

### L -- Aid Unpopular

**[While fiscal 2022 defense spending saw an increase]{.underline}** of
5.6 percent over last year's levels, the **[nondefense spending accounts
got a boost]{.underline}** of 6.7 percent --- but **[not the foreign aid
portfolio]{.underline}**. **[Multiple lawmakers have pointed to the over
\$4 billion in]{.underline}** emergency **[humanitarian funding for the
Ukraine crisis to argue Congress has provided ample taxpayer assistance
this year for foreign aid]{.underline}**. Still, budget experts do not
believe the Russia-Ukraine war, which has dominated Capitol Hill's
attention in recent weeks, is the reason other humanitarian disasters
did not see a funding injection. For one thing, Appropriations
**[subcommittee spending levels]{.underline}**, known as 302(b)s,
**[were set in early February]{.underline}**, weeks before Putin ordered
the invasion of Ukraine. Even as **[appropriators like Coons have
pledged to push for higher foreign aid spending]{.underline}** levels in
fiscal 2023, **[advocates are nervous about those
prospect]{.underline}**s. Considering that Democrats might lose unified
control of the White House and Congress after the November midterm
elections, the **[fiscal 2022 appropriations levels were viewed as the
high-water mark for Democrats to lock in robust spending
increases]{.underline}**. That would help cushion the blow of
**[probable GOP pushes for cuts to foreign aid, which remains
unpopular]{.underline}** with an outspoken minority of Republican
**[fiscal hardliners]{.underline}**. Any supplemental aid for Ukraine,
and possibly for the global coronavirus pandemic, will likely have a
fleeting impact on the overall budget, experts say. "At the end of the
day, we all know that an emergency supplemental is exactly what it says
it is. It is an emergency supplemental that is not part of the regular
budget and so there is an artificially low baseline for humanitarian
assistance moving forward, just looking at the numbers, and that is
**[concerning for conversations around what is needed for the coming
fiscal year]{.underline}**," said one foreign aid professional, who did
not have authorization to speak candidly about the budget.

allies and partners, including South Korea and Japan, but
**[particularly in Europe]{.underline}**. Early on, Biden reassured
European allies of Washington's commitment to their security, promising
them, "America is back. The trans-Atlantic alliance is back." Despite
some missteps along the way, the **[political capital Biden invested in

### L -- Domestic Focus k/

#### The plan ruins Biden's domestic focus\-\--appeal to crucial portions of the electorate is contingent on perception of refocusing away from Europe

correspondant \"Biden's been consumed by Ukraine. His team wants to
bring the focus back home.,\" POLITICO,
https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/18/biden-domestic-policy-shift-00025862//DG

The rest of the world might not allow it. But Joe **[Biden wants to
return his focus to matters happening at home]{.underline}**. With the
war in **[Ukraine entering its second month and continuing to dominate
global headline]{.underline}**s, White House **[allies are expressing
concern that voters may see the president as more consumed by
international affairs than domestic ones.]{.underline}** The White House
itself is keenly aware that voters' perceptions about the economy are
still likely to determine the outcome of November's midterm elections.
And as they warily watch the president's poor poll numbers, two senior
administration officials said a **[concerted effort is being launched to
reemphasize to Americans that the president understands their pain and
is trying to help]{.underline}**. In the coming weeks, Biden will travel
more inside the country and further stress that Russia's invasion isn't
some far-off crisis but one with deep economic ramifications in the
United States "**[Voters, as sympathetic as they are to Ukraine, are
getting a little fatigued]{.underline}**," said Celinda Lake, a veteran
Democratic pollster. "And they're wondering: **[We're spending all this
money abroad, but what are we spending here at home?"]{.underline}**
Lake said it was **[imperative that the president spend the seven months
remaining before the midterms explaining his record and promising to do
more.]{.underline}** "Half of voters," she suggested, still don't know
what Biden has accomplished to date. "They don't know what's in the
infrastructure package. They don't know the full extent of the rescue
package. They don't know the executive orders that he's taken on
inflation," she said, referring to the coronavirus stimulus money sent
to states, and the \$1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law to rebuild
roads, bridges and more. The scope of Biden's presidency will be
impacted by Democrats' ability to keep control of at least one, if not
both, chambers of Congress this November. And the White House knows it
needs to both hammer home Biden's accomplishments and show Americans it
is trying to do more, even at the margins. The **[war in Europe will
continue to dominate Biden's time, but aides do not want it to occupy
all of his attention]{.underline}**. In fact, some of Biden's advisers
believe they only need to look across the Atlantic to find a **[warning
sign of a president perceived to be focused too much on global diplomacy
and not enough on domestic pocketbook issue]{.underline}**s. Many French
voters believe that French President Emmanuel Macron prioritized trying
to negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin and that he neglected
domestic issues, leading to tight poll numbers heading into the
presidential runoff election later this month. As it **[looks to refocus
on domestic issues, the White House is eyeing faster, tangible actions
to tackle kitchen table issues, namely inflation]{.underline}**. This
month, Biden issued executive orders allowing the use of an ethanol
blend this summer to lower gas prices and to jumpstart a new regulation
fixing the Affordable Care Act's so-called family glitch, which would
lower health insurance costs for millions. And late last week, the
administration announced plans to resume the sale of leases for oil and
gas drilling on federal lands. Having gone overseas to address the
conflict in Ukraine, Biden, for the first time in weeks, boarded Air
Force One to promote the steps he's taken to battle inflation and the
economic impact of that war. Last week, he traveled to Iowa to promote
an effort to lower gas prices and North Carolina to tout measures to
ease supply chain bottlenecks.

\-- a stark contrast to the previous weeks, when the President emerged
regularly to update Americans on new sanctions, intelligence and Western
military assistance. Even as the atrocities of Bucha played out on
television screens across the world this week --- including in the West
Wing, where an outraged Biden and his team watched with horror --- there
were no specific events to address the grim footage. Instead,
**[Biden\'s focus [has been squarely at

The shift comes as **[Biden and his team assess a concerning political
landscape complicated by]{.underline}** the ripple effect of severe
**[economic sanctions]{.underline}** imposed on Moscow. Other recent
developments \-- including a decision to lift pandemic-era restrictions
on the border \-- have contributed to growing unease among Democrats
about November\'s elections. And a recent surge of Covid-19 cases among
Biden\'s circle has acted as a reminder of the virus\' continued
presence. **[Biden\'s response to Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine has done
little to boost his sagging political standing]{.underline}**, despite

46% calling them \"poor\" and another 39% rating them as \"only fair.\"
That\'s worse than a month ago, when 20% of Americans rated conditions
as good or better and 42% said they were poor. Early administration
descriptions of inflation as \"transitory\" have not borne out, and
opened Biden to criticism that the price spike caught his team by
surprise. The Pres**[ident, meanwhile, has sought to balance taking
credit for strong job growth and improving economic indicators with

sought to pin blame for higher prices on Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine,
labeling the sticker shock \"Putin\'s price hike.\" And he has accused
Republicans of resisting his efforts to bring costs down in favor of
pursing an \"ultra-MAGA\" agenda. An official told CNN to **[expect to
see this effort to focus on the economy to continue]{.underline}** for
the rest of the month as **[officials want to convey to voters that

preparing them to see fewer job-creation numbers as the economy
stabilizes.

### L --GOP Fight NATO

#### The GOP are growing increasingly anti-NATO as Ukraine conflict unfolds 

**Blake 4/6**

Aaron, "Why 30 percent of the House GOP voted against reaffirming NATO
support," April 6, 2022
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/06/house-gop-nato-support/dmr

Times have certainly changed.

On Tuesday, **[[63 House Republicans voted against a symbolic resolution
reaffirming support for NATO]{.mark} and its principles, [amid Russia's
invasion of Ukraine. The "no" votes comprised more than 30 percent of
the party's conference]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As with any such symbolic
resolution, it's worth parsing exactly what it contains. Oftentimes,
these resolutions are crafted to force the other party into a
politically difficult vote by including smaller provisions or loaded
language they might object to, then accusing them of opposing the
overall (and often popular) thrust of the bill. But even accounting for
those details, this vote marks the latest shift away from what was once
a bipartisan, consensus view in Congress --- supporting NATO and its
importance in keeping Russia in check. And the shift continues apace.
Few Republicans have commented on their reasons for opposing the
resolution, but writer Will Saletan previewed the vote Tuesday by
**[noting a number of ways in which [the party has drifted in a more
Russia-ambivalent and even NATO-skeptical
direction]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Among the **[[emerging views]{.mark}
he [isolate]{.mark}d: [that NATO was at fault for
provoking]{.mark}]{.underline}** Vladimir **[[Putin, that we should
focus instead on our own Southern border, and that the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[has
no business defending European allies,]{.mark} whether in NATO or
otherwise.]{.underline}**

#### Ukraine sparked [more]{.underline}, not [less]{.underline}, anti-nato sentiment\-\--plan draws backlash from America first lobby

Jonathan **Bernstein**, 4-7-**2022**, Opinion columnist for bloomberg
\"Analysis,\" Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/are-republicans-turning-against-nato/2022/04/07/46c1e36e-b66f-11ec-8358-20aa16355fb4_story.html//DG

Indeed, that commitment outlasted the Cold War. **[Trump didn't care
much about public policy]{.underline}** when he was president. But **[he
did undermine this internationalist consensus]{.underline}**, even
**[using the old "America First" slogan]{.underline}** from an
isolationist (and anti-Semitic) movement from the 1930s. And while
he had little success actually implementing his foreign-policy
preferences --- as he was repeatedly rolled by Congress, the
bureaucracy and allied nations --- it's quite possible **[he could have
the last laugh]{.underline}**. Earlier this week, an astonishing 63
**[House Republicans opposed a resolution supporting
NATO]{.underline}**. That's still not a full third of the Republican
conference, but it's **[not exactly a tiny fringe]{.underline}**,
either. To be fair, some of those objecting claimed to oppose the
non-binding, symbolic resolution because of some of its specific wording
rather than because they opposed the alliance --- but quite a few seem
to be **[wary of the whole concept of an alliance of democracies against
authoritarianism]{.underline}**.These lawmakers are only reflecting
**[where their party appears to be heading]{.underline}**. In two recent
polls, strong minorities of Republicans --- 40% of respondents in one
survey --- supported leaving the alliance altogether.If a Republican
committed to the old consensus wins the 2024 nomination and is elected
president, I'd expect all of that to dissipate pretty rapidly. Both
parties will once again be strong supporters of NATO in particular and
of the general overarching direction of U.S. foreign policy since the
1940s. But if Trump is nominated, and especially if he wins the
presidency, **[it's hard to see the party working as hard to constrain
his foreign-policy choices]{.underline}** as it once did. And if
Democrats remain in the White House for another four years (or more)?
It's easy to imagine **[partisan polarization extending into this
area,]{.underline}** as it has so many others, with Republicans
automatically opposing whatever it is that Democratic presidents are
doing --- including participation in the alliances that Eisenhower,
Nixon, Gerald Ford, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush all
strongly supported. **[Preventing that result would require
strong]{.underline}**, responsible **[leadership from Republican
politicians. I'm not optimistic that will happen]{.underline}**.

#### Trump has made NATO controversial -- his congressional allies will follow the example

**Benitez 19** \[Jorge Benitez is a nonresident senior fellow in the
Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security. He specializes in NATO and
transatlantic relations, European politics, and US national security,
\"U.S. NATO Policy in the Age of Trump: Controversy and Consistency\",
The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs, pg. ProQuest\] GBS-HW

**[Relations between the United States and its European allies are at an
unprecedented stage in transatlantic history. President Donald Trump has
privately and publicly expressed a very negative view of NATO and the
behavior of U.S. allies toward the United States]{.underline}**.
According to NATO\'s former highest military commander, retired Admiral
James Stavridis, \"The alliance is at a moment of high tension\....
Something is new and dangerous.\"2

**[The tone of Trump\'s criticisms of NATO is new and much more divisive
than the disagreements between previous presidents and U.S. allies. They
sometimes exchanged sharp words, but these were usually in private . and
directed at specific allies rather than NATO itself. Trump\'s approach
to NATO is dangerous because no other president has questioned NATO\'s
key role as a fundamental part of U.S. national security.]{.underline}**

Nevertheless, Trump is not alone in his disappointment with the way
allies have treated the United States. **[Earlier presidents and senior
officials may not have been as blunt or threatening, but there is
consistent evidence of a loss of U.S. patience for what is perceived as
feeble attempts by NATO allies to meet their defense commitments to the
Alliance. Therefore, it is important to properly understand what is new
about Trump\'s NATO policy and what is part of a larger trend of
changing U.S. expectations about the Alliance.]{.underline}**

#### GOP support for NATO has wavered -- supporting NATO has become politically partisan

**Parker 22** \[Ashley Parker is the White House Bureau Chief, Marianna
Sotomayor is a Congressional reporter covering the House of
Representatives, and Isaac Stanley-Becker is a National political
reporter, \"Inside the Republican drift away from supporting the NATO
alliance\", Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/29/nato-republicans-trump/\]
GBS-HW

**[In early 2019]{.underline}**, several months after President Donald
Trump threatened to upend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization during
a trip to Brussels for the alliance's annual summit, **[House lawmakers
passed the NATO Support Act amid overwhelming bipartisan support, with
only 22 Republicans voting against the measure.]{.underline}**

**[But this month, when a similar bill in support of NATO during the
Russian invasion of Ukraine again faced a vote in the House, the support
was far more polarized, with 63 Republicans --- 30 percent of the
party's conference --- voting against it.]{.underline}**

**[The vote underscores the Republican Party's remarkable drift away
from NATO in recent years, as positions once considered part of a
libertarian fringe have become doctrine for a growing portion of the
party.]{.underline}**

**[The isolationist posture of some Republicans is in line with the
"America First" ethos of Trump, the GOP's de facto leader, who has long
railed against NATO]{.underline}**. Last week, speaking at a Heritage
Foundation event in Florida, Trump implied that as president he had
threatened not to defend NATO allies from Russian attacks as a
negotiating tactic to pressure them to contribute more money toward the
organization's shared defense.

The vote also comes against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of
Ukraine, which has catapulted NATO to its most prominent role in
decades. And it comes as some hawkish Republicans seek to cast
themselves as stronger opponents of Russia than Democrats.

Metin Hakverdi, a German lawmaker who chairs the North America working
group within the ruling Social Democratic Party, said the question that
preoccupies him is, "Was Donald Trump the exception, or will Joe Biden
be the exception?"

Some two dozen House GOP lawmakers who voted for the 2019 NATO Support
Act voted against the similar resolution this month, which reaffirmed
support for the alliance and its principles. But in interviews, several
of those House Republicans said they still support the organization and
simply objected to what they viewed as problematic provisions that
Democrats had added to the bill for perceived political purposes.

Several who switched their votes since 2019 objected to measures they
said did not specifically address strengthening NATO to help Ukraine.
Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) found it particularly problematic that the
resolution instructed NATO to be involved when a country has "internal
threats from proponents on illiberalism," which he says could be
interpreted as conservatism.

"I am a huge supporter of NATO --- I served in the Air Force during the
Cold War, worked with NATO during that time period," he said. "These
issues should be left to those individual nations."

Loudermilk argued that Democrats had inserted "poison pills" into the
symbolic resolution, which could be used against Republicans in the 2022
midterms. "It was the Democrats trying to politicize something and add
things in there that we have no business working on," he said,
explaining his vote against the bill.

Similarly, from Rep. Robert B. Aderholt (R-Ala.): "I am wholeheartedly,
unequivocally, without reservation, supportive on NATO."

**[But Aderholt said he worried that the resolution "had some language
in that I thought went on the political side. And I don't want to see
NATO go political]{.underline}**. I want to see NATO stand up for, you
know, what's going on in Ukraine --- stand up for Ukraine against
Russia."

The two bills are not exactly the same. The legislation in 2019
reaffirmed that federal money should not be used to remove the United
States from NATO --- which Trump was threatening at the time ---
**[while the bill from this month called on the government to "uphold
the founding democratic principles of NATO," as well for NATO "to
continue to provide unwavering support to the people of Ukraine as they
fight for their sovereignty, territorial integrity, and a democratic
future."]{.underline}**

Another sign of the party's isolationist wing emerged Thursday, as the
House passed an update to a World War II-era military bill creating a
lend-lease program intended to make it easier for the United States to
supply Ukraine with military aid. Only 10 lawmakers --- all Republicans
--- voted against the measure.

In an exchange earlier in the week between Secretary of State Antony
Blinken, who was testifying before Congress, and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.),
Paul pushed back on Blinken's assertion that over the years Russia has
shown a willingness to attack countries like Georgia that are not part
of NATO, while giving wider berth to countries that are members of the
alliance.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on April 26 said while there was no
"justification" for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, there were "reasons"
for the invasion. (Video: Reuters)

"You could also argue the countries they've attacked were part of
Russia, or were part of the Soviet Union," said Paul, who was one of
just two senators who voted against a 2018 bill reaffirming support for
a NATO, in what was at the time a pointed rebuke of Trump.

"Yes, and I firmly disagree with that proposition," Blinken responded.

**[For some foreign policy experts and international allies, the mere
fact that nearly one-third of the Republican conference voted against a
bill that fundamentally seeks to support both NATO and Ukraine
highlights a marked foreign policy evolution in the Republican
Party.]{.underline}**

"We now are really seeing the true impact of deep, deep political
polarization, where it is better to harm the other side than do what's
right for the country," said Heather Conley, president of the German
Marshall Fund. **["This deep domestic polarization has now crept into
foreign and security policy. There has always been strong bipartisan
support for NATO, but everything now has become polarized and can be
weaponized against the other side, even if it supports U.S. national
security interests."]{.underline}**

### L -- Congressional Oversight 

#### Prior Pentagon secrecy ensures the plan's attempt to skirt oversight magnifies the link

**Berger 19** Rick Berger, 7-16-2019, \"The Pentagon should treat

*Rick Berger is a research fellow with the American Enterprise
Institute. He previously served as a staff member on the Senate Budget
Committee.*

A strong U.S. military rests upon broad, bipartisan support among the
American people translated through their representatives in Congress.
Yet, amid the onset of great power competition and a generational
conflict against jihadis, **[[the Pentagon's atrophied outreach to
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}** has undermined support for the U.S.
military. Although the Pentagon's "[Year Without a
Briefing](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/446363-pentagon-reaches-one-year-without-on-camera-briefing-from-top-spokesperson)"
has rightly garnered a great deal of attention, the American public
isn't the only audience getting the cold shoulder from the Department of
Defense. [**The Pentagon has failed to treat Congress as a partner in
executing America's defense strategy. In explanations both of budget
choices and policy decisions, senior [defense leaders have repeatedly
neglected to invest in]{.mark} [relationship building with Capitol Hill
or to provide sufficient information to lawmakers]{.mark} and senior
staff.** **[This]{.mark} administration's penchant for [secrecy]{.mark}
at the Pentagon further [strains an already dysfunctional relationship
based on mutual distrust. If Congress believes it hasn't received
sufficient answers to its oversight questions, it responds with]{.mark}
public excoriations, [punishments and regulatory action]{.mark}s that
levy inefficiency on the daily operations of the Pentagon. [The
building, fearing such outcomes, refuses to share adequate
info]{.mark}rmation with Congress, hoping that such information can be
kept secret, or that congressional complaints will blow over in time. If
nothing else, [the silence emanating from the building engenders
mistrust and cynicism about the choices the military
makes]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Clearly, Congress understands
that some of these strategic messaging and outreach snafus stem from the
White House. In particular, anemic information flow about the
president's decision to
[launder](https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2019/05/15/in_building_the_wall_white_house_digs_deeper_hole_for_the_military_114427.html)
border wall funding through the military or the Office of Management and
Budget's abuse of the overseas contingency operations account cannot be
laid at the Pentagon's feet. But **[[Capitol Hill has proven much less
forgiving of the Pentagon's failures of communication and lack of
outreach.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [**The department**
[**struggled**](https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/hard-choices-and-strategic-insolvency-where-the-national-defense-strategy-falls-short/)
**even to provide a basic account of how the 2020 military budget
request matched the new defense strategy.**]{.underline} This year's
congressional defense legislation is [filled with pages and
pages](https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/05/28/a-flat-budget-will-prove-fatal-for-military-transformation/) expressing
severe bipartisan displeasure over the Pentagon's lack of documentation
and insufficient justifications for important acquisition decisions. In
early March, Congress learned of the plan to decommission the aircraft
carrier Harry S. Truman from the press, and the rationale behind the
decision remained opaque for weeks.

### L -- Defense Unpopular Public

#### Distrust and polarization of the military ensures no DoD action can go undetected by the public 

**Schogol 21** - senior Pentagon reporter with Task & Purpose (Jeff,
"Americans used to trust the military more than the rest of the
government, but now even that's fading," Task & Purpose, 12-3-21,
<https://taskandpurpose.com/news/military-americans-losing-trust/>) //sg

[Americans are **quickly losing trust and confidence** in the U.S.
military, according to the staggering results of a recent survey
conducted by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and
Institute]{.underline}. [The survey found that the number of Americans
who said they have a lot of confidence and trust in the military has
**dropped from 70% to 45%** in just the past three years]{.underline},
and that includes a steep 11 percentage point drop since February, a
Reagan Institute news release says. Roughly 2,500 people took part in
the survey, which was conducted between Oct. 25 and Nov. 7. The
precipitous drop in Americans' confidence in the military comes amid
debates about how to deal with extremism in the ranks, criticisms from
lawmakers that the military is becoming too "woke," fierce arguments
about whether troops should be required to get vaccinated for the novel
coronavirus (COVID-19), and the fall of Afghanistan. However, it's clear
that the survey is not a sign that Americans are turning against the
troops. Of those respondents who said they have a "great deal" of
confidence in the military, 29% cited troops and enlisted service
members as their reason why they felt that way and 15% said their
confidence stems from the military's ability to keep them safe,
according to data provided by the Reagan Institute. "Affection for the
rank and file has been a hallmark of the AVF \[all-volunteer force\]
ever since the Reagan years -- think his 'The Boys of Pointe du Hoc'
speech and the revival of interest in the 'greatest generation,'" said
Peter Feaver, a political science professor at Duke University in North
Carolina. "This survey shows that that still persists." It is more
likely that [the survey results indicate that **Americans are
increasingly viewing the military** --- as an institution --- through
the **lens of partisan politics**]{.underline}. [Among the people who
indicated they have a low degree of confidence in the U.S. military,
**13% cited "political leadership" as a reason**]{.underline}; 9% said
"scandals/sexual assault/lies/cover-ups"; and 8% said they felt the
military was too expensive and had the wrong priorities, according to
the data. Another 15% provided other reasons that were not specified in
the data and 8% said they didn't know why they were not very confident
in the military. "[The fact that 'political leadership' was the
plurality response among those with low confidence]{.underline} (albeit
only a 13% plurality) [may be an indication of the corrosive effects of
**political polarization** in the body politic generally **bleeding over
into attitudes towards the military**]{.underline}," Feaver said. [The
survey indicates that **Republicans in particular** are losing
confidence in the military. For the Reagan Institute's 2018 survey, 87%
of Republican respondents said they had a great deal of confidence in
the military, compared with **53% in 2021**.]{.underline}

### AT Plan is Agency

#### Congress will [pin it]{.underline} on the president

**Sitaraman 19**, Chancellor's Faculty Fellow and Professor of Law at

Internet Policy Research Initiative, JD from Yale Law School (Ganesh,
"The Choice Between Single Director Agencies and Multimember
Commissions," *Administrative Law Review, 71 Admin. L. Rev. 719*)

B. Unity, Responsibility, and Accountability

**[[Every agency is subject to]{.mark} some level of
[\"control\"]{.mark} or oversight [from]{.mark} the
[Legislative]{.mark}]{.underline}** and Judicial **[[Branches]{.mark} of
government, [in addition to]{.mark} the [general
public]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But to the extent one is worried about
holding agencies accountable for their actions, single-director agencies
are generally superior. First, in their very design, single-director
agencies provide a focal point for praising, critiquing, or attempting
to alter agency action. As the Supreme Court noted in Free Enterprise
Fund, \"diffusion of power carries with it a diffusion of
accountability. . . . Without a clear and effective chain of command,
the public cannot \'determine on whom the blame or the punishment of a
pernicious measure, or series of pernicious measures ought really to
fall.\'\" Unified power, on the other hand, \"permits unified
accountability\" and enables \"streamlined, decisive leadership and
decisionmaking.\" A single director has power, and as a result, cannot
place blame on others. \[\*733\] In contrast, multimember commissions
diffuse responsibility for actions among commissioners, making it more
difficult for the various branches\--and the public\--to know who should
be held accountable for particular actions or inactions. \"A gang of
commissioners,\" one scholar notes, \"can always avoid responsibility by
pointing to the other four people who make up the commission.\" If a
particular rule is slowed down at a commission, for example, it is
difficult to know whose fault the delay is. This is not just a problem
from the standpoint of public accountability; it also has tangible
effects on the government\'s ability to function. The President may not
be fully aware of who should be removed from a commissioner position,
and Congress\'s oversight function is hampered because it is unable to
focus its energy at hearings on commissioner-specific issues. As a 1971
report concluded, commissions are \"not sufficiently accountable to
either Congress or the executive branch.\" And even where presidential
removal of a director is not permissible, the broad public can mobilize
for or against an agency director. This public pressure is likely to be
simpler and more effective in the case of a single-director agency than
a multimember commission. There is literature in behavioral psychology
that suggests people have an easier time focusing when directed toward a
specific individual over groups of people. Single-director agencies
offer a personified hero or villain for public interest groups, industry
associations, journalists, and commentators to praise or blame for the
agency\'s actions\--and to push members of Congress to celebrate or
attack those leaders. Thus, conservatives and industry groups could
attack Gina McCarthy, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) under President Obama, while liberals and environmental groups
could organize \[\*734\] around opposing Scott Pruitt, the head of the
EPA under President Trump. Personified praise and blame against the
single directors of the CFPB and Department of Education are similar.
Even aside from partisan opposition, public pressure against a single
director can lead to a director\'s resignation or removal when unfit for
the role. **[One could argue that blaming a director might be a mistake,
given that the director could simply be responding to the President\'s
policy preferences. But in such cases, the [line of accountability runs
through the President]{.mark} and [the Pres]{.mark}ident [would]{.mark}
also [take]{.mark} some of [the blame for]{.mark} her [appointee\'s
decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In other words, public preferences
might be directed at the agency head or the President, but in both cases
accountability values are served by single-director agencies.

### AT Plan is Executive

#### Executive action magnifies the link

Moreover, other institutions, particularly [**[Congress]{.underline}**,
**[may play an∂ important role]{.underline}**]{.mark}---even when
presidents know that efforts to overturn an∂ executive action will
fail---**[[by engaging in the political debate and∂ mobilizing public
pressure against the president should he act unilaterally∂ contra
congressional preferences.]{.mark} [Decades of political science
scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline}**[∂ **[have
demonstrated]{.underline}**]{.mark} that [**[the]{.underline}**
**[public]{.underline}**]{.mark} lacks systematic knowledge∂ of politics
and therefore **[[relies]{.mark} heavily [on heuristics when
forming]{.mark} their∂ political [judgments]{.mark}]{.underline}**.48
**[Political [elites]{.mark} thus [become key
cue-give]{.mark}rs]{.underline}** who∂ help inform and shape public
opinion.49 Finally, citizens acquire most∂ of their knowledge about
politics from the mass media. **[Scholars have∂ long noted that the
media depend on official Washington sources for∂
information]{.underline}**. However, a robust literature in political
communications∂ goes further and argues that the media tend "to 'index'
the range of∂ voices and viewpoints in both news and editorials
according to the∂ range of views expressed in mainstream government
debate about a∂ given topic."50 **[[When]{.underline}]{.mark}** other
political actors, particularly members of∂ **[[Congress]{.mark}, object
and [criticize presidential actions]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the public
sphere,∂ **[[they are]{.mark} all but [assured of receiving considerable
media coverage]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark}∂
**[they [are well-positioned to influence public opinion against the∂
executive]{.mark} branch]{.underline}**.51∂ In essence, we argue that
**[while]{.underline}** the statutory and **[legal constraints∂ on
presidential unilateral power are weak]{.underline}**, the **[political
constraints are]{.underline}**∂ **[quite robust]{.underline}**.52
**[[Unilateral actions]{.mark} that]{.underline}** could **[[provoke

political capital]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[thereby [undermining later
efforts∂ to pursue other aspects of the
president's]{.mark}]{.underline}** programmatic
**[[agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}**, may∂ fail a simple cost-benefit
calculation. The **[informal political costs of∂
acting]{.underline}**---even when Congress and the courts are almost
certainly∂ unwilling or unable to strike down the action---may
**[outweigh]{.underline}** the policy∂ **[benefits]{.underline}** of
acting unilaterally. **[These political costs, which are
not]{.underline}**∂ **[accounted for in most extant models of unilateral
politics, are]{.underline}** tangible∂ and
**[substantial]{.underline}**; indeed, **[they]{.underline}** may

across the gamut of∂ policy as formal models suggest they should.

#### Unilateral action ensures backlash from both sides of the aisle

**Sensiba 20** \-- Jennifer Sensiba, journalist. \[Don't Encourage Biden
To Waste Political Capital, 11-6-20,
https://cleantechnica.com/2020/11/06/dont-encourage-biden-to-waste-political-capital/\]

**[[Executive Power Is Expensive]{.underline}]{.mark}** While Trump
abused executive power frequently, don't be tempted by calls for Biden
to take revenge and do the same thing. **[The short term gains may be
enticing, but the [longer]{.mark} term [costs are]{.mark} much [bigger
than they]{.mark} might [appear]{.mark} to be at first]{.underline}**.
Trump found out the hard way that pushing for things like the border
wall, fights against LGBT rights, and attempts to prop up the failing
coal industry alienates reasonable people. It's easy to say "Trump did
it! We can too!", but don't forget that was part of his undoing. The
worst thing a President Biden could do is use unconstitutional executive
orders for something divisive like gun control. Yes, Trump actually did
this, because he thought it would make him look good after the Las Vegas
shooting, but it divided his own supporters. Loyalists made excuses or
claimed it was part of some elaborate game to "beat the libs," while
people who really believed in gun rights deeply lost trust in Trump.
Make no mistake, **[a Democratic [president]{.mark}]{.underline}** doing
this **[[would]{.mark} quickly [earn]{.mark} the [hostilities of]{.mark}
both [camps and suffer]{.mark} a [deeper cost than Trump]{.mark}
did]{.underline}**. That's just one example. **[[There are]{.mark} many
other little [regulatory things]{.mark}]{.underline}** a President
**[[Biden could do]{.mark} to put the screws to Republicans, but [in
most cases it]{.mark} simply [isn't worth it when we need]{.mark} real
[legislation]{.mark} to get the job done]{.underline}**.

#### Biden [gets the blame]{.underline} for agency action

University (Kathryn E., "Rules About Rulemaking and The Rise of the
Unitary Executive," *Administrative Law Review, 70 Admin. L. Rev. 515*,
Lexis)

Clearly, there are other reasons for this phenomenon: among them, **[the
[President\'s]{.mark}]{.underline}** desire to take political credit or,
on the flip side, his **[[recognition]{.mark} that, [whatever the
outcome]{.mark}, he [will be saddled with]{.mark} the [political blame.
The]{.mark} American [public]{.mark} seems to [equate the
Pres]{.mark}ident [with the Fourth Branch]{.mark}. Advances in
[tech]{.mark}nology [and media]{.mark} may be [exacerbating this]{.mark}
effect]{.underline}**. This phenomenon, however, cuts both ways. The
President may be inclined to make policy decisions himself so that he
can take the credit if the outcome is politically popular, but he may
prefer to leave policymaking to his subordinates so that he can distance
himself if the outcome is not politically popular. This does not,
therefore, account fully for the dramatic \[\*557\] rise in presidential
direct action described below.

Here, **[we]{.underline}** take a different tack and **[emphasize the
informal political]{.underline}**∂ **[costs of unilateral
action]{.underline}**. Specifically, we argue that **[presidents
consider]{.underline}**∂ **[more than just whether
Congress]{.underline}** or the courts **[will act affirmatively
to]{.underline}**∂ **[overturn a unilateral presidential]{.underline}**
order. Rather, **[presidents]{.underline}** **[consider]{.underline}**
the∂ **[longer-term political costs that unilateral action may
entail]{.underline}**. These∂ political costs can take many forms, two
of which are particularly∂ important. First, **[when presidents act
unilaterally]{.underline}**, **[they]{.underline}** may
**[burn]{.underline}**∂ **[bridges with members of Congress opposed to
the action on political,∂ ideological, or even constitutional
grounds]{.underline}**. To be sure, in almost all∂ circumstances,
presidents will be able to carry the day and beat back∂ any legislative
effort to undo what they have done unilaterally.∂ However, **[the ill
will so generated on Capitol Hill may prove politically]{.underline}**∂
**[costly the next time the president's policy wishes require action
that∂ only Congress can take]{.underline}**. For example, despite being
a rather blunt∂ instrument, Congress retains the power of the purse and
therefore,∂ ultimately, the power to support or de-fund most policies
that∂ presidents begin unilaterally.40 **[This echoes]{.underline}**
Neustadt's moral from the∂ "three cases of command"---**[Truman's firing
of General Douglas]{.underline}**∂ **[MacArthur and seizure of the steel
mills during the Korean War, and∂ Eisenhower federalizing the Arkansas

Congress to approve the sale of advanced weapons and other equipment for
Turkey's fleet of F-16 fighter jets, The Wall Street Journal reported
this week.  But seven advocacy **[organizations are raising alarm that
Congress should apply strict scrutiny and oversight to any potential
sales or transfer]{.underline}** of fighter jets or major weapons
systems **[to Turkey, which is an ally of the United States in
NATO]{.underline}**.  Separate letters were sent Friday to Senate and
House lawmakers by the Hellenic American Leadership Council; Armenian
National Committee of America; the American Jewish Committee; In Defense
of Christians, the Middle East Forum; American Friends of Kurdistan and
the International Coordinating Committee --- Justice for Cyprus (PSEKA).
The letters were sent to the chairs and ranking members of the House
Foreign Affairs and Armed Services committees, and the Senate Foreign
Relations and Armed Services committees. **[The organizations raised
"alarm]{.underline}**" over the Biden administration's request that
Congress approve the sale of 80 modernization kits for its existing

"positive and productive meeting."  Administration officials have
publicly praised Turkey's role in opposing Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
It has buttressed security in the Black Sea, provided key weapons to
Kyiv and served as a strategic intermediary with Moscow. "Turkey is
proving itself to be a key, helpful and strategic ally of the U.S.,"
Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia Affairs Karen
Donfried told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during a hearing on
Thursday.  But **[Erdoğan on Friday voiced opposition to expanding
NATO]{.underline}** to allow Finland and Sweden to join. Both are being
welcomed as future members by the U.S. and other NATO allies. 
Washington and Ankara have had tense relations for years. The U.S.
kicked Turkey out of its F-35 fighter jet program in 2019 following
Ankara's purchase of the Russian S-400 missile defense system. The U.S.
also imposed sanctions on Turkey in 2020 under a federal law, called
CAATSA, for the continued possession of the Russian missile defense
system.  The American Jewish Committee in its letter **[urged Congress
to prevent the weapons sales]{.underline}** unless Turkey can be proven
to be in compliance with CAATSA and "**[assurances can be made that
advanced American technology will not be left vulnerable to Russian and
Chinese systems]{.underline}**."

Analyses of transatlantic relations, and security relations in
particular, often focus on differences between the United States and its
European allies. This clearly is an important factor. Given Europe's
dependence on US security guarantees, the United States' continued
willingness to engage in the continent's security is the condition sine
qua non for NATO's survival. **[US dissatisfaction with European
engagement and defense spending has consequently been a key item on

A HOUSE DIVIDED

**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**nother **[[problem with U.S. military
assistance concerns divisions on the American side. Washington does not
always come to a consensus]{.mark} on the parameters and purpose of its
help]{.underline}**. **[[This]{.mark} confusion [undermines a program's
efficacy]{.mark} and can result in unmitigated disaster.]{.underline}**

Again, consider Vietnam. The man the Pentagon put in charge of assisting
the South Vietnamese military from 1955 to 1960 was Lieutenant General
Samuel Williams, a commander who had received a battlefield demotion
during World War II due to incompetence. Williams repeatedly clashed
with U.S. embassy officials in Saigon, kowtowed to Diem, and remained
committed to building a conventional South Vietnamese military, contrary
to the wishes of the White House and the CIA. At a time when there were
more than enough problems among its Vietnamese allies, Washington was
needlessly undermining its own efforts. It repeated that mistake **[[in
Lebanon in the 1980s]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the wake of Israel's
1982 invasion of the country, the Reagan administration dispatched U.S.
troops to serve in a multinational peacekeeping force and to
professionalize Lebanon's military. But **[[Washington failed to
establish a consensus on the purpose of]{.mark} its
[involvement]{.mark}. What began as a 30-day mission to oversee the
withdrawal of the P]{.underline}**alestine **[L]{.underline}**iberation
**[O]{.underline}**rganization **[from Beirut turned into a vague and
open-ended commitment to support Lebanese stability and security. Senior
U.S. [policymakers disagreed sharply]{.mark} over the scope of the U.S.
role in Lebanon---in particular, the extent to which the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[should directly
support Lebanon's military in combat operations. [Not surprisingly,
then, officials sent mixed messages]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Although
officially speaking, the U.S. government was invested in the stability
and security of the Lebanese state, **[one senior U.S. policymaker broke
ranks and encouraged the commander of the armed forces to lead a
military coup]{.underline}**. **[[This disunity laid the
groundwork]{.mark} not only [for a convoluted program]{.mark} but also
for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. military and diplomatic
personnel]{.underline}**. Two spectacular attacks in 1983 on the U.S.
embassy and marine barracks in Beirut illustrated that at least some
actors saw the United States as a combatant in the conflict, despite
efforts to characterize itself as playing a supporting role. By early
1984, portions of the Lebanese military had melted away amid increased
violence, and **[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[withdrew]{.mark} from Lebanon,
[having failed to make the state more]{.mark} stable or

#### The Link alone turns the case -- Politicized fights destroy cooperation effectiveness 

**Young 2020**

Thomas-Durell, phd, Senior Lecturer at the Naval Postgraduate School,
"The \"Politics\" of Security Cooperation and Security Assistance"
September 10, 2020,
https://www.dasadec.army.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2344014/the-politics-of-security-cooperation-and-security-assistance/dmr

The objective of this article is to argue that **[administration
officials and Congress face two different political challenges related
to improving SC and SA. Unless]{.underline}** and until U.S.
**[officials formulate solutions to these political problems, both
branches of government will struggle to achieve more effective means of
reforming partner nations' key governmental institutions]{.underline}**.
First---and perhaps the easiest challenge to address---is that SC and SA
have unintended political consequences in the government institutions of
recipient countries and are not solely technical tasks. No one has
expressed this point better than Mara Karlin, albeit she was speaking in
reference to weak states: Past experience offers two key lessons for
U.S. officials as they seek to strengthen the security sectors of weak
states. First, like all state-building endeavors, these are political,
not technical, exercises. Instead of focusing narrowly on training and
equipment, U.S. policymakers responsible for implementing such programs
must address the purpose and scope of the U.S. role and the mission,
leadership, and organizational structure of the partner's military.9
Second**[, [SC and SA are highly politicized; both are inefficient,
because of the lack of coordination between the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Department of Defense (**[[DOD) and]{.underline}]{.mark}** Department of
[**[State]{.underline}**,]{.mark} and ineffective, because of lack of
alignment with national security goals (and/or foreign policy
objectives**[). [This important reality needs wider appreciation by
these departments, as well as by Congress,]{.mark}]{.underline}** if the
U.S. Government is to improve its ability to find value for money by
improving partner nations' ability to defend their sovereignty, let
alone contribute to expeditionary operations. **[Recent reforms
initiated by Congress]{.underline}**, most notably **[in
the]{.underline}** fiscal year (FY) **[2017]{.underline}** National
Defense Authorization Act (**[NDAA), constitute a good first effort at
addressing these longstanding problems; however, a review of the
evidence shows that this legislation should be augmented to define the
problem as largely political in nature, as opposed to accepting the
traditional default assumption that it is solely
technical]{.underline}**, which would have enabled it to call for even
deeper reforms within these bureaucracies. This article argues that,
**[[due to internal DOD politics and the interorganizational politics
within the U.S. Government, suboptimal results ensue
from]{.mark}]{.underline}** the way the United States plans and executes
**[[SC and SA]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It then suggests legislative and
policy changes that might better take this reality into account. The
stakes are high. If U.S. strategy is to bring troops home from the
so-called endless wars overseas and let others do the fighting, then its
success must be a core priority. But only by reforming the way the
United States organizes itself to build allies' and partners' armed
forces are we likely to meet with any greater success than we have in
the past.

https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-06-05/progressive-democrats-should-admit-joe-manchin-was-right

All this time, it's worth noting, the **[one piece of the legislation
that Democrats made sure to keep permanent was providing tax credits to
subsidize the production of zero-carbon energy]{.underline}**. This was
structured to try to be more neutral between technologies than America's
current climate subsidies, to be permanent rather than temporary, and to
be far simpler and more efficient than the current system. **[This part
of the puzzle was well-designed in its parameters, is]{.underline}** at
least somewhat **[anti-inflationary in its implications, and is easy to
pay for in the context of a package that in the aggregate reduces the
deficit by taxing the rich. Manchin has never rejected these
ideas]{.underline}** outright, and his staff continues to negotiate with
other senators about their exact design. **[Anyone who cares about
inflation, climate change or]{.underline}** the Biden administration's
**[legacy should hope that he and his interlocutors can get to
yes]{.underline}**. A good starting point would be for everyone to admit
that **[this]{.underline}** approach **[isn't just a second-best
alternative to Build Back Better, it's actually superior]{.underline}**
--- and that the senator from West Virginia has had a point all along.

RICK NEWMAN: So **[obviously]{.underline}** President **[Biden wants to

Senator Joe **[Manchin]{.underline}**, the scourge of the Democratic
Party. We\'re hearing that there is a chance **[that Democrats could
still pass some kind of]{.underline}** so-called **[reconciliation
bill]{.underline}**. But instead of being Build Back Better, which
became Build Back Lesser, which became Build Back Never, that stuff\'s
all out. This bill would have to be **[an inflation fighting
bill]{.underline}**. Now, it\'s not really clear how they could do that.
But **[there are some]{.underline}** programs or **[proposals
tha]{.underline}**t Biden says might **[help with inflation, such as
subsidies for health care and child care]{.underline}** and things like
that. There\'s an argument that **[raising taxes on businesses a little

current carbon-reduction targets could require installing the equivalent
of the world's current largest solar park every day for the rest of this
decade.5 Given the magnitude of the changes we foresee, long-term
investors may find opportunities in the technologies and innovations
that create renewable energy sources or reduce the carbon intensity of
energy production. The role of renewable energy in reaching net zero
**[To]{.underline}** help **[spur]{.underline}** **[the economic
transformation, governments and companies are pledging]{.underline}**
commitments **[to become "net zero."]{.underline}** Net zero is about
reducing greenhouse gas emissions so that over time we can achieve an
overall balance between emissions produced, and the emissions removed
from the overall atmosphere. So, for every ton of greenhouse gas emitted
into the air, a ton needs to be taken out. More than 125 governments
around the world and more than 1,000 companies have made or are
preparing to make net zero commitments. We expect that number to go up.
**[Attaining [net zero will require huge
investments]{.mark}]{.underline}**, changes in business models, and
innovation. Major energy producers say that **[oil]{.underline}**
production **[likely peaked in 2019, and the race is on for cheap, clean

by midcentury, annual clean energy investment will need to more than

(ETFs) are a convenient way to target companies and issuers at the

#### Extinction. 

**Kareiva 18**, Ph.D. in ecology and applied mathematics from Cornell
University, director of the Institute of the Environment and
Sustainability at UCLA, Pritzker Distinguished Professor in Environment
& Sustainability at UCLA, et al. (Peter, "Existential risk due to
ecosystem collapse: Nature strikes back," *Futures*, 102)

In summary, six of the nine proposed planetary boundaries (phosphorous,
nitrogen, biodiversity, land use, atmospheric aerosol loading, and
chemical pollution) are unlikely to be associated with existential
risks. They all correspond to a degraded environment, but in our
assessment do not represent existential risks. However, the three
remaining boundaries (**[[climate]{.mark} [change]{.mark}, global
freshwater cycle, [and]{.mark} ocean
[acidification]{.mark}]{.underline}**) do **[[pose existential
risks]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[This is [because of]{.mark} intrinsic
[positive feedback loops]{.mark}]{.underline}**, substantial lag times
between system change and experiencing the consequences of that change,
**[[and]{.mark} the fact these different boundaries interact with one
another in ways that yield [surprises]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
addition, **[[climate]{.mark}, freshwater, [and]{.mark} ocean
[acidification are]{.mark} all [directly connected to]{.mark} the
provision of [food and water]{.mark}, and
[shortages]{.mark}]{.underline}** of food and water can **[[create
conflict]{.mark} and social unrest]{.underline}**. Climate change has a
long history of disrupting civilizations and sometimes precipitating the
collapse of cultures or mass emigrations (McMichael, 2017). For example,
the 12th century drought in the North American Southwest is held
responsible for the collapse of the Anasazi pueblo culture. More
recently, the infamous potato famine of 1846--1849 and the large
migration of Irish to the U.S. can be traced to a combination of
factors, one of which was climate. Specifically, 1846 was an unusually
warm and moist year in Ireland, providing the climatic conditions
favorable to the fungus that caused the potato blight. As is so often
the case, poor government had a role as well---as the British government
forbade the import of grains from outside Britain (imports that could
have helped to redress the ravaged potato yields). **[[Climate]{.mark}
[change]{.mark} intersects with freshwater resources because it [is
expected to exacerbate]{.mark} drought and]{.underline}** **[[water
scarcity]{.mark},]{.underline}** as well as flooding. Climate change can
even impair water quality because it is associated with heavy rains that
overwhelm sewage treatment facilities, or because it results in higher
concentrations of pollutants in groundwater as a result of enhanced
evaporation and reduced groundwater recharge. **[Ample [clean
water]{.mark}]{.underline}** is not a luxury---it **[[is essential for
human survival]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Consequently, cities, regions and
nations that lack clean freshwater are vulnerable to social disruption
and disease. Finally, ocean acidification is linked to climate change
because it is driven by CO2 emissions just as global warming is. With
close to 20% of the world's protein coming from oceans (FAO, 2016), the
potential for severe impacts due to acidification is obvious. Less
obvious, but perhaps more insidious, is the interaction between climate
change and the loss of oyster and coral reefs due to acidification.
Acidification is known to interfere with oyster reef building and coral
reefs. **[[Climate change]{.mark} also [increases storm]{.mark}
[frequency]{.mark} and severity. Coral reefs and oyster reefs provide
protection from storm surge because they reduce wave
energy]{.underline}** (Spalding et al., 2014). **[If these reefs are
lost due to acidification at the same time as storms become more severe
and sea level rises]{.underline}**, **[[coastal communities will
be]{.mark} [exposed to unprecedented storm
surge]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[and may be ravaged by recurrent
storms]{.underline}**. A key feature of the risk associated with climate
change is that mean annual temperature and mean annual rainfall are not
the variables of interest. Rather it is extreme episodic events that
place nations and entire regions of the world at risk. These extreme
events are by definition "rare" (once every hundred years), and changes
in their likelihood are challenging to detect because of their rarity,
but are exactly the manifestations of climate change that we must get
better at anticipating (Diffenbaugh et al., 2017). **[[Society will have
a hard time responding to short]{.mark}er [intervals between]{.mark}
rare [extreme events]{.mark}]{.underline}** because in the lifespan of
an individual human, a person might experience as few as two or three
extreme events. How likely is it that you would notice a change in the
interval between events that are separated by decades, especially given
that the interval is not regular but varies stochastically? A concrete
example of this dilemma can be found in the past and expected future
changes in storm-related flooding of New York City. The highly
disruptive flooding of New York City associated with Hurricane Sandy
represented a flood height that occurred once every 500 years in the
18th century, and that occurs now once **[every 25 years, but is
expected to occur once every 5 years by 2050]{.underline}** (Garner et
al., 2017). This change in frequency of extreme floods has profound
implications for the measures New York City should take to protect its
infrastructure and its population, yet because of the stochastic nature
of such events, this shift in flood frequency is an elevated risk that
will go unnoticed by most people. 4. The combination of positive
feedback loops and societal inertia is fertile ground for global
environmental catastrophes **[Humans are remarkably ingenious, and have
adapted to crises throughout their history]{.underline}**. Our doom has
been repeatedly predicted, only to be averted by innovation (Ridley,
2011). **[However, the many [stories of]{.mark} human ingenuity
[successfully addressing existential risks]{.mark}]{.underline}** such
as global famine or extreme air pollution **[[represent]{.mark}
environmental [challenges that are]{.mark} largely [linear, have
immediate]{.mark} [consequences, and operate without]{.mark} positive
[feedbacks]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For example, the fact that food is in
short supply does not increase the rate at which humans consume
food---thereby increasing the shortage. Similarly, massive air pollution
episodes such as the London fog of 1952 that killed 12,000 people did
not make future air pollution events more likely. In fact it was just
the opposite---the London fog sent such a clear message that Britain
quickly enacted pollution control measures (Stradling, 2016). Food
shortages, air pollution, water pollution, etc. send immediate signals
to society of harm, which then trigger a negative feedback of society
seeking to reduce the harm. In contrast, today's great environmental
crisis of climate change may cause some harm but there are generally
long time delays between rising CO2 concentrations and damage to humans.
The consequence of these delays are an absence of urgency; thus although
70% of Americans believe global warming is happening, only 40% think it
will harm them
(http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2016/).
Secondly, **[unlike past environmental challenges, the Earth's
[climate]{.mark} system [is rife with positive feedback]{.mark}
loop[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[In particular, as CO2 increases and
the climate warms, that very [warming can cause more CO2]{.mark}
[release]{.mark} which further increases global warming, and then more
CO2, and so on]{.underline}**. Table 2 summarizes the best documented
positive feedback loops for the Earth's climate system. These feedbacks
can be neatly categorized into carbon cycle, biogeochemical,
biogeophysical, cloud, ice-albedo, and water vapor feedbacks. As
important as it is to understand these feedbacks individually, it is
even more essential to study the interactive nature of these feedbacks.
Modeling studies show that when interactions among feedback loops are
included, uncertainty increases dramatically and there is a heightened
potential for perturbations to be magnified (e.g., Cox, Betts, Jones,
Spall, & Totterdell, 2000; Hajima, Tachiiri, Ito, & Kawamiya, 2014;
Knutti & Rugenstein, 2015; Rosenfeld, Sherwood, Wood, & Donner, 2014).
This produces a wide range of future scenarios. Positive feedbacks in
the carbon cycle involves the enhancement of future carbon contributions
to the atmosphere due to some initial increase in atmospheric CO2. This
happens because as CO2 accumulates, it reduces the efficiency in which
oceans and terrestrial ecosystems sequester carbon, which in return
feeds back to exacerbate climate change (Friedlingstein et al., 2001).
Warming can also increase the rate at which organic matter decays and
carbon is released into the atmosphere, thereby causing more warming
(Melillo et al., 2017). Increases in food shortages and lack of water is
also of major concern when biogeophysical feedback mechanisms perpetuate
drought conditions. The underlying mechanism here is that losses in
vegetation increases the surface albedo, which suppresses rainfall, and
thus enhances future vegetation loss and more suppression of
rainfall---thereby initiating or prolonging a drought (Chamey, Stone, &
Quirk, 1975). To top it off, overgrazing depletes the soil, leading to
augmented vegetation loss (Anderies, Janssen, & Walker, 2002). Climate
change often also increases the risk of forest fires, as a result of
higher temperatures and persistent drought conditions. **[The
expectation is that forest [fires will become more]{.mark}
[frequent]{.mark} and severe with climate warming and
drought]{.underline}** (Scholze, Knorr, Arnell, & Prentice, 2006), a
trend for which we have already seen evidence (Allen et al., 2010).
Tragically, the increased severity and risk of Southern California
wildfires recently predicted by climate scientists (Jin et al., 2015),
was realized in December 2017, with the largest fire in the history of
California (the "Thomas fire" that burned 282,000 acres,
https://www.vox.com/2017/12/27/16822180/thomas-fire-california-largest-wildfire).
**[This [catastrophic fire]{.mark} embodies the sorts of positive
feedbacks and interacting factors that [could catch humanity
off-guard]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[and produce a]{.mark} true
[apocalyptic event]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Record-breaking rains
produced an extraordinary flush of new vegetation, that then dried out
as record heat waves and dry conditions took hold, coupled with stronger
than normal winds, and ignition. Of course the record-fire released CO2
into the atmosphere, thereby contributing to future warming. Out of all
types of feedbacks, water vapor and the ice-albedo feedbacks are the
most clearly understood mechanisms. Losses in reflective snow and ice
cover drive up surface temperatures, leading to even more melting of
snow and ice cover---this is known as the ice-albedo feedback (Curry,
Schramm, & Ebert, 1995). As snow and ice continue to melt at a more
rapid pace, millions of people may be displaced by flooding risks as a
consequence of sea level rise near coastal communities (Biermann & Boas,
2010; Myers, 2002; Nicholls et al., 2011). The water vapor feedback
operates when warmer atmospheric conditions strengthen the saturation
vapor pressure, which creates a warming effect given water vapor's
strong greenhouse gas properties (Manabe & Wetherald, 1967). Global
warming tends to increase cloud formation because warmer temperatures
lead to more evaporation of water into the atmosphere, and warmer
temperature also allows the atmosphere to hold more water. The key
question is whether this increase in clouds associated with global
warming will result in a positive feedback loop (more warming) or a
negative feedback loop (less warming). For decades, scientists have
sought to answer this question and understand the net role clouds play
in future climate projections (Schneider et al., 2017). Clouds are
complex because they both have a cooling (reflecting incoming solar
radiation) and warming (absorbing incoming solar radiation) effect
(Lashof, DeAngelo, Saleska, & Harte, 1997). The type of cloud, altitude,
and optical properties combine to determine how these countervailing
effects balance out. Although still under debate, it appears that in
most circumstances the cloud feedback is likely positive (Boucher et
al., 2013). For example, models and observations show that increasing
greenhouse gas concentrations reduces the low-level cloud fraction in
the Northeast Pacific at decadal time scales. This then has a positive
feedback effect and enhances climate warming since less solar radiation
is reflected by the atmosphere (Clement, Burgman, & Norris, 2009).
**[The key lesson from the long list of potentially positive feedbacks
and their interactions is that]{.underline}** **[[runaway climate
change]{.mark}, and runaway perturbations have to be taken as a serious
possibility]{.underline}**. Table 2 is just a snapshot of the type of
feedbacks that have been identified (see Supplementary material for a
more thorough explanation of positive feedback loops). However, **[this
list is not exhaustive and the possibility of undiscovered positive
feedbacks [portends]{.mark} even greater [existential
risk]{.mark}]{.underline}**s. The many environmental crises humankind
has previously averted (famine, ozone depletion, London fog, water
pollution, etc.) were averted because of political will based on solid
scientific understanding. We cannot count on complete scientific
understanding when it comes to positive feedback loops and climate
change.

### I/L -- Bill Solves Climate

#### Bill solves climate -- RE subsidies are temporary and complex -- that discourages innovation

**Yglesias 6/5**

It," June 5, 2022
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-06-05/progressive-democrats-should-admit-joe-manchin-was-right

All this time, it's worth noting, the **[one piece of the legislation
that Democrats made sure to keep permanent was providing tax credits to
subsidize the production of zero-carbon energy. This was structured to
try to be more neutral between technologies than America's current
climate subsidies, to be permanent rather than temporary, and to be far
simpler and more efficient than the current system.]{.underline}**
**[This part of the puzzle was well-designed in its parameters,
is]{.underline}** at least somewhat **[anti-inflationary in its
implications]{.underline}**, and is easy to pay for in the context of a
package that in the aggregate reduces the deficit by taxing the rich.
Manchin has never rejected these ideas outright, and his staff continues
to negotiate with other senators about their exact design. **[Anyone who
cares about inflation, climate change or]{.underline}** the Biden
administration's **[legacy should hope that he and his interlocutors can
get to yes]{.underline}**. A good starting point would be for everyone
to admit that **[this]{.underline}** approach **[isn't just a
second-best alternative to Build Back Better, it's actually
superior]{.underline}** --- and that the senator from West Virginia has
had a point all along.

#### Also solves by averting interest rate hikes which crush renewables and lock in warming

**[[Renewable energy is]{.underline}]{.mark}** an

**[[warming]{.underline}]{.mark}** to **[below 2°C]{.underline}**
relative to the pre-​industrial age **[[will not be
achieved]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Policymakers have therefore introduced
various support measures for renewable energy, in particular in the EU
-- and not without success: the generation costs of alternative energy
in many European countries today are comparable with the (marginal)
costs of existing gas or coal-​fired power stations.
**[The]{.underline}** **[last two years have seen the widespread
emergence of]{.underline}**
**[p]{.underline}**hoto**[v]{.underline}**oltaic **[plants that can
survive and hold their own on the market without
subsidies]{.underline}** -- for example, in Spain and Germany. **[[Green
electricity's]{.mark} new-​found [competitiveness is based
on]{.mark}]{.underline}** more mature technology and higher volumes,
which bring down costs. In addition -- and this is often overlooked --
**[[the low cost of capital]{.mark} has also played its part, as [low
interest rates boost]{.mark} the economic viability of [alternative
energy]{.mark} sources]{.underline}**. Lower costs thanks to low
interest rates But **[what happens if interest rates
rise?]{.underline}** ETH researchers have explored this question in two
studies. As **[[renewable energy is more capital-​intensive than
fossil]{.mark} [fuels, the costs rise]{.mark} more [sharply with
rising]{.mark} interest [rates]{.mark}, making it less
attractive]{.underline}**. "**[[Renewable]{.mark} [energy]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} now very [cheap, but that won't]{.mark}]{.underline}**
necessarily **[[be the case with higher interest
rates]{.underline}]{.mark}**," says Tobias Schmidt, Professor of Energy
Politics. According to Schmidt, analysis of 133 photovoltaic and onshore
wind projects in Germany over the last 18 years shows that -- in the
case of wind power, for example -- lower financing costs account for
about 25% of the savings in electricity-​production costs (see article in
Nature Energycall_made). "**[Renewable energy has become cheaper --
thanks]{.underline}** in part **[to significant improvements in
financing conditions]{.underline}**," says Bjarne Steffen, co-​author of
the study. **[Conversely, [rising]{.mark} financing [costs will lead to
disproportionate increases in the price]{.mark} of renewable
energy.]{.underline}** Less attractive with rising interest rates In a
study published today in Nature Sustainability, the ETH researchers
calculated various interest rate scenarios in collaboration with a team
from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). **[If
interest rates were to return]{.underline}** to pre-​crisis levels,
**[electricity production costs]{.underline}** in Germany **[would
increase]{.underline}** by 11% for solar power plants and 25% for wind
power projects -- **[[with a knock-​on impact on
competitiveness]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[In a scenario involving a
moderate rise in interest rates, the [lower costs]{.mark} of solar power
plants [due to]{.mark} advances in knowledge and [tech]{.mark}nology
[would be offset]{.mark} by higher interest charges.]{.underline}** For
wind power stations, it is estimated that electricity generation costs
would increase by 9% in such a scenario.

#### Prolonged inflation [crashes]{.underline} the economy\-\--[even without]{.underline} rate hikes.

Damage to the economy **[A [prolonged]{.mark} bout of high [inflation

have already cut back on purchases of new cars and other goods because
of record prices. A recent survey found that consumers say it's the
worst time to buy a car since the early 1980s. **[What could also pose a
risk to the economy is if the Fed moves to squelch inflation by raising
interest rates more rapidly]{.underline}** than it plans. **[A series of
[rapid]{.mark} interest-[rate hikes could choke off]{.mark} U.S.
[economic growth and sent]{.mark} stock [markets

markets and the economy]{.underline}**," said senior economist Sal
Guatieri of BMO Capital Markets. Yet the likelihood of the Powell Fed
acting so aggressively appears dim, other analysts say. The central bank
is more focused on ensuring a strong U.S. jobs market and low
unemployment and less worried about a sustained period of high
inflation. Stanley of Amherst Pierpont believes **[[the Fed will
raise]{.underline}]{.mark}** interest **[[rates
slowly]{.underline}]{.mark}** even if inflation remains elevated,
possibly **[[making it harder]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the central

the Great Depression. Yet it is the details behind that dismal forecast
that should raise concerns within the U.S. and Europe. **[Their
[steep]{.mark}er [economic decline and slow]{.mark}er [recovery could
lay the seeds for a long-lasting shift]{.mark} of global tectonic plates
[to China's advantage]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The IMF projected a U.S.
economic decline of about 6% in 2020 and a contraction of the eurozone
of 7.5%. That compares to projected Chinese economic growth for 2020 of
1.2% after a first quarter real decline of 6.7% -- far less than the
10%-plus dip many experts had expected. The only group of countries in
the world projected to be in positive territory are East Asian, at
roughly 1%. Even if one accepts that Chinese coronavirus fatalities
likely are greater than their public figures and that the growth decline
is likely larger, that doesn't change the potential for a scenario that
Deloitte and Salesforce this week [referred
to](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/covid-19/covid-19-scenarios-and-impacts-for-business-and-society-world-remade.html)
as "Sunrise in the East." Describing this scenario, as one of four
possibilities they list, they write, "**[The global center of power
shifts decisively east as [China]{.mark}]{.underline}** and other East
Asian nations **[take the reigns]{.underline}** as primary powers **[on
the world stage]{.underline}** **[and lead]{.underline}** global
coordination of the health system and other multilateral
**[institutions]{.underline}**." **[That [comes with]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** **[[broader acceptance of]{.mark} greater
[surveillance]{.mark} mechanisms as part of the public
good]{.underline}**, a faster recovery of East Asian countries with less
economic impact from COVID19, **[and a significant ramping up of
Chinese]{.underline}** foreign direct investment to burnish its
**[global reputation]{.underline}**. Still, the U.S. has a host of
incumbent advantages that could serve it well if it uses its economic
recovery to also strengthen its infrastructure, if it reverses runaway
unemployment quickly, if it can tame political polarization and, most
significantly, if it rediscovers its taste for collaborative global
leadership. In the economic race, no advantage is greater than the
dollar. China may be the world's second largest economy, but the Chinese
yuan [makes
up](https://asiatimes.com/2019/12/yuan-globalization-remains-a-long-way-off/)
only 2% of global payments and reserves while the dollar
[accounts](https://asiatimes.com/2019/12/yuan-globalization-remains-a-long-way-off/)
for roughly two thirds of foreign exchange reserves. The dollar
[underpins](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/04/16/the-dollars-dominance-masks-chinas-rise-in-finance)
four-fifths of global supply chains. The Economist
[reckons](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/04/16/the-dollars-dominance-masks-chinas-rise-in-finance)
China could chip away at U.S. economic advantages through three
underestimated strengths of its own: as a trusted debtor, an attractive
creditor, and increasingly as a tech partner. As a debtor, China's \$13
trillion bond market is the world's second largest and [has weathered
the crisis
well](https://www.ft.com/content/41044876-6ab4-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75).
Chinese debt
[returned](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-cuts-us-treasury-debt-holding-by-13/)
1.3% in the first quarter, vastly better than the 15.5%
[decline](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/04/16/the-dollars-dominance-masks-chinas-rise-in-finance)
for other emerging market bonds. Over the same period, the Chinese
market added \$8.5 billion (60 billion yuan) in net inflows. As a
creditor, China has remained willing and generous, an approach that
served the U.S. well after World War II. For example, it
[declared](https://www.ft.com/content/5f296d54-d29e-4e87-ae7d-95ca6c0598d5)
its willingness to back a G20 deal to suspend bilateral loan repayments
by poorer countries, a sizable benefit also at its own cost. On the tech
front, few countries were as ready as China for money and people to go
entirely online. Tencent and Ant Financial have more than a billion
users each for their digital wallets, and they are expanding rapidly
throughout Asia. OneConnect, an offshoot of China's largest insurer,
provides financial institutions in sixteen Asian countries with
cloud-based services. So, what other advantages can the United States
leverage in this race? Never underestimate the brittleness of an
authoritarian country under stress. Its broad censorship, it's opaque
legal system, and the nature of its surveillance state are hardly models
to emulate. Beyond that, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is not alone
[in
proposing](https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Xi-fears-Japan-led-manufacturing-exodus-from-China)
that his country relocate high-value supply chains from China. If many
countries do the same, the manufacturing foundation of China's economy
could erode. The Financial Times' Gideon Rachman
[adds](https://www.ft.com/content/2e8c8f76-7cbd-11ea-8fdb-7ec06edeef84)
that the global trust in the dollar is just one of two built-in U.S.
advantages that are difficult to dislodge. The other? "Where, outside
your home country, would you most like your children to go to university
or to work?" he writes. Most significant in this race would be if
**[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [regained]{.mark}]{.underline}**
its appetite for political and economic **[[leadership as
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** world's premier "[**[convening
power."]{.underline}**]{.mark} That need not be done at the cost of
China -- or anyone else. The race still can be won if U.S. leaders see
it as a marathon and recall that much of the world long embraced their
global leadership because partners learned they were more likely to win
as American partners. This economic rebound from COVID19 will be patchy
and uneven. **[[Being first out the gate will be significant]{.mark},
and that is likely to be China]{.underline}**. Yet history has taught
the United States that it's victory will be longest lasting if it can
achieved alongside partners and allies.

#### Nuclear war

**Henricksen 17**, emeritus senior fellow at the Hoover Institution
(Thomas, "Post-American World Order," *Hoover Institution*,
<http://www.hoover.org/research/post-american-world-order>)

The **[[tensions stoked by]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[assertive
regimes]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Kremlin or Tiananmen Square
**[[could spark]{.mark} a political or military incident that might set
off a chain reaction leading to a]{.underline}** **[[large-scale
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Historically, powerful rivalries nearly
always lead to at least skirmishes, if not a full-blown war. **[The
anomalous [Cold War]{.mark} era]{.underline}**
**[[spared]{.underline}]{.mark}** the United States and Soviet Russia a
direct conflict, largely from concerns that one would trigger a
**[[nuclear exchange destroying]{.underline}]{.mark}** both states and
much of **[[the world]{.mark}. Such a [repetition might reoccur]{.mark}
in the unfolding]{.underline}** three-cornered **[geopolitical
world]{.underline}**. It seems safe to acknowledge that an ascendant
China and a resurgent Russia will persist in their geo-strategic
ambitions. What Is To Be Done? The first marching order is to dodge any
kind of perpetual war of the sort that George Orwell outlined in "1984,"
which engulfed the three super states of Eastasia, Eurasia, and Oceania,
and made possible the totalitarian Big Brother regime. A long-running
Cold War-type confrontation would almost certainly take another form
than the one that ran from 1945 until the downfall of the Soviet Union.
What prescriptions can be offered in the face of the escalating
competition among the three global powers? First, **[[by staying
militarily and economically strong, the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[will]{.mark} have the resources to
[deter]{.mark} its peers' hawkish behavior that might otherwise
trigger]{.underline}** a **[[major conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Judging by the history of the Cold War, **[[the]{.mark} coming
[strategic chess match]{.mark} with Russia and China [will prove
tense]{.mark} and
demanding]{.underline}**---**[[since]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[all]{.mark} the [countries boast nuclear arms]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and long-range ballistic missiles. Next, **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[should widen and sustain willing coalitions
of partners]{.underline}**, something at which America excels, and at
which China and Russia fail conspicuously. **[[There can be
little]{.mark} room for [error]{.mark} in]{.underline}** fraught
**[crises [among nuclear]{.mark}-weaponized]{.underline}** and
**[[hostile powers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Short- and long-term
standoffs are likely, as they were during the Cold War. Thus, **[the
playbook]{.underline}**, in part, **[involves a waiting game in which
each power looks to its rivals to suffer]{.underline}** grievous
**[internal problems]{.underline}** which could entail a collapse, as
happened to the Soviet Union.

### I/L -- Inflation 🡪 Recession

#### U[nchecked inflation]{.underline}\-\--triggers a Deep recession

**Tully 11-3**-2021, citing William Luther, an economics professor at
Florida Atlantic University (Shawn, \"Th**[e Fed has two options on
inflation---and neither are pretty]{.underline}**\", *Fortune*,
<https://fortune.com/2021/11/03/fed-inflation-recession-forecast/>)

The two possible scenarios for inflation

**[[The longer market]{.mark} participant[s]{.mark} [view]{.mark} the
[big numbers arriving]{.mark} month after month, [the more they\'ll lose
faith]{.mark} that the Fed\'s committed to doing what\'s necessary to
conquer inflation. The Fed could quell the outbreak now by raising
rates]{.underline}** and otherwise modestly tightening its monetary
grip, notes William Luther, an economics professor at Florida Atlantic
University. But the central bank isn\'t moving. Although Fed-watchers
expect the central bank to hike rates twice next year, those actions
would simply mark the close of its super-stimulative stance, maintained
to counter the pandemic. So far, the Fed\'s shown no intention of taking
tough measures to slow jack rabbit prices. \"Instead, all companies and
consumers are witnessing is rising inflation when the CPI reports each
month, and the Fed saying nothing about fighting it,\" says Luther.
\"**[If prices keep increasing at the current clip, [producers
will]{.mark} start [bak]{.mark}ing [expectations of]{.mark} higher
[inflation in]{.mark}to their wage and procurement
contracts]{.underline}**.\" **[Those [locked-in escalators]{.mark} will
[give the hot streak legs]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[If]{.mark} strong [inflation takes hold]{.mark},]{.underline}**
Luther predicts, **[[the Fed will face two options, both bad]{.mark} for
the economy]{.underline}** and stocks. \"**[[The]{.mark} first is that
the [Fed]{.mark} \'sticks to its guns\' by pledging to wrestle the price
trend back to 2%, and because it\'s waited so long, [must radically
contract]{.mark} [credit]{.mark} to get there]{.underline}**,\" say
Luther. **[[That]{.underline}]{.mark}** course **[[would cause a deep
recession]{.underline}]{.mark}**, pounding bonds and equities. **[[In
the second]{.mark} course, [the Fed would]{.mark} simply [accept]{.mark}
and perpetuate]{.underline}** the today\'s higher
**[[inflation]{.underline}]{.mark}** as a new normal. \"**[The
market]{.underline}** participants **[would be expecting 3% inflation,
and the Fed would meet those expectations]{.underline}** by delivering
3% inflation,\" says Luther. The appeal of taking that path: It would
avoid an immediate recession. \"The first \'stick to your guns\'
solution would be require such a steep downturn because the Fed delayed
getting tough for so long,\" says Luther. \"It might take the second
option because the harder something is to do, the the less likely the
Fed is to do it.\" **[Punting carries a cost.]{.underline}** **[The
central bank would be [scrapping its]{.mark} longstanding, [2%
goal]{.mark}, and adopting a new stance of tolerating high
inflation]{.underline}** to sidestep a recession. \"**[That [would
greatly increase uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}** for consumers,
producers and **[[investors]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" says Luther.
\"**[They[\'d]{.mark} [worry]{.mark} that [the Fed is no longer
credible]{.mark}, that [it]{.mark} could [let inflation get out of
control]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\"

#### Tolerating inflation [shatters]{.underline} growth

**Tully 11-3**-2021, citing William Luther, an economics professor at
Florida Atlantic University (Shawn, \"The Fed has two options on
inflation---and neither are pretty\", *Fortune*,
<https://fortune.com/2021/11/03/fed-inflation-recession-forecast/>)

Or, the Fed could take the low road and skirt the agony of a hard times.
But **[[embracing inflation]{.mark} of 3%-or-higher [creates its
own]{.mark} set of [problems. Suppliers would]{.mark} [avoid]{.mark}
long-term [contracts]{.mark} that provide their clients certainty on
their future input costs]{.underline}**. \"**[[Those]{.mark} suppliers
[would]{.mark}]{.underline}** stand to **[[lose money if they committed
to multi-year contracts]{.mark}, and inflation raised their costs a lot
more than they anticipated]{.underline}**,\" says Luther. The bigger
worry: **[[America would be]{.mark}come [a far riskier place to do
business]{.mark}]{.underline}**, chiefly **[because]{.underline}**
consumers, companies and [**[investors could no longer rely on the Fed
to keep purchasing power steady, a pillar of our economic
might]{.underline}**.]{.mark} More uncertainty raises the \"equity risk
premium,\" the extra investors are willing to pay for stocks over
super-safe Treasuries. A rising ERP means lower multiples, and lower
equity prices. \"**[[If the Fed permits higher
inflation]{.underline}]{.mark}** to avoid recession, **[we know that it
conducts policy not the way it promised]{.underline}**, but the way it
sees fit at the moment,\" says Luther. **[If the Fed\'s gone this far,
market participants will fret, [who knows if it will allow
inflation]{.mark} to race [even faster]{.mark}?]{.underline}**

### ! Populism 

#### Inflation [fuels populism]{.underline}.

**O'Sullivan 21**, Senior Contributor at Forbes (Mike, July 17th, "Is
Inflation A Boon for Populists?" *Forbes*,
<https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeosullivan/2021/07/17/is-inflation-a-boon-for-populists/?sh=49de49e93de7>,
Accessed 11-06-2021)

My hunch is that [**[inflation]{.underline}**
**[is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[about to become the latest populist
focus]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Recent data show that **[in the
US]{.underline}** and increasingly in Europe, **[inflation is awakening
after a long slumber]{.underline}**. Indeed, many professional
economists and investors have never experienced high inflation. In the
USA, some inflation measures and price components are the highest that
they have been since the 1980's. The consensus and official view on
rising inflation is that it is 'transitory' -- driven by a burst of
coronavirus recovery spending. The risk, across many fronts is that it
proves more enduring and thus can cause financial, economic and
political pain.

Inflation is transitory?

**[This is where [inflation becomes interesting to
populists]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- **[[anything that causes economic
pain]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and social discomfort [is populist
ammunition]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[there is plenty of
evidence to show that inflation is often the offshoot of populist
economic policies]{.underline}** as the economic history of Latin
America shows.

Inflation, if it is here to stay, will become a political issue in at
least three ways. The first is housing where the OECD's housing
affordability gauge has gone vertical (i.e. housing is extremely
unaffordable), easily surpassing the levels of 2008 (recall the housing
crisis). In some countries like Ireland there is a persistent and acute
housing crisis, the debate around which is becoming populist -- though
it should be said that there has been a broad failure to manage this
issue from a policy point of view.

Rising prices cause pain

The second way in which inflation becomes an issue is where rising real
living costs are not matched by wage rises (we may see this in about six
months' time as economic activity and policy normalizes) and 'the price
of things' becomes a topic of political debate and increasingly,
agitation. In the past, and particularly in emerging economies where
households spend a large amount of disposable income on food, price
rises can lead to unrest (i.e. the Arab Spring).

Third, rising inflation brings the prospect of rising interest rates
which will not only make life more complicated for mortgage holders but
will ignite a debate on indebtedness, its consequences and remedies.
Lurking behind this is the fact that central banks by declaring
inflation 'transitory' and not yet giving any sense that they are
worried about asset price inflation nor the consequences of asset
purchases, find themselves snookered. As we have seen with the tussles
between Donald Trump and Fed Chair Jay Powell, central banks make easy
targets for populists and can be forced into bad policy decisions by
them.

**[So, [inflation]{.mark} if and [when it materializes, may be]{.mark}
political [fodder for populists]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[and]{.mark}
if it does, [this will]{.mark} [complicate the policy]{.mark} and
political [outlook]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Populism is difficult to
counteract, and often the best remedy for it is the incompetence of
populists themselves. What might be the best solution for inflation -- I
propose that it is populism. As the study I mentioned earlier shows,
populists tend to depress growth, and therefore inflation.

#### Goes nuclear. 

**Russell 19**, citing T.V. Paul, James McGill professor of political
science. (Nina, 11/5/19, \"Experts discuss threats to the international
nuclear order\", *McGill Tribune*,

Experts convened to discuss threats to the global nuclear order on Nov.
1 at Thomson House. Hosted by McGill's Centre for Peace and
International Security Studies and moderated by Jennifer Welsh, Canada
150 Research Chair in Global Governance and Security at McGill,
panellists discussed the shift in global power after the end of the Cold
War.

T.V. **[[Paul]{.underline}]{.mark}**, James McGill professor of
political science, **[[emphasized the connection between global rising
populism and the]{.mark} increasing [acceptance of nuc]{.mark}lear
[weapon]{.mark} [use.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

"**[Tradition has to be learned and socialized, and the new generation
has to appreciate that this exists]{.underline}**," Paul said.
"Unfortunately, **[our political leaders]{.underline}**, including Mr.
Trump, **[don't give the impression that we've learned
much]{.underline}** from the past 70 years. The people who faced
Hiroshima and Nagasaki \[...\] are vanishing. And how can we teach our
younger generation, especially when **[[our
leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}** engage in cheap talk, and
\[**[[use]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] [**[this]{.underline}**
**[instrument]{.underline}** **[for electoral
purposes]{.underline}**]{.mark}?"

**[[The risk of populist leaders using nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} [present]{.mark} both [in]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[regional conflicts]{.mark}, such as rising hostility [between India
and Pakistan, as well as]{.mark} in global conflicts, like [between the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Thomas Countryman, former United States Assistant Secretary of State for
International Security and Nonproliferation, believes that the greatest
risk to the latter relationship is miscommunication.

### ! Rate Hikes

**[[The Fed could tighten too hard and fast in response to
inflation]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Pent-up demand from last year\'s lockdowns and ongoing supply chain
difficulties have led to inflation hitting its highest level in over a
decade. While price increases are in one way a sign of the recovery\'s
strength - American consumers are desperate to buy things - **[[moves to

**[The most famous]{.underline}** of those Fed-triggered recessions
**[was the \"Volcker Shock\"]{.underline}** of 1980, when then-Fed Chair
Paul Volcker raised rates to the historic highs seen in the above chart
to crush the stagflation of the late 1970s.

Elsewhere, as President Macron
[argued](https://www.ft.com/content/3ea8d790-7fd1-11ea-8fdb-7ec06edeef84)
**[this]{.underline}** week to the Financial Times, the coming months
**[[could determine]{.mark} [whether the E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion
[collapses]{.mark} as a political and economic project]{.underline}**.
The days ahead also **[[could]{.mark} [trigger]{.mark}]{.underline}** a
dangerous widening of the economic gap between emerging markets and the
developed world -- with **[[escalating conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and surging migration. It may seem premature to reflect on which of the
globe's economies is likely to have the most robust and lasting economic
comeback -- and with what geopolitical impact. After all, this was a
week in which the International Monetary Fund
[projected](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/04/14/weo-april-2020)
a 3% contraction in global GDP for 2020, the most dramatic drop since
the Great Depression. Yet it is the details behind that dismal forecast
that should raise concerns within the U.S. and Europe. **[Their
[steep]{.mark}er [economic decline and slow]{.mark}er [recovery could
lay the seeds for a long-lasting shift]{.mark} of global tectonic plates
[to China's advantage]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The IMF projected a U.S.
economic decline of about 6% in 2020 and a contraction of the eurozone
of 7.5%. That compares to projected Chinese economic growth for 2020 of
1.2% after a first quarter real decline of 6.7% -- far less than the
10%-plus dip many experts had expected. The only group of countries in
the world projected to be in positive territory are East Asian, at
roughly 1%. Even if one accepts that Chinese coronavirus fatalities
likely are greater than their public figures and that the growth decline
is likely larger, that doesn't change the potential for a scenario that
Deloitte and Salesforce this week [referred
to](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/covid-19/covid-19-scenarios-and-impacts-for-business-and-society-world-remade.html)
as "Sunrise in the East." Describing this scenario, as one of four
possibilities they list, they write, "**[The global center of power
shifts decisively east as [China]{.mark}]{.underline}** and other East
Asian nations **[take the reigns]{.underline}** as primary powers **[on
the world stage]{.underline}** **[and lead]{.underline}** global
coordination of the health system and other multilateral
**[institutions]{.underline}**." **[That [comes with]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** **[[broader acceptance of]{.mark} greater
[surveillance]{.mark} mechanisms as part of the public
good]{.underline}**, a faster recovery of East Asian countries with less
economic impact from COVID19, **[and a significant ramping up of
Chinese]{.underline}** foreign direct investment to burnish its
**[global reputation]{.underline}**. Still, the U.S. has a host of
incumbent advantages that could serve it well if it uses its economic
recovery to also strengthen its infrastructure, if it reverses runaway
unemployment quickly, if it can tame political polarization and, most
significantly, if it rediscovers its taste for collaborative global
leadership. In the economic race, no advantage is greater than the
dollar. China may be the world's second largest economy, but the Chinese
yuan [makes
up](https://asiatimes.com/2019/12/yuan-globalization-remains-a-long-way-off/)
only 2% of global payments and reserves while the dollar

[reckons](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/04/16/the-dollars-dominance-masks-chinas-rise-in-finance)
China could chip away at U.S. economic advantages through three
underestimated strengths of its own: as a trusted debtor, an attractive
creditor, and increasingly as a tech partner. As a debtor, China's \$13
trillion bond market is the world's second largest and [has weathered
the crisis
well](https://www.ft.com/content/41044876-6ab4-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75).
Chinese debt

1.3% in the first quarter, vastly better than the 15.5%
[decline](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/04/16/the-dollars-dominance-masks-chinas-rise-in-finance)
for other emerging market bonds. Over the same period, the Chinese
market added \$8.5 billion (60 billion yuan) in net inflows. As a
creditor, China has remained willing and generous, an approach that
served the U.S. well after World War II. For example, it
[declared](https://www.ft.com/content/5f296d54-d29e-4e87-ae7d-95ca6c0598d5)
its willingness to back a G20 deal to suspend bilateral loan repayments
by poorer countries, a sizable benefit also at its own cost. On the tech
front, few countries were as ready as China for money and people to go
entirely online. Tencent and Ant Financial have more than a billion
users each for their digital wallets, and they are expanding rapidly
throughout Asia. OneConnect, an offshoot of China's largest insurer,
provides financial institutions in sixteen Asian countries with
cloud-based services. So, what other advantages can the United States
leverage in this race? Never underestimate the brittleness of an
authoritarian country under stress. Its broad censorship, it's opaque
legal system, and the nature of its surveillance state are hardly models
to emulate. Beyond that, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is not alone
[in
proposing](https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Xi-fears-Japan-led-manufacturing-exodus-from-China)
that his country relocate high-value supply chains from China. If many
countries do the same, the manufacturing foundation of China's economy
could erode. The Financial Times' Gideon Rachman
[adds](https://www.ft.com/content/2e8c8f76-7cbd-11ea-8fdb-7ec06edeef84)
that the global trust in the dollar is just one of two built-in U.S.
advantages that are difficult to dislodge. The other? "Where, outside
your home country, would you most like your children to go to university
or to work?" he writes. Most significant in this race would be if
**[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [regained]{.mark}]{.underline}**
its appetite for political and economic **[[leadership as
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** world's premier "[**[convening
power."]{.underline}**]{.mark} That need not be done at the cost of
China -- or anyone else. The race still can be won if U.S. leaders see
it as a marathon and recall that much of the world long embraced their
global leadership because partners learned they were more likely to win
as American partners. This economic rebound from COVID19 will be patchy
and uneven. **[[Being first out the gate will be significant]{.mark},
and that is likely to be China]{.underline}**. Yet history has taught
the United States that it's victory will be longest lasting if it can
achieved alongside partners and allies.

#### Nuclear war

The **[[tensions stoked by]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[assertive
regimes]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Kremlin or Tiananmen Square
**[[could spark]{.mark} a political or military incident that might set
off a chain reaction leading to a]{.underline}** **[[large-scale
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Historically, powerful rivalries nearly
always lead to at least skirmishes, if not a full-blown war. **[The
anomalous [Cold War]{.mark} era]{.underline}**
**[[spared]{.underline}]{.mark}** the United States and Soviet Russia a
direct conflict, largely from concerns that one would trigger a
**[[nuclear exchange destroying]{.underline}]{.mark}** both states and
much of **[[the world]{.mark}. Such a [repetition might reoccur]{.mark}
in the unfolding]{.underline}** three-cornered **[geopolitical
world]{.underline}**. It seems safe to acknowledge that an ascendant
China and a resurgent Russia will persist in their geo-strategic
ambitions. What Is To Be Done? The first marching order is to dodge any
kind of perpetual war of the sort that George Orwell outlined in "1984,"
which engulfed the three super states of Eastasia, Eurasia, and Oceania,
and made possible the totalitarian Big Brother regime. A long-running
Cold War-type confrontation would almost certainly take another form
than the one that ran from 1945 until the downfall of the Soviet Union.
What prescriptions can be offered in the face of the escalating
competition among the three global powers? First, **[[by staying
militarily and economically strong, the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[will]{.mark} have the resources to
[deter]{.mark} its peers' hawkish behavior that might otherwise
trigger]{.underline}** a **[[major conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Judging by the history of the Cold War, **[[the]{.mark} coming
[strategic chess match]{.mark} with Russia and China [will prove
tense]{.mark} and demanding]{.underline}**---[**[since]{.underline}**
**[all]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [countries boast nuclear
arms]{.mark}]{.underline}** and long-range ballistic missiles. Next,
**[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[should widen
and sustain willing coalitions of partners]{.underline}**, something at
which America excels, and at which China and Russia fail conspicuously.
**[[There can be little]{.mark} room for [error]{.mark}
in]{.underline}** fraught **[crises [among
nuclear]{.mark}-weaponized]{.underline}** and **[[hostile
powers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Short- and long-term standoffs are
likely, as they were during the Cold War. Thus, **[the
playbook]{.underline}**, in part, **[involves a waiting game in which
each power looks to its rivals to suffer]{.underline}** grievous
**[internal problems]{.underline}** which could entail a collapse, as
happened to the Soviet Union.

### I/ L Hikes Bad

#### Rate-hiking is the [biggest risk]{.underline} to the economy

**Long 21**, economics correspondent. Before joining The Washington
Post, she was a senior economics reporter at CNN and a columnist and
deputy editor at the Patriot-News in Harrisburg, Pa. She also worked at
an investment firm in London (Heather, "The economy isn't going back to
February 2020. Fundamental shifts have occurred.," *Washington Post*,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/06/20/us-economy-changes/>)

Then there is **[[inflation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which hit a 13-year
high in May, and **[[is]{.mark} widely viewed as [the biggest risk that
could sink]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- or at least stall --- **[[the
recovery]{.mark}'s progress]{.underline}**. Although the Fed predicts
this will be a short-lived phenomenon, businesses and consumers are
already changing some behaviors. Many companies are shrinking the size
of how many paper towels are in a package or how much cat food is in a
can and still charging the same amount. Home builders are refusing to
guarantee prices in fear that material costs will jump further, and
investors are suddenly reviving interest in Treasury Inflation-Protected
Securities. "**[Because there are now so many retirees, I think [there
will be more political pressure to tame]{.mark} any
[inflation]{.mark}]{.underline}**," said Lisa Cook, an economics
professor at Michigan State University. "**[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}**
general **[[public has gotten used to low
inflation]{.underline}]{.mark}**." All of this is coming at a time when
workers are increasingly demanding more pay and better working
conditions. They want more flexibility, more opportunities for workers
of color and more understanding from employers of mental health and
child care needs. Businesses are paying attention, largely because they
are desperate for workers. There are an estimated 9.7 million job
openings right now, according to job site Indeed. That's a record, and
several million more than the nation has seen before. It's not a 'labor
shortage.' It's a great reassessment of work in America. How all of this
will play out remains uncertain. In housing, prices in many markets are
up 10 percent or more from a year ago, a very different dynamic than
what the nation experienced coming out of the Great Recession. Many of
the fastest growing prices are in smaller cities as Americans are
relocating to places with more green space and sense of community.
Advertisement A major concern is what happens now that so many
first-time home buyers are being priced out because they can't afford
the hefty down payments. They will have to stay as renters. Susan
Wachter, co-director of the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Institute
for Urban Research, predicts the nation is on the verge of a rental
housing crisis. At the end of this month, the national eviction
moratorium expires, and many landlords are eager to bump up rent and
force out tenants who lost jobs in the crisis. At the same time,
investors have scooped up cheap single-family homes in the hopes of
renting them out for good profits. Single-family home rents were already
up 5.3 percent a year as of April, according to research firm CoreLogic.
"I see this coming year as a year where rents will increase by a
surprisingly high amount," Wachter said. "The affordability problem is
going to extend out into more places, especially second and third-tier
cities." Advertisement In a worst-case scenario, it could lead to more
homelessness, even in such a hot economy. It will almost certainly
reinforce the divides between the haves and have nots. \$1 million over
asking: D.C. bidding wars escalate as U.S. housing crunch intensifies
The same is true of the rise of automation during the pandemic. As
companies looked for ways to reduce the number of people in an office,
hotel or factory, they turned to robots and telework. They invested
heavily in technology, which economists predict could result in one of
the biggest boosts to worker productivity in years. This higher
productivity forecast is one of the reasons the McKinsey Global
Institute says the United States could see an economy that's \$3,500 per
person bigger by 2024. But those gains are unlikely to be evenly
distributed. Automation also has downsides, especially layoffs for
workers without college degrees. "This is not a sure thing that we reap
the benefits of faster growth without negative side effects. There are
real worries about inequality," said Susan Lund, head of the McKinsey
Global Institute. "Are we able to create real opportunities for people
who have been in low-wage, low skilled jobs?" Advertisement In addition
to equality and housing questions, policymakers are also grappling with
what will happen with inflation. The nation hasn't seen sustained high
inflation in 30 years. It's unclear how Americans will react. There is
perhaps no better illustration of the disruptive price and supply chain
issues than lumber prices, which hit an eye-popping record of \$1,670
per thousand board feet in May. There was a sigh of relief on Wall
Street and in the White House as lumber prices on the commodities
exchanges fell about \$600 in the past two weeks. The price is still
about three times higher than pre-pandemic norms, but it is trending
down. But home builder Jerry Konter in Savannah, Ga., says reality on
the ground is a lot different than charts on a Wall Street trading
terminal. Sky-high prices for lumber remain at stores and many suppliers
because they still have to sell all the wood they bought at the top.
Konter doesn't expect retail prices to change until August or September.
Advertisement For the first time in his 44-year career building homes,
Konter altered his standard contract to no longer guarantee a firm date
or price. He has to explain to buyers that the price could jump and
items like cabinets that used to arrive in 10 days now take four months.
While hopeful for improvement, he's preparing for high prices and supply
bottlenecks to last. His expectations --- and behaviors --- have
shifted. "I personally believe we are about to kill the golden goose in
the economy with these supply issues," Konter said, adding, "There are
so many people that are being left out of getting a home because of the
additional input costs. It's almost impossible to build an entry-level
home." While many economists and Wall Street traders believe the Fed's
prediction that inflation will subside later this year, they are quick
to say their biggest fear is that the Fed is wrong. **[[If]{.mark} a lot
of [people start believing inflation]{.mark} of 5 percent a year
[is]{.mark} [here to stay]{.mark}, then [they will demand higher pay and
businesses will]{.mark} respond by [rais]{.mark}ing consumer [prices
again, igniting a vicious cycle]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[The Fed
would]{.mark} have to [respond]{.mark} to that cycle [by hiking]{.mark}
interest [rates quickly]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[a tactic
that]{.mark} typically [causes recessions]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### Fast hikes [choke off]{.underline} the economy

**Bizouati**-Kennedy **21**, citing Jay Hatfield, founder and CEO of
Infrastructure Capital and portfolio manager of PFFA AND Jonathan Wiley,

7-1-2021, \"Consequences of an Unnecessary Interest Rate Hike\", Yahoo,
<https://www.yahoo.com/now/consequences-unnecessary-interest-rate-hike-183407629.html>)

Some observers are warning of the unnecessary consequences and issues
**[an earlier rate hike could]{.underline}** trigger, including
**[slow]{.underline}**ing **[down the economic recovery]{.underline}**
and putting pressure on home prices. Jay Hatfield, founder and CEO of
Infrastructure Capital and portfolio manager of PFFA, tells
GOBankingRates that **[[if the Fed surprises the market with]{.mark}
faster than expected]{.underline}** taper of quantitative easing, or
even **[[a rate hike]{.mark}, it could limit the economic recovery as
[the stock market would]{.mark} likely [decline]{.mark}]{.underline}**
10-**[[20%]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[with negative implications
for]{.underline}]{.mark}** financial conditions, **[[consumer spending
and]{.mark} business [investment]{.mark}]{.underline}**. "We do expect
inflation to continue to surprise to the upside, but the Fed's
abandonment of its rigid 2% inflation target and newfound focus on its
dual mandate, make a premature tightening unlikely," Hatfield adds. The
Fed indeed also significantly raised its inflation forecast, as
according to meeting participants' projections, the inflation forecast
is up 3.4% from 2.4% in March, based on Fed data. Jonathan Wiley, vice
president and head of investments at Arch Global Advisors, agrees,
telling GOBankingRates that **[[if the Fed]{.mark} [decides to
hike]{.mark} too [quickly, there is a risk of]{.mark} them [choking off
the rebounding economy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** "While there is clamoring
for interest rates to rise soon to stem off inflationary pressures, we
take the position that any price increases will only be transitory, as
there are base effects. Falling yields on the 10-year of late would
indicate as much. Further large, stimulative government expenditures
could possibly change our opinion. However, progress remains slow in
Washington. There is a delicate \[Nik\] Wallenda-like balancing act
taking place, **[[failing to signal properly can spook]{.mark} the
[markets]{.mark} as well]{.underline}**," he adds.

#### Rate hikes cause [short]{.underline}- AND [long]{.underline}-term downturn

**Guida 11-2**-2021, Economics Reporter @ Politico. (Victoria, \"The Fed
is ready to rein in its aid. Market tremors are already emerging.\",

For the Federal Reserve, this could be a year of living dangerously. The
central bank is expected to announce this week plans to begin
withdrawing its massive support for the economy, the first step in
winding down the historic cash infusions it launched to save markets
during the pandemic. **[What could come next --- interest rate hikes ---
is causing angst among]{.underline}** the Wall Street
**[investors]{.underline}** who finance the nation\'s debt and creating
potential peril for Democrats on the 2022 campaign trail.
Weaker-than-projected economic growth in the last quarter, a jobs
slowdown and supply chain snags that are likely to continue deep into
next year are all sending warning signs for President Joe Biden's
economy, despite an overall positive outlook that has sent the stock
market soaring. At the same time, top Fed officials are increasingly
voicing concern that inflation will stay higher for longer than they
expected. As a result, some on Wall Street are worried that **[[the Fed
might raise borrowing costs]{.mark} as early as the middle of next year
to fight price surges, [a move that could jeopardize the
recovery]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Political progressives have similar
concerns, but their focus is on ordinary Americans. "What problems would
an interest rate hike solve and what problems would an interest rate
hike create?" said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork
Collaborative, one of many progressive groups that have pressed the Fed
to keep rates low until full employment is reached. "How did the
American economy end up in a place where our supply chain is so shoddy
that we can't stock frozen pizza? When you think about that, the answer
is not related to monetary policy." The prospect of the central bank
raising interest rates during an election year could cause tremors in
the political world, with Democrats seeking to maintain their hair-thin
majorities in Congress. Biden's stewardship of the economy is a
make-or-break issue for voters, and GOP lawmakers have hammered away at
his big-spending policies as the driver of price surges. The White House
and many economists point to production and shipping delays as the main
culprit. The clearest sign of concern in the markets over the economy?
Rates on long-term U.S. debt recently dipped below those on some
shorter-term debt, a rare event known as a yield curve inversion that
shows expectations of slower growth and has been the harbinger of
recessions in the past. A slowing economy is not just an American
concern: Yield curves in the Euro-zone flattened last week after the
European Central Bank confirmed expectations for rate increases
beginning next year. **[[Markets aren't predicting a downturn
yet]{.underline}]{.mark}**, said Roberto Perli, founding partner of
research firm Cornerstone Macro and a former Fed economist.
**[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}** they are saying: "**[By [tightening
\[credit\] prematurely]{.mark}, the Fed [will compromise the
long-term]{.mark} [prospects for the]{.mark} U.S.
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**." In an interview Sunday with Bloomberg
News, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she wasn't worried about the
movement in Treasury yields: "No, not me. I think what we're going to
see is a good, solid recovery. The unemployment rate has gone down
considerably, and this is nothing like the recovery from the 2008
financial crisis." Fed policymakers begin two days of meetings today,
after which they're expected to announce plans to start pulling back the
\$120 billion in monthly bond purchases the central bank has carried out
since the pandemic began, a move that was designed to depress interest
rates. Fed officials have said that once that is completed, likely by
mid-2022, they may begin a new cycle of raising rates That means the
next year will be a delicate dance for **[the central
bank]{.underline}**, which **[hasn't sent a definite signal yet whether
rate hikes are likely]{.underline}**, and the immediate challenge facing
either Fed Chair Jerome Powell, if he is reappointed, or his successor.
**[[If the Fed moves]{.mark} too [quickly to rein in]{.mark} consumer
and business [spending to cool inflation, it would]{.mark} be
[damag]{.mark}ing to [longer-term growth and job
creation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[If the central bank waits too long,
[it would]{.mark} have to [act]{.mark} more [aggressively to raise
borrowing costs]{.mark} down the road, [which could]{.mark} also
[trigger a recession]{.mark}]{.underline}**. "It's a no-win situation
the Fed has been put in," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the
American Action Forum and the former head of the Congressional Budget
Office.

### I/L Hikes Bad -- Emerging Economies

#### Rate hikes [devastate]{.underline} emerging economies

**[[Rising U.S. interest rates are]{.underline}]{.mark}** often thought

[crises]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Indeed, as shown in Figure 1 below, the
rise in the federal funds rate (the black line) during the Volcker
disinflation of the early 1980s was associated with a sharp rise in the
incidence of financial crises in EMEs (the green bars). However, on
other occasions, such as in the mid-2000s, EMEs weathered rising U.S.
rates with few difficulties.

What accounts for differences in the so-called \"spillovers\" of U.S.
monetary policy to emerging markets? **[Our recent research shows that
[financial spillovers]{.mark} to EMEs of U.S. monetary policy [depend
on]{.mark} two key factors]{.underline}**.2 **[The first of these is the
reason for the change in [U.S. interest rates]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A
rise in interest rates driven by favorable growth prospects is likely to
have relatively benign effects on emerging financial markets, since the
benefits of higher U.S. GDP through increased import demand from its
trading partners and increased investor confidence should mute the costs
of higher rates. Conversely, **[[if]{.mark} higher [rates are
driven]{.mark} [mainly by worries about inflation]{.mark} or a hawkish
turn in Fed policy, which we jointly describe as monetary news, [this
will likely be]{.mark}]{.underline}** more **[[disruptive]{.mark} for
emerging markets]{.underline}**. The second key factor influencing the
spillovers from U.S. monetary policy is the domestic conditions in the
EMEs themselves; **[financial conditions in economies with higher
macroeconomic vulnerabilities tend to be more sensitive to a given rise
in U.S. interest rates.]{.underline}**

### AT Hikes Solve

Surveys suggest higher inflation is now consumers' biggest concern. It
is also politically risky for President Biden, who this week said the
Federal Reserve should deal with it. But **[[the Fed's
tools]{.underline}]{.mark}**, namely higher interest rates, **[[work by
cooling demand]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[They are useless when the
problem is restricted supply]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In fact,
**[[raising rates in the face of a supply shock could aggravate the
economic damage and]{.mark} perversely make future [inflation too
low]{.mark},]{.underline}** as the European Central Bank discovered when
it did just that in 2008 because of higher oil prices.

However, **[Robert Daly, director of the Wilson Center's Kissinger

consumers]{.underline}** and relieve them of the burden of bearing a
higher cost of living. "If he simply unilaterally lifted those tariffs
without getting anything from China, he would get a lot of pressure from
Republicans, especially in the Senate, who would call him soft on
China," Daly said. Like Daly, **[Capital Economics' Williams was also

### Won't Pass

#### Won't pass -- not enough time and Manchin and Sinema are far from onboard

**Becker 6-21**-22 \[Bernie Becker is a tax reporter for POLITICO Pro,
\"Another week, another BBB update\", POLITICO,
https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-tax/2022/06/21/another-week-another-bbb-update-00040903\]
GBS-HW

It hasn't been a fast-moving process. But Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer haven't stopped talking about a
slighter version of the Build Back Better agenda that Democrats were
pushing last year. Manchin and Schumer met twice last week on a
potential measure to raise taxes on the rich and corporations, and enact
new climate and prescription drug provisions, as our Burgess Everett
reported. **[Democrats also are sounding increasingly confident that a
deal can be reached at some point before Congress breaks for the August
recess. But as with everything BBB-related, it's probably not wise to
make any grand assumptions yet about whether Democrats will or won't be
able to work something out in the end.]{.underline}** This much is
clear, though --- **[Democrats still have plenty of hurdles to clear
before a slimmer BBB might make it to President Joe Biden's
desk.]{.underline}** ABOUT THOSE HURDLES: **[The first obstacle for
Democrats is pretty clear --- finding a deal that Manchin will sign off
on.]{.underline}** **[But there's a related issue there for Democrats,
too: Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) hasn't taken part in these
Manchin-Schumer talks]{.underline}**, by design --- though she's also
quite busy with the gun control talks. **[Still, Sinema's opposition to
tax rate increases led Democrats to something of a grab bag of revenue
raisers for the first BBB, so she'll still have to bless whatever (if
anything) might come out of the current discussions. And then there's
the calendar: Congress has a two-week recess after it completes its work
for this week.]{.underline}** Once lawmakers return, the House is only
scheduled to be in session for three more weeks before it heads out for
August recess. (The Senate has a fourth week on the books.) **[So
Democrats don't have a ton of time for this deal to come together,
though Schumer and his team are already starting to bounce potential
ideas off the Senate parliamentarian.]{.underline}** To put that another
way: Basically everyone acknowledges that the current talks between
Schumer and Manchin are real. **[But some people closely watching the
situation wonder if the discussions are moving quickly enough given that
July is right around the corner.]{.underline}** One final point:
Everyone that Weekly Tax reached out to on Monday thought that a
BBB-light bill wouldn't die in the House, if it makes it through the
Senate. There's a variety of reasons for that. But perhaps first and
foremost: People have a hard time imagining that a big bill like this
would go down on Speaker Nancy Pelosi's watch, especially as questions
still swirl about how long she'll stay as House Democratic leader.

Jeremy, EE News Reporter, "Reconciliation redux? Pelosi, Schumer huddle
with Biden," June 16, 2022

https://www.eenews.net/articles/reconciliation-redux-pelosi-schumer-huddle-with-biden/dmr

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi (D-Calif.) huddled with President Joe Biden yesterday afternoon
to discuss a host of issues related to inflation that sound a lot like
the contours of a potential reconciliation package. "They discussed
their plans for fighting the global problem of inflation that is
affecting every major economy, such as bringing down prescription drug
and energy costs, and adding to the historic deficit reduction we have
accomplished," the White House said in a readout of the meeting.
Prescription drugs, clean energy and deficit reduction have emerged as
central tenets in the new reconciliation push underway by Senate
Democrats to attract the support of Sen. Joe **[Manchin]{.underline}**
(D-W.Va.), whose opposition **[killed]{.underline}** the House-passed,
\$1.7 trillion **["Build Back Better Act" late last year.]{.underline}**
The White House readout did not specifically say the meeting was about
reconciliation. **[Dem]{.underline}**ocrat**[s in]{.underline}** **[both
chambers are working to advance legislation to address high costs in
food and energy]{.underline}**, though **[there is slim chance those
measures pass the Senate]{.underline}**. **[Manchin]{.underline}** and
his staff met with Schumer on Tuesday in the latest talks between the
two lawmakers. Both **[declined comment following the
meeting]{.underline}**. Manchin has suggested he would support a package
that would bring down the costs of prescription drugs while also
unleashing a host of clean energy tax credits seen as critical to
decarbonizing the electric sector. Those provisions must be accompanied
by deficit reduction provisions, Manchin has insisted.
**[Dem]{.underline}**ocrat**[s]{.underline}** **[had hoped to resurrect
a deal on reconciliation by the Memorial Day recess, but the holiday
passed without major action. A lengthy August recess looms over the
congressional calendar]{.underline}**.

### No PC -- Gas Tax Thumper

The White House on Wednesday again blamed Russia's war in Ukraine for
recent hikes in fuel prices, as President Joe **[Biden pushed for
Congress to suspend the federal gas tax]{.underline}**. Both Biden and
Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm acknowledged on Wednesday that a gas
tax holiday wouldn't be enough on its own to counteract the forces
raising gas prices, but framed it as an important step in a continuing
process to help American consumers as oil supplies are constrained. "We
could have turned a blind eye to Putin's murderous ways," Biden said in
a short speech at the White House, referring to President Vladimir Putin
of Russia. "The price of gas wouldn't have spiked the way it has. I
believe that would have been wrong." The president contrasted the
bipartisan support for Ukraine with criticism of his administration on
rising gas prices. His administration has faced mounting disapproval for
near-record levels of inflation. "Are you saying that we would rather
have lower gas prices in America and Putin's iron fist in Europe?" Biden
said. "I don't believe that." Biden asked oil companies to increase
refining capacity and pass "every penny" of their savings from the
proposed gas tax holiday on to consumers. Earlier Wednesday he called
for a three-month suspension of the 18-cent-per-gallon federal gas tax,
but **[it seems unlikely to pass in Congress]{.underline}**. **[The
conversation between the administration and both Democrats and
Republicans is ongoing, Granholm said.]{.underline}** "I would hope that
both sides of the aisle are listening to their constituents about
getting relief," she said at the daily White House press briefing.

While both those presidents recovered to win second terms, it is far
from clear whether Biden is able to engineer a similar comeback. **[[He

**[[has been eclipsed by]{.mark} rising [inflation]{.mark}. Consumer

**[[unhappiness]{.mark} in the country [is even broader than

interest rates much more aggressively]{.underline}** than expected in
the coming months to limit price gains. Such a heavy-handed tightening
could lead to a slowdown in growth and in the labour market, with the
odds of a recession over the next two years rising sharply. Unlike
Trump, who repeatedly singled out Powell for criticism,
**[Biden]{.underline}** has **[pledged to respect the Fed's
independence]{.underline}** as it decides the best way to tackle
inflation. But **[that means he won't be able to control or direct much

be aware of the list of presidents who failed to be re-elected due to
economic malaise, from Jimmy Carter in 1980 to George HW Bush in 1992.
"**[[It's a question of]{.mark} conditions and [how people are feeling

strategist and professor of politics at USC. "If you have a big
recession next year, and we're not out of it by 2024, \[Biden\] could
find himself in the same position as Bush in 1992," he adds. **[On top

At the Beverly Hills home of media mogul Haim Saban earlier this month,
[Joe Biden painted a [**grim picture** for]{.mark}]{.underline} a group
of Democratic donors to illustrate [the [political battles]{.mark} that
lie [ahead]{.mark}]{.underline} for the party. The US president said it
was essential to protect against a Republican party dominated by Donald
Trump's Make America Great Again movement, which is gearing up for a
fight in November's midterm elections --- and to try to take back the
White House in 2024. "Here's the deal, guys: what you're doing here
really, really matters. We cannot afford to let this MAGA Republican
party win. We can't." "The rest of the world is looking to us," Biden
continued. "There really is \[a question of\] 'What happens if the US
goes back to a Trumpian government?' It is a gigantic, gigantic
setback." The warning was intended to mobilise donor support for
Democrats up and down the ballot ahead of the midterms, when significant
defeats are expected, including the probable loss of control of the
House of Representatives and a possible move to minority status in the
Senate. But it also reflected a more disturbing reality for the
79-year-old [[president]{.underline}]{.mark}: in the space of just 17

what has become an all-out economic war with Putin. "The idea that we're

trains going in with American pilots and American crews --- just

Biden administration this week killed a plan to transfer Poland\'s MiG

and vowing to take matters into their own hands. "I think there's a

in an interview. "I just think that is a reflection of where the

**[[Slow-walking will]{.mark} absolutely [be the Republican
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, on both appointments and legislation.
They won't come out and say they're going to stonewall every appointee
and refuse to allow any legislation to pass; instead they'll say that
they just want to make sure Biden doesn't stock his administration with
radical leftists and propose far-out socialist laws. Send us the
nominees and the bills, and we'll consider them. It'll just take some
time. **[Weeks will then stretch into months, and the Biden agenda will
languish]{.underline}**. **[[They've done it

A]{.underline}]{.mark}**ffordable **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**are
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**ct by claiming they might support it --- and
they'll do it again. That's the Republican plan. The first step to
getting around it is to understand that the public won't blame gridlock
on the ones who are causing it. They'll just see a bunch of bickering in
Washington with nothing getting done, and **[Biden will be the one who
takes the blame]{.underline}**. Once you realize that the public is
neither aware of nor particularly concerned about process questions, you
can stop worrying about whether **[Republicans will
squawk]{.underline}** at this appointment or that executive order ---
because they'll squawk **[no matter what you do]{.underline}**. If it's
a good idea and you think the results will be good, then just do it. As
quickly and comprehensively as possible. As David Roberts of Vox
observes: In 2009, **[Obama and his aides made the mistake of
thinking]{.underline}** that their **[major initiatives had to be rolled
out one at a time in sequence]{.underline}**, **[because he had a finite
store of "political capital" that had to be spent
carefully]{.underline}**. **[But [p]{.mark}olitical [c]{.mark}apital [is
not something that exists apart from any]{.mark} particular
[issue]{.mark}]{.underline}**; **[[it isn't]{.mark} a special sauce that
has to be [poured on a policy]{.mark} in order [to make it
palatable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[And [with the parties]{.mark} as
[polarized]{.mark} and unified as they are, [p]{.mark}olitical
[c]{.mark}apital [has become]{.mark}]{.underline}** all but
**[[meaningless]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[There may have been a time
when a popular president possessed so much capital that a senator from
the opposition party would feel compelled to support him]{.underline}**
on part of that president's agenda, **[but that time is long
gone]{.underline}**. **[There is no account Biden can draw on to turn
Republican "no" votes into "yes."]{.underline}** So setting up a series
of high-profile policy battles may be the opposite of what Biden should
do. The unfortunate fact is that he may not have the opportunity to do
much in the way of big legislation on health care or climate change or
anything else, and if he has only executive power to work with, it makes
it all the more urgent to move quickly. Which means getting staff in
place immediately and then unleashing them. The Revolving Door Project
argues that Biden should give as much authority as possible to the
agencies to let them dismantle their particular corners of the Trump
legacy on their own, because the task "simply will not happen if
approached sequentially or micromanaged" by a White House staff with
limited bandwidth. **[That means moving on every policy area all at
once. [There's nothing to be gained by putting off]{.mark} any part of
[Biden's agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Whatever he can
do]{.underline}]{.mark}** given the limits of his power, **[[he should
do]{.mark} as soon as possible, [in a flood of
policymaking]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Even if Democrats win both Georgia
races and control the Senate, Biden should acknowledge that he likely
has two years until the 2022 midterm elections to pass whatever
legislation he can. Not only will Democrats probably lose one or both
houses in the inevitable backlash (as happens to most presidents in
their first midterm), the only possible chance at forestalling that
result is to get results, as many as possible, that he can show the
voters. Republicans will complain that Biden is being partisan,
uncompromising, taking a "my way or the highway" approach. It will be a
strategy to convince everyone of the lie that Biden and Democrats might
be able to find some way of winning them over, when in fact they'll be
implementing a strategy of total opposition. If Biden follows them on
that fruitless quest, he'll be running in circles while crucial time
passes and nothing gets done. **[The only option for him is to decide
not to care about Republican whining and do what he got elected to do
with all haste. The alternative is failure]{.underline}**.

version of the legislation 93-6. This came after a staggering six
extensions due to bickering and disagreement. Then, **[Congress approved

abuse]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The House okayed the package 393-8. The
Senate adopted the measure 98-1. And, there was no government shutdown.
The House and Senate came to terms on two bipartisan bills which funded
five of the 12 annual spending bills which operate the government. The
sides agreed to latch an additional measure to one of the spending plans
to fund the remaining seven areas of federal spending through December
7. President Trump briefly threatened to force a government shutdown if
lawmakers didn't include money for his border wall in the plan. But the
President ultimately punted that battle until December. **[Democrats

breath]{.underline}]{.mark}**, McConnell derided boisterous,
anti-Kavanaugh protesters outside the Capitol as a "mob." McConnell
insisted this week he needed the Senate to clear a slate of 15
conservative judges to lower courts before he could cut senators loose
for the midterm elections. McConnell and Schumer appeared at
loggerheads. McConnell's goal was clear: extract the confirmation of
these nominees -- or tether to Washington vulnerable Democratic senators
from battleground states to keep them off the campaign trail. Schumer
knew McConnell would ultimately prevail on the nominees after the
midterms. So the New York Democrat accepted McConnell's ransom,
permitting the Senate vote on a slate of nominees on Thursday night.
**[Schumer also extracted a concession from McConnell]{.underline}**:
send senators home until November 13th. One may wonder how **[[lawmakers
can find themselves in an imbroglio]{.mark} [over a major

### Winners Win

#### Winner's win\-\--spending PC rebuilds it

**Kane 7-24**-2021, The Washington Post\'s senior congressional
correspondent and columnist (Paul, "Day-to-day, Biden's agenda looks
rocky. But congressional Democrats say things are far rosier if you take
the long view.," *Washington Post*,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/biden-agenda-democrats-congress/2021/07/24/83b776be-ebc0-11eb-ba5d-55d3b5ffcaf1_story.html)

**[There is]{.underline}**, **[so far]{.underline}** at least, **[little
fear that Democrats are spreading themselves too thin]{.underline}** by
eschewing the traditional practice of focusing on a handful of domestic
policy issues in the first two years of an administration. "**[Political
momentum and political capital is like a muscle]{.underline}**. **[The
more you exercise it, the more of it you have]{.underline}**. **[It is
not like a finite resource that you can run out of if you spend too much
of it. What happens is that if we do a lot of positive
things]{.underline}**, then **[we've got more political clout to do even
more positive things]{.underline}**," Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said.
But there is an undercurrent of fear that Democrats lost focus on
battling the pandemic and that those gains might be forgotten if current
trend lines prompt new shutdowns. "We've done a good job over the last
several months. But **[we're going to have to]{.underline}** continue to
**[do it with aggressiveness]{.underline}** and precision because the
other side has no interest in governing and is going to spend all their
time trying to mischaracterize public policy wins," Rep. Hakeem Jeffries
(D-N.Y.), who is in charge of messaging in Pelosi's leadership team,
said. Some worry that the Biden administration needs to stay focused on
promoting the \$1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, fearful of mistakes
similar to 12 years ago, when the Obama administration neglected to
promote its roughly \$800 billion economic recovery bill after it passed
a month into office. "I don't think they've gotten enough credit for the
extraordinary logistical and managerial effort to manage the rollout of
the vaccine. That was a big task. And I think it was managed
effectively. And I think that's maybe the most important thing and the
least discussed," Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said. In late 2010, while he
was still a college professor, King wrote an essay, "The Democrats Beat
Themselves," citing how poorly the Obama administration sold the
economic recovery. "Basically, the President was subjected to a
two-year, nonstop 'Swift Boating' and never really fought back," King
wrote after the 2010 political bloodbath for Democrats. So, yes, on
Tuesday, federal health officials reported more than 62,000 new cases of
the deadly virus as 314 Americans died of the virus. A day earlier, the
stock market tumbled more than 700 points amid fears of the health
crisis causing another economic shock. But exactly six months earlier
--- Jan. 20, the day Biden was sworn in under strict social distancing
and masking guidelines outside the Capitol --- there were more than
185,000 new virus cases and a rolling weekly average of almost 200,000,
with 4,440 deaths caused by covid-19 that day. On Jan. 20, the Dow Jones
industrial average stood at 31,188, far below the closing of 34,512 six
months later. Labor Department reports this month showed strong wage
growth amid steady job growth that suggests sometime next year, the
economy will recover all the lost jobs from the pandemic. In June and
most of July, Biden tried to move past the pandemic and focused his
attention on the bipartisan infrastructure plan and the proposed \$3.5
trillion budget plan that is favored by liberals. Those two packages are
filled with campaign pledges to remake government support for the middle
class, the most ambitious budgets since the Great Society proposals of
the 1960s. Democrats will need to make Congress spend a lot more time in
Washington if they want to get Biden's agenda passed Democrats defend
these proposals as worthy of the big moment the nation faces. "We are
confronting a multitude of crises, including a once-in-a-century
covid-19 pandemic, a democracy crisis, a racial justice crisis and a
climate crisis all at the same time," Jeffries said. **[Schatz views the
old presidential model of focusing on a couple big things as
outdated]{.underline}**. "**[The model from the '80s was if you do too
many things, people are going to get freaked out. And I think the danger
here is not doing enough rather than doing too much]{.underline}**," he
said.

to "allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of
human judgment over the use of force."]{.underline}** **["Human judgment
over the use of force" does not require manual human "control" of the
weapon system, as is often reported, but instead requires broader human
involvement in decisions about how, when, where, and why the weapon will
be employed.]{.underline}** In addition, DODD 3000.09 requires that the
software and hardware of all systems, including lethal autonomous
weapons, be tested and evaluated to ensure they \[f\]unction as
anticipated in realistic operational environments against adaptive
adversaries; complete engagements in a timeframe consistent with
commander and operator intentions and, if unable to do so, terminate
engagements or seek additional human operator input before continuing
the engagement; and are sufficiently robust to minimize failures that
could lead to unintended engagements or to loss of control of the system
to unauthorized parties. **[Any changes to a system's operating
state---for example, due to machine learning---would require the system
to be retested and reevaluated to ensure that it has retained its safety
features and ability to operate as intended.]{.underline}** In addition
to the standard weapons review process, LAWS must undergo a secondary
senior-level review by the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and either the Under Secretary of
Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment or the Under Secretary of
Defense for Research and Engineering prior to both development and

**[Democratic drug-pricing measures]{.underline}** passed by the House
may **[steer more venture-capital funding to biological
medicines]{.underline}**, a field already drawing significant investor
attention, some investors and analysts said. The roughly \$2 trillion
social-spending and climate bill, approved in November, enables Medicare
to negotiate prices of certain older drugs it covers and introduces
other measures to curb prescription-medication costs. **[Biological
drugs,]{.underline}** such as protein and antibody treatments, would
**[be subject to Medicare negotiation 13 years after their market
launch]{.underline}**. Small-molecule drugs, chemical compounds
typically taken as pills, would face Medicare negotiation after nine
years. Companies refusing to negotiate would face a 95% excise tax on
the sales of the drug. Medicare negotiations wouldn't begin until 2025,
and would be limited to 10 drugs initially, with the number increasing
each year thereafter, rising to 100 by 2030. Negotiations would be
restricted to the top-selling medicines in Medicare that have no generic
competition. The bill also would cap annual drug-price increases at the
rate of inflation. The Senate plans to consider the bill this month.

President Joe **[Biden today asked Congress to give big budget increases
to most civilian science agencies.]{.underline}** But **[military
research would take a cut]{.underline}** under his administration\'s
first spending request to Congress, which lawmakers are certain to
revise. The \$6 trillion request calls for sweeping investments in
infrastructure and social welfare programs in the 2022 fiscal year that
begins 1 October. It also includes a 9% increase, or **[\$13.5 billion,
in total federal spending on R&D]{.underline}**, bringing the total to
\$171 billion. Spending on basic research would rise by 10%, or \$4.4
billion, to \$47.4 billion, whereas **[applied research would get a 14%
bump]{.underline}** (\$6.3 billion) to \$51.1 billion. The budget
\"**[proposes historic increases in funding for foundational R&D across
a range of scientific agencies]{.underline}**,\" Biden said in a
statement, including what he asserts is \"the biggest increase in
non-defense research and development spending on record.\" But not all
agencies would see their research budgets rise under the plan. One big
loser is the **[Department of Defense, which would see its basic
research spending shrink by 11%]{.underline}**, to \$2.3 billion, and
its applied science budget drop by 16%, to \$5.6 billion. In contrast,
Biden wants to more than double basic research spending at the
Department of the Interior, to \$171 million, and **[ramp up fundamental

**[Congress has a new rising target when it comes to cyber: The
Pentagon]{.underline}**. The U.S. military last year was given the green
light to start offensive cyber operations against foreign adversaries,
an area that one new Democratic subcommittee chair says he will keep a
close eye on in the coming months. But recent internal reports have
pointed to a **[lack of basic cybersecurity measures within the
Department of Defense (DOD) itself]{.underline}**, with one DOD report
last week finding that the military is "at risk from adversarial cyber
operations." And lawmakers have indicated that they will **[use this
upcoming Congress to look at the Pentagon's cyber preparedness, both in
terms of carrying out and fending off cyberattacks]{.underline}**.
Rep. [Jim Langevin ](https://thehill.com/people/jim-langevin/)(D-R.I.),
the chair of the House Armed Services Committee's intelligence
subcommittee, which oversees cybersecurity for the Pentagon, said he is
particularly **[concerned about the offensive cyberattacks that the U.S.
could carry out]{.underline}**. He said that in the past, the U.S may
have been too cautious in conducting cyber operations. But he warned
against officials going too far and fast in exercising their newly found
authorities and said that he plans to hold hearings on the topic.
"Cyberspace, in some ways, it's already a Wild West. We don't want to
make it worse," Langevin said. "**[Wherever possible, we should working
with our allies and friends in this space as we carry out the
strategies]{.underline}** --- it's **[important to have a whole of
government approach]{.underline}**." The Democrat, who also co-founded
the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, said that not all retaliation to
a cyberattack has to actually take place in cyberspace. The U.S. will
often deliver indictments or sanctions as a penalty for cyber acts,
although that was largely before the military was given more power for
offensive cyber actions. The Senate has wasted little time in
questioning military leaders over their cybersecurity measures, grilling
them about their preparedness at a hearing last week. Sen. [Mike
Rounds ](https://thehill.com/people/mike-rounds/)(R-S.D.), the chairman
of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, said last
week's hearing on Pentagon cybersecurity is one of several his panel
will have in the coming months. **["What we're looking at is how do we
get to whole of nation or whole of country when we talk about
cybersecurity protections]{.underline}**, and that means you have to
have input from both the private and the government sector," he said
this week. "Each is separate, **[but they're got to
coordinate]{.underline}**."

of filling potholes on the streets and have recognized that our "digital
potholes" demand equal attention. While there's no silver bullet, we
can't ignore the economics. Better cybersecurity outcomes demand more
dedicated cybersecurity investment. History has taught us that investing
in cyber resilience before something bad happens will almost always be
cheaper in the long run. That's why Palo Alto Networks was encouraged to
see a State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program included as a key
provision in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The funds
provided from this grant program will be cybersecurity game changers for
jurisdictions all across the country. Similarly, the cybersecurity plans
required to unlock those funds will **[promote a broad culture of
cybersecurity vigilance that benefits us all]{.underline}**. The
multi-entity grant eligibility will **[promote innovative
investments]{.underline}**, such as security operations centers that
span state lines. Properly resourcing the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) will act as a force multiplier to
ensure that investment in cybersecurity resilience is met with technical
assistance and services to help organizations with capacity building.
**[Both the House and Senate continue showing eagerness to
fund]{.underline}** CISA's necessary maturation. Investing in
cybersecurity resilience will be foundational in gaining the upper hand
on the ransomware epidemic. The White House has demonstrated **[strong
leadership both domestically and internationally]{.underline}** on this
issue. That focus, coupled with dedicated funding, can meaningfully move
the needle.

[Throughout the 117th Congress, there continues to be **strong
bipartisan, bicameral momentum** to coalesce around key cybersecurity
initiatives. This has been all the more enhanced by the Biden
Administration's prioritization of this issue.]{.underline} Especially
in an increasingly tense and partisan atmosphere, where policymakers
will continue to diverge from bipartisan agreements with an election on
the horizon, [cybersecurity issues will continue to be a strong
opportunity for lawmakers to facilitate real impact through efforts that
cross party lines.]{.underline}

[Thus far in the 117th Congress, cybersecurity policies and funding have
**garnered attention in nearly every major funding package.** This
includes large funding infusions within the 2021 American Rescue Plan,
the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the FY 2022 omnibus
package.]{.underline} Beyond inclusion in these broader packages, there
has [also been significant traction to move smaller, less controversial
bills that can quickly move through the legislative process, which has
been supplemented by **strong advocacy efforts from influential
cybersecurity leaders on both sides of the aisle**]{.underline}.

Over the next few months when very little policy will get done due to
the upcoming elections, [cybersecurity policy **remains one of the few
areas where policy changes could occur**]{.underline} -- ranging from
large funding opportunities to policy implications concerning
jurisdiction of federal cybersecurity programs, and more[. Cybersecurity
remains well-positioned to receive strong attention over the next

That has changed. In August 2018, President Trump rescinded PPD-20 and

recommendations to address the crisis, including creating a "national

misinformation across the executive branch, investing in local
journalism, diversifying social media platform workforces and investing
in civic education.  "At the time of this writing, the **[Federal

**[WASHINGTON --- President Biden's high-stakes speech in Warsaw on
Saturday was crafted with the intent of throwing the full weight of the
United States behind its European allies, while framing the Russian
invasion of Ukraine as part of a global "battle between democracy and
autocracy." And although the forceful denunciation of President Vladimir
V. Putin's war resonated with some leaders, it was an unprompted ad-lib
that captured the attention of foreign policy experts, members of
Congress and NATO allies.]{.underline}** "For God's sake, this man
cannot remain in power," Mr. Biden declared, a comment that two White
House officials said was not included in the president's prepared
speech. **[Even as top administration officials spent Sunday walking
back Mr. Biden's remarks, the statement had already sent ripple effects
throughout the world, highlighting just how powerful nine unprompted
words from the president can be, particularly during a foreign policy
crisis.]{.underline}** "I wouldn't use this kind of words," President
Emmanuel Macron of France said in a television interview on Sunday, when
asked to comment on Mr. Biden's speech. He said he hoped to obtain a
cease-fire and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine through
diplomacy. "If we want to do this, we mustn't escalate," he said,
"neither with words nor with actions." Mr. Biden spent most of the
speech summarizing the penalties his administration had imposed on
Russia and its efforts to support refugees, while asserting that even
though the United States would not send troops to Ukraine, it was
prepared to defend NATO allies. Mr. Biden raised his voice when he
warned Mr. Putin not to move "on one single inch" of NATO territory, a
message of support for allies that the administration had intended to be
one of the main takeaways from the address, according to officials.
Until Mr. Biden's unscripted moment, the speech had largely achieved its
intended goals, lawmakers, allies and foreign policy experts said. But
immediately afterward, Mr. Biden's aides worried that his surprising
remark might roil some of those allies the president was determined to
keep unified. The White House has tried to ensure that each step taken
against Russia is in line with European allies. Taken literally, the
remark meant the United States would be reversing a policy of not
pushing for regime change. Mr. Biden's staff felt as if it had little
choice but to play down the off-the-cuff comment. "We do not have a
strategy of regime change in Russia or anywhere else, for that matter,"
Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in Jerusalem after meeting
with Israel's foreign minister, Yair Lapid. "In this case, as in any
case, it's up to the people of the country in question. It's up to the
Russian people." Michal Baranowski, a senior fellow and director of the
Warsaw office of the German Marshall Fund who attended Mr. Biden's
speech, acknowledged that the president's comment could be perceived as
"a call for regime change." But he said it was unlikely to lead to
further escalation with Russia. **[But Republican members of Congress
worried that the Kremlin, which has issued propaganda claiming the
United States is determined to destroy Russia, would seize on the
remark. Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, described Mr. Biden's
speech as "very strong, despite the ad-lib at the end." The comment
"plays into the hands of Russian propagandists and plays into the hands
of Vladimir Putin," he said during an interview on NBC's "Meet the
Press."]{.underline}** Indeed, Moscow was quick to respond. On Saturday,
Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said that it was not for Mr. Biden
to decide who the Russian president should be. Vyacheslav Volodin, a
senior Russian lawmaker, wrote on Telegram that neither Boris N. Yeltsin
nor Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who led during the Cold War, was the target of
similar comments from American heads of state. **["The reason for this
behavior will be more professionally explained by psychiatrists," Mr.
Volodin said. "U.S. citizens should be ashamed of their president."
Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations
Committee, said Mr. Biden made a "horrendous gaffe" in an otherwise good
speech. "The administration has done everything they can to stop
escalating --- there's not a whole lot more you can do to escalate than
to call for a regime change," he told CNN's "State of the
Union."]{.underline}**

**[Washington, DC -- Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the
following statement calling for immediate actions to be taken to cut off
Vladimir Putin's ability to use energy resources as a weapon of war.
"The brutal war that Vladimir Putin has inflicted on the sovereign
democratic nation of Ukraine demands a fundamental rethinking of
American national security and our national and international energy
policy.]{.underline}** The United States, our European allies and the
rest of the world cannot be held hostage by the acts of one man. It is
simply inexplicable that we and other Western nations continue to spend
billions of dollars on energy from Russia. This funding directly
supports Putin's ability to stay in power and execute a war on the
people of Ukraine. We cannot decry the atrocities of Putin while
simultaneously funding his war. **[We as Americans must be willing to
act now. More importantly, we must commit to leading the world in
holding Putin and his oligarchs accountable]{.underline}**, to strangle
their financial lifelines and to hold all those who would support him
equally accountable for the violence they have inflicted on Ukraine.
"First, we must immediately ban the importation of all energy that is
sourced from Russia. This ban must be enacted now. "Second, we must
dramatically increase domestic production of energy to support the
energy needs of American consumers without causing increased financial
burden. "Third, we must compel every energy company -- especially those
in the U.S. and other Western nations -- to immediately cease any and
all investment, operations and production in Russia and in Russian
allies. While some companies have already acted, there needs to be a
complete commitment to destroying Putin's economic weapons for the pain
and horror he has brought to Europe. "Fourth, as a nation we must commit
to once again achieving complete energy independence by embracing an
all-of-the-above energy policy to ensure that the American people have
reliable, dependable and affordable power without disregarding our
climate responsibilities. **["Finally, we must dramatically increase our
military support to our NATO allies and position the necessary forces to
deter any escalation or threats to NATO members.]{.underline}** "While
we must do everything possible to end this conflict through diplomatic
means, we can no longer place the free world's national or energy
security in the hands of Vladimir Putin. **[The time has come for
America to once again lead the world in the fight for democracy and
securing freedom. We are the greatest and most powerful nation in the
world and we must seize this moment through our
leadership."]{.underline}**

should just "do what makes sense in terms of our own interests at any
particular moment and let other countries look out for themselves," was
found convincing by a much smaller number of 46%, including just 34% of
Democrats and half of independents (49%), although a majority of
Republicans did find it convincing (59%). This support translates to
specific policies, such as the US continuing to be part of NATO and
defending its members. **[An overwhelming bipartisan majority of eight

#### Ukraine crisis has taken the wind out of anti-defense sentiment -- strong bipartisan support to shore up defense and promote alliances

WASHINGTON --- [The escalating crisis in Ukraine is upending policy and
political thinking on both the left and the right on Capitol
Hill]{.underline}, as an immediate threat to the global order and
soaring energy prices empower the political center at the expense of the
two parties' flanks. When lawmakers convene on Wednesday for a virtual
speech by President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Republicans and
Democrats will be confronting a changed environment, for better and for
worse. "[It's bringing Congress together in a way]{.underline}, frankly,
[I haven't seen in my 12 years]{.underline}," Senator Chris Coons,
Democrat of Delaware and a confidant of President Biden, said on Tuesday
of the consensus to support Ukraine. "[You'd have to go back to 9/11 to
see such a unified commitment."]{.underline} That has meant a retreat by
both parties from the policy proposals and political messages that most
thrill their core supporters. [On the left, Democrats are **acquiescing
to higher military spending** and dropping a bid to pull back rapidly
from fossil fuels. On the right, **Trump-era isolationism** and attacks
on the trans-Atlantic alliance are being **relegated to the fringe** in
Congress.]{.underline} Plans to make the president's son Hunter Biden
and Ukrainian corruption front and center in a Republican-controlled
House now seem far-fetched. "It's grounding," said Representative Peter
Meijer, Republican of Michigan, who was once an intelligence analyst in
Afghanistan and now faces a challenger on his right endorsed by former
President Donald J. Trump. "You can propose something that outstrips the
bounds of reality, that's fine. Then you look at what's happening in
Ukraine, and it's like a car accident, a near-death experience that
snaps you back to reality." Mr. Zelensky is expected on Wednesday to
reiterate his request for a complicated swap that would send MIG fighter
jets to Ukraine from Poland, and U.S.-made F-16 fighters to Poland. That
could prompt accusations from some Republicans that the Biden
administration, which has opposed the swap as a dangerous escalation of
the conflict with no real military purpose, is soft on Russia. He is
also likely to ask the United States to help close the airspace over his
country to Russian aircraft, as he did on Tuesday when he addressed
Canada's Parliament. Republicans and Democrats alike have questioned the
MIG deal now that the Defense Department has raised specific concerns
about whether Ukraine could even fly the planes. Speaking to reporters
on Tuesday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader,
said Mr. Zelensky would not get congressional support for a so-called
no-fly zone over Ukraine, and he signaled ambivalence on the fighter jet
transfer. "Exactly how to make that happen is still under discussion,"
he said. It is unclear whether the moment amounts to a hiatus in the
partisan wars over national security. Republican leaders continue to
strafe the president, accusing him of being weak toward Russia, coddling
"petro-dictators" and betraying America's energy security. "President
Biden continues to have this attitude of, 'Well, I don't want to help
Ukraine too much' because he might offend Putin," Representative Steve
Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 Republican, said this week on Fox
Business, referring to Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin. Democrats
are incredulous that Republicans --- a vast majority of whom did not
criticize Mr. Trump for repeatedly standing by Mr. Putin, undermining
NATO and then withholding military aid from Mr. Zelensky to pressure him
to dig up political dirt on Mr. Biden --- have the gall to question the
current president's willingness to confront Russia. "If you are a
reporter, and there is a battle for the free world led by Zelensky and
Biden, you don't have to pretend not to remember that Republicans
exonerated Trump for extorting Zelensky," said Senator Brian Schatz,
Democrat of Hawaii. But beyond partisan potshots, [there are signs of
the war's **very real impact**]{.underline}. In December, when the House
passed defense policy legislation authorizing \$768 billion in military
spending, 51 Democrats voted no, mainly because they saw that as far too
much money. [Last week, when the House funded the military and provided
even more money --- \$782 billion and billions more for Ukraine --- the
number of Democrats voting in opposition **dropped to 15**.]{.underline}
"[Defense budgets should be driven by our needs]{.underline}, not some
artificial target, but [it's pretty clear we are living in a dangerous
time]{.underline}," said Representative Tom Malinowski of New Jersey, a
Democrat in a difficult re-election fight. [Representative Pramila
Jayapal]{.underline}, Democrat of Washington and the head of the
Congressional Progressive Caucus, [conceded that the current crisis had
**sapped momentum**]{.underline}, at least for now, [from efforts to
slash military spending.]{.underline} "I do think Ukraine has just made
it harder," she said. "We had thought with the ending of the war in
Afghanistan, we could push for a real reduction in the defense budget,
and there will be another opportunity. But look, this is an epic
battle." [Republicans are getting their own reality check.]{.underline}
Under Mr. Trump, a growing faction of the party was pushing
isolationism, questioning alliances and trade pacts, and pressing an
"America First" agenda that would have fit well in the national mood
leading up to World War II, Mr. Meijer said. In recent days,
Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a traditionalist Republican, sat
down with the German ambassador to the United States to thank her for
her country's commitment to NATO's defense and its aid to Ukraine. In an
interview, Mr. Cole even suggested reviving the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, a landmark trade pact negotiated by President Barack Obama
that would have tied together economies in Asia, Australia, New Zealand,
North America and South America to isolate China. In one of his first
acts as president, Mr. Trump scuttled the agreement. ["Ukraine has got a
lot of Republicans **rethinking** the importance of international
alliances,"]{.underline} Mr. Cole said. "Other countries are not always
a burden. They're quite often an asset." Fealty to Mr. Trump's foreign
policy suddenly seems like a potential liability. Former Gov. Pat
McCrory of [North Carolina]{.underline}, who is running for the Senate
seat held by Richard M. Burr, a [Republican]{.underline} who is
retiring, [hit his Trump-endorsed primary opponent]{.underline},
Representative Ted Budd, [as pro-Putin]{.underline} in a new
advertisement this week. "Budd's votes have been friendly toward
Russia," Mr. McCrory says in the ad. "He voted against sanctions on
Russia. These are serious times, and we need serious senators."

#### Fears of emboldened China and Russia make defense spending extremely popular

**Edmondson 22** - reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York
Times, covering Congress (Catie, "War in Ukraine Rallies Support in
Congress for More Military Spending," NY Times, 3-7-22,

"I haven't picked a number yet," he said, "but without question, it's
going to have to be bigger than we thought." He added: "[The Russian
invasion of Ukraine **fundamentally altered** what our national security
posture and what our defense posture needs to be]{.underline}. It made
it more complicated, and [it made it more expensive."]{.underline} His
shift signals a stark new reality facing President Biden on Capitol
Hill, where [Democrats had already shown they had little appetite for
controlling the defense budget]{.underline}, even as Mr. Biden declared
an end to the era of ground wars and indicated he wanted to reimagine
the use of American power abroad. [Now, facing a **military
onslaught**]{.underline} by President Vladimir V. Putin [**in Ukraine**,
and **rising fears of**]{.underline} a protracted war in Europe and [an
emboldened **China**, lawmakers in both parties --- including some who
had resisted in the past --- are pressing for **vast increases** in
military spending]{.underline} to address a changed security landscape.
As images pour out of Ukraine of cities devastated by a relentless and
indiscriminate volley of Russian missiles, Democrats and Republicans who
have struggled to coalesce behind meaningful legislation to aid the
Ukrainian cause are rallying around one of the few substantive tools
available to them: sending money and weapons. [The House this week is
poised to approve **\$10 billion** in emergency funds to
Ukraine]{.underline}, including \$4.8 billion to cover the costs of
weapons already sent to Ukraine and eastern flank allies, as well as the
deployment of American troops. But already on Monday, Senator Chuck
Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, suggested
lawmakers could approve a \$12 billion package, in a sign of how eager
lawmakers were to send more aid to Kyiv. [The United States alone has
deployed more than 15,000 troops to Europe, while committing an
additional 12,000 to NATO's response force]{.underline} if necessary.
Beyond funding immediate needs, [the consensus around more generous
Pentagon spending previews a dynamic that is likely to **drive
negotiations** around next year's defense budget]{.underline},
potentially locking in the kind of large increases that Mr. Biden and
many Democrats had hoped to end.

#### Spending is popular\-\--bipartisan support for an increase

Jimmy **Quinn**, 6-16-**2022**, National security correspondant for the

Year in a Row,\" National Review,

The **[Senate Armed Services Committee approved a version of the annual
defense authorization bill that would result in an \$847 billion defense
budget]{.underline}**, which is \$**[45 billion more than what the White
House requested]{.underline}**. After the administration released its
budget request earlier this year, lawmakers complained that the proposed
budget would essentially fail to keep pace with exploding inflation and
not match the 3--5 percent annual rise in defense spending recommended
by a bipartisan panel in 2018. Politico reported that the **[House Armed
Services Committee]{.underline}** still needs to put forward its own
version of the legislation but that it would **[likely also add money to
the White House request]{.underline}**. Congress also opted for a larger
budget than what the president requested in last year's defense bill,
authorizing \$749 billion in spending and enraging progressive
defense-budget-cut advocates. **[The decision to approve a larger
figure]{.underline}** than what Biden proposed was **[supported by
lawmakers from both parties]{.underline}**, motivated in large part by
rampant inflation. Senator Jack Reed, the committee's chairman, called
inflation "the first consideration" **[motivating the higher
defense-budget figure]{.underline}**, according to Politico. Another
reason to support the larger proposal was the **[message that it would
send about U.S. defense readiness]{.underline}**. Senator Roger Wicker,
the favorite to become the committee's chairman if Republicans win a
majority in the Senate next year, wrote on Twitter that the NDAA would
"send a strong signal" to U.S. adversaries such as Russia and China.

The FMTR source data have several limitations. First, the reports do not
systematically identify the use of military contractors. Second, FMTR
includes total budgets and trainees for both classified and unclassified
activities, but excludes additional details on classified activities and
omits training by the Central Intelligence Agency. This creates biases.
[**Considerable US assistance goes under the radar** in order to provide

### No L -- Public Loves

#### Military is sacrosanct -- public won't criticize, or question calls for increased cooperation

**Krebs and Ralston 21** -- Krebs is a Professor of Political Science
University of Minnesota and Ralston is an Assistant Professor in the
Department of Political Science and International Studies at the

More Political: How Americans' Views of the Military Have Changed Over

//sg

Americans' views on the relationship between civilian leaders and the
military are disturbing. When it comes to decisions about the use of
force, [recent surveys demonstrate that **Americans are inclined to
disempower civilians and defer to the professional military's
judgment**. Nor are Americans much troubled by active-duty, let alone
retired, military leaders publicly intervening in policy
debates.]{.underline} Moreover, Americans' opinions on the subject are
driven by their partisan political commitments. When Donald Trump was in
the White House, this meant that Democrats were surprisingly deferential
to the military, which they hoped would act as a check on this president
whom they distrusted and often reviled. But is the public's lack of
commitment to democratic civil-military relations, and its politicized
view of the military, a new problem? Or is it just the normal state of
affairs, amplified into a crisis by the churn of the news cycle? It is
hard to know because scholars and pollsters have not done regular, or
even occasional, deep dives with identical questions that allow for
direct comparisons. Over 20 years ago, in fall 1998 and spring 1999, the
Triangle Institute for Security Studies conducted a comprehensive survey
--- more comprehensive than any before or since --- of Americans' views
on civil-military relations. While occasional surveys have been fielded
since, including by us, they have asked different questions. As a
result, we do not know how Americans' views on civil-military relations
may have changed over the course of the last two decades. In June 2021,
therefore, we fielded a survey, via the Lucid platform, to a
representative United States-based sample of 913 respondents that
replicated many of the questions asked by the Triangle Institute nearly
a quarter-century ago. The Pull of Deference [Americans across the
political spectrum express considerably more deference to the military
today than they have in the past. In 1998 and 1999, the Triangle
Institute survey asked respondents whether they agreed or disagreed with
the following statement: "In general, high ranking civilian officials
rather than high ranking military officers should have the final say on
whether or not to use military force." A majority --- 53 percent --- of
respondents agreed.]{.underline} This result, among others, suggested
that Americans in the late 1990s had not fully grasped the principle of
civilian control of the military. [But even fewer of our 2021
respondents concur --- **just 43 percent. Deference to the military has
increased among self-identified members of both major political
parties**]{.underline}: Around 30 percent of both Republicans and
Democrats in the late 1990s strongly agreed with the statement that
civilians should have the final say on the use of force, but just [15
percent of Republicans and 24 percent of Democrats similarly strongly
agree in 2021.]{.underline}

### No L -- Manchin Loves

#### Manchin will always vote for defense spending -- he consistently disregards inflation when it comes to the military

**Cooper 21** \[Ryan Cooper is a national correspondent at TheWeek.com,
The Week, \"Joe Manchin whines about \$3.5 trillion --- but he spent
\$9.1 trillion on defense\",
https://theweek.com/democrats/1005529/joe-manchin-whines-about-35-trillion-but-he-spent-91-trillion-on-defense\]
GBS-HW

Whether President Biden\'s agenda fails at this point depends on two
people: Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.).
Earlier this week, Sinema appeared the more immovable obstacle. On
Wednesday, Manchin made it clear he\'s still in the running for that
infamous crown. \"I can\'t support \$3.5 trillion more in spending when
we have already spent \$5.4 trillion since last March,\" he wrote in a
statement apparently ruling out any new programs whatsoever.
\"\[S\]pending trillions more on new and expanded government programs,
when we can\'t even pay for the essential social programs, like Social
Security and Medicare, is the definition of fiscal insanity,\" Manchin
said. **[This is a complete crock, as Manchin\'s own actions prove: For
years, he has been casually voting for bloated defense budgets many
times the size of the Biden agenda]{.underline}**. His squalling about
overspending is dishonest nonsense, and he is utterly wrong about what
America can afford. Traditionally, media coverage of government programs
covers the estimated 10-year cost, because that\'s what the
Congressional Budget Office typically publishes. Sometimes there are
deviations from this rule --- the genuinely enormous pandemic relief
bills, for instance, were described by their one-year cost. Manchin is
conveniently conflating the two metrics, as Eric Levitz explains at New
York: The past year has witnessed the passage of three historically
large stimulus bills, which were characterized in headlines as the \"\$2
trillion coronavirus relief bill,\" the \"\$900 billion COVID-19 relief
bill,\" and the \"\$1.9 trillion relief bill,\" respectively. In each
case, these headlines (roughly) described the legislation\'s immediate,
single-year fiscal cost. By that metric, the Democrats\' reconciliation
package isn\'t a \$3.5 trillion bill; it\'s a \$350 billion one. \[New
York\] The one institution that habitually gets the one-year treatment
is the military, because troop worship is virtually mandatory in the
American mainstream press, and 10-year budgets would risk public
backlash. So let\'s redress that unfairness, and treat the Defense
Department as the Biden agenda has been treated. **[Let\'s see exactly
how much \"fiscal insanity\" Manchin routinely supports.]{.underline}**
Estimates of the defense budget vary between the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), but for
convenience\'s sake let me use the BEA figures. (We only need ballpark
accuracy for the argument.) By this measure, total federal spending on
defense consumption and investment in 2020 was \$881 billion. Assuming
that will be static over 10 years (and it won\'t be) gives us a 10-year
figure of \$8.8 trillion. That\'s almost certainly an underestimate,
however, because **[Congress keeps compulsively stuffing more money into
the Pentagon --- the House just added \$24 billion to the 2022 military
budget though Biden didn\'t ask for it and we just ended a major
war.]{.underline}** **[Manchin voted for the one-year portion of that
\$8.8 trillion --- and so much more. He was first elected to the Senate
in 2010, giving us a full decade of defense budgets under his
watch.]{.underline}** If we take the figures for each year from 2011 to
2020, adjust them for inflation, and add them all together, we get a
total of \$7.6 trillion in 2012 dollars. **[Then if we adjust again to
get 2021 dollars, we get a total of \$9.1 trillion over a
decade]{.underline}**. Again, these are rough figures, but they are
certainly in the right ballpark. **[Manchin voted for every single one
of the military budgets over the last decade]{.underline}** --- in 2011,
2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. **[He voted
for all \$9.1 trillion]{.underline}**. **[While he occasionally
complained about wasteful military programs and asked for an audit of
the Pentagon, these quibbles were never enough to get him to vote
differently]{.underline}**. He helped inflate the already-bloated war
budget and regularly boasted about thus \"supporting\" the troops. This
year, he did it again. So on one level, all this operatic moaning about
\$3.5 trillion is ridiculous hypocrisy. **[Manchin has casually voted
for nearly three times that for defense spending]{.underline}** ---
money that killed hundreds of thousands of people and turned half the
Middle East into a smoking crater. A modest fraction of that total to
help parents pay their bills, give seniors dental coverage, fight
climate change, and so forth is not some intolerable burden on the
economy.

### No L -- Sinema Loves

#### Love for defense spending applies to Sinema [too]{.underline} -- NDAA proves

**Jones 21** \[Ja\'han Jones is The ReidOut Blog writer for MSNBC,
\"Sinema, Manchin whined over infrastructure costs --- but silent on UFO
funds\", MSNBC,
https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/sinema-manchin-defense-bill-rcna8359\]
GBS-HW

**[Conservative Democrats who have pushed back on what they saw as
excessive spending in the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the Build
Back Better plan had virtually nothing to say about the gargantuan
defense spending bill the House passed this week. The National Defense
Authorization Act, a bill introduced annually to fund military spending,
breezed through the House in a 363-70 vote. It authorizes \$770 billion
for the military --- some \$25 billion more than President Joe Biden
requested]{.underline}** --- and includes funding for naval ships and
aircrafts, service member pay increases, nuclear weapons activities and
the formation of a new office to study UFOs. And look, I enjoy
extraterrestrial talk as much as the next person, but it doesn't sit
right with me that lawmakers who were up in arms about paying for things
such as expanded health care access and child care costs seem to have no
issue paying to investigate E.T. and ALF. **[Namely, I'm referring to
conservative Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten
Sinema of Arizona, who chirped all throughout House Democrats'
deliberations over the size and scope of the bipartisan infrastructure
bill signed into law last month.]{.underline}** We heard Manchin kvetch
over "entitlement" as the House considered whether to include paid
family leave in the social spending package. And in public, Sinema was a
rather aimless holdout throughout the negotiations, taking issue with
the price of Biden\'s legislative agenda without declaring what she'd
like to cut. We later learned she played a key role in watering down a
plan to lower prescription drug costs. **[Neither Manchin nor Sinema has
complained about the size of the NDAA.]{.underline}** Government largess
is apparently only real to conservative lawmakers, including these two
Democrats, when the spending involves actual people living stateside.
**[But when there are weapons of war and thirsty defense contractors
involved, these lawmakers suddenly have no issue abandoning their
conservatism. How convenient.]{.underline}**

### Tariff XO Solves

#### Biden can unilaterally lift tariffs on China -- that reduces inflation quickly and significantly 

**Tan 6/20**

Su-Lin, Senior Correspondent with CNBC, "Former U.S. ambassador says
lifting China tariffs could slash inflation by 1% over time, help Biden
in midterms" June 20, 2022
<https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/21/former-us-ambassador-says-lifting-china-tariffs-could-cut-inflation.html>

**[Removing tariffs on imported Chinese goods will strip 1% off
inflation in the U.S]{.underline}**. over time and return confidence to
the economy which could help President Joe Biden at the ballot box,
**[former U.S. ambassador David Adelman says.]{.underline}** "Inflation
will be No. 1 issue in midterm elections in the U.S. in November,"
Adelman told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Monday. "**[While the president is
limited]{.underline}** in his ability to control inflation, **[there is
one important tool in his toolbox]{.underline}**," said Adelman, who
served as U.S. ambassador to Singapore during the Obama administration.
"**[That is the ability to relieve the pressure on the American
economy]{.underline}** and American consumers that is **[caused
by]{.underline}** these **[very high tariffs rates]{.underline}** that
are imposed on more than \$370 billion annually of Chinese imports."
**["Many economists are saying that over time, you can have a full 1%
decrease in the CPI, something that is very meaningful for American
consumers]{.underline}**," he said, referring to the consumer price
index, a key measure of inflation." While former President Donald
Trump's trade war with China was popular among American voters on both
sides of the aisle in 2018, Adelman said the effort was economically
futile and did not create "meaningful" trade benefits. "I think the
proof is in the pudding. Not only was there no negative impact on the
Chinese economy, it had an impact on the U.S. economy. It has acted as a
boomerang on the U.S. economy," Adelman, who is also managing director
of KraneShares, said. "Biden is starting to realize as the election is
shaping up, it's going to be the economy that is most important to
voters. If the president can do anything to ease pressure, he should do
so. Ultimately, good economics should make good politics," he said. The
U.S. government is reviewing the Trump-era trade tariffs on Chinese
goods, a process that was triggered by legal provisions rather than a
U.S. political willingness for a reset in relations. **[A growing number
of economists, political observers and analysts have called on the Biden
administration to slash tariffs as inflation and recession fears
grow]{.underline}**. Former Treasury Secretary Larry **[Summers echoed
Adelman's comments]{.underline}** earlier Sunday, [**saying lifting
tariffs on Chinese imports was "the right to do."**]{.underline} "It
will hold down prices \[and\] enable us to take a more strategic
approach when dealing with China. It will take 1% or more off CPI over
time, cutting tariffs is the right thing to do. I hope the
administration will find a way to do it, " Summers said on NBC News'
"Meet the Press." Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said some tariffs on
China served "no strategic purpose" and that Biden was considering
removing them as a means of cooling inflation. Not only did China not
meet targets set by the U.S. in the trade deal, analysis from the
Peterson Institute for International Economics show the tariffs
increased inflation for both U.S. consumers and producers. In the year
to November 2021, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods added 0.26 percentage
points to the CPI, PIIE's non-resident senior fellow in trade policy
Katheryn Russ said in an analysis earlier this year. In the year after
the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, producer prices also rose by
1%, Russ's analysis also said. In March, PIIE's senior trade policy
fellow Chad Bown said China had not bought any of the additional \$200
billion of U.S. exports it committed to purchasing under the phase one
deal. As far as a dent to the Chinese economy was concerned, tariffs
knocked off just over 0.5% of China's GDP, Capital Economics chief Asia
economist Mark Williams said in a note last week. "Some Chinese firms
were able to evade them by re-routing shipments to the U.S. through
third countries, mainly in south-east Asia. This may have offset as much
as half of the drag," Williams said. Adelman, the former ambassador,
said **[Biden could remove certain tariffs without the onerous task of
seeking permission from Congress in two ways.]{.underline}** He could
order temporary exclusions to certain tariffs or sign an executive order
to lift the tariffs while protecting distinct U.S. industries that China
was competing with. Not only will **[removing tariffs be good for
American consumers in the short run and over time]{.underline}**, it
will help the President reset U.S.-China relations.

**[The US economy is likely to slow in 2022 and 2023 but will "narrowly
avoid a recession" as the Federal Reserve implements its rate-tightening
plan to curb inflation, the International Monetary Fund
said.]{.underline}** "The policy priority now must be to expeditiously
slow wage and price growth without precipitating a recession" the IMF
said in a statement Friday. "This will be a tricky task," as global
supply constraints and domestic labor shortages are likely to persist,
and the war in Ukraine creates additional uncertainties, it said. **[The
Fed's plan of quickly getting its benchmark rate to 3.5% to 4% "should
create an upfront tightening of financial conditions which will quickly
bring inflation back to target,"]{.underline}** Managing Director
Kristalina Georgieva told reporters following the release of the
concluding statement on its article IV consultation, the IMF's
assessment of countries' economic and financial developments following
meetings with lawmakers and public officials. **[Based on the policy
path outlined at the June Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and an
expected reduction in the fiscal deficit, the IMF expects the US economy
will slow, Georgieva said]{.underline}**. The fund has "also just
concluded a very useful set of discussions" with Treasury Secretary
Janet Yellen and Fed Chair Jerome Powell, she said. "We are conscious
that there is a narrowing path to avoiding a recession in the US,"
Georgieva said. "We also have to recognize the uncertainty of the
current situation." Georgieva at the press conference on Friday went on
to say there are "very significant" downside risks this year and
especially in 2023. **[If there ultimately is a recession, it would
likely be relatively short, said Nigel Chalk, deputy director in the
IMF's Western Hemisphere department.]{.underline}** Policy makers raised
interest rates by 75 basis points last week \-- the single-biggest move
since 1994 \-- and Powell signaled that another increase either of the
same magnitude or of 50 basis points was on the table for July. **[The
Fed chief and his colleagues have pivoted aggressively to fight the
hottest inflation in 40 years amid criticism that they left monetary
policy too easy for too long as the economy recovered from
Covid-19.]{.underline}** They've raised rates by 1.5 percentage points
this year and officials forecast about 1.75 points of further cumulative
tightening in 2022.

Street Journal Editorial board member Kim Strassel and Rightforge

inflation issue and the fed ordering largest rate hike in 28 years on
'WSJ at Large.' **[Like hapless baseball players in a big-time
slump]{.underline}**, President **[Biden and
Dem]{.underline}**ocrat**[s]{.underline}** **[in Congress just keep
striking out when it comes to lowering the historic levels of inflation
they caused by massive spending and threats of tax
increases.]{.underline}** Eighteen months of unified Democratic control
in Washington have taught us that it's easier to break an economy than
to fix it -- and this **[economic hardship isn't on track to end anytime
soon]{.underline}**. Still, there are some commonsense steps we can take
to bring some relief to the American people. Democrats have taken their
eye off the ball when it comes delivering economic relief and we are all
paying the price. Gasoline prices have hit a record \$5 a gallon and
overall inflation has surged to its highest level in 40 years.
Bidenflation has cut the pay of every American worker, causing real
wages to drop nearly 4% since the current administration took office.
Yet **[Democrats continue to]{.underline}** double down on their same
failed policies. They **[ignore studies from the San Francisco Federal
Reserve, former top Obama]{.underline}**-Biden **[economic
advisers]{.underline}** Jason Furman and Larry Summers **[and even the
president's own favorite economic forecaster, showing that Biden\'s
agenda will make inflation worse.]{.underline}** Grocery shoppers in New
York and Virginia shared how the economy under Joe Biden has impacted
them after the president\'s outburst during an AFL-CIO conference.
President Biden and Democrats in Congress continue to swing and miss
when it comes to finding workable solutions, opting instead to attack
bogeymen like big corporations, COVID or the war in Ukraine. First, we
should soak up some of the excess money floating around in the economy
and reduce the deficit. Inflation skyrocketed immediately following
passage of the \$1.9 trillion Democrat/Biden backed American Rescue Plan
(ARP). With supply chains still struggling to come back online, and a
labor shortage induced by President Biden paying people more to stay at
home than to go to work, this so-called stimulus flooded the economy
with too much money chasing too few goods. With the public health
emergency behind us, Congress should repurpose the unobligated ARP
funding, estimated to be \$200 billion, to deficit reduction. That would
help remove some of the inflation-causing money from the economy. But
you guessed it: Democrats in Congress show no interest in redirecting
those funds. Second, let's unleash American energy independence. With
gasoline prices at all-time highs, we can make it easier to get permits
to drill, transport and refine domestic energy, which would increase
supply and lower prices. By rejecting Republican bills that expand
American energy production, President Biden and the Democrats are
committing economic malpractice. They claim inflation is their top
priority, but their knee-jerk reaction against increasing the supplies
of natural gas and oil and building pipeline infrastructure proves their
war on fossil fuel is the real priority. American consumers and workers
are the casualties. Third, remove the barriers that prevent our job
creators from expanding. Too much red tape and burdensome federal
regulations raise costs for businesses that then gets passed on to
consumers. Whether it's new Labor Department paperwork, burdensome
environmental regulations, or lengthy permitting requirements, the Biden
administration is building a mountain of new costs that directly lead to
price increases for consumers. According to an analysis of Biden's first
year in office by the American Action Forum, his administration's
regulatory costs are three times that of Obama's first year and nearly
40 times that of Trump's. Each individual regulation may not increase
inflation, but collectively the sum total of this activist regime drives
costs and inflation higher. Fourth, make Republican tax reform permanent
and lock in its historic achievement of higher wages for the lowest
earners, the lowest unemployment in 50 years and rapid economic growth.
President **[Biden\'s persistent threat to]{.underline}** deliver on his
campaign promise of **[repealing]{.underline}** these **[tax cuts and
raising taxes further fuels inflation. Businesses need certainty to
create a stable environment to invest and grow, yet Democrats continue
to talk about imposing]{.underline}** ~~crippling~~ tax hikes and
**[policies that expand welfare-without-work policies that keeps Main
Street understaffed, store shelves empty and prices high.]{.underline}**
By doubling down on policies that have put us on the brink of a
recession, **[the president is sending all the wrong
signals]{.underline}** when it comes to getting our country back on
track.

[debt]{.mark} well north of [100%. Did the dollar]{.mark} subsequently
[collapse? No]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The dollar was defined as 1/35th
of a gold ounce. Too much gold for you? That's fine. Let's move to Asia.
Japan in particular. Its government debt has soared over the decades.
During that time the yen has risen pretty substantially against the
dollar from 360/1USD to 114/1USD. And what about the U.S.?
**[[In]{.mark} 19[80]{.mark}, total U.S. federal [debt was]{.mark} a

amassed]{.mark} over the decades by the U.S. had [result]{.mark}ed [in
inflation]{.mark}, Treasury [yields would have risen]{.mark}, not
fallen.]{.underline}** The above stats are just a few data points to
call into the question the increasingly popular narrative among
economists, pundits, and very deep thinkers about the alleged
relationship between government debt and inflation. There is none. To be
clear about what was just said, this opinion piece is not a defense of
government spending or borrowing. Government spending is a freedom and
economy-sapping tax, period. When governments spend either thanks to
taxation or borrowing, the economy-neutering effect is the same. And
it's harmful. If you believe otherwise, and most economists puzzlingly
do, you believe Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell are better capital
allocators than Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel. The main thing is that
statistics or history aren't necessary to show why **[government [debt
doesn't cause inflation]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Logic is all that's
required. Inflation is a devaluation]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of the
currency]{.underline}**. Yet **[budget [deficits signal a willingness
on]{.mark} the part of [investors to buy]{.mark} future [income
streams]{.mark} from the government taking on the deb]{.underline}**t.
Ok, so by the thought processes of the pundit and economics classes,
investors eagerly fund the borrowing of the very nations that intend to
stiff them with devaluation. No, it doesn't work that way. Or it doesn't
have to. Indeed, it's no doubt true that more than a few nations have
devalued their way out of massive debt over the decades and centuries.
But it's a reminder that debt doesn't cause inflation, as much as some
nations choose to foist their profligacy on their citizens and
creditors. Which means **[the pundit class is reversing causation. While
nations that do a reasonable job of protecting their currencies can run
up lots of debt, nations that inflate it away cannot. All of which is a
long or short way of saying that inflation restrains government
borrowing.]{.underline}** Which is a statement of the obvious. Many in
the pundit class will say "central banks" conduct just that sort of
lending. Oh dear....So we're supposed to believe that arms of government
can finance government? If this were even remotely true, the Soviet
Union would still exist today care of Gosbank. **[[Despite the
tendency]{.mark} of the deep in thought [to get deficits and inflation
backwards, they keep making their silly
cases]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} In an opinion piece last week for
the Wall Street Journal, Thomas Sargent and William Silber cited Milton
Friedman's quip in the 1970s that inflation had resulted from "ever more
goodies" sans commensurate tax hikes as the cause of the 1970s
inflation. Oh yes, nothing to do with the explicit devaluation of the
dollar in 1971 whereby President Nixon severed the dollar's link to
gold. Naaah. Nothing to see there.

### No Recession

#### Inflation effects will be mild -- well-supported banks, high saving, and plentiful jobs prove

**Lee 6-22**-22 \[Don Lee covers the U.S. and global economy out of

that bad. Here\'s why\", Los Angeles Times,
https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-06-22/recession-looks-unavoidable-but-will-it-be-that-bad\]
GBS-HW

**[WASHINGTON --- Whether it's President Biden insisting a recession is
avoidable or his critics arguing that the wolf is at the door, both
sides are acting as if the nation faces an unprecedented
catastrophe.]{.underline}** Partly it's political theater --- Biden
fighting on behalf of an already beleaguered presidency and many of the
doomsayers hoping a downturn could be the coup de grace for Democrats.
Behind the rhetoric, the reality is that recessions are a normal part of
American economic life. **[The U.S. has had one, on average, every 6½
years since 1945. And in the present case, most professional economists
think any downturn now is likely to be relatively mild, with a fairly
quick recovery. "We're calling for a small 'r' recession," said Jack
Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital. "It means it's not
going to be protracted and things aren't going to fall
apart,"]{.underline}** as they did during the Great Recession and again
in 2020 when the pandemic struck. **[Many households are flush with
cash, and jobs are plentiful with demand for new workers strong. Banks
are well capitalized, which gives them a solid buffer against a business
contraction.]{.underline}** What may be different this time is the
public's state of mind, coupled with a handful of unusual factors ---
first among them the grinding war in Ukraine. For most Americans, the
pandemic and its accompanying economic upheaval came after an
extraordinarily long period of relative economic stability. The economy
was not growing much and real incomes were stagnating, but unemployment
was low among most population groups, prices were stable, interest rates
were at rock bottom and stores were flooded with low-cost goods made
overseas. Most people had adjusted to the status quo. So the COVID-19
downturn hit like a thunderbolt, and the outbreak of inflation ---
driven largely by consumers suddenly beginning to spend their
pandemic-induced savings --- was another jolt to popular expectations.
Now, economic indicators look primed for a recession. The broad-based
Standard & Poor's 500 stock index is down more than 20% since its high
Jan. 3. U.S. consumer confidence has sunk to record lows, thanks largely
to high inflation. Retail spending, home-building and manufacturing
output all declined last month. And consumers, who drive the U.S.
economy, are starting to cut back on discretionary purchases, things
such as appliances and services. Tom Straus, owner of Straus Carpets in
Oakland, has seen a sudden drop-off in orders for new flooring jobs at
homes in the San Francisco Bay Area. Typically his commercial business
includes about \$1 million in projects for schools during the summer;
such orders so far this year total just \$30,000. "Our future work is
diminishing," he said. Many other leaders of businesses, small and
large, as well as workers, are bracing for harder times, with fears
stoked by the Federal Reserve's plans for more fat interest rate
increases to combat high inflation. "We're skating on the edge of
recession, especially with the Fed bringing out these big guns," said
Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at the financial market research
firm Fwdbonds. Larry Summers, Harvard economist and former Treasury
secretary, notes that whenever inflation tops 4% (it was more than
double that in May) and unemployment drops below 4% (it was 3.6% last
month), that's an indication of an overheating economy that in the past
has always brought recession within a year or two. **[Whether inflation
is avoidable, the real question may be: How bad and how long will the
next downturn be? And on this score, there is greater consensus among
experts that it'll probably be nothing like the most recent
episodes.]{.underline}** One common definition of a recession is two
consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, that is, shrinking
gross domestic product. But an official designation is made by a
nonprofit research organization, which looks at a broad set of data and
declares a recession, usually months after it's begun. The Great
Recession that began in late 2007 lasted 18 months --- the longest in 90
years --- and was also one of the deepest. Millions of Americans lost
their jobs and homes after the real estate bubble burst and large
banking companies cratered. The unemployment rate shot up to 10%. The
pandemic-inflicted recession in 2020 was the shortest on record, just
two months from peak to trough, according to the National Bureau of
Economic Research. But the sudden collapse in the economy was
unparalleled as businesses across the country closed and consumers
sheltered in place for weeks. Some 22 million jobs evaporated between
February and April that year. The rebound since then has been fast and
strong, largely because of unprecedented government aid to households
and businesses. Several rounds of stimulus checks helped boost consumer
spending and demand, contributing to higher inflation. Much of that
money hasn't been spent yet, which will provide a cushion for many
households. **[Americans overall had excess savings of \$2.7 trillion in
the first quarter]{.underline}**, according to Moody's Analytics'
calculations based on Fed and other government data. **[Although more
than half of that was held by households in the top 10% of income, those
in the bottom 20% had on average about \$5,700 more cash in hand than
they otherwise would have without the federal aid and the effects of the
pandemic.]{.underline}** **[Those extra savings, along with historically
low household debt and loan-servicing burden --- many homeowners locked
in low mortgage rates before the recent increases --- suggest that most
people are better positioned financially and could help make the next
recession milder.]{.underline}** At Bank of America Institute, economist
David Tinsley saw a noticeable uptick in BofA customers using their
credit cards last month, as was the case at many banks. High gas prices,
he says, are hitting lower-income families hard and also cutting into
spending for goods. But looking at BofA customers' savings deposits and
checking account balances, Tinsley said, "households continue to have
high buffers relative to before the pandemic." For John Barone, 58, the
difference between where he was on the eve of the Great Recession and
today is like night and day. In 2007, he was running his own home
renovation business in Baltimore, making payments on a \$1-million loan.
When the housing market crashed, he laid off 20 workers and eventually
lost his business, his home and his wife. Today Barone and a business
partner operate out of Washington, D.C., giving tours with their seven
golf carts. His business debts are modest --- \$32,000 in bank loans for
two electric vehicles. Barone has seven seasonal workers and lives
modestly in an apartment on Capitol Hill. "I don't have a car, don't
have to buy gas," he said. "I go to the day-old bread shelf and buy my
bread for half price." Barone is more sanguine than most. Nationally,
small-business owners were asked last month by the National Federation
of Independent Business how they see conditions over the next six
months. The result was the lowest reading in 48 years. At larger
companies, a May survey of 750 top executives by the Conference Board
found that more than 60% of them see a recession coming or already here.
Both surveys, however, suggest employers aren't sure what that may mean
as far as employment and potential for layoffs. Many employers are still
struggling to fill job vacancies and could be reluctant to let go of
workers right away. The jobless rate stood at 3.6% in May, a notch above
the half-century pre-pandemic low, and there are still nearly two job
openings for every person officially unemployed. New unemployment
claims, a proxy for layoffs, have been edging higher in recent weeks but
remain low by historical standards. Job growth in May was the slowest in
12 months, but still a robust 390,000. "Of course we're slowing down,
but let's remember how fast we had been growing," said Carl Tannenbaum,
chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago. One thing that worries
Tannenbaum is the risk of knock-on effects from the Fed's move to jack
up interest rates. The pivot has already taken a big bite out of the
U.S. housing market, but the tightening by the Fed and other central
banks could also slam developing countries and the global economy as
investors reshuffle funds. That could circle back to drag down the U.S.
Economists say the Fed misread the threat of inflation and was slow to
abandon its easy-money policies, but it's now racing to catch up and
raise its benchmark interest rate aggressively to cool demand and slow
growth, including in the job market. "I think they're seeing it like the
worst of two worlds --- either stagflation or recession," said Beth Ann
Bovino, chief U.S. economist at Standard & Poor's Ratings Services.
Stagflation --- a condition of high inflation and stagnant activity ---
plagued the economy in the 1970s and ended only after the Fed raised
interest rates high and drove the economy into a deep doubled-dip
recession in the early 1980s. "My belief is that in order to avoid
stagflation, I think they would risk the economy and go for the
recession rather than suffer stagflation for however many years," Bovino
said. Jeffrey Korzenik, chief investment strategist at Fifth Third Bank
in Tampa, Fla., said the country will avoid a recession, barely, largely
because of the strength of the labor market. He figures the Fed's
tightening will create more layoffs but said, "We have so many openings,
it'll be easier to get workers recycled into the job market**[. It's not
bulletproof, but it means the economy is less likely to fall off a
cliff."]{.underline}**

**[RECESSION IS COMING!]{.underline}** --- You read it here first,
people. **[Take it to the bank.]{.underline}** The U.S. is headed toward
an economic downturn. Because it always is. We have clearly not --- as
some hoped during recent booms --- repealed the business cycle and
entered a period of permanent growth. **[Recessions always
arrive.]{.underline}** So the question is not whether we are headed
toward one. Because, well, duh. The questions are: When will recession
hit? What will cause it? And how bad will it be? And while we may not be
in one yet (though it's possible we are), **[I'm sorry to report that
the conditions are ripe for a slide in gross domestic product growth
that lasts at least two quarters, the technical definition of
recession.]{.underline}** I say we may already be in one because growth
in the first quarter slid 1.5 percent. And analysts are mostly
downgrading estimates for the second quarter to close to zero, based on
slipping retail sales, plunging consumer and business sentiment and an
aggressive Federal Reserve bumping up historically low interest rates to
battle runaway inflation of close to 9 percent. The Atlanta Federal
Reserve's "GDP Now" model pegs second quarter growth at 0.0 percent. For
real. Exactly zero. They probably won't nail it on the head. **[So the
question is whether we'll get just a tiny bit of growth or a small
decline. If the latter, well, that's a recession.]{.underline}** But
probably not one that people will notice very much --- some of the
recent declines had quirky inventory changes in them that should get
reversed. Consumer and business spending (the big drivers of the
economy) have held up remarkably well, meaning if we do get a negative
second quarter, we should bounce back at least a bit in the second half
of the year. **[The scary bit is really what happens next year and
beyond.]{.underline}** And economists, politicians, Wall Street traders
and pretty much everyone else is growing more concerned that a
significant downturn could arrive in 2023. **[The main reason is
obvious: Steady and significant rate hikes from the Fed often trigger at
least mild recessions.]{.underline}** It's a feature, not a bug. Fed
Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues will never say it out loud. But
they'd take a recession rather than allow prices to continue to spin out
of control. The intent of hikes, after all, is to slow down consumer and
business spending and thus arrest rising prices. And the current Fed has
its foot hard on the brakes at the moment, with a second
three-quarter-point increase expected next month, followed by half-point
increases in September and November, then by another quarter point in
December. These would still get the Fed's target rate only into somewhat
normal range from effectively below zero. But mere anticipation of the
moves has already driven mortgage rates to 6 percent. Interest rates on
everything else, from auto loans to credit cards, will likely be headed
significantly higher. And this will happen as consumers are already
drawing down their significant Covid-era savings to keep up with
inflation. Credit card debt is rising, and servicing that debt is
growing more expensive. After booming during Covid, Americans' savings
rate has taken a major dive. The figure hit just 4.4 percent in April,
the lowest since September 2008 during the Great Recession. Big
companies like Tesla, Netflix and the trading platform Robinhood have
spoken of hiring freezes and potential layoffs. The once-booming
cryptocurrency market is a giant mess. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is
talking about a "hurricane" possibly hitting the economy. **[Oh, and
politics won't help. The midterms could very well lead to divided
government again in D.C., with Republicans taking at least one chamber
on Capitol Hill.]{.underline}** If that happens, it could easily take us
back to the days of debt ceiling and government shutdown fights that
plagued the economy and the Obama administration after the 2010
midterms. **[Mix it all together --- big rate hikes, strapped consumers,
freaked-out executives and possibly gridlocked government --- and there
is potential for a quite significant recession.]{.underline}**
