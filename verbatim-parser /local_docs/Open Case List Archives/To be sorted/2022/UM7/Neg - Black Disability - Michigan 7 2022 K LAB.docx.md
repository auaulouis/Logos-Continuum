Further, [[deconstructing differences will not]{.mark} in and of itself
[produce respect and equality between all people with various
characteristics. Neither will it result in a social order free from a
sense of difference.]{.mark} It is simply unrealistic to assume that a
society could exist were people would not see some other people as
different]{.underline}, and their lives or characteristics as
representing a deviation from some norm considered important regarding
good human life. This is because [[some]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
[[individual characteristics]{.underline}]{.mark} that define disabled
people [[are, sometimes]{.underline}]{.mark} with good reason,
[[undesirable, even in a utopia]{.mark} where all differences would have
been queered.]{.underline} [**[Disability is not the same]{.mark}**
as]{.underline} many [other group identities]{.underline} and we need to
explore both morally and socially disability and difference rather than
simply use difference as a concept through which to critique the
disability identity. [There are no rational reasons to consider
homosexuality or gender undesirable characteristics whatever the social
context,]{.underline} but there are many impairments that can reasonably
be seen as undesirable (Shakespeare 2006). [[Motor neuron disease,
depression or spinal cord injury are]{.underline}]{.mark} the kinds of
[[conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[we would prefer not to]{.mark}
have, and this is not merely because of the cultural representations
attached to them but because **[these conditions]{.mark} are the kinds
of predicaments that [cause suffering irrespective of one's cultural

[impairments]{.mark} can include an undesirable dimension **[does not
imply devaluing people with impairments]{.mark}** nor their positive
group identity]{.underline} (Shakespeare and Watson 2010). As long as
people are genuinely free to decide for themselves and feel about
themselves however they wish to feel, we are pretty close to relational
justice, free from hierarchical evils. [Imposing on people ableist or
disablist assumptions is certainly wrong, but so would be the denial of
the personal experiences]{.underline} of fearing the loss of one's
physical and mental capacities, or the fear of dying (Carel 2008). [To
explain the psychological anguish related to conditions such as motor

nonsensical.

What [I am]{.underline} also [unwilling to take]{.underline} with [the
theory of assemblage]{.underline} is the freighted territory [of the
cyborg:]{.underline} [the feminist materialist theory of becoming
developed by Donna Haraway that combines human, animal, and machine as a
radical political enterprise that ushers in the future both
theoretically and practically]{.underline}. I have found it useful as a
thought exercise that complicates the relationship of the body to itself
and to others and deals with our very real reliance on machines and
kinship with animals. Since the cyborg opens up the conversation about
futurity---which usually elides madness and Blackness---it also becomes
a useful space to consider who we are becoming.60 Certainly, to think
through our kinship with machines is apropos for discussions of
disability given the medicalization of certain bodies, and remains so
given my emphasis on speculative fiction. But [the cyborg is an
incomplete, politically fraught, and ethically suspicious answer to a
series of questions about raced and disabled futurity.]{.underline}
[Material reality must reckon with]{.underline} what others have pointed
out are the [lived experiences of the Black and disabled
body]{.underline}, what amount to (in this project, at least) the gaps
and folds within Black speculative fiction. Read in alignment with Tobin
Siebers's theory of complex embodiment and Alison Kafer's questioning of
spatial, cultural, and temporal logics, the [emphasis on the cyborg and
the desire to supersede the body has an antagonistic relationship with
concerns at the heart of disability studies: pain, fiscal access, and
the validity of embodied experience]{.underline}, to name a few.61 [What
happens when one does not desire cyborgian intervention as
cure?]{.underline} [What of those for whom material cyborgian realities
are more painful than useful or pleasurable? As much as cyborgian
futures promise a radical set of possibilities for considering
disability,]{.underline} [we ought to be wary]{.underline} of them
[because they are also reliant on a set of middleclass]{.underline} (or
rich) [realities]{.underline}. I have elsewhere pointed out the way [the
cyborg's promise of radical potential hinges on an original white
Western subject]{.underline}.62 Leaning on Donna Haraway's original
definition, [João Costa Vargas and Joy A. James understand the Black
cyborg as a postbellum construction that requires Black
degradation]{.underline}: "A Black cyborg: a modified, improved human
whose increased ethical, spiritual, and physical capabilities generate
unusual strength, omniscience, and boundless love."63 [They invoke
Haraway's understanding of the cyborg as]{.underline} both [real and
fictive to pinpoint how the Black cyborg relies on a set of interracial
dynamics that extend from a history steeped in anti-Blackness. The Black
cyborg is required to participate in its own self abnegation since it is
built on top of the foundations of American democratic and imperial
projects reliant on phobic understandings of Blackness]{.underline}. The
[Black cyborg, then, in Vargas and James's formulation, echoes that of
the disabled cyborg: neither can escape the desire for normalcy that
erases Blackness and madness both.]{.underline} Alison Kafer reads in
the gaps of Haraway's work and its intellectual genealogy to reinsert
the oft-overlooked contributions of women of color---among them Octavia
E. Butler and Chela Sandoval---to the definition of the cyborg. She
pinpoints that the [cyborg as transgressive figure has limited
potential]{.underline} precisely [because of how it has
been]{.underline} developed and [mobilized in ways that erase women of
color and reify the virgule between disabled and
able-bodied.]{.underline} Though the cyborg asks for blasphemous
interpretation---a promise and proposition Kafer, Vargas, and James
readily champion---as part of its political transgression, I question
how much the cyborg can map a future of any kind when it relies on a
past and path of erasure. What [the cyborg ushers in]{.underline}---that
I'd prefer to leave aside for this discussion---is [an assemblage yoked
to anti-Blackness and ableism, a]{.underline} method of becoming that
requires theoretical overcoming [since the theories rely on but refuse
disabled and Black embodiment.]{.underline}

**[[Cyborg hoaxes, deceptive forms of identity presentation that
articulate gender, disability, and technology, have been
persistent]{.mark}]{.underline}** but unremarked upon elements of online
culture. By identifying, contextualizing, and deconstructing them, this
article has highlighted the persistence of an ideology of ability in
online culture and in cyberculture and Internet studies. [An ideology of
ability is at work in the pitiable presentation of a digital sweet
innocent and in the excuses offered by cancer. Identifying these themes
reveals that online cultures remain closely connected to larger
ideologies and norms.]{.underline} Far from offering a "liberation
technology" (Coombs, 1991[**), [online spaces may reproduce and amplify
the prejudices and normative assumptions of a broader cultural context.
These deceptive assemblages deploy disability strategically for an
able-bodied audience,]{.mark} taking advantage of existing hierarchies.
Yet, they may also challenge the very ideologies upon which they
depend**.]{.underline} For instance, the prominence of romance and
sexuality in these hoaxes counters very real tendencies to desexualize
people with disabilities[. **[Such contradictions, and the blurring of
identity and technology, are indicative of the "cyborg" component of
these hoaxes]{.mark}.**]{.underline} While I retained this language in
order to highlight the possibility of such provocations, it is in the
experiences of people with disabilities using online media that a richer
form of cyborg can be found. [These experiences reflect a variety of
possible linkages of gender and sexuality, disability, and technology.
In these formations, people with disabilities can be understood "as
cyborgs not because of \[their\] bodies (e.g. our use of prosthetics,
ventilators, or attendants), but because of \[their\] political
practices"]{.underline} (Kafer, 2013: 120**[). [In claiming disability
identity and engaging in community formation, by reconfiguring default
settings of computer hardware and software, and by speaking back to
dominant narratives of disability and gender, these individuals and
communities are producing disability technocultures that are seditious
and, too often, invisible.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Disability is a
necessary and theoretically rich addition to the forms of identity,
community, and material technology that have dominated critical and
cultural studies of digital media. Present since the earliest
cyberculture work, but rendered invisible or metaphorical, disability
offers important critical resources for the nuanced and complex study of
the digital networked media that increasingly permeate daily life. Not a
metaphor, and not invisible, but ever-present and meaningful, disability
offers a lens through which to examine theoretical assumptions and
exclusions and with which to critically interrogate normative forms of
digital media and the ideological structures that maintain and challenge
them.

**Even if political liberalism currently excludes the disabled,
discussing questions of implementation can revise it**

and the justice claims of the disabled: a reconciliation," Critical

I argue that any proposal [[abandoning the language of political justice
would not]{.underline}]{.mark} seem to [[do enough for]{.mark} those
[individuals with disabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} who fall outside the
basic idea of persons as depicted by Rawls. In fact, the intuitions
supporting [the idea that concepts like rights and opportunities are
indispensable are very strong.]{.underline}11 Let us go back to the
examples of individuals falling outside Rawls's idea of persons because
their disabilities prevent them from being a net beneﬁt to social
cooperation. [They are [individuals]{.mark}]{.underline} who need
multiple carers to work, or [[whose disabilities prevent them from
providing a beneﬁt to social cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} that is
large enough. To put the point more sharply, it is worth noticing that
the disabilities in question are compatible with being in full
possession of one's logical and moral powers. Now, **[[should we
accept]{.mark} that [those individuals ought to be given no
rights]{.mark} or opportunities?]{.underline}** An afﬁrmative answer
would strike us as implausible, and for a good reason. In [a liberal
society, having one's rights, opportunities and]{.underline} basic
distributive [entitlements acknowledged is one and the same as being
recognized as an equal.]{.underline} And what is missing from Rawls's
political liberalism is precisely the idea that falling below a
threshold of full cooperation should not be enough to prevent the
disabled from being regarded as persons on an equal footing with anyone
else. In sum, [Rawls's political liberalism is not amenable to any
extension that,]{.underline} keeping the basic ideas of society and
persons intact, [is able to include a concern with the status of
individuals with disabilities.]{.underline} In addition, the proposal
that the interests of the disabled are not for public reason to protect
is not satisfactory. [Consequently, a]{.underline} substantial
**[[revision is the only way to reconcile political liberalism
with]{.underline}]{.mark}** our intuitions concerning **[[what is due to
the disabled]{.mark}.]{.underline}** 5. Revising political liberalism I:
beyond Hartley's contractualism The aim of this section and the next is
to propose a substantial revision of Rawls's theory that accommodates
the justice claims of the disabled while upholding the project of
political liberalism. [A question that needs to be answered]{.underline}
at this point [is: **why should we uphold**]{.underline} the project of
[**political liberalism, rather than endorsing a different model** that
more neatly ﬁts with our]{.underline} intuitions concerning [what is due
to the disabled**?**]{.underline} First, the general project of
[[political liberalism is compelling]{.mark}.]{.underline} Rawls's
political liberalism aims to identify a common ground of political ideas
that can work as the basis on which the most important political
decisions should be made. [This project is of the greatest importance
because]{.underline}, if successful, [[it creates legitimacy by building
institutions on the basis of concepts]{.mark} that are [acceptable to
each]{.mark}]{.underline} reasonable [[individual]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Moreover, it promotes stability in societies that are characterized by
deep pluralism. Second, [[despite Rawls's failure to take]{.mark} the
interests of [the disabled into consideration,]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[political liberalism is well suited to support the justice claims of
individuals with disabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This is because
[the idea that the disabled are citizens who deserve our respect is part
of the common culture]{.underline} of our societies. In other words,
there is an overlapping consensus on the idea that rights, opportunities
and distributive shares must be granted to individuals who are not fully
cooperating members of society, including those who fall below full
moral powers. It is widely believed that [[those with]{.mark} physical
[disabilities should have the same rights as]{.mark} their [fellow
citizens, live in a social environment that does
not]{.mark}]{.underline} excessively [[limit their opportunities and
receive beneﬁts that]{.mark} help [meet their]{.mark}]{.underline}
special [[needs]{.mark}.]{.underline} Besides, although the state or
third parties are given exceptional rights to interfere with the
autonomy of individuals with severe cognitive disabilities, [it is
widely recognized that the mentally disabled are citizens whose basic
interests must be protected by the law.]{.underline}12 In the public
space, any proposal that individuals who are not fully cooperating
members of society should have their basic interests neglected would be
widely received with outrage. Such proposal would be said to ﬁt a
fascist society, not a decent one. Among other legal documents, the
United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN
General Assembly, A/61/611) can be taken as the epitome of this
widespread attitude. Adopted in 2006, the Convention requires that all
individuals with disabilities should share in the enjoyment of equal
fundamental rights.

International Relations (**[[IR]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [is a field of
vision]{.underline}. Elements traditional to IR like nuclear
[deterrence]{.underline}, armed [conflict]{.underline},
[terrorism]{.underline}, or [great power balancing]{.underline}, all
[**[require states to]{.mark}** interpret]{.underline} the
[behavior]{.underline} and posture of other actors [to
**[define]{.mark}**]{.underline} the menu of
**[[options]{.underline}]{.mark}** that are [available]{.underline} to
them. [Ontological security theorists]{.underline} in general
[agree]{.underline} with this position, [arguing]{.underline} that
[feelings and interpretations of]{.underline} their [security are
required for states to understand their position in relation to
others]{.underline} in the international system. Thus, a state's
identity is defined as much by its relationship and feeling of threat
toward and among other states. But **[[what happens if]{.mark} the
linchpin of defining [a state's security is
covert]{.mark}]{.underline}**, what if [the mechanisms by which a state
understands its security standing is accomplished not in the light, but
rather in the shadows, around computer networks, non-state actors,
disinformation campaigns, hacking, and at least for democratic states
like the US through electoral manipulation?]{.underline}

At a recent conference panel with intelligent scholars of various stripe
I was asked 'when was the last cyber attack?' They noted the presence of
Stuxnet (a US-Israeli produced computer virus targeting the Iranian
nuclear refining infrastructure at the Natanz plant) but hinted in
confusion that there had not been much since. And my colleague was not
alone, polling on the threat of cyber-attack routinely finds that these
actions among the lowest of concerns for most Americans,1 The problem
inherent in the disconnect between the assumptions of my informed
colleagues and the reality of the cyber landscape is vision and sight.
[**[Cyberthreats]{.mark}** often **[fall in between]{.mark}** and within
the context of our **[blindspots, hackers and non-state actors]{.mark}
use the fact** that much of what they do, be it malware or ransomware
toward a hospital, misinformation or disinformation online, or direct
attacks on networks or individuals]{.underline}, all too often are
[relegated to page A7]{.underline} instead of the front page
[and]{.underline} largely [away from public vision]{.underline}.
However, [**[if]{.mark}** say, **a series of [bombs]{.mark} were
[exploded]{.mark}** paralyzing the financial sector of a major American
city the focus would immediately be apprehended and **the
[eyeballs]{.mark} of** many **Americans [would be glued]{.mark}** to
said attack.]{.underline}

This approach is both normative and theoretical in that it is directed
at a central question: [why do people misconstrue or fail to take
seriously cyber threats?]{.underline} We argue that **[for democracies
to thrive]{.underline}** with well-informed voters making decisions in
their elections and transmit their policy preferences to their elected
leaders. But this [**requires the referential Self to effectively
understand and develop their own identities relative to the national or
effective assessments of threat must be possible**.]{.underline} Placing
OST in the conversation helps us to organize how publics conceive of
their security and organize it into preferential voting behaviors. This
folds in notions of threat and visibility, as well as the presumption
that to properly ascertain how threatening an action may be is entirely
relative to the perception that the problem is something tractable
enough to apprehend, and cognizable enough to properly fold into an
existing structuration of concern. Voters in an overwhelming information
environment may fail to properly aggregate potential threats to their
governments or persons, but this does not mean those threats do not
exists. It only means we (as the public) may fail to properly tabulate
and understand how those threats relate to our lived experience.

[Ontological security theory as a set of practical and empirical
assumptions about state and individual behavior is an important tool for
heuristically constructing how preferences are sorted in an atmosphere
of threat and contestation.]{.underline} Huysmans's (1998) study is
particularly important for this work because it situates how states come
to view internal/external others as threats to the self/identity both in
terms of space and vision. Because, as Huysmans argues, OST is founded
upon relational security practices and the ability to perceive which are
and are not manifest security threats is hotly in contention and is
driven "by 'securitizing' the unknown into an identifiable threat"
(Steele, 2017). The unknown in this case can be typified, though not
flippantly, by the "half a billion cyber security breaches in first
semester of 2014" (Oltramari et al., 2014) or the "16,555
vulnerabilities between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2018" (Syed,
2020). This picture of the cyber horizon is made even more chaotic when
one recognizes that "65% of the victims of intrusion and information
theft in the private sector are notified by third parties and that the
detection process usually takes up to 13 months" (quoted in Syed, 2020).

To effectively evaluate threat in the realm of cyber security means
being able to effectively adjudicate how and where threats occur. For
Huysmans (1998) in the practical realm of OST, this means identifying
the other or securitizing the problematic party. For those in the cyber
security community (computer scientists, data systems managers, and
cyber security analysts) this means creating a common language to
describe threats and to properly allocate culpability. They describe the
problem as "cognizance" or the ability to create a "reliable perception
of the elements of the environment and...the explicit representation of
their semantics" (Syed, 2020, p. 54). The promotion of a shared
conceptualization of chaotic and often covert threat attempts to, "shape
that chaos into a framework of meaningful chunks of knowledge, turning
the operational disarray into a systematic model" that gives
practitioners and theorists purchase on dealing with cyber threats. To
understand cyber is to adapt or adopt a common language to create a
landscape of cyberthreats. Thus, the realm of threat is not hard to
understand as even those closest to the problem are aware that lacking a
basic knowledge of common elements has created chaos. How then are
normal people meant to understand the cyber realm as a position of
threat?

In this regard Kinvall's work is helpful because it organizes the
[terminology and language of threat around a common source of
loss]{.underline}. For example, the election hacking and disinformation
around the 2020 election. Kinvall employed **[[the use of 'chosen
traumas']{.underline}]{.mark}** from (Volkan 1998) which [**are [folded
into]{.mark}** broader **[group identities]{.mark}**.
Defined]{.underline} from here [as the "collective memory of a calamity
that once befell a group's ancestors"]{.underline} (Volkan 1998).
[**[Securitizing the Self]{.mark}**, here it seems' **[requires a
collective trauma]{.mark}**, which in the realm of terrorism is easily
understood. The **[terrorist attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the
Pentagon and World Trade Center, as well as the tragedy of Flight 93,
[on September 11, 2001]{.underline} for example [**[provided]{.mark}** a
necessary site for **collective [trauma]{.mark}** and the
torture]{.underline} (Steele, 2017) **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** then
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** Global **[[War on Terror emerged]{.mark}
as a result]{.underline}** (Updegraff et al., 2008). [**The role of this
trauma in** creating the permission structure for **conflict** and
bloodletting **is manifest in**]{.underline} the recent history of
[American **Foreign Policy**]{.underline} (Resende and Budryte, 2013).
This, as opposed to say election hacking, or the sheer volume of [cyber
threats]{.underline} and conflicts as noted above, [defies the mind to
create known or unknown enemies precisely because vision is deterred and
the necessary creation around anxiety is upended. Political life and the
establishment of norms and routines around threat is dynamic and
shifting, even as the human drive for certainty remains]{.underline}
(Onuf, 1998). Societies are driven by a sense that a coherent picture of
personal security is possible and preferable even if the notion of how
that world outside is created is problematic and fractured. As
researchers we desire things as well, including, a "coherent Self"
(Steele, 2017) but paradoxically these may be those that are most
capable and likely to commit acts of violence (Steele, 2017). Again,
though, this requires a construction of the Self relative to a manifest
threat and a creation of a sphere of safety around a perceived possible
security or insecurity. Krahmann argues that just such a security sphere
exists in the marketing of cyber-security to European Union (EU)
communities. The promotion by the state of anxieties around threat first
appears in notion of terrorism and migration in the EU. But migrates,
one might feel, inevitably, to the realm of cyber security. Krahmann
argues that while "Fear can be addressed by eliminating a threat,
anxiety cannot" (2018: 358).

This is precisely the problem: **[[anxiety without vision is
lost]{.underline}]{.mark}** on voters and policymakers not directly
focused on the issue of cybersecurity. Because the cyber realm is
largely opaque to the outside world and because individuals,
corporations, public utilities, hospitals, or governments who suffer
from cyber attacks often hide these attacks out of shame, embarrassment,
or for security concerns no trauma is effectively transmitted and thus
no concerted popular response is generated.
**[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}** piece [**[is not opining for
another]{.mark}** global **[war on terror,]{.mark}** nor is it seeking
some sight of popular trauma to serve as a benchmark for the dangers of
cyber warfare,]{.underline} what it is fundamentally concerned about is
the dramatic uptick in cyberattacks (the Russian attack on the
Ukrainian2 and Georgian3 power grids, the ongoing Solar Winds hacks4 ,
the Russian theft of State Department emails5 , or the constant barrage
of Chinese attempts to obtain intellectual property6 ) and the failure
of the public to cognize that there are no redlines in cyber.

Other than the ICANN framework7 which is at this point not codified into
international law or recognized by the UN, there are no established
rules of the road, proportionate responses in terms of Just War Theory,
or mitigative efforts short of backroom diplomacy. [**What [a just
response to an attack]{.mark}** on a power grid or to the targeting of
nuclear enrichment **[is]{.mark}** often **[made on the fly among a
close network of parties in the know]{.mark}**, [without]{.mark} the
**[overview of policy makers or voters]{.mark}**. This is a highly
combustible situation, and it is made all the more dangerous by the
potential for miscalculations, made broadly out of the view of the
voting public, to result in magnified or outsized results.]{.underline}

**State action can be good for people with disabilities -- ADA proves**

Disabilities Act transformed a country,\" History,
<https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/americans-disabilities-act-transformed-united-states>
) //RB

[More than 2,000 disability rights advocates gathered on the South Lawn
of the White House in Washington, D.C., on a hot summer day. It was July
26, 1990, and they'd come together to witness one of the most momentous
civil rights victories in decades: President George H.W. Bush signing
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) into law.]{.underline}

During the signing ceremony---days after the Fourth of July---[Bush
admitted that the United States hadn't always lived up to its founding
principles of freedom and equality. "\[T\]ragically, for too many
Americans, the blessings of liberty have been limited or even denied,"
he said. "Today's legislation brings us closer to that day when no
Americans will ever again be deprived of their basic guarantee of life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."]{.underline}

**[[The ADA not only provided comprehensive civil rights protections for
people with disabilities for the first time in the nation's
history]{.mark}, but it also [marked a sea change in the nation's
attitudes toward disability rights]{.mark}. Here's how the landmark
statute came to be, and how it transformed the country.]{.underline}**

The disability rights movement gains steam

Throughout history, people with disabilities were feared and ridiculed
for their perceived defects and pushed to the margins of society. By the
1960s, that discrimination had been codified. People with disabilities
were excluded from public schools, involuntarily sterilized, sent to
live in state-run institutions, and even denied the right to vote. Some
U.S. municipalities even had so-called "ugly laws" prohibiting people
with "unsightly or disgusting" deformities in public places. It was a
world designed not to include people with disabilities. Government
buildings and private businesses alike lacked ramps and elevators, while
public transportation rarely provided accommodations for people with
mobility or visual impairments. Having a disability was considered a
medical problem to be solved rather than an identity to be protected
under non-discrimination laws. But things began to change in the 1970s.
Inspired by the civil rights movement of the 1960s, disability rights
advocates became more vocal in their demands that their rights ought to
be guaranteed as well. Disability had also become more noticeable as
wars in Vietnam and Korea returned thousands of soldiers with lasting
injuries. In 1973, advocates won the passage of Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act, which prohibited programs receiving federal funding
from discriminating against people with disabilities. It was the first
piece of legislation to use the term "discrimination" to describe the
limitations that these Americans face.

[For the law to go into effect, the government would have to issue
regulations defining who qualifies as a person with a disability and
what constitutes discrimination in the disability context]{.underline}.
The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare put off issuing those
regulations for four years as they wrestled over the terms. Impatient
with the delay---and worried it meant the regulations would be
weakened---advocates organized protests around the country. [In April
1977 they launched a sit-in at a federal building in San Francisco that
would last for 28 days---the longest peaceful occupation of a federal
building in U.S. history---and **result in victory**.]{.underline}

The need for a comprehensive civil rights law

[With Section 504, the American public began to understand that making
accommodations for people with disabilities was a civil right rather
than a welfare benefit.]{.underline} It also galvanized a growing
disability rights movement that won several other important victories in
the 1970s and 1980s---including legislation that guaranteed a free
public education to children with impairments and prohibited housing
discrimination on the basis of disabilities. Yet discrimination
persisted. In 1979, the Supreme Court ruled that the nursing school at
Southeastern Community College in Whiteville, North Carolina, was not
required by Section 504 to accommodate a hearing-impaired applicant. In
other circumstances, regulations were simply not well enforced. For
example, transit authorities were left to decide for themselves how
accessible they needed to be. (A skull discovered in Spain suggests that
early humans cared for disabled children.) In the mid-1980s, advocates
came to the conclusion that the critical next step was to push for
comprehensive civil rights legislation for people with disabilities. The
National Council on Disability commissioned a report on the need for
such a law, while its vice chair Justin Dart---who would later become
known as the "Godfather of the ADA"---embarked on a national tour to
discuss disability policy with local officials and gather stories of the
discrimination people with disabilities faced. These advocacy efforts
made an impression on both sides of the political aisle. Disability
rights had become a bipartisan issue thanks to years of changing public
perceptions. In 1988, Senators Lowell Weicker, a Republican from
Connecticut, and Tom Harkin, a Democrat from Iowa, introduced the
Americans with Disabilities Act. After years of revisions, amendments,
and negotiations, the bill was passed, and on that July day Bush---who
had made civil rights legislation for people with disabilities a
campaign promise in 1988---signed it into law with Dart by his side.

[Why the [ADA]{.mark} matters]{.underline}

[The Americans with Disabilities Act was a [sweeping piece of
legislation]{.mark} that [banned]{.mark} [discrimination]{.mark} on the
[basis]{.mark} of [disability]{.mark} in employment, public
accommodations, public services, transportation, and
telecommunication]{.underline}. It finally afforded people with
disabilities the same protections that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had
provided on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national
origin.

\"**[It [is the world's first declaration of equality for people with
disabilities]{.mark},\"]{.underline}** [Dart wrote after the ADA was
passed. \"[It will proclaim to America and to the world that people with
disabilities are fully human;]{.mark} that paternalistic,
discriminatory, segregationist attitudes are no longer acceptable; and
that henceforth people with disabilities must be accorded the same
personal respect and the same social and economic opportunities as other
people.\"]{.underline}

[The [ADA]{.mark} [launched]{.mark} the process of [building a more
accessible world by ensuring that buildings, schools, and public spaces
were equipped with ramps, elevators, and curb cuts.]{.mark}]{.underline}
It [made travel easier by requiring operators to make accommodations,
such as offering wheelchair lifts, airport shuttle service, and rental
cars with hand controls. It also led to the rise of interpreters and
closed captioning in public communications. (These five coastal areas
have made accessibility a priority.)]{.underline}

[Crucially, this [legislation has also become a model for lawmakers and
activists]{.mark} around the world seeking [to end
discrimination]{.mark} against people with disabilities in their
countries. Since 2000, more than 180 countries have passed legislation
inspired by the ADA.]{.underline} The law is limited, however. The ADA
has been criticized for failing to increase employment among people with
disabilities---only 19 percent are in the workforce today compared with
66 percent of those without disabilities. People with disabilities are
still disenfranchised. Accommodations at polling places across the
nation are inadequate; in 2016, a government report found that 60
percent of the polling places it examined had one or more potential
impediments, such as ramps that were dangerously steep or paths in poor
condition. Meanwhile, 39 states and Washington, D.C., have incompetence
laws that allow judges to strip the vote from people they deem incapable
of participating in the democratic process, such as people with mental
impairments. Stigma and discrimination persist throughout society too.
The ADA may not be perfect, but as Dart wrote in 1990, it "is only the
beginning. It is not a solution. Rather, it is an essential foundation
on which solutions will be constructed."

bigotry, evaluative chauvinism, and structural injustice that people

With this articulation of the injustices suffered by people with
disabilities, the Pentecostal disability theologian Amos Yong channels
the zeitgeist, a widely shared sensibility about how equality is to be
achieved. The contemporary version of this Enlightenment **[[quest to
achieve justice]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- understood **[[as universal
equality]{.mark} -- [takes]{.mark}]{.underline}** the form of a hunt
**[[to root out]{.underline}]{.mark}** all pernicious -isms: not only
**[[racism, ableism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, evaluative chauvinism but
also patriarchalism, heterosexism **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** gender
**[[essentialism.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Put in the terms of this
special issue, it is almost universally assumed in the modern democratic
liberal space that when we (late-modern westerners) ask whether
disability is a 'driving force for change,' we understand change as a
process progressive of eliminating injustices. This paper probes the
limits and blind spots of moral change so defined in order to raise one
theological note of caution. Understanding moral change in progressivist
terms carries a momentum -- psychological and linguistically embedded --
that that can carry the moral drive for justice into a superficial and
so problematic **[[policing of language]{.mark} that [can become
unmoored from]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[more concrete work
of]{.mark} [investigating]{.mark}]{.underline}** the mechanics of
**[[specific forms of lived justice.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It is
important to ask whether it is possible that well-meaning quests for
justice can take forms that are idolatrous because
**[[they]{.underline}]{.mark}** in fact **[[excuse people from making
real]{.underline}]{.mark}** and costly **[[concrete ventures to serve
lived, actual justice.]{.underline}]{.mark}** When Yong highlights
ableism as idolatrous, he rightly draws attention to an important set of
injustices, and in a way that makes common cause with people of all
faiths and none who find ableism morally repugnant. The question I want
to ask is whether saying something is idolatry (a theological
description) is wholly equivalent to saying that it is a pernicious
'ism' (a linguistic and moral description). This distinction matters
because one fights idolatry primarily by confession and repentance,
whereas the common **[[liberal understanding]{.underline}]{.mark}** is
that one **[[fights bias and prejudice by education and institutional
reform.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Yong holds these two sorts of response
together by marrying idolatry and ableism, but it may be that the list
of aspects of ableism that he lists ('discriminatory attitudes, negative
stereotypes, and sociopolitical and economic structures and
institutions') are very differently understood if taken to be signs of
worship of a false power rather than as **[[institutional
structures]{.underline}]{.mark}** and mental attitudes which
[**[make]{.underline}** **[life harder for]{.underline}**]{.mark} some
**[[people]{.underline}]{.mark}** than others[.]{.mark} There may well
be forms of being educated about discrimination which exacerbate the
spiritual pride that assumes people do not really need to change. If so,
it is important to ask what is lost if we simply equate the very
different descriptive registers of idolatry and discrimination. These
questions matter if **[[the final aim of justice is effective social
change. It is dangerous to assume that linguistic change alone can do
this]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a claim Yong would certainly reject. No one
should doubt that we often find our way to real injustices by querying
the behaviour of people who speak disparagingly of others, in this case,
those with disabilities. **[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}** it is crucial
not to lose **[[the]{.mark} [question]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[how]{.mark}]{.underline}** successful or
**[[unsuccessful]{.underline}]{.mark}** the work of **[[rooting out
discriminatory linguistic expressions]{.mark} [has been in
achieving]{.mark}]{.underline}** changes to **[[unjust practices on the
ground.]{.underline}]{.mark}** There are very practical differences in
what it takes to combat 'discriminatory attitudes and negative
stereotypes' in contrast to changing 'sociopolitical and economic
structures and institutions.' If we call both sorts of work 'combatting
ableism' we are lumping together very different sorts of activity, from
the crafting of policy, to the analysis of cultural tropes to the
revising of formulaic public speech to the investigation of people's own
identity structures. Distinguishing idolatry and discrimination
Distinguishing between idolatry and discrimination matters because
**[[real change demands]{.underline}]{.mark}** self-examination and
repentance. It also **[[demands personal investment
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** a very different sort of work, sociological
research, **[[policy formulation, legal clarification, engagement in the
political process, forging alliances between different power blocks, and
so on.]{.mark} [It]{.mark}]{.underline}** will

[what]{.mark} [we]{.mark}]{.underline}** might **[[concretely do about
it]{.underline}]{.mark}** if we are serious about bringing about a
genuinely more just society**[[?]{.underline}]{.mark}** The modern
liberal quest to root out -isms can sometimes proceed in ways that make
it difficult to see if these investigative questions are being seriously
asked. Language policing undermines its own moral authority if this more
concrete and fine-grained analysis is not obviously being pursued. For
example, since the police killing of George Floyd in 2020 there has been
an exponential rise in interest in rooting out racial bias among
American white liberals. Yet despite this increase in intellectual
comprehension of the implications of white privilege, those who think of
themselves as white might still buy houses in places where they know
racism gives them an unfair economic advantage, not challenge racism
among family members and find reasons to resist sharing schools. Given
the structural inequalities involved in racism and the personal costs of
remaking these infrastructural barriers, crafting a 'woke' online
profile and voting for progressive causes may seem like a reasonable and
low-cost way of being an ally of victims of racial injustice while in
fact being one of the more stable ways that racism is
perpetuated.[2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1474225X.2022.2038017)
As early as 1965 Martin Luther King himself had highlighted this dynamic
in the American populace. The 'silence of friends' he pointed out, is a
longstanding feature of American racism, and is held in place as the
majority of enlightened liberals denounce racism elsewhere but explain
it away in their own back yards, where admitting it would demand costly
change. As he put it in 1967: 'most whites in America, including many of
goodwill, proceed from the premise that equality is a loose expression
for improvement. White America is not even psychologically organized to
close the gap -- essentially, it seeks only to make it less painful and
less obvious but in most respects retain
it.'[3](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1474225X.2022.2038017)
Stated philosophically: the danger of calling a concrete injustice,
against disabled people, for instance, an 'ism' -- in this case,
ableism, is to insinuate that the basic motor of justice is our work of
classifying new sets of language and thought as pernicious -isms. The
illusion is that moral change in society is essentially driven by the
reclassification of specific acts from being morally neutral, to being
morally problematic. Once something has been labelled a problematic -ism
it is then subsumed within a general class of illiberal -isms that those
who want to achieve a just society must now fight to eradicate or defend
themselves from accusations of being morally suspect. But as the case of
racism makes clear, this linguistic reclassification can blind us to our
own culpability if we are not able to name concrete ways in which we are
participants in ableism. Those who have become content to denounce
unjust -isms can often be spotted by the ease with which they compare
and implicitly equate injustices. **[[People who have developed the
habit of verbally denouncing unjust -isms often find it hard to explain
the details of concrete injustices.]{.underline}]{.mark}** There is a
symmetry between the equation of injustices and the superficiality of
one's emotional and intellectual engagement with them. For instance: are
the indubitable injustices associated with the labels racism and ableism
in fact morally or phenomenologically equivalent? There are a wide range
of questions that would need to be asked here to even begin to answer
the question of what it would mean to stamp out these two -isms. Is the
racism of one society equivalent to that of all others? In a society
that had chattel slavery in living memory, should we prioritise the
fight to eradicate racism, or should we acknowledge that disabled people
have been disparaged and mocked for most of human history, and so
deserve to receive priority in formulating our campaigns for justice and
our calls for better social policies? Should we even ask whether some
injustices are more severe than others? If we cannot ask this question,
how will we focus our efforts in fighting injustice? I am not taking a
position on any of these questions, but raise them in order to highlight
how the classing of all injustices under labels that appear to set
injustices in a single conceptual cluster may produce false equivalences
that make it difficult to investigate and admit morally important
differences between disparaging language and actually enacted
injustices.

costly to install a ramp, or the community lecture that excludes deaf
attendees by refusing to hire a sign-language interpreter.) Instead of
facilitating change, false unity actually restrains change. It stifles
the more substantive conversations true progress requires. And our

shows how the politics of disability is in this sense non-political. We
are the worse for it. [In addition to greater participation in the

human relations are inherently antagonistic: Political change always
requires controversial transfers in power or prestige, and it is an
illusion to imagine politics without confrontation. Per this "agonistic"
conception of democracy, a healthy political order is one that prefers
vigorous, good-faith argumentation to complacent consensus. Until we
publicly recognize real disagreements surrounding disability and
accessibility, Mouffe would insist, we are doomed to a vacuous, empty
debate that is neither political nor productive. Recall the Kovaleski
incident. I'm not suggesting that the abhorrence of Mr. Trump's actions
is open to legitimate questioning. But [in their forcefully reassuring

[[there was no substantive public discussion]{.mark} of such

might be; it avoids the drama and messiness that now seem to define our
common life. Avoiding politics might be possible if
[[disability]{.underline}]{.mark} were an exclusively private affair.

Afterword: Done with the Drive?

Four years into writing about the disability drive, and three days
before this dissertation is due, I have a thought: [**maybe [it's time
to be done with the drive]{.mark}. [That]{.mark}** thought, of course,
**[contradicts everything I have written]{.mark} in this
thesis:**]{.underline} [one does not get done with the drive, check it
off a to-do list, and go on to do other things.]{.underline} [**[The
disability drive is unmasterable]{.mark}**; it is a force that cannot be
overcome.]{.underline} [Much as one might want to be done with the
drive, the drive, it seems, [is never done undoing
us]{.mark}.]{.underline} Worse (or perhaps better), although we may say
that we want the disability drive to stop its self-rupturings,
[[the]{.mark} very [notion of "wanting" is]{.mark} fundamentally
[destabilized by the drive]{.mark}, a compulsion that pushes us beyond
pleasure and beyond desire, forcing us to wonder exactly what those
concepts mean.]{.underline} [The drive goes, does, and
undoes.]{.underline} Recall the words of Jacques Alain Miller: "The
drive...always has its keys in hand." This line stays with me; whenever
I drop something (for example, my keys), it repeats in my mind.

Always with its keys in hand, the drive pushes this project to go
further. Among the most pressing questions now driving my inquiry are
Jewish ones. In the previous chapter, I critiqued the ways in which
Freud‟s developmental model of sexuality, reliant upon the theory that
ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, reinforces racialized social
hierarchies. Yet we can't label Freud as racist---or even dub him a
"dead white European man"---and leave it at that. For in the context of
the early twentieth century, Freud was not exactly European, and he was
not exactly white. In the preface to the Hebrew translation of Totem and
Taboo, Freud‟s anthropological analysis of people to whom he refers as
"savages," Freud distances himself from his Jewishness (noting his
ignorance of "the language of holy writ" and his estrangement from "the
religion of his fathers") but nevertheless emphasizes that he "has yet
never repudiated his people" (4, xxxi). Avowing that he "feels that he
is in his essential nature a Jew," Freud writes that he "has no desire
to alter that nature" (xxxi). What is this essential nature? Freud
cannot express the essence of Jewishness "clearly in words; but some
day, no doubt, it will become accessible to the scientific mind" (xxxi).

Freud made these remarks in December of 1930, an era in which so-called
scientific minds were attempting to pin down, and to eradicate, whatever
that essence of being a Jew might be. Before the end of that decade, the
Nazi invasion of Austria forced Freud to flee Vienna; he spent the final
year of his life in London. Although Freud could not have known about
the genocide to come, the threat of anti-Semitic violence forms a
crucial part of the historical context in which he developed his concept
of the death drive. "A Jew awaiting a pogrom": that haunting line in
Civilization and Its Discontents, a text published in 1933, is offered
by Freud as an example of the impossibility of imagining what it is like
to endure extreme suffering (62). The image is quickly left behind ("It
seems to me unprofitable to pursue this aspect of the problem any
further," Freud writes), but it invokes questions that keep coming. Most
saliently: why? "The Disability Drive" has perhaps taken us in the
direction of this impossible question. My project's central claim is
that repressing the drive leads to violence. [Hostility toward disabled
people, women, fat people, racialized others, poor and working-class
people, and queers has been the focus of my analysis.]{.underline} My
future work will take these inquiries further, asking about the drive's
relation to systemic racial violence.

In doing so, I will ask: **[[when the drive]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as
repressed, [**[keeps]{.underline}** **[returning, what does this
do?]{.underline}**]{.mark} As we saw in Chapter 1, Freud raised this
question at the beginning of Beyond the Pleasure Principle. Why, he
wondered, did [traumatized soldiers]{.underline} repeatedly return to
the scenes of violence that had made them ill? Building on Freud's
theorization of [**[the drive]{.mark}** as an aspect of the
psyche]{.underline} that **[[may help the organism sustain
trauma]{.underline}]{.mark}**, I will ask whether theorizing the
disability drive as a way of living through, or with, trauma might lead
to deeper understandings of lived experiences of, and social reactions
to, mental and physical disabilities that are brought on by trauma.

What connections exist between trauma and tragedy? In Chapter 2, I
argued that [[disability scholars]{.mark} might productively [reclaim
the trope of "the tragedy]{.mark} of disability." This
phrase]{.underline}, I suggested, [calls up not only the colloquial
signification of tragedy]{.underline} (as devastating loss or pointless
suffering) [but also the term‟s generic denotation]{.underline}. Further
exploring the relation between the disability drive and the genre of
tragedy will open up questions about the status of literature in
cultural analyses of the disability drive. I have performed literary
readings in this dissertation because **[[the drive, an unrepresentable
force, can come to us only by means of the
figural]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For this reason, literary texts provide
particularly rich sources for theorizing the complexities and the
obliquities of the drive. But at the same time, I have sought to
destabilize binaries between literary and nonliterary texts. By
highlighting Freud‟s linguistic choices in his medical case history
Dora; by analyzing Charles Dickens‟s and Lee Edelman‟s respective
portrayals of the character of Tiny Tim as both literary and political
productions; and by juxtaposing Freud‟s model of sexual development,
Jane Austen‟s depictions of fatness and eating, and contemporary US
American culture‟s citations of the figure of the compulsive eater, I
have drawn attention to the ways in which [the literary and the
ideological structure, and are structured by, each other]{.underline}.
In doing so, my intention has not been to use the political to master
the literary, or to employ the literary to exert control over the
political; instead, I have hoped to provoke and sustain potentially
jarring confrontations between the two.

Such confrontations can produce experiences of epistemological
disablement, rendering readers of cultural texts uncertain as to what
counts as literature, what counts as politics, and to what extent such
divides can be upheld. As we discussed in Chapter 1, epistemological
disablement can be an effect of coming into contact with the disability
drive. Stimulating uncertainties and doubts, the disability drive may
disable us all; yet this ubiquitous psychic disablement also
specifically evokes particular aspects of many disabled people‟s lived
experiences. [[Disabled people live ongoing contradictions between our
embodied realities and]{.mark} the [structure of overcoming
narratives]{.mark}, stories that are presented to us not as fictions but
as normative prescriptions.]{.underline} [We feel the effects of the
drive when we suffer the breakages and breakdowns that occur when
bodymind and overcoming narrative]{.underline} (the weight loss diet,
the getting better with exercise and meditation, or even the claiming of
a proud disability consciousness) clash and contradict---and when, for
worse or for better, some parts of our selves like these crashes. In
Chapter 2, I said that sometimes, despite our selves, we do like the
disability toward which we are driven. **[But [when it comes to the
drive]{.mark}, perhaps [it does not matter much whether we do, or don‟t,
think that we like it.]{.mark} Either way, the drive is not done undoing
us.]{.underline}**

It undoes us through pity, we saw in Chapter 3. [That affect that
self-respecting crips are supposed to shun, I argued, could instead be
conceived as a feeling that we might wish to solicit. If pity is
regarded as a feminizing emotion, and if the abjection of pity has been
effected through the culture‟s use of Tiny Tim as a trope not only for
disability‟s pitiability]{.underline} but also, obliquely, for the
clitoris as sign for an intrinsic feminine disability, then perhaps we
should reconsider the impetus to take Tiny Tim out of the cultural text.
We could take our analysis of pity further by asking whether primary
pity---which I defined as a concept that lies on the threshold between,
on the one hand, the complete erasure of the concepts of "self" and
"other" that characterizes primary narcissism and, on the other hand,
the solidification of the self in which secondary narcissism is
grounded---could be conceived as a quintessentially queercrip concept.
My concept of primary pity is construable as "queer" because its
unsettling of the categories of self and other poses a threat to
identity formations. At the same time, the concept is readable as "crip"
because, insofar as it maintains an attachment to the construction of
the self, it is indebted to the disability rights movement‟s claiming of
"crip" as a politically subversive identity. My queer cripping (or crip
queering) of primary pity will thus draw on the interventions in queer
theory and disability studies that I made in Chapter 1: it will depart
from queer theory‟s strategy of claiming postidentitarianism as a
transcendent solution to the disabling effects of claiming, and being
claimed by, culturally minoritized identities; and it will
simultaneously challenge disability studies‟ positing of proud,
nonsuffering crip identities as foundational to political activism.

**[Questions about [activism]{.mark} press us further, too. [In]{.mark}
using the lenses of [psychoanalysis and literary theory]{.mark} to
delineate aspects [of]{.mark} the [cultural]{.mark} [politics]{.mark} of
disability, I [have not laid out a guideline or program for resisting
ableist social structures]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I have sought instead
to show how developing an understanding of the disability drive---and,
in particular, attending to the violences that result from individuals‟
and cultures‟ misrecognitions of the drive---may facilitate
transformations in how we conceive of our subjectivities. Such
transformations, deeply indebted to the feminist maxim that the personal
is political, are not individual solutions akin to the overcoming
narrative. Rather, by changing how we understand our "insides," we may
contribute to changing the ways that, "outside," on the level of the
social, we relate to each other. As we saw in Chapter 4, [something as
seemingly personal as an individual‟s "relationship to food" can raise
vexing questions that, when we deny that within ourselves that drives
these questions, become the basis of damaging social structures of
fatphobia, racism, classism, misogyny, and anti-queer
prejudice.]{.underline}

**[[If the drive won't stop]{.mark} doing us, [is it]{.mark} possible
that we can allow it to do us differently?]{.underline}** In the last
paragraph of this dissertation, on the day that it is due, I feel as if
I should leave you with a message to take home: [**perhaps a user‟s
guide to the drive, a method for learning [to love this thing]{.mark}
that won‟t leave us**. If I were a queer antisocial theorist, I might
propose that we shout out, loud and proud, something like this: "We‟re
here! We‟re queer! We are the drive! And you‟ll never get used to us!"
But **[such a call]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} we saw in Chapter 1,
[**[performs a fantasy of overcoming]{.mark}** the drive **[by
identifying]{.mark}** with it]{.underline} (if you can‟t beat it, join
it); [and **[the drive is not a force that can be
overcome]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Were I to articulate my own version of
a saying evoking the feeling of the drive, it would go more like this:
"Come on; we‟re late; let‟s go---oh no, where are my keys!?" To be
clear, I am the last person who should offer advice about handling the
loss of one‟s keys. I [know the recommendations---stay calm; breathe;
retrace your steps---but rarely do I heed them. For me, it‟s closer to:
Panic! Berate self! Look for someone to blame! I have no guide for
getting over this set of reactions, but I do want to say
this:]{.underline} "The Disability Drive" has been an invitation to
think collectively about the ways that, when we feel we cannot bear the
psychic or social equivalents of losing our keys (keys potentially
serving as metaphors for other objects, the loss of which might be more
devastating), the impetus to blame someone else can harden into a fixed
idea, a truth that one refuses to relinquish. We have analyzed multiple
examples of this process: fat people stigmatized as "compulsive eaters,"
feminists caricatured as anti-sex identitarians, and chronically ill
people dismissed as "hysterical." **[[If this dissertation has a moral,
it is this: the intolerable feeling that arises when we lose keys,
control, or other objects that we think we need in order to believe in
our selves, originates not from outside us but from within]{.mark}. This
is the drive: it always has its keys in hand. [We are not done with the
drive]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

For instance, what at first glance seems merely naïve―that is **[the
observation that in the U.S. "\[b\]eing disabled is just like being
black"―actually does index how disability cannot be synonymous with
Whiteness.]{.underline}** For what is suggested through the forced
parity between the construction of blackness and disability is that the
disabled body or mind cannot properly embody Whiteness in toto. And that
is what Anna Stubblefield demonstrates in "'Beyond the Pale': Tainted
Whiteness, Cognitive Disability and Eugenic Sterilization," which
iterates how disabled white persons have historically been categorized
as embodying a tainted form of whiteness. She convincingly argues that
beginning from the 1800s in the U.S. those who were considered
feebleminded, a form of cognitive disability, lost the full privileges
attendant with white citizenship. As she writes, "... to grasp
feeblemindedness fully as a signifier of tainted whiteness, it is
important to understand that the state-sponsored, involuntary
sterilization of tainted whites meant that they had, in effect, lost the
full protection that whiteness conferred in a white supremacist society"
(178; emphasis added). Not only did the so-called feebleminded whites
come to embody a compromised form of whiteness but also the " ... white
men \[and women\] labeled as criminal, sexually deviate, homosexual, ...
or insane ... " (Stubblefield 178). What Stubblefield emphasizes is that
**[[disability as a social construct cannot easily be detached from its
imbricated positioning within a network of material forces that include
not only race but sexuality, class, and gender.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Her study foregrounds **[the need for Disability studies to attend to
racialization as not a tangential focus but central to its overall
theoretical and political project.]{.underline}** Interestingly
Stubblefield's study of how disability can dispossess whites of their
"full personhood" under U.S. law seemingly lends support to what
"Dismodernism" authorizes, which is **[the idea that the suffering of
blacks can be made equivalent to not only what disabled whites come to
embody but also to all those other Others represented under the category
of "people of color." In short, [disability has the potential to
democratize civil society by recalling how all citizens are common in
their humanity―that is, equally exposed to
disability.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Yet, if we read between the lines of
Stubblefield's summary of how "feebleminded whites" can become
"tainted," the singularity of "blackness's grammar of suffering"
emerges. For **[[what distinguishes "blackness grammar of suffering" is
how it does not operate according to the assumptive logic of
capability]{.mark}. In other words, to approach "blackness's grammar of
suffering," Wilderson insists that one must be able to imagine "an
ethicality ... so terrifying that, as a space to be inhabited and terror
to be embraced" (41), it resists language. It is a "grammar of
suffering" based not upon the logic of a "lost" capacity but that of a
deontologized property, the Slave that is not "exploited and alienated"
but rather "accumulated and fungible." [The effect of this singular
grammar on]{.mark} Asian American and [Disability studies is
significant, but the impact of Wilderson's]{.mark} critique on the
"scholarly and aesthetic production" of the "Black theorist" [is
radical]{.mark} by comparison.]{.underline}** As he writes: This
\["blackness's grammar suffering"\] makes the labor of disavowal in
Black scholarly and aesthetic production doubly burdensome, for it is
triggered by a dread of both being 'discovered,' and of discovering
oneself, as ontological incapacity. Thus, through borrowed
institutionality―the feigned capacity to be essentially exploited and
alienated (rather than accumulated and fungible) in the first
ontological instance (in other words, a fantasy to be just like everyone
else, which is a fantasy to be)―the work of Black film theory \[and by
extension Black studies\] operates through a myriad of compensatory
gestures in which the Black theorists assumes subjective capacity to be
universal and thus 'finds' it everywhere. (42) Placed within the frame
of "blackness's grammar of suffering," I want to examine the
consequences of Davis's attempt to render disability cosmopolitan. While
the move has the virtual effect of equalizing all bodies around human
capacity to suffer―such an ethical cum political strategy requires the
disavowal of how concepts such as "human" and "civil society" in the
U.S. have structurally depended on the production of social death, i.e.
the Black (and the Red). As it should be obvious by now, what **[is
therefore unthinkable in Davis's attempt to make civil society cohere
around the universality of human suffering is the contingent nature of
the term human itself.]{.underline}** This in fact is what Bells intuits
but cannot name in his influential essay entitled "Introducing White
Disability Studies: A Modest Proposal." Bell's hesitation is partly
attributable to how pain or suffering is both social (that is
communicable, sharable by all humans in equal measure) and
incommunicable within Disability studies. That is, **[[Disability
studies' uneven attention to the incommunicability of suffering is
seemingly capable of accommodating the unrepresentability that is
constituent of "blackness's grammar of
suffering."]{.underline}]{.mark}** As Siebers insists,
"\[i\]ndividuality derived from the incommunicability of pain easily
enforces a myth of hyperindividuality, a sense that each individual is
locked in solitary confinement where suffering is the only object of
contemplation. People with disabilities are already too politically
isolated for this myth to be attractive" (176). Yet in an attempt to
intervene in the poststructuralist tendency to idealize "physical pain"
as site of either transcendent power or pleasure, Siebers also adds,
"... \[p\]hysical pain is \[at once\] highly individualistic,
unpredictable, and raw as reality. Pain is not a resource of political
change. It is not a well of delight for the individual" (178). What is
directly pertinent to the present essay is how the universal figure of
the "individual"- human marks the critical horizon of Disability theory.
Or, to put a finer point to it via Widerson's reading of Frantz Fanon's
Black Skin, White Mask, "... the Negro ... 'is comparison,' nothing more
and certainly nothing less, for what is less than comparison? ... \[And
as such\] 'No one knows yet who \[the Negro\] is, but he knows that fear
will fill the world when the world finds out'" (42). We find in the most
sophisticated Asian Americanist deployment of poststructuralist
strategies of reading―such as the one advanced in the influential work
by Kandice Chuh―a similar call to abandon politics based on social
identity.6 While I am in agreement with both Davis's and Chuh's
overarching critique of uniform identity, I find troubling their
wholesale critique of all identity formation as a priori essentialist.
For such framing of social identity as necessarily restrictive can only
lead to the return of the repressed in our present era of
colorblindness―the ideal of abstract citizenship. As she writes:
"**['Asian American' ... connotes the violence]{.underline}**,
exclusion, dislocation, and disenfranchisement that has **[attended the
codification of certain bodies]{.underline}** as variously, Oriental,
yellow, sometimes brown, inscrutable, devious, always alien. It speaks
to the active denial of personhood to the individuals inhabiting those
bodies" (Chuh 27). In this, **[Chuh]{.underline}**―along with Davis and
Siebers―unwittingly **[announces the displacement and the erasure of
"blackness's grammar of suffering,"]{.underline}** as their strategies
of reading the presence or absence of justice within U.S. civil society
is predicated upon exploitation and alienation of the a priori human
subject. Nevertheless, by embodying the self―Disability studies helps to
shift (though only slightly) critical theory toward an alternative
ethicality that does not programmatically endorse the idea and ideals of
abstract citizenship. For contrary to the liberal model of the political
subject that achieves "hyperindividuality" through social and material
detachment, the alternative model of subjectivity that is afforded
through the disabled body is a self that is always already in the
process of negotiating complex relations to the materiality of the
social. Thus, the embodied model of subjectivity helps to re-imagine
"personhood" as relation itself, leading not to the reification or
essentialization of self, this relational model of subjectivity demands
that any identity whatsoever be thought not as autonomous substance but
rather as a site, comprising of unfinished, mobile, heterogeneously
constituted relations across an embodied hermeneutic horizon. It bears
mentioning here that it is this interconnected and radically open vision
of "personhood" as relation that is foreclosed in the liberal model of
abstract citizenship. For in the liberal model of the self, the ideal is
to attain singular indeterminacy through the negation of such social
relations, without which no self can hope to attain intelligibility. As
Alcoff's important work suggests: Social identities ... are more
properly understood as sites from which we perceive, act, and engage
with others. These sites are not simply locations or positions, but also
hermeneutic horizons comprised of experiences, basic beliefs, and
communal values \[...\] . We are not boxed in by them, constrained,
restricted, or held captive―unless ... it makes sense to say that we are
boxed in by the fact that we have bodies . ... (287) Interestingly **[it
is by [attending to how the self is embodied]{.mark} and embedded [in
social reality]{.mark} that [clarifies the radical singularity of the
Black's structural non-relationality]{.mark}, which in turn helps to
bring into focus not only what Wilderson calls the "structural
antagonisms" that contour U.S. civil society but also unexplored
ethico-political limits and possibilities of sub-fields such as
Disability and Asian American studies.]{.underline}** For according to
Wilderson's Red, White & Black what gives internal coherence to such
terms as "human" and "civil society" in the U.S. is the disavowal of the
structural (historical) relation blacks have with what is essentially
non-human, a form of social death known as slavery. As he summarizes:
During the emergence of new ontological relations in the modern world,
from the late Middle Ages through the 1500s, many different kinds of
people experienced slavery. ... But African, or more precisely
**[Blackness, refers to an individual who is by definition always
already void of relationality. Thus modernity marks the emergence of a
new ontology because it is an era in which an entire race appears,
people who, a priori, that is prior to the contingency of the
'transgressive act']{.underline}** (such as losing a war or being
convicted of a crime), **[stand as socially dead in relation to the rest
of the world.]{.underline}** (17-8) Wilderson's intervention therefore
hinges on isolating and exposing this dual operation by which civil
society makes sense of itself to itself―the simultaneous disavowal of
and parasitic dependency on the Black. In other words, **[[the desire to
make blackness an analogue of disability amounts to denying the
structural relevancy of slavery to the formation of U.S. civil
society.]{.mark} Wilderson's reading of Fanon helps to articulate the
radical singularity of "blackness's grammar of suffering," as it
emphasizes how "... the gratuitous violence of the Black's first
ontological instance, the Middle Passage, 'wiped out \[his or her\]
metaphysics ... his \[or her\] customs and sources on which they are
based.' [Jews went into Auschwitz and came out as Jews. Africans went
into the ships and came out as Blacks"]{.mark} (38). What Wilderson
calls the ["blackness's grammar of suffering,"]{.mark} consequently,
[has no analogue]{.mark} in either the assumptive figure of the
"individual" [that subtends Disability studies]{.mark} and those other
Others within U.S. civil society that have become included within the
frame known as "people of color." In this, "blackness's grammar of
suffering" gestures toward what is unnamable, a form of suffering that
is in excess of any ethical language which is based upon the universal
figure of the human. This is how Wilderson radically undermines the
desire to transpose "blackness's grammar of suffering" into the
ethico-political language upon which civil society's depends to make
suffering (physical, psychic or otherwise) intelligible.]{.underline}**
As he writes: The ruse of analogy erroneously locates Blacks in the
world―a place where they have not been since the dawn of Blackness. This
attempt to position the Black in the world by way of analogy is not only
a mystification, and often erasure, of Blackness's grammar of suffering
(accumulation and fungibility or the status of being non-Human) but
simultaneously also a provision for civil society, promising an enabling
modality for Human ethical dilemmas. It is a mystification and an
erasure because ... their grammars of suffering are irreconcilable. (37)
Such is the logic that animates Bell's critique of Disability studies
but it does not, cannot obtain the force of Wilderson's intervention
because Bell cannot or dare not disarticulate the Black from the world.
Nevertheless both Wilderson and Bell help foreground the important fact
that even suffering obtains a "grammar," that is, has a way of
indexing―whether positively in the form of identification or negatively
through dis- or even through non-identification, the presence or absence
of a world. What Bell's and especially Wilderson's critique bring into
sharp relief is that anti-blackness is part and parcel of the episteme
that gives internal coherence to U.S. civil society. To approach
"blackness's grammar suffering" is therefore to contemplate, albeit
always indirectly, not the paradigm of disability which is always
already predicated on agency but a radical non-capacity. Wilderson's
illumination of how [the **["antagonism"]{.mark} that [obtains around
blackness is structural]{.mark} to the [formation of U.S. civil
society]{.mark} has the effect of clarifying the positioning of
sub-fields such as [Disability and Asian American studies]{.mark},
especially when their protocols aim toward establishing some form of
political justice based upon "exploitation and alienation," which [is at
odds with "blackness's grammar of suffering."]{.mark} As previously
mentioned, Wilderson draws a sharp distinction between "conflict" and
"antagonism." And this is key, as it is [only when anti-blackness is
positioned]{.mark} as an "antagonism" that the residual and structural
effects of the Slave (the non-human) [can be allowed to erupt into the
living present of U.S. civil society.]{.mark}**]{.underline} As such,
though by comparison far more optimistic than Wilderson's study,
Alexander's The New Jim Crow (2010) gives powerful evidence to
Wilderson's theory of the "structural antagonisms" that contour U.S.
civil society. This is how a critical theory based upon advancing a
colorblind world or an ethicality based upon the universal human
effectively silences the suffering of the Black. As Alexander argues:
Far from being a worthy goal ... colorblindness has proved catastrophic
for African Americans. It is not an overstatement to say that the
systematic mass incarceration of people of color in the United States
would not have been possible in the post-civil rights era if the nation
had not fallen under the spell of a callous colorblindness. ... Saying
that one does not care about race is offered as an exculpatory virtue,
when in fact it can be a form of cruelty. ... Our blindness also
prevents us from seeing the racial and structural divisions that persist
in society: the segregated, unequal schools, the segregated, jobless
ghettos, and the segregated public discourse―a public conversation that
excludes the current pariah of caste \[the incarcerated black males in
U.S. civil society\]. (228) In this, Wilderson's Red, White, & Black and
Alexander's The New Jim Crow bring into sharp focus why [the **[framing
of blackness within U.S. civil society cannot do without the ruse of
analogy]{.mark} which [effectively]{.mark} puts under [erasure]{.mark} a
"... violence which turns a body into flesh, ripped apart literally and
imaginatively, destroy\[ing\] the possibility of ontology because it
positions the Black in an infinite and indeterminately horrifying and
open vulnerability, an object made available**]{.underline} (which is to
say fungible) for any subject" (Wilderson, 38). Put otherwise, **[this
["violence"]{.mark} which is in excess of that ideologically saturated
term called Humanity [demands the infinitely difficult yet necessary
encountering with]{.mark} what gives [U.S. civil society]{.mark} the
simulacrum of ethical and political decency.]{.underline}**

responding to a "911 call reporting that \[Mr. McDole\] had shot

victim]{.mark}, not a criminal**. He was described as a disabled man
with injury. A man who was suicidal; in need of help. **His need, [his
victimhood, was not seen]{.mark}**. He was not recognized by the police
as a vulnerable person. **[He was seen as a Black man; a
threat]{.mark}**---a body marked for death by the danger he posed to

**[despite]{.mark}** him being **[confined to a

Black males in America, his execution was recorded and subsequently
released to the American public for summary judgment---just or unjust
killing of a Black man. Unlike the hundreds of Black men killed every
year in America, however, [Mr. McDole was paralyzed from the waist down

Like many academic fields, [**[disability studies]{.mark} has been
[confronted with]{.mark} its [raced, classed, and gendered assumptions
about the body which lies at the center of conceptualizations of
disability]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Over a decade ago, Phil Smith argued
in "Whiteness, Normal Theory, and Disability Studies," that "[[whiteness

underlies]{.mark} the rationality of **[Eurocentric]{.mark} culture and
[thought]{.mark}**. It serves to **push to the margins** not only those
defined as **not-white**, but also those defined as
**not-Able."**]{.underline}3 Similarly, Chris Bell's "Introducing White
Disability Studies: A Modest Proposal," argues that disability studies
functions to commodify Blackness as synonymous with disability.
Reflecting on the Queer disability conference held in 2002, he writes
many disabled non-whites "could not understand the overarching mentality
of many of the attendees, perhaps best expressed by a remark made in a
breakout session: 'Being disabled is just like being black, so society
should stop hating us and give us our rights.' "4 Bell clarifies in a
footnote that **[[disability studies normalizes disability such that the
white disabled body is the]{.mark} conceptual/anthropological [origin of
disabledness]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Far from excluding people of color,
"[[White]{.mark} Disability [Studies treats people of color as if they
were white people; as if there are **no critical exigencies**]{.mark}
involved in being people of color that might necessitate these
individuals understanding and negotiating disability in a different way
from their white counterparts]{.underline}."5

type**, [is]{.mark} then [the **basis of distortion or
disfiguration**]{.mark} which defines the disabled other. **The [racial
designation]{.mark} of whiteness [exceeds the borders of what is often
meant by identity]{.mark};** who identifies or can be identified as a
white person]{.underline}. In actuality, [whiteness speaks to something
more fundamental in the West that has come to define what it is to be
human or nonhuman. **[To be non-white is to be abnormal---evolutionarily
behind---in the phylogenetic order of human development]{.mark}.**
Those]{.underline} who are [raced have historically been constructed as
the degenerate/inferior/nonhuman opposite to the rational prototype of
the human/superior/(Western) (abled) human]{.underline}.6 An outgrowth
of nineteenth-century eugenics, "[[**degeneration** became a]{.mark}
compelling **[racial metaphor]{.mark}** such that the [colonized races
were]{.mark} [assumed]{.mark} to be **[intrinsically
degenerate]{.mark}**, and as a result could never be
improved.]{.underline}"7 [Degeneracy [suggested **biological weakness
and disease**]{.mark}, often translating "into an attribution of
diminished cognitive and rational capacities of nonwhite
populations]{.underline}."8

In the West, **[these [colonial accounts of abnormality became
dichotomizing anthropological designations separating those who are
human from those who are not human.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Those bodies
whose origin are thought to share a phylogenic distance from European
man have been thought to be the embodiment of pathology, degeneracy, and
racial inferiority. As a kind of abnormality, [[**disability** was
considered to be **unnatural and detestable**]{.mark}, while
**[normality became synonymous with]{.mark}** that which was natural and
a means "of establishing the **[universal]{.mark}, [unquestionable good
and right]{.mark}."**]{.underline}9 The moral constitution of the self,
the interior character one possesses, became associated with the
physical and mental formation of the body. Oye\`ronke Oyewumı argues
that under Western epistemology, "[The body is given a logic all its
own. It is believed that just by looking at it one can tell a person's
beliefs and social position or lack thereof."10 [Because "**the body
is**]{.mark} the **[bedrock]{.mark}** [on which **social order** **is
founded**, **the body is always in view and on
view**]{.mark},"]{.underline}11 so the somatological becomes intuitive;
that which is obvious when gazed upon. [In the West, sight analyzes the
body, and becomes the instrument used to identify biological deficiency
which is thought to indicate degeneracy and inferiority. In this
circuitous epistemology, [the **deformity of the body** is a
**reflection** upon the supposed **distortion**]{.mark} of the mind,
just as the distortion of the mind [suggests the **savage
degeneracy**]{.mark} of the body.]{.underline}

In "Pathology to Power: Rethinking Race, Poverty and Disability," Pamela
Block, Fabricio Balcazar, and Christopher Keys explain that, even in the
twenty-first century, "[the concept of disability, when applied as a
medical or psychological diagnosis, can subsume the culturally,
socially, and historically derived identity of an individual beneath a
label of pathology]{.underline}."12 Despite the supposedly progressive
social conscience of the American public, and the seemingly infinite
theoretical nuances in identity theory, [[there is
an]{.underline}]{.mark} anthropological, and dare I say, [**[ontological
problem]{.mark}**, which continues to re-emerge as the basis of engaging
those bodies perceived as disabled. **[This risk of being reduced to the
perception and anxieties of others is only amplified by the
vulnerabilities racial groups have in mainstream society]{.mark}**.
Whereas "[**white individuals** **with disabilities** can
**recognize**]{.mark} that their **[disability]{.mark}** [is the]{.mark}
main [reason why they are **discriminated against, segregated, and
oppressed**]{.mark},]{.underline} \[[disabled [minority
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}[\] [have a harder time
separating]{.underline}]{.mark} [or consolidating their **[multiple
identities]{.mark}**."]{.underline}13 [**Non-whites experience
"segregation and discrimination independent of their disability.** If we
also consider the fact that poverty is a major source of marginalization
and that most individuals of color with disabilities are poor, then the
experience of disability is only one more factor in an already oppressed
existence.]{.underline}"14

But what of Black males? Despite over a decade of work identifying the
whiteness and bourgeois assumptions in disability theory, there has not
been any attempt to create specific theories of Black male disability
which engages the vulnerabilities his body has to death,
hyper-sexualization, and super-humanism in America. Even Nirmala
Erevelles's work, which does an excellent job articulating the link
between colonial concepts of inferiority, be they racial or cultural,
misses the opportunity to fully articulate the vulnerabilities
racialized maleness has within her transnational feminist disability
studies perspective.15 This is not to suggest Erevelles does not engage
the disabled Black male body. The concern she conveys for her husband
Robert who was suffering with a grade IV brain tumor is a startling
reminder of how the Black male body is perceived as a danger regardless
of its actual physical state. As a Black male, I understand her relief
when she tells the reader how lucky they both felt that most of Robert's
seizures occurred in the privacy of their own home.16 I know her fear,
the repetitive terror she experienced imagining her husband being shot
or killed because the public did not know how to react to a Black male
body seizing. Erevelles is correct: "[**[The Black male body]{.mark}**
\... [is]{.mark} a source of **[terror]{.mark}** in white patriarchal
society, and when [transformed during a **grand mal
seizure**]{.mark}---with [rolled back eyes]{.mark}, harsh [grunting
sounds]{.mark}, [mouth drooling]{.mark} bloody foam, [and]{.mark} the
occasional [loss of control]{.mark} of bodily function [with]{.mark} its
associated [putrid smell---could]{.mark} [become]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n
even more [**terrifying spectacle** as a result of]{.mark} the now
lethal triple combination of [**race, gender, and
disability."**1]{.mark}]{.underline}7 But [what conditions the maleness
of this Black disabled body? What is the role Black man plays in
Erevelles's knowledge that "to be perceived as a dangerous black man in
the wrong place at the wrong time \... could result in death,"18 and the
public's fear that even a disabled Black man is Black and male enough to
pose a threat?]{.underline}

[There is an asserted claim in gender theory holding that maleness need
not have a separate theoretical account as an attribute of the racial
body, as it represents privilege, domination, and hegemony in its
relation to femaleness]{.underline}.19 For many, acknowledging the
horror the Black male body conveys is enough, but [the lack of an
explanatory account as to why **[the Black male body is peculiarly
dehumanized within patriarchal racial logics leaves the multiple levels
of vulnerability Black males experience unexplored and
untheorized]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While it is obvious to many that
Black males are seen as dangerous, it is often unacknowledged that
[[Black men and]{.mark} [boys have a]{.mark} long [history of being
**victims of rape, sexual violence, and
cannibalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.20 [[Black maleness is]{.mark} easily
[**acknowledged** as being the cause of **white aggression and
violence**, but]{.mark} these [**ignored violence**(s]{.mark}), **which
[exist in the sexual register]{.mark}**[, are thought]{.mark} to be [of
no consequence]{.mark} to how Black men and boys are perceived, desired,
and feared.]{.underline}21 This essay attempts to remedy this deficit in
theory how the Black male body generally, and the disabled Black male
body more specifically, is engaged as a phobia-inspiring entity. Because
the Black male body is confined to the realm of terror---a living
corporeal horror---I argue the recognition of physical or mental
disability by white onlookers is subsumed by white fear. In other words,
disability in the Black male is unrecognizable by whites because of a
very real racial anxiety.

Capitalism, Disability, and the relative surplus population I would like
to start by establishing the grounds on which I shall build my
reflections. My first and final argument is that **[[disability in
capitalism is a social product of the contradictions produced by the
clash between forces of exploitation and forces of
labour.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It is rather important to clarify,
perhaps to the despair of postmodern perspectives (Eagleton 1998; 2016;
Harvey 1990), that I shall focus my considerations on **[[what we could
call a materialist universalising view of the body and the mind, a body
and mind that are expected by capitalism, the labour body/mind.]{.mark}
[The body/mind that is able to work and to sell its labour force in the
market, so that it may extract surplus value from this abled-to-work
body/mind.]{.mark} [The contrast of the abled labour body/mind is the
disabled body/mind, which is a term "used to classify persons deemed
less exploitable or not exploitable by the owning class who control the
means of production in a capitalist economy"]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Russel 2019, p. 42). **[[Those "deemed]{.underline}]{.mark}** less
exploitable or **[[not exploitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**", deviant from
the ideal labour body/mind, may **[[be considered]{.underline}]{.mark}**
part of what Karl Marx calls **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}** Stagnant
**[[Surplus Population]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Figure 1), or the third
category of the Relative Surplus Population (floating, latent, and
stagnant) or Industrial Reserve Army (Marx 1990) -- discussed in chapter
25 "The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation" of the first volume of
the Capital. Although a famous quotation amongst Marxists is commonly
used to summarise the author's arguments3 , I would like to linger a
little longer on his discussion of the Relative Surplus Population in
order to establish **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}** theoretical
**[[connection between]{.underline}]{.mark}** a stagnant
**[[surplus]{.mark} [population]{.mark} [and the materiality of the
lives of people labelled disabled in the capitalist
society]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the 21st century[.]{.mark} Marx (1990,
p. 794) argues that The relative surplus population exists in all kinds
of forms. Every worker belongs to it during the time when he is only
partially employed or wholly employed. Leaving aside the large-scale and
periodically recovering forms that the changing phases of the industrial
cycle impress on it, so that it sometimes appears acute, in times of
crisis, and sometimes chronic, in times when business is slack, we can
identify three forms which it always possesses: the floating, the
latent, and the stagnant. David Harvey (2010, p. 145) clarifies that
**[t[he surplus population is what "permits capitalists to super-exploit
their workers without regard for their health or
wellbeing".]{.mark}]{.underline}** Marx understands that there is a
relation between the growth and accumulation of capital and the demand
for a labour force, as capital expands so does the need for more
workers - "\[a\]ccumulation of capital is therefore multiplication of
the proletariat" (Marx 1990, p. 764). However, if the number of workers
employed increases, so does the price of labour - an increase on wages -
which means "a reduction in the unpaid labour the worker has to supply"
(Marx 1990, p. 770). Despite its apparent simplicity, this movement is
nevertheless more complex than it appears to be4 , but it can be
summarised as follows: it is capitalistic accumulation itself that
constantly produces, and produces in the direct ratio of its own energy
and extent, a relativity redundant population of labourers, i.e., a
population of greater extent than suffices for the average needs of the
self-expansion of capital, and therefore a surplus-population. (Marx
1990, p. 782, my highlights). For starters, we should not forget that
the sole aim of the capitalist is to produce profit5 . Capitalists are
ruled by what Harvey calls "the coercive laws of competition" (2010, p.
146), in Marx's words: "a coercive force external to him" (1990, p.
381). When wages rise, they become an obstacle between capitalists and
the maximum amount of profit that can be extracted. More elements will
then come into place, among others, the intensification of the
exploitation of the work force and the use of technology to increase
productivity and profitability (Harvey 2010; 2011; Marx 1990). One
example that may be useful to illustrate such an abstract relation is
that of bank workers in Brazil in the last 30 years. In the 1990s, bank
employees in Brazil created influential labour unions to exert pressure
on banks, therefore demanding higher quality jobs - higher salaries,
less working hours, more job places, amongst others. When going on
strikes, until the early 2000s, those unions would still have some
influence in the decision-making process in the organisation of banks.
In 2020, the widespread use of the new technology, which allows users to
solve most of their needs using their smartphones, has caused demands
for higher productivity, wage drops, more working hours, and an increase
in unemployment in the sector - industrial reserve army. While strikes
of the sector in the 1990s were catastrophic (crowds of employees on the
streets, freezing of banks, very little or no money available, the
support of the population), a strike in 2020 gathers a few dozen with
signs in the streets that are usually ignored by most passerby, looking
down at their smartphones. Leading us then to an important hallmark of
capitalist labour exploitation practices: The Industrial Reserve Army as
a regulator of the tensions between the exploiters and the exploited. As
capital multiplies and grows, it also tends to follow two internal
movements, namely concentration and centralisation. Respectively, the
augmentation of capital and control of this capital in the hands of
fewer people. At the other pole, it also produces what Marx called in
the previous quote "a relatively redundant working population", that is,
the surplus population (Marx 1990, p. 782). This surplus population
forms an army of workers who may at times be absorbed or rejected by the
capital, according to the capital's own needs (variation in the number
of workers in a certain area), requirements (level of education,
expertise, and/or experience), rules (wages/salaries, working hours,
holidays, health insurance). In other words, "the working population
therefore produces both the accumulation of capital and the means by
which it is itself made relatively superfluous; and it does this to an
extent to which is always increasing" (Marx 1990, p. 783). In the case
of Brazilian bank clerks, the introduction of new technological
machinery, as Marx calls it, allowed banks to dispose of thousands of
employees and change the rules of the game, it developed new needs and
new requirements. The first category of the relative surplus population
characterises workers that are "sometimes repelled, sometimes attracted
again in greater masses" by the job markets (Marx 1990, p. 794). A
modern example may be the situation of engineering workers in Brazil -
when the economy is growing, they are the first ones to be absorbed and
to get higher salaries and better conditions of work. However, as the
economy slows, they are repelled by the companies, made redundant, and
will be unemployed again. The latent category represents those with
potential to be part of the capitalist labour force but are in
agricultural areas still struggling to survive with their own practices
against massive capitalist companies; it is the representation of the
death of a rural lifestyle. As cities and companies grow, they swallow
small family farms and ranches, leaving those families with no other
option but to sell their properties to the big companies, move to the
cities, and sell their labour force. It is a situation portrayed in
literature by Theodore Dreiser in The Lost Phoebe (1918) and by
Graciliano Ramos in Vidas Secas (1938), and more recently in the
American sitcom The Ranch (2016-2020), and vastly discussed in the works
of Raymond Williams. The last category, the stagnant, is formed by those
who must subject themselves to the lowest conditions of work, to the
most irregular forms of employment, and to "a maximum of working time
and a minimum of wages" (Marx 1990, p. 796) - a sediment of the working
class that lives in the poorest conditions of life. Now that we have
reached the stagnant category, we should remember that when Marx is
discussing the three forms of relative surplus population, he is
categorising workers, in other words, those who are forced to sell their
workforce because they do not own any means of production -- der
Arbeitsmensch. They are those who are able to sell their workforce;
those who are at their full capacity in body and mind to create surplus
value at the lowest cost, with the lowest adaptation possible, as it is
remarked by Marx (1990) and by Engels (1987). In contrast, **[[when
dealing with disability]{.underline}]{.mark}**, we are considering
**[[those]{.underline}]{.mark}** who have been **[[labelled by
capitalist practices]{.underline}]{.mark}**, symbols, and meanings
**[[as disabled, unproductive, and as a burden to the rest of the
working class. A burden to the]{.mark}]{.underline}** rest of the
**[[working class because]{.underline}]{.mark}** "what becomes of the
operative..., in case **[[he cannot work]{.mark}, [is no concern of the
employer]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (Engels 1987, p. 543)[.]{.mark} Engels
here sheds light on an important element of our discussion: **[[the
class condition is a fundamental aspect of analysis when we are
discussing disability.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Marx (1990, p.797, my
highlights) enumerates three categories of those who dwell in pauperism
-- the lowest sediment of the relative surplus population', (1) those
who are able to work but who are not working; (2) orphans and pauper
children; and, finally, (3) 'the demoralized (sic), the ragged, and
those unable to work, chiefly people who succumb to their incapacity for
adaptation, an incapacity which results from the division of labour...
Note that here he is dealing with the incapacity of adaptation. And he
goes on to identify these workers as those "who have lived beyond the
worker's average lifespan; and the victims of industry... the mutilated,
the sick..." (1990, p. 797, my highlights). **[[Marx
approaches]{.underline}]{.mark}** both the issues of ageism and
**[[ableism]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the same category **[[to indicate
that those who are deemed useless by capitalist practices and excluded
from the labour market will dwell in pauperism.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
To clarify, pauperism is The hospital of the active labour-army and the
dead weight of the industrial reserve army. Its production is included
in that of the relative surplus population, its necessity is implied by
their necessity; along with the surplus population, pauperism forms a
condition of capitalist production, and of the capitalist development of
wealth. It forms part of the faux frais of capitalist production: but
capital usually knows how to transfer these from its own shoulders to
those of the working-class and the petty bourgeoisie. (Marx 1990, p.
797). It seems to be implied that he differentiates the surplus
population and pauperism. They are both conditioned to the ontological
structure of the capitalist system and its ongoing wealth-making
process. When Marx brings them together, he binds them, stating that one
will be responsible for the other (the dead weight of the industrial
reserve army), he is providing arguments against the traditional
categorisation of disability as a personal and individual problem. Once
again, **[[disability is approached as a]{.underline}]{.mark}** social,
cultural, historical, and **[[class-related
issue.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In a recent study, Santos (2020)
scrutinised data on the living conditions of the Brazilian population
comparing and contrasting the categories of race, gender, and disability
with class condition. The author identifies how these elements come
together to derail people's access to a flourishing life in a racist,
sexist/ patriarchal ableism, neoliberal Brazilian society. According to
her, 30,06% of the population with a disability live with within the
range of 0-1 minimum wage (R\$ 1,100 reais) -- in Brazil this means
deprivation from a wide variety of essential goods and services, i.e.,
living in pauperism or close to pauperism. From another geographical
perspective, in the United States, according to Erevelles (2011, p. 56),
"\[...\] "one out of every four disabled people lives below the poverty
line, and more than 75 percent have an individual income of less than
\$20,000." In the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, Marx
discusses the existence (Dasein) of the Arbeitsmensch in the
labour-capital relationship. He points out that "\[**[[p\]olitical
economy... does not recognise the unoccupied
worker]{.underline}]{.mark}**, den Arbeitsmenschen, in so far **[[as he
happens to be outside]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[the\]
**[[labourrelationship]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (1988, p. 86), that is,
**[[it]{.mark} [does]{.mark} [not]{.mark} [recognise]{.mark}
[their]{.mark}]{.underline}** Dasein, their
**[[existence.]{.underline}]{.mark}** According to Marx, "they are
figures (Gestalten)..., specters(sic) (Gespenster) outside the domain of
political economy" (1988, p. 86). Those deemed less exploitable or not
exploitable are ghosts to a system that values profit over anything
else. As I pointed out, when we consider **[[the "class-disability"
relationship in the working class]{.underline}]{.mark}**, we are
**[[deal]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing [**[with]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
sphere of pauperism -- **[[those on the lowest, poorest, most degrading
conditions of life.]{.mark} [These are]{.mark}]{.underline}** either
**[[those]{.mark} [who]{.mark}]{.underline}** refuse to follow the
system of discipline imposed by the capital or those who **[[deviate
from the ideal labour body/mind.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Harvey (2010,
p.149) points out that: there is the problem of what to do with people
who don\'t conform and are therefore dubbed odd or even deviant. And
this is Foucault\'s as well as Marx\'s point: they are called mad or
antisocial and incarcerated in insane asylums or prisons; or as Marx
notes, they get put in the stocks, mocked and punished. **[[To be a
\"normal\" person]{.underline}]{.mark}**, therefore, **[[is to accept a
certain kind of spatiotemporal discipline convenient to a capitalist
mode of production.]{.underline}]{.mark}** What
**[[Marx]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[demonstrates]{.underline}]{.mark}**
is that this isn\'t normal at all - [**[it\'s a social construct that
arose during this historical]{.underline}**
**[period]{.underline}**]{.mark} in this particular way and **[[for
these particular reasons.]{.underline}]{.mark}** According to Harvey, to
be normal is to conform. **[[Those who deviate will be labelled as
abnormal]{.underline}]{.mark}**, irrelevant, will be deemed useless,
**[[and set aside. So, normality does exist for
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- and it is very specific. On the one
hand, it does not mean that we should simply accept it as a universal
truth. On the other hand, we should not deny normality either but
address it and question it. **[[Theoretical and methodological
perspectives that aim to refuse the existence of these antagonistic
forces -- normality and abnormality -- in capitalist
practices]{.underline}]{.mark}**, symbols, and meanings, in an attempt
**[[to promote equality and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the so-called
**[[inclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**[contribute to the ontological
reproduction of the system that created]{.underline}** **[the antagonism
in the first place.]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[Labelled]{.mark}
[as]{.mark}]{.underline}** irrelevant and **[[disposable]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [the]{.mark}]{.underline}** political and **[[economic
structure,]{.mark} [disabled people]{.mark}]{.underline}** may be
allocated in the Stagnant category of the Relative Surplus Population.
In fact, even when they are absorbed by the system in times of need or
when the system is forced to absorb them by affirmative action policies,
those in the stagnant category "[**[can be rendered superfluous at the
slightest downturn]{.underline}**]{.mark} of the business cycle" (Russel
2019, p. 76). Barnes (1992, p. 55) defines disability as "a diverse
system of social constraints imposed on people with impairments by a
highly discriminatory society --- to be a disabled person means to be
discriminated against". A social approach to disability, therefore, does
not deny the impairment, but understands that there is a
socio-historical difference between impairment, disability, and
disabled: the impairment is biological, the disability is social, and
disabled is the end result of disabling a person with an impairment6 .
Vygotsky (1993, p. 36) argues that "\[i\]n the final analysis, what
decides the fate of a personality is not the defect \[impairment in
today's terminology\] itself, but its social consequences". And it is
this socio-psychological realisation that may or may not be a disabling
one. In their development, disabled children will only require processes
that will stimulate them in other ways rather than those traditionally
applied at home, school, and any other social situation. As deviants of
the patterns of normality, however, disabled people are many times
completely or partially deprived of social participation. Deviant bodies
and minds are expected to either follow the stabilised rules of society
or not be part of it at all. Let us take a scene in Jack Nicholson's One
Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest as an example. His character, Randle P.
McMurphy, is in the swimming pool of a total institution for those
considered mentally ill and/or intellectually disabled and tells one of
guards that within six days he is going to leave the institution. To his
surprise, according to the guard, he will only leave the institution
when allowed to, when the doctors and nurses consider that he is able to
adjust to social order. Randle is only pretending to have a disability
to dodge prison, but to many of his companions it means never leaving
the institution, because **[[according to]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
rules, requirements, and needs of the **[[capital they have already been
deemed deviant and disposable]{.underline}]{.mark}** or, as Harvey put
it, they are "incarcerated in insane asylums or prisons \[...\] they get
put in the stocks, mocked and punished" (2010, p. 149).

**[2NC \-\-- Root Cause]{.underline}**

**The political economy is the best analytic to explain forms of ableist
violence that lead to material impacts that disabled populations must
face. Only understanding "competence" as indebted to the structures of
productivity and labor relations can reshape WHAT society values.**

**[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** the analyses of **[[disability]{.mark},
[is]{.mark}]{.underline}** an **[[essential]{.underline}]{.mark}**
aspect of it[.]{.mark} There are complex divergencies between facing an
impairment in the higher classes, in the middle-classes, or in the
lower-classes7 (See Erevelles 2011; Cabral 2021; Russel 2019; Santos
2020). Wright (1998) argues that **[[exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark}**
is a grounding concept when it comes to class analysis because it
**[[creates a fissure between]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[higher
classes]{.underline}]{.mark}** (the owners of the capital, land, and
means of production), **[[who exploit,]{.mark}
[and]{.mark}]{.underline}** the rest **[[who are
exploited.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The development of capitalist
relations, however, engendered new classes, a class that originates from
the social and technical divisions of labour (Wayne 2020; Wright 1998).
The middle-classes are constituted by those in the working class who
perform jobs that require more complex skills in contrast to those who
are working in manual jobs - and thus tendentiously share contrasting
interests with them. These are also called in sociological works primary
and secondary sector jobs, which respectively represent "those with high
wages, high skill levels, good working conditions, job security, and
ample opportunities for promotion" in contrast to "low wages, low skill
levels, poor working conditions, little job security, and few if any
possibilities for advancement." (Barnes 1992b, p. 57). Wayne (2020, p.
5) keenly highlights that The social division of labour is linked to
class formation because across the various branches of productive
activity designed to meet variable social needs, the same social types
in control of those branches have more in common with each other than
they do with their immediate workers, who have the least control, least
power and lowest remuneration in the production process. The
[**[maintenance of class structure and]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
inducement of competition and [**[individualism
in]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
**[[working]{.mark}-[class]{.mark}]{.underline}**es **[[is]{.mark}
[a]{.mark}]{.underline}** fundamental **[[trait to the ontological
continuation of capitalism.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The social division
of labour focuses on the formation of an un-critical, individualist, and
indebted working-middle class with no sense of unity or class
consciousness (Marx & Engels 2008; Mészáros 2008; 2011). The spread of
meritocratic values amongst the professional and managerial strata of
the working-class gives them a glamorous look and the false impression
that they are closer to the top than to the bottom, that they share more
with those in power than with those in classes below them (Wayne &
Cabral 2021). The relevance of the discussion of class lies in the fact
that when we talk about inclusion without questioning capitalism, we are
usually referring to the right to enter the labour force and be
exploited. **[[Disability]{.mark} [in]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[working-class]{.mark} [demands]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[absence]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}** one of the
**[[non-disabled]{.mark} [members]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the family
from the labour market **[[to]{.mark} [provide]{.mark} [care]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [disabled]{.mark}]{.underline}**
member[.]{.mark} This care may also be relegated to a philanthropic
special institution - in the latter, allowing all working members of the
families to be absorbed by the capital (Russel 2019). It may be argued,
however, that the concepts and definitions of what it means "to be able
to work" are variable (Stone 1984). Indeed they are, but those are
regulated by the State and by the capitalists themselves, and they vary
not only influenced directly by pressures of society, but by the demands
of the capital (Russel 2019). In other words, it means to say that their
jobs and **[[the]{.mark} [place]{.mark} [they]{.mark} [occupy]{.mark}
[are]{.mark}]{.underline}** both **[[part]{.mark}
[of]{.mark}]{.underline}** a **[[regulatory system of the
capital]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as Russel (2019) argues, and a special
kind of charity - in either case [**[their workforce is easily
disposable]{.underline}**.]{.mark} If we consider here Robert Young's
(2009) analyses of **[[Marx's]{.mark} [concept]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[use]{.mark}]{.underline}** of **[[value]{.underline}]{.mark}**, we may
[in**[dicate]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[that]{.mark}: [in]{.mark}

[less.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Erevelles (2011, p. 252) argues that
"\[...\] "**[[becoming]{.mark} [disabled]{.mark}

[the]{.mark} [enslaved]{.mark}]{.underline}** un-gendered
[**[body]{.underline}**.]{.mark} " and that the "\[...\] actual act of
impairment that is used both to create and at the same time to justify
this construction." Proof of that have also been the recent changes in
the Brazilian legislation regarding the regulations for the mandatory
employment of disabled people. Advancements in laws and legal
regulations are indeed an important part of the struggles of the working
class, but they "are 'solutions' which promote conflict between groups
of disadvantaged workers, rather than making it a right of every citizen
to have a living-wage job and health care" (Russel 2019, p. 77). They
are part of what Mészáros (2008; 2011) regards as corrections in the
structure of the capital. They play a fundamental role in the
ontological conservation of capital when softening the tensions between
the owners of the capital and the working class. Barnes (1992) advocated
in favour of anti-discrimination legislation as a solution to improve
the participation of disabled workers in the labour market, as we all
should. No one would deny that even within the limits of the capital one
should always fight against discrimination, prejudice, and deprivation
of access to better living conditions. Notwithstanding, the market finds
its ways to 'dodge' the legislation. When it comes to disabled workers
that usually happens through what Samuels (2014) calls biocertification.
**[[Biocertification]{.mark} [is]{.mark}]{.underline}** the process
companies and industries use to certify that a new employee will follow
their not-so-secret internal rules, using medical reports, exams, and
tests. By **[[means]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}** biocertification
**[[processes individuals]{.underline}]{.mark}** are **[[reduced]{.mark}
[to]{.mark}]{.underline}** their **[[biological]{.mark}
[characteristics]{.mark} [and are erased as social
subjects]{.mark}]{.underline}**, "\[b\]iocertification materializes the
modern belief that only science can reliably determine the truths of
identity and generally claims to offer a simple, verifiable, and
concrete solution to questions of identity" (Samuels 2014, p. 122). The
structure of capital and its relations of material and cultural
production, distribution, and exchange convey ideological models of
individuals, social relations, and patterns of social behaviour that
must be assimilated to guarantee the right to actively participate in
everyday life, from the most trivial activities to the most complex
forms of social participation. These representations will revolve around
the notions of gender, race, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and, in
the case of the working classes, labour skills. They carry labels of
non-deviant and deviant. **[[The archetype of an ideal]{.mark}
[individual]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [linked]{.mark}
[to]{.mark}]{.underline}** the project of society: Hence, **[[the

[away]{.mark} [as a universal cognitive process.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Oliver 1990, p. 165). Oliver is arguing that the **[[foundations of
prejudice are in fact part of the ideological structure of
capitalism.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It a structure founded on an
ideological and hegemonic set of "ideas, values, belief systems, habits
and practices that defend and legitimise the interests of groups at the
expense of other groups in relationships of inequality" (Wayne 2020, p.
136, author's highlights). Hence, it is important here to clarify my
understanding of five concepts that are usually **[[present]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} [discussions]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}** inequality,
prejudice, and **[[disability:]{.mark}
[oppression]{.mark}]{.underline}**, segregation,
**[[exploitation]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}]{.underline}**
inclusion/**[[exclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is my understanding
that, **[[from a materialist perspective]{.mark}, [they are all
class-related issues.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Oppression derives from the
idea that due to one or more deviant characteristics one is deprived
from access to some or all material, cultural, and social conditions
that would allow them to carry on a fulfilling life or, as Wright (2019)
calls it, a flourishing life. Oppression represents an image of someone
being crushed, smashed, held (socially) against their own will and
despite their own efforts to change. **[[Oppression]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
[a]{.mark} [product]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [ideologies]{.mark}
[embedded]{.mark} [in]{.mark}]{.underline}** the social structure of
**[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** and it is related to
inequality[.]{.mark} Segregation revolves around marginalisation. The
social process in which those who are unable to follow one or more
social expectations are centrifuged, sent to the borders of society.
They are not welcomed to participate in everyday life. Segregation comes
as an alternative to the idea of social exclusion, as we shall see
below. Exploitation, in turn, is the essential concept that sustains
capital every day. The act of extracting surplus value out of those who
own nothing else but their labour power (Marx 2012). Stripped of all
properties and material conditions, workers have no way to sustain life
other than by selling their labour power to those who own those material
conditions. Modern capitalism, however, has become even more complex
than it used to be when Marx's wrote Das Kapital (Wright 2019). In order
to guarantee its own survival, the structure of class conditions was
reshaped based on the social and technical divisions of labour.
Different class interests will clash between those who own the capital,
those in positions that require higher qualification and more
sophisticated skills (the modern middle-classes), and the ones
performing jobs that are socially characterised as lower jobs (Wayne
2020). A material approach to these concepts understands that the
condition of class will determine - imposing starting points, limits,
and ends, as Williams (1988) and Wright (2019) define it - their
extensions and impacts on an individual's life. It means to say that one
may be segregated but not so much oppressed. So, the extent of the
processes of oppression, segregation, and exploitation is
class-determined. Going back to Wayne's definition of ideology, he
understands that: there is **[[capitalism]{.mark}
[itself]{.mark}]{.underline}** which **[[has a]{.underline}]{.mark}**
built-in cultural **[[tendency]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [decontextualise
]{.mark}]{.underline}**social phenomena[,
**[individualise]{.underline}**]{.mark} social phenomena **[[and
de-historicise social phenomena.]{.mark}]{.underline}** We may also add
that **[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** prematurely or **[[falsely
universalises capitalist culture and value systems]{.mark} ([e.g., the
only way to live]{.mark}]{.underline}**) (Wayne 2020, p. 137).
Therefore, **[[there]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [a]{.mark}]{.underline}**
paramount **[[comprehension]{.mark} [of capitalist
practices]{.mark}]{.underline}** when it comes
**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[analysis]{.mark}
[of]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[disabling]{.underline}]{.mark}**
phenomena[.]{.mark} When we look at Marx's exposition of the sphere of
pauperism, we were in fact targeting how this process of
decontextualisation, individualisation, and de-historicisation affect
those who are considered unable to adapt. Historically and
traditionally, **[[capitalist ideologies have treated disability as a
personal, individual]{.mark} [tragedy, which is]{.mark}]{.underline}**
brought **[[out of context]{.mark} [and history]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
in an attempt **[[to]{.mark} [exempt]{.mark}
[society]{.mark}]{.underline}** from any obligations it might
have[.]{.mark} Against this, Russel (2019, p. 51) argues that: Our
**[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** (particularly medical and social
welfare institutions) have **[[historically]{.mark} [held]{.mark}
[disablement]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [be]{.mark}]{.underline}** an
**[[individual]{.underline}]{.mark}** problem,
**[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[result]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[economic]{.mark}]{.underline}** or social
[**[forces]{.underline}**.]{.mark} They have equated disability with
physiological, anatomical, or mental "defects" and hegemonically held
these conditions responsible for the disabled person's lack of full
participation in the economic life of our society. This approach
presumed a biological inferiority of disabled persons. Their deviation
from social models of adaptation to everyday life and productivity in
the cycle of the capital, established by social standards of normality,
promotes processes of social marginalisation, from institutionalising
policies of discrimination to deprivation of social participation
(Barnes 2012; Bueno 2001; Ferreira 1994; Vygotski 2004). It is in and
from everyday life that the concepts, values, and norms that represent,
regulate and organise a concrete social formation are executed (Heller
2016). Daily life is the expression of the real life of the subjects
that are part of it, it is the immediate unity of action and thought and
expression of concepts, values and norms formed from the hegemonic
ideology conveyed and foisted upon individuals (Chauí 2016; Heller
2016). Everyday life is ordinary thinking, common sense, and the
expression of uncritical thinking. It is the embodiment of men\'s life,
and it is from it that they express their truth, build their beliefs,
and guide their lives (Heller 2016). Everyday thought, the common sense,
is based on experience in the complex ideological network that maintains
the socio-metabolic functioning of capital and aims at the "orientation
towards stability and relatively quiet social reproduction" (Mészáros
2004, p. 486- 487). The process of stigmatisation in the case of
disabled people permeates the complex social construction of everyday
life. The distancing of adaptation to the **[[patterns of
normality]{.underline}]{.mark}** established in everyday life
**[[crystallise]{.underline}]{.mark}**s the **[[stigma]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [removes]{.mark}]{.underline}** from the **[[person]{.mark}
[with]{.mark}]{.underline}** an **[[impairment]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the condition of 'human' **[[and]{.mark} [projects]{.mark}
[it]{.mark}]{.underline}** socially **[[as]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
'**[[non-human']{.underline}]{.mark}** -- as Marx's pointed out a
spectre **[[to political economy.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The
representation of the stigma occurs by a reduction of the subject to
only one of its characteristics - usually that which is downgraded or
socially overvalued (Goffman 1963). The possible overcoming of these
conditions, or even the performance of more basic daily actions, can
raise the stigmatised subject to the condition of superhuman, keeping
them still in a non-human status. A stigmatised person may, however,
reformulate the rules when they reach a position a social prestige. They
are taken to the level of representation of their group and will be
considered the example of self-determination, meritocracy, and success
(Goffman 1963; McNamee & Miller 2009; Wayne & Cabral 2021). Leonard
Kriegel (1987) scrutinised the images of representation of disabled
characters reproduced in literature and narrowed them down to four
categories, namely: Demonic ~~cripple~~, Charity ~~cripple~~, Realistic
~~cripple~~, and Survivor ~~Cripple~~. I will not discuss all of these
categories, but the last one may be useful here to illustrate my
previous arguments. The Survivor ~~Cripple~~ "\[...\] is the man who
endures and, in his endurance, discovers survival as a cause in itself
\[...\]. His endurance is attractive, both to himself and to the
audience, for it is constructed around his understanding of the
limitations it has imposed on him." (KRIEGEL, 1987, p. 38). The survivor
~~cripple~~ is the counterpart of the disabled person as pitiable and
pathetic, as an object of pity, it is the representation of meritocratic
values - the one who fights against all odds and thrives. The bridge
between class conditions and **[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** idea of a
(**[[disabled]{.underline}]{.mark}**) survivor [**[relies on
capitalist]{.underline}** **[meritocracy that]{.underline}**]{.mark}
seems to be **[[reproduce]{.underline}]{.mark}**d in the image of the
survivor, both in the **[[lower]{.mark} [and]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
the **[[middle classes.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The image of the disabled
person has been used as a motivational strategy, to trigger feelings of
determination, and has been associated with struggle and the power to
overcome difficulties, usually followed by the question "What is your
excuse?". This may be perceived in the real-life based cinematic
representations of disability, as they may imprint more credibility and
cause a greater effect on the audiences. The Survivor ~~Cripple~~ makes
the impairment a tragedy and overcoming it the objective or the solution
to the problem. The use of disability in motivational campaigns and
films projects the disabled person as an object of ridicule and as their
own worst and only enemy -- "if they wanted, they could." -- and cement
meritocratic values -- "if they did, what's your excuse?". As examples,
I could mention the biographical films based on the lives of Christy
Brown (Sheridan 2008), Gabriela Brimmer (Mandoki 1987), and Stephen
Hawking (Marsh 2014). The decades after 1990 have been marked by various
events and political and social reviews on the role and place of
disabled people in society (Jannuzzi 2004). However, the system of
justification and ideological reproduction of stereotypes in the
categorisation of the socially conceived human body, the labour body and
mind, as perfect permeates concrete social relationships in everyday
life and triggers processes of stigmatisation of the deviants (Samuels
2014; Stone 1984). Stigma is thus very much in constant relation with
the ideologies that are working through culture -- as I have
demonstrated with some examples in the previous paragraph. Competence,
structured by bourgeois ideological pillars, conveyed by the media, and
absorbed by the cultural industry, sells signs and images of youth,
health and happiness (Chauí 2016). It is a powerful method of
manipulation that "inoculate\[s\] individuals with the bourgeois
appetite for personal success" (Freire 1970, p. 147). The social process
of constructing the discourse of the competent produces its dialectical
counterpart, the incompetent. The social and ideological role of the
competent, valued by the social power of science, as an unquestionable
source of knowledge, underlies and justifies the domination and economic
exploitation of one class, considered superior in material and cultural
capital, over the other, expropriated from the whole (Chauí 2016;
Samuels 2014). The analysis of **[[perfection]{.mark}, [based on a
neoliberal ideology]{.mark}]{.underline}**, established mainly after the
1980s (Harvey 2011), **[[subjugates disability]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
the working class mainly **[[to]{.mark} [spaces]{.mark}
[of]{.mark}]{.underline}** pauperism, **[[marginalisation and
segregation]{.underline}]{.mark}** and is marked by the sociopolitical
order and the power of science[.]{.mark} **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}**
ideological **[[projection]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
perfection of [**[productivity]{.underline}**,]{.mark} **[[sociability,
independence, meritocracy]{.mark} [characterises]{.mark}]{.underline}**
in the opposite pole the lack and the insufficiency, emphasising **[[the
defect]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [erasing individuals]{.mark}]{.underline}**
beyond their **[[disability]{.underline}]{.mark}** and making the
construction of their social relations unfeasible (Barnes 2012; Heller
2016; Soldatic & Meekosha 2012a; 2012b; Vygotski 1993)[.]{.mark} The
naturalising element of capital is propagated and foisted upon
individuals that reproduce the social structure through complex
ideological systems of conservation, keeping individuals locked in the
relationships of everyday life. Everyday life is, therefore, the life of
every social subject, without being able to be totally out of it or
completely trapped by it. It is in everyday life that the dominant
metabolic ideological processes are emptied and reified as absolute and
natural truths (Heller 2016; Mészáros 2004; 2016). Mészáros (2005, p.
401) argues that the dominant ideology of capitalism is "\[...\]
sustained by the practical evidence of the established material
structures within which people have to reproduce the material and
cultural conditions of their existence and 'feel at home as a fish in
water'". Most of the population is conditioned by the ideological
standards set by the ruling class. Its ideological structure is: a
logical, systematic, and coherent set of representations (ideas and
values) and norms or rules (of conduct) that indicate and prescribe to
the members of a society what they should think and how they should
think about it, what they should value and how they should value it,
what they should feel and how they should feel it, what they should do
and how they should do it. (Chauí 2016, p. 53). The dominating force of
ideology lies in pacification, naturalisation of the hegemonic social
organisation and unity of interests, although they are conflicting
(Mészáros 2008; Wayne 2020; Zizek 2012). Ideology, in its hegemonic
sense, structures life lived and represents "a sense of reality for most
people in the society, a sense of absolute because experienced reality
beyond which it is very difficult for most members of the society to
move, in most areas of their lives" (Williams 1980, p. 38). It is in the
everyday life that the ideological patterns of normality are executed.
Heller (2016, p. 37) indicates that \[t\]he maturation of man means, in
any society, that the individual acquires all the essential skills for
the daily life of the society (social layer) in question. It is an adult
who is able to live his daily life for himself. Ideological patterns of
normality are socially and historically established attributes and
characteristics that are reproduced as natural and ordinary and that
categorise subjects as normal and abnormal deviant. They establish the
norms that define what it means to be a socially desired human (Amaral
1995; Everlles 2011; Heller 2011). Stigma disqualifies the individual
due to a singular characteristic that deviates from the ideological
norms and standards imposed and determines the limits of their social
participation. Lastly, I would like to go back to inclusion.
**[[Inclusion is]{.underline}]{.mark}** part of **[t[he ideological
process of self-correctness and self-preservation of the bourgeois
society.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It is an attempt to lessen the weight of
structural injustices, inequalities, segregations/exclusions that are
part of the ontological foundations of the capital. Marx's thought
elucidates how contradictory the concept is: when analysing the
production of relative surplus-value, that within the capitalist system
all methods for raising the social productivity of labour are put into
effect at the cost of the individual worker; that all means for the
development of production undergo a dialectical inversion so that they
become means of domination and exploitation of the producers. (Marx
1990, p. 799). Some lines below, he famously concludes that:
Accumulation of wealth at one pole is, therefore, at the same time
accumulation of misery, the torment of labour, slavery, ignorance,
brutalization and moral degradation at the opposite pole, i.e., on the
side of the class that produces its own product as capital. (Marx 1990,
p. 799). Inclusion, therefore, is the movement of opening opportunities
to share material and cultural capital with (some of) those who were
deprived from access to them. It does so without questioning or
challenging the very essence of the society that created deprivation in
the first place. Inclusion and exclusion are part of the same dialects.
One is the dialectical inversion of the other. The need to include only
exists because of a society that engenders exclusion. Thus, as I
suggested, exclusion might not be a real thing, in immediate cultural
and material access perhaps it does, but not as part of the structure of
the system itself, i.e., the individual is not excluded from the system,
they are a product of it. Inclusion and exclusion were uncritically
adopted by all postmodern studies of identity, and inclusion became a
motto to be fought for - as Wayne suggested (2020, p. 39), "change
without real change". In other words, these changes are constrained
within the limits of capitalism and do not represent a threat to the
structure of the system. Notwithstanding its core contradictions, it is
something we shall all fight for. If within the limits and
contradictions of the capital this is the only possibility - or the
closest possibility - some individuals will have to access a flourishing
life - meaning access to education, health, cultural expressions,
housing, food - then until the whole system changes, perhaps it is what
one should fight for. In the case of disabled people, it applies even to
the access or opportunity of access to be exploited -- as cruel as this
may sound; that is what the "inclusion for disabled people" is in fact
fighting for. In that sense, "\[**[[b\]asic changes must be made in the
economic]{.mark},]{.underline}** social, and political
**[[structure]{.underline}]{.mark}** in order **[[to advance economic
solutions that]{.underline}]{.mark}** reach beyond capitalism's
instability. The reserve army, itself, must be made a disposable
concept" (Russel 2019, p. 77). Despite the limitations of what Wayne
calls (following Gramsci) passive revolution -- "the paradox of massive
change within the social relations of capitalism: change without real
change" (Wayne 2020 p. 39, author\'s highlights) -, these seem to
represent a possibility to **[[improve]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[lives]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}** those who are now in need, not
only focusing on **[[disabled people]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but also on
other forms of discrimination as well. My favourite and paramount
argument in that regard is that Every reasonable and reasoned action
proposed in an attempt to accelerate the social and political inclusion
of the poor in the process of economic development in order to bring
equality to social development is historically welcomed. As much within
the scope of the State and its public policies as within civil society.
It would be equally wicked to deny the diversity of the aspirations and
intervention actions in the problematic reality. (Martins 2012, p. 1).
Nonetheless, we should not be satisfied with them, for they do not
interrupt the flow and the logics of the capital.

level, as evidenced by the urge to ask kids what job they want when they
grow up --- as if we dream about labor --- and at the societal level,
where a price tag is put on everything we do. This productivity-driven
mindset permeates everything in a capitalist society]{.underline}. I
grew up idolizing certain jobs: doctors, lawyers and scientists. But, my
admiration wasn't based on how these professions helped people. It was
mostly because I was taught to prioritize their salary, recognition and
prestige. In turn, people who didn't choose a traditional corporate job
were knocked to the bottom and unfairly branded as lazy, useless and
undeserving of respect. I'm still working to dismantle this mindset that
has become ingrained in me, but I've realized it's even more important
to do so when [[capitalism is integral to modern day
ableism.]{.mark}]{.underline} So, what does capitalism have to do with
ableism? Ableism is a product of capitalism[. Simply put, [the system
isn't made for people who are different. This includes people who
have]{.mark} different ambitions, prioritize happiness or family over
work, or have [a different scope of ability.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
ableist-capitalist relationship means that even if not explicitly,
society makes it unnecessarily difficult for disabled people to find
work. Non-manual labor jobs often tack on extraneous physical
requirements that are inherently discriminatory, despite claiming to
hire regardless of disability. Especially in academia, when jobs
listings require "walking, talking and hearing," for example, it sends a
very clear message. When a disabled person secures a job, the employer
might have to shift the functions of their role, or spend small sums of
money to comply with requirements set by the Americans with Disabilities
Act. So, the net profit exploited from a disabled worker may be less
than that from an able-bodied worker. To compensate, many businesses use
a loophole in the Fair Labor Standards Act to justify paying disabled
workers subminimum wage. It's worse than it sounds --- disabled workers
often earn pennies, or even gift cards, and are labeled as "substandard"
because their disability can affect productivity. Before 2014, disabled
people who received benefits such as Medicaid payments or Social
Security Disability Insurance were disqualified if they had assets
totaling more than \$2,000 or if their monthly earnings exceeded \$700.
The job hunt is very discouraging when you know you're going to face
these obstacles and could eventually be forced to forfeit your benefits.
If you were to lose your job, you would have to reapply for these
programs, which often have waitlists a mile long. The Achieving a Better
Life Experience Act was passed in December of 2014, allowing disabled
individuals to open savings accounts for certain disability costs such
as education, housing, transportation, health and basic living expenses.
But the limitations of the ABLE Act still put disabled people at a
disadvantage --- the annual gift tax exclusion, which was \$15,000 in
2020, is the limit for account contributions, and individuals must be
diagnosed with a disability before turning 26 to be eligible. As if
that's not enough, the ableist-capitalist treatment extends beyond the
workplace into daily life. Social Security rules create penalties for
disabled people who want to get married. Sure, they're legally allowed
to marry. But if they do so, they're faced with the possibility of
losing their health insurance, earning a lower monthly income or losing
their benefits altogether. Why do people have to choose between basic
necessities and love? Able-bodied, heterosexual people can joke about
getting married for the "tax benefits" while disabled people are forced
to forfeit their right to marry so they can survive. [[By only rewarding
those who are able-bodied, capitalism feeds into ableism. It produces
and then exacerbates inequalities between the "normal bodies" and those
who are disabled]{.mark}. It seems [obvious a system that relies on the
exploitation of individuals would in turn enable the devaluing of
disabled people because they may require more accommodations and aren't
as easily exploited]{.mark}.]{.underline} During the pandemic, it's also
become obvious that accessibility is possible. Remote work is possible.
But until a global pandemic struck, our capitalist society has not
considered it a possibility --- even for disabled people who could
greatly benefit from these accommodations. It certainly makes one thing
very clear: capitalism deems disabled people unworthy of the time and
effort it takes to dismantle the barriers it is responsible for. If we
able-bodied people want to be allies for those who are disabled, we need
to take on an anti-capitalistic lens. You can't separate the two. [[If
you want to fight ableism, you must be able to recognize that it is, and
has been for a long time, rooted in capitalism.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Crip technoscience centers the work of disabled people as knowers and
makers]{.underline}]{.mark}. Crip technoscience privileges disabled
people as designers and world-builders, as knowing what will work best
and developing the skills, capacities, and relationships to make
something from our knowledge. Unlike typical approaches to disability
that objectify disabled people and situate expertise in medical
professionals and non-disabled designers or engineers, crip
technoscience posits that disabled people are active participants in the
design of everyday life. Not only do disabled people make access in our
everyday lives in ways that do not get recognized as design, but the
lived experience of disability, and the shared experience of disability
community creates specific expertise and knowledge that informs
technoscientific practices.

[[We call for]{.mark} greater [acknowledgement of the lived experiences
and material design practices of disabled people in]{.mark} the work of
[technoscientific intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is a
widespread perception that access technologies are made for us by
non-disabled experts, but there is little recognition of our own
practices of remaking the material world. Yet the field of disability
scholarship grew out of activism against rehabilitative models of
medical expertise and intervention (UPIAS, 1976), crafting a materialist
politics with anti-capitalism at its center (Oliver, 1990; Russell,
1998), and continues to struggle against "compulsory ablebodiedness"
(McRuer, 2006). Crip knowing-making forms the basis of political slogans
such as Nothing About Us Without Us (Charlton, 2000), [[framing disabled
people not just as design experts but also as epistemic activists whose
politicized ways of knowing the material world also situate us to
produce the material conditions that allow disability to thrive]{.mark},
in addition to remaking how disability is known and
experienced.]{.underline} Without glorifying do-it-yourself design
practices, crip technoscience recognizes that disabled peoples'
world-dismantling and world-building labors stem from situated
experiences of "misfitting" in the world (Garland-Thomson, 2011). Crips
are not merely formed or acted on by the world---we are engaged agents
of remaking.

Critical disability studies and justice

The influence of CDS and its challenge to the assumption that disability
is a uniform condition have enabled the emergence of new ideas on
disability. In particular, this has enabled the development of a theory
that can take account of not only impairment effects but also can
include class, ethnicity, sexual orientation or cultural identities. It
has also argued for the re-emergence of a new political identity, one
where a solidarity that was previously built on a common single identity
is replaced by one that incorporates multiple voices including
representatives from across the range of constituencies. The politics
that it seeks to develop will be the ending of the single interest group
identity of the disability movement to be replaced by single-issue
groups campaigning for different social issues. To paraphrase Lister
(1998, 74), [[if disability and impairment are simply]{.mark} to be
'[deconstructed]{.mark} into a kaleidoscope of shifting identities' and
ableist discourses, **[there will be no disabled people left to]{.mark}
either [fight for the right to be]{.mark}, or to be [a
citizen.]{.mark}**]{.underline} If the principles of CDS are evaluated
critically in the light of disadvantage, its analytical and political
value becomes questionable. Its relativism and its suggestions that
impairments are ethically and politically merely neutral differences are
false. [Impairments often have very tangible effects on people's
well-being]{.underline}, many of [which cannot be explained away by
deconstruction]{.underline} (for example, Shakespeare 2006; Thomas
1999). [[Recognizing impairment]{.mark} effects [is necessary]{.mark} in
order [to secure proper treatment and social arrangements]{.mark} that
enhance disabled people's well-being and social participation. CDS runs
the risk of dismissing]{.underline} not only the personal experiences of
living with impairment, but also [the significance of the differences
between socially created disadvantages.]{.underline} These
[[disadvantages]{.underline}]{.mark} that [often [result from
oppressive]{.mark} [social arrangements]{.mark}]{.underline}, are very
much real and take place in different ways for different disadvantaged
groups. [[Disabled people]{.mark} typically [experience disadvantage in
relation to the market]{.mark} and capitalism]{.underline}, and [[they
have to]{.mark} a large extent [been excluded]{.mark} [from
employment]{.mark} and from equal social participation]{.underline},
respect and wealth (Wolff and De-Shalit 2007, 26). On top of these
materialist disadvantages, disabled people are stigmatized as deviant
and undesirable, and also subordinated to various oppressive
hierarchical relations. [For [disabled people]{.mark} to achieve
participatory parity, they require more than recognition; **[they need
material help]{.mark}, targeted resource enhancement, and personal
enhancement**]{.underline} (Wolff and De-Shalit 2007). [Disability is
rooted in the economic structures of society and demands redistribution
of goods and wealth.]{.underline} In contrast to some other oppressed
groups, disabled people require more than the removal of barriers if
they are to achieve social justice. This extra help might be small --
for example, allowing a student with dyslexia extra time in an
examination -- through to complex interventions such as facilitated
communication, a job support worker or 24-hour personal assistance.
Whatever the size, it is an extra cost both to employers and to the
state. These are real needs and represent real differences. Without an
acceptance of these differences it is hard to see how we could move
forward. Whilst these 'real differences' can be presented as the result
of dominant ableist discourses where disabled people's needs are
regarded as extra cost, this does not solve the problem. [The problems
[disabled people]{.mark} face [require **more than ideological
change**]{.mark}, and ideological change is of little use if it does not
result in material change. [CDS **fails to account for the economic
basis of disability**]{.mark} and offers only the tools of
deconstruction and the abolishment of cultural hierarchies to eradicate
economic injustice. This]{.underline}, as Fraser (2000) has argued,
[would be possible in a society where there were no relatively
autonomous markets and the distribution of goods were regulated through
cultural values.]{.underline} In such a society, oppression based on
identity would translate perfectly into economic injustice and
maldistribution. [This is far from the current reality where
'marketization has pervaded all societies to some degree]{.underline},
at least partially decoupling economic mechanisms of distribution from
cultural patterns of value and prestige' (Fraser 2000, 111). Markets are
not controlled by nor are they subsidiary to culture; 'as a result they
generate economic inequalities that are not mere expressions of identity
hierarchies' (Fraser 2000, 111--112). The disadvantage related to
disability is to a great extent a matter of economic injustice, and
[before this injustice can be corrected we have to be able to identify
those individuals and social groups that have been disadvantaged by
social arrangements. Whilst this does create and foster categories and
binaries between groups of people, it also requires some sort of
categories to start with; namely, the various categories of
disadvantage.]{.underline} Both the social and physical mechanisms that
produce human diversity are real, and they produce tangible differences
that cannot be challenged, let alone abolished, merely by pointing out
the wanton nature of difference, and deconstructing the meanings
attached to disability. Changing the social conditions that disadvantage
and disable some people demands that the diverse, sometimes dualistic,
reality of social advantage and disadvantage between different groups of
people is recognized. This is exactly why group identities based on, for
example, impairment, gender, or sexuality have been invaluable tools in
the resistance against discrimination and oppression -- in the fight
against socially produced disadvantage. [[Confident]{.mark}, positive
[disability identity has enabled]{.mark} many disabled [people
to]{.mark} actively challenge the status quo that disadvantages them and
to [claim rights and]{.mark} power and [participation in]{.mark}
dominant [institutions]{.mark}.]{.underline} Being different from the
so-called normal majority is no longer considered to conflict with a
good life, equality and respect. Quite the opposite, [positive
realization of one's difference has been liberating and empowering to
many disabled people]{.underline} (Shakespeare 2006; Morris 1991). For a
radical and active disability movement to emerge and for disabled people
to take action on their own account, they have to see themselves as an
unfairly marginalized or disadvantaged constituency and a minority group
(Shakespeare and Watson 2001). [[The category disabled/ non-disabled is
a good abstraction that can **enable**]{.mark} **the development of
[communities of resistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and without it is
hard to see how these could develop. CDS is premised on the idea that
difference acts as a precursor to the normalizing of behaviour and a
requirement to treat people differently and, importantly, less
favourably. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that the
categories that are applied to disabled people create an unnecessary
divide between disabled and nondisabled people. You could equally make
the point that [[without]{.mark} these [categories we would not
know]{.mark} what it is we have to do, [what actions]{.mark} we have to
take [or what services]{.mark} we have to put in place to include
disabled people.]{.underline} Indeed, [for many disabled people the
disadvantages they are subjected to arise not as the result of
domination but through neglect and the denial of services and through
society failing to take responsibility for those in need.]{.underline}
As Wolff (2009, 114) points out: 'anti-discrimination policy needs to
identify a group to be protected.' In other words, [it is impossible to
fight the oppression of a group of people that does not
exist.]{.underline} Recognition of impairment is also crucial regarding
legislation and policy that aim to protect disabled people against
discrimination. [The point of anti-discrimination legislation is to
protect people from discrimination on the basis of their physical and
mental properties, not on their opportunity to achieve equal
participation and respect.]{.underline} Thus, 'the parallel to race and
gender is not disability but impairment' (Wolff 2009, 135).

As I am making the final revisions on this paper, I have been
experiencing partial deafness for over a year, related to an untreated
inner ear infection which will now result in permanent hearing loss. I
did not attend to it sooner---it was not urgent, and time and energy are
so scarce. They have been made even more so this year as my son has not
been attending school full-time: some weeks he won't go for more than
two or three half days. The recent neoliberal cuts to public services in
the province of Québec---where I reside---have translated into losses
here and there, from removal of school transportation services to cuts
in hours of specialized education, effectively reducing the amount of
time an autistic child can spend at school. It is now late at night, and
I write these lines on an old and very slow netbook as my computer broke
down: when I bought it I had very limited financial resources, so I got
a cheap model with no guarantee. I could have had it fixed sooner,
instead I was striving to pass my PhD comprehensive examination these
last months. There is nothing extraordinary in these circumstances, no
one trait that could be neatly identified and removed, no one issue that
could be adjusted or fixed, so that I could at last perform as a
competitive and unencumbered individual.

combined with the [**[neoliberal imperative of

[particularly for those]{.underline}]{.mark} who are, like me,

**[decontextualize]{.underline}**]{.mark} not only our needs and the

meet both these needs and the demands of individuated functionality.

Academia, **[[care]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and resilience

One of the ways in which liberal and neoliberal versions of independence
and needs are most debilitating is through the idea of resilience.
Resilience is often used as a term to celebrate the ongoing efforts of
those who continue to perform despite difficulties and struggles related
to their particular circumstances (see Jackson et al. 2007). When
thinking in terms of care, the idea of resilience is problematic
because, as Cindy Katz points out, social reproduction, almost by
definition, must be accomplished (Katz 2001). No matter how difficult
our circumstances or how bare our resources get, we, and the persons we
care for, need to eat, sleep, be clothed, warmed, and loved, at least at
a minimal level, in order to go on. Thus people will go to great lengths
(of resilience) to perform care. Resilience, therefore, cannot be taken
as an indicator that people are thriving despite the obstacles they
encounter, despite the inhumane and unjust expectations they face,
particularly in this moment of increasingly harsh neoliberalism (Diprose
2015). Resilience is in fact incredibly stressful. Beyond the financial
and logistical stress associated with both pursuing an academic path and
caring for others, being resilient implies sustaining the ever
underlying stress of feeling that one is never adequately filling their
own needs and those of their dependents.

In this context, resilience implies a projection into the future perfect
(see Povinelli 2011 for a discussion on tenses in late liberal
capitalist economies). It is the idea that there will be a future moment
when the unsustainability of (poor) caring practices will abate. "When
this article is written, this presentation done, this chapter
completed---these hardships that I am inflicting on myself and the ones
I care for will be over, and it will all have been worth it." Except
that this moment never comes. Within an increasingly competitive
academic context, demands are ever emerging and there is no final moment
of grace. As I am writing these lines, everyone in my house is finally
fed, bathed, asleep, and I have made it through another day. It is an
exhausting victory, yet nothing has been achieved that will not have to
be recommenced tomorrow. I have made it through another day, yet the
days of 'another day' are endless.

As problematic as it is, however, there are not many alternatives to
being resilient, to reconcile as well as we can the ever emerging needs
of existence and caring with the expectations for independent and
competitive accomplishments, while waiting for an ever elusive future
perfect. Resilience is indeed fuelled by the fear of breaking down, or,
of falling behind.

Centering our vision of productive contributions as engagements of
atomic and individuated individuals fosters a logic of "if you can't
take the heat, you had better get out of the kitchen." In that context,
asking for help is complicated or hindered by the apprehension that
responses, even from compassionate and concerned peers and superiors,
will be grounded in that logic: "It might be better for you to stop or
take a break at this point," or "Maybe later when your circumstances are
better...". This, however, is not going to happen; these circumstances
will not get better, because once again they are not a punctual and
discrete appendage of a self---or a cohort---that can be circumscribed
or cut out. They are embedded in one's very subjectivity, relationships,
and existence.

Meanwhile the ways we care for one another within the context of
academia are grounded in the dominant logic of independence and
resilience. Our paths as academics are tightly woven in an institution
fuelled by individualism and its correlate ideal of independence, and
the ways in which we care for one another most often fail to radically
challenge this, and to acknowledge the infinity and relationality of our
needs. Caring others---people who care about struggling individuals,
about inequalities in general---will attempt to facilitate academic
paths, but often their actions are limited to more or less punctual
accommodations, such as being a sympathetic listener, providing tissues
in which to cry, and granting extensions. This entails, for the person
receiving this type of support, the stress of navigating academic life
through often last minute actions of generosity that are entirely
dependent on the good will of others, and of knowing that this path of
navigation is unsustainable. In my case it also entails a dissonant
feeling of gratitude for this generosity and trust---it somehow entails
being in the position where I am genuinely grateful for being allowed to
continue maintaining my own existence and that of those who depend on
me.

Punctual acts of generosity and trust are also costly for those who
bestow them. Unsurprisingly in a liberal institution, and particularly
in these neoliberal times, the burden of it rests on individuals. In
addition to the logistical complications that supporting struggling
individuals can entail, there is also the anxiety and dangers of
venturing out of the current academic logic of individualism and
competition. Watching struggling individuals struggle, and attempting to
care for them, generates strain---I have seen it in the faces of
compassionate peers and professors, I have felt it in my face when
confronted by the needs of struggling peers. There again, future perfect
is often our false and cold comfort: "I know it's hard, but just get
this thing done, give a good hard push this time around, and then it'll
be done".

**[[Caring]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [[is necessary]{.mark} as a
way [to **escape**]{.mark} the debilitating effects of]{.underline}
liberal and [[neoliberal paradigms of]{.underline}]{.mark} individualism
and **[[competition in the academy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [On every
university campus there are officially designated **places of
care**]{.underline}. **[Although necessary]{.underline}**, [these
services tend to respond to punctual and neatly delineated needs---such
as discrete episodes of illness or mental distress]{.underline}.
[**[But]{.underline}** [the **type** of caring that
**truly**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[facilitates]{.underline}]{.mark}** my
**[[existence]{.underline}]{.mark}** [is one that does not seek out the
independent and functional person]{.underline} within the grounded,
slow, and encumbered mess that I am. **[Places of care]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} indeed those [places that resist this sort
of]{.underline} surgical [violence.]{.underline}

In my institution one such place is found at a centre offering services
for students who are older women and/or women with children. [There, one
can find a free meal, a bed to rest on, companionship, or
silence]{.underline}. The centre is open everyday, to anyone, as the
needs it addresses are understood to be universal, rather than punctual
traits or shortcomings of a subjectivity that is dysfunctional in one
(or a few) specific ways. Where needs are not failures, one does not
have to identify as such. And so every moment spent in this place of
care preserves for a little while longer the possibilities of my
sustained presence in the academia---the possibilities of an alternative
social project (see Povinelli 2011).

Although it may seem unsatisfactory and insufficient, [maintaining
**possibilities** in the face of exhaustion is
**critical**]{.underline}---it is the basis of everything, including
change (Katz 2001; Povinelli 2011). [The **type of caring** that
**sustains** my **continued existence** as an academic [implies
inserting]{.mark} a logic of **[relationality]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[responsibility]{.underline}**, [[and]{.underline}
**[inter-dependency]{.underline}**]{.mark} within a structure grounded
on individualism and independence---it implies inserting a transgressive
current within an institution which doesn't have the eyes to recognize
it. Caring, then, is very much like Certeau's perruque (Certeau 1991): a
wig made from scrap material by a factory worker, who opportunistically
appropriates glimpses of company resources to create something unseen
and unforeseen by the power in place---to serve a subversive purpose.
Like making a wig, caring within the academy is a creative
diversion---of time, of attention, of affection, of academic positions
designed to foster individual achievements and competition. It is a wink
of recognition to other meanings within a totalizing space. It is an act
of resistance.

[My [concern]{.mark}]{.underline} with this movement [[centers
around]{.mark} an issue that]{.underline} Sloop and Ono [seem to take as
a given, namely, [the **role of the critic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On
one hand, calling for the systematic investigation of existing
marginalized discourses is a natural extension both of critical rhetoric
(see McKerrow 1989, 1991) and of the general ideological turn in
criticism (see Wander 1983). On the other hand, [the ease of transition
from criticism in the service of resistance to criticism of resistance
may obscure the need to address some fundamental issues regarding the
general function of rhetorical criticism in an uncertain and contentious
world]{.underline}. Beyond [licensing the critic to engage in political
struggle]{.underline}, Sloop and Ono advocate the pursuit of covert
resistant discourses.

Such a move not [only stretches our understanding of rhetoric and
criticism, but also alters significantly the relationship between critic
and out- law. Critical interrogation of dominant discursive practices in
the service of political/cultural reform is supplanted in favor of
[positioning]{.mark} covert out- law [communities as **objects of
investigation**]{.mark}. Invited to seek out subversive discourses,
[**the critic** is]{.mark} positioned as [the **active agent of change**
and]{.mark} the out-law [discourse becomes]{.mark} **merely
[instrumental]{.mark}**. Rather than academic criticism acting in
service of everyday acts of resistance, everyday acts of resistance are
put into the service of academic criticism.]{.underline}

Rhetorical resistance

That we are \"caught within conflicting logics of justice that are
culturally struggled over\" (Sloop and Ono 1997, 50) and that rhetoric
is employed in these struggles seems an uncontroversial statement.
Despite the theoretical miasma surrounding judgment, Sloop and Ono
accurately note, the material process of rendering judgments (and of
disputing the logics of litigation) continues in the world of actually
practiced discourse. In the materially contested world, rhetoric is
utilized both by those seeking to secure the grounds of dominant
judgment and by those seeking to undermine or supplant dominant cultural
logics with some out-law notion of justice.

The distinction between these two cultural groups, \"in-law\" and out-
law, however, deserves some consideration prior to any discussion of the
role of the critic as implied in the out-law discourse project. The
discourse of the dominant or those within the bounds of superordinate
logics of litigation is reminiscent of Michel De Certeau\'s (1984)
strategic discourse. For De Certeau, strategies are utilized by those
who have authority by virtue of their proper position. Strategies
exploit the institutionally guaranteed background consensus by which
power relations (and litigations) are maintained and advanced. In
contrast, tactics are utilized by those having no proper place of
authority within the discursive economy who must seek opportunities
whereby the discourse of the dominant might be undermined and contested.
To extend Sloop and Ono\'s definition, out-law discourses are those that
can (and, by their analysis, do) take advantage of situations (e.g.,
race riots) to disrupt the regularity of dominant cultural groups.

The ongoing struggle between strategically instituted cultural dominants
and the \"out-law always lurk\[ing\] in the distance\" (66) is
acknowledged, even celebrated, by Sloop and Ono. What their
acknowledgment fails to provide, however, is a clear need for critical
intervention. Indeed, quite the reverse is presented: It is the critic
(particularly the left-leaning critic) who needs out-law discourse.
While the struggles over justice, equality, and freedom have gone on,
the left-leaning critics are those who have theoretically excluded
themselves from the disputes. The study of out-law dis- courses, then,
provides a means to reinvigorate the intellectual and re-institute
(academic) leftist thinking into popular political struggles (53-54).
Thus, Sloop and Ono\'s project incorporates three types of rhetoric: the
rhetoric of the in-law, presumably the traditional object of critical
attention; the rhetoric of the out-law, the study of which may transform
our understanding of judgment as well as reinvigorate leftist democratic
critiques; and the rhetoric of the critics who, having lost their
political po- tency, can exploit the discourse of the out-law to promote
ideological struggles. It is to this critical rhetoric that I now turn.

Resistance criticism

Sloop and Ono (1997) clearly state the relationship they envision
between the rhetorical critic and out-law discourse: \"Ultimately, we
will argue that the role of critical rhetoricians is to produce
\'materialist conceptions of judgment,\' using out-law judgments to
disrupt dominant logics of judgment\" (54; emphasis added). Here the
critic seeks out vernacular discourse (60), focuses on the methods and
values embodied in these communities (62), listens to and evaluates the
out-law community (62-63), and chooses appropriate discourses for the
purpose of disrupting dominant practices (63). Essentially, it is the
critic who seeks out marginalized discourses and returns them to the
center for the purpose of provoking dominant cultural groups (63).

Despite acknowledging the efficacy of out-law discourses, Sloop and Ono
assume that the critiques generated and presented by the out-law
community have only minimal effect. The irony, and indeed arrogance, of
this assumption is evident when they claim: \"There are cases, however,
when, without the prompting of academic critics, out-law discourses
serve local purposes at times and at others resonate within dominant
discourses, disrupting sedimented ways of thinking, transforming
dominant forms of judgment\" (60; emphasis added). Sloop and Ono seem to
suggest that such locally generated critiques are the exception, whereas
the political efficacy of the academic critic is the rule. This seems an
odd claim, given that the justification for their out-law discourse
project is the lack of politically viable academic critique and the
perceived potency of out-law conceptions of judgment. [[Their suggestion
that out-law communities]{.mark} are in [need]{.mark} of [the academic
critic **contradicts**]{.mark}]{.underline} not only [[the]{.mark}
already [disruptive nature]{.mark} of existing out-law
discourses]{.underline} (the grounds for using out-law discourse), but
also the impotence of contemporary critical discourse (the warrant for
studying out-law discourse).

By this I do not mean that the critiques and theories generated by
academically instituted intellectuals have not been incorporated into
subversive discourses. Just as out-law discourses inevitably mount
critiques of dominant logics, so, too, the perspectives on rhetoric and
criticism generated by academics are used in resistance movements.
Feminist critiques of patriarchy, queer theories of homophobia,
postcolonial interrogations of race have found their way into the
service of resistant groups. The key distinction I wish to make is that
the existence of criticism (academic or self-generated) in resistance
does not necessitate Sloop and Ono\'s move to a criticism of resistance.

What [Sloop and [Ono fail to offer]{.mark}]{.underline} is [[an adequate
argument for \"**taking**]{.mark} **public [speaking out of the
streets]{.mark}** [and **studying it in the classroom**]{.mark}, for
[treating it less as]{.mark} an **expression of
[protest]{.mark}**[\"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wander 1983, 3)
[[and]{.mark} more [as an **object for analysis**]{.mark} and
**reproduction** [within the]{.mark} **political economy of the
[academy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Philip Wander made a similar charge
against Herbert Wicheln\'s early critical project, and this concern
should remain at the forefront of any discussion aimed at expanding the
scope and function of criticism. [Sloop and Ono offer numerous
directives for the critic [without addressing **whether the critic
should be examining**]{.mark} **out-law discourses [in the first
place]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While it is too early to suggest any
definitive answer to the question of criticism of resistance, some
preliminary arguments as to why critics should not pursue out-law
discourses can be offered:

\(1\) [Hidden out-law discourses may have **good reasons to stay
hidden**]{.underline}. Sloop and Ono specifically instruct us that \"the
logic of the out-law must constantly be searched for, brought forth\"
(66) and used to disrupt dominant practices. But [[are we to
believe]{.mark} that]{.underline} all out-law discourses are prepared to
mount such a challenge to the dominant cultural logic? Or, indeed, that
the [[members]{.mark} of out-law communities [are prepared to be
**brought into the arena of**]{.mark} **public
[surveillance]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the service of reconstituting
logics of litigation? It seems highly unlikely that all divergent
cultural groups have developed equally, or that all members of these
groups share Sloop and Ono\'s \"imperial impulse\" (51) to promote their
conceptions and practices of justice.

\(2\) Academic critical discourse is not transparent. Here I allude to
the overall problem of translation (see Foucault 1994; Lyotard 1988;
Lyotard and Thebaud 1985; Zabus 1995) as an extension of the previous
concern. Critical discourse cannot become the medium of commensurability
for divergent language games. Are we to believe that the \"use\" of
out-law dis- course by critics to disrupt dominant practices can fail to
do violence to these diverse/divergent logics? Are out-law discourses
merely tools to be exploited and discarded in the pursuit of returning
leftist academic dis- course to the center?

\(3\) Perhaps the academic translation of out-law discourse could be
true to the internal logic of the out-law community. And,
[[perhaps]{.mark} the [re-presentation]{.mark} of out-law logic within
the academic community [will bestow]{.mark} a degree of
**[legitimacy]{.mark}** on the out-law community. [**Nonetheless**, the
effect]{.mark} of legitimizing out-law discourse [is]{.mark} unknown and
potentially **[destructive]{.mark}**. In an effort [to
**siphon**]{.mark} **the political [energy]{.mark}** of out-law
discourse [into academic practice, we]{.mark} may ultimately
**[destroy]{.mark}** the dissatisfaction that serves as [a
**cathexis**]{.mark} for these out-law discourses]{.underline}. It seems
possible that [academic [recognition]{.mark} might [**take the place**
of]{.mark} struggle for [material opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline}
(see Fraser 1997). [[But, will]{.mark} academic [legitimation create
**any**]{.mark} **material [changes]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the
[conditions]{.mark} of out-law communities?]{.underline} I mean to
suggest, not that it is better to allow the out-law community to suffer
for its cause, but rather that incorporating the struggle into an
(admittedly) impotent academic critique does not offer a prima facie
alternative.

\(4\) Criticism of resistance denies the practical and theoretical
importance of opportunity. Returning to De Certeau\'s notion of tactics,
the crucial element of these discursive moves is their use of
opportunity to disrupt the proper authority of the dominant. The kairos
of intervention provides the key to undermining \"in-law\" discourses.
But when is the \"right moment in time\" for the academic reproduction
of out-law discourse? Mapping the points of resistance (ala Foucault and
Biesecker) entails interrogating \"in-law\" discourses for their
incongruities and contradictions, not turning the academic gaze upon
those communities waiting for an opportunity. Out-laws do not lurk in
the forefront (66), hoping to be exposed by academic critics; they wait
for the right moment for their disruption. Rhetoricians can provide
rhetorical instructions for seeking opportunities and for exploiting
these opportunities (literally making the culturally weaker argument the
stronger), but this does not justify interrogating (intervening in) the
cultural logics of the marginalized.

The concerns raised here are not designed to dismiss Sloop and Ono\'s
provocative essay. The divergent critical logic they outline deserves
careful consideration within the critical community, and it is my hope
that the concerns I raise may help to further problematize the
relationship between

resistance and rhetorical criticism.

Rhetorical criticism

As I have suggested, my purpose is to use the provocative nature of
Sloop and Ono\'s project to extend disputes regarding the ends of
rhetorical criticism. Diverging perspectives on the ends of criticism
have been categorized by Barbara Warnick (1992) as falling along four
general lines: artist, analyst, audience, and advocate. Leah Ceccarelli
(1997) discerns similar categories around the aesthetic, epistemic, and
political ends of rhetorical criticism.

The out-law discourse project presents clear ties to the notion of
critic as advocate. [For Sloop and Ono, the critic is an **interested
party**, discerning]{.underline} (and at times disputing) [the
underlying values and forces contained within a discourse. Additionally,
however, [the]{.mark} out-law discourse [critic is]{.mark} an analyst
[focusing on]{.mark} the **[hidden]{.mark}**]{.underline}, aberrant
[[texts]{.underline}]{.mark} of the out-law [[and
**\"rendering\]**]{.mark} **an incoherent or esoteric text
[comprehensible\"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Warnick 1992, 233). Now, I am
not suggesting that a critic must serve only one function or that the
roles of advocate and analyst are mutually exclusive; rather, [these
entanglings of power]{.underline} (political ends) [and
knowledge]{.underline} (epistemic ends) [are inevitable]{.underline}. My
concern is that we not neglect the complexity of these entanglements.
**[[Turning covert]{.mark} out-law [discourses into objects of]{.mark}
our [analyses]{.mark} runs the [risk]{.mark} of [subjecting them]{.mark}
both [to the gaze of the dominant and]{.mark} to [the power relations of
the academy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As the works of Michel Foucault
(especially 1979, 1980) aptly illustrate, practices presented as
extending such noble goals as emancipation and humanity may endow
institutions of confinement and objectification. Any justification for
studying out-law dis- course because doing so may extend our political
usefulness in the pursuit of emancipatory goals must not obscure the
already existing power relations authorizing such studies. Our attempts
to extend our domains of knowledge and expertise (authority) must not be
pursued unreflexively.

Finally, [because **[care can be mobilized]{.mark} as a way [to
privilege some groups at the expense of others, the "radical" aspect of
care]{.mark} [can bleed into right-wing and white supremacist
politics]{.mark}** as much as it upholds leftist utopian
visions]{.underline}. In describing her current book project on machine
learning and segregation, Discriminating Data: Neighborhoods,
Individuals, Proxies, media theorist Wendy Hui Kyong Chun argues that
social networking platforms rely on a logic of homophily: birds of a
feather flock together, so you will want to date, love, and be
neighborly with those who are just like you, who share your fundamental
values and interests.33 [**[The]{.mark} [problem with care]{.mark}**
attached to fellow feeling or sympathy **[is]{.mark} that** all too
often it means that **[care is reserved for those deemed
worthy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Cotten Seiler's article in this issue
underscores, **[[radical care is]{.underline}]{.mark}** also potentially
**[[dangerous]{.mark}: affective feelings of [compassion and
empathy]{.mark} [toward poor whites during the Great Depression, for
instance]{.mark}, [could]{.mark} [be]{.mark} used as [justifi­cation for
caring for fellow whites]{.mark} [over others]{.mark},]{.underline}**
despite the state-backed care offered by the New Deal. **[What happens
when images of suffering or violence fail to inspire warm feelings and
subsequent charitable action? [Care is unevenly distributed and *cannot
be disentangled* *from structural racism and
inequality*]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In addition to the kind of
commercialized co-optation of neoliberal self-care we describe above,
[political leaders also take advantage of stereotypes about caregiving
to extract unpaid labor from citizens.]{.underline} Care is a collective
capacity to build an alternative to colonialism and capitalism, **[[but
those in power]{.underline}]{.mark}** can also **[[instrumentalize
empathy and care to their own ends]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For example,
Andrea Muehlebach has shown how the post-Fordist Italian state valorizes
**[[and]{.mark} [manipulates compassion]{.mark} in order to absolve
itself of responsibility to its most marginalized
citizens]{.underline}**.34 [In]{.underline} the context of [[the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, the
American health [care]{.underline} and childcare [[systems]{.mark} are
kept afloat by a vast corpus of [unpaid or devalued]{.mark} domestic
work performed by [poor immigrant women and kin
members]{.mark}]{.underline}.35 [[Domestic]{.mark} [workers]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} some of the most [exploited]{.mark} workers]{.underline},
not just in the United States but [[globally]{.mark};]{.underline} in
Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Bangladesh they are [often poor migrant
women]{.underline} and [are [without labor unions or other
protections]{.mark}, often subjected to sexual assault and other forms
of violence]{.underline}.36 To be clear, the problems that radical care
seeks to remedy are not just a product of neoliberal policy or the
election of Donald Trump and other authoritarian leaders. Older
histories of settler colonialism and centuries of exploitation inform
the inequalities entangled with care today. As Leanne Betasamosake
Simpson and Dionne Brand put it, **["The monster has arrived, and the
monster was always here."]{.underline}**3

Philosopher Anna Carastathis (2013) recuperates one of Crenshaw's early
metaphors in order to illustrate this point. Crenshaw's (1989) metaphor
of a basement with a trap door illustrates how [[single-axis or
limited-axis movements]{.mark} may [fail people facing multiple systems
of oppression]{.mark}.]{.underline} By system of oppression, I mean
[[historical and institutionalized patterns that disadvantage a
particular group]{.mark} of people based on their social
identity]{.underline}. Systems of oppression include racism, sexism,
heterosexism, ableism and so forth. [In the 'basement' metaphor, 'all
people who are disadvantaged on the basis of race, sex, class, sexual
preference, age, and/or physical ability' occupy a basement with 'those
on the bottom being disadvantaged by the full array of factors, up to
the very top, where the heads of those disadvantaged by a singular
factor brush up against the ceiling']{.underline} (Crenshaw 1989, 151).
In Crenshaw's initial work on intersectionality, which examined why
Black women facing discrimination did not have legal recourse, White
women and Black men could say they would be out of the basement 'but
for' the ceiling. However, Black women faced two 'but fors' -- racism
and sexism -- and became legally invisible. [[Truly intersectional work
aims to address all]{.mark} of the [systems of oppression]{.mark} that
might leave someone in the metaphorical basement]{.underline}. The

work can avoid perpetuating ableism]{.mark}]{.underline}, the system
that oppresses people with nonnormative bodies and minds.

which]{.mark} thinking about [ableism and disablement can enrich
explanations of environmental injustice]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
Differential exposure and vulnerability -- the traffic crash
[Exposure]{.underline}. [[People with disabilities are specifically
exposed]{.mark} to]{.underline} and vulnerable to [environmental
injustice]{.underline} **[[as a result of
ableism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Just as people occupying marginalized
race and class positions are geographically segregated, so are [people
with disabilities more likely than those without to be geographically
segregated]{.underline}, unemployed or underemployed, and poor (Russell
1998; Hemingway and Priestley 2006). This makes people with disabilities
more likely to live in areas with disproportionate burden of
environmental bads, such as near current or legacy factory sites.
Moreover, those most likely to be subject to and bear the greatest
burdens of environmental injustice often occupy multiple marginalized
social locations. Scholars have demonstrated this with respect to
disability, gender and race in the case of Hurricane Katrina. [Hurricane
[Katrina]{.mark}]{.underline}, established in the academic literature as
an issue of EJ (Sze 2006), climate justice (Schlosberg and Collins 2014)
and racial justice (Elliott and Pais 2006), [[illustrates how disability
status contributed to the lived experiences]{.underline}]{.mark} of
people in New Orleans, and why Hurricane Katrina also [presented issues
of disability justice]{.underline} (Finger 2005; NCD 2005). Public
health researchers found that those, who did not evacuate 'lacked public
transportation, misjudged the storm, were limited by their own or a
family member's physical disability, and were more likely to be lifetime
New Orleans residents' (Brodie et al. 2006, 1407). Among those who were
evacuated, 27,000 people moved from the Superdome in New Orleans to the
Astrodome in Houston, Texas. Some of the arrivals had lost their
mobility devices and, until donated wheelchairs arrived, had difficultly
accessing the restrooms in the large arena, while other arrivals who see
and hear with different strategies than typically seeing and hearing
people had to adapt to the new environment until accessibility was
addressed after several days (Bloodworth et al. 2007). Lack of access to
disability-aware spaces and underestimation of disability-specific
supplies meant that evacuees were further harmed even after leaving the
hurricane area. Evacuation exacerbated previous chronic health
conditions as well given the extent to which lowincome people relied on
public hospitals decimated by the storm (Brodie et al. 2006). [**[A
disability justice framework understands that it is not people with
disabilities who are 'unprepared']{.underline}** [but
rather]{.underline}]{.mark} [ableism that has contributed to [a larger
system that has failed them]{.mark} and their families]{.underline}
(Fenney Salkeld 2016; Kim 2016, 198--212). Likewise, Hurricane Katrina
created conditions for further disablement. For example, demographer
Narayan Sastry and economist Jesse Gregory (2013) explicitly focus on
disability as an 'effect' of Hurricane Katrina -- making disability the
dependent variable and accounting for age, race and sex as independent
variables. Their analysis of data from the American Community Survey
revealed that the increase in disability in New Orleans was
disproportionately concentrated among young and middle-aged Black women,
with the young faring the worst. Sastry and Gregory draw on the extant
literature to review the potential factors contributing to multiple
marginalization -- [young black women were caught at the intersection of
race, gender and age in such a way that adverse outcomes
compounded]{.underline}. As [Black people]{.underline}, they [were more
likely to live in dwellings and communities that suffered the most
damage, leading to loss of property and neighborhood ties. As women,
they were more likely to be left with children after households broke
up, and the difficulties children in their care faced post-hurricane may
have been sources of stress and consequent mental health
effects.]{.underline} As young people, new mental and physical
impairments were more 6 C. JAMPEL Downloaded by \[66.189.72.133\] at

their effects on ability to work, having younger children not as easily
able to help with daily tasks such as shopping, and more limited access
to financial resources. In their explanation, the researchers imply a
contextual model of disablement as a result of historical processes.

**Environmental impacts are uniquely magnified against disabled bodies
-- only a critical intersectional lens towards political processes can
identify vulnerability**

Vulnerability. [[People whose bodies diverge from the 'normal']{.mark}
or 'standard']{.underline} may [[face greater exposure]{.mark} [to
environmental injustice]{.mark}]{.underline} than other people. For some
people, their bodily differences may also make them especially
vulnerable to the effects of certain environmentally unjust conditions.
[For example, [people who are immunosuppressed]{.mark}]{.underline} or
have biological variations such as 'slow acetylation' [[bear a greater
burden when exposed to **air pollution, pesticides, industrial
chemicals**]{.underline}]{.mark} and a host of other toxic trespasses, a
phrase Sandra Steingraber (2010, 279) uses to describe involuntary human
exposure to a pollutant. As she explains, people who are slow
acetylators have low levels of the enzymes that detoxify aromatic
amines, a class of organic compounds used in pesticides and strongly
associated with bladder cancer (2010, 268). [Slow(er) acetylation
becomes a disability]{.underline} when high level of aromatic amine
exposure is part of society and culture. **[Biological variation
compounded with racialized, classed and gendered exposures to toxics
demonstrates how [disability status ends up being created and then
exacerbated through a political-- economic
context]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As mainstream discourses shape an
understanding through which the most 'vulnerable populations' are
'expected' to be further impaired or harmed (Fjord 2007), a **[[critical
and intersectional EJ lens can direct attention toward the political
processes]{.underline}]{.mark}** th[at lead to unnecessary occupational

to situate algorithms in a socio-technical context and raise the
question of whether algorithms are appropriate instruments to measure
and shape certain domains in the first place. For instance, given
concerns about algorithms' ability to capture shifting, contextual
aspects of disability, what amount of discretion should they have over
disabled people's hiring outcomes, if any? While simply omitting groups
from algorithmic models would exacerbate inequality, there may be reason
to be much more skeptical of their inferences. Already, **[p[rotests by

**[[point to the ways in which data scientists can affect change beyond
the algorithm itself.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As such, **[[disability

situate algorithms in their socio-technical
context.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Moreover, **[[a disability justice
approach suggests that data scientists should critically analyze the
ways in which disability is defined, measured, and
labelled.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Given that most data about disability
are medical, inferences from them typically are limited to the medical
model, reducing disability to a biological dysfunction. Yet, **[[by
drawing on disability scholarship]{.mark}, [we]{.mark}]{.underline}**
can **[[uncover]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[ways]{.underline}]{.mark}** in which **[[these categories shift and
trace their roots to ableist assumptions.]{.underline}]{.mark}** For
instance, consider proposals to increase the amount and quality of
disability data by drawing from people's electronic health records.
While well-intentioned, these efforts would further entrench the medical
model of disability, leave little room for self-identification, and
underrepresent disabled people who lack access to health care. Making
explicit the ways in which algorithms model disability creates space to
imagine it differently through methods like value-sensitive design
(Friedman & Hendry,
[2019](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR35);
Simon et al.,
[2020](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR92)).
Such an approach melds conceptual, empirical, and technical elements,
e.g., assessing models of disability in terms of their assumptions,
impact on data gathering, relationship to outcomes, and so on. In so
doing, data scientists could better attend to the ways that different
models influence people's claims about their disabilities and how those
claims are mediated by intersecting hierarchies of class, race, and
gender. By **[[investigating how different definitions and measures of
disability shape who 'counts' as disabled, data scientists can intervene
in these ongoing omissions. This requires altering how disabilities are
operationalized so they are defined not solely as medical diagnoses but
also in terms of how people navigate institutions, norms, and each
other.]{.mark}]{.underline}** While fair-ML idealizes abstraction so
that data can be applied across contexts, (in)capacities emerge from a
multitude of contextual factors like competing values and built
environments. Instead, a disability justice framework suggests that
**[[an algorithm's accuracy does not always trade off with its ability
to accommodate contingency because many disabilities are intrinsically
situational and resist quantification.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Implementing this approach might involve, e.g., assigning more weight to
contextual factors, assessing how aspects of a given disability shift
over time, and designing scales that are sensitive to social values and
attitudes. For example, some researchers have demonstrated that
disability data can be disaggregated to more easily study the variables
that cooccur with certain disabilities or contexts (Brown & Broido,
[2020](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR15);
Peña et al.,
[2018](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR77)).
Others have called for analyzing how people's capacities expand and
contract in relation to built accessibility, office culture, and the
type of labor at hand (Bennett et al.,
[2020](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR9)).
This suggests that data scientists could model disability differently by
altering processes of data collection, label generation, and proxy
selection so as not to abstract away its context. In addition,
disability justice demands more fundamental shifts in access,
communication, and ownership across the AI design pipeline. Indeed, the
biases that hiring algorithms exhibit are inseparable from developers'
sole focus on employer values and widening asymmetries between firms and
applicants. Although applicants' ability to secure jobs is shaped by
these AI, they cannot examine or offer input on them easily, if at all.
[**[Expanding opportunities for these engagements and removing barriers
to access is essential to designing more equitable
algorithms]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Already, initiatives like Access
Computing offer accessible training in computer science (Trewin et al.,
[2019](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR99))
and groups like (Dis)Ability in AI provide support to disabled people at
conferences about AI (Whittaker et al.,
[2019](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR104)).
Despite efforts to increase disability representation at design forums
and in training datasets, [**[the mere]{.underline}** **[presence of
disability is not enough to transform existing institutions and restore
trust.]{.underline}**]{.mark} That is, **[[vendors must design with
disabled people]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not merely for them. As the
scope of design expands, data scientists ought to draw insights from
other disciplines, including disability studies and socio-technical
design, and team up with a wider range of stakeholders. This process
cannot simply tack on these perspectives but must integrate and consult
with them throughout the design pipeline. By collaborating with a
diverse array of disciplines and voices, data scientists could better
identify stakeholders in AI hiring, explore their values and needs,
study how AI might implicate them, and involve them in design processes.
This bears similarities to a participatory design perspective, in which
workers are empowered by directly influencing the design of technologies
they will take up (Korsgaard et al.,
[2016](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR54)).
Using a variety of techniques---from prototyping and mock-ups to
future-oriented workshops and scenarios---stakeholders reflect on the
situation, imagine innovative solutions, and transform those speculative
approaches into realistic, concrete alternatives. This might involve, to
give an example, asking stakeholders to evaluate whether automated
interviews that assess affect and gestures align with their values, what
they communicate about disabled applicants, and how they might be
navigated. In parallel, insights from disability studies suggest
granting disabled people's perspectives significant weight in debates
about, e.g., generating labels and selecting proxies for disability
status. For instance, developers might look to data platform co-ops
operated by people with rare disabilities, in which they oversee the use
of their data and share profits (Scholz,
[2016](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR86);
Treviranus,
[2018](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR97)),
to inform their own decisions about responsible data use. By working
alongside these other disciplines and voices from the start of the
design process, data scientists could help bridge gaps in knowledge,
foster a common conceptual language, and develop new research methods.
**[[Beyond expanding]{.underline}]{.mark}** the scope of **[[AI ethics
concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}**, redefining design values, and changing
stakeholder dynamics, a **[[disability justice approach suggests
pursuing policy measures that can empower data activism.]{.mark} [While
legislation often lags behind advances in computing, existing regulatory
uncertainty allows AI vendors to selectively endorse transparency and
fairness criteria in ways that preserve existing arrangements. Greater
transparency could help promote the conditions necessary for activists
and data scientists alike to study, uncover, and contest algorithmic
bias.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Despite the explanatory difficulties
associated with the black box, **[[policies ought to be introduced
mandating that AI developers regularly audit and
disclose]{.mark}]{.underline}** the purview, inputs and outputs, and
**[[limitations of their algorithms.]{.underline}]{.mark}** For example,
some have suggested requiring employers to make public the automated
inferences they make about applicants (Hoffman,
[2019a](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR72))
and tasking them with retaining detailed records of their bias
mitigation procedures (Hoffman,
[2019b](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR71)).
**[[Developing legislation to establish minimum standards for data
transparency and disclosure of bias mitigation measures---even for
opaque machine learning AI---is necessary to identify and make claims
against discriminatory algorithms.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In addition to
setting baselines for transparent design and implementation,
**[[recognizing how ableist structures can affect people's
identification with and disclosure of disability status highlights the
importance of more robust privacy regulations.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Existing protections are ill-equipped to grapple with the ethical risks
posed by automated hiring tools or predictions of disability status. The
ADA (1990) only shields those who are disabled, treated as disabled, or
were disabled, while GINA (2008) and HIPAA (OCR,
[2021](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR73))
protect health data while it is being stored, transferred, and analyzed
by certain classes of covered entities. However, since these laws
neither cover AI vendors and data brokers nor explicitly forbid
discrimination based on inferred risk factors for disabilities, AI can
circumvent them (Givens & Morris,
[2020](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR38)).
Similarly, while the ADA prohibits discrimination in places of public
accommodation, it does not explicitly include algorithms, social media
platforms, and so on (Rothstein,
[2020](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR82)).
Expanding existing privacy protections would help make disability
disclosure less precarious and, in so doing, assist efforts to gather
more representative datasets.
