#### Debates about transatlantic relations are good

More specifically, [past decades have produced a global power shift away
from transatlantic relations as the product of Western, state-driven
foreign policy in two respects]{.underline}. As to the first, whether or
not one believes the assertion of the dissolution of the Soviet Union
provided a unipolar moment for the United States in the early 1990s
(Mearsheimer 2019, Ikenberry 2014), undoubtedly the most significant
constituent and a sine qua non of any transatlantic relations, new
powers have emerged in the meantime and affect these relations
significantly. On a global level, in view of the massive increase in
military spending, the People's Republic of China is the first to be
mentioned, but on a regional level, Russia, India, Brazil, Turkey, Iran,
Saudi Arabia, and, certainly in a different fashion but nevertheless
relevant, the European Union, another important constituent part of the
so-called West, have all expressed different perspectives on and visions
of world order recently (Acharya 2017). Collectively, global power
shifts in favor of non-Western states can certainly be considered a
consensus within International Relations (IR). The same holds for the
assumption that this is accompanied by a -- relative -- loss of
importance of the West, specifically in light of President Trump's
disregard for multilateralism and the values of the liberal order as
such. Second, power on the international scene understood as the
capacity to have an impact on people's lives whether they want it or
not, is also shifted to and increasingly exerted by so-called non-state
actors and within intergovernmental organizations (Avant, Finnemore, and
Sell 2010). [This includes advocacy groups claiming moral high grounds
in global governance as well as multinational corporations, particularly
to but not exclusively from the technology sector (Alphabet/Google,
Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft to name but a
few).]{.underline} - 3 - Against this backdrop of a double power shift
away from the West and away from states, **[we do not believe that the
declining relative relevance of transatlantic relations as the internal
relationship of the West diminishes its relevance as an object of IR
research]{.underline}**. Rather, [assuming **discursive
importance**]{.underline} as a reference object and as political
practice, [we assume actors in and of **transatlantic** **relations**
respond to these challenges and]{.underline} thereby either reproduce or
[develop new aspects of said relations]{.underline}. For one thing, [we
do **not** assume **a zero-sum approach to power**]{.underline}. Under
the condition of an understanding of power as the enforcement of rules,
for instance, [the relative loss of power of a political entity can go
hand-in-hand with the entity striving to enforce a greater number of
rules in absolute terms than before]{.underline}. What these
rules-as-visions are about, then, remains important -- regardless of the
fact that others also (increasingly) have power and enforce (an even
more growing number of) rules. Moreover, it can be observed that in case
of [positional differences between the governments of the U.S. on the
one hand and (some) European states on the other hand, major **crises**
and the end of transatlantic relations are always **proclaimed** very
quickly (and alarmistically) -- **by politicians, journalists, but also
by IR scholars**]{.underline}. Crisis and catharsis, at least, seem to
be recurrent narratives of transatlantic relations, often originating
unreflectively within a hybrid discourse of practitioners and think
tanks, often derived from the notion that a new U.S. president
approaches transatlantic relations in a different light.1 The inherent
presentism of think tank thinking and political practice aside,
[**transatlantic relations** are thus still a much-noticed **object of
public debate and consideration** as they remain an issue quite
**affectively occupied and connected to normative assumptions, in the
West as well as beyond**. To **examine transatlantic relations** thus
also seems promising from this point of view.]{.underline}

#### NATO is good

**Coker 09**

(Christopher Coker is Professor of International Relations at the London
School of Economics and Political Science, 3-27-2009, \"Post-modern
NATO,\" Rusi,
<https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/post-modern-nato/>,
DOA July 21, 2022)

[**NATO has expanded beyond its initial notion of an Atlantic
community**. No longer is it delineated by the Iron Curtain, and the
Alliance has resisted calls to define itself against Islamic
fundamentalism.]{.underline} [NATO still needs a new self-understanding,
key to which will be a clearer sense of its relationship with
Russia.]{.underline} The Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges once
remarked that we are all confronted by the 'modesty of history'. In
plying their trade historians and political scientists try to identify
historic turning points and to date them precisely, but history is more
modest. Its essential dates remain secret for a long time. I cite Borges
because one of the decisive dates he chose, and one which moved him
profoundly (or so he tells us), was the liberation of Paris in August
1944. [For what he saw at the time was the conception of something new
-- **a western community** or coalition that **having triumphed over
fascism would stand firm against communism as well**]{.underline}. Had
Borges been alive today what dates would he have chosen for the
transformation of that community in its institutional form, the Atlantic
Alliance? Since the end of the Cold War NATO has changed profoundly[. If
we seek to date that change perhaps we should look to the Partnership
for Peace initiative of 1994; or the NATO-Russia Founding Act signed
three years later which placed the relationship between the West and its
old protagonist on a contractual footing; or the invitation at Madrid in
1999 to three East European countries to begin **the process of
enlargement**]{.underline}. One could choose all or any of these as
keystones in NATO's path to becoming a post-modern alliance. [Post
western alliance To claim that NATO has become a post-western alliance
may strike one as at best ironic, at worst plainly
perverse]{.underline}. At the Washington Conference in 1949 one of the
participants Paul Henri Spaak called it 'an act of faith in the destiny
of western civilization'. It is worth remembering[, in fact, that the
alliance was meant to be more than a military alliance**. Its founding
fathers hoped to forge an Atlantic Community as Christian
Herter**]{.underline}, **[John Foster Dulles' successor at the State
Department called it.]{.underline}** At the end of the 1950s, in fact,
the United States fought to give the alliance a federal framework -- a
permanent council elected by the NATO Council of Ministers; a political
general staff or steering committee, or Atlantic Commission. In the end,
an Atlantic Community was not forged. Instead, the United States and
Europe began drifting apart. [As Walter Hallstein, the President of the
European Commission remarked in 1961, the Europeans were no longer
interested in the Alliance as a 'collective political personality'; they
were interested only in a loose association based on two separate
pillars -- Europe and the United States]{.underline}. Yet until the very
end of the Cold War, **[the Alliance's 'Western' credentials were
constantly reaffirmed:]{.underline}** in the Atlantic Declaration of
1974 and most recently the Transatlantic Declaration of 1990[. Even
after the collapse of communism and long before 9/11 there was **still a
hope** that **NATO** would remain a western club, by **defining itself
against another universal enemy: Islam**. In the attack by Islamic
fundamentalists on western culture many observers seemed to be confirmed
in their conviction that the worlds of secularism and Islam were as
fundamentally incompatible as those of capitalism and communism. **In
Islamic fundamentalism many commentators saw another existential threat
to western civilization**]{.underline}. In the event, the attempt in
February 1995 by the NATO Secretary-General, Willie Claes, to reaffirm
the alliance on that basis met with little or no support. History has
now moved on. Willie Claes' 'Huntingdonian' predilection for seeing it
in cultural terms was not wrong in itself, but **[the clash of
civilizations thesis is based on a very modern definition of
civilization]{.underline}**. [**The idea of civilization which the West
fought so hard to impose on its enemies can no longer be sustained.** It
now refers to a distinctive mode of existence in the global age, not an
ideal order of human society.]{.underline} [It is no longer possible to
insist that the peoples of the world are living through a stage in a
unitary scale of progress **whose apex is western
civilization**]{.underline}. Indeed, long before the Cold War had run
its course this had been conceded by no less a figure than Raymond Aron.
Aron shared none of his own countrymen's fears of American hegemony or
their aversion to Anglo-Saxon universalism. [He would be among the first
to applaud his country's return to NATO's integrated military
command.]{.underline} [But he recognized that if civilization itself was
to be defended in the future against fundamentalist forces that
challenged everything that made life 'civil' the West would have to be
less exclusive in its definition.]{.underline} 'The present phase of
civilization is coming to an end', he wrote in the 1960's, 'and for good
or ill humanity is embarking on a new phase,' that of forging a single
world civilization for the first time, one truly universal in its
appeal. [What Aron recognized was that every culture - to take one
critical example, human rights - must realize values in its own way. He
recognized that the whole debate on human rights had been bedeviled for
far too long by western ideas]{.underline}. [There is no global
consensus on what constitutes those rights **but NATO is trying to
demarcate what President Bush called 'the non-negotiable demands of
human freedom'.**]{.underline} In 1996 in a speech in Aachen Vaclav
Havel defined what the term 'civilization' meant in the post-modern era.
Like Aron he talked of a new West, a wider one, though still
distinguished by 'a metaphysically anchored sense of responsibility'.
[The West's task, he argued, should be to rededicate itself to a
different project -- to admit that there are values which transcend the
West itself; to find what it has in common with other cultures; 'to join
forces with them in search for the common moral minimum necessary to
guide us'.]{.underline} Let me highlight two key phrases from that
speech. **[NATO must have a normative purpose in the twenty-first
century, or what Havel calls 'a metaphysically anchored sense of
responsibility']{.underline}**. [**But in a post-modern age it cannot
have a maximalist one: the desire to impose a western definition of
civilized norms**. The 'moral minimum' is what it must aim for. This is
not a minimalist objective, however, for it requires the alliance to
intervene for the first time on behalf of those who are not even
members]{.underline}. It did this in Kosovo in 1999, the alliance's
first war. It is attempting to do this in Afghanistan today, in its
second military venture. [Post Atlantic Alliance To call NATO a
post-Atlantic Alliance may appear equally perverse given its decision to
forge a Euro-Atlantic Partnership and a Euro-Atlantic Council but both
of these were conjured into existence for a reason]{.underline}. i.e.
'Atlanticism' as it was traditionally understood is no longer
sustainable. For most of its history, of course, NATO was an Atlanticism
institution whose founding document was not the Washington Treaty of
1949 but the Atlantic Charter of 1941 to which the United States put its
name four months before it entered the Second World War. The Charter was
not only a statement of principle signed by Britain and the United
States. The British signed it on behalf of all but one of the European
governments in exile in London. The exception, France, only signed in
December 1944 -- three months after its liberation (so Borges, perhaps,
was right after all, to date the conception of the Atlantic Alliance --
as opposed to its birth -- to the liberation of Paris[). In the words of
André Malraux, the Old and New Worlds had been divided by the Atlantic,
an ocean which had provided a passage for those fleeing political and
economic oppression in Europe**. In the 1940s the immigration largely
stopped. The Atlantic became a bridge, not a barrier. In that sense, the
Old World was conjoined with the New.**]{.underline} **[The Atlantic
Alliance was lauded precisely for that reason. It offered, wrote the
contemporary historian Hans Kohn, a vehicle through which 'the nations
on the two shores of the Atlantic' had begun to realise their
communality for the first time.]{.underline}** Although they had not
shared a common past they would, at least, share a common destiny.
[Atlanticism grew naturally out of the politics and sympathies forged in
two World Wars]{.underline}. It was consistent with the very 'modern'
belief that countries were not states so much as contracts with history.
What was the United States, asked the poet William Carlos Williams, but
'the inspired invention of European thought'. In the political sphere
Atlanticism was a also a corner stone of Britain's supposed 'special
relationship' with the United States. But it was also vitally important
in helping the United States understand itself. [For the American
elite's idea of national consensus at the time was also in step with the
popular response to assimilation.]{.underline} [Indeed, the East and
Central Europeans who began arriving after 1910 only to find themselves
discriminated against as 'non-whites' were the first to benefit from
Atlanticism]{.underline}. **[For at its core was the belief in the force
of equality. That ideology, in turn, became a mainstay of the
government's own effort of mobilisation]{.underline}**. It facilitated
its attempt to unite the nation behind the rhetoric of the Cold War. It
marked the historic moment when the 'ghetto-whites': the Slovaks, Poles
and Ruthenians felt fully accepted as Americans. It was all the more
ironic, therefore, that the Atlanticism which helped end social
divisiveness within the US and unite the United States should have
divided western and eastern Europe. [In closing the gap between the old
and new worlds, Atlanticism widened the gap between the two in the
western imagination. The decision forty years later to enlarge NATO was
important for that reason]{.underline}. It spelt the end of what the
historian Norman Davies calls 'the Allied version of history' -- the
belief in a unique, secular brand of western civilisation in which the
Atlantic Alliance was presented as the pinnacle of human progress with
the Atlantic Charter as its key. [The Allied version of history was
pernicious precisely because it drew an imaginary line behind which the
West deemed itself to be more progressive, advanced and civilised. The
Hungarian writer Istvan Bibo was probably right to suspect in 1946 -
even before the Iron Curtain was drawn across the continent - that many
westerners were not unhappy to see Eastern Europe policed by a great
power, in part because they suspected its people of 'an innate
barbarism'.]{.underline} It is now clear, of course, that many fault
lines have shaped the history of Europe. Some run north/south and divide
the members of 'old Europe'. The lukewarm support for the Kosovo war in
the south, and 85 per cent support ratings in the Nordic world
highlighted the differences[. It is symbolically fitting that NATO
should have become the instrument by which Eastern and Western Europe
(and the United States, with its large and politically important East
European minorities) **have rediscovered each other**]{.underline}. It
is morally important that the Czech Republic has embraced what Havel
once described as "the poetic charm" of NATO membership. The phrase
reminds me of a passage in the novel Life is Elsewhere by his fellow
countryman, Milan Kundera. Referring to the coup of 1948 which his
generation welcomed as a new dawn, Kundera reflects that 'the wall
behind which people were imprisoned was made of verse'**[. The new
poetics of history is no longer communism but European integration, and
instead of imprisoning people behind a conceptual wall, it offers them a
wider horizon]{.underline}**. Is the process of NATO expansion complete?
Should the Alliance admit Georgia and Ukraine? Historically and
culturally neither have been 'European' -- they have always been on the
margins (if that) of the western imagination. [The same cannot be said
of Russia. Alliance without borders Throughout the Cold War NATO and the
Warsaw Pact found themselves locked into a position of strategic
inertia]{.underline}. History in the twentieth century, wrote the
philosopher Walter Benjamin, was a permanent state of emergency. And
like all such states it demanded a suspension of action, (though not, of
course, belief). [The very concept of movement, Benjamin added, had
become associated with the notion of catastrophe -- 'the fact that
things move on is the catastrophe' he warned.]{.underline} History since
then has become the permanent revision of what has been achieved, and
this is no less true in the security field than every other. [In today's
Europe 'the structure of peace' is no longer based on two opposing
military blocs deterring each other from breaking the peace. **Today's
Europe is characterized by change: the transformation of the security
environment is the principal theme of politics and security
studies.**]{.underline} The old system was built on the principle of
power restraining power. Great emphasis was based on drawing lines in
the sand. Today the emphasis is on inter-penetration and transparency.
The British diplomat Robert Cooper describes its chief characteristics
[: the break down the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs
the growth of mutual interference in traditional domestic affairs and
mutual surveillance]{.underline}. Intrusive verification which is at the
heart of the news arms control regime is a key element of a global order
in which state sovereignty is no longer considered to be absolute. the
rejection of force for resolving disputes, and the codification of rules
of behavior the growing irrelevance of borders the extent to which
security is based on transparency, mutual openness, interdependence and
mutual vulnerability [One of NATO's twenty-first century missions is to
help construct a community in which common identities are constituted by
normative practices other than national sovereignty; and in which people
find themselves involved in the life of the region as well as their own
country**. NATO shares that task with other institutions, especially the
OSCE which is also trying to forge a common security perspective or
'single cognitive space'.**]{.underline} Peace in Europe is now
maintained by the institutional synergy of several security
organizations of which NATO is one. The OSCE is another. If anything,
the Russians take the OSCE more seriously than most western countries,
or, at least, claim to. Some time ago Vladimir Lukin, the chairman of
the Duma International Affairs Committee, suggested that the second
phase of NATO enlargement should include all the participating members
of the OSCE (including Russia), and that thereafter, the organization
should dissolve itself and become the OSCE's military arm. This is
unlikely to happen but the West needs to find some more permanent basis
for its relationship with Russia. For synergy is a process not a
product. Each institution increases the effectiveness of the other; it
is the relationship between them which enhances each. Since 1991 we have
seen the emergence of the Russia-NATO Council. There was also talk of a
joint NATO-Russia brigade. The alliance has put much of its history
behind it; it has embraced globalization with some real success; it has
fought one war and finds itself involved in another. But for good or
ill, the relationship with Russia is still crucial to the new alliance
NATO is in the process of becoming. Until it is resolved we will not
know what the alliance will finally become.

### TVA

#### Plan: The United States Federal Government should substantially increase security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the area of cybersecurity by imposing regulations on data extraction

#### Regulation is key to solve the consequences of surveillance capitalism -- only working with both tech and regulations can solve

Turning now to what could be done, one goal should be to [[limit the
damage done]{.mark} by the surveillance capitalism business model,
[while still retaining key benefits of the services]{.mark} it
provides]{.underline}. But if possible, we would like to [[move beyond
damage control and support positive visions]{.mark} of how IT can better
support people and communities]{.underline}. Crafting and deploying such
solutions is an exceedingly difficult problem. Even though this business
model has only recently come into being, the corporations practicing it
have become dominant, and the technologies and services are threaded
throughout our lives, communities, and economies. [[Regulation will be a
key element]{.mark} of a response]{.underline}. However, [regulation
should not simply be a reaction to technology]{.underline} and an
attempt to curb its worst excesses: [[technology should not be taken as
a fixed, external force that will inevitably follow a particular
path]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Nor is surveillance capitalism at its root
a technological problem]{.mark} amenable to a purely technological
fix.]{.underline} Instead, [[regulation and technology should be
co-designed and co-evolved]{.underline}]{.mark}. Citizens and civil
society organizations will play key roles as well, by [pushing for more
effective regulation and supporting technologies, by helping to foster
alternative models for providing needed services, and by adopting new
social practice.]{.underline}

Regulation and law

Regulation and law form key elements of possible solutions. [We suggest
four principal goals for regulation: [protecting privacy]{.mark},
[erecting barriers to behavior manipulation]{.mark}, [protect]{.mark}ing
[free speech and civic participation, and]{.mark} (probably most
controversially) [undermining the economic basis of the surveillance
capitalism business model]{.mark} so that alternatives can take root and
flourish]{.underline}. Having such alternatives should lessen the
dependence on these IT companies, while still having a way that people
and society can have access to useful IT services -- and beyond this,
support positive visions of the role of IT in communities and society.

#### Informed consent and the minimum data approach protect our personal information while browsing -- this limits the damage of surveillance capitalism

**Landwehr, Borning & Wulf 21** -- \[Marvin Landwehr is a Ph.D. student
for Pluralist Economics and Socio-Informatics at the University of
Siegen, Alan Borning is a Professor Emeritus in the Paul G Allen School
of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington,

Another area of legislative activity is [do-not-track
legislation]{.underline}. The general goal of these bills is to [allow
users to decide whether or not they are willing to be tracked by
third-party websites while browsing websites and potentially while using
other internet-based services]{.underline}.

True informed consent

One reaction to privacy concerns is to implement much stronger
requirements for informed consent, of which the GDPR is one important
example. [Improving information and consent is]{.underline} certainly a
good thing, but in our view is [inadequate]{.underline}. Being deluged
with pages and pages of consent agreements about what information is
being gathered about you isn\'t that useful, and if the alternatives are
to check the 'agree' box, or to be left out of a great deal of social
and political interaction, this is not a particularly meaningful choice.
However, [stronger implementations of consent are possible.]{.underline}

As a thought experiment, suppose that [surveillance capitalist
corporations were required to operate under the same conditions that
govern research involving human subjects]{.underline}. For example, in
response to past abuses, [the US government adopted the Belmont
Report]{.underline} (1978), which laid out [principles for human
subjects research]{.underline}. It [requires true informed consent,
which must be voluntary and ongoing]{.underline}. That implies that the
[consent form must be straightforward and comprehensible]{.underline} --
so [no 30 page legal monstrosity]{.underline} as with typical corporate
privacy statements -- and the [subject must be able to withdraw from the
experiment at any time]{.underline}. Further, [only data needed to
conduct the study should be gathered, and must be deleted once the study
is over and analysis is complete]{.underline}. [The data must also be
held confidential and protected]{.underline} -- it would be forbidden,
for example, to hand it over to another research group without consent.

[If similar requirements were placed on surveillance capitalist firms,
they would require true informed consent, the ability to withdraw ones
data at any time, and would not allow the data to be shared without
permission with a third party]{.underline}. People should be able to
challenge inaccurate information and have it removed. Note that [today
people do not even have access to a transparent overview of how their
private data is trapped, transferred, sold and aggregated]{.underline}.
Therefore, as a prerequisite, [these data pathways need to be visible
for the user and the public regulators]{.underline}.

Further, in analogy with the human research requirements, only the data
needed to provide the service in question could be gathered, but not the
cloud of additional data that is gathered and retained as at present. In
other words, [what we advocate includes]{.underline} (but is not limited
to[) the concept of 'minimum data]{.underline}.' These [corporations
should not be allowed to collect data that is not necessary to provide
their service]{.underline}. However, minimum data alone could still
leave loopholes for service providers, e.g., they could claim all
personal data collected is necessary for AI-powered algorithms to
provide a service optimized to personal needs. Therefore, [true informed
consent in analogy with human research requirements exceeds the minimum
data approach]{.underline}. Finally, the [requirements should be much
stronger for children and vulnerable populations]{.underline} (e.g.,
prisoners). For example, in many cases the [companies should simply not
be allowed to accumulate information on children.]{.underline}

#### The plan is key to interoperability -- it's the only way to reduce the user's dependence on monopoly organizations

**Landwehr, Borning & Wulf 21** -- \[Marvin Landwehr is a Ph.D. student
for Pluralist Economics and Socio-Informatics at the University of
Siegen, Alan Borning is a Professor Emeritus in the Paul G Allen School

accessed 7/19/22; Lowell-JL\]

Adversarial interoperability

The current IT landscape is dominated by a very small number of
companies in monopoly positions. [Breaking up monopolies would be a
useful step in ensuring that users are not too dependent on a single
service provider]{.underline}. However, in our view, simply splitting
Facebook, for example, into six mini-Facebooks, each with the same
surveillance capitalism business model, would not be a particularly
effective approach. [Better would be to break up companies along
functional lines and to regulate the exchange of information among these
now-third-party entities]{.underline}. For instance, Facebook could be
required to divest from the essentially unrelated parts of its business,
including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. However, just
doing that, each sub-company could hold a monopoly in its niche, so a
comprehensive approach must go further. And given the network effect and
the resulting centralization mentioned above, which are prevalent for
Internet platforms, reverting to a monopoly situation is the most likely
outcome without additional regulation and oversight.

[Interoperability is one key to reducing the user\'s dependence on the
corporation or organization providing the service, as well as increasing
the ability of small competitors to improve upon single features or to
serve specialized markets]{.underline}. In his recent book How to
Destroy Surveillance Capitalism, Doctorow (2020) uses the term
'adversarial interoperability' (or 'competitive compatibility'
(Doctorow, 2021)), capturing that [interoperability cannot be expected
to be implemented voluntarily by for-profit companies if doing so might
reduce their profits]{.underline}. But having such [interoperability
would make it easier for for-profit competitors to enter the market, as
well as nonprofit or public entities]{.underline}, and therefore should
be legally enforced. Doctorow (2020) argues:

'If our concern is how corporations are foreclosing on our ability to
make up our own minds and determine our own futures, the impact of
dominance far exceeds the impact of manipulation and should be central
to our analysis and any remedies we seek.'

His position that [enforcing antitrust legislation in this domain is an
important one]{.underline}, although we would add that [protecting
against surveillance and manipulation is equally important]{.underline}.

[Antitrust law may provide a suitable means for motivating requirements
for adversarial interoperability]{.underline}. We are not experts in the
law, but we can say that it will probably not be enough to apply
existing antitrust law consistently to the case of IT services; [new
regulations will also have to be added]{.underline}. For example,
antitrust law as currently interpreted aims at enforcing fair prices for
customers. This does not cover the case of free applications, in other
words, the users who should be protected are not even the customers in
this case.

#### The organizations are supported by advertising -- profit will still be available

**Landwehr, Borning & Wulf 21** -- \[Marvin Landwehr is a Ph.D. student
for Pluralist Economics and Socio-Informatics at the University of
Siegen, Alan Borning is a Professor Emeritus in the Paul G Allen School

accessed 7/19/22; Lowell-JL\]

For-profit corporations

One option is for-profit corporations. We earlier suggested that [the
shift from context specific to targeted advertising marks the location
of a suitable line to draw and challenge surveillance capitalism by
prohibiting advertising based on personal profiling]{.underline}.
However, for-profit corporations [could continue to offer these
services, supported by advertising, including context-specific
advertising, just without personal profiling]{.underline}. Another
funding option is fee-for-service. These [options are thus still very
much capitalism, just not surveillance capitalism]{.underline}.

[There are existing corporations that use these models.]{.underline} Two
systems to be noted in particular are Brave2 and DuckDuckGo3. Brave is
an open-source browser that (the company says) blocks ads and trackers,
in both mobile and desktop versions. The DuckDuckGo search engine,
according to the company, does not collect or share personal
information. Its business model is still based on advertising (and also
affiliate marketing).

Another option is to [nudge the market by having institutions such as
libraries, universities, and others buy ad-free, no tracking versions of
services for their patrons/students, either from new companies, or from
existing large IT corporations if they are willing to unbundle their
services to support this.]{.underline} (Note that it would be essential
to monitor the corporations carefully to ensure they are not tracking
these users (Farivar, 2016; Peterson, 2015).)

### Advocacy Fails

#### Companies backlash by lobbying

Since these measures directly attack the power position of IT companies,
[countermeasures are to be expected,]{.underline} [including extensive
lobbying and media campaigns]{.underline}, as well as the continuing
instrumentalization of intellectual property laws. For example, even if
an IT service was involved in the creation of content, it should not be
granted any intellectual property rights to it. Otherwise, Facebook, for
example, could use intellectual property law to prevent users from
scraping their own content and uploading it onto competing systems. The
same is true for cloud computing providers. Therefore, [IP restrictions
are quite consequential and must be considered in responding to the
expected countermeasures]{.underline}. However, intellectual property is
just one way in which law is used to create abstract forms of capital.
In her recent book The Code of Capital, Pistor (2020) shows how the law
selectively codes claims and ideas into capital. All of these forms need
to be considered as expected legal countermeasures big companies will
apply against regulation. Furthermore, [investigations and
whistleblowers will be necessary for identifying
misconduct.]{.underline} As a consequence, there should be compensation
paid, and since one of the aggrieved parties is society as a whole, it
is easily justifiable to channel this compensation into the development
of alternatives, as one source for funding for them.
