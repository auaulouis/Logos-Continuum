You know what? **[[This isn't about your feelings. A human life]{.mark},
with all its joys and all its pains]{.underline}**, **[[adding up over
the course of decades, is worth far more than your brain's feelings of
comfort or discomfort with a plan]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Does
computing the expected utility feel too cold-blooded for your
taste?]{.underline}** **[Well, [that feeling isn't even a feather in the
scales, when a life is at stake.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Just shut up and
multiply. A googol is 10\^100---a 1 followed by one hundred zeroes. A
googolplex is an even more incomprehensibly large number---it's
10\^googol, a 1 followed by a googol zeroes. Now [pick some trivial
inconvenience, like a hiccup, and some decidedly untrivial misfortune,
like getting slowly torn limb from limb by sadistic mutant sharks. If
we're forced into a choice between either preventing a googolplex
people's hiccups, or preventing a single person's shark attack, which
choice should we make]{.underline}? [If you assign any negative value to
hiccups, then, on pain of decision-theoretic incoherence, there must be
some number of hiccups that would add up to rival the negative value of
a shark attack.]{.underline} [For any particular finite evil, there must
be some number of hiccups that would be even worse]{.underline}.

[[Moral dilemmas like these **aren't conceptual blood sports**]{.mark}
for keeping analytic philosophers entertained at dinner
parties.]{.underline} **[They're distilled versions of the kinds of
situations we actually find ourselves in every day.]{.underline}**
Should I spend \$50 on a console game, or give it all to charity? Should
I organize a \$700,000 fundraiser to pay for a single bone marrow
transplant, or should I use that same money on mosquito nets and prevent
the malaria deaths of some 200 children?

Yet **[[there are many who avert their gaze from the real world's
abundance of unpleasant moral tradeoffs]{.underline}]{.mark}**---many,
too, who take pride in looking away. Research shows that [people
distinguish "sacred values," like human lives, from "unsacred values,"
like money.]{.underline} [When]{.underline} [you try to trade off a
sacred value against an unsacred value, subjects express great
indignation]{.underline}. (Sometimes they want to punish the person who
made the suggestion.)

[My favorite anecdote along these lines comes from a team of researchers
who evaluated the effectiveness of a certain project, calculating the
cost per life saved, and recommended to the government that the project
be implemented because it was cost-effective. The governmental agency
rejected the report because, they said, you couldn't put a dollar value
on human life. After rejecting the report, the agency decided not to
implement the measure]{.underline}.

Trading off a sacred value against an unsacred value feels really awful.
[To merely multiply utilities would be too cold-blooded---it would be
following rationality off a cliff]{.underline} . . . But **[[altruism
isn't the warm fuzzy feeling you get from being
altruistic.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [If you're doing it for the spiritual
benefit, **that is nothing but selfishness. [The primary thing is to
help others, whatever the means. So shut up and
multiply]{.mark}**[!]{.mark}]{.underline}

**"Infinite risks," "anti-knowledge," and paralysis are
[wrong]{.underline}** \-\-- even if assigning risk is hard, the
alternative is to forego it entirely

**Rendall 17** \[Matthew Rendall, Lecturer in Politics and International
Relations at the University of Nottingham Political Science degree from
Columbia University, "PASCALIAN WAGERING AND CATASTROPHIC RISK: THE
WEITZMAN-NORDHAUS DEBATE", 5/9/17,

Jonas, however, feared not only the physical destruction of humanity but
also losing 'the essence of man'. His imperative also forbids taking any
risks with the latter.37 Depending on how we interpret 'the essence of
man', this might give it a much broader scope.38 Indeed, Jonas
maintained that there were many "apocalyptic" threats, whether nuclear
weapons or nuclear reactors.39 Interpreted that way, [the imperative may
**seem to threaten** the **same paralysis** as]{.underline} does
**[Pascal's Wager]{.underline}**.40 Nordhaus warns that if we attached
infinite disutility to existential risks, it could be rational to fight
preventive wars to prevent barely discerned power shifts in the far
future.41 [If the imperative of responsibility is to avoid paralysis and
paranoia, its scope must be restricted to a small number of truly
apocalyptic risks]{.underline}.42

[While]{.underline} it is true that nearly [anything we do could **in
principle** prove catastrophic, [in most cases we have no]{.mark} more
[reason to believe]{.mark} that [acting is riskier than abstaining. It
is often more dangerous]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [[to
launch]{.mark} preventive [wars than to forego]{.mark}
them]{.underline}. With climate change, on the other hand, we have a
well-theorized causal mechanism, with good theoretical and empirical
reasons for believing that higher greenhouse gas concentrations are more
dangerous than lower ones.43 [There are a small number of other
apocalyptic threats that fall into this category---notably thermonuclear
war---but for now there are not scores or hundreds.]{.underline}44

Still, there might be many actions for which we can construct a
theoretically possible, albeit improbable, story of how they could lead
to doom, and that seem slightly more likely than not to bring on the
apocalypse. To adapt an example of Jon Elster's, it is conceivable that
commercial TV transmissions will attract visitors from outer space.
While such extraterrestrials might either save the earth from some other
threat or destroy it, it is unlikely that these probabilities exactly
cancel each other out. [[In the absence of **reliable
info**]{.mark}**rmation**, [it is **rational** to]{.mark}]{.underline}
make [use of **[whatever]{.mark} information** [we]{.mark} do
[have]{.mark}---**[even]{.mark} if**]{.underline} it is merely a [flimsy
analogy or [a vague hunch]{.mark}.]{.underline} Suppose we judge---very
tentatively---that the chance that alien visitors will destroy the earth
is slightly greater than that they will destroy it. Should this be a
decisive consideration in whether or not to broadcast The Simpsons?45

Intuitively, the question seems absurd, but we should not reject it out
of hand. In other contexts [[when policies]{.mark} appear to [carry **a
small chance** of **apocalyptic destruction** they should be taken
**seriously**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and sometimes are. [[It was
reasonable]{.underline}]{.mark} for Compton [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
take into [[account]{.mark} the chance]{.underline} that [[the]{.mark}
atomic [bomb would ignite the]{.mark} earth's
[atmosphere]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**even if**]{.mark} it was only on
the order of **[three in a million]{.mark}**. It is
**reasonable**]{.underline} today [to consider]{.underline} the
possibility that [particle accelerators might destroy]{.underline} the
earth in deciding whether to run them.46 The TV transmission question
may seem absurd because we are by now accustomed to television
broadcasts, and they have become an integral part of modern societies.
That does not show that they are safe. It may instead indicate that
**[[the industrial revolution]{.underline}]{.mark}** has [[led
to]{.mark} **the [prolif]{.mark}eration** [of **ex**]{.mark}**istential
[risks]{.mark}**. The Stern Review estimated **a ten percent chance** of
**human extinction per century**]{.underline}. Surely no British
government before the twentieth century, had it considered the matter at
all, would have assessed the risk as nearly this high.47

Even if the number of apocalyptic threats to which we must respond is
presently circumscribed, with technological development it is likely to
grow. In that case the imperative of responsibility could become far
more confining.48 Yet in a nightmare world where existential risks had
become common, what could we reasonably do but exercise extreme caution?
Perhaps the problem is not that the imperative of responsibility is too
restrictive, but that technological development is too dangerous. We
should not take for granted that industrialization story has a happy
ending.49 [[If **century after century** we]{.mark} continue to
[run]{.mark} **even [small]{.mark} existential [risks]{.mark}**, sooner
or later, [we are bound to lose]{.mark} the gamble]{.underline}.50

Ironically, Taber and Lodge's experiments confirmed all six of the
authors' prior hypotheses. Perhaps you will say: "The experiment only
reflects the beliefs the authors started out with---it is just a case of
confirmation bias." If so, then [by making you a more sophisticated

[Heuristics and [biases are widespread]{.mark} in human reasoning.
Familiarity with heuristics and biases can enable us to detect a wide

[But]{.mark}]{.underline}, as with any ability to detect flaws in
reasoning, [this [inspection must be applied]{.mark} evenhandedly: both
[to our own ideas and]{.mark} the ideas of [others]{.mark}]{.underline};
to ideas which discomfort us and to ideas which comfort us. [Awareness

[Every true idea which discomforts you will seem to match the pattern of
at least one psychological error]{.underline}.

Robert Pirsig said: "The world's biggest fool can say the sun is
shining, but that doesn't make it dark out." [[If you believe someone is
guilty of a psychological error, then demonstrate your competence by
first demolish]{.mark}ing [their]{.mark} consequential [factual errors.
If there are no factual errors, then what matters the
psychology]{.mark}? The temptation of psychology is that, knowing a
little psychology, we can meddle in arguments where we have no technical
expertise]{.underline}---instead sagely analyzing the psychology of the
disputants.

If someone wrote a novel about an asteroid strike destroying modern
civilization, then someone might criticize that novel as extreme,
dystopian, apocalyptic; symptomatic of the author's naive inability to
deal with a complex technological society. [We should [recognize this as
a literary criticism, not a scientific one]{.mark}; it is about good or
bad novels, not good or bad hypotheses. To [quantify
the]{.mark}]{.underline} annual [[probability]{.underline}]{.mark} of an
asteroid strike in real life, [[one must study]{.underline}]{.mark}
astronomy and the historical record: [no amount of literary criticism
can put a number on it]{.underline}. Garreau (2005) seems to hold that a
scenario of a mind slowly increasing in capability, is more mature and
sophisticated than a scenario of extremely rapid intelligence increase.
But [that's a technical question, not a matter of taste; no amount of
psychologizing can tell you the exact slope of that curve]{.underline}.

It's harder to abuse heuristics and biases than psychoanalysis. Accusing
someone of conjunction fallacy leads naturally into listing the specific
details that you think are burdensome and drive down the joint
probability. Even so, [do not lose track of the real-world facts of
primary interest]{.underline}; [do not let the argument become about
psychology]{.underline}.

Thinking about Extreme Events," Fall, Social Research 75.3, JSTOR\]

In scholarly work, the subfield of disasters is often seen as narrow.
One reason for this is that a lot of scholarship on disasters is
practically oriented, for obvious reasons, and the social sciences have
a deep-seated suspicion of practical work. This is especially true in
sociology. Tierney (2007b) has treated this topic at length, so there is
no reason to repeat the point here. There is another, somewhat
unappreciated reason that [work on disaster is seen as
**narrow**]{.underline}, a reason that holds some irony
[for]{.underline} the main thrust of my argument here: [disasters are
unusual and]{.underline} the [[social sciences are]{.mark}]{.underline}
generally [[**biased** toward phenomena that are frequent.]{.mark}
Methods textbooks caution against]{.underline} using case stud- ies as
representative of anything, and [articles]{.underline} in mainstreams
journals that are [not based on]{.underline} [probability
samples]{.underline} must issue similar obligatory caveats. [The
premise, **itself narrow**, is that the only way to be
certain]{.underline} that we know something about the social world, and
the only way to control for subjective influences in data acquisition,
[is to follow]{.underline} the tenets of [probabilistic
sampling]{.underline}. This view is a correlate of the central way of
defining rational action and rational policy in academic work of all
varieties and also in much practical work, which is to say in terms of
probabilities. [The irony is that [probabilistic thinking **has its own
biases**, which]{.mark}, if unacknowledged and uncorrected]{.underline}
for, [**[lead to]{.mark} a [conceptual neglect]{.mark}** [of extreme
events]{.mark}]{.underline}. This leaves us, as scholars, paying
attention to disasters only when they happen and doing that makes the
accumulation of good ideas about disaster vulnerable to issue-attention
cycles (Birkland, 2007). [These [**conceptual blinders** lead to a
neglect of disasters]{.mark}]{.underline} [as \"strategic research
sites]{.underline}\" (Merton, 1987), [which results in **learning less**
about disaster than we could]{.underline} and in missing opportunities
to use disaster to learn about society (cf. Sorokin, 1942). **[We need
new conceptual tools]{.underline}** [because of an upward trend in
frequency and severity of disaster]{.underline} since 1970 (Perrow,
2007), and because of a growing intellectual attention to the idea of
worst cases (Clarke, 2006b; Clarke, in press). For instance, the chief
scientist in charge of studying earthquakes for the US Geological
Service, Lucile Jones, has worked on the combination of events that
could happen in California that would constitute a \"give up scenario\":
a very long-shaking earthquake in southern California just when the
Santa Anna winds are making everything dry and likely to burn. In such
conditions, meaningful response to the fires would be impossible and
recovery would take an extraordinarily long time. There are other
similar pockets of scholarly interest in extreme events, some spurred by
September 11 and many catalyzed by Katrina. The
[consequences]{.underline} of disasters [are also becoming more
severe]{.underline}, both in terms of lives lost and property damaged.
[People]{.underline} and their places [are becoming more vulnerable. The
most important reason]{.underline} that vulnerabilities are increasing
[is population concentration]{.underline} (Clarke, 2006b). This is a
general phenomenon and includes, for example, flying in jumbo jets,
working in tall buildings, and attending events in large capacity sports
arenas. [Considering]{.underline} disasters whose origin is [a natural
hazard, the]{.underline} specific [cause]{.underline} of increased
vulnerability [is]{.underline} that [people]{.underline} are
[moving]{.underline} [to where hazards originate]{.underline}, and most
especially to where the water is. In some places, this makes them
vulnerable to hurricanes that can create devastating storm surges; in
others it makes them vulnerable to earthquakes that can create tsunamis.
[In any case, the general problem is that people concentrate themselves
in dangerous places, so when the hazard comes disasters are
intensified.]{.underline} More than one-half of Florida\'s population
lives within 20 miles of the sea. Additionally, Florida\'s population
grows every year, along with increasing development along the coasts.
The risk of exposure to a devastating hurricane is obviously high in
Florida. No one should be surprised if during the next hurricane season
Florida becomes the scene of great tragedy. The [demographic pressures
and attendant development are wide- spread. People are concentrating
along]{.underline} the [coasts]{.underline} of the United States,
[and]{.underline}, like Florida, [this puts people at risk]{.underline}
of water-related hazards. Or consider the Pacific Rim, the coastline
down the west coasts of North and South America, south to Oceania, and
then up the eastern coast- line of Asia. There the hazards are
particularly threatening. Maps of population concentration around the
Pacific Rim should be seen as target maps, because along those
shorelines are some of the most active tectonic plates in the world. The
2004 Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, which killed at least 250,000
people, demonstrated the kind of damage that issues from the movement of
tectonic plates. (Few in the United States recognize that there is a
subduction zone just off the coast of Oregon and Washington that is
quite similar to the one in Indonesia.) Additionally, volcanoes reside
atop the meeting of tectonic plates; the typhoons that originate in the
Pacific Ocean generate furiously fatal winds. [Perrow]{.underline}
(2007) [has generalized]{.underline} the point about [concentration,
arguing]{.underline} not only that [we increase vulnerabilities by
increasing the breadth and depth of exposure to hazards but also by
concentrating industrial facilities with catastrophic
potentia]{.underline}l. Some of Perrow\'s most important [examples
concern chemical production]{.underline} facilities. These are
facilities that bring together in a single place multiple stages of
production used in the production of toxic substances. Key to Perrow\'s
argument is that there is no technically necessary reason for such
concentration, although there may be good economic reasons for it. [The
general point is that we can expect more disasters,]{.underline} whether
their origins are [\"natural\" or \"technological.\"]{.underline} We can
also expect [more death and destruction]{.underline} from them. [I
predict **[we will]{.mark} continue to [be poorly prepared to deal with
disaster]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [People]{.underline} around the world
[were appalled with the incompetence of]{.underline} America\'s
[leaders]{.underline} and orga[-]{.underline} nizations [in]{.underline}
the wake of Hurricanes [Katrina]{.underline} and Rita. Day after day we
watched people suffering unnecessarily. Leaders were slow to grasp the
importance of the event. With a few notable exceptions, organi- zations
lumbered to a late rescue. Setting aside our moral reaction to the
official neglect, perhaps [we ought to ask why **we should have expected
a competent response** at all]{.underline}? Are US leaders and organiza-
tions particularly attuned to the suffering of people in disasters? Is
the political economy of the United States organized so that people,
espe- cially poor people, are attended to quickly and effectively in
noncri- sis situations? The answers to these questions are obvious. If
social systems are not arranged to ensure people\'s well-being in normal
times, there is no good reason to expect them to be so inclined in
disastrous times. Still, [if we are **ever** going to be reasonably well
prepared to avoid or respond to the next Katrina-like event, **we need
to identify the barriers** to effective thinking about,]{.underline} and
effective response to, [disas- ters]{.underline}. [**One of those
barriers** is that we do not have a set of concepts that would help us
think rigorously about out-sized events. The **chief toolkit** of
concepts that we have]{.underline} for thinking about important social
events [comes from [probability theory]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are
good reasons for this, as probability theory has obviously served social
research well. Still, [the toolkit [is
**incomplete**]{.mark}]{.underline} when it comes to extreme events,
[[especially when]{.mark} it is [used]{.mark} as a base whence
[to]{.mark} [make]{.mark} normative [judgments about
what]{.mark}]{.underline} people, organizations, and [[governments
should]{.mark}]{.underline} and should not [[do]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[As a complement to probabilistic thinking I propose that we need
possibilistic thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In this paper I explicate
the notion of possibilistic thinking. I first discuss the equation of
probabilism with rationality in scholarly thought, followed by a section
that shows the ubiquity of possibilis- tic thinking in everyday life.
Demonstrating the latter will provide an opportunity to explore the
limits of the probabilistic approach: that [possibilistic
thinking]{.underline} is widespread suggests it [could be used more
rigorously]{.underline} in social research. I will then address the most
vexing prob- lem with advancing and employing possibilistic thinking:
the prob- lem of infinite imagination. I argue that [possibilism can be
used [with discipline]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[we **can
be smarter** about responding]{.mark}]{.underline} to disasters [by
doing so]{.underline}.

**Extinction first**

1.2. THE ETHICS OF EXISTENTIAL RISK In his book Reasons and Persons,
Oxford philosopher Derek Parfit advanced an influential argument about
the importance of avoiding extinction: I believe that if we destroy
mankind, as we now can, this outcome will be much worse than most people
think. [[Compare]{.mark} three outcomes: (1) [Peace]{.mark}. (2) A
nuclear [war that kills 99%]{.mark} of the world's existing population.
(3) A nuclear [war that kills 100%]{.mark}.]{.underline} (2) would be
worse than (1), and (3) would be worse than (2). Which is the greater of
these two differences? [Most people believe that the greater difference
is between (1) and (2).]{.underline} [I believe that [the difference
between (2) and (3) is]{.mark} very [much greater]{.mark}]{.underline}.
\... [The Earth will remain habitable for **at least another billion
years**.]{.underline} [Civilization began only a few thousand years
ago.]{.underline} [[If we do not destroy mankind, these]{.mark} few
thousand [years may be]{.mark} only [**a tiny fraction** of the whole of
civilized]{.mark} human [history]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The difference
between (2) and (3) may thus be the difference between this tiny
fraction and all of the rest of this history.]{.underline} [If we
compare this possible history to a day, what has occurred so far is only
a **fraction of a second**.65]{.underline} In this argument, it seems
that Parfit is assuming that the survivors of a nuclear war that kills
99% of the population would eventually be able to recover civilisation
without long-term effect. As we have seen, this may not be a safe
assumption -- but for the purposes of this thought experiment, the point
stands. [What makes [existential catastrophes]{.mark} especially bad is
that they [would "**destroy the future**,"]{.mark} as]{.underline}
another Oxford philosopher, Nick [Bostrom, puts it.]{.underline}66
[[This future could]{.mark} potentially [be]{.mark} extremely
[long]{.mark} and full of [flourishing, and]{.mark} would therefore
[have]{.mark} extremely [large value]{.mark}.]{.underline} In standard
risk analysis, when working out how to respond to risk, we work out the
expected value of risk reduction, by weighing the probability that an
action will prevent an adverse event against the severity of the event.
[Because the value of preventing existential catastrophe is so vast,
even a tiny probability of prevention has huge expected
value.]{.underline}67 Of course, there is persisting reasonable
disagreement about ethics and there are a number of ways one might
resist this conclusion.68 Therefore, it would be unjustified to be
overconfident in Parfit and Bostrom's argument. [In some areas,
government policy does give significant weight to future
generations.]{.underline} For example, in assessing the risks of nuclear
waste storage, governments have considered timeframes of thousands,
hundreds of thousands, and even a million years.69 Justifications for
this policy usually appeal to principles of intergenerational equity
according to which future generations ought to get as much protection as
current generations.70 Similarly, widely accepted norms of sustainable
development require development that meets the needs of the current
generation without compromising the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs.71 [However, when it comes to existential risk, it
would seem that we fail to live up to principles of intergenerational
equity.]{.underline} [Existential catastrophe would not only give future
generations less than the current generations; **it would give them
nothing**.]{.underline} Indeed, [reducing existential risk plausibly has
a quite low cost for us in comparison with the huge expected value it
has for future generations.]{.underline} In spite of this, relatively
little is done to reduce existential risk. [Unless we give up on norms
of intergenerational equity, they give us a strong case for
significantly increasing our efforts to reduce existential
risks.]{.underline} 1.3. WHY EXISTENTIAL RISKS MAY BE SYSTEMATICALLY
UNDERINVESTED IN, AND THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY [In spite
of the importance of [existential risk]{.mark} reduction, it probably
[receives less attention than]{.mark} is
[warranted]{.mark}.]{.underline} As a result, concerted international
cooperation is required if we are to receive adequate protection from
existential risks. 1.3.1. Why existential risks are likely to be
underinvested in [There are several reasons why existential risk
reduction is likely to be underinvested in.]{.underline} [Firstly, [it
is a global public]{.mark} good.]{.underline} [Economic theory predicts
that such goods tend to be underprovided.]{.underline} [The benefits of
existential risk reduction are widely and indivisibly dispersed around
the globe from the countries responsible for taking action.]{.underline}
Consequently, a country which reduces existential risk gains only a
small portion of the benefits but bears the full brunt of the costs.
Countries thus have strong incentives to free ride, receiving the
benefits of risk reduction without contributing. As a result, too few do
what is in the common interest. [Secondly]{.underline}, as already
suggested above, [existential risk reduction is an
[intergenerational]{.mark} public [good]{.mark}: most of the benefits
are enjoyed by future generations who have no say in the political
process.]{.underline} [For these goods, the problem is temporal free
riding: the current generation enjoys the benefits of inaction while
future generations bear the costs. Thirdly]{.underline}, many
[existential risks]{.underline}, such as machine superintelligence,
engineered pandemics, and solar geoengineering, [pose an unprecedented
and uncertain future threat.]{.underline} Consequently, it is hard to
develop a satisfactory governance regime for them: there are few
existing governance instruments which can be applied to these risks, and
it is unclear what shape new instruments should take. In this way, our
position with regard to these emerging risks is comparable to the one we
faced when nuclear weapons first became available. [[Cognitive
biases]{.mark} also [lead people to underestimate]{.mark} existential
[risks]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Since [there have not been any
catastrophes of this magnitude]{.mark}, these risks are not salient to
politicians and the public.]{.underline}72 This is an example of the
misapplication of the availability heuristic, a mental shortcut which
assumes that something is important only if it can be readily recalled.
[[Another]{.mark} cognitive bias affecting perceptions of existential
risk [is scope neglect]{.mark}.]{.underline} In a seminal 1992 study,
three groups were asked how much they would be willing to pay to save
2,000, 20,000 or 200,000 birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The
groups answered \$80, \$78, and \$88, respectively.73 In this case, the
size of the benefits had little effect on the scale of the preferred
response. [People become numbed to the effect of saving lives when the
numbers get too large.]{.underline} 74 [Scope neglect is a particularly
acute problem for existential risk because the numbers at stake are so
large.]{.underline} [Due to scope neglect, decision-makers are prone to
treat existential risks in a similar way to problems which are less
severe by many orders of magnitude.]{.underline} A wide range of other
cognitive biases are likely to affect the evaluation of existential
risks.75

2\. Risks with infinite impact: A new category of risks "Most risk
management is really just advanced contingency planning and disciplining
yourself to realise that, [given enough time, very **low probability
events not only can happen, but they absolutely will
happen**]{.underline}." Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs CEO, July 2013 1
[**[Risk = Probability × Impact]{.mark}** [Impacts where civilisation
collapses to]{.mark} a state of [**great suffering** and **do not
recover**]{.mark}, or a situation where all human life end, [are]{.mark}
defined as [**infinite** as the result is **irreversible**]{.mark} and
**lasts forever**]{.underline}. A new group of global risks This is a
report about [a limited number of global risks -- that can be identified
through a scientific and transparent process -- with impacts of a
magnitude that pose a threat to human civilisation, or even possibly to
all human life]{.underline}. With such a focus it may surprise some
readers to find that the report's essential aim is to inspire action and
dialogue as well as an increased use of the methodologies used for risk
assessment. The real focus is not on the almost unimaginable impacts of
the risks the report outlines. Its fundamental purpose is to encourage
global collaboration and to use this new category of risk as a driver
for innovation. [The idea that we face a number of global challenges
threatening the very basis of our civilisation at the beginning of the
21st century is well accepted in the scientific community]{.underline},
and is studied at a number of leading universities.2 But there is still
no coordinated approach to address this group of challenges and turn
them into opportunities for a new generation of global cooperation and
the creation of a global governance system capable of addressing the
greatest challenges of our time. [This]{.underline} report has, to the
best of our knowledge, [created the first science-based list of global
risks with a potentially infinite impact]{.underline} and has made the
first attempt to provide an initial overview of the uncertainties
related to these risks as well as rough quantifications for the
probabilities of these impacts. What is risk? Risk is the potential of
losing something of value, weighed against the potential to gain
something of value. Every day we make different kinds of risk
assessments, in more or less rational ways, when we weigh different
options against each other. The basic idea of risk is that an
[uncertainty exists regarding the outcome and that we must find a way to
take the best possible decision based on our understanding of this
uncertainty]{.underline}.3 To calculate risk the probability of an
outcome is often multiplied by the impact. The impact is in most cases
measured in economic terms, but it can also be measured in anything we
want to avoid, such as suffering. At the heart of a risk assessment is a
probability distribution, often described by a probability density
function4; see figure X for a graphic illustration. The slightly tilted
bell curve is a common probability distribution, but the shape differs
and in reality is seldom as smooth as the example. The total area under
the curve always represents 100 percent, i.e. all the possible outcomes
fit under the curve. In this case (A) represents the most probable
impact. With a much lower probability it will be a close to zero impact,
illustrated by (B). In the same way as in case B there is also a low
probability that the situation will be very significant, illustrated by
(C). Figure 1: Probability density function \[FIGURE 1 OMITTED\] [The
impacts (A), (B) and (C) all belong to the same category,]{.underline}
~~normal~~ [\[common\] impacts: the impacts may be more or less serious,
but they can be dealt with within the current system]{.underline}. [The
impacts in this report are however of a special kind. These are impacts
where everything will be lost and the situation will not be reversible,
i.e challenges with potentially infinite impact]{.underline}. In
insurance and finance this kind of risk is called "risk of ruin", an
impact where all capital is lost.5 This impact is however only infinite
for the company that is losing the money. From society's perspective,
that is not a special category of risk. In this report the focus is on
the "risk of ruin" on a global scale and on a human level, [in the worst
case this is when we risk the extinction of our own
species]{.underline}. [On a probability curve the impacts in this report
are usually at the very far right with a relatively low probability
compared with other impacts]{.underline}, illustrated by (D) in Figure
2. Often they are so far out on the tail of the curve that they are not
even included in studies. [For each risk in this report the probability
of an infinite impact is very low compared to the most likely
outcome]{.underline}. Some studies even indicate that not all risks in
this report can result in an infinite impact. [But a significant number
of [**peer-reviewed** reports indicate]{.mark} that [those]{.mark}
impacts **not only [can happen]{.mark}**, but that [their **probability
is increasing** due to **unsustainable trends**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The assumption for this report is that by creating a better
understanding of our scientific knowledge regarding risks with a
potentially infinite impact, we can inspire initiatives that can turn
these risks into drivers for innovation. [Not only could a better
understanding of the unique magnitude of these risks help address the
risks we face, it could also help to create a path towards more
sustainable development]{.underline}. The group of global risks
discussed in this report are so different from most of the challenges we
face that they are hard to comprehend. But that is also why they can
help us to build the collaboration we need and drive the development of
further solutions that benefit both people and the planet. As noted
above, none of the risks in this report is likely to result directly in
an infinite impact, and some are probably even physically incapable of
doing so. But all are so significant that they could reach a threshold
impact able to create social and ecological instability that could
trigger a process which could lead to an infinite impact. For several
reasons the potentially infinite impacts of the risks in this report are
not as well known as they should be. One reason is [the way that extreme
impacts are often masked by most of the theories and models used by
governments and business today]{.underline}. For example, the
probability of extreme impacts is often below what is included in
studies and strategies. [The [tendency to exclude impacts below a
probability of five percent is]{.mark} one [reason for the]{.mark}
**relative ["invisibility"]{.mark}** [of **infinite impacts**]{.mark}.
The almost standard use of a 95% confidence interval is one reason why
low-probability high-impact events are often ignored]{.underline}.6
Figure 2: Probability density function with tail highlighted \[FIGURE 2
OMITTED\] Climate change is a good example, where almost all of the
focus is on the most likely scenarios and there are few studies that
include the low-probability high-impact scenarios. In most reports about
climate impacts, the impacts caused by warming beyond five or six
degrees Celsius are even omitted from tables and graphs even though the
IPCC's own research indicates that the probability of these impacts are
often between one and five percent, and sometimes even higher.7 Other
aspects that contribute to this relative invisibility include the fact
that extreme impacts are difficult to translate into monetary terms,
they have a global scope, and they often require a time-horizon of a
century or more. They cannot be understood simply by linear
extrapolation of current trends, and they lack historical precedents.
There is also the fact that the measures required to significantly
reduce the probability of infinite impacts will be radical compared to a
business-as-usual scenario with a focus on incremental changes. The
exact probability of a specific impact is difficult or impossible to
estimate.8 However, the important thing is to establish the current
magnitude of the probabilities and compare them with the probabilities
for such impacts we cannot accept. [A failure to provide any estimate
for these risks often results in strategies and priorities defined as
though the probability of a totally unacceptable outcome is
zero]{.underline}. An approximate number for a best estimate also makes
it easier to understand that a great uncertainty means the actual
probability can be both much higher and much lower than the best
estimate. It should also be stressed that [uncertainty is not a weakness
in science; it always exists in scientific work. It is a systematic way
of understanding the limitations of the methodology, data,
etc]{.underline}.9 [Uncertainty is not a reason to wait to take action
if the impacts are serious]{.underline}. Increased uncertainty is
something that risk experts, e.g. insurance experts and security policy
experts, interpret as a signal for action. [A contrasting challenge is
that our [cultural references to]{.mark} the threat of [infinite impacts
have been dominated]{.mark} throughout history [by]{.mark} religious
[groups seeking to scare society without]{.mark} any [scientific
backing]{.mark}, often as a way [to **discipline people**]{.mark} and
implement unpopular measures. It should not have to be said, but
[this]{.mark} report [is]{.mark} obviously [**fundamentally different**
as it focuses on **scientific evidence** from **peer-reviewed
sources**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Infinite impact The concept infinite
impact refers to two aspects in particular; the terminology is not meant
to imply a literally infinite impact (with all the mathematical
subtleties that would imply) but to serve as a reminder that these risks
are of a different nature. Ethical [These are [impacts]{.mark} that
[threaten the]{.mark} very **[survival of humanity and life on
Earth]{.mark}** -- and therefore can be seen as being infinitely
negative [from an **ethical perspective**]{.mark}. **[No positive gain
can outweigh even a small probability]{.mark}** for an infinite negative
impact. Such risks require society to ensure that we eliminate these
risks by reducing the impact below an infinite impact as a **top
priority**, or at least do everything we can to reduce the probability
of these risks]{.underline}. As some of these risks are impossible to
eliminate today it is also important to discuss what probability can
right now be accepted for risks with a possible infinite impact.
Economic Infinite impacts are beyond what most traditional economic
models today are able to cope with. [The impacts are irreversible in the
most fundamental way, so tools like cost-benefit assessment seldom make
sense]{.underline}. To use discounting that makes infinite impacts
(which could take place 100 years or more from now and affect all future
generations) close to invisible in economic assessments, is another
example of a challenge with current tools. So while tools like
cost-benefit models and discounting can help us in some areas, they are
seldom applicable in the context of infinite impacts. New tools are
needed to guide the global economy in an age of potential infinite
impacts. See chapter 2.2.2 for a more detailed iscussion. Roulette and
Russian roulette When probability and normal risks are discussed the
example of a casino and roulette is often used. You bet something, then
spin the wheel and with a certain probability you win or lose. You can
use different odds to discuss different kinds of risk taking. These
kinds of thought experiment can be very useful, but when it comes to
infinite risks these gaming analogies become problematic. For infinite
impact a more appropriate analogy is probably Russian roulette. But
instead of "normal" Russian roulette where you only bet your own life
you are now also betting everyone you know and everyone you don't know.
Everyone alive will die if you lose. There will be no second chance for
anyone as there will be no future generations; humanity will end with
your loss. What probability would you accept for different sums of money
if you played this version of Russian roulette? Most people would say
that it is stupid and -- no matter how low the probability is and no
matter how big the potential win is -- this kind of game should not be
played, as it is unethical. Many would also say that no person should be
allowed to make such a judgment, as those who are affected do not have a
say. You could add that most of those who will lose from it cannot say
anything as they are not born and will never exist if you lose. The
difference between ordinary roulette and "allhumanity Russian roulette"
is one way of illustrating the difference in nature between a "normal"
risk that is reversible, and a risk with an infinite impact. [An
additional challenge in acknowledging the risks outlined in this report
is that [many]{.mark} of the [traditional risks including wars]{.mark}
and violence [have decreased]{.mark}, even though it might not always
looks that way in media]{.underline}.10 [So a significant number of
experts today spend a substantial amount of time trying to explain that
much of what is discussed as dangerous trends might not be as dangerous
as we think]{.underline}. For policy makers listening only to experts in
traditional risk areas [it is therefore easy to get the impression that
global risks are becoming less of a problem]{.underline}. [The **chain
of events** that could result in **infinite impacts** in this report
also **differ** from most of the traditional risks, as most of them are
**not** triggered by **wilful acts**, but
**accidents**/mistakes]{.underline}. Even the probabilities related to
nuclear war in this report are to a large degree related to inadvertent
escalation. As many of the tools to analyse and address risks have been
developed to protect nations and states from attacks, [risks involving
accidents tend to get less attention]{.underline}. This report
emphasises the need for an open and democratic process in addressing
global challenges with potentially infinite impact. Hence, this is a
scientifically based invitation to discuss how we as a global community
can address what could be considered the greatest challenges of our
time. The difficulty for individual scientists to communicate a
scientific risk approach should however not be underestimated.
[Scientists who today talk about low-probability impacts, that are
serious but still far from infinite, are often accused of pessimism and
scaremongering, even if they do nothing but highlight scientific
findings]{.underline}.11 To highlight infinite impacts with even lower
probability can therefore be something that a scientist who cares about
his/her reputation would want to avoid. In the media it is still common
to contrast the most probable climate impact with the probability that
nothing, or almost nothing, will happen. The fact that almost nothing
could happen is not wrong in most cases, but it is unscientific and
dangerous if different levels of probability are presented as equal. The
tendency to compare the most probable climate impact with the
possibility of a low or no impact also [results in a situation where
low-probability high-impact outcomes are often totally ignored. An
honest and scientific approach is to, whenever possible, present the
whole probability distribution and pay special attention to unacceptable
outcomes]{.underline}. [The fact that we have challenges that with some
probability might be infinite and therefore fundamentally irreversible
is difficult to comprehend, and **[physiologically]{.mark}** they are
something our [brains are poorly equipped to respond]{.mark} to,
according to evolutionary psychologists]{.underline}.12 It is hard for
us as individuals to grasp that humanity for the first time in its
history now has the capacity to create such catastrophic outcomes.
Professor Marianne Frankenhaeuser, former head of the psychology
division, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, put it this way: "Part of the
answer is to be found in psychological defence mechanisms. The nuclear
threat is collectively denied, because to face it would force us to face
some aspects of the world's situation which we do not want to
recognise." 13 [This [**psychological** denial]{.mark} may be one reason
why there is a tendency among some stakeholders to confuse "being
optimistic" with denying what science is telling us, and [ignoring parts
of the probability curve]{.mark}]{.underline}.14 Ignoring the fact that
there is strong scientific evidence for serious impacts in different
areas, and focusing only on selected sources which suggest that the
problem may not be so serious, is not optimistic. It is both
unscientific and dangerous.15 [A scientific approach requires us to base
our decisions on the whole probability distribution]{.underline}.
Whether it is possible to address the challenge or not is the area where
optimism and pessimism can make people look at the same set of data and
come to different conclusions. Two things are important to keep in mind:
first, that there is always a probability distribution when it comes to
risk; second, that there are two different kinds of impacts that are of
interest for this report. The probability distribution can have
different shapes but in simplified cases the shape tends to look like a
slightly modified clock (remember figure 1). In the media it can sound
as though experts argue whether an impact, for example a climate impact
or a pandemic, will be dangerous or not. But what serious experts
discuss is the probability of different oucomes. They can disagree on
the shape of the curve or what curves should be studied, but not that a
probability curve exists. With climate change this includes discussions
about how sensitive the climate is, how much greenhouse gas will be
emitted, and what impacts that different warmings will result in. Just
as it is important not to ignore challenges with potentially infinite
impacts, it is also important not to use them to scare people. Dramatic
images and strong language are best avoided whenever possible, as this
group of risks require sophisticated strategies that benefit from
rational arguments. Throughout history we have seen too many examples
when threats of danger have been damagingly used to undermine important
values. The history of infinite impacts: The LA-602 document The
understanding of infinite impacts is very recent compared with most of
our institutions and laws. It is only 70 years ago that Edward Teller,
one of the greatest physicists of his time, with his
back-of-the-envelope calculations, produced results that differed
drastically from all that had gone before. His calculations indicated
that the explosion of a nuclear bomb -- a creation of some of the
brightest minds on the planet, including Teller himself -- could result
in a chain reaction so powerful that it would ignite the world's
atmosphere, thereby ending human life on Earth.16 Robert Oppenheimer,
who led the Manhattan Project to develop the nuclear bomb, halted the
project to see whether Teller's calculations were correct.17 The
resulting document, LA- 602: Ignition of the Atmosphere with Nuclear
Bombs, concluded that Teller was wrong, But the sheer complexity drove
them to end their assessment by writing that "further work on the
subject \[is\] highly desirable".18 The LA-602 document can be seen as
the first scientific global risk report addressing a category of risks
where the worst possible impact in all practical senses is infinite.19
Since the atomic bomb more challenges have emerged with potentially
infinite impact. Allmost all of these new challenges are linked to the
increased knowledge, economic and technical development that has brought
so many benefits. For example, climate change is the result of the
industrial revolution and development that was, and still is, based
heavily on fossil fuel. The increased potential for global pandemics is
the result of an integrated global economy where goods and services move
quickly around the world, combined with rapid urbanisation and high
population density. In parallel with the increased number of risks with
possible infinite impact, our capacity to analyse and solve them has
greatly increased too. Science and technology today provides us with
knowledge and tools that can radically reduce the risks that
historically have been behind major extinctions, such as pandemics and
asteroids. Recent challenges like climate change, and emerging
challenges like synthetic biology and nanotechnology, can to a large
degree be addressed by smart use of new technologies, new lifestyles and
institutional structures. It will be hard as it will require
collaboration of a kind that we have not seen before. It will also
require us to create systems that can deal with the problems before they
occur. The fact that the same knowledge and tools can be both a problem
and a solution is important to understand in order to avoid
polarisation. Within a few decades, or even sooner, many of the tools
that can help us solve the global challenges of today will come from
fields likely to provide us with the most powerful instruments we have
ever had -- resulting in their own sets of challenges. Synthetic
biology, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence (AI) are all rapidly
evolving fields with great potential. They may help solve many of
today's main challenges or, if not guided in a benign direction, may
result in catastrophic outcomes. The point of departure of this report
is the fact that we now have the knowledge, economic resources and
technological ability to reduce most of the greatest risks of our time.
Conversely, the infinite impacts we face are almost all unintended
results of human ingenuity. The reason we are in this situation is that
we have made progress in many areas without addressing unintended
low-probability high-impact consequences. Creating innovative and
resilient systems rather than simply managing risk would let us focus
more on opportunities. But the resilience needed require moving away
from legacy systems is likely to be disruptive, so an open and
transparent discussion is needed regarding the transformative solutions
required. Figure 3: Probability density function with tail and threshold
highlighted \[FIGURE 3 OMITTED\] 2.1 Report structure The first part of
the report is an introduction where the global risks with potential
infinite impact are introduced and defined. This part also includes the
methodology for selecting these risks, and presents the twelve risks
that meet this definition. Four goals of the report are also presented,
under the headings "acknowledge", "inspire", "connect" and "deliver".
The second part is an overview of the twelve global risks and key events
that illustrate some of the work around the world to address them. For
each challenge five important factors that influence the probability or
impact are also listed. The risks are divided into four different
categories depending on their characteristics. "Current challenges" is
the first category and includes the risks that currently threaten
humanity due to our economic and technological development - extreme
climate change, for example, which depends on how much greenhouse gas we
emit. "Exogenic challenges" includes risks where the basic probability
of an event is beyond human control, but where the probability and
magnitude of the impact can be influenced - asteroid impacts, for
example, where the asteroids' paths are beyond human control but an
impact can be moderated by either changing the direction of the asteroid
or preparing for an impact. "Emerging challenges" includes areas where
technological development and scientific assessment indicate that they
could both be a very important contribution to human welfare and help
reduce the risks associated with current challenges, but could also
result in new infinite impacts.20 AI, nanotechnology and synthetic
biology are examples. "Global policy challenge" is a different kind of
risk. It is a probable threat arising from future global governance as
it resorts to destructive policies, possibly in response to the other
challenges listed above. The third part of the report discusses the
relationship between the different risks. Action to reduce one risk can
increase another, unless their possible links are understood. Many
solutions are also able to address multiple risks, so there are
significant benefits from understanding how one relates to others.
Investigating these correlations could be a start, but correlation is a
linear measure and non-linear techniques may be more helpful for
assessing the aggregate risk. The fourth part is an overview, the first
ever to our knowledge, of the uncertainties and probabilities of global
risks with potentially infinite impacts. The numbers are only rough
estimates and are meant to be a first step in a dialogue where
methodologies are developed and estimates refined. The fifth part
presents some of the most important underlying trends that influence the
global challenges, which often build up slowly until they reach a
threshold and very rapid changes ensue. The sixth and final part
presents an overview of possible ways forward. 2.2 Goals Goal 1:
Acknowledge That key stakeholders, influencing global challenges,
acknowledge the existence of the category of risks that could result in
infinite impact. They should also recognice that the list of risks that
belong to this category should be revised as new technologies are
developed and our knowledge increases. Regardless of the risks included,
the category should be given special attention in all processes and
decisions of relevance. The report also seeks to demonstrate to all key
stakeholders that we have the capacity to reduce, or even eliminate,
most of the risks in this category. Establish a category of risks with
potentially infinite impact. Before anything significant can happen
regarding global risks with potentially infinite impacts, their
existence must be acknowledged. Rapid technological development and
economic growth have delivered unprecedented material welfare to
billions of people in a veritable tide of utopias.21 But we now face the
possibility that even tools created with the best of intentions can have
a darker side too, a side that may threaten human civilisation, and
conceivably the continuation of human life. This is what all
decision-makers need to recognise. Rather than succumbing to terror, we
need to acknowledge that we can let the prospect inspire and drive us
forward. Goal 2: Inspire That policy makers inspire action by explaining
how the probabilities and impacts can be reduced and turned into
opportunities. Concrete examples of initiatives should be communicated
in different networks in order to create ripple effects, with the
long-term goal that all key stakeholders should be inspired to turn
these risks into opportunities for positive action. Show concrete action
that is taking place today. This report seeks to show that it is not
only possible to contribute to reducing these risks, but that it is
perhaps the most important thing anyone can spend their time on. It does
so by combining information about the risks with information about
individuals and groups who has made a significant contribution by
turning challenges into opportunities. By highlighting concrete examples
the report hopes to inspire a new generation of leaders. Goal 3: Connect
That leaders in different sectors connect with each other to encourage
collaboration. A specific focus on financial and security policy where
significant risks combine to demand action beyond the incremental is
required. Support new meetings between interested stakeholders. The
nature of these risks spans countries and continents; they require
action by governments and politicians, but also by companies, academics,
NGOs, and many other groups. The magnitude of the possible impacts
requires not only leaders to act but above all new models for global
cooperation and decision-making to ensure delivery. The need for
political leadership is therefore crucial. Even with those risks where
many groups are involved, such as climate change and pandemics, very few
today address the possibility of infinite impact aspects. Even fewer
groups address the links between the different risks. There is also a
need to connect different levels of work, so that local, regional,
national and international efforts can support each other when it comes
to risks with potentially infinite impacts. Goal 4: Deliver That
concrete strategies are developed that allow key stakeholders to
identify, quantify and address global challenges as well as gather
support for concrete steps towards a wellfunctioning global governance
system. This would include tools and initiatives that can help identify,
quantify and reduce risks with potentially infinite impacts. Identify
and implement strategies and initiatives. Reports can acknowledge,
inspire and connect, but only people can deliver actual results. The
main focus of the report is to show that actual initiatives need to be
taken that deliver actual results. Only when the probability of an
infinite impact becomes acceptably low, very close to zero, and/or when
the maximum impact is significantly reduced, should we talk about real
progress. In order to deliver results it is important to remember that
global governance to tackle these risks is the way we organise society
in order to address our greatest challenges. It is not a question of
establishing a "world government", it is about the way we organise
ourselves on all levels, from the local to the global. The report is a
first step and should be seen as an invitation to all responsible
parties that can affect the probability and impact of risks with
potentially infinite impacts. But its success will ultimately be
measured only on how it contributes to concrete results. 2.3 Global
challenges and infinite impact This chapter first introduces the concept
of infinite impact. It then describes the methodology used to identify
challenges with an infinite impact. It then presents risks with
potentially infinite impact that the methodology results in. 2.3.1
Definition of infinite impact The specific criterion for including a
risk in this report is that well-sourced science shows the challenge can
have the following consequences: 22 1. Infinite impact: When
civilisation collapses to a state of great suffering and does not
recover, or a situation where all human life ends. The existence of such
threats is well attested by science.23 2. Infinite impact threshold --
an impact that can trigger a chain of events that could result first in
a civilisation collapse, and then later result in an infinite impact.
Such thresholds are especially important to recognise in a complex and
interconnected society where resilience is decreasing.24 A collapse of
civilisation is defined as a drastic decrease in human population size
and political/economic/social complexity, globally for an extended
time.25 The above definition means the list of challenges is not static.
When new challenges emerge, or current ones fade away, the list will
change. An additional criterion for including risks in this report is
"human influence". Only risks where humans can influence either the
probability, the impact, or both, are included. For most risks both
impact and probability can be affected, for example with nuclear war,
where the number/size of weapons influences the impact and tensions
between countries affects the probability. Other risks, such as a
supervolcano, are included as it is possible to affect the impact
through various mitigation methods, even if we currently cannot affect
the probability. Risks that are susceptible to human influence are
indirectly linked, because efforts to address one of them may increase
or decrease the likelihood of another. 2.3.2 Why use "infinite impact"
as a concept? The concept of infinity was chosen as it reflects many of
the challenges, especially in economic theory, to addressing these risks
as well as the need to question much of our current way of thinking. The
concept of a category of risks based on their extreme impact is meant to
provide a tool to distinguish one particular kind of risk from others.
The benefit of this new concept should be assessed based on two things.
First, does the category exist, and second, is the concept helpful in
addressing these risks? [The report has found ample evidence that there
are risks with an impact that can end human civilisation and even all
human life]{.underline}. The report further concludes that a new
category of risk is not only meaningful but also timely. We live in a
society where [global risks with potentially infinite impacts increase
in both number and probability according to multiple
studies]{.underline}. Looking ahead, many emerging technologies which
will certainly provide beneficial results, might also result in an
increased probability of infinite impacts.26 Over the last few years a
greater understanding of low probability or unknown probability events
has helped more people to understand the importance of looking beyond
the most probable scenarios. Concepts like "black swans" and "perfect
storms" are now part of mainstream policy and business language.27
Greater understanding of the technology and science of complex systems
has also resulted in a new understanding of potentially disruptive
events. Humans now have such an impact on the planet that the term "the
anthropocene" is being used, even by mainstream media like The
Economist.28 The term was introduced in the 90s by the Nobel Prize
winner Paul Crutzen to describe how humans are now the dominant force
changing the Earth's ecosystems.29 The idea to establish a well defined
category of risks that focus on risks with a potentially infinite impact
that can be used as a practical tool by policy makers is partly inspired
by Nick Bostrom's philosophical work and his introduction of a risk
taxonomy that includes an academic category called "existential
risks".30 Introducing a category with risks that have a potentially
infinite impact is not meant to be a mathematical definition; infinity
is a thorny mathematical concept and nothing in reality can be
infinite.31 It is meant to illustrate a singularity, when humanity is
threatened, when many of the tools used to approach most challenges
today become problematic, meaningless, or even counterproductive. The
concept of an infinite impact highlights a unique situation where
humanity itself is threatened and the very idea of value and price
collapses from a human perspective, as the price of the last humans also
can be seen to be infinite. This is not to say that those traditional
tools cannot still be useful, but with infinite impacts we need to add
an additional set of analytical tools. Life Value The following
estimates have been applied to the value of life in the US. The
estimates are either for one year of additional life or for the
statistical value of a single life. -- \$50,000 per year of quality life
(international standard most private and government-run health insurance
plans worldwide use to determine whether to cover a new medical
procedure) -- \$129,000 per year of quality life (based on analysis of
kidney dialysis procedures by Stefanos Zenios and colleagues at Stanford
Graduate School of Business) -- \$7.4 million (Environmental Protection
Agency) -- \$7.9 million (Food and Drug Administration) -- \$6 million
(Transportation Department) -- \$28 million (Richard Posner based on the
willingness to pay for avoiding a plane crash) Source: Wikipedia: Value

Posner, Richard A. Catastrophe: risk and response. Oxford University
Press, 2004 Some of the risks, including nuclear war, climate change and
pandemics, are often included in current risk overviews, but in many
cases their possible infinite impacts are excluded. The impacts which
are included are in most cases still very serious, but only the more
probable parts of the probability distributions are included, and the
last part of the long tail -- where the infinite impact is found -- is
excluded.32 Most risk reports do not differentiate between challenges
with a limited impact and those with a potential for infinite impact.
This is dangerous, as it can mean resources are spent in ways that
increase the probability of an infinite impact. Ethical aspects of
infinite impact [The basic ethical aspect of infinite impact is this: a
very small group alive today can take decisions that will fundamentally
affect all future generations]{.underline}. "All future generations" is
not a concept that is often discussed, and for good reason. All through
human history we have had no tools with a measurable global impact for
more than a few generations. [[Only in the last few decades has our
potential impact reached a level where all future generations can be
affected, for the simple reason that we now have the technological
capacity to end human civilisation.]{.underline}]{.mark} If we count
human history from the time when we began to practice settled
agriculture, that gives us about 12,000 years.33 If we make a moderate
assumption that humanity will live for at least 50 million more years34
[[our 12,000-year history]{.underline}]{.mark} so far
[[represents]{.underline}]{.mark} 1/4200, or [[0.024%, of our potential
histo]{.underline}]{.mark}ry. So [[our generation has the option of
risking everything]{.underline}]{.mark} and annulling 99.976% of our
potential history. [Comparing 0.024% with the days of a person living to
100 years from the day of conception, this would equal less than nine
days and is the first stage of human embryogenesis, the germinal
stage]{.underline}.35 Two additional arguments to treat potentially
infinite impacts as a separate category are: 36 1. [**[An
approach]{.mark} to infinite impacts [cannot be]{.mark} one of
[trial-and-error]{.mark}**, because there is no opportunity to learn
from errors. The reactive approach -- see what happens, limit damage,
and learn from experience -- is unworkable. [Instead]{.mark} society
[must]{.mark} be proactive. This requires foresight to foresee new types
of threat and willingness to [take]{.mark} decisive [preventative action
and]{.mark} to [bear the costs (**moral** and economic)]{.mark} of such
actions]{.underline}. 2. We cannot necessarily rely on the institutions,
morality, social attitudes or national security policies that developed
from our experience of other sorts of risk. Infinite impacts are in a
different category. [Institutions and individuals may find it hard to
take these [risks]{.mark} seriously simply because they [lie outside our
experience]{.mark}. Our [collective fear-response will]{.mark} probably
[be ill-calibrated]{.mark} to the magnitude of threat]{.underline}.
Economic aspects of infinite impact and discounting In today's society a
monetary value is sometimes ascribed to human life. Some experts use
this method to estimate risk by assigning a monetary value to human
extinction.37 We have to remember that the monetary values placed on a
human life in most cases are not meant to suggest that we have actually
assigned a specific value to a life. Assigning a value to a human life
is a tool used in a society with a limited supply of resources or
infrastructure (ambulances, perhaps) or skills. In such a society it is
impossible to save every life, so some trade-off must be made.38 The US
Environmental Protection Agency explains its use like this: "The EPA
does not place a dollar value on individual lives. Rather, when
conducting a benefit-cost analysis of new environmental policies, the
Agency uses estimates of how much people are willing to pay for small
reductions in their risks of dying from adverse health conditions that
may be caused by environmental pollution." 39 The fact that monetary
values for human lives can help to define priorities when it comes to
smaller risks does not mean that they are suitable for quite different
uses. Applying a monetary value to the whole human race makes little
sense to most people, and from an economic perspective it makes no
sense. Money helps us to prioritise, but with no humans there would be
no economy and no need for priorities. Ignoring, or discounting, future
generations is actually the only way to avoid astronomical numbers for
impacts that may seriously affect every generation to come. In
Catastrophe: Risk and Response, Richard Posner provides a cost estimate,
based on the assumption that a human life is worth \$50,000, resulting
in a \$300 tn cost for the whole of humanity, assuming a population of
six billion. He then doubles the population number to include the value
of all future generations, ending up with \$600 tn, while acknowledging
that "without discounting, the present value of the benefits of
risk-avoidance measures would often approach infinity for the type of
catastrophic risk with which this book is concerned." 40 Discounting for
risks that include the possibility of an infinite impact differs from
risk discounting for less serious impacts. For example the Stern
Review41 prompted a discussion between its chief author, Nicholas Stern,
and William Nordhaus,42 each of whom argued for different discount
levels using different arguments. But neither discussed a possible
infinite climate impact. An overview of the discussion by David Evans of
Oxford Brookes University highlighted some of the differing
assumptions.43 [Two things make infinite impacts special from a
discounting perspective. First, there is no way that future generations
can compensate for the impact, as they will not exist. Second, the
impact is something that is beyond an individual preference, as society
will no longer exist]{.underline}. Discounting is undertaken to allocate
resources in the most productive way. In cases that do not include
infinite impacts, discounting "reflects the fact that there are many
high-yield investments that would improve the quality of life for future
generations. The discount rate should be set so that our investable
funds are devoted to the most productive uses." 44 When there is a
potentially infinite impact, the focus is no longer on what investments
have the best rate of return, it is about avoiding the ultimate end.
While many economists shy away from infinite impacts, those exploring
the potentially extreme impacts of global challenges often assume
infinite numbers to make their point. Nordhaus for example writes that
"the sum of undiscounted anxieties would be infinite (i.e. equal to 1 +
1 +1 + ... = ∞). In this situation, most of us would dissolve in a sea
of anxiety about all the things that could go wrong for distant
generations from asteroids, wars, out-of-control robots, fat tails,
smart dust and other disasters." 45 It is interesting that Nordhaus
himself provides very good graphs that show why the most important
factor when determining actions is a possible threshold (see below
Figure 4 and 5). Nordhaus was discussing climate change, but the role of
thresholds is similar for most infinite impacts. The first figure is
based on traditional economic approaches which assume that Nature has no
thresholds; the second graph illustrates what happens with the curve
when a threshold exists. As Nordhaus also notes, it is hard to establish
thresholds, but if they are significant all other assumptions become
secondary. The challenge that Nordhaus does not address, and which is
important especially with climate change, is that [[thresholds become
invisible]{.mark} in]{.underline} economic [calculations [if they occur
far in]{.mark}to [the future, even if]{.mark} it is **[current
actions]{.mark}** that [unbalance the system]{.mark} and eventually push
it over the threshold]{.underline}.46 Note that these dramatic
illustrations rest on assumptions that the thresholds are still
relatively benign, not moving us beyond tipping points which result in
an accelerated release of methane that could result in a temperature
increase of more than 8 °C, possibly producing infinite impacts.47
Calculating illustrative numbers By including the welfare of future
generations, something that is important when their very existence is
threatened, economic discounting becomes difficult. In this chapter,
some illustrative numbers are provided to indicate the order of
magnitude of the values that calculations provide when traditional
calculations also include future generations. These illustrative
calculations are only illustrative as the timespans that must be used
make all traditional assumptions questionable to say the least. Still,
as an indicator for why infinite impact might be a good approximation
they might help. As a species that can manipulate our environment it
could be argued that the time the human race will be around, if we do
not kill ourselves, can be estimated to be between 1-10 million years --
the typical time period for the biological evolution of a successful
species48 -- and one billion years, the inhabitable time of Earth.49
\[FIGURE 4 OMITTED\] \[FIGURE 5 OMITTED\] If we assume -- 50 million
years for the future of humanity as our reference, -- an average life
expectancy of 100 years50, and -- a global population of 6 billion
people51 -- all conservative estimate -- , we have half a million
generations ahead of us with a total of 3 quadrillion individuals.
Assuming a value of \$50,000 per life, the cost of losing them would
then be \$1.5 ×1020, or \$150 quintillion. This is a very low estimate,
and Posner suggests that maybe the cost of a life should be "written up
\$28 million" for catastrophic risks52. Posner's calculations where only
one future generation is included result in a cost of \$336 quadrillion.
If we include all future generations with the same value, \$28 million,
the result is a total cost of \$86 sextillion, or \$86 × 1021. This \$86
sextillion is obviously a very rough number (using one billion years
instead of 50 million would for example require us to multiply the
results by 20), but again it is the magnitude that is interesting. As a
reference there are about 1011 to 1012 stars in our galaxy, and perhaps
something like the same number of galaxies. With this simple calculation
you get 1022 to 1024, or 10 to 1,000 sextillion, stars in the universe
to put the cost of infinite impacts when including future generations in
perspective.53 These numbers can be multiplied many times if a more
philosophical and technology-optimistic scenario is assumed for how many
lives we should include in future generations. The following quote is
from an article by Nick Bostrom in Global Policy Journal: "However, the
relevant figure is not how many people could live on Earth but how many
descendants we could have in total. One lower bound of the number of
biological human life-years in the future accessible universe (based on
current cosmological estimates) is 1034 years. Another estimate, which
assumes that future minds will be mainly implemented in computational
hardware instead of biological neuronal wetware, produces a lower bound
of 1054 human-brain-emulation subjective life-years." 54 Likewise the
value of a life, \$28 million, a value that is based on an assessment of
how individuals chose when it comes to flying, can be seen as much too
small. This value is based on how much we value our own lives on the
margin, and it is reasonable to assume that the value would be higher
than only a multiplication of our own value if we also considered the
risk of losing our family, everyone we know, as well as everyone else on
the planet. In the same way as the cost increases when a certain product
is in short supply, the cost of the last humans could be assumed to be
very high, if not infinite. Obviously, the very idea to put a price on
the survival of humanity can be questioned for good reasons, but if we
still want to use a number, \$28 million per life should at least be
considered as a significant underestimation. For those that are
reluctant or unable to use infinity in calculations and are in need of a
number for their formulas, \$86 sextillion could be a good initial start
for the cost of infinite impacts. But it is important to note that this
number might be orders of magnitude smaller than an estimate which
actually took into account a more correct estimation of the number of
people that should be included in future generations as well as the
price that should be assigned to the loss of the last humans. 2.3.3
Infinite impact threshold (IIT) As we address very complex systems, such
as human civilisation and global ecosystems, a concept as important as
infinite impact in this report is that of infinity impact threshold.
This is the impact level that can trigger a chain of events that results
in the end of human civilisation. The infinite impact threshold (IIT)
concept represents the idea that long before an actual infinite impact
is reached there is a tipping point where it (with some probability) is
no longer possible to reverse events. So instead of focusing only on the
ultimate impact it is important to estimate what level of impact the
infinity threshold entails. The IIT is defined as an impact that can
trigger a chain of events that could result first in a civilisation
collapse, and then later result in an infinite impact. Such thresholds
are especially important to recognise in a complex and interconnected
society where resilience is decreasing. Social and ecological systems
are complex, and in most complex systems there are thresholds where
positive feedback loops become self-reinforcing. In a system where
resilience is too low, feedback loops can result in a total system
collapse. These thresholds are very difficult to estimate and in most
cases it is possible only to estimate their order of magnitude. As David
Orrell and Patrick McSharry wrote in A Systems Approach to Forecasting:
"Complex systems have emergent properties, qualities that cannot be
predicted in advance from knowledge of systems components alone".
According to complexity scientist Stephen Wolfram's principle of
computational irreducibility, the only way to predict the evolution of
such a system is to run the system itself: "There is no simple set of
equations that can look into its future." 55 Orrell and McSharry also
noted that "in orthodox economics, the reductionist approach means that
the economy is seen as consisting of individual, independent agents who
act to maximise their own utility. It assumes that prices are driven to
a state of near-equilibrium by the 'invisible hand' of the economy.
Deviations from this state are assumed to be random and independent, so
the price fluctuations are often modelled using the normal distribution
or other distributions with thin tails and finite variance." The
drawbacks of an approach using the normal distribution, or other
distributions with thin tails and finite variance, become obvious when
the unexpected happens as in the recent credit crunch, when existing
models totally failed to capture the true risks of the economy. As an
employee of Lehman Brothers put it on August 11, 2007: "Events that
models predicted would happen only once in 10,000 years happened every
day for three days." 56 \[FIGURE 6 OMITTED\] The exact level for an
infinite impact threshold should not be the focus, but rather the fact
that such thresholds exists and that an order of magnitude should be
estimated.57 During the process of writing the report, experts suggested
that a relatively quick death of two billion people could be used as a
tentative number until more research is available.58 With current trends
undermining ecological and social resilience it should be noted that the
threshold level is likely to become lower as time progress. 2.3.4 Global
F-N curves and ALARP In the context of global risks with potentially
infinite impact, the possibility of establishing global F-N curves is
worth exploring. One of the most common and flexible frameworks used for
risk criteria divides risks into three bands: 59 1. Upper: an
unacceptable/ intolerable region, where risks are intolerable except in
extraordinary circumstances and risk reduction measures are essential.
2. Middle: an ALARP ("as low as reasonably practicable") region, where
risk reduction measures are desirable but may not be implemented if
their cost is disproportionate to the benefit achieved. 3. Lower: a
broadly acceptable/ negligible region, where no further risk reduction
measures are needed. The bands are expressed by F-N curves. When the
frequency of events which cause at least N fatalities is plotted against
the number N on log--log scales, the result is called an F-N curve.60 If
the frequency scale is replaced by annual probability, then the
resultant curve is called an f-N curve. The concept for the middle band
when using F-N curves is ALARP. It is a term often used in the area of
safety-critical and safety-involved systems.62 The ALARP principle is
that the residual risk should be as low as reasonably practicable. The
upper band, the unacceptable/ intolerable region, is usually the area
above the ALARP area (see figure 8) By using F-N curves it is also
possible to establish absolute impact levels that are never acceptable,
regardless of probability (Figure 7. Based on an actual F-n Curve
showing an absolute impact level that is defined as unacceptable). This
has been done in some cases for local projects. The infinite threshold
could be used to create an impact limit on global F-N curves used for
global challenges in the future. Such an approach would help
governments, companies and researchers when they develop new technical
solutions and when investing in resilience. Instead of reducing risk,
such an approach encourages the building of systems which cannot have
negative impacts above a certain level. Pros -- Clearly shows
relationship between frequency and size of accident -- Allows judgement
on relative importance of different sizes of accident -- Slope steeper
than -1 provides explicit consideration of multiple fatality aversion
and favours concepts with lower potential for large fatality events --
Allows company to manage overall risk exposure from portfolio of all
existing and future facilities Cons -- Cumulative expression makes it
difficult to interpret, especially by non-risk specialists -- Can be
awkard to derive -- May be difficult to use if criterion is exceeded in
one area but otherwise is well below -- Much debate about criterion

methodology exists that provides a constantly updated list of risks that
threaten human civilisation, or even all human life. Given that such a
category can help society to better understand and act to avoid such
risks, and better understand the relation between these risks, it can be
argued that a name for this category would be helpful.65 To name
something that refers to the end of humanity is in itself a challenge,
as the very idea is so far from our usual references and to many the
intuitive feeling will be to dismiss any such thing. The concept used in
this report is "infinity". The reson for this is that many of the
challenges relate to discussed. In one way the name is not very
important so long as people understand the impacts and risks associated
with it. Still, a name is symbolic and can either help or make it more
difficult to get support to establish the new category. The work to
establish a list of risks with infinite impact evolved from "existential
risk", the philosophical concept that inspired much of the work to
establish a clearly defined group of risks. The reason for not using the
concept "existential risk and impact" for this category, beside the fact
that existential impact is also used in academic contexts to refer to a
personal impact, is that the infinite category is a smaller subset of
"existential risk" and this new category is meant to be used as a tool,
not a scientific concept. Not only should the impacts in the category
potentially result in the end of all human life, it should be possible
to affect the probability and/or impact of that risk. There must also
exist an agreed methodology, such as the one suggested in this report,
that decides what risks belong and not belong on the list. Another
concept that the category relates to is "global catastrophic risk" as it
is one of the most used concepts among academics interested in infinite
impacts. However it is vague enough to be used to refer to impacts from
a few thousand deaths to the end of human civilisation. Already in use
but not clearly defined, it includes both the academic concept
existential risks and the category of risks with infinite impacts.
macroeconomics and its challenges in relation to the kind of impacts
that the risks in this report focus on. Further, the name clearly
highlights the unique nature without any normative judgements. Still,
infinity is an abstract concept and it might not be best communicate the
unique group of risks that it covers to all stakeholders. In the same
way as it can be hard to use singularity to describe a black hole, it
can be difficult to use infinity to describe a certain risk. If people
can accept that it is only from a specific perspective that the infinity
concept is relevant it could be used beyond the areas of macroeconomics.
Two other concepts that also have been considered during the process of
writing this report are "xrisks" and "human risk of ruin". Xrisk has the
advantage, and disadvantage, of not really saying anything at all about
the risk. The positive aspect is that the name can be associated with
the general concept of extinction and the philosophical concept of
existential risk as both have the letter x in them. The disadvantage is
the x often represents the unknown and can therefore relate to any risk.
There is nothing in the name that directly relates to the kind of
impacts that the category covers, so it is easy to interpret the term as
just unknown risks. Human risk of ruin has the advantage of having a
direct link to a concept, risk of ruin, that relates to a very specific
state where all is lost. Risk of ruin is a concept in use in gambling,
insurance, and finance that can all give very important contributions to
the work with this new category of risk. The resemblance to an existing
concept that is well established could be both a strength and a
liability. Below is an overview of the process when different names were

Global Challenges -- Twelve risks that threaten human civilisation --
The case for a new category of risks 47 2.3 Global challenges and
infinite impact 3. 2. 1. 9. Unacceptable risks in different
combinations, e.g. unacceptable global risks -- This is probably not
appropriate for two main reasons. First, it is a normative statement and
the category aims to be scientific; whether these risks are unacceptable
or not is up to the citizens of the world to decide. Second, the idea of
risk is that it is a combination of probability times impact. If a risk
is unacceptable is therefore also usually related to how easy it is to
avoid. Even if a risk is small, due to relatively low probability and
relatively low impact, but is very easy to address, it can be seen as
unacceptable, in the same way a large risk can be seen as acceptable if
it would require significant resources to reduce. There will not be a
perfect concept and the question is what concept can find the best
balance between being easy to understand, acceptable where policy
decisions needs to be made and also acceptable for all key groups that
are relevant for work in these area. During the process to find a name
for this category inspiration has been found in the process when new
concepts have been introduced; from irrational numbers and genocide to
sustainable development and the Human Development Index. So far
"infinite risk" can be seen as the least bad concept in some areas and
"xrisks" and "human risk of ruin" the least bad in others. The purpose
of this report is to establish a methodology to identify a very specific
group of risks as well as continue to a process where these risks will
be addressed in a systematic and appropriate way. The issue of naming
this group of risks will be left to others. The important is that the
category gets the attention it deserves. The three concepts are very
different. Global catastrophic risk is possibly the most used concept in
contexts where infinite impacts are included, but it is without any
clear definition. Existential risk is an academic concept used by a much
smaller group and with particular focus on future technologies. The
category in this report is a tool to help decision makers develop
strategies that help reduce the probability that humanity will end when
it can be avoided. The relation between the three concepts can be
illustrated with three circles. The large circle (1) represents global
catastrophic risks, the middle one (2) existential risks and the small
circle (3) the list of twelve risks in this report, i.e. risks where
there are peer reviewed academic studies that estimate the probability
of an infinite impact and where there are known ways to reduce the risk.
A list that could be called infinite risks, xrisks, or human risk of
ruin. Other concepts that are related to infinite impacts that could
potentially be used to describe the same category if the above
suggestions are not seen as acceptable concepts are presented below,
together with the main reason why these concepts were not chosen for
this report. 1. Risk of ruin -- is a concept in gambling, insurance and
finance relating to the likelihood of losing all one's capital or
affecting one's bankroll beyond the point of recovery. It is used to
describe individual companies rather than systems.66 2. Extinction risk
-- is used in biology for any species that is threatened. The concept is
also used in memory/cognition research. It is a very dramatic term, to
be used with care. These factors make it probably unsuitable for use by
stakeholders accustomed to traditional risk assessment. 3. Astronomical
risk -- is seldom used scientifically, but when it is used it is often
used for asteroids and is probably best reserved for them.67 4.
Apocalyptic risk -- could have been suitable, as the original meaning is
apocálypsis, from the Greek ἀπό and καλύπτω meaning 'un-covering'. It is
sometime used, but in a more general sense, to mean significant risks.68
But through history and today it is mainly used for a religious end of
time scenario. Its strong links to unscientific doom-mongers make it
probably unsuitable for a scientific concept. 5. End-of-the-world risk -
belongs to the irrational doomsday narratives and so is probably
unsuitable for scientific risk assessments. 6. Extreme risk -- is vague
enough to describe anything beyond the normal, so it is probably
unsuitable for risk assessments of this magnitude. 7. Unique risk -- is
even vaguer, as every risk is unique in some way. Probably best avoided
in risk assessments. 8. Collapse risk -- is based on Jared Diamond's
thinking.69 There are many different kinds of collapse and only a few
result in infinite impact. 48 Global Challenges -- Twelve risks that

Methodology 70 Global Challenges -- Twelve risks that threaten human
civilisation -- The case for a new category of risks 49 2.4 Methodology
The scientific review of literature was led by Seth Baum, Executive
Director of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute72 and research
scientist at the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions,
Columbia University.73 The methodology for including global risks with a
potentially infinite impact is based on a scientific review of key
literature, with focus on peer-reviewed academic journals, using keyword
search of both World of Knowledge74 and Google Scholar75 combined with
existing literature overviews in the area of global challenges. This
also included a snowball methodology where references in the leading
studies and books were used to identify other scientific studies and
books. In order to select words for a literature search to identify
infinite impacts, a process was established to identify words in the
scientific literature connected to global challenges with potentially
infinite impacts. Some words generate a lot of misses, i.e. publications
that use the term but are not the focus of this report. For example
"existential risk" is used in business; "human extinction" is used in
memory/cognition. Some search terms produced relatively few hits. For
example "global catastrophic risk" is not used much. Other words are
only used by people within a specific research community: few use
"existential risk" in our sense unless they are using Nick Bostrom's
work. The term "global catastrophe" was identified as a phrase that
referred almost exclusively to extremely negative impacts on humans, by
a diversity of researchers, not just people in one research community. A
list of 178 relevant books and reports was established based on what
other studies have referred to, and/or which are seen as landmark
studies by groups interviewed during the process. They were selected for
a closer examination regarding the challenges they include.76 The full
bibliography, even with its focus on publications of general interest,
is still rather long. So it is helpful to have a shorter list focused on
the highlights; the most important publications based on how often they
are quoted, how wellspread the content (methodology, lists, etc.) is and
how often key organisations use them. The publications included must
meet at least one of the following criteria: -- Historical significance.
This includes being the first publication to introduce certain key
concepts, or other early discussions of global challenges. Publications
of historical significance are important for showing the intellectual
history of global challenges. Understanding how the state of the art
research got to where it is today can also help us understand where it
might go in the future. -- Influential in developing the field. This
includes publications that are highly cited77 and those that have
motivated significant additional research. They are not necessarily the
first publications to introduce the concepts they discuss, but for
whatever reason they will have proved important in advancing research.
-- State of the art. This includes publications developing new concepts
at the forefront of global challenges research as well as those
providing the best discussions of important established concepts.
Reading these publications would bring a researcher up to speed with
current research on global challenges. So they are important for the
quality of their ideas. -- Covers multiple global challenges (at least
two). Publications that discuss a variety of global challenges are of
particular importance because they aid in identifying and comparing the
various challenges. This process is essential for research on global
risks to identify boundaries and research priorities. In order to
identify which global challenges are most commonly discussed, key
surveys were identified and coded. First, a list of publications that
survey at least three global challenges was compiled, and they were then
scanned to find which challenges they discussed. The publications that
survey many global challenges were identified from the full
bibliography. Publications from both the academic and popular literature
were considered. Emphasis was placed on publications of repute or other
significance.78 To qualify as a survey of global challenges, the
publication had to provide an explicit list of challenges or to be of
sufficient length and breadth for it to discuss a variety of challenges.
Many of the publications are books or book-length collections of
articles published in book form or as special issues of scholarly
journals. Some individual articles were also included because they
discussed a significant breadth of challenges. A total of 40 global
challenge survey publications were identified. For authors with multiple
entries (Bostrom with three and WEF with ten) each challenge was counted
only once to avoid bias. review of key literature 71 2.4.1 A scientific

In terms of authorship and audience, there are 17 academic publications,
9 popular publications, 1 government report, 3 publications written by
academics for popular audiences. In terms of format, there are 15 books,
5 edited collections, 7 articles, 3 of miscellaneous format. Of the 40
publications identified, 22 were available at the time of coding. In
addition, 10 Global Risks Reports from the World Economic Forum were
coded and then gathered under one heading: "WEF Global Risk Report
2005-2014". A list of 34 global challenges was developed based on the
challenges mentioned in the publications. A spreadsheet containing the
challenges and the publications was created to record mentions of
specific challenges in each publication to be coded. Then each
publication was scanned in its entirety for mentions of global
challenges. Scanning by this method was necessary because many of the
publications did not contain explicit lists of global challenges, and
the ones that did often mentioned additional challenges separately from
their lists. So it was not required that a global challenge be mentioned
in a list for it to be counted -- it only had to be mentioned somewhere
in the publication as a challenge. Assessing whether a particular
portion of text counts as a global challenge and which category it fits
in sometimes requires some interpretation. This is inevitable for most
types of textual analysis, or, more generally, for the coding of
qualitative data. The need for interpretation in this coding was
heightened by the fact that the publications often were not written with
the purpose of surveying the breadth of global challenges, and even the
publications that were intended as surveys did not use consistent
definitions of global challenges. The coding presented here erred on the
side of greater inclusivity: if a portion of text was in the vicinity of
a global challenge, then it was coded as one. For example, some
publications discussed risks associated with nuclear weapons in a
general sense without specifically mentioning the possibility of
large-scale nuclear war. These discussions were coded as mentions of
nuclear war, even though they could also refer to single usages of
nuclear weapons that would not rate as a global challenge. This more
inclusive approach is warranted because many of the publications were
not focused exclusively on global challenges. If they were focused on
them, it is likely that they would have included these risks in their
global challenge form (e.g., nuclear war), given that they were already
discussing something related (e.g., nuclear weapons). Below are the
results from the overview of the surveys. Figure 9: Number of times

literature that includes multiple global challenges with potentially
infinite impact is very small, given the fact that it is about the
survival of the human race. Experts in the field of global challenges,
like Nick Bostrom, have urged policymakers and donors to focus more on
the global challenges with infinite impacts and have used dramatic
rhetoric to illustrate how little research is being done on them
compared with other areas. However, it is important to note that many
more studies exist that focus on individual global risks, but often
without including low-probability high-impact outcomes.80 How much work
actually exists on human extinction infinite impact is therefore
difficult to assess. The list of risks found in the scientific
literature was checked against a review of what challenges key
organisations working on global challenges include in their material and
on their webpages. This was done to ensure that no important risk was
excluded from the list. The coding of key organisations paralleled the
coding of key survey publications. Organisations were identified via the
global catastrophic risk organisation directory published by the Global
Catastrophic Risk Institute.82 They were selected from the directory if
they worked on a variety of global challenges -- at least three, and
ideally more. The reason for focusing on those that work on multiple
challenges is to understand which challenges they consider important and
why. In contrast, organisations that focus on only one or two challenges
may not Figure 10: The global challenges included ten times or more in

according to which challenges they consider the most important. The
organisation coding used the same coding scheme developed for coding
survey publications. References to specific global challenges were
obtained from organisations' websites. Many have web pages which list
the topics they work on. Where possible, references to global challenges
were pulled from these pages. Additional references to these challenges
were identified by browsing other web pages, including recent
publications. While it is possible that some of these organisations have
worked on global challenges not mentioned on the web pages that were
examined, overall the main challenges that they have worked on have
probably been identified and coded. So the results should give a
reasonably accurate picture of what global challenges these
organisations are working on. Organisations working with global
challenges were initially selected on the basis of the literature
overview. A snowball sampling was conducted based on the list of
organisations identified, according to whether they claimed to work on
global challenges and/or their web page contained information about
"existential risk", "global catastrophic risk","human extinction" or
"greatest global challenges". Cross-references between organisations and
input during the workshops were also used to identify organisations. An
initial list of 180 organisations which work with global challenges was
established. Based on the production of relevant literature, which other
organisations referred to the organisation, and/or are seen as
influential by groups interviewed during the process, a short-list of
organisations were selected for a closer examination regarding the
challenges they work with. Then those working with multiple challenges
were selected, resulting in a list of 19 organisations.83 Below is the
overview of the results from the overview of key organisations working
with multiple global challenges. The organisations working on global
challenges vary widely in: 1. What they count as a global challenge 2.
How systematically they identify global challenges; and 3. Their
emphasis on the most important global challenges For most organisations
working with global challenges there are no explanations for the
methodology used to select the challenges. Only a few thought leaders,
like Tower Watson and their Extreme Risk Report 2013, have a framework
for the challenges and estimates of possible impacts. Figure 12: Global

2 6 10 14 In most cases there is neither a definition of the impact, nor
a definition of the probability. The report that focuses on global risk
which is probably best known is the WEF Global Risk Report. The WEF's
risk work, with many other groups', is probably best described as
belonging to the category of risk perception rather than risk
assessment, where experts are asked to estimate risks, but without any
clear definition of probability or impact. The more serious
organisations, like the WEF, also clearly define what they do as
discussing perception of risk, not a scientific assessment of the actual
risk. The WEF describes its perception methodology as follows: "This
approach can highlight areas that are of most concern to different
stakeholders, and potentially galvanise shared efforts to address them."
85 The question which people are asked to answer is: "What occurrence
causes significant negative impact for several countries and
industries?" 86 The respondents are then asked to provide a number on
two scales from 1-4, one for impact and another for likelihood (within
10 years).87 It is then up to the respondent to define what 1-4 means,
so the major value of the report is to track the changes in perception
over the years. Such perception approaches are obviously very
interesting and, as the WEF states, can influence actual probability as
the readers' decisions will be influenced by how different challenges
are perceived. Still, it is important to remember that the report does
not provide an assessment of the actual probability (0-100%) or an
assessment of the impact (and not the impact on human suffering, as many
respondents likely define risk in monetary terms for their own company
or country). An overview of WEF reports from the last ten years
indicates that the challenges that likely could happen when applying a
five year horizon, like the first signs of climate change, governmental
failure and traditional pandemic, are identified. On the other hand,
challenges which have very big impacts but lower probability, like
extreme climate change, nanotechnology, major volcanoes, AI, and
asteroids, tend to get less, or no, attention. An important question to
explore is whether a focus on the smaller but still serious impacts of
global challenges can result in an increased probability of infinite
impacts. For example, there are reasons to believe that a focus on
incremental adaptation instead of significant mitigation could be a
problem for climate change as it could result in high-carbon lock-in.88
Other research indicates that focus on commercially relevant smaller
pandemics could result in actions that make a major pandemic more
likely. It is argued that this could happen, for example, by encouraging
increased trade of goods while investing in equipment that scans for the
type of pandemics that are known. Such a system can reduce the
probability for known pandemics while at the same time resulting in an
increased probability for new and more serious pandemics.89 Figure 13:
The top 12 global challenges that key organisations work with 2.4.3
Workshops global risks 2.5 The list of Two workshops were arranged where
the selection of challenges was discussed, one with risk experts in
Oxford at the Future of Humanity Institute and the other in London with
experts from the financial sector. See Appendix 2 for agenda and
participants. In both workshops the list of global challenges was
discussed to see if any additional challenges should be included, or if
there were reasons to exclude some from the list. No challenge was
excluded at the workshops, but one was added. Although little research
exists yet that is able to verify the potential impacts, the
participants agreed to include Global System Collapse as a risk with
possible infinite impact. There was agreement that further research is
needed to clarify exactly what parts of the economic and political
system could collapse and result in a potentially infinite outcome. The
conclusion was that enough research exists to include such a collapse on
the list. Based on the risks identified in the literature review and in
the review of organisations and applying the criteria for potentially
infinite impact, these risks were identified: 1. Extreme Climate Change
2. Nuclear War 3. Global Pandemic 4. Ecological Catastrophe 5. Global
System Collapse 6. Major Asteroid Impact 7. Supervolcano 8. Synthetic
Biology 9. Nanotechnology 10. Artificial Intelligence (AI) 11. Unknown
Consequences 12. Future Bad Global Governance This is an initial list.
Additional risks will be added as new scientific studies become
available, and some will be removed if steps are taken to reduce their
probability90 and/or impact so that they no longer meet the criteria.
Four categories of global challenges The challenges included in this
report belong to four categories. The first, current challenges,
includes those where decisions today can result directly in infinite
impacts. They are included even if the time between action and impact
might be decades, as with climate change. The second category is
exogenous challenges, those where decisions do not -- currently --
influence probability, but can influence impact. The third category is
emerging challenges, those where technology and science are not advanced
enough to pose a severe threat today, but where the challenges will
probably soon be able to have an infinite impact. The technologies
included in emerging challenges, including synthetic biology,
nanotechnology and artificial intelligence (AI), will be critical to
finding solutions to infinite impacts. Including these technologies
should not be seen as an attempt to arrest them. If anything, the
development of sustainable solutions should be accelerated. But it is
equally important to create guidelines and frameworks to avoid their
misuse, whether intentional or accidental. The fourth category, future
global policy challenges, is of a different kind. It includes challenges
related to the consequences of an inferior or destructive global
governance system. This is especially important as well-intended actions
to reduce global challenges could lead to future global governance
systems with destructive impact. The first category, current challenges,
includes: 1. Extreme Climate Change 2. Nuclear War 3. Global Pandemic 4.
Ecological Catastrophe 5. Global System Collapse The second category,
exogenous challenges, covers: 6. Major Asteroid Impact 7. Supervolcano
Those in the third category, emerging challenges, are: 8. Synthetic
Biology 9. Nanotechnology 10. Artificial Intelligence (AI) 11. Unknown
Consequences The fourth category, global policy challenges, is: 12.
Future Bad Global Governance not included 2.5.1 Risks Many risks could
severely damage humanity but have not been included in this report. They
were excluded for one or more of three reasons: 1. Limited impact. Many
challenges can have significant local negative effects, without
approaching the "2 billion negatively affected" criterion - tsunamis,
for example, and chemical pollution. 2. No effective countermeasures.
The report focuses on promoting effective interventions and so ignores
challenges where nothing useful can be done to prevent or mitigate the
impact, as with nearby gamma-ray bursts. 3. Included in other
challenges. Many challenges are already covered by others, or have a
damage profile so similar that there seemed no need to have a separate
category. Population growth, for one, is an underlying driver
significant for climate change and eco-system catastrophe, but without
direct large-scale impacts. The challenges mentioned in the reviewed
literature and organisations which are not included in this report often
refer to economic damage such as "fiscal crises" or "unemployment".
While such impacts could have far-reaching consequences they are
obviously of another magnitude than those included here. Some of the
risks that were suggested and/or which exist in books and reports about
global risks were rejected according to the criteria above. They
include: 91 1. Astronomical explosion/nearby gamma-ray burst or
supernova.92 These seem to be events of extremely low probability and
which are unlikely to be survivable. Milder versions of them (where the
source is sufficiently far away) may be considered in a subsequent
report. ͢ Not included due to: No effective countermeasures 2. False
vacuum collapse. If our universe is in a false vacuum and it collapses
at any point, the collapse would expand at the speed of light destroying
all organised structures in the universe.93 This would not be
survivable. ͢ Not included due to: No effective countermeasures 3.
Chemical pollution. Increasingly, there is particular concern about
three types of chemicals: those that persist in the environment and
accumulate in the bodies of wildlife and people, endocrine disruptors
that can interfere with hormones, and chemicals that cause cancer or
damage DNA. ͢ Not included due to: Limited impact 4. Dangerous physics
experiments creating black holes/strangelets including high energy
physics. These risks are of low probability94 and have been subsumed
under "Uncertain Risks". ͢ Not included due to: Included in other
challenges 5. Destructive solar flares. Though solar flares or coronal
mass ejections could cause great economic damage to our technological
civilisation,95 they would not lead directly to mass casualties unless
the system lacks basic resilience. They have been subsumed in the Global
System Collapse category. ͢ Not included due to: Limited impact/included

2\. What Is GCR And Why Is It Important? [Taken **literally**, a global
catastrophe can be any event that is in some way catastrophic across the
globe]{.underline}. [This suggests a rather low threshold]{.underline}
for what counts as a global catastrophe. An event causing just one death
on each continent (say, from a jet-setting assassin) could rate as a
global catastrophe, because surely these deaths would be catastrophic
for the deceased and their loved ones. [However, in common usage, a
global catastrophe would be **catastrophic** for a significant portion
of the globe]{.underline}. Minimum thresholds have variously been set
around ten thousand to ten million deaths or \$10 billion to \$10
trillion in damages (Bostrom and Ćirković 2008), or death of one quarter
of the human population (Atkinson 1999; Hempsell 2004). [Others have
emphasized catastrophes that cause **long-term declines in the
trajectory of human civilization**]{.underline} (Beckstead 2013), [that
human civilization **does not recover from**]{.underline} (Maher and
Baum 2013), [that drastically reduce humanity's potential for future
achievements]{.underline} ([Bostrom]{.underline} 2002, [using the term
"**existential risk**"), or that result in **human
extinction**]{.underline} (Matheny 2007; Posner 2004). [A common theme
across all these treatments of GCR is that **some catastrophes are
vastly more important than others**]{.underline}. Carl Sagan was perhaps
the first to recognize this, in his commentary on nuclear winter (Sagan
1983). [Without nuclear winter, a global nuclear war might kill several
hundred million people. This is obviously a major catastrophe, but
humanity would presumably carry on. However, with **nuclear
winter**]{.underline}, per Sagan, [**[humanity]{.mark} [could go
extinct]{.mark}**. The loss would be not just an additional four billion
or so deaths, but the [loss of]{.mark} **all [future
generations]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} To paraphrase Sagan, [the
loss would be billions and billions of lives, or even
**more**]{.underline}. [Sagan estimated **[500 trillion]{.mark} lives**,
assuming humanity would continue for ten million more years, which he
cited as typical for a successful species. Sagan's 500 trillion number
may even be [an **underestimate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The analysis
here takes an adventurous turn, hinging on the evolution of the human
species and the long-term fate of the universe. On these long time
scales, the descendants of contemporary humans may no longer be
recognizably "human". The issue then is whether the descendants are
still worth caring about, whatever they are. If they are, then it begs
the question of how many of them there will be. Barring major global
catastrophe, Earth will remain habitable for about one billion more
years 2 until the Sun gets too warm and large. The rest of the Solar
System, Milky Way galaxy, universe, and (if it exists) the multiverse
will remain habitable for a lot longer than that (Adams and Laughlin
1997), should our descendants gain the capacity to migrate there. [An
open question in astronomy is whether it is possible for the descendants
of humanity to continue living for an **infinite length of time** or
instead merely an **astronomically large but finite** length of
time]{.underline} (see e.g. Ćirković 2002; Kaku 2005). Either way, [the
stakes with global catastrophes **could** be **much larger than the loss
of 500 trillion lives.** Debates about the infinite vs. the merely
astronomical are of theoretical interest]{.underline} (Ng 1991; Bossert
et al. 2007), [but they have **limited practical significance**. This
can be seen when **evaluating GCRs from a standard
[risk-equals-probability-times-magnitude]{.mark} framework**. Using
Sagan's 500 trillion lives estimate, it follows that reducing the
probability of global catastrophe by a mere one-in-500-trillion chance
is of the same significance as saving one human life. Phrased
differently, society should **try 500 trillion times harder to prevent a
global catastrophe than it should to save a person's life**. Or,
preventing one million deaths is equivalent to a one-in500-million
reduction in the probability of global catastrophe. This suggests
society should **make extremely large investment in GCR reduction, at
the expense of virtually all other objectives.**]{.underline} Judge and
legal scholar Richard Posner made a similar point in monetary terms
(Posner 2004). Posner used \$50,000 as the value of a statistical human
life (VSL) and 12 billion humans as the total loss of life (double the
2004 world population); he describes both figures as significant
underestimates. Multiplying them gives \$600 trillion as an
underestimate of the value of preventing global catastrophe. For
comparison, the United States government typically uses a VSL of around
one to ten million dollars (Robinson 2007). Multiplying a \$10 million
VSL with 500 trillion lives gives \$5x1021 as the value of preventing
global catastrophe. But even using "just\" \$600 trillion, [society
should be willing to spend]{.underline} at least that much to prevent a
global catastrophe, which converts to being willing to spend at least
[\$1 million for a one-in-500-million reduction in the probability of
global catastrophe]{.underline}. Thus [while reasonable disagreement
exists on how large of a VSL to use and how much to count future
generations, even low-end positions suggest **vast resource
allocations** should be redirected to reducing GCR. This conclusion is
only **strengthened** when considering the **astronomical size of the
stakes**]{.underline}, but the same point holds either way. The bottom
line is that, [as long as something along the lines of the standard
riskequals-probability-times-magnitude framework is being used, then
**even tiny GCR reductions** merit significant effort. This point holds
especially strongly for risks of catastrophes that would cause
**permanent harm to global human civilization**. The discussion thus far
has assumed that all human lives are valued equally. This assumption is
**not universally held**]{.underline}. [People often value some people
more than others]{.underline}, favoring themselves, their family and
friends, their compatriots, their generation, or others whom they
identify with. [Great debates rage on across moral philosophy,
economics, and other fields about how much people should value
others]{.underline} who are distant in space, time, or social relation,
as well as the unborn members of future generations. [This debate is
crucial]{.underline} for all valuations of risk, including GCR. Indeed,
if each of us only cares about our immediate selves, then global
catastrophes may not be especially important, and we probably have
better things to do with our time than worry about them. [While everyone
has the right to their **own views and feelings**]{.underline}, we find
that [[the strongest arguments are for the]{.mark} **widely held
position** that **all [human lives]{.mark} should be [valued
equally]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This position is succinctly stated in
the United States Declaration of Independence, updated in the 1848
Declaration of Sentiments: "We hold these truths to be self-evident:
that all men and 3 women are created equal". [[Philosophers speak of
a]{.mark}n agent-neutral, objective "view from nowhere"]{.underline}
(Nagel 1986) [or [a "veil of ignorance"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Rawls
1971) [[in which each]{.mark} person [considers what is best for society
**irrespective of which member**]{.mark} **of society [they happen to
be]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Such a perspective **suggests [valuing
everyone equally]{.mark}**, regardless of who they are or where or when
they live. This in turn [suggests a]{.mark} **very [high value for
reducing GCR]{.mark}**, or a high degree of priority for GCR reduction
efforts.]{.underline}

As, [an Account of the peculiar role responsibilities of [public
officials]{.mark}]{.underline} (and, by extension, of ordinary
individuals in their public capacities as citizens) [that vice becomes a
virtue, though. Those agents, too, have to [come from somewhere,
bringing]{.mark} with them [a]{.mark} whole [raft of]{.mark} baggage of
[personal attachments]{.mark}]{.underline}, [commitments, principles and
prejudices. In their public capacities,]{.underline} however, [we think
it only right and proper that they should stow that baggage as best they
can. [Complete neutrality might be]{.mark} an [impossible]{.mark}
ideal]{.underline}. That is another matter.\" [[But it seems]{.mark}
indisputable that that is an [ideal which people]{.mark} in their public
capacities]{.underline} [[should strive to]{.mark} realize]{.underline}
as best they are able. [That is]{.underline} part (indeed, [a central
part) of what it is to be a public official]{.underline} ,it all. It is
the essence of public service as such that public servants should serve
the public at large. [Public servants must not play
favor­ites.]{.underline} Or [[consider]{.underline}]{.mark}, again,
[[criticisms]{.mark} revolving [around the theme that
util­i]{.mark}tarianism [is]{.mark} a [cold]{.mark}ly
[calculating]{.mark} doctrine]{.underline}.23 In personal affairs that
is an unattractive feature. There, we would like to suppose that certain
sorts of actions proceed immediately from the heart, without much
reflection much less any real calculation of consequences. Among
in­timates it would be extremely hurtful to think of every kind gesture
as being contrived to produce some particular effect. [The case of
public officials is]{.underline}, once again, [precisely the
opposite]{.underline}. [There]{.underline}[, **[it is the height of
irresponsibility to proceed careless of]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the
[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [Public officials
ar]{.underline}]{.mark}[e]{.underline}, above all else, [obliged to take
care:]{.underline} not to go off half cocked, not to let their hearts
rule their heads. In Hare\'s telling example, the very worst thing that
might be said of the Suez misadventure was not that the British and
French did some per­fectly awful things (which is true, too) but that
they did so utterly unthinkingly.24 Related to the critique of
utilitarianism as a calculating doctrine is the critique of
utilitarianism as a consequentialist doctrine. According to
utilitarianism, the effects of an action are everything. There are no
actions which are, in and of themselves, morally right or wrong, good or
bad. The only things that are good or bad are the effects that actions
produce.25 That proposition runs counter to certain ethical intuitions
which, at least in certain quarters, are rooted deeply. Those who harbor
a Ten Commandments view of the nature of morality see a moral code as
being essentially a list of \"thou shalts\" and \"thou shall
nots[\"]{.underline} a list of things that are right or wrong in and of
themselves, quite regardless of any consequences that might come from
doing them.2\" That may or may not be a good way to run one\'s private
affairs.[^1]Even those who think it is, however, tend to concede that it
is no way to run public affairs. It is in the nature of [public
officials\']{.underline} role respon­sibilities that they [are **[morally
obliged to]{.mark} \"dirty their hands**]{.underline}\" - [**[make hard
choices,]{.mark}** do things that are wrong]{.underline} (or would
ordinarily be wrong, or would be wrong for ordinary private individuals)
[[in the service of some greater]{.mark} public
[good]{.mark}]{.underline}.[^2] [[It would be]{.underline}]{.mark}
simply [[irresponsible]{.underline}]{.mark} of public officials (in any
broadly secular society, at least) [[to adhere mindlessly to moral
precepts]{.mark} read off some sacred list, literally [\"whatever the
consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}[.\"]{.mark}[^3] [Doing right though
the heavens may fall is not]{.underline} (now­adays, anyway) [a
particularly attractive posture for public officials to]{.underline}
[adopt]{.underline}.

[What **turn-of-the-millennium [science]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[is
telling us]{.mark} is [that]{.mark} human **[moral judgment is not
a]{.mark} pristine [rational enterprise]{.mark}**]{.underline}, that our
[moral judgments are driven by a hodgepodge of emotional dispositions,
which themselves were shaped by a hodgepodge of evolutionary forces,
both biological and cultural]{.underline}. [Because of this[, it
is]{.mark} **exceedingly [unlikely]{.mark} that [there is any]{.mark}
rationally [coherent]{.mark} normative [moral theory that can

Moreover, [anyone who claims to have such a theory]{.underline}, or even
part of one, **[almost certainly doesn\'t]{.underline}**. Instead, what
that person probably has is a moral rationalization. It seems then, that
we have somehow crossed the infamous \"is\"-\"ought\" divide. How did
this happen? Didn\'t Hume (Hume, 1978) and Moore (Moore, 1966) warn us
against trying to derive an \"ought\" from and \"is?\" How did we go
from descriptive scientific theories concerning moral psychology to
skepticism about a whole class of normative moral theories? The answer
is that we did not, as Hume and Moore anticipated, attempt to derive an
\"ought\" from and \"is.\" That is, our method has been inductive rather
than deductive. We have inferred on the basis of the available evidence
that the phenomenon of rationalist deontological philosophy is best
explained as a rationalization of evolved emotional intuition (Harman,
1977). Missing the Deontological Point I suspect that [rationalist
deontologists will remain unmoved by the arguments presented
here]{.underline}. Instead, I suspect, [they]{.underline} [will insist
that I have **simply misunderstood what**]{.underline} Kant and
like-minded **[deontologists are all about]{.underline}**. [Deontology,
they will say, isn\'t about this intuition or that
intuition]{.underline}. It\'s not defined by its normative differences
with consequentialism. [Rather, deontology is about taking humanity
seriously]{.underline}. Above all else, it\'s about respect for persons.
It\'s about treating others as fellow rational creatures rather than as
mere objects, about acting for reasons rational beings can share. And so
on (Korsgaard, 1996a; Korsgaard, 1996b). [This is, no doubt, how many
deontologists see deontology. But this insider\'s view]{.underline}, as
I\'ve suggested, **[may be misleading]{.underline}**. [The
problem]{.underline}, more specifically, **[is that [it defines
deontology in terms of values that are not]{.mark} distinctively
[deontological]{.mark}]{.underline}**, though they may appear to be from
the inside. [Consider the following analogy with religion. When one asks
a religious person to explain the essence of his religion, one often
gets an answer like this: \"It\'s about love]{.underline}, really. It\'s
about looking out for other people, looking beyond oneself. It\'s about
community, being part of something larger than oneself.\" [This sort of
answer accurately captures the phenomenology of many people\'s religion,
but it\'s nevertheless inadequate for distinguishing religion from other
things]{.underline}. This is because many, if not most, non-religious
people aspire to love deeply, look out for other people, avoid
self-absorption, have a sense of a community, and be connected to things
larger than themselves. In other words, secular humanists and atheists
can assent to most of what many religious people think religion is all
about. From a secular humanist\'s point of view, in contrast, what\'s
distinctive about religion is its commitment to the existence of
supernatural entities as well as formal religious institutions and
doctrines. And they\'re right. These things really do distinguish
religious from non-religious practices, though they may appear to be
secondary to many people operating from within a religious point of
view. In the same way, I believe that most of [the standard
deontological/[Kantian self-characterizatons **fail to distinguish
deontology from other approaches to ethics**]{.mark}]{.underline}. (See
also Kagan (Kagan, 1997, pp. 70-78.) on the difficulty of defining
deontology.) It seems to me that
[[consequentialists]{.underline}]{.mark}, as much as anyone else,
**[have respect for persons]{.underline}**, [[are **against treating
people as**]{.mark} **mere [objects,]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[wish **to act for reasons that rational creatures can share**,
etc]{.underline}. [A consequentialist respects other persons, and
refrains from treating them as mere objects, [by **counting every
person\'s well-being**]{.mark} **in the decision-making
process**]{.underline}. [Likewise, a consequentialist attempts to act
according to reasons that rational creatures can share by acting
according to principles that **give equal weight to everyone\'s
interests**, i.e. that are impartial]{.underline}. This is not to say
that consequentialists and deontologists don\'t differ. They do. It\'s
just that the real differences may not be what deontologists often take
them to be. What, then, distinguishes deontology from other kinds of
moral thought? A good strategy for answering this question is to start
with concrete disagreements between deontologists and others (such as
consequentialists) and then work backward in search of deeper
principles. This is what I\'ve attempted to do with the trolley and
footbridge cases, and other instances in which deontologists and
consequentialists disagree. [[If you ask a
deontological]{.mark}ly-minded [person why it\'s wrong to push
someone]{.mark} in front of speeding trolley in order to [save five
others]{.mark}, you will get]{.underline} characteristically
deontological [[answers]{.underline}]{.mark}. Some [**[will be
tautological]{.underline}**:]{.mark} **[\"Because it\'s
murder!\"]{.underline}** [[Others will be more sophisticated]{.mark}:
\"The ends don\'t justify the means]{.underline}.\" \"You have to
respect people\'s rights.\" **[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as we know,
**[[these answers don\'t]{.mark} really [explain
anything]{.mark}]{.underline}**, because [if you give the same
people]{.underline} (on different occasions) [the trolley
case]{.underline} or the loop case (See above), **[they\'ll make the
opposite judgment]{.underline}**, even though their initial explanation
concerning the footbridge case applies equally well to one or both of
these cases. [Talk about rights, respect for persons, and reasons we can
share are natural attempts to explain, in \"cognitive\" terms, what we
feel when we find ourselves having emotionally driven intuitions that
are odds with the cold calculus of consequentialism]{.underline}.
Although these explanations are inevitably incomplete, **[[there seems
to be \"something deeply right\"]{.mark} about them [because they give
voice to powerful moral emotions]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
[But]{.underline}]{.mark}[, as with many religious people\'s accounts of
what\'s essential to religion, [they don\'t]{.mark} really
[explain]{.mark} what\'s distinctive about [the philosophy in
question]{.mark}]{.underline}. []{.mark}

**Prefer utilitarian approaches to policy that cast aside empathy \-\--
valuing how discussions make us feel rather than the truth of the
discussion ensures disastrous decision-making**

**Bloom 14** \[Paul Bloom, Brooks and Suzanne Ragen Professor of
Psychology & Cognitive Science at Yale University, "Against Empathy,
Boston Review, September 13, 2014,
<http://bostonreview.net/forum/paul-bloom-against-empathy>\]

When asked what I am working on, I often say [I am writing a book about
[empathy]{.mark}]{.underline}. People tend to smile and nod, and then I
add, "**[[I'm against it]{.underline}]{.mark}**." This usually gets an
uncomfortable laugh.

This reaction surprised me at first, but I've come to realize that
taking a position against empathy is like announcing that you hate
kittens---a statement so outlandish it can only be a joke. And so I've
learned to clarify, to explain that I am not against morality,
compassion, kindness, love, being a good neighbor, doing the right
thing, and making the world a better place. My claim is actually the
opposite: if you want to be good and do good, empathy is a poor guide.

The word "[empathy]{.underline}" is used in many ways, but here I am
adopting its most common meaning, which corresponds to what
eighteenth-century philosophers such as Adam Smith called "sympathy." It
[refers to the process of experiencing the world as others do, or at
least as you think they do. To empathize with someone is to put yourself
in her shoes, to feel her pain]{.underline}. Some researchers also use
the term to encompass the more coldblooded process of assessing what
other people are thinking, their motivations, their plans, what they
believe. This is sometimes called "cognitive," as opposed to
"emotional," empathy. I will follow this convention here, but we should
keep in mind that the two are distinct---they emerge from different
brain processes; you can have a lot of one and a little of the
other---and that [most of the discussion of the moral implications of
empathy focuses on its emotional side]{.underline}.

[Some degree of emotional empathy is bred in the bone. The sight and
sound of another's suffering is unpleasant for babies]{.underline} and,
as soon as they are mobile enough, [they try to help, patting and
soothing others in distress.]{.underline} This is not uniquely human:
the primatologist Frans de Waal notes that chimps will often put their
arms around the victim of an attack and pat her or groom her.

[Empathy can occur automatically, even involuntarily]{.underline}. Smith
describes how "persons of delicate fibres" who notice a beggar's sores
and ulcers "are apt to feel an itching or uneasy sensation in the
correspondent part of their own bodies." John Updike writes, "My
grandmother would have choking fits at the kitchen table, and my own
throat would feel narrow in sympathy."

And [empathy can be extended through the imagination]{.underline}. In a
speech before he became president, Barack Obama stressed how important
it is

to see the world through the eyes of those who are different from
us---the child who's hungry, the steelworker who's been laid off, the
family who lost the entire life they built together when the storm came
to town. . . . When you think like this---when you choose to broaden
your ambit of concern and empathize with the plight of others, whether
they are close friends or distant strangers---it becomes harder not to
act, harder not to help.

Obama is right about this last part; there is considerable support for
what the psychologist C. Daniel Batson calls "the empathy-altruism
hypothesis": when you empathize with others, you are more likely to help
them. In general, empathy serves to dissolve the boundaries between one
person and another; it is a force against selfishness and indifference.

It is easy to see, then, how empathy can be a moral good, and it has
many champions. Obama talks frequently about empathy; witness his recent
claim, after his first meeting with Pope Francis, that "it's the lack of
empathy that makes it very easy for us to plunge into wars. It's the
lack of empathy that allows us to ignore the homeless on the streets."
In The Empathetic Civilization (2009) Jeremy Rifkin argues that the only
way our species will survive war, environmental degradation, and
economic collapse is through the enhancement of "global empathy." This
past June, Bill and Melinda Gates concluded their Stanford commencement
address by asking students to nurture and expand their empathetic
powers, essential for a better world.

Most people see the benefits of empathy as akin to the evils of racism:
too obvious to require justification. I think this is a mistake. I have
argued elsewhere that [certain [features]{.mark} of empathy [make it a
poor guide to]{.mark} social [policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[Empathy
is biased]{.underline}]{.mark}**; [[we]{.mark} are more prone to
[feel]{.mark} empathy for [attractive people and]{.mark} for [those who
look like us]{.mark} or share our ethnic or national
background]{.underline}. And [[empathy is narrow]{.underline}]{.mark};
[[it]{.mark} connects]{.underline} [us to particular individuals, real
or imagined, but [is **insensitive to numerical differences and
statistical data**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As Mother Teresa put
it, "If I look at the mass I will never act. If I look at the one, I
will." Laboratory studies find that [we really do care more about the
one than]{.underline} [about the mass, so long as we have personal
information about the one]{.underline}.

In light of these features, **[[our public decisions will be]{.mark}
fairer and [more moral once we put empathy aside]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[Our **[policies are]{.mark} [improved when we appreciate that a hundred
deaths are worse than one]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [even if we know the
name of the one, [and when we]{.mark}]{.underline} [[acknowledge]{.mark}
that [the life of someone in a faraway country is worth as much as the
life a neighbor]{.mark}, [even if our emotions pull us in a
different]{.mark} [direction]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[Without
empathy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[we]{.mark} are [better]{.mark} able
to [grasp the importance of vaccinating children]{.mark} and responding
to climate change]{.underline}**. [[These]{.mark} acts [impose costs on
real people]{.mark} in the here and now [for the sake of **abstract
future benefits**]{.mark}, so [tackling them]{.mark} **[may require
overriding empathetic responses]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[that
favor the comfort and well-being of individuals today]{.underline}. [[We
can rethink]{.mark} humanitarian]{.underline} [aid and the [criminal
justice]{.mark} system, [choosing to draw on a
reasoned]{.mark}]{.underline}, even
**[[counter-empathetic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[analysis of]{.mark}
moral obligation and likely [consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**The presence of intervening actors doesn't decrease the moral
responsibility for your own actions**

**Cummiskey, 99** (David, professor of philosophy at Bates,
[Gewirth]{.underline}, ed: Boylan, p. 134-135)

Indeed, [the Principle of the [Intervening Action simply
asserts]{.mark}]{.underline} what must be shown. As Gewirth emphasizes,
[[all agents have a right not to be killed. The]{.mark} question at
[issue is whether it is sometimes obligatory to kill to prevent more
killings]{.mark}. [If one responds that it is not because another agent
is doing the killing, then one is]{.mark} simply [assuming that the
duty]{.mark} in question [is an agent-relative restriction]{.mark}. This
unargued assertion]{.underline}, however, [conflicts with the
basic]{.underline} PGC [requirement to respect the rights of all persons
affected by one's choice. [Since the persons being killed have a right
not to be killed, and since they are going to be killed as a result of
my refusal, they are indeed recipients of my action in the sense that is
decisive as far as morality is concerned]{.mark}]{.underline}. I thus
must act in light of the equal rights of all who will be killed if I
refuse and of the person who will be killed if I give in to the
terrorists. As we have seen above, all other things equal, [[the rights
of all will be more secure if we accept a principle where the rights of
a few give way to the rights of many]{.mark}. [The consequentialist
criterion]{.mark} of the degree of needfulness for action [requires a
cost-benefit analysis]{.mark} of the options]{.underline}. Since the
fewer people killed the more objective basic needs are protected, it
appears that the right of the many not to be killed outweigh the right
of the one not to be killed. Much more could be said about the principle
of intervening action. For present purposes, I only wish to focus our
attention on the central point: [[Gewirth has not provided an adequate
argument for this]{.mark} principle and,]{.underline} in the final
analysis, [the "criterion of degree of needfulness for
action]{.underline}," which follows directly from the PGC, [must
determine which course of action is unconditionally
obligatory]{.underline}. [[And this]{.mark} consequentialist
criterion]{.underline}, in principle, [[could clearly justify killing
some to prevent others from being killed]{.underline}]{.mark}. So the
PGC does not provide a basis for Gewirth's alleged absolute right not to
be killed as a means of preventing a nuclear catastrophe. Indeed, in
principle, the PGC could even justify killing one as a means of
preventing two others from being killed---if all other considerations
are indeed equal.

**[Predictions]{.underline}**

**Predictions of high-magnitude impacts are accurate and valuable.**

**Gleditsch 12** (Kristian S. Gleditsch, Department of Government,
University of Essex & Peace Research Institute Oslo, and Michael D.
Ward, Department of Political Science, Duke, 2012, "Forecasting is
difficult, especially about the future: Using contentious issues to
forecast interstate disputes," Journal of Peace Research, 50(1) 17--31,
Sage Journals)\
[There have been **remarkably few efforts** to generate]{.underline}
global [forecasts or risk profiles for interstate conflict]{.underline}.
Moreover, the most prominent efforts to consider the predictive ability
of models of interstate conflicts have based their research on models
that were not actually proposed with forecasting in mind. A notable
example here is Beck, King & Zeng (2000), who essentially adopt the
so-called liberal peace model of Russett & Oneal (2001). Certainly,
nothing akin to the Political Instability Task Force's now annual
projections (beginning with Gurr, Marshall & Khosla, 2000) exists for
international conflicts. Perhaps not surprisingly, [[many observers
are]{.mark} **very [skeptical]{.mark}** [of the ability]{.mark}
of]{.underline} academic [researchers [to anticipate conflict]{.mark}
between states]{.underline}, at least beyond very short time horizons.
Research in recent decades has seen a large number of hypotheses
generated to explain under what conditions militarized interstate
conflict is more or less likely. This avenue of research has been
primarily inspired by research on the so-called democratic peace, or the
absence of conflict between democracies. Indeed, there are thousands of
[scholarly works mentioning the term militarized interstate
dispute]{.underline} (MID), most of which [use these data for some kind
of empirical examination of a proposition about disputes]{.underline}.
Yet, the evidence suggests that [the ability of this body of work to
forecast conflict out-of-sample is **decidedly
disappointing**]{.underline}. Ward, Siverson & Cao (2007) found that
[most of the recent statistical studies]{.underline} of militarized
interstate disputes in prominent political science and international
relations journals [were unable to predict the outbreak of a single
dispute out-of-sample]{.underline} (see also Beck, King & Zeng, 2000).
Many researchers have sought to improve on the ability to forecast
militarized interstate conflict by turning to alternative statistical
methods. Beck, King & Zeng (2000), for example, find that neural
networks perform marginally better than generalized linear regression
models in forecasting conflict from the same input factors.1 Changes in
estimation methods or statistical techniques per se, however, have at
best led only to limited improvements in out-of-sample predictive
ability. Our argument is that **[[simply identifying inappropriate
methods]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as the key source of the problem in
forecasting conflict may [give]{.mark} us [the **wrong
diagnosis**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and lead us down less productive
avenues]{.underline}. A more fundamental problem is models that provide
a poor basis for forecasting by disregarding the motives for conflict to
arise, or by only considering motives in a relatively superficial
manner. [Models that have been proposed for research on the democratic
peace]{.underline}, notably the work of Russett & Oneal (2001), [are
primarily intended to examine whether certain characteristics of liberal
institutions]{.underline}, such as democracy and trade, [make conflict
on average less likely]{.underline} relative to baseline risks of
conflict. Although [these approaches]{.underline} may be appropriate for
testing the original propositions of interest, they essentially [ignore
the **contentious issues** that might cause states to resort to
violence]{.underline} and instead treat these contentious issues as
exogenous features, typically hidden inside a so-called 'black box' of
the baseline risk of conflict. Our own initial foray into out-of-sample
prediction for a state-level model indicates that spatial information
about other conflict events can help to improve forecasts (see Ward &
Gleditsch, 2002). Although this allows predictions of conflict to be
conditional on other observed events rather than treating each conflict
as an independent observation, the approach still ignores the issues
over which such conflicts may have arisen initially. We believe that
[greater [attention to the **specific reasons for**]{.mark} **the
occurrence of [conflicts]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the
[incompatibilities]{.mark} that may generate the use of violence can
help **[improve our ability to forecast conflict]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Although we recognize that different models may be appropriate to
evaluate particular propositions and to forecast events, in our view
[**the enterprise of [prediction has great potential]{.mark}** [for
winnowing bad ideas out of theories]{.mark} on the causes of conflict
[and avoiding]{.mark} the problem of [retrospective
biases]{.mark}]{.underline} in conventional hypothesis testing on the
data used to develop the hypotheses in the first place (see Ward,
Greenhill & Bakke, 2010). In fairness, [much of the existing work on the
statistical modeling of conflict has bypassed motivation]{.underline}
since it is genuinely difficult to establish what states fight over and
what their possible motivation for fighting might be. Nevertheless,
**[[the fact that something is difficult to evaluate does not
mean]{.mark} that simply [ignoring it is]{.mark} the [best]{.mark}
course of action]{.underline}**. Another tradition in research on
conflict has sought to identify incompatibilities in terms of
contentious issues, such as territorial or maritime claims (Diehl, 1992;
Mansbach & Vasquez, 1981). Recent efforts to examine these propositions
empirically have found considerable evidence that cases where such
claims exist are more likely to see militarized activities (Hensel,
2001; Hensel et al., 2008; Hensel & Mitchell, 2010). Even so, at present
this line of research has primarily engaged in testing hypotheses about
whether coefficient estimates are significantly different from 0 or the
in-sample post-diction of conflicts, and has not yet examined if
information on contentious issues may be helpful for forecasting dyadic
conflict out-of-sample. Here we explicitly consider whether [taking into
account information on contentious issues and conflict management
can]{.underline} help [improve on forecasting interstate conflict
and]{.underline} our understanding of [conflict dynamics]{.underline}.
Although we focus on statistical approaches to interstate conflict in
this article, [many of our arguments also apply to problems in
traditional theories of conflict and qualitative approaches to
prediction or anticipating political events]{.underline} (see Tetlock,
2005). [Traditional theories of interstate conflict tend to focus on
**structural features** presumed to influence the opportunities for
conflict such as the distribution of power]{.underline} in the
international system or relative balance of power (see e.g. Waltz,
1979). These theories display little interest in the specific
incompatibilities that may motivate the use of violence. However,
structural factors rarely change rapidly, but [violent conflict tends to
be episodic, and]{.underline} hence [cannot be adequately explained
merely by reference to permissive conditions]{.underline} (see Fearon,
1995). Likewise, our core argument applies to studies of civil war,
which tend to emphasize opportunities for conflict rather than
motivations for conflict (see Cederman, Weidmann & Gleditsch, 2011), and
where evidence for the predictive ability of existing statistical
efforts seems similarly disappointing (see Ward, Greenhill & Bakke,
2010). Many political and area study experts, typically using informal
methods for deriving predictions, often have strong confidence in their
ability to forecast events. However, the comprehensive series of studies
by Tetlock (2005), who asked experts to rate a series of outcomes which
could then be compared against the historical record, provide little
support for the forecasting ability of political experts.

**[Political [events are frequently framed as unpredictable]{.mark}. Who

**[Still, major advances did result]{.underline}** from these efforts.

Stevens' point---which was taken up by the US Congress---was that

efforts that did not provide accurate policy advice. **[In contrast to

that the **[[increasing availability of]{.mark} disaggregated [data and

**Turn---rejecting predictions makes them inevitable---decisionmakers
will rely on ideology instead of analysis**

**Fitzsimmons 7** (Michael, "The Problem of Uncertainty in Strategic
Planning", Survival, Winter 06/07)

But handling even this weaker form of uncertainty is still quite
challeng- ing. [If not sufficiently bounded, a high degree of
variability in planning factors can exact a significant price on
planning. The complexity presented by great variability strains the
cognitive abilities of even the most sophisticated decision-
makers]{.underline}.15 And even a robust decision-making process
sensitive to cognitive limitations necessarily sacrifices depth of
analysis for breadth as variability and complexity grows. It should
follow, then, that [in planning under conditions of risk, variability in
strategic calculation should be carefully tailored to available analytic
and decision processes]{.underline}. Why is this important? What harm
can an imbalance between complexity and cognitive or analytic capacity
in strategic planning bring? Stated simply, [[where analysis is
silent]{.mark} or inadequate, **the personal [beliefs of
decision-makers]{.mark}** [**fill the void**]{.mark}.]{.underline} As
political scientist Richard Betts found in a study of strategic sur-
prise, [[in 'an environment that lacks clarity,]{.mark} abounds with
conflicting data, and allows no time for rigorous assessment of sources
and validity, ambiguity allows intuition or wishfulness to drive
interpretation]{.underline} [\... [The greater the ambiguity, the
greater the impact of preconceptions]{.mark}]{.underline}.'16 The
decision-making environment that Betts describes here is one of
political-military crisis, not long-term strategic planning. But [[a
strategist who sees uncertainty as the central fact]{.underline}]{.mark}
of his environ- ment [brings upon]{.underline} himself [some of the
pathologies of crisis decision-making]{.underline}. He [[invites
ambiguity,]{.mark} takes conflicting data for granted [and
**substitutes**]{.mark} **a priori [scepticism about]{.mark} the
validity of [prediction]{.mark}**]{.underline} for time pressure [[as a
rationale for discounting]{.mark} the importance of [analytic
rigour]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is important not to exaggerate the
extent to which data and 'rigorous assessment' can illuminate strategic
choices. Ambiguity is a fact of life, and scepticism of analysis is
necessary. Accordingly, the intuition and judgement of decision-makers
will always be vital to strategy, and attempting to subordinate those
factors to some formulaic, deterministic decision-making model would be
both undesirable and unrealistic. All the same, there is danger in the
opposite extreme as well. [[Without]{.mark} careful [analysis of what
is]{.mark} relatively [likely]{.mark} and what is relatively unlikely,
[what will be the]{.mark} possible [bases for]{.mark} strategic
[choices?]{.mark}]{.underline} [[A decision-maker with no faith in
prediction is left with little more than]{.underline}]{.mark} a set of
worst-case scenarios and his [[existing beliefs]{.mark} about the
world]{.underline} to confront the choices before him. [Those beliefs
may be more or less well founded, but if they are not made explicit and
subject to analysis and debate regarding their application to particular
strategic contexts, they remain only beliefs and premises, rather than
rational judgements. Even at their best, such decisions are likely to be
poorly understood by the organisations charged with their
implementation.]{.underline} At their worst, such decisions may be
poorly understood by the decision-makers themselves.

[In]{.underline} the [social sciences the [explanations]{.mark} of state
behaviour in rational-choice theory]{.underline}, which posits the
existence of a rationally behaving state, [or in economics]{.underline},
which posits the existence of 'the rational economic person', [[are
clearly idealisations]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, [[these are
parallel to]{.underline}]{.mark} -- and not completely disconnected from
-- the [postulation of]{.underline} [laws governing [frictionless
machines or ideal gases]{.mark} in the physical sciences]{.underline}.
With regard to underlying and immediate causes, [[Bernstein et
al.]{.underline}]{.mark} advance a number of points in the course of
offering the [[critique]{.underline}]{.mark} of 'predictiveness' of IR
theory and the scenario-based alternative that Bernstein et al. present.
The main point to be made with respect to the use made by Bernstein et
al. of the 'uncertain relationships between underlying and immediate
causes' is that, in their view, such a connection 'makes [[point
prediction]{.underline}]{.mark} extraordinarily difficult' (2000: 47).
As will become clear, [this chapter argues that IR theorists offer
non-point predictions and that such predictions are]{.underline} often
[of genuine policy value. A statement like]{.underline} 'a [rapid
withdrawal of US military forces]{.underline} from Iraq after the defeat
of Saddam Hussein [is likely to lead to increased violence and long-term
instability', would not qualify as a point prediction. Yet it is the
sort of prediction that policymakers typically rely on and it has value
for policy-makers]{.underline}. [[Bernstein et al.]{.underline}]{.mark}
thus [[commit a straw-**person fallacy**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as do
other critics of 'predictiveness' discussed above. [They raise the bar
of 'prediction' much too high. [The sort of
prediction]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}that [[policy-makers need is
often much less than 'point]{.mark} prediction'.]{.underline} One may
grant Bernstein et al. all of their points seeking to undermine point
prediction and still conclude that they have not provided good reason to
reject many sorts of statements that satisfy the requirements of
prediction, as laid out in the definition on p. 8. With regard to
learning, IR differs from predictive natural sciences in that, according
to Bernstein et al., '\[m\]olecules do not learn from experience. People
do, or think they do. ... We know that expectations and behavior are
influenced by experience, one's own and others' (2000: 47). They argue
that US policies visàvis the USSR were a response to the failure of
appeasement in the 1930s, and those policies were a response to British
leaders' belief that more aggressive policies failed to keep peace in
1914. They cite concepts like 'chain reactions' and 'contagion effects'
to describe these phenomena and hazard analysis for their measurement.
But they charge that these do not succeed in explaining 'how and why
these patterns emerge and persist' (Bernstein et al. 2000: 47). [[They
note also that theories]{.underline}]{.mark} that attempt to predict the
future [[predict incorrectly in part because]{.underline}]{.mark} groups
(often [[states) react]{.underline}]{.mark} in such a way as [[to
prevent]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[predictions]{.underline}]{.mark}
from obtaining. 'Human prophecies ... are often self-negating'
(Bernstein et al. 2000: 52). Another approach that has considerable
explanatory success is cybernetic theory, which lays out mechanisms and
may even be viewed as predictive. Cybernetic theory was developed by
Wiener (1949) and applied to IR especially by Deutsch et. al (1957), and
specifically to foreign-policy decision-making by Steinbruner (1974),
Chernoff (1995) and others. It not only accords with the data but offers
a causal mechanism to account for the patterns. [Bernstein et al. argue
that]{.underline} actors can change 'the rules of the game' and
consequently 'general theories of process in international relations
will have restricted validity' (Bernstein et al. 2000: 52).
Generalisations will apply only to 'discrete portions' of history. They
add that ['scholars need to specify carefully the temporal and
geographic domains to which their theories are applicable. We suspect
those domains are often narrower and more constrained than is generally
accepted']{.underline} (Bernstein et al. 2000: 52). [This is, however,
just what one of the most systematic and generalising of all IR
scholars, i.e., Waltz, demands. He maintains that a body of propositions
does not even qualify as a theory unless it so specifies]{.underline}.
Once these restrictions on domain are specified, theoretical
generalisations might have value. For example, Waltz says that whether
we are interested in natural sciences or social sciences, '\[n\]o matter
what the subject, we have to bound the domain of our concern, to
organize it, to simplify the materials we deal with, to concentrate on
the central tendencies, and to single out the strongest propelling
forces' (1979: 68). He later adds, '\[t\]o be a success ... a theory has
to show how international politics can be conceived of as a domain
distinct from economic, social, and other international domains that one
may conceive of ' (1979: 79). So it is not accurate to suggest that IR
theorists, at least careful ones, do not bound or constrain the scope of
their studies and generalisations. While bounded theories may offer
predictions, the fallible nature of all empirical knowledge and the
probabilistic nature of IR laws does restrict what can be predicted. The
longer the chain of reasoning and the greater the number of
probabilistic propositions that are conjoined, the less one may rely on
the predicted event. But this is an argument for limitations on certain
types of predictions, not an argument against the predictiveness of IR
or social science theory. Bernstein et al. note also that there is the
problem of the 'single case'. [[They]{.mark} correctly [observe that
policy-makers often worry about a single instance]{.mark} of an event
type (e.g., possible war with our neighbours on our western frontier in
the next year) rather than with general propositions (e.g., the problem
of war in general, or great-power war, etc.). First, with regard to the
relevance of theory to policy, it is important to note that
[policy-makers do sometimes care about longrun
patterns]{.mark}]{.underline} or generalisations in some of their
decision-situations. [Long-run generalisations are very frequently
important for policy-makers. For example, in the 1990s, numerous new
states emerged in Europe and central Asia due to the collapse of the
Soviet Union]{.underline} and the end of its domination of central
eastern Europe. [Policy-makers had to understand as correctly as
possible the truth of generalisations in DP theory in order to decide
how much in the way of financial and diplomatic resources should be
committed]{.underline} to help promote democratic polities in the
region. [Policy-makers in 1994 were not primarily worried about a
specific war, say, between Hungary and Slovakia, but rather the long-run
chances of conflict arising in a Europe with many nondemocratic
states]{.underline} as compared to a Europe with very few such states.
Policy-makers could consider two alternative scenarios of the future.
One is a Europe with some democratic states and many non-democratic
ones, possibly including a non-democratic Russia. The other one
envisions a Europe with virtually all democratic states. The
generalisations about the effects of democracy on behaviour would allow
policy-makers to draw general conclusions about peace and international
stability from each scenario.

**[AT: Structural Violence]{.underline}**

**War turns structural violence and no tradeoff**

than \"Root Causes\"", Scientific American, 8-18,
https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/to-end-war-focus-on-culture-rather-than-root-causes/

When I started researching war, [I]{.underline} also [assumed that to
get rid of war, we have to get rid of its root causes. The trouble is,
[scholars]{.mark} have [identified countless causes of war]{.mark}. One
pseudo-explanation]{.underline} (which I\'m glad Kloor does not mention,
and which I rebut early on in my book and in posts such as this) [is
that war stems from]{.underline} a compulsion bred into our ancestors by
natural selection. [Biology]{.underline} underpins war, as it underpins
all human behaviors. The crucial question is, why does war break out in
certain places and times and not others? [The most popular
non-biological explanations]{.underline} of war [are]{.underline} what I
call [the **Malthusian** and **Marxist** hypotheses. The
first]{.underline} posits [that war stems from our tendency to
over-reproduce and hence fight over land and other resources. The second
holds that war stems from inequality, the tendency of societies
(especially capitalist ones) to divide into haves and
have-nots]{.underline}. [[Scholars]{.mark} have]{.underline} also
[[blamed]{.mark} wars on [**religion**, **racism** and
**nationalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which Kloor mentions above, [[as
well as]{.mark} such **fundamental [social traits]{.mark}** as
hierarchy, sexism and injustice. [If you **cherry pick**, you]{.mark}
**always [find evidence]{.mark}** to support your favorite
theory]{.underline}. [[But]{.mark} as scholars]{.underline} such as
Lewis Fry Richardson (whom my friend David Berreby recently profiled)
[have shown]{.underline}, neither the Malthusian and Marxist theories
**[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}**r any of the other **[[explanations]{.mark}
above can [account for the]{.mark} vast [diversity of
wars]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover, [some factors that provoke
conflict]{.underline}, such as religion, [can also inhibit
it]{.underline}. Religion has inspired some of our greatest antiwar
leaders, notably Gandhi and Martin Luther King. I have found [only one
theory of war that fits the facts]{.underline}. The theory holds [that
[war]{.mark} is a self-perpetuating, contagious meme, which [can
propagate **independently of**]{.mark} **other [social]{.mark} and
environmental [factors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As anthropologist
Margaret Mead put it in a famous 1940 essay, \"Warfare Is Only an
Invention---Not a Biological Necessity.\" In other words, the major
cause of war is war itself, which has a terrible tendency to spread even
to societies that would prefer to remain peaceful. I make this point in
my book and in a 2010 blog post, \"Margaret Mead's war theory kicks butt
of neo-Darwinian and Malthusian models.\" Here is an edited excerpt: In
his 1997 book War Before Civilization, anthropologist Lawrence Keeley
notes that war among North American Indians often stemmed from the
aggression of just a few extremely warlike tribes, \"rotten apples that
spoiled their regional barrels.\" He added, \"Less aggressive societies,
stimulated by more warlike groups in their vicinity, become more
bellicose themselves.\" Societies in a violent region, the political
scientist Azar Gat emphasizes in his 2006 book War in Human
Civilization, have a strong incentive to carry out preemptive attacks.
Societies may \"attack the other side in order to eliminate or severely
weaken them as a potential enemy. Indeed, this option only makes the
other side more insecure, rendering the security dilemma more acute. War
can thus become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The fear of war breeds
war.\" [[Many]{.mark} people [are **pessimistic**]{.mark} about ending
war because [they assume it will require **radical**]{.mark} **social
[engineering]{.mark}**. World peace will require eliminating poverty,
inequality, sexism, **racism** or **\[fill in the
blank\]**.]{.underline} We will need to eradicate religion, or all
embrace the same religion. We will need to get rid of all nation states
and become anarchists, or form a single global government. [My
analysis]{.underline} of war [suggests that if we want to end war, **[we
don\'t need]{.mark} to create [a society radically different]{.mark}**
from our own, let alone a utopia. If we want to end war, we should
[focus on ending war]{.mark}]{.underline} and the culture of war
[[rather than]{.mark} on **[supposed causal factors]{.mark}**. If we can
do that, [we will **take a major step toward solving
many**]{.mark}]{.underline} of our **[[other]{.mark} social
[problems]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as I argued in my previous post. And
that brings me to Keith Kloor\'s final challenge to me. He devotes much
of his column to a discussion of how extremists on both sides of the
conflict between Israel and Palestine have \"hijacked the peace process.
Horrific spasmodic cycles of violence and death is the result.\" He asks
me how we can \"rid the world of extremist groups that sow the seeds of
war.\" [Kloor [has]{.mark}]{.underline} his [**[causation
backwards]{.mark}**. Just as [war promotes]{.mark} poverty, tyranny,
[inequality]{.mark} and resource depletion **[at least as much as vice
versa]{.mark}**]{.underline}, so war promotes fanaticism. Once
militarism seizes hold of a society, it can transform vast populations
into virtual sociopaths. It turns decent, ethical, reasonable people
into intolerant fanatics capable of the most heinous acts. [Breaking out
of]{.underline} what Kloor calls \"spasmodic [cycles of
violence]{.underline} and death\" [can be]{.underline} extraordinarily
[difficult, but history offers many examples of societies that have done
just that. Germany and France were bitter, bloody rivals for centuries.
But it is now inconceivable that Germany and France]{.underline}---or
any members of the European Union\--[would go to war]{.underline}
against each other. [One of my favorite examples of a nation that has
renounced militarism is Costa Rica]{.underline}. Like many of its
neighbors in Central American, Costa was once wracked by terrible
violence. But [after a bloody civil war in the 1940s, Costa Rica
disbanded its army]{.underline}, freeing up more funds for education,
health care, transportation and tourism. It is often ranked as one of
the most peaceful, healthy, \"happy\" nations in the world.

**Root cause explanations of international politics don't exist. Their
attempt to impose a universal root cause results in unchecked
reification and a larger example of what they're critiquing.**

**Bleiker 14** -- (6/17, Roland, Professor of International Relations at
the University of Queensland, "International Theory Between Reification
and Self-Reflective Critique," International Studies Review, Volume 16,
Issue 2, pages 325--327)

This book is part of an increasing trend of scholarly works that have
embraced poststructural critique but want to ground it in more positive
political foundations, while retaining a reluctance to return to the
positivist tendencies that implicitly underpin much of constructivist
research. The path that Daniel Levine has carved out is innovative,
sophisticated, and convincing. A superb scholarly achievement.

For Levine, [[the key challenge in]{.underline}]{.mark} international
relations (**[IR]{.underline}**) scholarship [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
what he calls **[["unchecked reification"]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [the
widespread and [dangerous]{.mark} process of forgetting "the distinction
between theoretical concepts and the real-world things they mean to
describe]{.underline} or to which they refer" (p. 15). [The dangers are
real]{.underline}, Levine stresses, [[because **IR deals with** some of
the most difficult issues,]{.mark} from **genocides to
war**]{.underline}. [[Upholding one subjective position without critical
scrutiny can]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[have **far-reaching
consequences**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Following Theodor Adorno---who is
the key theoretical influence on this book---Levine takes a
post-positive position and assumes that the world cannot be known
outside of our human perceptions and the values that are inevitably
intertwined with them. His ultimate goal is to overcome reification, or,
to be more precise, to recognize it as an inevitable aspect of thought
so that its dangerous consequences can be mitigated.

[[Levine]{.underline}]{.mark} proceeds in three stages: First he reviews
several decades of IR theories to resurrect critical moments when
scholars displayed an acute awareness of the dangers of reification. He
refreshingly breaks down distinctions between conventional and
progressive scholarship, for he [[detects self-reflective]{.mark} and
critical [moments in]{.mark}]{.underline} scholars that are usually
associated with [straightforward [positivist
positions]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as E.H. Carr, Hans Morgenthau, or
Graham Allison). But Levine also shows how these moments of
self-reflexivity never lasted long and were driven out by the compulsion
to offer systematic and scientific knowledge.

The second stage of Levine\'s inquiry [[outlines
why]{.underline}]{.mark} IR scholars regularly closed down critique.
Here, he points to a range of factors and phenomena, from peer review
processes to the speed at which academics are meant to publish. And here
too, he eschews conventional wisdom, showing that work conducted in the
wake of the third debate, [while [explicitly
post-positivist]{.mark}]{.underline} and critiquing the reifying
tendencies of existing [[IR]{.underline}]{.mark} [scholarship, [often
lacked critical self-awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a result, Levine
believes that many of the [respective authors failed to appreciate
sufficiently that]{.underline} "**[reification is a consequence of all
thinking]{.underline}**---including itself" (p. 68).

The third objective of Levine\'s book is also the most interesting one.
Here, he outlines the path toward what he calls "[sustainable
critique]{.underline}": a form of self-reflection that can counter the
dangers of reification. Critique, for him, is [not just something that
is directed outwards, against particular theories or
theorists]{.underline}. [It is also inward-oriented, ongoing, and
sensitive to the "limitations of thought itself"]{.underline} (p. 12).

The challenges that such a sustainable critique faces are formidable.
Two stand out: First, if the natural tendency to forget the origins and
values of our concepts are as strong as Levine and other Adorno-inspired
theorists believe they are, then how can we actually recognize our own
reifying tendencies? Are we not all inevitably and subconsciously caught
in a web of meanings from which we cannot escape? Second, if one
constantly questions one\'s own perspective, does one not fall into a
relativism that loses the ability to establish the kind of stable
foundations that are necessary for political action? Adorno has, of
course, been critiqued as relentlessly negative, even by his
second-generation Frankfurt School successors (from Jürgen Habermas to
his IR interpreters, such as Andrew Linklater and Ken Booth).

The response that Levine has to these two sets of legitimate criticisms
are, in my view, both convincing and useful at a practical level. [He
starts off with depicting reification not as a flaw that is meant to be
expunged, but as an a priori condition for scholarship]{.underline}. The
challenge then is not to let it go unchecked.

**[[Methodological pluralism lies at the heart of]{.mark} Levine\'s
[sustainable critique]{.mark}]{.underline}**. He borrows from what
Adorno calls a "constellation": an attempt to juxtapose, rather than
integrate, different perspectives. It is in this spirit that Levine
advocates **[[multiple methods to understand the same event or
phenomena]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [He writes of the need to validate
"multiple and mutually incompatible ways of seeing"]{.underline} (p. 63,
see also pp. 101--102). In this model, [[a scholar oscillates]{.mark}
back and forth between [different methods and
paradigms]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[trying to understand]{.mark} the event
in question [from multiple perspectives]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[No
single method can ever adequately represent the event]{.mark} or should
gain the upper hand]{.underline}**. [[But each
should]{.underline}]{.mark}, in a way, **[[recognize and capture details
or perspectives that the others cannot]{.underline}]{.mark}** (p. 102).
[In practical terms[, this means **combining**]{.mark} **a range of
[methods]{.mark}** even when]{.underline}---**[or, rather, [precisely
when]{.mark}]{.underline}**---[[they are deemed
incompatible]{.underline}]{.mark}. [They can **range from poststructual
deconstruction** to the tools pioneered and championed by]{.underline}
**[positivist social sciences]{.underline}**.

[[The benefit of]{.mark} such]{.underline} a **[[methodological
polyphony]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[is not just the opportunity to bring
out nuances and new perspectives]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Once the false
hope of a smooth synthesis has been abandoned, the very incompatibility
of the respective perspectives can then be used to identify the reifying
tendencies in each of them]{.underline}. For Levine, this is how
**[[reification may be "checked at the source"]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and]{.underline} this is how [a "critically reflexive moment might thus
be rendered sustainable"]{.underline} (p. 103). It is in this sense that
[Levine\'s approach is not really post-foundational but]{.underline},
rather, [an attempt to "balance foundationalisms against one
another"]{.underline} (p. 14). There are strong parallels here with
arguments advanced by assemblage thinking and complexity theory---links
that could have been explored in more detail.

**Threats are real and the process of identifying them is valuable**

California, San Diego, July 2005, "International Relations as a Social
Science: Rigor and Relevance," Annals of the American Academy of
Political and Social Science, No. 600, p. 136-156

International relationists have long been involved in foreign policy
debates. The pages of thoughtful journals of opinion like Foreign
Affairs or Foreign Policy are often filled by academics writing for
broad audiences. And professors, of course, have frequently engaged in
government service. [There will always be a need for policy-relevant
expertise]{.underline}. Through a lifetime of study, [even the most
theoretically inclined academics accumulate substantial country- or
policy-specific knowledge that can supplement that possessed by those in
government]{.underline}. [Universities are repositories of country and
policy experts "on call" to buttress hard-pressed policy makers
confronted with crises]{.underline} in countries or over issues for
which they l ack immediate knowledge. Yet in nearly all cases, the
academics involved in past policy debates have acted as individuals, not
as the embodiments of the accumulated knowledge of scholars of
international relations. Rather, [the real [test of relevance is what
the discipline provides in]{.mark} the way of approaches, theories, and
analytical [tools]{.mark} that can be marshaled [to **explain why events
happen** and **what can be done**]{.mark} **to alter the course of
future events**. [I]{.mark}nternational [R]{.mark}elations [makes
its]{.mark} biggest [contribution]{.mark}]{.underline}---is most
relevant---[[when]{.mark} it is [**most "scientific**."]{.mark} These
contributions are of two types: well-developed]{.underline}, coherent,
and [convincing theoretical arguments [for which there is]{.mark}
**systematic [empirical support]{.mark}**; and empirical evidence for
a]{.underline} regularity, "law," or other [relationship that appears to
hold beyond a reasonable doubt]{.underline}. [**Only when International
Relations brings science to the discussion** does it have **anything of
enduring value to offer**]{.underline}, beyond well-informed opinion.
And observers, [policy makers]{.underline}, and journalists [should be
most influenced when scholars have something that is of enduring value
to say]{.underline}. **[Theory is not a substitute for policy
expertise]{.underline}**, problem-solving abilities, or political
experience; nor does it trump political struggle. [Theories of
international relations aim to capture general features of events and
processes in ways that highlight their principal causes]{.underline}.
Successful decision makers typically understand these forces
intuitively, at least in the instances with which they are familiar. But
[explicit attention to scientific rigor can provide a degree of
generality and clarity that might not be obvious even to experienced
policy makers]{.underline}. [[Theory]{.mark} can]{.underline} also
[[discipline]{.mark} the [thinking]{.mark} of [policy makers so]{.mark}
that **[sloppy]{.mark}**]{.underline} or **[[wishful]{.mark} [thinking
does not lead them]{.mark} astray]{.underline}**. The [scientific study
of international politics provides a logical and empirical check on
attempts to draw inferences from the ideas]{.underline} or experiences
[of those who may be too close to the events they wish to
influence]{.underline}. It would be a foolish policy maker who relied
only on the scientific approach for guidance, but well-specified
theories and tests of international relations are an essential part of a
sound policy-making process.

**Security threats don't cause militarization**

Vera **Zimmerman 15** has served as a research analyst at the Hudson
Institute. Her scholarship has been published in World Politics Review.
The author is currently a graduate student of political science in the
Department of Public and International Affairs at George Mason
University. Article Title "Book Review: The Theater of Operations:
National Security Affect from the Cold War to the War on Terror. By
Joseph Masco Durham and London: Duke University Press" -- May 23^rd^,
2015 -- Modified for potentially objectionable language - available at:

In chapter four, "Biosecurity Noir: WMDs in a World without Borders,"
Masco singles out concrete evidence of the amplification of the
invisible biothreat triggered by the receipt of a few anthrax letters in
2001 to support his argument about the made-up ambiguous link to WMD.
[[The author highlights that]{.underline}]{.mark} by [proliferating
visions [(depictions) of]{.mark} catastrophic
[danger]{.mark}]{.underline}, biosecurity [[create]{.underline}]{.mark}d
[[a militarized response]{.underline}]{.mark} [**of global preemption**
in the name of domestic defense.]{.underline} Masco argues his case well
and sharply, providing compelling evidence, but his interpretations of
evidence at times seems exaggerated and biased. Though Masco does not
deny the existence of the real threats, his recognition of them is too
brief, while consideration of an alternative view is rather weak. He
acknowledges that terrorist violence is not fictitious but insists that
for the most part the United States inflated threats and politically
exploited potential danger to declare and maintain the state of
emergency. Such focus on the amplification of threats seems to suggest
that for the most part the threats are not that real. Masco suggests
that the link between terrorists and WMD is mainly inflated. [[Yet
the]{.underline}re]{.mark} is a real global concern about 2,000 tons of
highly-radioactive nuclear materials being stored in poorly secured
civilian locations around the world. The book never mentions the threat
of a dirty bomb, which today is viewed as a more likely occurrence than
an atomic bomb explosion. The IAEA cites a hundred reported thefts of
nuclear materials on average each year. There is a good chance
terrorists can get their hands on enough nuclear materials to produce a
dirty bomb. The United States meets these challenges with increased
international cooperation. Masco's [main [argument]{.mark} that "the US
is no longer constrained by territorial limits" [is
**exaggerated**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The only two cases cited when the
United States appeared unconstrained were the invasion of Iraq. Though
the invasion of Iraq was opposed by some U.S. allies (France, Germany,
and New Zealand), it was still a combined force coalition from the U.S.,
the UK, Australia, and Poland. [[The U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}]{.underline}tates [[does not have]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[[unrestricted reach]{.underline}]{.mark} as Masco wants to depict. [It
is constrained by sovereignty and territorial integrity of other stable
states.]{.underline} The unstable [nuclear regimes in [**North Korea**
and **Iran** present that existential]{.mark} nuclear
[threat]{.mark}]{.underline} to the U.S.
[[described]{.underline}]{.mark} by Masco, [[but the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is in **no
rush to invade** ]{.mark}**these countries**]{.underline}. According to
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} anticipatory and preemptive logic Masco
prescribes to the United States, it could have already invaded those
states to prevent the disaster. Another limitation of his
[[arg]{.mark}ument]{.underline} is that he [[paints]{.underline}]{.mark}
the nuclear and [[counterterror]{.mark}]{.underline} states [[as
consistent]{.underline} [through all]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[presidencies]{.underline},]{.mark} thus, [drawing all administrations
under **a common denominator**. [Under Obama, the]{.mark}]{.underline}
counterterror state became a liberal democracy again. The
'[[unrestrained' theater]{.underline}]{.mark} [of operation]{.underline}
[has [shrunk]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[by]{.mark} ending the presence in
Iraq and [withdrawing from Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark}
[even though our presence there **could have been extended based on the
preemption logic**.]{.underline} [Obama recognized the faults
of]{.underline} the [Bush]{.underline} administration in acting
unilaterally, scaled back stability operations, and emphasized sharing
the costs and responsibilities of global leadership. The emergence of
the real ISIL threat undermines the book's core argument of threat
amplification, the U.S. preemption logic of response, and unconstrained
global reach. The U.S.-led global effort against ISIL amounts to more
than 50 nations, which shows the unified nature of the fight. Masco
asserts that U.S. superpower depends on the ability of the state to
monopolize a discourse of danger, but he doesn't discuss how the United
States succeeded in doing that. Masco could have developed his argument
by tracing how the United States was able to use its soft power to
mobilize like-minded states to agree with U.S. hegemony on WOT. It will
be interesting to trace the U.S. internalization of fear and terror. He
could have examined how allies responded to U.S. domestic mobilization
of its population and whether other states imitated U.S. emotional
management projects to mobilize their own populations. This would boost
his argument that the U.S. was able to project its power on the global
scale. In Theatre of Operations, Masco makes a compelling argument about
the creation of the unrestrained theater of operations via domestication
of fear and terror carried over from the Cold War days. His
anthropological study reveals the extent to which a democracy is willing
to use fear to assure the core principle of the social contract, defined
by Hobbes as the exchange of public obedience for collective security. A
democracy that chooses to be preoccupied with security risks to forgo
core democratic values resulting in the lack of transparency,
restriction of free flow of information, and negligence of non-military
threats---no less threatening than nuclear terrorism. Making [criticism
of U.S. actions]{.underline} the main focus of the book, however,
Masco's interpretations [are not properly balanced and]{.underline}
sometimes [appear biased.]{.underline} Still, reading Masco's insight of
the purpose of U.S. actions in the post-9/11 context offers
opportunities to think critically about the effects of 9/11 emotional
reprogramming of society and state of emergencies in U.S. history.

worse than (1), and (3) would be worse than (2). Which is the greater of
these two differences? [Most people believe that the greater difference
is between (1) and (2).]{.underline} [I believe that [the difference
between (2) and (3) is]{.mark} very [much greater]{.mark}]{.underline}.
\... [The Earth will remain habitable for **at least another billion
years**.]{.underline} [Civilization began only a few thousand years
ago.]{.underline} [[If we do not destroy mankind, these]{.mark} few
thousand [years may be]{.mark} only [**a tiny fraction** of the whole of
civilized]{.mark} human [history]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The difference
between (2) and (3) may thus be the difference between this tiny
fraction and all of the rest of this history.]{.underline} [If we
compare this possible history to a day, what has occurred so far is only
a **fraction of a second**.65]{.underline} In this argument, it seems
that Parfit is assuming that the survivors of a nuclear war that kills
99% of the population would eventually be able to recover civilisation
without long-term effect. As we have seen, this may not be a safe
assumption -- but for the purposes of this thought experiment, the point
stands. [What makes [existential catastrophes]{.mark} especially bad is
that they [would "**destroy the future**,"]{.mark} as]{.underline}
another Oxford philosopher, Nick [Bostrom, puts it.]{.underline}66
[[This future could]{.mark} potentially [be]{.mark} extremely
[long]{.mark} and full of [flourishing, and]{.mark} would therefore
[have]{.mark} extremely [large value]{.mark}.]{.underline} In standard
risk analysis, when working out how to respond to risk, we work out the
expected value of risk reduction, by weighing the probability that an
action will prevent an adverse event against the severity of the event.
[Because the value of preventing existential catastrophe is so vast,
even a tiny probability of prevention has huge expected
value.]{.underline}67 Of course, there is persisting reasonable
disagreement about ethics and there are a number of ways one might
resist this conclusion.68 Therefore, it would be unjustified to be
overconfident in Parfit and Bostrom's argument. [In some areas,
government policy does give significant weight to future
generations.]{.underline} For example, in assessing the risks of nuclear
waste storage, governments have considered timeframes of thousands,
hundreds of thousands, and even a million years.69 Justifications for
this policy usually appeal to principles of intergenerational equity
according to which future generations ought to get as much protection as
current generations.70 Similarly, widely accepted norms of sustainable
development require development that meets the needs of the current
generation without compromising the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs.71 [However, when it comes to existential risk, it
would seem that we fail to live up to principles of intergenerational
equity.]{.underline} [Existential catastrophe would not only give future
generations less than the current generations; **it would give them
nothing**.]{.underline} Indeed, [reducing existential risk plausibly has
a quite low cost for us in comparison with the huge expected value it
has for future generations.]{.underline} In spite of this, relatively
little is done to reduce existential risk. [Unless we give up on norms
of intergenerational equity, they give us a strong case for
significantly increasing our efforts to reduce existential
risks.]{.underline} 1.3. WHY EXISTENTIAL RISKS MAY BE SYSTEMATICALLY
UNDERINVESTED IN, AND THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY [In spite
of the importance of [existential risk]{.mark} reduction, it probably
[receives less attention than]{.mark} is
[warranted]{.mark}.]{.underline} As a result, concerted international
cooperation is required if we are to receive adequate protection from
existential risks. 1.3.1. Why existential risks are likely to be
underinvested in [There are several reasons why existential risk
reduction is likely to be underinvested in.]{.underline} [Firstly, [it
is a global public]{.mark} good.]{.underline} [Economic theory predicts
that such goods tend to be underprovided.]{.underline} [The benefits of
existential risk reduction are widely and indivisibly dispersed around
the globe from the countries responsible for taking action.]{.underline}
Consequently, a country which reduces existential risk gains only a
small portion of the benefits but bears the full brunt of the costs.
Countries thus have strong incentives to free ride, receiving the
benefits of risk reduction without contributing. As a result, too few do
what is in the common interest. [Secondly]{.underline}, as already
suggested above, [existential risk reduction is an
[intergenerational]{.mark} public [good]{.mark}: most of the benefits
are enjoyed by future generations who have no say in the political
process.]{.underline} [For these goods, the problem is temporal free
riding: the current generation enjoys the benefits of inaction while
future generations bear the costs. Thirdly]{.underline}, many
[existential risks]{.underline}, such as machine superintelligence,
engineered pandemics, and solar geoengineering, [pose an unprecedented
and uncertain future threat.]{.underline} Consequently, it is hard to
develop a satisfactory governance regime for them: there are few
existing governance instruments which can be applied to these risks, and
it is unclear what shape new instruments should take. In this way, our
position with regard to these emerging risks is comparable to the one we
faced when nuclear weapons first became available. [[Cognitive
biases]{.mark} also [lead people to underestimate]{.mark} existential
[risks]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Since [there have not been any
catastrophes of this magnitude]{.mark}, these risks are not salient to
politicians and the public.]{.underline}72 This is an example of the
misapplication of the availability heuristic, a mental shortcut which
assumes that something is important only if it can be readily recalled.
[[Another]{.mark} cognitive bias affecting perceptions of existential
risk [is scope neglect]{.mark}.]{.underline} In a seminal 1992 study,
three groups were asked how much they would be willing to pay to save
2,000, 20,000 or 200,000 birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The
groups answered \$80, \$78, and \$88, respectively.73 In this case, the
size of the benefits had little effect on the scale of the preferred
response. [People become numbed to the effect of saving lives when the
numbers get too large.]{.underline} 74 [Scope neglect is a particularly
acute problem for existential risk because the numbers at stake are so
large.]{.underline} [Due to scope neglect, decision-makers are prone to
treat existential risks in a similar way to problems which are less
severe by many orders of magnitude.]{.underline} A wide range of other
cognitive biases are likely to affect the evaluation of existential
risks.75

**Predictions of high-magnitude impacts are accurate and valuable.**

**Gleditsch 12** (Kristian S. Gleditsch, Department of Government,
University of Essex & Peace Research Institute Oslo, and Michael D.
Ward, Department of Political Science, Duke, 2012, "Forecasting is
difficult, especially about the future: Using contentious issues to
forecast interstate disputes," Journal of Peace Research, 50(1) 17--31,
Sage Journals)\
[There have been **remarkably few efforts** to generate]{.underline}
global [forecasts or risk profiles for interstate conflict]{.underline}.
Moreover, the most prominent efforts to consider the predictive ability
of models of interstate conflicts have based their research on models
that were not actually proposed with forecasting in mind. A notable
example here is Beck, King & Zeng (2000), who essentially adopt the
so-called liberal peace model of Russett & Oneal (2001). Certainly,
nothing akin to the Political Instability Task Force's now annual
projections (beginning with Gurr, Marshall & Khosla, 2000) exists for
international conflicts. Perhaps not surprisingly, [[many observers
are]{.mark} **very [skeptical]{.mark}** [of the ability]{.mark}
of]{.underline} academic [researchers [to anticipate conflict]{.mark}
between states]{.underline}, at least beyond very short time horizons.
Research in recent decades has seen a large number of hypotheses
generated to explain under what conditions militarized interstate
conflict is more or less likely. This avenue of research has been
primarily inspired by research on the so-called democratic peace, or the
absence of conflict between democracies. Indeed, there are thousands of
[scholarly works mentioning the term militarized interstate
dispute]{.underline} (MID), most of which [use these data for some kind
of empirical examination of a proposition about disputes]{.underline}.
Yet, the evidence suggests that [the ability of this body of work to
forecast conflict out-of-sample is **decidedly
disappointing**]{.underline}. Ward, Siverson & Cao (2007) found that
[most of the recent statistical studies]{.underline} of militarized
interstate disputes in prominent political science and international
relations journals [were unable to predict the outbreak of a single
dispute out-of-sample]{.underline} (see also Beck, King & Zeng, 2000).
Many researchers have sought to improve on the ability to forecast
militarized interstate conflict by turning to alternative statistical
methods. Beck, King & Zeng (2000), for example, find that neural
networks perform marginally better than generalized linear regression
models in forecasting conflict from the same input factors.1 Changes in
estimation methods or statistical techniques per se, however, have at
best led only to limited improvements in out-of-sample predictive
ability. Our argument is that **[[simply identifying inappropriate
methods]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as the key source of the problem in
forecasting conflict may [give]{.mark} us [the **wrong
diagnosis**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and lead us down less productive
avenues]{.underline}. A more fundamental problem is models that provide
a poor basis for forecasting by disregarding the motives for conflict to
arise, or by only considering motives in a relatively superficial
manner. [Models that have been proposed for research on the democratic
peace]{.underline}, notably the work of Russett & Oneal (2001), [are
primarily intended to examine whether certain characteristics of liberal
institutions]{.underline}, such as democracy and trade, [make conflict
on average less likely]{.underline} relative to baseline risks of
conflict. Although [these approaches]{.underline} may be appropriate for
testing the original propositions of interest, they essentially [ignore
the **contentious issues** that might cause states to resort to
violence]{.underline} and instead treat these contentious issues as
exogenous features, typically hidden inside a so-called 'black box' of
the baseline risk of conflict. Our own initial foray into out-of-sample
prediction for a state-level model indicates that spatial information
about other conflict events can help to improve forecasts (see Ward &
Gleditsch, 2002). Although this allows predictions of conflict to be
conditional on other observed events rather than treating each conflict
as an independent observation, the approach still ignores the issues
over which such conflicts may have arisen initially. We believe that
[greater [attention to the **specific reasons for**]{.mark} **the
occurrence of [conflicts]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the
[incompatibilities]{.mark} that may generate the use of violence can
help **[improve our ability to forecast conflict]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Although we recognize that different models may be appropriate to
evaluate particular propositions and to forecast events, in our view
[**the enterprise of [prediction has great potential]{.mark}** [for
winnowing bad ideas out of theories]{.mark} on the causes of conflict
[and avoiding]{.mark} the problem of [retrospective
biases]{.mark}]{.underline} in conventional hypothesis testing on the
data used to develop the hypotheses in the first place (see Ward,
Greenhill & Bakke, 2010). In fairness, [much of the existing work on the
statistical modeling of conflict has bypassed motivation]{.underline}
since it is genuinely difficult to establish what states fight over and
what their possible motivation for fighting might be. Nevertheless,
**[[the fact that something is difficult to evaluate does not
mean]{.mark} that simply [ignoring it is]{.mark} the [best]{.mark}
course of action]{.underline}**. Another tradition in research on
conflict has sought to identify incompatibilities in terms of
contentious issues, such as territorial or maritime claims (Diehl, 1992;
Mansbach & Vasquez, 1981). Recent efforts to examine these propositions
empirically have found considerable evidence that cases where such
claims exist are more likely to see militarized activities (Hensel,
2001; Hensel et al., 2008; Hensel & Mitchell, 2010). Even so, at present
this line of research has primarily engaged in testing hypotheses about
whether coefficient estimates are significantly different from 0 or the
in-sample post-diction of conflicts, and has not yet examined if
information on contentious issues may be helpful for forecasting dyadic
conflict out-of-sample. Here we explicitly consider whether [taking into
account information on contentious issues and conflict management
can]{.underline} help [improve on forecasting interstate conflict
and]{.underline} our understanding of [conflict dynamics]{.underline}.
Although we focus on statistical approaches to interstate conflict in
this article, [many of our arguments also apply to problems in
traditional theories of conflict and qualitative approaches to
prediction or anticipating political events]{.underline} (see Tetlock,
2005). [Traditional theories of interstate conflict tend to focus on
**structural features** presumed to influence the opportunities for
conflict such as the distribution of power]{.underline} in the
international system or relative balance of power (see e.g. Waltz,
1979). These theories display little interest in the specific
incompatibilities that may motivate the use of violence. However,
structural factors rarely change rapidly, but [violent conflict tends to
be episodic, and]{.underline} hence [cannot be adequately explained
merely by reference to permissive conditions]{.underline} (see Fearon,
1995). Likewise, our core argument applies to studies of civil war,
which tend to emphasize opportunities for conflict rather than
motivations for conflict (see Cederman, Weidmann & Gleditsch, 2011), and
where evidence for the predictive ability of existing statistical
efforts seems similarly disappointing (see Ward, Greenhill & Bakke,
2010). Many political and area study experts, typically using informal
methods for deriving predictions, often have strong confidence in their
ability to forecast events. However, the comprehensive series of studies
by Tetlock (2005), who asked experts to rate a series of outcomes which
could then be compared against the historical record, provide little
support for the forecasting ability of political experts.

2\. Risks with infinite impact: A new category of risks "Most risk
management is really just advanced contingency planning and disciplining
yourself to realise that, [given enough time, very **low probability
events not only can happen, but they absolutely will
happen**]{.underline}." Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs CEO, July 2013 1
[**[Risk = Probability × Impact]{.mark}** [Impacts where civilisation
collapses to]{.mark} a state of [**great suffering** and **do not
recover**]{.mark}, or a situation where all human life end, [are]{.mark}
defined as [**infinite** as the result is **irreversible**]{.mark} and
**lasts forever**]{.underline}. A new group of global risks This is a
report about [a limited number of global risks -- that can be identified
through a scientific and transparent process -- with impacts of a
magnitude that pose a threat to human civilisation, or even possibly to
all human life]{.underline}. With such a focus it may surprise some
readers to find that the report's essential aim is to inspire action and
dialogue as well as an increased use of the methodologies used for risk
assessment. The real focus is not on the almost unimaginable impacts of
the risks the report outlines. Its fundamental purpose is to encourage
global collaboration and to use this new category of risk as a driver
for innovation. [The idea that we face a number of global challenges
threatening the very basis of our civilisation at the beginning of the
21st century is well accepted in the scientific community]{.underline},
and is studied at a number of leading universities.2 But there is still
no coordinated approach to address this group of challenges and turn
them into opportunities for a new generation of global cooperation and
the creation of a global governance system capable of addressing the
greatest challenges of our time. [This]{.underline} report has, to the
best of our knowledge, [created the first science-based list of global
risks with a potentially infinite impact]{.underline} and has made the
first attempt to provide an initial overview of the uncertainties
related to these risks as well as rough quantifications for the
probabilities of these impacts. What is risk? Risk is the potential of
losing something of value, weighed against the potential to gain
something of value. Every day we make different kinds of risk
assessments, in more or less rational ways, when we weigh different
options against each other. The basic idea of risk is that an
[uncertainty exists regarding the outcome and that we must find a way to
take the best possible decision based on our understanding of this
uncertainty]{.underline}.3 To calculate risk the probability of an
outcome is often multiplied by the impact. The impact is in most cases
measured in economic terms, but it can also be measured in anything we
want to avoid, such as suffering. At the heart of a risk assessment is a
probability distribution, often described by a probability density
function4; see figure X for a graphic illustration. The slightly tilted
bell curve is a common probability distribution, but the shape differs
and in reality is seldom as smooth as the example. The total area under
the curve always represents 100 percent, i.e. all the possible outcomes
fit under the curve. In this case (A) represents the most probable
impact. With a much lower probability it will be a close to zero impact,
illustrated by (B). In the same way as in case B there is also a low
probability that the situation will be very significant, illustrated by
(C). Figure 1: Probability density function \[FIGURE 1 OMITTED\] [The
impacts (A), (B) and (C) all belong to the same category,]{.underline}
~~normal~~ [\[common\] impacts: the impacts may be more or less serious,
but they can be dealt with within the current system]{.underline}. [The
impacts in this report are however of a special kind. These are impacts
where everything will be lost and the situation will not be reversible,
i.e challenges with potentially infinite impact]{.underline}. In
insurance and finance this kind of risk is called "risk of ruin", an
impact where all capital is lost.5 This impact is however only infinite
for the company that is losing the money. From society's perspective,
that is not a special category of risk. In this report the focus is on
the "risk of ruin" on a global scale and on a human level, [in the worst
case this is when we risk the extinction of our own
species]{.underline}. [On a probability curve the impacts in this report
are usually at the very far right with a relatively low probability
compared with other impacts]{.underline}, illustrated by (D) in Figure
2. Often they are so far out on the tail of the curve that they are not
even included in studies. [For each risk in this report the probability
of an infinite impact is very low compared to the most likely
outcome]{.underline}. Some studies even indicate that not all risks in
this report can result in an infinite impact. [But a significant number
of [**peer-reviewed** reports indicate]{.mark} that [those]{.mark}
impacts **not only [can happen]{.mark}**, but that [their **probability
is increasing** due to **unsustainable trends**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The assumption for this report is that by creating a better
understanding of our scientific knowledge regarding risks with a
potentially infinite impact, we can inspire initiatives that can turn
these risks into drivers for innovation. [Not only could a better
understanding of the unique magnitude of these risks help address the
risks we face, it could also help to create a path towards more
sustainable development]{.underline}. The group of global risks
discussed in this report are so different from most of the challenges we
face that they are hard to comprehend. But that is also why they can
help us to build the collaboration we need and drive the development of
further solutions that benefit both people and the planet. As noted
above, none of the risks in this report is likely to result directly in
an infinite impact, and some are probably even physically incapable of
doing so. But all are so significant that they could reach a threshold
impact able to create social and ecological instability that could
trigger a process which could lead to an infinite impact. For several
reasons the potentially infinite impacts of the risks in this report are
not as well known as they should be. One reason is [the way that extreme
impacts are often masked by most of the theories and models used by
governments and business today]{.underline}. For example, the
probability of extreme impacts is often below what is included in
studies and strategies. [The [tendency to exclude impacts below a
probability of five percent is]{.mark} one [reason for the]{.mark}
**relative ["invisibility"]{.mark}** [of **infinite impacts**]{.mark}.
The almost standard use of a 95% confidence interval is one reason why
low-probability high-impact events are often ignored]{.underline}.6
Figure 2: Probability density function with tail highlighted \[FIGURE 2
OMITTED\] Climate change is a good example, where almost all of the
focus is on the most likely scenarios and there are few studies that
include the low-probability high-impact scenarios. In most reports about
climate impacts, the impacts caused by warming beyond five or six
degrees Celsius are even omitted from tables and graphs even though the
IPCC's own research indicates that the probability of these impacts are
often between one and five percent, and sometimes even higher.7 Other
aspects that contribute to this relative invisibility include the fact
that extreme impacts are difficult to translate into monetary terms,
they have a global scope, and they often require a time-horizon of a
century or more. They cannot be understood simply by linear
extrapolation of current trends, and they lack historical precedents.
There is also the fact that the measures required to significantly
reduce the probability of infinite impacts will be radical compared to a
business-as-usual scenario with a focus on incremental changes. The
exact probability of a specific impact is difficult or impossible to
estimate.8 However, the important thing is to establish the current
magnitude of the probabilities and compare them with the probabilities
for such impacts we cannot accept. [A failure to provide any estimate
for these risks often results in strategies and priorities defined as
though the probability of a totally unacceptable outcome is
zero]{.underline}. An approximate number for a best estimate also makes
it easier to understand that a great uncertainty means the actual
probability can be both much higher and much lower than the best
estimate. It should also be stressed that [uncertainty is not a weakness
in science; it always exists in scientific work. It is a systematic way
of understanding the limitations of the methodology, data,
etc]{.underline}.9 [Uncertainty is not a reason to wait to take action
if the impacts are serious]{.underline}. Increased uncertainty is
something that risk experts, e.g. insurance experts and security policy
experts, interpret as a signal for action. [A contrasting challenge is
that our [cultural references to]{.mark} the threat of [infinite impacts
have been dominated]{.mark} throughout history [by]{.mark} religious
[groups seeking to scare society without]{.mark} any [scientific
backing]{.mark}, often as a way [to **discipline people**]{.mark} and
implement unpopular measures. It should not have to be said, but
[this]{.mark} report [is]{.mark} obviously [**fundamentally different**
as it focuses on **scientific evidence** from **peer-reviewed
sources**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Infinite impact The concept infinite
impact refers to two aspects in particular; the terminology is not meant
to imply a literally infinite impact (with all the mathematical
subtleties that would imply) but to serve as a reminder that these risks
are of a different nature. Ethical [These are [impacts]{.mark} that
[threaten the]{.mark} very **[survival of humanity and life on
Earth]{.mark}** -- and therefore can be seen as being infinitely
negative [from an **ethical perspective**]{.mark}. **[No positive gain
can outweigh even a small probability]{.mark}** for an infinite negative
impact. Such risks require society to ensure that we eliminate these
risks by reducing the impact below an infinite impact as a **top
priority**, or at least do everything we can to reduce the probability
of these risks]{.underline}. As some of these risks are impossible to
eliminate today it is also important to discuss what probability can
right now be accepted for risks with a possible infinite impact.
Economic Infinite impacts are beyond what most traditional economic
models today are able to cope with. [The impacts are irreversible in the
most fundamental way, so tools like cost-benefit assessment seldom make
sense]{.underline}. To use discounting that makes infinite impacts
(which could take place 100 years or more from now and affect all future
generations) close to invisible in economic assessments, is another
example of a challenge with current tools. So while tools like
cost-benefit models and discounting can help us in some areas, they are
seldom applicable in the context of infinite impacts. New tools are
needed to guide the global economy in an age of potential infinite
impacts. See chapter 2.2.2 for a more detailed iscussion. Roulette and
Russian roulette When probability and normal risks are discussed the
example of a casino and roulette is often used. You bet something, then
spin the wheel and with a certain probability you win or lose. You can
use different odds to discuss different kinds of risk taking. These
kinds of thought experiment can be very useful, but when it comes to
infinite risks these gaming analogies become problematic. For infinite
impact a more appropriate analogy is probably Russian roulette. But
instead of "normal" Russian roulette where you only bet your own life
you are now also betting everyone you know and everyone you don't know.
Everyone alive will die if you lose. There will be no second chance for
anyone as there will be no future generations; humanity will end with
your loss. What probability would you accept for different sums of money
if you played this version of Russian roulette? Most people would say
that it is stupid and -- no matter how low the probability is and no
matter how big the potential win is -- this kind of game should not be
played, as it is unethical. Many would also say that no person should be
allowed to make such a judgment, as those who are affected do not have a
say. You could add that most of those who will lose from it cannot say
anything as they are not born and will never exist if you lose. The
difference between ordinary roulette and "allhumanity Russian roulette"
is one way of illustrating the difference in nature between a "normal"
risk that is reversible, and a risk with an infinite impact. [An
additional challenge in acknowledging the risks outlined in this report
is that [many]{.mark} of the [traditional risks including wars]{.mark}
and violence [have decreased]{.mark}, even though it might not always
looks that way in media]{.underline}.10 [So a significant number of
experts today spend a substantial amount of time trying to explain that
much of what is discussed as dangerous trends might not be as dangerous
as we think]{.underline}. For policy makers listening only to experts in
traditional risk areas [it is therefore easy to get the impression that
global risks are becoming less of a problem]{.underline}. [The **chain
of events** that could result in **infinite impacts** in this report
also **differ** from most of the traditional risks, as most of them are
**not** triggered by **wilful acts**, but
**accidents**/mistakes]{.underline}. Even the probabilities related to
nuclear war in this report are to a large degree related to inadvertent
escalation. As many of the tools to analyse and address risks have been
developed to protect nations and states from attacks, [risks involving
accidents tend to get less attention]{.underline}. This report
emphasises the need for an open and democratic process in addressing
global challenges with potentially infinite impact. Hence, this is a
scientifically based invitation to discuss how we as a global community
can address what could be considered the greatest challenges of our
time. The difficulty for individual scientists to communicate a
scientific risk approach should however not be underestimated.
[Scientists who today talk about low-probability impacts, that are
serious but still far from infinite, are often accused of pessimism and
scaremongering, even if they do nothing but highlight scientific
findings]{.underline}.11 To highlight infinite impacts with even lower
probability can therefore be something that a scientist who cares about
his/her reputation would want to avoid. In the media it is still common
to contrast the most probable climate impact with the probability that
nothing, or almost nothing, will happen. The fact that almost nothing
could happen is not wrong in most cases, but it is unscientific and
dangerous if different levels of probability are presented as equal. The
tendency to compare the most probable climate impact with the
possibility of a low or no impact also [results in a situation where
low-probability high-impact outcomes are often totally ignored. An
honest and scientific approach is to, whenever possible, present the
whole probability distribution and pay special attention to unacceptable
outcomes]{.underline}. [The fact that we have challenges that with some
probability might be infinite and therefore fundamentally irreversible
is difficult to comprehend, and **[physiologically]{.mark}** they are
something our [brains are poorly equipped to respond]{.mark} to,
according to evolutionary psychologists]{.underline}.12 It is hard for
us as individuals to grasp that humanity for the first time in its
history now has the capacity to create such catastrophic outcomes.
Professor Marianne Frankenhaeuser, former head of the psychology
division, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, put it this way: "Part of the
answer is to be found in psychological defence mechanisms. The nuclear
threat is collectively denied, because to face it would force us to face
some aspects of the world's situation which we do not want to
recognise." 13 [This [**psychological** denial]{.mark} may be one reason
why there is a tendency among some stakeholders to confuse "being
optimistic" with denying what science is telling us, and [ignoring parts
of the probability curve]{.mark}]{.underline}.14 Ignoring the fact that
there is strong scientific evidence for serious impacts in different
areas, and focusing only on selected sources which suggest that the
problem may not be so serious, is not optimistic. It is both
unscientific and dangerous.15 [A scientific approach requires us to base
our decisions on the whole probability distribution]{.underline}.
Whether it is possible to address the challenge or not is the area where
optimism and pessimism can make people look at the same set of data and
come to different conclusions. Two things are important to keep in mind:
first, that there is always a probability distribution when it comes to
risk; second, that there are two different kinds of impacts that are of
interest for this report. The probability distribution can have
different shapes but in simplified cases the shape tends to look like a
slightly modified clock (remember figure 1). In the media it can sound
as though experts argue whether an impact, for example a climate impact
or a pandemic, will be dangerous or not. But what serious experts
discuss is the probability of different oucomes. They can disagree on
the shape of the curve or what curves should be studied, but not that a
probability curve exists. With climate change this includes discussions
about how sensitive the climate is, how much greenhouse gas will be
emitted, and what impacts that different warmings will result in. Just
as it is important not to ignore challenges with potentially infinite
impacts, it is also important not to use them to scare people. Dramatic
images and strong language are best avoided whenever possible, as this
group of risks require sophisticated strategies that benefit from
rational arguments. Throughout history we have seen too many examples
when threats of danger have been damagingly used to undermine important
values. The history of infinite impacts: The LA-602 document The
understanding of infinite impacts is very recent compared with most of
our institutions and laws. It is only 70 years ago that Edward Teller,
one of the greatest physicists of his time, with his
back-of-the-envelope calculations, produced results that differed
drastically from all that had gone before. His calculations indicated
that the explosion of a nuclear bomb -- a creation of some of the
brightest minds on the planet, including Teller himself -- could result
in a chain reaction so powerful that it would ignite the world's
atmosphere, thereby ending human life on Earth.16 Robert Oppenheimer,
who led the Manhattan Project to develop the nuclear bomb, halted the
project to see whether Teller's calculations were correct.17 The
resulting document, LA- 602: Ignition of the Atmosphere with Nuclear
Bombs, concluded that Teller was wrong, But the sheer complexity drove
them to end their assessment by writing that "further work on the
subject \[is\] highly desirable".18 The LA-602 document can be seen as
the first scientific global risk report addressing a category of risks
where the worst possible impact in all practical senses is infinite.19
Since the atomic bomb more challenges have emerged with potentially
infinite impact. Allmost all of these new challenges are linked to the
increased knowledge, economic and technical development that has brought
so many benefits. For example, climate change is the result of the
industrial revolution and development that was, and still is, based
heavily on fossil fuel. The increased potential for global pandemics is
the result of an integrated global economy where goods and services move
quickly around the world, combined with rapid urbanisation and high
population density. In parallel with the increased number of risks with
possible infinite impact, our capacity to analyse and solve them has
greatly increased too. Science and technology today provides us with
knowledge and tools that can radically reduce the risks that
historically have been behind major extinctions, such as pandemics and
asteroids. Recent challenges like climate change, and emerging
challenges like synthetic biology and nanotechnology, can to a large
degree be addressed by smart use of new technologies, new lifestyles and
institutional structures. It will be hard as it will require
collaboration of a kind that we have not seen before. It will also
require us to create systems that can deal with the problems before they
occur. The fact that the same knowledge and tools can be both a problem
and a solution is important to understand in order to avoid
polarisation. Within a few decades, or even sooner, many of the tools
that can help us solve the global challenges of today will come from
fields likely to provide us with the most powerful instruments we have
ever had -- resulting in their own sets of challenges. Synthetic
biology, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence (AI) are all rapidly
evolving fields with great potential. They may help solve many of
today's main challenges or, if not guided in a benign direction, may
result in catastrophic outcomes. The point of departure of this report
is the fact that we now have the knowledge, economic resources and
technological ability to reduce most of the greatest risks of our time.
Conversely, the infinite impacts we face are almost all unintended
results of human ingenuity. The reason we are in this situation is that
we have made progress in many areas without addressing unintended
low-probability high-impact consequences. Creating innovative and
resilient systems rather than simply managing risk would let us focus
more on opportunities. But the resilience needed require moving away
from legacy systems is likely to be disruptive, so an open and
transparent discussion is needed regarding the transformative solutions
required. Figure 3: Probability density function with tail and threshold
highlighted \[FIGURE 3 OMITTED\] 2.1 Report structure The first part of
the report is an introduction where the global risks with potential
infinite impact are introduced and defined. This part also includes the
methodology for selecting these risks, and presents the twelve risks
that meet this definition. Four goals of the report are also presented,
under the headings "acknowledge", "inspire", "connect" and "deliver".
The second part is an overview of the twelve global risks and key events
that illustrate some of the work around the world to address them. For
each challenge five important factors that influence the probability or
impact are also listed. The risks are divided into four different
categories depending on their characteristics. "Current challenges" is
the first category and includes the risks that currently threaten
humanity due to our economic and technological development - extreme
climate change, for example, which depends on how much greenhouse gas we
emit. "Exogenic challenges" includes risks where the basic probability
of an event is beyond human control, but where the probability and
magnitude of the impact can be influenced - asteroid impacts, for
example, where the asteroids' paths are beyond human control but an
impact can be moderated by either changing the direction of the asteroid
or preparing for an impact. "Emerging challenges" includes areas where
technological development and scientific assessment indicate that they
could both be a very important contribution to human welfare and help
reduce the risks associated with current challenges, but could also
result in new infinite impacts.20 AI, nanotechnology and synthetic
biology are examples. "Global policy challenge" is a different kind of
risk. It is a probable threat arising from future global governance as
it resorts to destructive policies, possibly in response to the other
challenges listed above. The third part of the report discusses the
relationship between the different risks. Action to reduce one risk can
increase another, unless their possible links are understood. Many
solutions are also able to address multiple risks, so there are
significant benefits from understanding how one relates to others.
Investigating these correlations could be a start, but correlation is a
linear measure and non-linear techniques may be more helpful for
assessing the aggregate risk. The fourth part is an overview, the first
ever to our knowledge, of the uncertainties and probabilities of global
risks with potentially infinite impacts. The numbers are only rough
estimates and are meant to be a first step in a dialogue where
methodologies are developed and estimates refined. The fifth part
presents some of the most important underlying trends that influence the
global challenges, which often build up slowly until they reach a
threshold and very rapid changes ensue. The sixth and final part
presents an overview of possible ways forward. 2.2 Goals Goal 1:
Acknowledge That key stakeholders, influencing global challenges,
acknowledge the existence of the category of risks that could result in
infinite impact. They should also recognice that the list of risks that
belong to this category should be revised as new technologies are
developed and our knowledge increases. Regardless of the risks included,
the category should be given special attention in all processes and
decisions of relevance. The report also seeks to demonstrate to all key
stakeholders that we have the capacity to reduce, or even eliminate,
most of the risks in this category. Establish a category of risks with
potentially infinite impact. Before anything significant can happen
regarding global risks with potentially infinite impacts, their
existence must be acknowledged. Rapid technological development and
economic growth have delivered unprecedented material welfare to
billions of people in a veritable tide of utopias.21 But we now face the
possibility that even tools created with the best of intentions can have
a darker side too, a side that may threaten human civilisation, and
conceivably the continuation of human life. This is what all
decision-makers need to recognise. Rather than succumbing to terror, we
need to acknowledge that we can let the prospect inspire and drive us
forward. Goal 2: Inspire That policy makers inspire action by explaining
how the probabilities and impacts can be reduced and turned into
opportunities. Concrete examples of initiatives should be communicated
in different networks in order to create ripple effects, with the
long-term goal that all key stakeholders should be inspired to turn
these risks into opportunities for positive action. Show concrete action
that is taking place today. This report seeks to show that it is not
only possible to contribute to reducing these risks, but that it is
perhaps the most important thing anyone can spend their time on. It does
so by combining information about the risks with information about
individuals and groups who has made a significant contribution by
turning challenges into opportunities. By highlighting concrete examples
the report hopes to inspire a new generation of leaders. Goal 3: Connect
That leaders in different sectors connect with each other to encourage
collaboration. A specific focus on financial and security policy where
significant risks combine to demand action beyond the incremental is
required. Support new meetings between interested stakeholders. The
nature of these risks spans countries and continents; they require
action by governments and politicians, but also by companies, academics,
NGOs, and many other groups. The magnitude of the possible impacts
requires not only leaders to act but above all new models for global
cooperation and decision-making to ensure delivery. The need for
political leadership is therefore crucial. Even with those risks where
many groups are involved, such as climate change and pandemics, very few
today address the possibility of infinite impact aspects. Even fewer
groups address the links between the different risks. There is also a
need to connect different levels of work, so that local, regional,
national and international efforts can support each other when it comes
to risks with potentially infinite impacts. Goal 4: Deliver That
concrete strategies are developed that allow key stakeholders to
identify, quantify and address global challenges as well as gather
support for concrete steps towards a wellfunctioning global governance
system. This would include tools and initiatives that can help identify,
quantify and reduce risks with potentially infinite impacts. Identify
and implement strategies and initiatives. Reports can acknowledge,
inspire and connect, but only people can deliver actual results. The
main focus of the report is to show that actual initiatives need to be
taken that deliver actual results. Only when the probability of an
infinite impact becomes acceptably low, very close to zero, and/or when
the maximum impact is significantly reduced, should we talk about real
progress. In order to deliver results it is important to remember that
global governance to tackle these risks is the way we organise society
in order to address our greatest challenges. It is not a question of
establishing a "world government", it is about the way we organise
ourselves on all levels, from the local to the global. The report is a
first step and should be seen as an invitation to all responsible
parties that can affect the probability and impact of risks with
potentially infinite impacts. But its success will ultimately be
measured only on how it contributes to concrete results. 2.3 Global
challenges and infinite impact This chapter first introduces the concept
of infinite impact. It then describes the methodology used to identify
challenges with an infinite impact. It then presents risks with
potentially infinite impact that the methodology results in. 2.3.1
Definition of infinite impact The specific criterion for including a
risk in this report is that well-sourced science shows the challenge can
have the following consequences: 22 1. Infinite impact: When
civilisation collapses to a state of great suffering and does not
recover, or a situation where all human life ends. The existence of such
threats is well attested by science.23 2. Infinite impact threshold --
an impact that can trigger a chain of events that could result first in
a civilisation collapse, and then later result in an infinite impact.
Such thresholds are especially important to recognise in a complex and
interconnected society where resilience is decreasing.24 A collapse of
civilisation is defined as a drastic decrease in human population size
and political/economic/social complexity, globally for an extended
time.25 The above definition means the list of challenges is not static.
When new challenges emerge, or current ones fade away, the list will
change. An additional criterion for including risks in this report is
"human influence". Only risks where humans can influence either the
probability, the impact, or both, are included. For most risks both
impact and probability can be affected, for example with nuclear war,
where the number/size of weapons influences the impact and tensions
between countries affects the probability. Other risks, such as a
supervolcano, are included as it is possible to affect the impact
through various mitigation methods, even if we currently cannot affect
the probability. Risks that are susceptible to human influence are
indirectly linked, because efforts to address one of them may increase
or decrease the likelihood of another. 2.3.2 Why use "infinite impact"
as a concept? The concept of infinity was chosen as it reflects many of
the challenges, especially in economic theory, to addressing these risks
as well as the need to question much of our current way of thinking. The
concept of a category of risks based on their extreme impact is meant to
provide a tool to distinguish one particular kind of risk from others.
The benefit of this new concept should be assessed based on two things.
First, does the category exist, and second, is the concept helpful in
addressing these risks? [The report has found ample evidence that there
are risks with an impact that can end human civilisation and even all
human life]{.underline}. The report further concludes that a new
category of risk is not only meaningful but also timely. We live in a
society where [global risks with potentially infinite impacts increase
in both number and probability according to multiple
studies]{.underline}. Looking ahead, many emerging technologies which
will certainly provide beneficial results, might also result in an
increased probability of infinite impacts.26 Over the last few years a
greater understanding of low probability or unknown probability events
has helped more people to understand the importance of looking beyond
the most probable scenarios. Concepts like "black swans" and "perfect
storms" are now part of mainstream policy and business language.27
Greater understanding of the technology and science of complex systems
has also resulted in a new understanding of potentially disruptive
events. Humans now have such an impact on the planet that the term "the
anthropocene" is being used, even by mainstream media like The
Economist.28 The term was introduced in the 90s by the Nobel Prize
winner Paul Crutzen to describe how humans are now the dominant force
changing the Earth's ecosystems.29 The idea to establish a well defined
category of risks that focus on risks with a potentially infinite impact
that can be used as a practical tool by policy makers is partly inspired
by Nick Bostrom's philosophical work and his introduction of a risk
taxonomy that includes an academic category called "existential
risks".30 Introducing a category with risks that have a potentially
infinite impact is not meant to be a mathematical definition; infinity
is a thorny mathematical concept and nothing in reality can be
infinite.31 It is meant to illustrate a singularity, when humanity is
threatened, when many of the tools used to approach most challenges
today become problematic, meaningless, or even counterproductive. The
concept of an infinite impact highlights a unique situation where
humanity itself is threatened and the very idea of value and price
collapses from a human perspective, as the price of the last humans also
can be seen to be infinite. This is not to say that those traditional
tools cannot still be useful, but with infinite impacts we need to add
an additional set of analytical tools. Life Value The following
estimates have been applied to the value of life in the US. The
estimates are either for one year of additional life or for the
statistical value of a single life. -- \$50,000 per year of quality life
(international standard most private and government-run health insurance
plans worldwide use to determine whether to cover a new medical
procedure) -- \$129,000 per year of quality life (based on analysis of
kidney dialysis procedures by Stefanos Zenios and colleagues at Stanford
Graduate School of Business) -- \$7.4 million (Environmental Protection
Agency) -- \$7.9 million (Food and Drug Administration) -- \$6 million
(Transportation Department) -- \$28 million (Richard Posner based on the
willingness to pay for avoiding a plane crash) Source: Wikipedia: Value

Asked Questions on Mortality Risk Valuation

Posner, Richard A. Catastrophe: risk and response. Oxford University
Press, 2004 Some of the risks, including nuclear war, climate change and
pandemics, are often included in current risk overviews, but in many
cases their possible infinite impacts are excluded. The impacts which
are included are in most cases still very serious, but only the more
probable parts of the probability distributions are included, and the
last part of the long tail -- where the infinite impact is found -- is
excluded.32 Most risk reports do not differentiate between challenges
with a limited impact and those with a potential for infinite impact.
This is dangerous, as it can mean resources are spent in ways that
increase the probability of an infinite impact. Ethical aspects of
infinite impact [The basic ethical aspect of infinite impact is this: a
very small group alive today can take decisions that will fundamentally
affect all future generations]{.underline}. "All future generations" is
not a concept that is often discussed, and for good reason. All through
human history we have had no tools with a measurable global impact for
more than a few generations. Only in the last few decades has our
potential impact reached a level where all future generations can be
affected, for the simple reason that we now have the technological
capacity to end human civilisation. If we count human history from the
time when we began to practice settled agriculture, that gives us about
12,000 years.33 If we make a moderate assumption that humanity will live
for at least 50 million more years34 our 12,000-year history so far
represents 1/4200, or 0.024%, of our potential history. So our
generation has the option of risking everything and annulling 99.976% of
our potential history. Comparing 0.024% with the days of a person living
to 100 years from the day of conception, this would equal less than nine
days and is the first stage of human embryogenesis, the germinal
stage.35 Two additional arguments to treat potentially infinite impacts
as a separate category are: 36 1. [**[An approach]{.mark} to infinite
impacts [cannot be]{.mark} one of [trial-and-error]{.mark}**, because
there is no opportunity to learn from errors. The reactive approach --
see what happens, limit damage, and learn from experience -- is
unworkable. [Instead]{.mark} society [must]{.mark} be proactive. This
requires foresight to foresee new types of threat and willingness to
[take]{.mark} decisive [preventative action and]{.mark} to [bear the
costs (**moral** and economic)]{.mark} of such actions]{.underline}. 2.
We cannot necessarily rely on the institutions, morality, social
attitudes or national security policies that developed from our
experience of other sorts of risk. Infinite impacts are in a different
category. [Institutions and individuals may find it hard to take these
[risks]{.mark} seriously simply because they [lie outside our
experience]{.mark}. Our [collective fear-response will]{.mark} probably
[be ill-calibrated]{.mark} to the magnitude of threat]{.underline}.
Economic aspects of infinite impact and discounting In today's society a
monetary value is sometimes ascribed to human life. Some experts use
this method to estimate risk by assigning a monetary value to human
extinction.37 We have to remember that the monetary values placed on a
human life in most cases are not meant to suggest that we have actually
assigned a specific value to a life. Assigning a value to a human life
is a tool used in a society with a limited supply of resources or
infrastructure (ambulances, perhaps) or skills. In such a society it is
impossible to save every life, so some trade-off must be made.38 The US
Environmental Protection Agency explains its use like this: "The EPA
does not place a dollar value on individual lives. Rather, when
conducting a benefit-cost analysis of new environmental policies, the
Agency uses estimates of how much people are willing to pay for small
reductions in their risks of dying from adverse health conditions that
may be caused by environmental pollution." 39 The fact that monetary
values for human lives can help to define priorities when it comes to
smaller risks does not mean that they are suitable for quite different
uses. Applying a monetary value to the whole human race makes little
sense to most people, and from an economic perspective it makes no
sense. Money helps us to prioritise, but with no humans there would be
no economy and no need for priorities. Ignoring, or discounting, future
generations is actually the only way to avoid astronomical numbers for
impacts that may seriously affect every generation to come. In
Catastrophe: Risk and Response, Richard Posner provides a cost estimate,
based on the assumption that a human life is worth \$50,000, resulting
in a \$300 tn cost for the whole of humanity, assuming a population of
six billion. He then doubles the population number to include the value
of all future generations, ending up with \$600 tn, while acknowledging
that "without discounting, the present value of the benefits of
risk-avoidance measures would often approach infinity for the type of
catastrophic risk with which this book is concerned." 40 Discounting for
risks that include the possibility of an infinite impact differs from
risk discounting for less serious impacts. For example the Stern
Review41 prompted a discussion between its chief author, Nicholas Stern,
and William Nordhaus,42 each of whom argued for different discount
levels using different arguments. But neither discussed a possible
infinite climate impact. An overview of the discussion by David Evans of
Oxford Brookes University highlighted some of the differing
assumptions.43 [Two things make infinite impacts special from a
discounting perspective. First, there is no way that future generations
can compensate for the impact, as they will not exist. Second, the
impact is something that is beyond an individual preference, as society
will no longer exist]{.underline}. Discounting is undertaken to allocate
resources in the most productive way. In cases that do not include
infinite impacts, discounting "reflects the fact that there are many
high-yield investments that would improve the quality of life for future
generations. The discount rate should be set so that our investable
funds are devoted to the most productive uses." 44 When there is a
potentially infinite impact, the focus is no longer on what investments
have the best rate of return, it is about avoiding the ultimate end.
While many economists shy away from infinite impacts, those exploring
the potentially extreme impacts of global challenges often assume
infinite numbers to make their point. Nordhaus for example writes that
"the sum of undiscounted anxieties would be infinite (i.e. equal to 1 +
1 +1 + ... = ∞). In this situation, most of us would dissolve in a sea
of anxiety about all the things that could go wrong for distant
generations from asteroids, wars, out-of-control robots, fat tails,
smart dust and other disasters." 45 It is interesting that Nordhaus
himself provides very good graphs that show why the most important
factor when determining actions is a possible threshold (see below
Figure 4 and 5). Nordhaus was discussing climate change, but the role of
thresholds is similar for most infinite impacts. The first figure is
based on traditional economic approaches which assume that Nature has no
thresholds; the second graph illustrates what happens with the curve
when a threshold exists. As Nordhaus also notes, it is hard to establish
thresholds, but if they are significant all other assumptions become
secondary. The challenge that Nordhaus does not address, and which is
important especially with climate change, is that [[thresholds become
invisible]{.mark} in]{.underline} economic [calculations [if they occur
far in]{.mark}to [the future, even if]{.mark} it is **[current
actions]{.mark}** that [unbalance the system]{.mark} and eventually push
it over the threshold]{.underline}.46 Note that these dramatic
illustrations rest on assumptions that the thresholds are still
relatively benign, not moving us beyond tipping points which result in
an accelerated release of methane that could result in a temperature
increase of more than 8 °C, possibly producing infinite impacts.47
Calculating illustrative numbers By including the welfare of future
generations, something that is important when their very existence is
threatened, economic discounting becomes difficult. In this chapter,
some illustrative numbers are provided to indicate the order of
magnitude of the values that calculations provide when traditional
calculations also include future generations. These illustrative
calculations are only illustrative as the timespans that must be used
make all traditional assumptions questionable to say the least. Still,
as an indicator for why infinite impact might be a good approximation
they might help. As a species that can manipulate our environment it
could be argued that the time the human race will be around, if we do
not kill ourselves, can be estimated to be between 1-10 million years --
the typical time period for the biological evolution of a successful
species48 -- and one billion years, the inhabitable time of Earth.49
\[FIGURE 4 OMITTED\] \[FIGURE 5 OMITTED\] If we assume -- 50 million
years for the future of humanity as our reference, -- an average life
expectancy of 100 years50, and -- a global population of 6 billion
people51 -- all conservative estimate -- , we have half a million
generations ahead of us with a total of 3 quadrillion individuals.
Assuming a value of \$50,000 per life, the cost of losing them would
then be \$1.5 ×1020, or \$150 quintillion. This is a very low estimate,
and Posner suggests that maybe the cost of a life should be "written up
\$28 million" for catastrophic risks52. Posner's calculations where only
one future generation is included result in a cost of \$336 quadrillion.
If we include all future generations with the same value, \$28 million,
the result is a total cost of \$86 sextillion, or \$86 × 1021. This \$86
sextillion is obviously a very rough number (using one billion years
instead of 50 million would for example require us to multiply the
results by 20), but again it is the magnitude that is interesting. As a
reference there are about 1011 to 1012 stars in our galaxy, and perhaps
something like the same number of galaxies. With this simple calculation
you get 1022 to 1024, or 10 to 1,000 sextillion, stars in the universe
to put the cost of infinite impacts when including future generations in
perspective.53 These numbers can be multiplied many times if a more
philosophical and technology-optimistic scenario is assumed for how many
lives we should include in future generations. The following quote is
from an article by Nick Bostrom in Global Policy Journal: "However, the
relevant figure is not how many people could live on Earth but how many
descendants we could have in total. One lower bound of the number of
biological human life-years in the future accessible universe (based on
current cosmological estimates) is 1034 years. Another estimate, which
assumes that future minds will be mainly implemented in computational
hardware instead of biological neuronal wetware, produces a lower bound
of 1054 human-brain-emulation subjective life-years." 54 Likewise the
value of a life, \$28 million, a value that is based on an assessment of
how individuals chose when it comes to flying, can be seen as much too
small. This value is based on how much we value our own lives on the
margin, and it is reasonable to assume that the value would be higher
than only a multiplication of our own value if we also considered the
risk of losing our family, everyone we know, as well as everyone else on
the planet. In the same way as the cost increases when a certain product
is in short supply, the cost of the last humans could be assumed to be
very high, if not infinite. Obviously, the very idea to put a price on
the survival of humanity can be questioned for good reasons, but if we
still want to use a number, \$28 million per life should at least be
considered as a significant underestimation. For those that are
reluctant or unable to use infinity in calculations and are in need of a
number for their formulas, \$86 sextillion could be a good initial start
for the cost of infinite impacts. But it is important to note that this
number might be orders of magnitude smaller than an estimate which
actually took into account a more correct estimation of the number of
people that should be included in future generations as well as the
price that should be assigned to the loss of the last humans. 2.3.3
Infinite impact threshold (IIT) As we address very complex systems, such
as human civilisation and global ecosystems, a concept as important as
infinite impact in this report is that of infinity impact threshold.
This is the impact level that can trigger a chain of events that results
in the end of human civilisation. The infinite impact threshold (IIT)
concept represents the idea that long before an actual infinite impact
is reached there is a tipping point where it (with some probability) is
no longer possible to reverse events. So instead of focusing only on the
ultimate impact it is important to estimate what level of impact the
infinity threshold entails. The IIT is defined as an impact that can
trigger a chain of events that could result first in a civilisation
collapse, and then later result in an infinite impact. Such thresholds
are especially important to recognise in a complex and interconnected
society where resilience is decreasing. Social and ecological systems
are complex, and in most complex systems there are thresholds where
positive feedback loops become self-reinforcing. In a system where
resilience is too low, feedback loops can result in a total system
collapse. These thresholds are very difficult to estimate and in most
cases it is possible only to estimate their order of magnitude. As David
Orrell and Patrick McSharry wrote in A Systems Approach to Forecasting:
"Complex systems have emergent properties, qualities that cannot be
predicted in advance from knowledge of systems components alone".
According to complexity scientist Stephen Wolfram's principle of
computational irreducibility, the only way to predict the evolution of
such a system is to run the system itself: "There is no simple set of
equations that can look into its future." 55 Orrell and McSharry also
noted that "in orthodox economics, the reductionist approach means that
the economy is seen as consisting of individual, independent agents who
act to maximise their own utility. It assumes that prices are driven to
a state of near-equilibrium by the 'invisible hand' of the economy.
Deviations from this state are assumed to be random and independent, so
the price fluctuations are often modelled using the normal distribution
or other distributions with thin tails and finite variance." The
drawbacks of an approach using the normal distribution, or other
distributions with thin tails and finite variance, become obvious when
the unexpected happens as in the recent credit crunch, when existing
models totally failed to capture the true risks of the economy. As an
employee of Lehman Brothers put it on August 11, 2007: "Events that
models predicted would happen only once in 10,000 years happened every
day for three days." 56 \[FIGURE 6 OMITTED\] The exact level for an
infinite impact threshold should not be the focus, but rather the fact
that such thresholds exists and that an order of magnitude should be
estimated.57 During the process of writing the report, experts suggested
that a relatively quick death of two billion people could be used as a
tentative number until more research is available.58 With current trends
undermining ecological and social resilience it should be noted that the
threshold level is likely to become lower as time progress. 2.3.4 Global
F-N curves and ALARP In the context of global risks with potentially
infinite impact, the possibility of establishing global F-N curves is
worth exploring. One of the most common and flexible frameworks used for
risk criteria divides risks into three bands: 59 1. Upper: an
unacceptable/ intolerable region, where risks are intolerable except in
extraordinary circumstances and risk reduction measures are essential.
2. Middle: an ALARP ("as low as reasonably practicable") region, where
risk reduction measures are desirable but may not be implemented if
their cost is disproportionate to the benefit achieved. 3. Lower: a
broadly acceptable/ negligible region, where no further risk reduction
measures are needed. The bands are expressed by F-N curves. When the
frequency of events which cause at least N fatalities is plotted against
the number N on log--log scales, the result is called an F-N curve.60 If
the frequency scale is replaced by annual probability, then the
resultant curve is called an f-N curve. The concept for the middle band
when using F-N curves is ALARP. It is a term often used in the area of
safety-critical and safety-involved systems.62 The ALARP principle is
that the residual risk should be as low as reasonably practicable. The
upper band, the unacceptable/ intolerable region, is usually the area
above the ALARP area (see figure 8) By using F-N curves it is also
possible to establish absolute impact levels that are never acceptable,
regardless of probability (Figure 7. Based on an actual F-n Curve
showing an absolute impact level that is defined as unacceptable). This
has been done in some cases for local projects. The infinite threshold
could be used to create an impact limit on global F-N curves used for
global challenges in the future. Such an approach would help
governments, companies and researchers when they develop new technical
solutions and when investing in resilience. Instead of reducing risk,
such an approach encourages the building of systems which cannot have
negative impacts above a certain level. Pros -- Clearly shows
relationship between frequency and size of accident -- Allows judgement
on relative importance of different sizes of accident -- Slope steeper
than -1 provides explicit consideration of multiple fatality aversion
and favours concepts with lower potential for large fatality events --
Allows company to manage overall risk exposure from portfolio of all
existing and future facilities Cons -- Cumulative expression makes it
difficult to interpret, especially by non-risk specialists -- Can be
awkard to derive -- May be difficult to use if criterion is exceeded in
one area but otherwise is well below -- Much debate about criterion
lines Figure 7: Example of F-n curve showing different levels of risk 61

methodology exists that provides a constantly updated list of risks that
threaten human civilisation, or even all human life. Given that such a
category can help society to better understand and act to avoid such
risks, and better understand the relation between these risks, it can be
argued that a name for this category would be helpful.65 To name
something that refers to the end of humanity is in itself a challenge,
as the very idea is so far from our usual references and to many the
intuitive feeling will be to dismiss any such thing. The concept used in
this report is "infinity". The reson for this is that many of the
challenges relate to discussed. In one way the name is not very
important so long as people understand the impacts and risks associated
with it. Still, a name is symbolic and can either help or make it more
difficult to get support to establish the new category. The work to
establish a list of risks with infinite impact evolved from "existential
risk", the philosophical concept that inspired much of the work to
establish a clearly defined group of risks. The reason for not using the
concept "existential risk and impact" for this category, beside the fact
that existential impact is also used in academic contexts to refer to a
personal impact, is that the infinite category is a smaller subset of
"existential risk" and this new category is meant to be used as a tool,
not a scientific concept. Not only should the impacts in the category
potentially result in the end of all human life, it should be possible
to affect the probability and/or impact of that risk. There must also
exist an agreed methodology, such as the one suggested in this report,
that decides what risks belong and not belong on the list. Another
concept that the category relates to is "global catastrophic risk" as it
is one of the most used concepts among academics interested in infinite
impacts. However it is vague enough to be used to refer to impacts from
a few thousand deaths to the end of human civilisation. Already in use
but not clearly defined, it includes both the academic concept
existential risks and the category of risks with infinite impacts.
macroeconomics and its challenges in relation to the kind of impacts
that the risks in this report focus on. Further, the name clearly
highlights the unique nature without any normative judgements. Still,
infinity is an abstract concept and it might not be best communicate the
unique group of risks that it covers to all stakeholders. In the same
way as it can be hard to use singularity to describe a black hole, it
can be difficult to use infinity to describe a certain risk. If people
can accept that it is only from a specific perspective that the infinity
concept is relevant it could be used beyond the areas of macroeconomics.
Two other concepts that also have been considered during the process of
writing this report are "xrisks" and "human risk of ruin". Xrisk has the
advantage, and disadvantage, of not really saying anything at all about
the risk. The positive aspect is that the name can be associated with
the general concept of extinction and the philosophical concept of
existential risk as both have the letter x in them. The disadvantage is
the x often represents the unknown and can therefore relate to any risk.
There is nothing in the name that directly relates to the kind of
impacts that the category covers, so it is easy to interpret the term as
just unknown risks. Human risk of ruin has the advantage of having a
direct link to a concept, risk of ruin, that relates to a very specific
state where all is lost. Risk of ruin is a concept in use in gambling,
insurance, and finance that can all give very important contributions to
the work with this new category of risk. The resemblance to an existing
concept that is well established could be both a strength and a
liability. Below is an overview of the process when different names were

Global Challenges -- Twelve risks that threaten human civilisation --
The case for a new category of risks 47 2.3 Global challenges and
infinite impact 3. 2. 1. 9. Unacceptable risks in different
combinations, e.g. unacceptable global risks -- This is probably not
appropriate for two main reasons. First, it is a normative statement and
the category aims to be scientific; whether these risks are unacceptable
or not is up to the citizens of the world to decide. Second, the idea of
risk is that it is a combination of probability times impact. If a risk
is unacceptable is therefore also usually related to how easy it is to
avoid. Even if a risk is small, due to relatively low probability and
relatively low impact, but is very easy to address, it can be seen as
unacceptable, in the same way a large risk can be seen as acceptable if
it would require significant resources to reduce. There will not be a
perfect concept and the question is what concept can find the best
balance between being easy to understand, acceptable where policy
decisions needs to be made and also acceptable for all key groups that
are relevant for work in these area. During the process to find a name
for this category inspiration has been found in the process when new
concepts have been introduced; from irrational numbers and genocide to
sustainable development and the Human Development Index. So far
"infinite risk" can be seen as the least bad concept in some areas and
"xrisks" and "human risk of ruin" the least bad in others. The purpose
of this report is to establish a methodology to identify a very specific
group of risks as well as continue to a process where these risks will
be addressed in a systematic and appropriate way. The issue of naming
this group of risks will be left to others. The important is that the
category gets the attention it deserves. The three concepts are very
different. Global catastrophic risk is possibly the most used concept in
contexts where infinite impacts are included, but it is without any
clear definition. Existential risk is an academic concept used by a much
smaller group and with particular focus on future technologies. The
category in this report is a tool to help decision makers develop
strategies that help reduce the probability that humanity will end when
it can be avoided. The relation between the three concepts can be
illustrated with three circles. The large circle (1) represents global
catastrophic risks, the middle one (2) existential risks and the small
circle (3) the list of twelve risks in this report, i.e. risks where
there are peer reviewed academic studies that estimate the probability
of an infinite impact and where there are known ways to reduce the risk.
A list that could be called infinite risks, xrisks, or human risk of
ruin. Other concepts that are related to infinite impacts that could
potentially be used to describe the same category if the above
suggestions are not seen as acceptable concepts are presented below,
together with the main reason why these concepts were not chosen for
this report. 1. Risk of ruin -- is a concept in gambling, insurance and
finance relating to the likelihood of losing all one's capital or
affecting one's bankroll beyond the point of recovery. It is used to
describe individual companies rather than systems.66 2. Extinction risk
-- is used in biology for any species that is threatened. The concept is
also used in memory/cognition research. It is a very dramatic term, to
be used with care. These factors make it probably unsuitable for use by
stakeholders accustomed to traditional risk assessment. 3. Astronomical
risk -- is seldom used scientifically, but when it is used it is often
used for asteroids and is probably best reserved for them.67 4.
Apocalyptic risk -- could have been suitable, as the original meaning is
apocálypsis, from the Greek ἀπό and καλύπτω meaning 'un-covering'. It is
sometime used, but in a more general sense, to mean significant risks.68
But through history and today it is mainly used for a religious end of
time scenario. Its strong links to unscientific doom-mongers make it
probably unsuitable for a scientific concept. 5. End-of-the-world risk -
belongs to the irrational doomsday narratives and so is probably
unsuitable for scientific risk assessments. 6. Extreme risk -- is vague
enough to describe anything beyond the normal, so it is probably
unsuitable for risk assessments of this magnitude. 7. Unique risk -- is
even vaguer, as every risk is unique in some way. Probably best avoided
in risk assessments. 8. Collapse risk -- is based on Jared Diamond's
thinking.69 There are many different kinds of collapse and only a few
result in infinite impact. 48 Global Challenges -- Twelve risks that

overview In order to establish a list of global risks with potentially

selection of relevant organisations and their priorities. -- A
qualitative assessment with the help of expert workshops. 2.4
Methodology 70 Global Challenges -- Twelve risks that threaten human
civilisation -- The case for a new category of risks 49 2.4 Methodology
The scientific review of literature was led by Seth Baum, Executive
Director of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute72 and research
scientist at the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions,
Columbia University.73 The methodology for including global risks with a
potentially infinite impact is based on a scientific review of key
literature, with focus on peer-reviewed academic journals, using keyword
search of both World of Knowledge74 and Google Scholar75 combined with
existing literature overviews in the area of global challenges. This
also included a snowball methodology where references in the leading
studies and books were used to identify other scientific studies and
books. In order to select words for a literature search to identify
infinite impacts, a process was established to identify words in the
scientific literature connected to global challenges with potentially
infinite impacts. Some words generate a lot of misses, i.e. publications
that use the term but are not the focus of this report. For example
"existential risk" is used in business; "human extinction" is used in
memory/cognition. Some search terms produced relatively few hits. For
example "global catastrophic risk" is not used much. Other words are
only used by people within a specific research community: few use
"existential risk" in our sense unless they are using Nick Bostrom's
work. The term "global catastrophe" was identified as a phrase that
referred almost exclusively to extremely negative impacts on humans, by
a diversity of researchers, not just people in one research community. A
list of 178 relevant books and reports was established based on what
other studies have referred to, and/or which are seen as landmark
studies by groups interviewed during the process. They were selected for
a closer examination regarding the challenges they include.76 The full
bibliography, even with its focus on publications of general interest,
is still rather long. So it is helpful to have a shorter list focused on
the highlights; the most important publications based on how often they
are quoted, how wellspread the content (methodology, lists, etc.) is and
how often key organisations use them. The publications included must
meet at least one of the following criteria: -- Historical significance.
This includes being the first publication to introduce certain key
concepts, or other early discussions of global challenges. Publications
of historical significance are important for showing the intellectual
history of global challenges. Understanding how the state of the art
research got to where it is today can also help us understand where it
might go in the future. -- Influential in developing the field. This
includes publications that are highly cited77 and those that have
motivated significant additional research. They are not necessarily the
first publications to introduce the concepts they discuss, but for
whatever reason they will have proved important in advancing research.
-- State of the art. This includes publications developing new concepts
at the forefront of global challenges research as well as those
providing the best discussions of important established concepts.
Reading these publications would bring a researcher up to speed with
current research on global challenges. So they are important for the
quality of their ideas. -- Covers multiple global challenges (at least
two). Publications that discuss a variety of global challenges are of
particular importance because they aid in identifying and comparing the
various challenges. This process is essential for research on global
risks to identify boundaries and research priorities. In order to
identify which global challenges are most commonly discussed, key
surveys were identified and coded. First, a list of publications that
survey at least three global challenges was compiled, and they were then
scanned to find which challenges they discussed. The publications that
survey many global challenges were identified from the full
bibliography. Publications from both the academic and popular literature
were considered. Emphasis was placed on publications of repute or other
significance.78 To qualify as a survey of global challenges, the
publication had to provide an explicit list of challenges or to be of
sufficient length and breadth for it to discuss a variety of challenges.
Many of the publications are books or book-length collections of
articles published in book form or as special issues of scholarly
journals. Some individual articles were also included because they
discussed a significant breadth of challenges. A total of 40 global
challenge survey publications were identified. For authors with multiple
entries (Bostrom with three and WEF with ten) each challenge was counted
only once to avoid bias. review of key literature 71 2.4.1 A scientific

In terms of authorship and audience, there are 17 academic publications,
9 popular publications, 1 government report, 3 publications written by
academics for popular audiences. In terms of format, there are 15 books,
5 edited collections, 7 articles, 3 of miscellaneous format. Of the 40
publications identified, 22 were available at the time of coding. In
addition, 10 Global Risks Reports from the World Economic Forum were
coded and then gathered under one heading: "WEF Global Risk Report
2005-2014". A list of 34 global challenges was developed based on the
challenges mentioned in the publications. A spreadsheet containing the
challenges and the publications was created to record mentions of
specific challenges in each publication to be coded. Then each
publication was scanned in its entirety for mentions of global
challenges. Scanning by this method was necessary because many of the
publications did not contain explicit lists of global challenges, and
the ones that did often mentioned additional challenges separately from
their lists. So it was not required that a global challenge be mentioned
in a list for it to be counted -- it only had to be mentioned somewhere
in the publication as a challenge. Assessing whether a particular
portion of text counts as a global challenge and which category it fits
in sometimes requires some interpretation. This is inevitable for most
types of textual analysis, or, more generally, for the coding of
qualitative data. The need for interpretation in this coding was
heightened by the fact that the publications often were not written with
the purpose of surveying the breadth of global challenges, and even the
publications that were intended as surveys did not use consistent
definitions of global challenges. The coding presented here erred on the
side of greater inclusivity: if a portion of text was in the vicinity of
a global challenge, then it was coded as one. For example, some
publications discussed risks associated with nuclear weapons in a
general sense without specifically mentioning the possibility of
large-scale nuclear war. These discussions were coded as mentions of
nuclear war, even though they could also refer to single usages of
nuclear weapons that would not rate as a global challenge. This more
inclusive approach is warranted because many of the publications were
not focused exclusively on global challenges. If they were focused on
them, it is likely that they would have included these risks in their
global challenge form (e.g., nuclear war), given that they were already
discussing something related (e.g., nuclear weapons). Below are the
results from the overview of the surveys. Figure 9: Number of times

human extinction 0 200 400 600 800 1000 It should be noted that the
literature that includes multiple global challenges with potentially
infinite impact is very small, given the fact that it is about the
survival of the human race. Experts in the field of global challenges,
like Nick Bostrom, have urged policymakers and donors to focus more on
the global challenges with infinite impacts and have used dramatic
rhetoric to illustrate how little research is being done on them
compared with other areas. However, it is important to note that many
more studies exist that focus on individual global risks, but often
without including low-probability high-impact outcomes.80 How much work
actually exists on human extinction infinite impact is therefore
difficult to assess. The list of risks found in the scientific
literature was checked against a review of what challenges key
organisations working on global challenges include in their material and
on their webpages. This was done to ensure that no important risk was
excluded from the list. The coding of key organisations paralleled the
coding of key survey publications. Organisations were identified via the
global catastrophic risk organisation directory published by the Global
Catastrophic Risk Institute.82 They were selected from the directory if
they worked on a variety of global challenges -- at least three, and
ideally more. The reason for focusing on those that work on multiple
challenges is to understand which challenges they consider important and
why. In contrast, organisations that focus on only one or two challenges
may not Figure 10: The global challenges included ten times or more in

according to which challenges they consider the most important. The
organisation coding used the same coding scheme developed for coding
survey publications. References to specific global challenges were
obtained from organisations' websites. Many have web pages which list
the topics they work on. Where possible, references to global challenges
were pulled from these pages. Additional references to these challenges
were identified by browsing other web pages, including recent
publications. While it is possible that some of these organisations have
worked on global challenges not mentioned on the web pages that were
examined, overall the main challenges that they have worked on have
probably been identified and coded. So the results should give a
reasonably accurate picture of what global challenges these
organisations are working on. Organisations working with global
challenges were initially selected on the basis of the literature
overview. A snowball sampling was conducted based on the list of
organisations identified, according to whether they claimed to work on
global challenges and/or their web page contained information about
"existential risk", "global catastrophic risk","human extinction" or
"greatest global challenges". Cross-references between organisations and
input during the workshops were also used to identify organisations. An
initial list of 180 organisations which work with global challenges was
established. Based on the production of relevant literature, which other
organisations referred to the organisation, and/or are seen as
influential by groups interviewed during the process, a short-list of
organisations were selected for a closer examination regarding the
challenges they work with. Then those working with multiple challenges
were selected, resulting in a list of 19 organisations.83 Below is the
overview of the results from the overview of key organisations working
with multiple global challenges. The organisations working on global
challenges vary widely in: 1. What they count as a global challenge 2.
How systematically they identify global challenges; and 3. Their
emphasis on the most important global challenges For most organisations
working with global challenges there are no explanations for the
methodology used to select the challenges. Only a few thought leaders,
like Tower Watson and their Extreme Risk Report 2013, have a framework
for the challenges and estimates of possible impacts. Figure 12: Global

2 6 10 14 In most cases there is neither a definition of the impact, nor
a definition of the probability. The report that focuses on global risk
which is probably best known is the WEF Global Risk Report. The WEF's
risk work, with many other groups', is probably best described as
belonging to the category of risk perception rather than risk
assessment, where experts are asked to estimate risks, but without any
clear definition of probability or impact. The more serious
organisations, like the WEF, also clearly define what they do as
discussing perception of risk, not a scientific assessment of the actual
risk. The WEF describes its perception methodology as follows: "This
approach can highlight areas that are of most concern to different
stakeholders, and potentially galvanise shared efforts to address them."
85 The question which people are asked to answer is: "What occurrence
causes significant negative impact for several countries and
industries?" 86 The respondents are then asked to provide a number on
two scales from 1-4, one for impact and another for likelihood (within
10 years).87 It is then up to the respondent to define what 1-4 means,
so the major value of the report is to track the changes in perception
over the years. Such perception approaches are obviously very
interesting and, as the WEF states, can influence actual probability as
the readers' decisions will be influenced by how different challenges
are perceived. Still, it is important to remember that the report does
not provide an assessment of the actual probability (0-100%) or an
assessment of the impact (and not the impact on human suffering, as many
respondents likely define risk in monetary terms for their own company
or country). An overview of WEF reports from the last ten years
indicates that the challenges that likely could happen when applying a
five year horizon, like the first signs of climate change, governmental
failure and traditional pandemic, are identified. On the other hand,
challenges which have very big impacts but lower probability, like
extreme climate change, nanotechnology, major volcanoes, AI, and
asteroids, tend to get less, or no, attention. An important question to
explore is whether a focus on the smaller but still serious impacts of
global challenges can result in an increased probability of infinite
impacts. For example, there are reasons to believe that a focus on
incremental adaptation instead of significant mitigation could be a
problem for climate change as it could result in high-carbon lock-in.88
Other research indicates that focus on commercially relevant smaller
pandemics could result in actions that make a major pandemic more
likely. It is argued that this could happen, for example, by encouraging
increased trade of goods while investing in equipment that scans for the
type of pandemics that are known. Such a system can reduce the
probability for known pandemics while at the same time resulting in an
increased probability for new and more serious pandemics.89 Figure 13:
The top 12 global challenges that key organisations work with 2.4.3
Workshops global risks 2.5 The list of Two workshops were arranged where
the selection of challenges was discussed, one with risk experts in
Oxford at the Future of Humanity Institute and the other in London with
experts from the financial sector. See Appendix 2 for agenda and
participants. In both workshops the list of global challenges was
discussed to see if any additional challenges should be included, or if
there were reasons to exclude some from the list. No challenge was
excluded at the workshops, but one was added. Although little research
exists yet that is able to verify the potential impacts, the
participants agreed to include Global System Collapse as a risk with
possible infinite impact. There was agreement that further research is
needed to clarify exactly what parts of the economic and political
system could collapse and result in a potentially infinite outcome. The
conclusion was that enough research exists to include such a collapse on
the list. Based on the risks identified in the literature review and in
the review of organisations and applying the criteria for potentially
infinite impact, these risks were identified: 1. Extreme Climate Change
2. Nuclear War 3. Global Pandemic 4. Ecological Catastrophe 5. Global
System Collapse 6. Major Asteroid Impact 7. Supervolcano 8. Synthetic
Biology 9. Nanotechnology 10. Artificial Intelligence (AI) 11. Unknown
Consequences 12. Future Bad Global Governance This is an initial list.
Additional risks will be added as new scientific studies become
available, and some will be removed if steps are taken to reduce their
probability90 and/or impact so that they no longer meet the criteria.
Four categories of global challenges The challenges included in this
report belong to four categories. The first, current challenges,
includes those where decisions today can result directly in infinite
impacts. They are included even if the time between action and impact
might be decades, as with climate change. The second category is
exogenous challenges, those where decisions do not -- currently --
influence probability, but can influence impact. The third category is
emerging challenges, those where technology and science are not advanced
enough to pose a severe threat today, but where the challenges will
probably soon be able to have an infinite impact. The technologies
included in emerging challenges, including synthetic biology,
nanotechnology and artificial intelligence (AI), will be critical to
finding solutions to infinite impacts. Including these technologies
should not be seen as an attempt to arrest them. If anything, the
development of sustainable solutions should be accelerated. But it is
equally important to create guidelines and frameworks to avoid their
misuse, whether intentional or accidental. The fourth category, future
global policy challenges, is of a different kind. It includes challenges
related to the consequences of an inferior or destructive global
governance system. This is especially important as well-intended actions
to reduce global challenges could lead to future global governance
systems with destructive impact. The first category, current challenges,
includes: 1. Extreme Climate Change 2. Nuclear War 3. Global Pandemic 4.
Ecological Catastrophe 5. Global System Collapse The second category,
exogenous challenges, covers: 6. Major Asteroid Impact 7. Supervolcano
Those in the third category, emerging challenges, are: 8. Synthetic
Biology 9. Nanotechnology 10. Artificial Intelligence (AI) 11. Unknown
Consequences The fourth category, global policy challenges, is: 12.
Future Bad Global Governance not included 2.5.1 Risks Many risks could
severely damage humanity but have not been included in this report. They
were excluded for one or more of three reasons: 1. Limited impact. Many
challenges can have significant local negative effects, without
approaching the "2 billion negatively affected" criterion - tsunamis,
for example, and chemical pollution. 2. No effective countermeasures.
The report focuses on promoting effective interventions and so ignores
challenges where nothing useful can be done to prevent or mitigate the
impact, as with nearby gamma-ray bursts. 3. Included in other
challenges. Many challenges are already covered by others, or have a
damage profile so similar that there seemed no need to have a separate
category. Population growth, for one, is an underlying driver
significant for climate change and eco-system catastrophe, but without
direct large-scale impacts. The challenges mentioned in the reviewed
literature and organisations which are not included in this report often
refer to economic damage such as "fiscal crises" or "unemployment".
While such impacts could have far-reaching consequences they are
obviously of another magnitude than those included here. Some of the
risks that were suggested and/or which exist in books and reports about
global risks were rejected according to the criteria above. They
include: 91 1. Astronomical explosion/nearby gamma-ray burst or
supernova.92 These seem to be events of extremely low probability and
which are unlikely to be survivable. Milder versions of them (where the
source is sufficiently far away) may be considered in a subsequent
report. ͢ Not included due to: No effective countermeasures 2. False
vacuum collapse. If our universe is in a false vacuum and it collapses
at any point, the collapse would expand at the speed of light destroying
all organised structures in the universe.93 This would not be
survivable. ͢ Not included due to: No effective countermeasures 3.
Chemical pollution. Increasingly, there is particular concern about
three types of chemicals: those that persist in the environment and
accumulate in the bodies of wildlife and people, endocrine disruptors
that can interfere with hormones, and chemicals that cause cancer or
damage DNA. ͢ Not included due to: Limited impact 4. Dangerous physics
experiments creating black holes/strangelets including high energy
physics. These risks are of low probability94 and have been subsumed
under "Uncertain Risks". ͢ Not included due to: Included in other
challenges 5. Destructive solar flares. Though solar flares or coronal
mass ejections could cause great economic damage to our technological
civilisation,95 they would not lead directly to mass casualties unless
the system lacks basic resilience. They have been subsumed in the Global
System Collapse category. ͢ Not included due to: Limited impact/included

Bostrom, who directs Oxford\'s Future of Humanity Institute, has argued
over the course of several papers that [human [extinction risks
are]{.mark} poorly understood and]{.underline}, worse still,
[**[severely underestimated by society]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Some of
these existential risks are fairly well known, especially the natural
ones. But others are obscure or even exotic. Most worrying to Bostrom is
the subset of existential risks that arise from human technology, a
subset that he expects to grow in number and potency over the next
century.¶ Despite his concerns about the risks posed to humans by
technological progress, Bostrom is no luddite. In fact, he is a longtime
advocate of transhumanism\-\--the effort to improve the human condition,
and even human nature itself, through technological means. In the long
run he sees technology as a bridge, a bridge we humans must cross with
great care, in order to reach new and better modes of being. In his
work, Bostrom uses the tools of philosophy and mathematics, in
particular probability theory, to try and determine how we as a species
might achieve this safe passage. What follows is my conversation with
Bostrom about some of the most interesting and worrying existential
risks that humanity might encounter in the decades and centuries to
come, and about what we can do to make sure we outlast them.¶ Some have
argued that we ought to be directing our resources toward humanity\'s
existing problems, rather than future existential risks, because many of
the latter are highly improbable. You have responded by suggesting that
**[[existential risk mitigation may]{.mark} in fact [be a dominant moral
priority]{.mark} over the alleviation of present
suffering]{.underline}**. Can you explain why? ¶ Bostrom: Well [suppose
you have a moral view that counts future people as being worth as much
as present people]{.underline}. You might say that fundamentally it
doesn\'t matter whether someone exists at the current time or at some
future time, just as many people think that from a fundamental moral
point of view, it doesn\'t matter where somebody is
spatially\-\--somebody isn\'t automatically worth less because you move
them to the moon or to Africa or something. [A human life is a human
life. If you have that moral point of view that future generations
matter in proportion to their population numbers, then you get this
**very stark implication that [existential risk mitigation has a much
higher utility than]{.mark} pretty much [anything else]{.mark} that you
could do**. There are so [many]{.mark} people that [could]{.mark} [come
into existence]{.mark} in the future if humanity survives this critical
period of time\-\--we might live for billions of years, our descendants
might colonize billions of solar systems, and there could be billions
and [billions times more people]{.mark} than exist currently**.
Therefore, [even a very small reduction in the probability of realizing
this]{.mark} enormous [good will]{.mark} tend to [outweigh]{.mark} even
immense [benefits like eliminating poverty or curing
malaria]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which would be tremendous under ordinary
standards.

Playing with Wild Cards

Without doubt, simulations \-- including nonstandard ones \-- can aid
planning. The question is: To what end? And to what effect? Exploring
\"wild cards\" in order to identify warning signs or to define limits is
one thing; using them to establish force structure or modernization
requirements, quite another. Especially suspect would be using scenarios
that are detached from declared US interests to define current
requirements; this would put the military \"cart\" before the political
\"horse.\" Another, broader concern is how the effusion of improbable
conflict scenarios affects public policy discourse overall.

[[Conflict scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark}, both wild and tame, [can
[gain **more credibility**]{.mark} in the telling [than they
deserve]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Cognitive researcher Massimo
[Piattelli]{.mark}-Palmarini [calls this the]{.mark} \"[Othello
effect]{.mark},\" referring to the trail of **plausible** but **false
suppositions**]{.underline} that led Othello to murder his wife,
Desdemona. [Even the most **farfetched [scenarios]{.mark}** [comprise a
**number of**]{.mark} **steps or [links]{.mark}** each of [which may
seem plausible]{.mark} or even probable [given the one]{.mark} that came
[before]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although [the [likelihood]{.mark} of the
scenario **[dwindles with each step]{.mark}**,]{.underline} the residual
[impression is one of plausibility]{.underline}. [[Omitted are]{.mark}
the many [branches]{.mark} at [**each step** that would lead to a
neutral]{.mark} or even positive [outcome]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
resulting **[snapshots]{.mark}**]{.underline}, although numerous,
[[offer a **highly-selective** view of]{.mark} what [the future]{.mark}
may hold]{.underline}. And [[the fact]{.mark} that [only]{.mark} the
[negative outcomes are articulated]{.mark}]{.underline} and exercised
[can **[distort]{.mark} the**]{.underline} general public [impression of
[risk]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Living with Uncertainty

There is no escape from uncertainty, but there is relief from
uncertainty hysteria. It begins with recognizing that instability has
boundaries \-- just as turbulence in physical systems has discernable
onset points and parameters. The turbulence of a river, for instance,
corresponds to flow and to the contours of the river\'s bed and banks.
It occurs in patches and not randomly. The weather also is a chaotic
system that resists precise long-range forecasting, but allows useful
prediction of broader trends and limits.

Despite uncertainty, [statements of probability matter]{.underline}.
They indicate the weight of evidence \-- or whether there is any
evidence at all. The [[uncertainty]{.mark} hawks would [flood our
concern with]{.mark} a horde of [dangers that pass]{.mark} their
permissive test of [\"**non-zero probability**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"
However, [[by **lowering the threshold** of alarm]{.mark}, [they
establish]{.mark} an **[impossible]{.mark} standard of
[defense]{.mark}** sufficiency]{.underline}: absolute and certain
military security. Given finite resources and competing ends, something
less will have to do. [Strategic wisdom]{.underline} begins with the
setting of priorities \-- and priorities [demand strict attention to
what appears likely and what does not.]{.underline}

**Each life improved [solves]{.underline} an [existential]{.underline}
catastrophe \-- the butterfly effect [outweighs]{.underline}.**

Notice, the problem can be cast two different ways. First, the loss
associated with humanity\'s premature extinction is so great that even
if the probability of a catastrophic event is very low, an expected
value calculation suggests that we should strive to prevent its possible
occurrence. And yet, [[there is something]{.mark} **deeply
[puzzling]{.mark}** [about **ruining**]{.mark} the lives of]{.underline}
all [**actual [persons]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the sake of [humanity
eking out a **longer stay** in the universe]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Second, you may have realized that [the]{.underline} above [[implication
bears]{.mark} **close [resemblance]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **the dreaded
[Repugnant Conclusion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Repugnant Conclusion
states that for any population, all with a very high quality of life,
there must be some larger imaginable population whose existence, all
else being equal, would be better despite their lives being barely worth
living.19The mistake, as countless critics have noted, is that quantity
(that is, size of population) should not be able to compensate for a
stark reduction to their average quality of life.

I\'m inclined to agree that this looks worrisome. For some, if this were
the end of the story, it would surely act as a reductio ad absurdum of
the view. But this is not the full story.

[[**AN INDIRECT APPROACH** TO LOWERING]{.mark} THE **THREAT OF
[EXTINCTION]{.mark}**]{.underline}

In setting out our earlier comparison of the two populations it was
assumed that only costs go up, never benefits. That is to say, A was
fixed and the total sum of goods went up merely because the size of the
population grew, despite internalization costs reducing average quality
of life. Colouring in the picture, this corresponds to the scenario
where, all else being equal, existential threats are directly targeted.
To illustrate, this could amount to putting a lot of resources towards
asteroid deflection programmes.20

I now wish to argue that [[we could]{.mark} **instead [reduce]{.mark}**
[exi]{.mark}stential [risk by **indirect means**, and]{.mark} in so
doing make the world in **two ways go better**]{.underline}. As noted
earlier, [we would prolong humanity\'s place in the cosmos]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [an indirect approach [improve]{.mark}s the average welfare
of persons, particularly **the [worse-off]{.mark} in our
population**]{.underline}.

Certainly, it would be a mistake to concentrate exclusively on
indirectly lowering the probability of doomsday. Returning to our
earlier example, reducing global poverty cannot prevent an Earth-bound
asteroid the size of Texas from making impact. Nevertheless, [if
we]{.underline} were also to [adopt an **indirect approach**, then [this
would]{.mark} contribute to **existential risk reduction** by
[curbi]{.mark}ng the **negative [ripple effects]{.mark}**]{.underline}
of readily preventable illnesses, global hunger, and so forth.

[Ripple effects]{.underline} are a class of phenomena that [affect the
**far future** in significant ways]{.underline}, shaping how our history
unfolds over time.21A ripple effect is initiated by a particular event
that has some causal influence on the course of events that follow it.
[These events]{.underline}, in turn, may have their own
[impact]{.underline} on how [further]{.underline} events play out. And
so on it goes, [[reaching **wider**]{.mark} **and wider** [as time
passes]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Consider the following example. [[A doctor]{.underline}]{.mark} is in a
position to [[cure some]{.mark} infant\'s
[blindness]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sure, [the infant will]{.underline}
probably [have a better life after the operation]{.underline}. Most of
us are quick to hone-in on this feature of the situation. And many other
goods go unacknowledged by us as a result. [Just [a
few]{.mark}]{.underline} of the proximate
[[advantages]{.underline}]{.mark} we might reasonably expect to find
after curing the infant\'s blindness include: [[her
parents]{.underline}]{.mark} will be [[less worried]{.mark} about
her]{.underline}, subsequently finding [[more free
time]{.underline}]{.mark} to develop their own personal projects; the
[[government]{.underline}]{.mark} will [[spend fewer resources]{.mark}
on]{.underline} providing [her education; [this child will]{.mark} grow
up]{.underline} with more opportunities, as well as perhaps
[[be]{.mark}ing i[nspired to]{.mark} start a grassroots initiative or
[develop a]{.mark}n **anti-malarial [drug]{.mark}**]{.underline}. All of
these consequences will have some role in shaping our future due to
their own ripple effects. [This **[network]{.mark} of ripple effects**
[might]{.mark} go so far as [caus]{.mark}ing \'\[her\] country\'s
[economy to develop]{.mark} very slightly more quickly, [or make]{.mark}
**certain technological or cultural [innovations]{.mark}**
[arrive]{.mark} **more [quickly\']{.mark}**.]{.underline}22

**Infinite risk does not justify ignoring probability\-\--AND collapses
decision-making.**

The problem of the second method is that [it is very difficult to
\"calculate\"]{.underline} politically [unacceptable losses.
If]{.underline} the [[risk]{.underline}]{.mark} of terrorism [is
[defined]{.mark}]{.underline} in traditional terms
[[by]{.underline}]{.mark} probability and [[potential loss]{.mark},
then]{.underline} the [focus on dramatic]{.underline} terror [attacks
[leads to]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[marginalization of
probabilitie]{.mark}s]{.underline}**. The reason is that [[even the
highest]{.mark} degree of [improbability **becomes irrelevant**
as]{.mark} the measure of [loss **goes to
infinity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. \^o [The]{.underline} mathematical
[calculation of the risk]{.underline} of terrorism thus [tends to
overestimate and]{.underline} to [dramatize]{.underline} the [danger.
This has consequences beyond]{.underline} the actual [risk assessment
for the formulation]{.underline} and execution [of \"risk policies\": If
one factor]{.underline} of the risk calculation [approaches
infinity]{.underline} (e.g., if a case of nuclear terrorism is
envisaged), then [there is no balanced measure]{.underline} for
antiterrorist efforts, [and **[risk management as]{.mark} a
[rational]{.mark} endeavor [breaks down]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Under
the historical condition of bipolarity, the \"ultimate\" threat with
nuclear weapons could be balanced by a similar counterthreat, and new
equilibria could be achieved, albeit on higher levels of nuclear
overkill. [[Under]{.underline}]{.mark} the new condition of
[[uncertainty, no]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[rational balancing is
possible]{.mark} since knowledge]{.underline} about actors, their
motives and capabilities, [is largely absent]{.underline}. The second
form of [[security]{.mark} policy]{.underline} that emerges when the
deterrence model collapses mirrors the \"social probability\" approach.
It [[represents a **logic of catastrophe**]{.mark}. In contrast to
risk]{.underline} management [framed]{.underline} in line [with logical
probability]{.underline} theory, [the logic of catastrophe does not
attempt to provide means of absorbing uncertainty]{.underline}. Rather,
[it takes uncertainty as constitutive for]{.underline} the
[logic]{.underline} itself; [uncertainty is a]{.underline} crucial
[precondition for catastrophes]{.underline}. In particular, catastrophes
happen at once, [without]{.underline} a [warning]{.underline}, but with
major implications for the world polity. In this category, [we
find]{.underline} the impact of [meteorites]{.underline}. Mars attacks,
the tsunami in [South East Asia, and 9/11]{.underline}. [To conceive
of]{.underline} terrorism as [catastrophe has consequences
for]{.underline} the [formulation of]{.underline} an [adequate security
policy]{.underline}. Since [[catastrophes hap-pen irrespectively
of]{.mark} human [activity]{.mark}]{.underline} or inactivity, [[**no
political action** could]{.underline}]{.mark} possibly [[prevent
them]{.underline}]{.mark}. Of course, there are precautions that can be
taken, but [the framing of]{.underline} terrorist attack as [a
catastrophe points to spatial and temporal characteristics that are
beyond \"rationality.\" Thus]{.underline}, political [decision makers
are exempt]{.underline}ed [from the responsibility to provide
security]{.underline}---as long as they at least try to preempt an
attack. Interestingly enough, 9/11 was framed as catastrophe in various
commissions dealing with the question of who was responsible and whether
it could have been prevented. This makes clear that under the condition
of uncertainty, there are no objective criteria that could serve as an
anchor for measuring dangers and assessing the quality of political
responses. For ex- ample, as much as one might object to certain
measures by the US administration, it is almost impossible to
\"measure\" the success of countermeasures. Of course, there might be a
subjective assessment of specific shortcomings or failures, but there is
no \"common\" currency to evaluate them. As a consequence, [the
framework of]{.underline} the [security]{.underline} dilemma [fails to
capture]{.underline} the [basic uncertainties]{.underline}. Pushing the
door open for the security paradox, the main problem of security
analysis then becomes the question how to integrate dangers in risk
assessments and security policies about which simply nothing is known.
In the mid 1990s, a Rand study entitled \"New Challenges for Defense
Planning\" addressed this issue arguing that \"most striking is the fact
that [we do not]{.underline} even [know]{.underline} who or what will
constitute [[the most serious]{.mark} future
[threat]{.mark}]{.underline}, \"\^i [In order to cope]{.underline} with
this challenge it would be essential, another Rand researcher wrote, to
break free from [the]{.underline} \"tyranny\" of plausible scenario
planning. The decisive [step [would]{.mark} be to [create
\"discontinuous scenarios]{.mark} \... in [which there is **no
plausible**]{.mark}]{.underline} audit **[[trail]{.underline}]{.mark}**
or storyline from current events\"52 These nonstandard scenarios were
later called \"wild cards\" and became important in the current US
strategic discourse. They justified the transformation from a
threat-based toward a capability- based defense planning strategy.53 The
problem with this kind of risk assessment is, however, that [[even the
most **absurd scenarios**]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[gain]{.mark}
plausibility]{.underline}. [By constructing [a **chain of
potentialities**]{.mark}, improbable events are linked and brought
into]{.underline} the realm of [the possible, if not]{.underline} even
the [probable]{.underline}. \"[Although]{.underline} the
[[likelihood]{.underline}]{.mark} of the scenario [[dwindles]{.mark}
with each step, [the]{.mark}]{.underline} residual [[impression
is]{.underline}]{.mark} one [of [plausibility]{.mark}]{.underline}. \"54
This so-called Othello effect has been effective in the dawn of the
recent war in Iraq. [The connection between Saddam]{.underline} Hussein
[and Al Qaeda]{.underline} that the US government tried to prove [was
disputed from the]{.underline} very [beginning. False evidence
was]{.underline} again and again [presented and refuted, but this did
not prevent the]{.underline} administration from presenting as the main
rationale for war the [improbable yet possible connection]{.underline}
between Iraq and the terrorist network and the improbable yet possible
proliferation of an improbable yet possible nuclear weapon into the
hands of Bin Laden. As Donald Rumsfeld famously said: \"**[Absence of
evidence is not evidence of absence]{.underline}**.\" This sentence
indicates that under the condition of genuine uncertainty, different
evidence criteria prevail than in situations where security problems can
be assessed with relative certainty.

**Prioritizing magnitude collapses into irrationality and inaction.**

Advocates All Attending Mass? Philosophical Comment, 2-1-15,
http://philosophicalcomment.blogspot.com/2015/02/why-arent-existential-risk-ultimate.html\]//BPS

An increasingly popular genre in the sort of applied philosophy and
ethics of technology, which does not so much engage with actual
technological development as more or less wild phantasies about possibly
forthcoming ones is the notions of [[\"ex]{.mark}istential
[risks\"]{.mark} or \"ultimate harms\"]{.underline}, or similar
expressions. The theme [is]{.underline} currently inspiring several
research environments at world-leading universities, such as this one
and this one (where you can find many links to other sources, articles,
blog posts, and so on), and given quite a bit of space in recent
scholarly literature on a topic often referred to as the ethics of
emerging technology. Now, personally and academically, as it has
actually proceeded, I have found much of this development being to a
large extent [a case of the emperor\'s new clothes]{.underline}. The
fact that there are possible threats to human civilizations, the
existence of humanity, life on earth or, at least, extended human
well-being, is not exactly news, is it? Neither is there any kind of new
insight that some of these are created by humans themselves. Also, it is
not any sort of recent revelation that established moral ideas, or
theories of rational decision making, may provide reason for avoiding or
mitigating such threats. Rather, both these theses follow rather
trivially from a great many well-established ethical and philosophical
theories, and are well-known to do so since hundreds of years. Still,
piece after piece is being produced in the [existential risk
genre]{.underline} making this out as some sort of recent finding, and
exposing grand gestures at proving the point against more or less
clearly defined straw-men.

At the same time, quite a bit of what is currently written on the topic
[[strikes me as]{.mark} **philosophically
[shallow]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For instance, the notion that the
eradication of the human species has to be a bad thing seems to be far
from obvious from a philosophical point of view - this would depend on
such things as the source of the value of specifically human existence,
the manner of the imagined extinction (it certainly does not have to
involve any sort of carnage or catastrophe), and what might possibly
come instead of humanity or currently known life when extinct and how
that is to be valued. Similarly, it is a very common step in the typical
existential risk line to jump rather immediately from the proposition of
such a risk to the suggestion that substantial (indeed, massive)
resources should be spent on its prevention, mitigation or management.
This goes for everything from imagined large scale geo-engineering
solutions to environmental problems, dreams of outer space migration, to
so-called human enhancement to adapt people to be able to handle
otherwise massive threats in a better way. At the same time, the
advocates of the existential risk line of thought also urges caution in
the application of new hitherto unexplored technology, such as synthetic
biology or (if it ever comes to appear) \"real\" A.I. and android
technology. However, also there, the angle of analysis is often
restricted to this very call, typically ignoring the already since long
ongoing debates in the ethics of technology, bioethics, environmental
ethics, et cetera, where the issue of how much of and what sort of such
caution may be warranted in light of various good aspects of different
the technologies considered. And, to be frank, this simplification seems
to be the only thing that is special with the existential risk argument
advocacy: the idea that the mere possibility of a catastrophic scenario
justifies substantial sacrifices, without having to complicate things by
pondering alternative uses of resources.

Now, [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} kind of argument,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} (or should be) [**well-[known]{.mark}** to
anyone with a philosophical education, since it seems to share the basic
form of the **philosophical classic known [as Pascal\'s
Wager]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this argument, French enlightenment
philosopher and mathematician, Blaise Pascal offered a \"proof\" of the
rationality of believing in God (the sort of God found in abrahamitic
monotheistic religion, that is), based on the possible consequences of
belief or non-belief, given the truth or falsity of the belief. You can
explore the details of Pascal\'s argument, but the basic idea is that in
the face of the immense consequences of belief and non-belief if God
exists (eternal salvation vs. eternal damnation), [[it is rational to
bet on]{.underline}]{.mark} the existence of [[God, no matter]{.mark}
what theoretical or other evidence]{.underline} for the truth of this
belief [exists and no matter the [probability]{.mark} of this truth. It
seems to me]{.underline} that [the **typical [ex]{.mark}istential
[risk]{.mark} argument advocacy** [subscribes to]{.mark} a **very
[similar logic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For instance, the standard line
to defend that resources should be spent on probing and (maybe)
facilitating), e.g., possible extraterrestial migration for humanity,
seems to have the following form:

1\) Technology T might possibly prevent/mitigate existential risk, E

2\) It would be really, really, very, very bad if E was to be actualised

3\) Therefore: If E was otherwise to be actualised, it would be really,
really, very, very good if E was prevented

4\) Therefore: If E was otherwise to be actualised, it would be really,
really, very, very good if we had access to a workable T

5\) Therefore: there are good reasons to spend substantial resources on
probing and (maybe, if that turns out to be possible) facilitating a
workable T

That is, what drives the argument is the (mere) possibility of a
massively significant outcome, and the (mere) possibility of a way to
prevent that particular outcome, thus doing masses of good. Now, I\'m
sure that everyone can see that this argument is far from obviously
valid, even if we ignore the question of whether or not premise 2 is
true, and this goes for Pascal\'s Wager too in parallel ways. For
instance, [the existential risk [arg]{.mark}ument]{.underline} above
[seems to **[ignore]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[there seems to
be]{.mark} an **[innumerable]{.mark} amount** of]{.underline} thus
[**(merely) possible existential risk [scenarios]{.mark}**, as well as
**[innumerable]{.mark} (merely) possibly [work]{.mark}able
technologies** [that]{.mark} might help to prevent or
[mitigate]{.mark}]{.underline} each of [[these, and it is
**unlikely**]{.mark} **(to say the least)**]{.underline} that [[we have
resources to **bet**]{.mark} **substantially** [on them **all**, unless
we spread them **so thin**]{.mark} that **[this]{.mark} action**
[becomes **meaningless**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, there are
innumerable possible versions of the god that lures you with threats and
promises of damnation and salvation, and what that particular god may
demand in return, often implying a ban on meeting a competing deity\'s
demands, so the wager doesn\'t seem to tell you to try to start
believing in any particular of all these (merely) possible gods.
Likewise, [the [arg]{.mark}ument above **[ignores]{.mark} completely**
the **(rather high) [likelihood]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [the
mobilised [resources will be]{.mark} **mostly [wasted]{.mark}**[,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} that, therefore, [there are **substantial
opportunity [costs]{.mark}** attached [to not using]{.mark} these
resources to use **[better]{.mark} proven [strategies]{.mark}** with
better identified threats and problems]{.underline} (say, preventing
global poverty) - [albeit maybe not as **massive** as the outcomes in
the **existential risk scenarios**]{.underline}. Similarly, Pascal\'s
Wager completely ignores all the good things one needs to give up to
meet the demands of the god promising eternal salvation in return (for
instance, spending your Sundays working for the allieviation of global
poverty). [[None]{.mark} of that is [worth **any
consideration**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the idea seems to be, [[in light
of]{.mark} the **massive [stakes]{.mark}** of the **existential risk** /
**religious belief** or **non-belief scenarios**]{.underline}.

Now, I will not pick any quarrel with the existential risk argument as
such on these grounds, although I do think that more developed ways to
analyse risk-scenarios and the ethical implications of these already in
existence and used in the fields I referred above will mean lots of
troubles for the simplistic aspects already mentioned. What I do want to
point to, however, is this: [[If you\'re impressed by the
ex]{.mark}istential [risk]{.mark} argument, [you should be]{.mark}
**equally [impressed]{.mark}** [by Pascal\'s Wager]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Thus, in accordance with Pascal\'s recommendation that authentic
religious belief can be gradually installed via the practice of rituals,
you should -- as should indeed the existential risk argument advocates
themselves -- spend your Sundays celebrating mass (or any other sort
ritual demanded by the God you bet on). [I **very much
doubt**]{.underline}, however, [that you]{.underline} (or they) in fact
[do]{.underline} that, [or even accept]{.underline} the conclusion that
[you]{.underline} (or they) [should]{.underline} be doing that.

A deep irony is embedded in the history of the scientific study of
international relations. Recent generations of scholars separated policy
from theory to gain an intellectual distance from decision-making, in
the belief that this would enhance the \'scientific\' quality of their
work. [But five decades of well-funded efforts to develop theories of
international relations have produced precious little in the way of
useful, high confidence results]{.underline}. [Theories abound, but few
meet the most relaxed \'scientific\' tests of validity. Even the most
robust generalizations or laws we can state --- war is more likely
between neighboring states, weaker states are less likely to attack
stronger states --- are close to trivial, have important exceptions, and
for the most part stand **outside any consistent body of
theory**]{.underline}. [A generation ago, we might have excused our
performance on the grounds that we were a young science still in the
process of defining problems, developing analytical tools and collecting
data. This excuse is neither credible nor sufficient; there is no reason
to suppose that another 50 years of well-funded research would result in
anything resembling a valid theory in the Popperian sense]{.underline}.
We suggest that the nature, goals and criteria for judging social
science theory should be rethought, if theory is to be more helpful in
understanding the real world. We begin by justifying our pessimism, both
conceptually and empirically, and argue that [the quest for predictive
theory **rests on a mistaken analogy** between physical and social
phenomena.]{.underline} Evolutionary biology is a more productive
analogy for social science. We explore the value of this analogy in its
\'hard\' and \'soft\' versions, and examine the implications of both for
theory and research in international relations.\' We develop the case
for forward \`tracking\' of international relations on the basis of
local and general knowledge as an alternative to backward-looking
attempts to build deductive, nomothetic theory. We then apply this
strategy to some emerging trends in international relations. [This
article is not a nihilistic diatribe against \'modern\' conceptions of
social science]{.underline}. [Rather, it is a plea for constructive
humility in the current context of attraction to deductive logic,
falsifiable hypothesis and large- n statistical \'tests\' of narrow
propositions]{.underline}. We [propose a practical alternative for
social scientists to pursue]{.underline} in addition, and in a
complementary fashion, to \`scientific\' theory-testing. Physical and
chemical laws make two kinds of predictions. Some phenomena --- the
trajectories of individual planets --- can be predicted with a
reasonable degree of certainty. Only a few variables need to be taken
into account and they can be measured with precision. Other mechanical
problems, like the break of balls on a pool table, while subject to
deterministic laws, are inherently unpredictable because of their
complexity. Small differences in the lay of the table, the nap of the
felt, the curvature of each ball and where they make contact, amplify
the variance of each collision and lead to what appears as a near random
distribution of balls. Most predictions in science are probabilistic,
like the freezing point of liquids, the expansion rate of gases and all
chemical reactions. Point predictions appear possible only because of
the large numbers of units involved in interactions. In the case of
nuclear decay or the expansion of gases, we are talking about trillions
of atoms and molecules. [In international relations, even more than in
other domains of social science, it is often impossible to assign
metrics to what we think are relevant variables]{.underline} (Coleman,
1964: especially Chapter 2). [The concepts of polarity, relative power
and the balance of power are among the most widely used independent
variables, but there are **no commonly accepted definitions or
measures** for them]{.underline}. [Yet without consensus on definition
and measurement, almost every statement or **hypothesis will have too
much wiggle room to be \`tested\'** decisively against
evidence]{.underline}. What we take to be dependent variables fare
little better. Unresolved controversies rage over the definition and
evaluation of deterrence outcomes, and about the criteria for democratic
governance and their application to specific countries at different
points in their history. [Differences in coding for even a few cases
have significant implications for tests of theories of deterrence or of
the democratic peace]{.underline} (Lebow and Stein, 1990; Chan, 1997).
[The lack of consensus about terms and their measurement is not merely
the result of intellectual anarchy or sloppiness]{.underline} ---
although the latter cannot entirely be dismissed. [Fundamentally, it has
more to do with the arbitrary nature of the concepts
themselves]{.underline}. [Key terms in physics, like mass, temperature
and velocity]{.underline}, refer to aspects of the physical universe
that we cannot directly observe. However, they are embedded in theories
with deductive implications that have been verified through empirical
research. Propositions containing these terms [are legitimate assertions
about reality because their truth-value can be assessed.]{.underline}
[Social science theories are for the most part **built on
\'idealizations\', that is, on concepts that cannot be anchored to
observable phenomena** through rules of correspondence]{.underline}.
[Most of these terms(e.g. rational actor, balance of power) are not
descriptions of reality but implicit \'theories\' about actors and
contexts that do not exist]{.underline} (Hempel, 1952; Rudner, 1966;
Gunnell, 1975; Moe, 1979; Searle, 1995: 68-72).[The inevitable
differences in interpretation of these concepts lead to different
predictions in some contexts, and these outcomes may eventually produce
widely varying futures]{.underline} (Taylor, 1985: 55). [If problems of
definition, measurement and coding could be resolved, we would still
find it difficult, if not impossible, to construct large enough samples
of comparable cases to permit statistical analysis]{.underline}. It is
now almost generally accepted that in the analysis of the causes of
wars, the variation across time and the complexity of the interaction
among putative causes make the likelihood of a general theory
extraordinarily low. Multivariate theories run into the problem of
negative degrees of freedom, yet [international relations rarely
generates data sets in the high double digits.]{.underline} Where
[larger samples]{.underline} do exist, they [often group together cases
that differ from one another in theoretically important
ways.\']{.underline} Complexity in the form of multiple causation and
equifinality can also make simple statistical comparisons misleading.
But it is hard to elaborate more sophisticated statistical tests until
one has a deeper baseline understanding of the nature of the phenomenon
under investigation, as well as the categories and variables that make
up candidate causes (Geddes, 1990: 131-50; Lustick, 1996: 505-18;
Jervis, 1997). Wars --- to continue with the same example --- are
similar to chemical and nuclear reactions in that they have underlying
and immediate causes. Even when all the underlying conditions are
present, these processes generally require a catalyst to begin. Chain
reactions are triggered by the decay of atomic nuclei. Some of the
neutrons they emit strike other nuclei prompting them to fission and
emit more neutrons, which strike still more nuclei. Physicists can
calculate how many kilograms of Uranium 235 or Plutonium at given
pressures are necessary to produce a chain reaction. They can take it
for granted that if a \'critical mass\' is achieved, a chain reaction
will follow. This is because trillions of atoms are present, and at any
given moment enough of them will decay to provide the neutrons needed to
start thereaction. In a large enough sample, catalysts will be present
in a statistical sense. Wars involve relatively few actors. Unlike the
weak force responsible for nuclear decay, their catalysts are probably
not inherent properties of the units. Catalysts may or may not be
present, and their potentially random distribution relative to
underlying causes makes it difficult to predict when or if an
appropriate catalyst will occur. If in the course of time underlying
conditions change, reducing basic incentives for one or more parties to
use force, catalysts that would have triggered war will no longer do so.
[This uncertain and evolving relationship between underlying and
immediate causes makes point **prediction extraordinarily
difficult**]{.underline}. [It also makes more general statements about
the causation of war problematic, since we have no way of knowing what
wars would have occurred in the presence of appropriate
catalysts]{.underline}. [It is probably impossible to define the
universe of would-be wars or to construct a representative sample of
them]{.underline}. [Statistical inference requires knowledge about the
state of independence of cases, but in a practical sense that knowledge
is often impossible to obtain in the analysis of international
relations]{.underline}. Molecules do not learn from experience. People
do, or think they do. Relationships among cases exist in the minds of
decision-makers, which makes it very hard to access that information
reliably and for more than just a very small number of cases. We know
that expectations and behavior are influenced by experience, one\'s own
and others. [The deterrence strategies pursued by the United States
throughout much of the Cold War were one kind of response to the failure
of appeasement to prevent World War II]{.underline}. Appeasement was at
least in part a reaction to the belief of British leaders that the
deterrent policies pursued by the continental powers earlier in the
century had helped to provoke World War I. Neither appeasement nor
deterrence can be explained without understanding the context in which
they were formulated; that context is ultimately a set of mental
constructs. We have descriptive terms like \'chain reaction\' or
\'contagion effect\' to describe these patterns, and hazard analysis
among other techniques in statistics to measure their strength. But
neither explains how and why these patterns emerge and persist. The
broader point is that the relationship between human beings and their
environment is not nearly so reactive as with inanimate objects. Social
relations are not clock-like because the values and behavioral
repertories of actors are not fixed; people have memories, learn from
experience and undergo shifts in the vocabulary they use to construct
reality. [Law-like relationships --- even if they existed --- could not
explain the most interesting social outcomes, since these are precisely
the outcomes about which actors have the most incentive to learn and
adapt their behavior]{.underline}. Any regularities would be \`soft\';
they would be the outcome of processes that areembedded in history and
have a short half-life. They would decay quickly because of the
memories, creative searching and learning by political leaders.
Ironically, the \`findings\' of social science contribute to this decay
(Weber, 1969; Almond and Genco, 1977: 496-522; Gunnell, 1982: Ch. 2;
Ball, 1987: Ch. 4; Kratochwil, 1989; Rorty, 1989; Hollis, 1994: Ch. 9).
Beyond these conceptual and empirical difficulties lies a familiar but
fundamental difference of purpose. Boyle\'s Law, half-lives, or any
other scientific principle based on probability, says nothing about the
behavior of single units such as molecules. For many theoretical and
practical purposes this is adequate. But social science ultimately
aspires --- or should aspire ---to provide insight into practical world
problems that are generally part of a small or very small n. In
international relations, the dynamicsa nd outcomes of single cases are
often much more important than any statistical regularities. [The
conception of causality on which deductive-nomological models are based,
in classical physics as well as social science, **requires empirical
invariance** under specified boundary conditions.]{.underline} The
standard form of such a statement is this --- given A, B and C, if X
then (not) Y.4 This kind of bounded invariance can be found in closed
systems[. Open systems can be influenced by external stimuli, and their
structure and causal mechanisms evolve as a result.]{.underline} Rules
that describe the functioning of an open system at time T do not
necessarily do so at T + 1 or T + 2. The boundary conditions may have
changed, rendering the statement irrelevant. Another axiomaticcondition
may have been added, and the outcome subject to multiple conjunctural
causation. There is no way to know this a priori from the causal
statement itself. Nor will complete knowledge (if it were possible)
about the system at time T necessarily allow us to project its future
course of development. In a practical sense, all social systems (and
many physical and biological systems) are open. Empirical invariance
does not exist in such systems, andseemingly probabilistic invariances
may be causally unrelated (Harre and Secord, 1973; Bhaskar, 1979;
Collier, 1994; Patomaki, 1996; Jervis, 1997). [As physicists readily
admit, prediction in open systems, especially non-linear ones, is
difficult, and often impossible]{.underline}. [The risk in saying that
social scientists can \'predict\' the value of variables in past history
is that the value of these variables is already known to us, and thus we
are not really making predictions]{.underline}. Rather, we are trying to
convince each other of the logic that connects a statement of theory to
an expectation about the value of a variable that derives from that
theory. As long as we can establish the parameters within which the
theoretical statement is valid, which is a prerequisite of generating
expectations in any case, this \'theory-testing\' or \'evaluating\'
activity is not different in a logical sense when done in past or future
time.5

[[Any existential risk evokes problems that it shares with all other

[Someone]{.underline} on the physics-disaster committee should know what
the term \"existential risk\" means[; should possess whatever skills the

physicist. [**[The domain-specific expertise and the expertise

overconfidence result - a casual description, online, with no
references. I was so incredulous that I contacted the author to ask if
this was a real experimental result. (He referred me to the edited
volume *Judgment Under Uncertainty*.) I should not have had to stumble
across that reference by accident. Someone should have warned me, as I
am warning you, that [this is knowledge needful to a student of

And I said to him: \"Would you advise a friend to argue his own court

difficult, but I think it had honestly never occurred to him that
physics might be as difficult as lawyering.

**We are only responsible for the action of the plan.**

**Harris '8** (Alex; 8/15/8; J.D. Stanford University, B.A. from Harvard
University, Practicing Appellate and Constitutional Law at Gibson, Dunn
& Crutcher LLP, former Adjunct Analyst at The Competitive Enterprise
Institute; Philosopher's Corner, "Philosopher\'s Corner: The Principle
of Intervening Action,"
<https://cei.org/blog/philosophers-corner-principle-intervening-action)>
\*PIA = Principle of Intervening Action\*

Gewirth takes the position that [[we are **solely responsible**
for]{.mark} the morality of **[our own actions]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
two senses. [First, only we are responsible for]{.underline} the [acts
we commit, **even if someone else\'s action** caused us to
act]{.underline} as we did. (For example, if a woman\'s husband cheated
on her and she, upon finding out, grew enraged and killed his lover,
she - not he - would bear sole responsibility.) [Second, we are only
responsible for our]{.underline} own [actions, [**even if they lead** to
other actions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [[we have a **preeminent
duty** to never act immorally]{.mark}, even if]{.underline} doing [so
would preclude others from]{.underline} taking even [more immoral
actions]{.underline}. Gewirth contends that [[never
violating]{.underline}]{.mark} the negative [[rights]{.mark} of another
[\"is]{.mark}]{.underline} an obligation [[so
fundamental]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[it **cannot be
overridden**]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[to prevent]{.mark} evil
[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline} from befalling some persons.\" He
clarifies with an example. Imagine that a group of terrorists kidnaps a
woman and offers her son a choice: he must torture his mother or they
will blow up a city with a nuclear weapon. Gewirth argues that the son
has a primary duty to not violate the rights of his mother, whereas he
is not the actor who is blowing up the city - the terrorists are the
moral agents responsible for that action, not the son. If the son had
the choice, he would pick neither. His duty is to never violate rights;
the only way to fulfill this is to not torture his mother. Gewirth
argues: \"It would be unjustified to violate the mother\'s right to life
in order to protect the rights to life of the many other residents of
the city. For [[rights **cannot be**]{.mark} **justifiably protected**
[by violating another]{.mark}]{.underline} right.\" [[PIA is the only
**consistent**]{.mark}**, justifiable**]{.underline} moral
[[theory]{.mark} of consequences. [First]{.mark}]{.underline}, one
should note that [[only PIA sets a **non-arbitrary limit** on]{.mark}
the string of [effects]{.mark} that can factor into]{.underline} the
moral [calculation. PIA says]{.underline} that **[[no
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}** of other actions [can
[count]{.mark}; the only other]{.underline} non-arbitrary [standard says
that all consequences]{.underline} in the chain must
[count]{.underline}. One cannot claim that I am responsible for only,
say, the first four other actions resulting from my action. One must
either consider only my actions or all resulting actions. Thus,
[if]{.underline} the [destruction]{.underline} of the city by terrorists
actually [ended up preventing more]{.underline} rights [violations
by]{.underline}, say, [staving off a Malthusian population
crunch]{.underline} that would result in mass starvation and world war,
then [the consequentialist position has to **endorse the terrorists\'
action**. [Consequentialists]{.mark}]{.underline} have to [[count
**every effect**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the chain, [even in the
absurdly far-off]{.underline} future, [to determine whether an action is
moral. This]{.underline} fact, of course, does not by itself constitute
a reason to reject consequentialism in favor of PIA, but it does
[suggest]{.underline} that [PIA is the **only reasonable**]{.underline}
interpretation of the [requirement of non-consequentialism]{.underline}.
It also suggests an implausible feature of consequentialism. I went on
to demonstrate how the libertarian principle of self-ownership supports
PIA and why people cannot be responsible for all effects of their
actions: [Since we are born owning]{.underline} ourselves and [nothing
else]{.underline}, controlling our mind and body and no one else\'s, [it
makes **perfect sense**]{.underline} that [we should be responsible for
only]{.underline} the [actions]{.underline} that [**we ourselves
commit**. [Some]{.mark}]{.underline} could [[argue]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [[we should be responsible for]{.mark} the [results]{.mark} of
these actions. [PIA states]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[[we
are]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If a person gets a wrecking ball and knocks
over a building, which then falls and crushes twenty people, [the person
is]{.underline} to some degree [responsible for]{.underline} those
[**results**. [But]{.mark}]{.underline} this is
[[not]{.underline}]{.mark} the [case [if **someone else**]{.mark}**\'s
action [intervenes]{.mark}**[, because another]{.mark}]{.underline}
moral [agent [is the]{.mark}]{.underline} more [[**proximate cause**
of]{.mark} the effects; she]{.underline} has [stepped into the **line of
causation**]{.underline} to take the moral responsibility. When you act
upon a rock that you hurl at an enemy\'s face, [you are responsible
for]{.underline} the [effects]{.underline} of the rock [for two reasons:
first, you are using force]{.underline} upon the rock;
[secondly]{.underline}, the rock has [no agency over]{.underline} the
[effects]{.underline} it causes. The rock, by the fact that it has no
agency of its own, is merely your tool, an extension of your agency.
[But neither of these]{.underline} reasons [holds for]{.underline} using
non-coercive measures that result in [a person\'s action. As long as one
does not]{.underline} use coercion to [compel another]{.underline} to
commit a rights-violating action, [one has not reduced that]{.underline}
other [person\'s agency]{.underline}. Possessing full agency, [[the
person is]{.mark} **morally [responsible]{.mark}** [for the **totality**
of her actions]{.mark}]{.underline}; thus [no one else can assume **any
portion** of]{.underline} that [responsibility. You are not responsible
for]{.underline} anyone else\'s [free actions and no one]{.underline}
else is responsible [for yours]{.underline}. If the son were somehow
partially responsible for the terrorists blowing up the city, that would
necessarily diminish, by whatever fraction of responsibility the son
assumed, the terrorists\' responsibility for that action. They would not
be wholly responsible, because the son had caused their action. But this
must not be the case; the terrorists must be held totally responsible
for the destruction of the city. [[Consequentialists ask,
\"Which]{.underline}]{.mark} set of [rights-[violations do you
endorse]{.mark}]{.underline}: the torture of the mother, or the deaths
of the millions?\" Gewirth responds that [[PIA endorses
**neither**]{.mark}. PIA gives]{.underline} the terrorists **[complete
responsibility]{.underline}** for their actions, [and emphatically
condemns]{.underline} them, [in a way that **no other position** is
capable]{.underline} of. [Only PIA is]{.underline} capable of [giving
rights]{.underline} their [**supreme status** by
proclaiming]{.underline} that [they may never be violated]{.underline}
for any reason, [including preventing future]{.underline}
rights-[violations]{.underline}.

**Utilitarian balancing [can't justify]{.underline} continued violence.
One-percent risk of a solvency deficit to a counterplan infinitely

VI\. Concluding Observations

[To understand that education is a human right is to understand that the
[problems of education]{.mark} in this country [and]{.mark} the proposed
[solutions are]{.mark} **inextricably [interconnected]{.mark}**
[with]{.mark} issues of [morality, justice and values]{.mark}.
Fundamental issues of human rights, justice and morality must be
addressed and resolved before any reconstruction of the educational
system is attempted. [What is excused as misfortune must be **recognized
as injustice** and what has been dismissed as the status quo must be
traced to the action or inaction of the unjust]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[A just society]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly one with the
economic resources of the United States, [[would not choose to reject
any]{.mark} of its [children]{.mark}. A just society would treat each of
its children as an \"unprecedented wonder\"]{.underline} n243 [and would
be committed to enabling them to realize their potential for living a
full human life]{.underline}. n244 [Each child would be recognized for
the person he is; his presence on this earth would be treated as an
\"unconditional blessing.\"]{.underline} n245

[This recognition and celebration of life is the core principle of human
rights]{.underline}. It was recognized by a Freedmen\'s Bureau
commissioner who urged that the freed people in the Bureau\'s schools be
\"treated as men with immortal souls rather than as beasts of burden or
machines for pulling cotton.\" n246 More than 100 years later, Thomas
Sowell similarly noted that the \"only common denominator among the
successful schools \[in the black community/ghetto\] was that the
students were treated like human beings and everything was geared to the
expectation that they would succeed.\" n247 The children understood that
they were important in and of themselves. n248

\[\*952\] [Conscious choices violate the human rights of certain
children. Yet [human rights constitute **the most essential moral
claims**]{.mark} that all human beings can assert]{.underline}. n249
[[They confirm]{.mark} the sacredness of human beings and their
**[intrinsic dignity]{.mark}**. Human rights are entitlements.
[The]{.mark} great [disparity in]{.mark} the amount of [money spent for
some]{.mark} compared to that spent on the education of other people\'s
children [is a measure of **how**]{.mark} **little [certain children are
valued]{.mark} as human beings**]{.underline}. As a result, [a message
is sent that those children \"deserve to be neglected \[and\] to be
surrounded by a blatant lack of respect.\"]{.underline} n250

[A solution to this problem will require the problem solvers to know
what it is like for children to grow up rejected and shunned by the
dominant society, what it means and does to them, and whether they think
they deserve to be treated that way]{.underline}. As Kozol asks, \"what
is it that enables some of them to pray? When they pray, what do they
say to God?\" n251 Other previously ignored questions must also be
answered:

> how certain people hold up under terrible ordeal, how many more do
> not, how human beings devalue other people\'s lives, how numbness and
> destructiveness are universalized, how human pity is at length
> extinguished and the shunning of the vulnerable can come in time to be
> perceived as natural behavior \... . How does a nation deal with those
> whom it has cursed? n252

Others wonder about the impact of long-standing devaluation on both the
children devalued and on those responsible for that devaluation: \"after
all that has happened, in history and in our own time, can black people
still be seen with empathy and without sentimentality as human beings
with aspirations and potential that deserve fulfillment?\" n253 Andrew
Hacker maintains that persuading Americans to care about children other
than their own is imperative because indigent children are looked upon
as a burden. n254

Where is the public indignation at the abuse of innocent children who
have done nothing wrong? Despite a \"reverence for fair play\" and a
\"genuine distaste for loaded dice\" in the United States, Kozol
maintains \[\*953\] that in the realms of education, health care and
inheritance of wealth, fairness is not evident. n255 In those areas,
Kozol says, \"we want the game to be unfair and we have made it so; and
it will likely so remain.\" n256 If our motives can be judged most
accurately by our actions or inaction, Hacker and Kozol\'s perceptions
are on the mark. Many in our country, including children, are isolated
in helplessness while others choose to isolate themselves by their own
selfishness. [It is a [selfishness]{.mark} that [consists not
only]{.mark} of an [unwillingness to redistribute resources]{.mark} to
others in need, [but]{.mark} also [of a **deliberate perpetuation
of**]{.mark} **an [unfair distribution]{.mark} of the benefits of the
educational system** which secures advantages in society]{.underline}.

Americans pride themselves on their morality. The \"American Creed\" is
the ideological foundation of the nation, encompassing the ideals of the
inherent dignity of the individual human being, and of the fundamental
equality of all, as well as \"inalienable\" rights to freedom, justice
and fair opportunity. All of these ideals are reconciled within the
framework of the common good. These are the elements of a democratic
creed that, although pre-dating the United States, represents the
\"national conscience.\" n257 The creed is the basis for the realization
of the \"American Dream,\" which in addition to being a dream of wealth
has also \"been a dream of being able to grow to fullest development as
a man and woman\" to benefit \"the simple human being of any and every
class.\" n258

In 1944, Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal characterized U.S. race
relations as an \"American Dilemma\": the moral dilemma of the disparity
between ideals and actual behavior. n259 It is tragic that any such gap
remains after all of these years. Yet, it is not unrealistic to believe
in and work for change unless those with economic and political
influence are completely hypocritical. The civil rights and women\'s
rights movements in this country are among the precedents that justify
some optimism and hope.

[[No matter how discouraging the prospects for]{.mark} fundamental
[change]{.mark} in the educational system, [it would be]{.mark} even
more **[irresponsible to fail to act]{.mark}**]{.underline}. n260 [If
human rights violations are to end, then the moral choices
that]{.underline} \[\*954\] [underlie those violations and the values
that influence those moral choices must be changed]{.underline}. n261
[Without that change, we will continue merely to remodel on a faulty
foundation. Despite commentaries about the futility of trying to reverse
these choices, fundamental change **is** possible and one of the many
reasons for that change is the ability of challengers to redefine a
policy issue]{.underline}.

[Acceptance of [education as a]{.mark} human [right changes our]{.mark}
understanding of the essential purpose of education and requires a
fundamental and thorough redefinition of education policy. The primary
[objective]{.mark} of [education]{.mark} policy [would become]{.mark}
compliance with the rights of all children to the type and quality of
education [needed to live full human lives **rather
than**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as now]{.underline}, **[conceiving of
education as merely [a]{.mark} utilitarian [instrument for maximizing
payoff]{.mark} for those who invest in it]{.underline}** - or for those
who can afford the type of education most likely to provide the greatest
return on investment. It puts into sharp historical and cultural
perspective the fact that since the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights in 1945, nations from all over the world have recognized
education as a human right while our own Supreme Court does not consider
education to be even a constitutional right.

It may be that domestic human rights issues go unacknowledged by the
public because of the myth that the United States is a paragon of human
rights observance. As human rights become more important in
international relations, this country is vulnerable to charges of
hypocrisy for attempting to maintain a \"facade of championing human
rights when it does not protect the rights of its own citizens.\" n262
Despite the rhetoric about the sanctity of human rights, hypocritical or
not, it is likely that most people in this country comprehend human
rights only in the context of such egregious human evils as genocide or
systematic torture. Beyond that there is little understanding of the
meaning, significance and implications of human rights.

All education systems want to produce a certain kind of human being, and
values have always been an essential and unavoidable part of education.
Ironically, therefore, the redefinition of education policy \[\*955\]
issue requires education. From the time they start school, children need
to learn about human rights and to respect the human rights and dignity
of all people regardless of race, color, language, gender, or faith.
Human rights education needs to occur at all levels from elementary
school through college or university.

Promotion of internationally recognized human rights principles emerging
in international law, moreover, would educate our judiciary as well as
the public. These international human rights principles pose a growing
challenge to what some experts consider the isolation and provincialism
of U.S. courts. n263 Given the influence of values on judicial
decision-making, these human rights principles provide an important
source of law for U.S. courts to use in the interpretation of the
Constitution, including filling in the gaps in constitutional
protections. To ignore those principles is to express indifference to
them and expresses a willingness to put the United States in direct
conflict with international law. n264

No attempt is made here to spell out the details of a curriculum or the
content of specific course subjects needed to enable people to live full
human lives. However, [a quality education is about reading, writing,
computing, communicating, imagining, thinking, reasoning, creating,
participating, questioning, analyzing, challenging, judging, and
changing. It is about the unprecedented wonder of each and every human
being, the rights and duties of each other. It is about history and
heritage as well as partaking in cultural stories and heritage. It is
about sharing all the intellectual adventures at the heart of
civilization. It is about morals and ethics and the content of
character. It is also about participating in decisions that affect
one\'s life]{.underline}.

A quality education must not be indoctrination in an
\"Aren\'t-We-Americans-Just-Dandy curriculum\" as Theodore and Nancy
Sizer called it. n265 Education needs to have a global perspective with
an understanding of all peoples, their cultural heritage, values,
problems and ways of life. [Education needs to be about human
solidarity, respect for human dignity, the equal rights of all human
beings, and justice and equality for all people]{.underline}.

[There is **[no reason]{.mark}** that [can justify]{.mark} the
[perpetuation of]{.mark} human rights [violations to education]{.mark}:
not transparent appeals to the democratic principle of local control of
education (it would be a perverted]{.underline} \[\*956\] [democracy
that commits or tolerates violations of the human rights of children);
[not]{.mark} a state\'s use of [local control as an excuse]{.mark}
rather than as a justification [for interdistrict
inequality;]{.mark}]{.underline} n266 [and [not]{.mark} the
[federal]{.mark} government\'s [evasion]{.mark} of the duty by [hiding
behind the myth]{.mark} that [education is]{.mark} exclusively [a state
and local matter]{.mark} in this country]{.underline}. n267

**[A just society would not tolerate anything less than the end of these
violations of our children\'s human right to education]{.underline}**.
Of course, [our willingness to end these violations depends on **the
type of a society we desire** and **what kind of people we want to
be**]{.underline}.

**This logic of utilitarianism culminates in extinction**

[According to]{.underline} Franz [Hinkelammert]{.underline}, [[the West
has]{.underline}]{.mark} repeatedly [[been under the illusion that it
should]{.mark} **try to [save humanity by destroying part of
it]{.mark}**[. This is]{.mark} a salvific and [sacrificial
destruction,]{.mark} committed in the **name of the need to radically
materialize all the possibilities opened up by a given social and
political reality** over which it is supposed to have total power. [This
is how it was in **colonialism**,]{.mark} with [the **genocide of
indigenous peoples**,]{.mark} and [**the African slaves**.]{.mark} This
is how it was in the **period of [imperialist struggle]{.mark}**[s,
which caused **millions of deaths**]{.mark} in two world wars and many
other colonial wars. This is how it was in [**Stalinism**, with the
**Gulag** and]{.mark} in [**Nazism**, with the
**holocaust**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} And now today, [this is how
it is in [neoliberalism,]{.mark} with [the **collective sacrifice of the
periphery**]{.mark} and **even the semiperiphery of the world
system.**]{.underline} With the war against Iraq, it is fitting to ask
whether what is in progress is a new genocidal and sacrificial illusion,
and what its scope might be. [It is above all appropriate to ask if
[the]{.mark} new [illusion will]{.mark} not herald the radicalization
and the ultimate perversion of the western illusion]{.underline}:
**[[destroy]{.mark}ing [all]{.mark} of [humanity]{.mark} in the illusion
of saving it.]{.underline}** [[Sacrificial genocide arises from]{.mark}
a totalitarian illusion that is manifested in [the belief that there are
no alternatives to the present]{.mark}-day [reality]{.mark} and that the
problems and **difficulties confronting it arise from failing to take
its logic of development to its ultimate consequences.**]{.underline}
[[If there is]{.mark} unemployment, [hunger and death in the Third
World, this is n]{.mark}o[t the result of market
failures]{.mark}]{.underline}[;]{.mark} instead, [[it]{.mark} i[s the
outcome of]{.mark} the [market laws not having been fully
applied.]{.mark}]{.underline} [If there is
[terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [this [is not due to the
violence]{.mark} of the conditions [that generate it; it]{.mark} i[s
due]{.mark}, rather, [to]{.mark} the fact [that total violence has not
been employed to physically eradicate all]{.mark} terrorists and
[potential terrorists.]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[This political logic is
based on the supposition of total power and knowledge]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [on the radical [rejection of
alternatives]{.mark}]{.underline}[; [it is
ultra-conservative]{.underline}]{.mark} [in that it aims [to infinitely
reproduce the status quo.]{.mark}]{.underline} Inherent to it is the
notion of the end of history. During the last hundred years, [[the West
has experienced three versions of this logic]{.underline},]{.mark} and,
therefore, seen three versions of the end of history:
[[Stalinism]{.underline}]{.mark}, with its logic of insuperable
efficiency of the plan; [[Nazism]{.underline}]{.mark}, with its logic of
racial superiority; [[and neolib]{.mark}eralism]{.underline}, with its
logic of insuperable efficiency of the market. The first two periods
involved the destruction of democracy. The last one trivializes
democracy, disarming it in the face of social actors sufficiently
powerful to be able to privatize the State and international
institutions in their favour. I have described this situation as a
combination of political democracy and social fascism. One current
manifestation of this combination resides in the fact that intensely
strong public opinion, worldwide, against the war is found to be
incapable of halting the war machine set in motion by supposedly
democratic rulers. [At all these moments]{.underline}, [a **death
drive**, a catastrophic heroism]{.underline}, [predominates, **the idea
of a looming collective suicide**, **only preventable by the massive
destruction of the other**.]{.underline} Paradoxically, [the broader the
definition of the other and the efficacy of its destruction, the **more
likely collective suicide becomes**. In its sacrificial genocide
version, neoliberalism is a mixture of market radicalization,
neoconservatism and Christian fundamentalism.]{.underline} **[Its death
drive takes a number of forms, from [the idea of \"discardable
populations\"]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} [referring to citizens of
the Third World not capable of being exploited as workers and consumers,
to **[the concept of \"collateral damage\"]{.mark} ,** to refer to the
deaths, as a result of war, of thousands of innocent
civilians]{.underline}. The last, catastrophic heroism, is quite clear
on two facts: according to reliable calculations by the Non-Governmental
Organization MEDACT, in London, between 48 and 260 thousand civilians
will die during the war and in the three months after (this is without
there being civil war or a nuclear attack); the war will cost 100
billion dollars, enough to pay the health costs of the world\'s poorest
countries for four years. [Is it possible to fight this death
drive?]{.underline} We must bear in mind that, historically,
**[[sacrificial destruction has always been linked to]{.mark} the
[economic pillage of natural resources and]{.mark} the [labor]{.mark}
force, [to the imperial design of radically changing the terms of
economic]{.mark}, social, [political]{.mark} and cultural [exchanges in
the face of falling efficiency rates postulated by]{.mark} the
[maximalist logic]{.mark} of the totalitarian illusion in
operation.]{.underline}** It [is as though hegemonic
powers]{.underline}, [both when they are on the rise and when they are
in decline, repeatedly go through times of primitive accumulation,
legitimizing the most shameful violence in the name of futures
where]{.underline}, by definition, **[there is no room for what must be
destroyed]{.underline}**. In today\'s version, the **[period of
primitive accumulation consists of combining neoliberal economic
globalization with the globalization of war. The machine of democracy
and liberty turns into a machine of horror and
destruction.]{.underline}**
