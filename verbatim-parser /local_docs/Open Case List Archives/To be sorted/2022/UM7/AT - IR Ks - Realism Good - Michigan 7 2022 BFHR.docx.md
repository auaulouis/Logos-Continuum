What is the purpose (or scholarly function) of ascribing rationality?
Two aims are plain: describing/explaining or prescribing (wherein the
actor or act either is, or ought to be, rational). Stein (1999) observes
a curious shift: "What started as a normative enterprise has become a
positive one. [Tools]{.underline} once [created to improve]{.underline}
the quality of otherwise [**imperfect human decision making** are now
being used to explain **choice**]{.underline}" (p. 212). But this trend
is more intricate. In principle, many contemporary RCT scholars agree
that "rational-choice theory is first and foremost normative. It tells
us what we ought to do in order to achieve our aims as well as possible"
(Elster, 1989: 3). Still, in practice, RCT scholarship abounds in
descriptive and explanatory analyses (Hampsher-Monk and Hindmoor, 2010;
Lovett, 2006).

The **[descriptive-prescriptive schism]{.underline}** should not
[obfuscate]{.underline} rationality's third purpose:
[rationality]{.underline} "**[as if]{.underline}**" [it were
real]{.underline}. I refer to this as [subjunctive
rationality]{.underline}. It is pervasive in RCT, especially in formal
modeling (Morton, 1999). Accordingly, [actors]{.underline} "[behave as
if they were seeking]{.underline} rationally [to maximize their
**expected returns**]{.underline}," much [like]{.underline} "the
[density of leaves around a tree]{.underline}" is
[determined]{.underline} "[as if each leaf **deliberately sought** to
maximize]{.underline} the amount of [sunlight it receives]{.underline},
given the position of its neighbors, as if it knew the physical laws
..." --- this subjunctive "formula is accepted because it works," not
because it is a truthful account of reality (Friedman, 1953: 21,19,18;
cf. Nagel, 1963). On a larger scale, [decisions]{.underline} may then be
[aggregated]{.underline} in order [to understand **collective actions**
as if they were decided by **rational individuals**]{.underline}, even
when it is not so (Satz and Ferejohn, 1994: 75).

Subjunctive rationality is neither descriptive nor prescriptive, neither
objective nor subjective. Depending on its specific actual usage, it may
be false, probable, indeterminate, or true. Subjunctive rationality
offers important benefits. It fosters creative puzzles and theorization,
otherwise hard to conceive. Its employment may moreover be predictive
and, if correlative to desired goals, make for prescriptive claims. But
these potential benefits of [subjunctive rationality]{.underline} do not
change the fact that it [is not descriptive]{.underline}, [let alone
**explanatory**]{.underline}: "'[As-if]{.underline}' [explanations do
not **actually explain** anything]{.underline}" (Elster, 2007: 25; see
also Macdonald, 2003). [Postulating subjunctive rationality as
explanatory]{.underline} may [commit]{.underline} the [argumentum ad
consequentiam **logical fallacy**]{.underline}: [deriving]{.underline}
an [argument from **desirable or undesirable**
consequences]{.underline}. Fall, however desirable, is not caused by the
leaves' rationality.

This [fallacy lurks in **FPA**]{.underline}, for while the rational
actor model implicitly follows RCT's clear preference for either
subjunctive or prescriptive rationalities (Allison and Zelikow, 1999: 3,
24), [FPA's explanandum]{.underline} is usually very real and concrete,
[enticing]{.underline} the [use of descriptive]{.underline} (and
explanatory) [rationality]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, as game
theorist Herbert Gintis (2009) rightly insists, "[**rational actor
model** applies to **choice situations** where ambiguities are
**absent**]{.underline}, the choice set is clearly delineated, and the
payoffs are unmediated," and not to complex "deliberative choices,"
which forms the crux of FPA (p. 237).

### IR --- AT: Conflict Data

#### Conflict data is a [joke]{.underline}.

Illustrative Application: Predicting International Conflict

We now endeavor to demonstrate as many of the advantages of predictive
models discussed above as possible within the confines of a single
example. We attempt the [prediction of **violent international
conflict**]{.underline}, something [**notoriously hard** to
predict]{.underline}, and consider what predictive modeling can teach us
about this process.

5.1 The paucity of predictive models of interstate conflict

[Empirical analysis]{.underline} in conflict processes research
[relies]{.underline} almost [exclusively on **explanatory
modeling**]{.underline}, [typically using regression]{.underline}.
Predictive models, which do not necessarily aim to operationalize a
causal theory, are then often seen as the tools of applied scientists or
policy analysts rather than of the basic, explanatory science in which
we typically engage (Schneider, Gleditsch, and Carey 2010, 2011). It is
perhaps not surprising then that [there is **little predictive work** in
this field]{.underline} and what does exist is relatively recent.

Beck, King, and Zeng (2000) touched off the contemporary debate on
predictive models for conflict with a study that uses a [**neural
network** approach]{.underline}, which [predicts 17% of
conflicts]{.underline}, [compared to **0%** by a **conventional logistic
regression**]{.underline}. This study led to much debate over the
utility of restricting samples to only dyads that had a reasonable
chance of conflict in the first place, and even sparked some interest in
neural networks (which we discuss further below), but failed to produce
a substantial literature on predictive models for conflict. In one of
the few studies of conflict prediction that followed Beck, King, and
Zeng (2000), Ward, Siverson, and Cao (2007) use a Bayesian,
Hierarchical, Bilinear, Mixed-Effects model stratified by time to gain
an improvement in out-of-sample prediction, again over a fairly standard
logistic regression; in this case, the one originally proposed by Oneal
and Russett (1999). The model offers a substantial improvement in
predictive ability over logit, but does not compare the performance of
its method directly to that used by Beck, King, and Zeng (2000).

One reason the predictive literature on international conflict is so
sparse may be that the [structure of]{.underline} the [conflict data is
such that predictive modeling is **difficult**]{.underline} with
existing technology. For example, [time-series approaches]{.underline}
to prediction, well established in both economics and political science,
are [difficult to apply]{.underline} to [data that span **every possible
conflictual relationship** in the world]{.underline} over time.
None-the-less, there has been a recent increase in predictive work on
other conflict processes, including civil wars (Rost, Schneider, and
Kleibl 2009; Ward, Greenhill, and Bakke 2010), transnational terrorism
(Desmarais and Cranmer 2011), and single-conflict timeseries analyses
(Pevenhouse and Goldstein 1999; Schrodt and Gerner 2000; Brandt,
Freeman, and Schrodt 2011; Schneider 2012).

### IR --- AT: Science

#### IR is not a science.

**[Is]{.underline}** the discipline of International Relations **[(IR) a
'science']{.underline}**? Its 'scientific' credentials have long
concerned proponents and detractors. As Ronald Rogowski's claim in the
epigraph suggests, [the hankering after an]{.underline} '[elegant
science of international politics']{.underline} [has]{.underline}
virtually [become a 'dream' to which]{.underline} his and subsequent
[generations of IR scholars have succumbed]{.underline}. Belying this
dreaming is a question whether IR's social-scientific inquiry can ever
approximate that of the natural sciences. [Perceiving the natural
sciences to be an 'exact science']{.underline}, cohorts of [IR students
have been developing 'powerful']{.underline} and 'parsimonious' [models
for the explanation]{.underline} and understanding of international
politics. [Take the '**balance of power'**]{.underline}, for instance.
[Its aim is to ascertain]{.underline} the existence of [a]{.underline}
particular [**regularity** in world affairs]{.underline} -- [parity
between adversaries]{.underline}. [Borrowing the notion]{.underline} [of
**equilibrium** from **the natural sciences**]{.underline}, [the balance
of power explains]{.underline} international [order]{.underline} as a
regulating mechanism [motivated by the **natural desire**]{.underline}
[of states for survival.]{.underline}

In this way, [IR has tended to **propound explanations** premised
on]{.underline} assumptions of [predictability rooted in the conviction
that]{.underline} international [life is a closed system]{.underline},
changing [in a gradual manner and following **linear
trajectories**]{.underline}, which can be elicited [through]{.underline}
[discrete]{.underline} assessments of [dependent and **independent
variables**]{.underline}. [What IR intends to]{.underline}
[produce]{.underline} in this way [is a nearly mechanistic]{.underline}
model of international politics [that is]{.underline} [perceived to be
as rigorous]{.underline} and robust [as the]{.underline} one of the
[natural sciences]{.underline}. In recent years, the simplification and
reductionism underpinning this 'dream' of a scientific IR have come
under severe criticism from different quarters. In fact,
[some]{.underline} -- such as John G. Ruggie -- [have made the point
that the discipline needs to wake]{.underline} up [from this 'deep
Newtonian slumber]{.underline}', [if it is to have any bearing on the
real world]{.underline} of international politics. The three books under
review actively contribute to this decentring project by advancing the
'complexification' of IR. The notion of complexification entails
different things for different authors, but what all of them share is
some form of engagement with the complexity paradigm of the philosophy
of science.3

[Originating in the natural sciences]{.underline}, the
[complexity]{.underline} paradigm [challenges the Newtonian]{.underline}
[view of an orderly world and suggests]{.underline} that [global
interactions occur in a non-linear fashion.]{.underline} Consequently,
[the outcomes]{.underline} of such interactions [are difficult to
infer,]{.underline} let alone to predict. In this respect, the
proponents of the complexification of IR have noted that [while the
'hard' sciences have become]{.underline} increasingly '[soft' as a
result of]{.underline} their acceptance of [the]{.underline} uncertainty
and [randomness of reality]{.underline}, [**IR has 'hardened'** as a
result of its **suppression of ambiguity**]{.underline}, [disregard for
surprises]{.underline} [and over-investment in its capacity]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} **[forecast]{.underline}** international
**[developments]{.underline}**. Richard Ned Lebow explains this search
for (and commitment to) a predictable worldview of regularities as a
'need for psychological closure', reflecting a desire for definitive
conclusions in support of preferred theoretical assumptions.4 It is in
this context that Damian Popolo asks the pertinent question whether
'scientific IR' is not premised on 'fundamentally misleading notions
about science'.5 In other words, the question that emerges is whether
things appear perplexing because the ken of the mainstream is askew.

In its response to this query, the complexity paradigm reveals that
[Newtonian IR tends]{.underline} [to operate on]{.underline} very
[**little info**rmation]{.underline} (usually a few variables); yet,
this does not prevent it from jumping to conclusions as if it had
knowledge about the whole picture. Such lack of sensitivity to what IR
does not know then underpins a model of the world that is rarely
stumped. As a result, [**when** the accepted framework]{.underline} for
explanation and understanding [fails]{.underline} -- [that
is]{.underline}, [it **faces a question**]{.underline} that **[it cannot
answer]{.underline}** ([for instance]{.underline}, '[Why IR failed to
anticipate the end of the Cold War?]{.underline}') -- [**IR comes up
with a question** that it can answer]{.underline} (for instance, '[Why
the Cold War ended]{.underline}?', answer: '[Because]{.underline} the
Soviet Union could no longer maintain [the balance of power
and]{.underline}, therefore, [without such capability it could
no]{.underline} [longer survive]{.underline} in the international system
and had to implode').

The complexified IR suggests that [by answering the wrong
questions]{.underline}, [Newtonian **IR**]{.underline} [enacts a
**theatre of validity** to generate **explanations**]{.underline} [far
more coherent than reality]{.underline}. Therefore, [the '**incredible
rate of failure**']{.underline} [of]{.underline} the very frameworks
[asserting the 'law-like regularities']{.underline} of international
politics [to anticipate **any**]{.underline} of [the **major events** of
**the past 25 years** should not be surprising]{.underline}.6 The irony
of this situation is not lost on Lebow, who notes that it is the
'commitment to science and scientific methods by international relations
scholars' that provides 'a major impediment to their practice of
science'.7 Thus, this review article assesses the three books under
review in the context of the current state of the art in the emerging
complexity paradigm of IR. Since [this paradigm intends a **complete
rethinking**]{.underline} [of the discipline]{.underline}, the article
will focus [on the complexification of the ontology, epistemology,
methodology and ethics of IR]{.underline}. It has to be stressed at the
outset that while IR students will find all three books under review of
immense interest, their authors reach out to much wider and
interdisciplinary audiences -- thus, the collection edited by Jonathan
Joseph and Colin Wight will be of immense relevance to any of the
subfields of political science, especially international political
economy; Lebow's work has historians, literary theorists and
psychologists in mind; while Popolo's book addresses political theorists
and philosophers.

The Complex Ontology of IR

When he urged IR to come out of its 'degenerating' Newtonian repose,
Ruggie specifically beckoned that the discipline re-engage with the
reality of international life. As he pointed out with chagrin and
frustration, 'the term "ontology" typically draws either blank stares or
bemused smiles' from the IR community.8 The contention is that IR is
plagued by attention blindness -- that is, [because of its]{.underline}
[preoccupation with '**reductive theories**]{.underline} [about "the
logic of **anarchy**]{.underline}"',9 [it cannot discern the
vast]{.underline} and heterogeneous [reality of global
affairs]{.underline}. [Owing to its Newtonian]{.underline}
[commitments]{.underline}, [mainstream IR views reality]{.underline}
'[not as a **continuous flux**]{.underline} ... [but as a]{.underline}
[series of instantaneous "**snapshots**"]{.underline} extracted from
this flux'.10 Thus, as Lebow suggests, [the dominant
accounts]{.underline} of interstate relations [miss the
'open-ended,]{.underline} [**nonlinear nature** of the social
world']{.underline}.11 He insists that the 'confluence and consequences
\[of international politics\] are best [envisaged as a
complex]{.underline}, nonlinear [system']{.underline},12 '[in which
**multiple interrelated**]{.underline} [chains of causation]{.underline}
[have unanticipated interactions and unpredictable
consequences]{.underline}'.13

The ontology of complexity therefore provokes a reckoning with the
multiple possibilities of becoming and becoming-other inherent in the
pervasive ambiguity of global life.14 As Popolo demonstrates, such
commitment reflects the philosophical engagement of Gilles Deleuze and
his insistence on 'the continuous precipitation of new life and new
meaning'.15 Of the three books under review, the volume edited by Joseph
and Wight engages with the issue of ontology most explicitly. [A unique
feature]{.underline} of this collection [is]{.underline} that it offers
[the first]{.underline} comprehensive [account of **Scientific
Realism**]{.underline} (SR) -- one of the strands in the
complexification of IR. SR originates in Roy Bhaskar's work on the
philosophy of science. [Its application to IR is described explicitly as
a 'shift from]{.underline} [**epistemology** to
**ontology'**]{.underline}.16 [The reason for this]{.underline} shift
[is the understanding of reality]{.underline} [as 'stratified' between
the actual, the empirical and the real]{.underline}.17 This
stratification addresses [three]{.underline} of the key ontological
[claims]{.underline} [animating the complexification]{.underline} of IR:
(i) that [the international is **emergent**]{.underline}; (ii) that the
international is **[irreducible]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} and much
more than [its **constituent parts**]{.underline}; [and]{.underline}
(iii) that the international is [subject to **unexpected**
and]{.underline} (often) radical **[transformations]{.underline}** --
that is, small alterations in initial conditions can lead to profound
changes in outcomes.18

In this setting, [SR asserts]{.underline} that [the world]{.underline}
with which IR engages, [**self-organises** in]{.underline} complex and
[**contingent** ways]{.underline}. This observation is also confirmed by
the other two books under review. For instance, [Lebow
frames]{.underline} world [politics as 'an open system]{.underline}
whose outcomes are [sensitive to]{.underline} -- if not always the
result of -- [chance, agency, and confluence']{.underline},19 while
Popolo depicts international life as an 'irreversible' process that
'grows out of complex systems to determine its own rules of
development'.20 Yet, what distinguishes the collection edited by Joseph
and Wight is the confrontation with the 'ontological issue of the
different layering of the social (and natural) world'.21 Conventionally,
[IR has tended to ignore that]{.underline} international
[politics]{.underline} both [inhabit]{.underline} and are embedded in
[complex spaces]{.underline}. In this respect, SR infers one of the
greatest ontological boons of complexified IR -- the recognition of the
'totality'22 of human and non-human interactions in global life.

[Newtonian IR has been]{.underline} exclusively [anthropocentric and
inspired by the 'Enlightenment]{.underline} [belief in a "**makeable
world**"]{.underline}', [according to which human/socio-political
systems]{.underline} (such as civil society, states, international
organisations, etc.) [are both detached from]{.underline} (not only
conceptually, but in practice) and in control of [the 'non-human'
environment]{.underline} in which they occur.23 It is worth pointing out
that such diverse and profound considerations of the complex ontology of
international politics are intended not merely as a criticism of
Newtonian IR, but also as a provocation for re-engaging with the ongoing
and overlapping interconnections animating global life. In fact, the
radical totality of human and non-human interactions has recently been
framed as 'posthuman IR'. Following SR's recognition of the qualitative
and quantitative difference between human and nonhuman systems, [the
**'complex ecologism'**]{.underline} [of 'posthuman IR'
uncovers]{.underline} [that the '**world is not divided**]{.underline}
[into territories in which bounded societies]{.underline} of humans
[live]{.underline} [under singular]{.underline} political [authority
and]{.underline} in the context of [**discrete** natural
**environments'**]{.underline};24 [instead]{.underline}, [global life is
'a **complex interweave**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} numerous
[systems nested]{.underline}, intersected and embedded [in each
other]{.underline}, [all undergoing processes of
**co-evolution**]{.underline} and linked by innumerable feedback
loops'.25 [SR echoes this ontological commitment]{.underline} by
describing world affairs as complex interactions 'between people and
each other, their products, their activities, nature and themselves'.26

An Epistemology for the Complexity of IR

As it can be expected, [the inclusive ontological purview]{.underline}
of the complexity paradigm [presents a number of analytical
challenges]{.underline}. Yet, as the proponents of SR indicate,
[assertions]{.underline} **[about]{.underline}** the appropriate ways of
**[describing the world]{.underline}** [emerge from the]{.underline}
**[ontological assumptions]{.underline}** [of **what the world is**
like]{.underline}.27 Thus, on a meta-theoretical level, [the problem
stems from the realisation that we can never be fully cognisant of
the]{.underline} underlying [mechanisms]{.underline} and processes [of
global life,]{.underline} because this will imply 'knowing the not
knowable'.28 Lebow explains that the contingency of our knowledge
reflects 'the critical importance of non-observables and non-systematic
factors'. This should not, however, be taken as an indication of the
impossibility to provide robust IR interpretation 'rooted in
non-linearity and confluence'.29 In this respect, the acknowledgement of
the limits of our knowledge can become a very productive analytical
point of departure. While all three books under review pay attention to
epistemological concerns, Popolo's endeavour specifically addresses this
aspect of complexified IR. In fact, he ventures that [the **complexity
paradigm** provides a 'genuine **Epistemic Revolution**]{.underline}',
[which renders the Newtonian paradigm 'obsolete']{.underline}.30 [What
is revolutionary]{.underline} about this approach [is not only its
debunking]{.underline} of the common wisdoms of '[scientific
IR']{.underline}, but also its dedication to '"uncertain knowledge",
where uncertainty is regarded and accepted as an intrinsic quality of
nature and not as a result of imperfect knowledge'.31 The suggestion is
that [by focusing]{.underline} mainly [on stable]{.underline},
[equilibrium]{.underline} [configurations]{.underline}, the study of [IR
has remained consciously ignorant of]{.underline} a whole 'new species'
of [discontinuous intuition]{.underline}.32 Thus, by painting itself in
to the Newtonian corner, [the **disciplinary mainstream**
has]{.underline}, on the one hand, evaded the need to recognise that
there are dynamics which are not only unknown, but probably cannot ever
be meaningfully rendered comprehensible, and, on the other hand,
[**stifled endeavours** that]{.underline} [can engage in thoughtful
**deliberation**]{.underline} [and productive management]{.underline}
[of the]{.underline} discontinuities, complexity and [non-linearity of
global life]{.underline}. There are several important features
underpinning such an approach to knowledge.

Firstly, [the **contingency**]{.underline} of both global life and our
ability to know it [makes it **impossible**]{.underline} [to construct
**predictive explanations** of outcomes]{.underline}.
[Lebow]{.underline} is quite emphatic when he [asserts that]{.underline}
['\[v\]ariation across time]{.underline}, [due to]{.underline} the
[changing conditions]{.underline} and human reflection, the [openness of
social systems]{.underline}, [and the complexity of]{.underline} the
[interaction]{.underline} among stipulated causes [make the likelihood
of **predictive theory**]{.underline} -- **[even of a probabilistic
kind]{.underline}** -- **[extraordinarily low']{.underline}**.33 Thus,
the proponents of the complexity paradigm ascertain that [due to its
over-reliance on **predictive theories**]{.underline}, [mainstream IR
'must be **totally discarded**]{.underline}'.34 A further reason for
such rejection is the observation that [the production of
knowledge]{.underline} by Newtonian approaches [has also limited 'what
is open for debate']{.underline}.35 For instance, [due to the
**preoccupation** with **inter-state relations**]{.underline}, [the
discipline produces **foot soldiers**]{.underline} [for]{.underline}
this or that theoretical approach to international [anarchy rather than
students]{.underline} genuinely [interested in observing]{.underline}
[the complex patterns of global]{.underline} affairs.

Secondly, [the unwillingness to engage with the unpredictable becoming
of global life reflects]{.underline} the patterns of [linear
causality]{.underline} that still seem to inform the disciplinary
mainstream. [The issue of 'complex causation']{.underline},36 as Lebow
puts it, [aims to enhance]{.underline} [sensitivity to the unintended
consequences]{.underline} of international interactions. Such effects
defy the conventional focus on purposive behaviour. In fact, [it is
'chance, confluence, and **accident** that]{.underline} often [play a
determining role']{.underline} in global life, [**rather than**
**intentionality**]{.underline}.37 The [complexified IR]{.underline}
thereby [intends to supplant reductive]{.underline} [explanations by
considering]{.underline} the ['conjuncturally determined'
patterns]{.underline} of world affairs.38

Thirdly, [the complexity paradigm critiques]{.underline} the way in
which Newtonian IR has theorised international developments by [focusing
on major events]{.underline}. Lebow indicates that [this bias towards
events-thinking belies the]{.underline} predisposition 'to think of [big
events as having big]{.underline} [causes']{.underline}.39 For instance,
the origins of war are usually attributed either to singular events or
to the resolve of specific individuals, rather than 'the result of
nonlinear confluences'.40 Thus, [the focus on both
spatially]{.underline} and temporally [proximate causes]{.underline}
underpins the blindness to the complex interactions of global life,
which [turns the disciplinary terrain into a **frozen expanse** of
**accidents**]{.underline}. Complexified IR evinces that 'mainstream IR
cannot talk about underlying process, only about systems and units'.
That is why it advocates the abandonment of the 'talk of levels of
analysis in favour of complex, layered assemblies of social
relations'.41

[The three-step]{.underline} of such epistemology for the complexity of
IR [intends simultaneously to rethink]{.underline} and reinvent the
study of international politics. Interestingly, all three books under
review are in agreement that this should be done through the
'demystification of science'.42 [Such demystification entails the
rejection of the Newtonian '**scientific fallacies**]{.underline}'43
[and the acceptance of]{.underline} 'the fact of **[epistemological
realism]{.underline}**: [namely]{.underline}, [that all beliefs are
**socially produced**, so that knowledge is transient]{.underline}, and
neither truth values nor criteria of rationality exist outside of
historical time'.44 It is also worth pointing out that while assisting
the explanation 'of our chaotic and unordered world', [the complexity
paradigm is]{.underline} idiosyncratically [self-reflexive about its own
epistemological investments]{.underline} in a specific understanding of
the international [and readily concedes that 'knowledge sometimes has
the effect of accelerating disorder']{.underline}.45

### Theory --- Offensive Realism

#### Offensive realism is true of [every great power]{.underline}.

**Kaplan '12** --- Robert; a visiting professor at the United States
Naval Academy, consultant to the U.S. Army\'s Special Forces, the United
States Marines, and the United States Air Force. January 2012; "Why John
J. Mearsheimer Is Right (About Some Things)"; *The Atlantic*;
<https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/01/why-john-j-mearsheimer-is-right-about-some-things/308839/>;
//CYang

Mearsheimer reveres both men for their bravery in pointing out unpopular
truths, and throughout his career he has tried to emulate them. Indeed,
in a country that has always been hostile to what realism signifies, he
wears his "realist" label as a badge of honor. "To realism!" he says as
he raises his wineglass to me in a toast at a local restaurant. As
Ashley J. Tellis, Mearsheimer's former student and now, after a stint in
the Bush administration, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment,
later tells me: "[Realism]{.underline} is alien to the American
tradition. It is [consciously amoral]{.underline}, [focused]{.underline}
as it is [on interests rather than]{.underline} on [values in a
**debased world**]{.underline}. But [realism never dies]{.underline},
because it [**accurately reflects** how states **actually
behave**]{.underline}, [behind]{.underline} the [façade of their
**values-based rhetoric**]{.underline}."

Mearsheimer's intellectually combative nature first disturbed the policy
elite in 1988, with the publication of his critical biography, Liddell
Hart and the Weight of History. In it, he asserts that the revered
British military theorist Sir Basil H. Liddell Hart was wrong on basic
strategic questions of the period between the first and second world
wars, especially in his opposition to the use of military force against
the Third Reich, and was a de facto appeaser even after evidence had
surfaced about the systematic murder of Jews. Mearsheimer expected that
his perspective would draw fire from British reviewers who had been
close to Liddell Hart, which it did. "Other political scientists work on
capillaries. John goes for the jugular," notes Richard Rosecrance, a
retired UCLA professor who mentored Mearsheimer in the 1970s.

Mearsheimer certainly triggered a bloodbath with a 2006 article that
became a 2007 book written with the Harvard professor Stephen M. Walt
and dedicated to Huntington, The Israel Lobby and U.S.Foreign Policy,
which alleges that groups supportive of Israel have pivotally undermined
American foreign-policy interests, especially in the run-up to the Iraq
War. Some critics, like the Johns Hopkins University professor Eliot
Cohen, accused Mearsheimer and Walt outright of anti-Semitism, noting
that their opinions had won the endorsement of the white supremacist
David Duke. Many others accused them of providing potent ammunition for
anti-Semites. A former Chicago colleague of Mearsheimer's labeled the
book "piss-poor, monocausal social science."

Last fall, Mearsheimer reenergized his critics by favorably blurbing a
book on Jewish identity that many commentators denounced as grotesquely
anti-Semitic. The blurb became a blot on Mearsheimer's judgment, given
the book's author's revolting commentary elsewhere, and was considered
evidence of an unhealthy obsession with Israel and Jewishness on
Mearsheimer's part.

The real tragedy of such controversies, as lamentable as they are, is
that they threaten to obscure the urgent and enduring message of
Mearsheimer's life's work, which topples conventional foreign-policy
shibboleths and provides an unblinking guide to the course the United
States should follow in the coming decades. Indeed, with the most
critical part of the world, East Asia, in the midst of an unprecedented
arms race fed by acquisitions of missiles and submarines (especially in
the South China Sea region, where states are motivated by old-fashioned
nationalism rather than universal values), and with the Middle East
undergoing less a democratic revolution than a crisis in central
authority, we ignore Mearsheimer's larger message at our peril.

In fact, Mearsheimer is best-known in the academy for his equally
controversial views on China, and particularly for his 2001 magnum opus,
The Tragedy of Great Power Politics. Writing in Foreign Affairs in 2010,
the Columbia University professor Richard K. Betts called Tragedy one of
the three great works of the post--Cold War era, along with Francis
Fukuyama's The End of History and the Last Man (1992) and Huntington's
The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order (1996). And,
Betts suggested, "once China's power is full grown," Mearsheimer's book
may pull ahead of the other two in terms of influence. The Tragedy of
Great Power Politics truly defines Mearsheimer, as it does realism.
Mearsheimer sat me down in his office, overlooking the somber Collegiate
Gothic structures of the University of Chicago, and talked for hours,
over the course of several days, about Tragedy and his life.

ONE OF FIVE children in a family of German and Irish ancestry, and one
of the three who went to service academies, Mearsheimer graduated from
West Point in the bottom third of his class, even after he fell in love
with political science in his junior year. He got his master's degree at
the University of Southern California while stationed nearby in the Air
Force, and went to Cornell for his doctorate. "I disagreed with almost
everything I read, I venerated nobody. I found out what I thought by
what I was against." After stints at the Brookings Institution and
Harvard, he went to the University of Chicago in 1982, and has never
left.

Whereas Harvard, at least in Mearsheimer's telling, is inclined to be a
"government-policy shop" with close ties to Washington, the University
of Chicago comes closer to a "pure intellectual environment." At
Harvard, many students and faculty members alike are on the make,
networking for that first, or next, position in government or the
think-tank world. The environment is vaguely unfriendly to theories or
bold ideas, Huntington being the grand exception that proves the rule.
After all, social-science theories are gross simplifications of reality;
even the most brilliant theories can be right, say, only 75 percent of
the time. Critics unfailingly seize on any theory's shortcomings,
damaging reputations. So the truly ambitious tend to avoid constructing
one.

The University of Chicago, set off the beaten path in a society
dominated by bicoastal elites, explains Mearsheimer, has always
attracted "oddballs" with theories: political scientists who, while
deeply respected, are at the same time not truly embraced by the
American academic power structure. These iconoclasts have included Hans
Morgenthau, as well as Leo Strauss, another German Jewish refugee, whom
some link with neoconservatism. Realists especially have been outsiders
in a profession dominated by liberal internationalists and others to the
left.

For Mearsheimer, academia's hostility to realism is evident in the fact
that Harvard, which aims to recruit the top scholars in every field,
never tried to hire the two most important realist thinkers of the 20th
century, Morgenthau and Kenneth Waltz. But at Chicago, a realist like
Mearsheimer, who loves teaching and never had ambitions for government
service, can propound theories and unpopular ideas, and revel in the
uproar they cause. Whatever the latest group-think happens to be,
Mearsheimer almost always instinctively wants to oppose it ---
especially if it emanates from Washington.

The best grand theories tend to be written no earlier than middle age,
when the writer has life experience and mistakes behind him to draw
upon. Morgenthau's 1948 classic, Politics Among Nations, was published
when he was 44, Fukuyama's The End of History was published as a book
when he was 40, and Huntington's Clash of Civilizations as a book when
he was 69. Mearsheimer began writing The Tragedy of Great Power Politics
when he was in his mid-40s, after working on it for a decade. Published
just before 9/11, the book intimates the need for America to avoid
strategic distractions and concentrate on confronting China. A decade
later, with the growth of China's military might vastly more apparent
than it was in 2001, and following the debacles of the Iraq and
Afghanistan wars, its clairvoyance is breathtaking.

[Tragedy begins with]{.underline} a [**forceful denial** of perpetual
peace in favor of **perpetual struggle**]{.underline}, with [great
powers primed for offense]{.underline}, [because they can **never be
sure** how much military capacity they]{.underline} will [need in order
to **survive over the long run**]{.underline}. Because [every state is
**forever insecure**]{.underline}, Mearsheimer counsels, the [internal
nature of a state is **less important**]{.underline} as a factor in its
international behavior than we think. "[Great powers are like **billiard
balls** that vary **only in size**]{.underline}," he intones. In other
words, Mearsheimer is not one to be especially impressed by a state
simply because it is a democracy. As he asserts early on,
"[Whether]{.underline} China is [democratic and **deeply enmeshed** in
the global economy or autocratic and autarkic]{.underline} will [have
little effect on]{.underline} its [behavior]{.underline}, because
[democracies care about security **as much** as non-democracies
do]{.underline}." Indeed, a democratic China could be more
technologically innovative and economically robust, with consequently
more talent and money to lavish on its military. (A democratic Egypt,
for that matter, could create greater security challenges for the United
States than an autocratic Egypt. Mearsheimer is not making moral
judgments. He is merely describing how states interact in an anarchic
world.)

Face it, Mearsheimer says in his book, quoting the historian James
Hutson: [the world is a]{.underline} "**[brutal]{.underline}**,
[**amoral** cockpit]{.underline}." To make sure readers get the point,
he taps the British scholar E. H. Carr's 1939 book, The Twenty Years'
Crisis, 1919--1939, which takes a wrecking ball to liberal
internationalism. One of its main points: "Whatever moral issues may be
involved, [there is an issue of power]{.underline} which [cannot be
expressed in terms of **morality**]{.underline}." To wit, in the 1990s
we were able to intervene to save lives in the Balkans only because the
Serbian regime was weak and had no nuclear weapons; against a Russian
regime that was at the same time committing incalculable human-rights
violations in Chechnya, we did nothing, just as we did nothing to halt
ethnic cleansing in the Caucasus. [States take up human rights **only
if** doing so does not contradict]{.underline} the [pursuit of
power]{.underline}.

But being a realist is not enough for Mearsheimer; he needs to be an
"[offensive realist]{.underline}," as he calls himself. "Offensive
realism," he writes in Tragedy, "[is]{.underline} like [a **powerful
flashlight** in a dark room]{.underline}": it cannot explain every
action throughout hundreds of years of history, but he [exhaustively
goes through]{.underline} that [history to demonstrate]{.underline} just
[how much it **does explain**]{.underline}. Whereas Hans Morgenthau's
realism is rooted in man's imperfect nature, [Mearsheimer's is
**structural**]{.underline}, and therefore that much more inexorable.
Mearsheimer [cares]{.underline} relatively [little about]{.underline}
what [individual statesmen]{.underline} can achieve, for [the **state of
anarchy** in the international system **simply guarantees**
insecurity]{.underline}. Compared with Mearsheimer, Henry Kissinger and
the late American diplomat Richard Holbrooke --- two men usually
contrasted with each other --- are one and the same: romantic figures
who believe they can pivotally affect history through negotiation.
Kissinger, in fact, has written lush histories of statesmen in A World
Restored: Metternich, Castlereagh and the Problems of Peace 1812--1822
(1957) and Diplomacy (1994), embracing his subjects with charm and
warmth, whereas Mearsheimer's Tragedy is cold and clinical. Kissinger
and Holbrooke care deeply about the contingencies of each situation, and
the personalities involved; Mearsheimer, who was always good at math and
science in school, sees only schemata, even as his own historical
analyses have helped to rescue political science from the purely
quantitative studies favored by others in his field.

Just as Mearsheimer's theory of realism is opposed to Morgenthau's in
being structural, it is also opposed to the structural realism of
Columbia's Waltz in being offensive. Offensive realism posits that
[**s**tatus **quo** powers **don't exist**]{.underline}: [all great
powers are **perpetually** on the offensive]{.underline}, even if
obstacles may arise to prevent them from expanding their territory or
influence.

[What was Manifest Destiny]{.underline}, Mearsheimer asks the reader,
[except offensive realism]{.underline}? "Indeed, the [**U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} was [bent on establishing]{.underline} regional
[hegemony]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} it [was an **expansionist
power** of the first order in the Americas]{.underline}": [acquiring
territory]{.underline} from European powers, massacring the native
inhabitants, and [instigating war with Mexico]{.underline}, in good part
for the sake of security. Mearsheimer details [Japan's record of
aggression in Korea]{.underline}, [China]{.underline},
[Russia]{.underline}, [Manchuria]{.underline}, and the [Pacific Islands
after]{.underline} its [consolidation as a nation-state following
the]{.underline} 19th-century [Meiji Restoration]{.underline}. To
demonstrate that the anarchic structure of the international system, not
the internal characteristics of states, determines behavior, he shows
how [Italy]{.underline}, during the eight decades that it was a great
power, [was equally aggressive under **both** liberal and fascist
regimes]{.underline}: [going after North Africa]{.underline}, [the Horn
of Africa]{.underline}, the [southern Balkans]{.underline},
[southwestern Turkey]{.underline}, [and southern
Austria-Hungary]{.underline}. He characterizes [Germany's]{.underline}
Otto von [Bismarck]{.underline} as an [offensive realist]{.underline}
who [engaged in conquest during his **first nine years**]{.underline} in
office, and then restrained himself for the next 19 years. "In fact,
\[that restraint\] was because Bismarck and his successors correctly
understood that the German army had conquered about as much territory as
it could without provoking a great-power war, which Germany was likely
to lose." But when Mearsheimer picks up the story at the start of the
20th century, Germany is again aggressive, because by now it controls a
larger percentage of the world's industrial might than any other
European state. Behind every assertion in this book is a wealth of
historical data that helps explain why Tragedy continues, as Richard
Betts predicted, to grow in influence.

"[To argue]{.underline} that [expansion is inherently
misguided]{.underline}," Mearsheimer writes, "[implies]{.underline} that
[all great powers over the **past 350 years**]{.underline} have [failed
to comprehend how the international system works]{.underline}. [This
is]{.underline} an **[implausible argument on its face]{.underline}**."
The [problem with]{.underline} the "[moderation is good]{.underline}"
thesis [is]{.underline} that "[it **mistakenly equates**]{.underline}
\[[so-called]{.underline}\] [irrational expansion with military
defeat]{.underline}." But [hegemony]{.underline} has [succeeded many
times]{.underline}. The [Roman Empire in Europe]{.underline}, the
[Mughal Dynasty in]{.underline} the [Indian]{.underline} subcontinent,
and the [Qing Dynasty in China]{.underline} are some of his examples,
even as he mentions how [Napoleon]{.underline}, [Kaiser]{.underline}
Wilhelm II, and Adolf [Hitler]{.underline} all came close to success.
"Thus, the pursuit of regional hegemony is not a quixotic ambition,"
though no state has yet achieved regional hegemony in the Eastern
Hemisphere the way the United States achieved it in the Western
Hemisphere.

The edgiest parts of Tragedy are when Mearsheimer presents full-bore
rationales for the aggression of Wilhelmine Germany, Nazi Germany, and
imperial Japan.

The [German decision]{.underline} to push for war [in 1914
was]{.underline} not a case of wacky strategic ideas pushing a state to
start a war it was sure to lose. It was ... a [**calculated risk**
motivated]{.underline} in large part [by]{.underline} Germany's [desire
to break]{.underline} its [encirclement by the **Triple
Entente**]{.underline}, [prevent]{.underline} the [growth of Russian
power]{.underline}, [and become Europe's hegemon]{.underline}.

As for Hitler, he "did indeed learn from World War I." Hitler learned
that Germany could not fight on two fronts at the same time, and he
would have to win quick, successive victories, which, in fact, he
achieved early in World War II. Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor was a
calculated risk to avoid abandoning the Japanese empire in China and
Southeast Asia in the face of a U.S. embargo on imported energy and
machine tools.

Mearsheimer is no warmonger or militarist. His job as a political
scientist is not to improve the world, but to say what he thinks is
going on in it. And he thinks that [while states **rightly yearn** for a
**values-based foreign policy**]{.underline}, the [reality of the
**anarchic international system** forces them to behave according to
their **own interests**]{.underline}. In his view, either liberal
internationalism or neoconservatism is more likely than offensive
realism to lead to the spilling of American blood. Indeed, because, as
some argue, realism in the classical sense seeks the avoidance of war
through the maintenance of a balance of power, it is the most
humanitarian approach possible. (In this vein, fighting Nazi Germany was
essential because the Nazis were attempting to overthrow the European
balance-of-power system altogether.)
