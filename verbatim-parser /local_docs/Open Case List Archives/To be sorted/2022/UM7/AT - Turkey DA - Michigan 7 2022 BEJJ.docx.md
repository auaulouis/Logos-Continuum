### 2AC -- UQ -- Losing Now

#### The mob is [turning on the Sultan]{.underline}---[rising inflation]{.underline}, [low interest rates]{.underline}, and [currency crisis]{.underline} guarantee [Erdogan's loss]{.underline}.

To cut a long story short, the Islamist tide could not be held back by
the military dam. Eventually, Erdoğan led them to power. He cut the
wings of the military, initiated a rapprochement with the recalcitrant
Kurds and made Islamism the new guiding principle of the country, both
at home and abroad. Out went Kemalism, in came Erdoğanism. In the early
days, this meant moving closer to Europe to avoid yet another military
coup and fairly sound management of the economy. [As war rages between
Russia and Ukraine]{.underline}, [the early era of Erdoğan]{.underline}
seems a [lifetime away]{.underline}. In June, some researchers estimated
[inflation in Turkey to be 160%, more than twice the official estimate
of 79%]{.underline}. The country is also [facing a currency
crisis]{.underline}. In 2021, the [Turkish lira fell by 44% against the
dollar. In 2022, the lira is in freefall, the current account deficit
(imports minus exports) is rising and the budget deficit (expenditures
minus revenues) has reached a record high]{.underline}.
[Millions]{.underline} of workers, young people and pensioners [have
fallen below the poverty line]{.underline}, which is set at \$1,200 a
month for a family of four. While [much of the economic pain was
inevitable given the global economic downturn, some of it is
**self-inflicted**]{.underline}. By stubbornly insisting on cutting
interest rates at a time of soaring inflation, Erdoğan has scored a
spectacular own goal. Elections and Revolutions Depend on the Price of
Bread The [Turkish economy has struggled with its economy]{.underline}
long before Erdoğan. With an oversized military, Turkey spent too much
on defense. The country has long relied on dollar-denominated debt,
which leaves it very exposed to external shocks. As a NATO member and a
frontline state against the erstwhile Soviet Union, Turkey was regularly
bailed out by the US and institutions like the International Monetary
Fund (IMF). Like Pakistan, [Turkey extracted geopolitical rent from the
West]{.underline} and bailouts have been par for the course. Only [last
year, the IMF doled out \$6.3 billion to Turkey.]{.underline} The World
This Week: Sultan Erdogan Tightens Grip on Turkey READ MORE Erdoğan has
been putting a gun to the head of European leaders to wring some cash
out of them. In 2016, the European Commission coughed up over \$6.6
billion (€6 billion) for Turkey to host refugees and not disgorge them
into the EU member states. Like a good bazaar merchant, Erdoğan has
somehow kept the Turkish economy from falling into collapse because the
US, the EU, the IMF and NATO all need Turkey for one reason or another.
It is too important to fail. [Even geopolitical rent and political
blackmail have limits]{.underline}. They [do not yield infinite amounts
of cash or gold. When inflation rises, central banks raise interest
rates so that people **keep their money in the bank** instead of
spending them on goods and services or assets]{.underline}. Inflation is
a regular feature of the Turkish economy. In the 1980s and 1990s prices
soared. Then, the central bank raised interest rates and brought it
under control. [Erdoğan wants his central bank to keep interest rates
low]{.underline}. Some of his key supporters have long been small
businessmen who resent high interest rates. Turkish economists privately
tell this author that [Erdoğan thinks raising interest rates would put a
**spoke in the wheels of the economy**]{.underline}. Like many
politicians who want economic growth, [Erdoğan wants to print money to
achieve it.]{.underline} After all, he is doing what the Federal Reserve
and the European Central Bank did when they printed money through their
policy of quantitative easing. The US and European central banks have
since reversed course in the face of rising inflation. [Erdoğan has held
the fort and pressured his central bank to cut rates instead. This means
there is more money sloshing around in the Turkish economy than
necessary]{.underline}. With oil, food and commodity prices high thanks
to the Russia-Ukraine War, [Erdonomics has sent prices soaring even
further. Turks are scrambling to get rid of liras as fast as they
can]{.underline}. They are buying dollars, properties (prices are up by
182% over the past year), cars, electronics and other consumer goods,
and [even high-risk volatile assets such as overpriced stocks and
cryptocurrencies]{.underline}. Turkey might not be Sri Lanka yet but
[Erdonomics is **causing its economy to collapse.**]{.underline} Over
the last few years, [he has become a **de facto sultan**]{.underline}.
He has built Ak Saray, a pure white palace of 1,000 rooms on 50 acres of
Atatürk Forest Farm, after razing Atatürk's country lodge to the ground.
Hagia Sophia is no longer a museum but a mosque. [Secular Kemalist
Turkey is dead]{.underline}. Istanbul's elites have been defenestrated.
Critics have been castrated. Furthermore [Erdoğan has been able to
project himself as a key leader of the Muslim world and won much
popularity in places like Palestine and Pakistan]{.underline}. Recently,
he even changed Turkey's name to Türkiye. In his 19 years in office,
[Erdoğan]{.underline} has accomplished a lot. He has changed the nature
of the state and the arc of Turkey's destiny. Yet [he is **increasingly
vulnerable.** Turkey]{.underline} may not be Sri Lanka yet but it [is in
turmoil. Elections and revolutions depend on the price of bread.
Erdonomics has **set that on fire**. At some point, the mob might **turn
on the sultan.**]{.underline}

I realized after cutting this that it was from 2019 (oops) but the
warrants are fire.

#### Prefer [long term]{.underline}, [structural factors]{.underline} to [snapshots]{.underline}---

#### AKP's loss in Istanbul mayoral elections signals a [cataclysmic shift]{.underline} against Erdogan---[lagging economy]{.underline}, [corruption]{.underline}, [loss of urban votes]{.underline}, and [disunified party]{.underline} forecast a loss.

For 16 years [Erdogan]{.underline} as prime minister, and then
president, tightened his grip on Turkish politics, proving forecasters
of all hues wrong about his ability to remain in office, including
seeing off an attempted coup d'etat in 2016. He, however, [suffered a
**significant setback** on 23 June.]{.underline} His [party's candidate
in]{.underline} the [crucial mayoral election in Istanbul]{.underline},
Turkey's biggest city, [lost to Ekrem Imamoglu]{.underline}. Indeed, the
[result in a re-run of voting, after Erdogan objected]{.underline} to
the original result in March, [**reconfirmed the first outcome by a much
bigger majority**. AKP]{.underline} had previously [ruled Istanbul for a
quarter of a century. Imamoglu prevailed even in religious precincts of
the city]{.underline}. His healing touch in a climate of confrontation
and divisive politics struck a chord. He [united a disparate
opposition]{.underline}, including drawing in the secular nationalist
Iyi party. Imamoglu can now be deemed to be a [**powerful alternative**
to Erdogan in Turkey's national polity.]{.underline} With the
all-[important metropolis of Istanbul in the fold, opposition parties
will in the foreseeable future control all major urban
areas]{.underline} of the country other than Bursa. This means cities
which collectively account for a distinctly greater part of Turkey's
GDP. This means the [resources AKP had access to and which helped to
catapult it to centre stage will **in all probability
diminish**.]{.underline} "[Whoever wins Istanbul, wins Turkey," Erdogan
asserted]{.underline} and virtually forced the country's election board
to order a re-poll on the basis of unsubstantiated claims of
malpractice. But the [bravado **backfired.** Imamoglu swept the election
by the **biggest margin** in Istanbul's history for 35
years]{.underline}. In the brief period he administered the city before
facing a second ballot, his team [uncovered corruption linked to tenders
worth US \$4 billion awarded to Erdogan's family]{.underline}. AKP
leaders may now also query the seemingly [unpopular centralisation of
authority]{.underline} triggered by the transition to a presidential
system last year. To become [mayor of Istanbul]{.underline} is
considered to be a potential [launchpad to Turkey's
presidency]{.underline}. This was the case with Erdogan. Consequently,
the [defeat of]{.underline} his former prime minister [Binali
Yildirim]{.underline} in the contest has given [rise to speculation that
this could finally be the **beginning of the end**]{.underline} for
Turkey's embrace of orthodox Islam. Erdogan's [hardline on a wide
section of the opposition as a response to the coup may have troubled
his people]{.underline}. It has certainly concerned countries in Europe
and North America. Turkey possessed a relatively independent judiciary.
But [thousands of judges were purged after the coup]{.underline} and
replaced by pro-Erdogan justices. Besides, all [concerned function in an
**atmosphere of tension**.]{.underline} Under Erdogan, Turkey has also
sunk like a stone in international human rights and press freedom
indexes. But as always, more importantly, an **[underperforming
economy]{.underline}** is probably the primary [cause of the public's
discontent]{.underline}. Indeed, Turkey's [economic woes could worsen if
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [carry out]{.underline} its
threat of [economic sanctions]{.underline} because of Ankara placing an
order for the Russian S-400 missiles system, despite being a member of
the western military alliance North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).
The opposition in Turkey has been muzzled ever since Erdogan came to
power. But [Imamoglu's win could have a **cataclysmic
effect**]{.underline}. A national [election is not due until
2023]{.underline}; there's already talk, though, that [Erdogan may not
succeed in holding on that long]{.underline}. Indeed, [Erdogan's
predecessor as president]{.underline} is about to [unveil a breakaway
party.]{.underline} That is bound to split the conservative vote.

### 2AC -- UQ -- Thumper -- Astana

#### [Astana summit]{.underline} either [disproves]{.underline} the [magnitude]{.underline} of the [link]{.underline} or [thumps]{.underline} -- [Erdogan]{.underline} isn't [solely focused]{.underline} on [nationalist interests]{.underline}.

\\\\SYang

[The **last summit** of the **Astana process**]{.underline}, which
started in 2017 between Ankara, Moscow and Tehran and aims to bring
peace to Syria, [was held in **Iran** on **July 19**.]{.underline}
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Russian President Vladimir Putin and
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi met in Tehran.

[The summit was **more important** than ever as it coincided with
**Russia\'s military operation** in **Ukraine**. The eyes of the whole
world were on the **three leaders**.]{.underline}

We witnessed how the Orientalist comments, which were ready and full of
prejudices, appeared in the Western press before the summit. Because at
the summit, which many assumed only focused on the countries\' struggle
for influence over Syria, the three prominent actors of the process
agreed on issues that directly concern the region and Europe, such as
the grain corridor and Syrian refugees.

[And, of course, the **focus of attention** on these issues was thanks
to the **efforts of Erdoğan**. The **Turkish president** did not use his
\"**trump cards**\" only for **Turkey\'s national interests**. As the
leader of a **NATO member** and **EU candidate country**, he also became
an **observer of the interests** of the **Western bloc** with his
**emphasis** on U**.N. resolutions**.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- UQ -- Thumper -- F-16s + Swinland

#### [F-16 talks]{.underline} and [Swinland thump]{.underline}.

\\\\SYang

[US President Joe **Biden** and Turkish President Recep Tayyip
**Erdogan** will discuss the **sale** of **dozens** of new F**-16
warplanes**]{.underline} to modernize Turkey's fleet on the sidelines of
a NATO summit.

[The **meeting** later on **Wednesday in Madrid** comes after **Erdogan
dropped his opposition** to **Swedish** and **Finnish** bids to join
NATO]{.underline}, bringing the alliance one step closer to bolstering
its eastern front with Russia. [That move appears to have **won** him
**US backing** to **strengthen the air force** of Turkey]{.underline},
the second-largest military force in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.  

"[The US **D**epartment **o**f **D**efense **fully supports** Turkey's
**modernization plans** for its **F-16 fleet**]{.underline}," Celeste
Wallander, assistant US defense secretary, told reporters. "These plans
are in the works and they need to be worked through our contracting
processes, but the United States supports Turkey's modernization of its
fighter fleet, because that is the contribution to NATO security and
therefore American security."

[Earlier, both the **US** and **Turkey ruled out** any
**bargaining**]{.underline} on long-standing requests like F-16 fighter
jets [**in exchange** for allowing **Sw**eden and F**inland** to begin
the **process of joining the alliance**.]{.underline}

[The **Turkish leader's decision** to let the **Nordics' NATO bids**
proceed **paved the way** for a **formal meeting** with the **US
president**]{.underline}, according to a senior Biden administration
official. The two leaders are expected to discuss a full range of
issues, the official said, which includes Turkey's long-standing defense
requests.

### 2AC -- UQ -- Thumper -- Rafales

### 1AR -- UQ -- AT: Gen-Z Voter Base

#### [Gen-Z flows aff]{.underline} -- [heavy opposition]{.underline} means it's [impossible]{.underline} for [Erdogan]{.underline} to [win 2023]{.underline}, and [link turn]{.underline} -- they don't like Erdogan's [ultra-nationalist language]{.underline}.

The opinion [**polling data** continues to look **bleak** for **Turkey's
President** Recep Tayyip **Erdogan**]{.underline}, who must face the
electorate by next June at the latest.

Some [**80%** of Turkey's **Gen**eration **Z**]{.underline}---those born
after 2000---[say they **will not vote** for **Erdogan's ruling Justice
and Development Party** (AKP]{.underline}), according to a study by
Gezici Research.

By next June, [Gen Z will represent **11.8%** of Turkey's **voting adult
population**.]{.underline}

"[They **do not approve** of **dictating**, **imperious** or **harsh**
language from **politicians**]{.underline}," Gezici Research chairman
and international security expert Murat Gezici told Turkish

WASHINGTON -- [A **US Congressional amendment** pushed by New Hampshire
Democrat **Chris Pappas** aimed at **preventing the sale of F-16 fighter
jets** to Turkey gives US President **Joe Biden** a way to **get around
it** and **get his way.**]{.underline}

[**Biden wants** the US to **let Turkey buy** the **jets**]{.underline}
at the same time the US has said it supports Greece against provocations
including Turkish fighter jets constantly violating Greek airspace.

[Pappas and a team of other House members opposed to the sale got
approval of the **amendment** barring it but **Biden** can **get around
any veto** simply by stating it is in the **US national
interest**.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Erdogan Bad -- Climate

#### Erdogan's authoritarian state causes climate change.

in-depth stories about the Caucasus region and Turkey, "Turkey's
authoritarian development ignores planetary boundaries",
https://news.mongabay.com/2022/07/turkeys-authoritarian-development-ignores-planetary-boundaries/
\\\\SYang

[Turkey, an **increasingly autocratic country** since Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan and his AKP political party came to power in 2002, was the
**very last G20 nation** to ratify the **Paris climate
agreement**]{.underline}, doing so in October 2021. [It has
**failed**]{.underline} so far [to take **meaningful
action**]{.underline} against the steady increase of its greenhouse gas
emissions.

[Turkey may also be **exceeding limits** to **many of the nine**
planetary **boundaries critical to the survival** of
**civilization**.]{.underline} In addition to unregulated carbon
emissions, experts are concerned over the nation's worsening air and
plastic pollution, altered land use due to new mega-infrastructure
projects, and biodiversity harm.

For the past two decades, [Turkey's **economic growth** has been based
on **carbon-intensive sectors** --- including **fossil fuel energy**,
**transportation**, **construction**, **mining and heavy
industry**]{.underline} --- all heavily **[supported by the
state]{.underline}** via subsidies, questionable public-private
partnerships, and lax environmental laws.

Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's [**authoritarianism** has
**undermined checks and balances** which might otherwise enhance
**environmental governance**]{.underline}. As activists and academics
criticize the lack of transparency regarding environmental data, they
face rising governmental pressures and repression.
