**[2AC AT: NATO Evil]{.underline}**

**NATO can be used for progressive ends\-\--it empirically prevents
conflict**

Currently, President Trump like the administrations of old has continued
many of these same reckless policies and pointless aggressive wars. 
However, President Trump has taken these reckless policies a dangerous
step further by undermining and trying to destroy agreements and
policies that keep peace and stability in at-risk parts of the world by
constantly attacking our closest allies with false claims and outrageous
rants. One of the few current US foreign policies that is agreeable and
good for both the country and world at large is the United States'
involvement in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, better known as
NATO.  

NATO was created on April 4, 1949, with the signing of the North
Atlantic Treaty. Despite popular belief, [NATO]{.underline} [was created
for more than just]{.underline} [countering]{.underline} the political
and military threat at the time in [the Soviet Union]{.underline}.  The
[treaty]{.underline} [set]{.underline} [up]{.underline} several
[commitments and goals for each member nation to]{.underline} uphold and
[pursue]{.underline} including maintaining [peace in
Europe,]{.underline} [creating cooperation among NATO
members]{.underline}, [and mutual defense]{.underline}.  The
**[treaty]{.underline}** also **[commits]{.underline}**
**[members]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}** ideals of
**[democracy]{.underline}**, **[liberty]{.underline}**, **[and peaceful
resolutions]{.underline}** to international disputes. [NATO]{.underline}
has been able to withstand the test of time because it has constantly
changed and **[evolved]{.underline} [to meet current]{.underline}**
[political]{.underline} [and international security
**concerns**]{.underline} all [while]{.underline}
[maintaining]{.underline} its [core]{.underline} goals and
[beliefs]{.underline}. 

Over the years [NATO]{.underline} has had many achievements.  These
achievements include having seven straight decades of peace within NATO
borders; [forging]{.underline} [over forty partnerships]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} [non-member nations]{.underline} around the world to
ensure stability, peace, and **[conflict reduction]{.underline}**;
enacting [international crisis management operations]{.underline}
[like]{.underline} **[peacekeeping]{.underline}** operations
**[in]{.underline} [Kosovo]{.underline}** [during]{.underline} the [late
1990s]{.underline} \-- resulting in the current peace and start of new
prosperity in the Balkans; [and **working with the African
Union**]{.underline} **[to stop piracy off]{.underline}** the **[coast
of Africa]{.underline}** \-- [resulting]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
**[piracy]{.underline}** being [**down 75%** since 2011]{.underline}.

Despite all NATO's success, [there are still]{.underline} many
**[challenges]{.underline}** [that face the]{.underline} world and the
[alliance]{.underline} [that **one nation cannot handle
alone**]{.underline}.  These [threats include global **terrorism**,
**cyber** attacks]{.underline}, environmental issues like **[climate
change]{.underline}**, [and **Russia's aggression**]{.underline} in
Eastern Europe with the illegal annexation of Crimea and the build-up of
military forces along NATO's borders.  NATO is preparing itself to
address these issues by reinforcing its deterrent efforts, supporting
international efforts to maintain stability, investing in
counter-terrorism, combating climate change and preparing cyber
defenses. Together [through mutual defense, counter-terrorism, and
stability efforts]{.underline}, the [United States through]{.underline}
involvement in [NATO]{.underline} [can work with international
partners]{.underline} [to avoid conflict]{.underline} and build a better
world.

Despite Trump, most of the grown-ups in his defense and foreign policy
setup want to stay involved in NATO. Why? And why should progressives
care?

The first major reason to stay involved in NATO is mutual defense and
security between allied nations. The [biggest component of
NATO's]{.underline} founding [treaty is Article Five]{.underline}, which
establishes that an attack on one member ally is considered to be an
attack on all allies.  This important article is crucial for many
reasons, but principally providing more resources to allies in a
crisis.  NATO has many different types of countries both big and small
from regions across Europe and North America.  [Some]{.underline}
[smaller]{.underline} [nations]{.underline} like the Balkans nation of
Montenegro [are]{.underline} centered **[in regions where there have
been]{.underline} [decades]{.underline} [of]{.underline}** political
**[instability]{.underline}** and armed conflict.  [If]{.underline} an
[armed conflict]{.underline} [arose]{.underline}, **[smaller
nations]{.underline}** like Montenegro would **[have]{.underline}** the
resources and **[support]{.underline}** needed from outside allies [**to
repel** outside **attack**]{.underline} **[and]{.underline}** to help
**[protect]{.underline}** the **[country's people and
sovereignty]{.underline}**. 

Another positive aspect of Mutual Defense is the fact that it builds
close relationships that spill into other aspects of life.  It should be
no shock that many of our same NATO allies are also our closest trading
partners.  Through trade and international commerce, with other NATO
nations, the United States can sell more goods and collectively grow its
economy as well our allies, creating mutual economic benefit.  Finally,
[alliances like **NATO make it easier to share ideas**]{.underline} and
culture between nations.  The sharing of ideas and knowledge
[collectively]{.underline} **[improves]{.underline}** and advances of
**[societies]{.underline}** across the alliance from the United States
to Estonia and everywhere in between. [Mutual defense]{.underline} also
[serves]{.underline} [as]{.underline} a powerful [**deterrent to prevent
armed** conflict]{.underline} or acts of aggression toward allied
nations. 

NATO's 2014 update, the Readiness Action Plan, sharpens the alliance's
ability to move quickly in fast-moving emergencies, including increasing
rapid-response forces and more mobile, small headquarters.

Terrorism is a persistent global challenge that is one of the biggest
threats to citizens of the United States and all NATO countries. 
Terrorism knows no border, nationality or religion, making it a
difficult issue to address and one that no one nation can handle
alone. The US works within the Terrorism Intelligence Cell at NATO
headquarters and in a hub in Naples, Italy to improve threat awareness
and preparedness to respond to attacks -- anywhere in the Alliance,
including the US and Canada.

 The third and final major reason the **[United States should remain
involved in NATO]{.underline}** is [to maintain stability]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [prevent]{.underline} [conflict]{.underline} around
the world. NATO establishes peace by working with international partners
from shaping policy to building defense capacity. Over the past several
years, [NATO]{.underline} has [started]{.underline} [over]{.underline}
[450 collaborative activities]{.underline} among its 29 member nations
[and 41 partner countries]{.underline} [ranging]{.underline} [from cyber
defense to humanitarian efforts]{.underline}.  [NATO]{.underline}
 [efforts]{.underline} were [vital]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
bringing peace to the Balkans in the 1990's, [preventing]{.underline}
[World War III during the Cold War]{.underline}, and helping governments
rebuild stability after failed wars in the Middle East.  Through
building international partnerships and collaborating with member
nations, the [United States can reduce the number of
conflicts]{.underline} that take place [around the world and help bring
stability]{.underline} to at-risk regions of the world [without
involving major US presence or armed conflict]{.underline}.  

 It is the goal of all progressives to create a US foreign policy that
is less militaristic, expensive and aggressive.  That is why as a nation
and as a political movement we must remain committed to NATO
involvement.  One of the most important things when it comes to bringing
peace and stability is this: **[If we don't want US]{.underline}
[troops]{.underline}** fighting **[in foreign lands]{.underline}**,
[we]{.underline} [**need to maintain** our **alliances**]{.underline}.
Our commitment must focus on changing foreign policy to reduce the
amount we spend on defense and end the number of aggressive wars we
enter.  As a member of NATO, our [allies can help us achieve that goal
by helping]{.underline} in our [national security through
collaboration]{.underline} and help maintain stability by working with
international partners to bring and maintain peace. 

That being said, I hope that [we can **transform US foreign
policy**]{.underline} **[from]{.underline}** its current
**[militaristic]{.underline}** and aggressive attitude
**[to]{.underline} [working]{.underline} [with]{.underline}** our
**[allies]{.underline}** to ensure peace through other means and working
to [prevent attacks in our own borders instead of
interfering]{.underline} and causing instability [in other
nations]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} **[progressive goal can be
achieved]{.underline}** [if we stay a part of the]{.underline} [NATO
alliance]{.underline}.

**NATO's key to progressive action\-\--their framework overemphasizes
the US, which leaves us vulnerable to China and Russia's
totalitarianism**

**Riggio 20** (Adam Riggio, writer for the Canada Files, 5-7-2020, "Adam
Riggio: Why we must fight for a socialist NATO", The Canada Files,
Accessed 7-21-2022, <https://www.thecanadafiles.com/articles/so> )//kpt

The Radical Progressive Critique of NATO

Here is the radical socialist critique of NATO: its purpose is to
install and defend American business interests by maintaining capitalism
in Europe, NATO organized secret military associations in its own member
countries to prevent European socialism's democratic political
advancement, and is building a global network of alliances to defeat
geopolitical enemies.

Marxist historians such as Vijay Prashad have argued that [NATO's main
purpose as a military
alliance](https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/09/global-nato-a-70-year-alliance-of-oppressors-in-crisis/)
was to secure lucrative investments by American businesses and
government in the rebuilding of Western Europe's infrastructure. Other
researchers have uncovered more chilling NATO activities throughout
Europe during the Cold War. Daniele Ganser's research on [Operation
Gladio](http://hnn.us/articles/12253.html) argues that NATO organized
guerrilla groups and spies to provoke increased violence among radical
left groups.

These secret NATO-supported groups facilitated crimes, murders, and even
the total overthrow of socialist-minded governments throughout alliance
members. Ganser has credibly accused one of NATO's secret armed groups
of [kidnapping and murdering](https://www.varsity.co.uk/features/13006)
Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro in 1978, to prevent him from inviting
the country's Communist Party into his parliamentary coalition.

Most progressives know how, in the twenty-first century, NATO has
prosecuted the grinding horror show of the ongoing war in Afghanistan,
and given ample material aid to the US invasion and occupation of Iraq.
However, [modern **NATO** **operates** **on a** much **larger field
than** as mere assistance troops to **America's** **fever dream military
imperialism**]{.underline}. The [Atlantic alliance has gone global,
attempting to encircle the geopolitical powers of Russia and
China.]{.underline}

The 29 [current member states of NATO include many former Warsaw Pact
states]{.underline}, an expansion this century that provoked Russia's
military destabilization of former Soviet republics, Ukraine and
Georgia. But NATO [also includes an outer ring of states that are
affiliates in broader military]{.underline} [alliances]{.underline}:
Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and the UAE are all part of a joint protection
agreement; NATO [holds bilateral military alliances with Australia, New
Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Colombia; Afghanistan
and Iraq signed similar military alliances with NATO]{.underline}, when
both countries were heavily occupied by American troops.

We Are the Casualties of Their Games and Greed

[Admitting NATO'S crimes and anti-democratic effects is]{.underline},
however, [only the first step to understand the actual bind in which we
progressives]{.underline} [are stuck]{.underline}. [Too
many]{.underline} among **[progressives]{.underline}** and radical
socialists [are trapped]{.underline} [in this stunted way]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} [thinking]{.underline} [because]{.underline} [of how we
**understand** **neoliberal capitalism as**]{.underline} a **[uniquely
American]{.underline}** project.

Movements for social progress around the world grow precarious in the
shadow of the geopolitical games of our great state powers jockeying for
military and economic influence and domination. The socialist left has
long been well aware of the brutality and rapaciousness of capitalism.

Decades of research and journalism have demonstrated the central role of
American military and economic policy in pressing capitalist development
around the world. The [intellectual tradition of studying]{.underline}
how [capitalism]{.underline} began with Karl Marx himself and continues
through generations across a variety of disciplines. Many well-educated
progressives have studied these traditions, whether in the formal
settings of universities to our own learning. But much of this tradition
[focuses on the American role in promoting global
capitalism.]{.underline}

We [progressives today must face]{.underline} a terrifying truth: [the
**American state is not alone in** **enforcing** the **brutal**
innovations in **capitalism**]{.underline} that have developed over the
last generation.

Monstrosities of Mafia Fascism and Absolutism

Russia was once an ally of socialist liberation movements around the
world, though their own revolution under Josef Stalin had collapsed into
state-controlled capitalism and government by secret police.

Now, Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}** has [restored]{.underline}
[totalitarian principle]{.underline}s of government [to
Russia]{.underline}, as their [domestic policy is]{.underline} the
[economic]{.underline} and political [[devastation of the Russian
people]{.underline}](https://www.dw.com/en/masha-gessen-depicts-russias-slide-to-totalitarianism-under-putin/a-47992798).
In other words, [Putin]{.underline} **[facilitated]{.underline}** the
[**wholesale theft of** hundreds of **billions** of dollars in wealth
from the]{.underline} [Russian state and]{.underline} its [industries to
a clique of former bureaucratic and secret police
apparatchiks]{.underline}, of which is he leader. Those oligarchs are
also leaders and financiers in Russia's international mafia. Putin has
explicitly built his new Russian totalitarianism with significant
influence from the [fascist political philosophy of Ivan
Ilyin](https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/03/16/ivan-ilyin-putins-philosopher-of-russian-fascism/).

Russia is emerging again as a major power in our century's geopolitics,
but the collapse and corruption of much of the American government under
Trump, as well as their homicidal approach to COVID, has made China the
most powerful military and economic state in the world.

For decades, the **[Chinese]{.underline}** **[state]{.underline}** has
**[governed]{.underline}** its people **[with brutal police enforcement
of regime loyalty]{.underline}**, even [deploying concentration camps
and ethnic cleansing to its conquered territories of]{.underline} [[East
Turkestan](https://theconversation.com/the-ominous-metaphors-of-chinas-uighur-concentration-camps-129665)
and Tibet]{.underline}. More recently, [Xi]{.underline} Jinping's
[regime]{.underline} has been especially [devoted to institutionalizing
his absolute rule over China]{.underline}, and the country's highest
political leaders are themselves embedded in corrupt relationships with
their [most powerful billionaire
businessmen](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/world/asia/wang-jianlin-abillionaire-at-the-intersection-of-business-and-power-in-china.html).

[One need only count the **many**]{.underline} [**[murdered journalists
in Russia]{.underline}**](https://cpj.org/data/killed/europe/russia/)
who have investigated the details of Putin's gangster regime to know
that this geopolitical enemy of America is no friend of the progressive.
The [same goes for dissidents and whistleblowers who have defied Xi's
official truth]{.underline}: they rot in prison like [Liu
Xiaobo](https://www.hrw.org/tag/liu-xiaobo) or disappear from humanity
like [Li
Wenliang](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-04-03/coronavirus-china-doctor-tomb-sweeping).

Three Militaries Against Democracy, Not Just One

[Despite the destruction]{.underline} that the [NATO]{.underline}
military alliance [has caused]{.underline} in Europe and Asia, we
**[progressives]{.underline}** [face an uncomfortable
truth]{.underline}: [we **need** **a military powerful enough to stand
against** the many threats that **Russia and China** pose to democracy
around the world]{.underline}. As well, we [must never let our
opposition to]{.underline} the threat that [America]{.underline} poses
to global democracy [make us patsies for Russian or Chinese
control]{.underline}.

The most potent threat to our own democracies is the destabilization of
our democratic societies. A [foundation of modern **Russia's foreign
policy** is to **aflame** **social conflicts inside** of **democratic**
**polities**, and use weapons of cyber-warfare, **such as viruses and
disinformation**.]{.underline}

China has taken a more traditional route to global dominance.
**[Chinese]{.underline} [investments]{.underline}** [**in** massive
**resource extraction projects across Africa follow** the **model of**
the **old**]{.underline} [[**British East India
Company**](https://africasacountry.com/2020/04/locating-african-agency-in-africa-china-relations).
Take almost all profit from mines and oil wells, while trapping their
African partner states in unsustainable debt from project
financing.]{.underline}

How do we progressive and other ordinary people escape this triple
squeeze between three militarized, aggressive superpower states run by
mafiosi and billionaire power brokers? Anti-capitalist, socialist, and
democratic organization and agitation across the world is really our
only answer.

[We need NATO]{.underline}, but only [because]{.underline} socialist and
[democratic movements are closer to taking some measure of control away
from]{.underline} [the corrupt]{.underline} in Europe and the Americas,
pessimistic though even these prospects often feel. A socialist Europe
and North America would stand against Russia and China as the weapons of
war move to the internet and public political movements themselves.

If the NATO states of Europe and North America could unite in an
aggressive cyberwar to encourage popular resistance to the brutal mafia
totalitarianism of Russia and China, then we will have a chance for
global democracy, socialism, a green economy, and a sustainable
civilization on Earth.

Until those revolutions happen, we remain in our triple bind. But
[**collapsing** our **military entirely**, **while geopolitical enemies
expand and consolidate theirs**, **is** **a recipe for** our
**enslavement**. We remain slaves under neoliberal capitalism, our
opportunities ground to dust.]{.underline}

But states with the power of Europe's and North America's, run on
genuinely egalitarian socialist principles and policies, allied to fight
for actual freedom and dignity of all people, will be a greater threat
to the menace of totalitarianism than the cash-sick militarism of the
old United States ever could have been.

**[2AC -- Security -- FW]{.underline}**

**Our framework is necessary to open up [new pathways]{.underline} to
solve [complex security threats]{.underline} through [citizen
engagement]{.underline}**

**Bisogno 17** (Raymond Bisogno, June 2017, "Problem Solving in Homeland
Security and Creating Policy Conditions For Enhanced Civic Engagement:
An Examination of Crowdsourcing Models," The Journal of the NPS Center
for Homeland Defense and Security,
<https://www.hsaj.org/articles/14064>) nihara

This thesis begins with the premise that [the world has become a more
**dangerous** and **complicated** place due to the spread of
**terrorism**, increasingly damaging **weather events**, and other
threats to **national** and **economic security**]{.underline}. These
[threats]{.underline} (in their broadest sense) [have become **more
diffuse**, and the challenges the government faces to **combat them**
more **complicated**]{.underline}. It may not be, at the end of the day,
reasonable to expect government to address the entire threat landscape
with existing resources alone and leave the public at large essentially
unaffected, or perhaps more importantly, uninvolved. The [conditions for
tapping into citizens' **intellectual capacity** for
**problem-solving**]{.underline}, however, [may not be
**present**]{.underline}. This thesis explored the potential of
crowdsourcing for this purpose, examining cases in various disciplines
to discover what worked well and what did not. A principal focus of the
research was crowdsourcing experiments and engagement models, as well as
a strategy for leveraging technology in these pursuits.

This [research]{.underline} did not attempt to identify problem areas
(what is broken), dysfunctional programs, or reasons for low engagement.
It [analyzed the potential benefits of employing **crowdsourcing**
models in **homeland security** and its related disciplines, using
**appreciative inquiry** to evaluate how existing successful models may
open **new pathways** between government and citizens. These pathways
can lead to the **generation** of **knowledge**, the **exchange** of
**information**, and **innovation** in approaches to
**problemsolving**]{.underline}. In essence, this research focused on
what is working well and looked for ways to apply those methods to
homeland security organizations.

An [examination of crowdsourcing models]{.underline} across a range of
disciplines [indicated that given the right conditions, citizens are
willing and able to **effect positive change** and **solve
problems**]{.underline}. Moreover, [citizens are **highly effective** at
**contributing to projects** in which they are engaged]{.underline},
such as environmental monitoring, the arts, hackathons, and space
exploration. [A number of potential **homeland security applications**
emerged as well. These included developing core values for **public
participation** to ensure equity and integrity, rapid **production of
new ideas** for a time-sensitive problems, and broad **information
collection** and **reporting** in a crisis]{.underline}. In nearly every
case, non-professionals needed only the right conditions to be present
for them to engage.

What this thesis discovered in the process was [**connective
tissue**---ideas for connecting the concepts found across the models
examined---to endeavors in homeland security]{.underline}. A key idea
discussed in an NPS lecture that also emerged as an observable theme
across the research was the notion of viewing government in general as a
platform for innovation rather than a mechanism for the provision of
services.1 [By understanding a citizen's **motivations to engage**,
government can begin to design more **optimal opportunities** for that
engagement]{.underline}. By also considering business and
customer-service sector models, [government can discover new ways to
**increase knowledge** and **value creation**]{.underline}.

[In considering implementation of **crowdsourcing** and **engagement
models**]{.underline}, organizations should consider [ethical, legal,
and social issues]{.underline} as they [develop programs involving
**citizen contributors**]{.underline}. This thesis advanced several
specific recommendations intended to begin forming a framework for
crowdsourcing in homeland security. First, convene a multidisciplinary
commission under the auspices of FEMA and DHS to further explore and
advance the issue. Second, have FEMA and/or DHS select several agencies
to host pilot programs for crowdsourcing projects. Third and finally,
[dedicate **inquiry and research** to incorporating **social science
curriculum** into **homeland security education**]{.underline} (or
viewing homeland security as a social science) [to better understand the
human aspects of homeland security endeavors.]{.underline}

This research may help contribute to the discourse and literature by
providing a [**theoretical policy framework** that embraces
**non-traditional approaches** to meeting **homeland security
objectives**. It may help **open new pathways** to **civic engagement**
or create the conditions in which that engagement can
thrive]{.underline}.

**Specifically true for [geopolitical threats]{.underline}** --
inductive reasoning, cognitive flexibility, AND probabilistic analysis
of geopolitical events **-- increases the [accuracy of
predictions]{.underline} -- which [solves their offense]{.underline} by
checking [the excesses]{.underline} of the [security
complex]{.underline}**

B. [CROWDSOURCING]{.underline} FOR [FORECASTING **GEOPOLITICAL
EVENTS**]{.underline}

The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is the
counterpart to the Pentagon's DARPA. According to IARPA's website, it
invests in "high-risk, highpayoff research programs to tackle some of
the most difficult challenges of the agencies and disciplines in the
Intelligence Community."47 IARPA sponsored a competition called the Good
Judgement Project (GJP) to explore intelligence matters and the ability
of people who are not professional intelligence analysts to forecast
global political events. IARPA initially recruited graduate students,
faculty, and practitioners from the political science realm.48 While a
study from the University of Pennsylvania by Lyle Ungar et al. noted
that [**strong forecasters** exhibited higher levels of **political
knowledge** and **general intelligence**, average citizens with modest
training in probability and statistics and no access to classified
material were able to **predict geopolitical events** with a success
margin as much as **thirty percent higher** than career intelligence
analysts who did have access to classified material.]{.underline}49 This
uneven performance was not due to extraordinary abilities on the part of
citizen-participants, nor was it a reflection of the career analysts'
skills; [it was an outcome of the laws of probability and
statistics]{.underline}. In an April 2014 report on the GJP, National
Public Radio (NPR) explains that [balancing a **wide range of
predictions** can lead to a more **reliable finding** "at the
center."]{.underline}50 Philip Tetlock et al., writing about the GJP for
the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, assessed forecasts over
a two-year period. After more than 150,000 forecasts, 743 participants,
199 events, and two years, they described favorable performance
predictors as follows:

The [best forecasters ... were better at **inductive reasoning**,
**pattern detection**, **cognitive flexibility**, and
**open-mindedness**. They had greater understanding of **geopolitics**,
training in **probabilistic reasoning**, and opportunities to succeed in
cognitively enriched team environments]{.underline}. Last but not least,
[they viewed forecasting as a skill that required **deliberate
practice**, **sustained effort**, and **constant monitoring** of current
affairs]{.underline}.51

In further examining participants' profiles, Tetlock et al. explain that
the [best forecasters "benefitted from working environments with
**probability training** and collaborative teams. And while making
predictions, they spent more time deliberating and **updating their
forecasts**.]{.underline}"52 Moreover, the [predictors of effective
forecasting persisted **across multiple data sets**]{.underline}.53 Some
of the participants, based on their forecasting performance, came to be
known as super-forecasters.54 One such "super" was a gentleman named
Nick Hare. He noted that his success as a forecaster did not have as
much to do with his own body of knowledge as it did with his
[**open-minded approach** as well as his ability to apply the
**scientific method** in evaluating the data rather than accept a
**predefined narrative**]{.underline}.55

As noted by Ungar et al., working in groups greatly improves prediction
accuracy.56 The question of how to utilize the wisdom of the crowds,
this study recognizes, is more difficult to answer than whether or not
that wisdom is valuable: "Although [the 'wisdom of the crowds' and the
power of predictive markets are widely recognized]{.underline}, it is
less clear how to best make use of that wisdom."57 An important dynamic
the study observes is the [risk of group-think when experts are able to
discuss their predictions]{.underline}. While the study acknowledges the
inverse is also possible---that better arguments can be formed this
way---this thesis theorizes [there may be a risk of **groupthink** in
homeland security and **government enterprises** unless outside
perspectives are considered due to **cultural biases** and
**organizational tendencies**. Replicating the GJP in the HSE may
represent a viable pathway for the **contribution of ideas** to help
solve the **nation's complicated problems**]{.underline}.

CHAPTER ONE

Introduction

[How]{.underline} do [**major conflicts start** and how]{.underline} can
[we **tell** when a **crisis** might **escalate** to]{.underline} a
military **[confrontation]{.underline}**? These questions [have long
confronted U.S. policymakers, but they take on new **urgency** as
**great power competition** intensifies with **China** and **Russia**
and **flash points** fester across the **Middle East** and
elsewhere]{.underline}.1 [Understanding the dynamics of **crisis
escalation** and **conflict occurrence** are necessary to help
**intelligence analysts** and **policymakers** understand
whether]{.underline} particular [crises are **more** or **less likely**
to **escalate** and how **U.S. actions**, such as]{.underline} the
[deployment]{.underline} of additional forces to a crisis, [might
**ameliorate** or **exacerbate** those dynamics]{.underline}. In
addition, [understanding the **underlying causes** of crisis
**escalation** and military conflict, and how those dynamics are
affected by emergent **geopolitical trends**, can help defense planners
to more **effectively anticipate** and **prepare** for potential
**contingencies**.]{.underline}

[The **challenge** of **anticipating** a military **contingency**
is]{.underline} further [compounded by]{.underline} the [**increasing**
reliance on **ambiguous** forms of interstate conflict favored
by]{.underline} states like [**China** and **Russia** that **blur the
line** between military and nonmilitary actions]{.underline}. These
tactics, labeled ["**gray zone**" or "**hybrid warfare**,"]{.underline}
often [feature state-backed forces who engage in coercive or violent
actions]{.underline} but [below a threshold that **typically triggers**
U.S. military **combat operations** on behalf of an ally.]{.underline}2
[These tactics allow adversaries to incrementally **advance state aims**
while **minimizing** the **risks** of conflict. They also offer the
advantage of **rapid fielding** relevant **capabilities** with **minimal
warning** to **U.S. forces**, requiring the United States to **act
quickly** in **ambiguous** circumstances.]{.underline} Moreover, [these
tactics]{.underline}, while effective, [invariably carry a risk of
sparking **militarized crisis** and]{.underline} subsequently, the
potential for **[escalation]{.underline}** to conventional military
conflict.

In some cases, hybrid warfare operations could be deliberately planned
as when "snap exercises" by Russia disguise movements of military
forces.3 [If the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is **ill
prepared** to respond in such cases, there is a possibility that U.S.
and Allied forces could be surprised and suffer losses]{.underline}.4
Similarly, the development of artificial islands in the South China Sea
effectively masked, until recently, China's military intentions to gain
greater control of the maritime region through a fait accompli.5 [These
actions **threaten U.S. allies** and raise the risk that a **crisis**
could **escalate** into a **military engagement** that could **draw in**
U.S. **forces**. The challenge of responding to these threats is
compounded by **constrained** defense **resources** that have led to
**reductions** in **deployed forces** abroad. These realities have
**increased** the **imperative** to accurately **anticipate** and
**effectively respond** to the **threat of conflict** in a timely
manner]{.underline}.

In this report, we aim to achieve four things. First, we distinguish
between politicalstrategic and military decisions in the work of defense
planning. We argue that many of the [questions regarding the onset of
**conflict**, **management** of **crises**, and escalation or
**de-escalation** of conflict are]{.underline} primarily
[**political-strategic** in nature and]{.underline} thus [have
**analytic requirements**]{.underline} distinctly [different
from]{.underline} those for [military decisions]{.underline}. Second, we
explain why the current practice of employing scenarios to support
political-strategic decisions is problematic. [Current doctrine
articulates a **rigorous methodology** to support **military
decisions**, but **guidance** on how to develop **assumptions** and
address nonmilitary factors remains]{.underline} largely
[**undeveloped** or **absent**]{.underline}. Accordingly, [existing
methods favor the development of scenarios that feature problems of
**opaque method**ology, **unfounded assumptions**, and
**implausibility** when applied to politicalstrategic concerns.
These]{.underline} defects not only [**impair efforts** to develop more
**rigorous analysis** to support political-strategic decisions,
but]{.underline} they can [also **impede analysis** to support
**military decisions**]{.underline}. Third, we argue that [recent
findings in **social science** regarding **variables** related to
**crises** and **conflicts** offer]{.underline} the [potential
to]{.underline} remedy these defects and [aid]{.underline} the
[development of more **rigorous**, **transparent**, and **realistic
scenarios**]{.underline}. We survey some of these key, albeit tentative,
[findings regarding both the **structural**, or underlying, factors, and
the **proximate**, or immediate, factors responsible for militarized
crisis and conflict]{.underline}. Finally, we [show how **scenario
designers** can **incorporate** these factors into more **holistic**,
**rigorous**, and **politically realistic** assumptions, a process that
we call "**science-based structured scenarios**."]{.underline} We also
show how these [sciencebased structured scenarios can be **tailored** to
**flexibly suit** the **specific needs** of defense
planners]{.underline}. To illustrate how this methodology might be
applied, we provide an example centered on a hypothetical China-Taiwan
conflict.

Abstract This article provides the first excavation of the foundational
role of racist thought in securitization theory. We demonstrate that
Copenhagen School [**securitization theory** is structured not only by
**Eurocentrism** but also by **civilizationism**, **methodological
whiteness**, and **antiblack racism**]{.underline}. Classic
securitization theory [advances a conceptualization of 'normal politics'
as reasoned, civilized dialogue, and securitization as a **potential
regression** into a **racially coded** uncivilized '**state of
nature'**. It justifies this through a **civilizationist history** of
the world that **privileges Europe** as the **apex** of **civilized
'desecuritization'**, sanitizing its violent **(settler-) colonial
projects** and the **racial violence** of normal liberal
politics]{.underline}. It then [constructs a methodologically and
normatively **white framework**]{.underline} that uses speech act theory
to locate 'progress' towards normal politics and desecuritization in
Europe, making becoming like Europe a moral imperative. Using ostensibly
neutral terms, securitization theory prioritizes order over justice,
[positioning the securitization theorist as the defender of (**white)
'civilized politics'** against **(racialized) 'primal anarchy'**.
**Antiblackness** is a **crucial** building-block in this]{.underline}
conceptual edifice: [securitization theory finds '**primal anarchy**'
especially in 'Africa', casting it as an **irrationally
oversecuritized** foil to '**civilized politics'**]{.underline}. We
conclude by discussing whether the theory, or even just the concept of
securitization, can be recuperated from these racist foundations.
Introduction Securitization theory has unquestionably made a significant
impact. Its founding texts are among the most widely cited international
relations scholarship (see Buzan and Wæver, 2003; Buzan et al., 1998;
Wæver, 1995; Wæver et al., 1993), spawning active research programs and
new 'generations' of securitization theory. The concept of
securitization has travelled to disciplines beyond international
relations, and even entered public discourse. What is so appealing about
this theory? Perhaps the most tempting aspect of securitization theory
is its methodological rigor. It provides a clear set of steps and
standards for identifying how referent objects (e.g. migration, health,
cyberspace) become security problems and deciding whether they should
indeed be 'securitized'. This readymade methodology can be applied to
all sorts of empirical areas. However, students and scholars of security
ought to resist this temptation of a readymade approach and inquire more
deeply into securitization theory's core theoretical assumptions and
methodology. This article argues that [**racist thought** is
**fundamental** and **integral** to classic securitization theory's
conceptual and methodological project]{.underline}. While other
scholarship has worked either to incorporate analysis of race into
securitization theory (Amin-Khan, 2012; Ibrahim, 2005; Mofette and
Vadasaria, 2016) or to overcome securitization theory's Eurocentrism
(Bilgin, 2010, 2011; Wilkinson, 2007), this article offers something
different. It is the first to excavate the foundations of securitization
theory in racist thought. We demonstrate that [classic securitization
theory is fundamentally and inextricably structured not only by
**Eurocentrism** but also by **civilizationism**, **methodological
whiteness**, and **antiblack racism**]{.underline}. What does it mean to
excavate the racist foundations of a theory? That we use the 'r-word'
and white supremacy as categories of analysis is sure to raise eyebrows.
Even sympathetic readers might wonder if the problem we identify is more
appropriately characterized as Eurocentrism. Critique of the Eurocentric
character of much Western scholarship and cultural production has made
significant inroads across academic disciplines, including international
relations (Hobson, 2012; Sabaratnam, 2013). Our analysis is inspired by
this research and extends some of its insights. Yet there is more to be
said. [**Black studies** and **decolonial scholarship** demonstrate that
much orthodox and critical Western social and political thought is
predicated upon **epistemological** and **ontological** premises that
are not simply Eurocentric but **racist**, specifically **white
supremacist**]{.underline}. In international relations, recent debates
have addressed the question of whether postcolonial international
relations should proceed solely through an analytic of Eurocentrism or
whether we need to more specifically address racism and white
supremacism (Gruffydd Jones, 2016; Hozić, 2016; Rutazibwa, 2016; Sajed,
2016). Sajed (2016: 168) suggests that the term 'Eurocentric'
potentially neutralizes the foundational and continuing racism of the
discipline. Rutazibwa (2016: 192) asks, '[what existing power structure
does this reluctance \[to name racism\] serve]{.underline}?' Echoing
these concerns, we ask: What is at stake in the reluctance to name
racism in analyses of international security? Racism is a fundamental
system of power that has profoundly shaped the world for the past
several hundred years. Moreover, as is now well established,
international relations emerged to provide intellectual support for the
imperial and (settler-)colonial ambitions of Western states
(Agathangelou and Ling, 2004a; Krishna, 2001; Vitalis, 2000, 2015).
Drawing on black studies, indigenous studies, and decolonial
scholarship, we illustrate the racist modes of thought that underpin
classic securitization theory by deploying three concepts beyond
Eurocentrism: civilizationism, methodological whiteness, and antiblack
racism. [The argument presented here is not a **personal indictment** of
any **particular author**]{.underline}. Contrary to commonsense notions
that reduce racism to interpersonal prejudices of openly bigoted
individuals, racism and white supremacy are systems of power
(Bonilla-Silva, 2006). [Epistemic racism is **intrinsic** to **Western
knowledge structures**]{.underline}, and not merely a failure of
individual scholarship (Bhambra, 2013; Grosfoguel, 2003). Just as the
ongoing racialized distribution of life chances across liberal societies
is not simply the effect of intentionally racist individuals,
[racialized knowledge production is not simply the result of bad or
flawed **individual theorists**]{.underline}. Colonial and racist
assumptions about racial and civilizational difference animate the core
political categories and theoretical frameworks of Western social and
political thought. As we demonstrate, [this is also true of classic
**securitization theory**]{.underline}. We begin by acknowledging that
discussions of racism or colonialism are not entirely absent in classic
securitization theory. Security: A New Framework for Analysis briefly
discusses the racial politics of US domestic societal security (Buzan et
al., 1998: 130). In one of securitization theory's original
formulations, Wæver discusses neo-Nazi attacks on asylum-seekers and
racist justifications for the securitization of migration (Wæver, 1995;
70; see also Buzan et al., 1998; 42, 44--45). Colonialism is sometimes
referenced (see Buzan et al., 1998: 61, 63, 98, 129; Buzan and Wæver,
2003: 14--18, 221), and white supremacism is mentioned as a potential
'macrosecuritization' (Buzan and Wæver, 2009: 263). Our [argument is not
that race is absent in securitization theory, but that **racist
political thought** is **integral** to it, even when classic
securitization theory texts **discuss race** or
**colonialism**.]{.underline} The article proceeds in four sections. The
first section reviews the securitization theory framework and notable
criticisms of it. The second focuses on the conceptual apparatus of
securitization theory, showing how its conceptualization of 'politics'
and 'security' is founded in civilizationist thought. The third section
focuses on securitization theory's methodology, highlighting its
methodological whiteness. The fourth section illustrates how
antiblackness is a crucial building-block in securitization theory's
conceptual division between security and politics. Securitization theory
finds 'primal anarchy' especially in 'Africa', which it casts as
irrationally oversecuritized, making it a foil to 'civilized politics'.
Throughout, we focus on classic articulations of securitization theory
associated with the Copenhagen School. Classic securitization theory is
very much an ongoing intellectual project that continues to be
assertively defended by its founders (Buzan and Wæver, 1997; Wæver,
2011, 2015), and its basic precepts are in need of questioning in new
ways. However, we are not unaware of divergences in 'second-generation'
and other iterations of securitization theory. We therefore conclude
with some thoughts about whether other versions of securitization theory
emulate or dispense with the racism of classic securitization theory,
and a discussion of whether the theory, or even just the word
'securitization', can be salvaged.

**[2AC -- Russia revisionist]{.underline}**

and [expansionism]{.underline} through [aggressive]{.underline} military

Most [scholars of i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations
today [believe]{.underline} that [the **international order** is in
**crisis**]{.underline}. Haas (Haas, 2015) suggests a gradual
[transformation of the international system into]{.underline} a
[post-hegemonic global governance,]{.underline} Acharya (Acharya, 2014)
the [formation of a less centralized system based on regional level
interactions, and]{.underline} Kahler (Kahler, 2013) [the emergence of
new rising powers]{.underline} as moderate reformers
[influencing]{.underline} the [change of international rules through the
existing forums]{.underline}.

[In]{.underline} the sphere of [challenges to the **liberal world
order**, Allison]{.underline} (Allison, 2014) [sees]{.underline}
Vladimir [**Putin\'s annexation** of the **Crimea** as the most visible
threat to the **stability** and **preservation** of the present
international order.]{.underline} In his view, [Russia\'s **blatant
violation** of **international norms**, backed up by **military force**
in the **absence** of any **conditions** legitimizing its use, is
**indicative** of an **aggressive strategy** designed to **oppose
western rules** politically, culturally, and militarily]{.underline}
(Allison, 2017). As effectively pointed out by Krastev (Krastev, 2014:
3), [Putin\'s vision of the new world is one of **constant escalation**
aimed at **altering** the **status quo**]{.underline}: 'He has [refused
to play by Western rules]{.underline}. He [seems not to fear political
isolation; he invites it.]{.underline} He [seems not worry about the
closing of borders; he hopes for it]{.underline}. His [foreign policy
amounts to deep **rejection** of modern **Western values** and an
attempt to draw a **clear line** between **Russia\'s
world**]{.underline} and Europe\'s. For Putin, Crimea is likely just the
beginning'.

What is the nature of the threats that Russia poses to the present
international order? Can Russia be described as an authentic revisionist
power? Is the military intervention in Crimea really just the beginning?
How are we to interpret Moscow\'s decision to intervene in Syria?

If we assume that [the **rise of Putin**, strengthened by his fourth
presidential mandate, constitutes a factor **essential** to any
understanding of Russian **foreign politics**]{.underline} over the last
decade and its inclusion, at least at first sight, among these so-called
ones rising powers, it follows that an in-depth analysis of the nature
of the challenges that Moscow is making to the world liberal order will
entail first of all a reconstruction of the political and strategic
context in which these challenges have begun to take shape.
[Russia\'s]{.underline} current [**refusal to accept** the rules of the
**post-bipolar** system passively and]{.underline} therefore to [comply
with a **redistribution** of power that **denies** the country its
previous]{.underline}ly acquired **[centrality]{.underline}** is the
result of a series of closely connected events that have developed since
the end of the Cold War (Pisciotta, Reference Pisciotta, Clementi, Dian
and Pisciotta2018).

On the basis of the above premises, this paper seeks to develop a [new
typology of **revisionism**]{.underline} based on the nature of the aims
(territorial/normative/hierarchy of prestige), the means employed
(peaceful/violent), and the level of action (regional/global). This will
then be used to [**explain** the **escalation** of Russia\'s foreign
policy from **regional** to **global claims** with reference to its
**military interventions** in **Georgia**, **Ukraine**, and **Syria**
and]{.underline} to [identify the type of **revisionism involved in
each** of the three Russian military interventions undertaken both
**inside** (Georgia and Ukraine) and **outside** (Syria) the
**post-soviet space**]{.underline}.

To this end, the paper is divided into three parts. The first examines
the concept of revisionism and suggests a classification of six kinds in
relation to the means, nature, and level of the claims put forward by
revisionist powers. The second discusses the [**interventions** carried
out by Russia within its regional area]{.underline} ([in Georgia and
Ukraine]{.underline}) and [highlights]{.underline} their
[**similarities** in light of]{.underline} the predominant model of
**[revisionism]{.underline}**. The third analyses the [military
intervention in Syria]{.underline} and [notes]{.underline} both the
[**escalation** in the projection of **Russian claims** from the
**regional** level to the **global** and]{.underline} the type of
**[revisionism]{.underline}** involved.

**Our methodological approach to determine Russian revisionism is an
[effective heuristic]{.underline}, delimiting it's
[application]{.underline} which [solves the links]{.underline} -- BUT,
[confining it]{.underline} to a set of [realistic threats]{.underline}
-- AND, analyzing [individual actions]{.underline} to [accurately
depict]{.underline} and [compare]{.underline} foreign policy**

A new typology of revisionism

In addition to the nature of the revisionist objectives (territory,
international norms, or prestige) and the means employed (violent or
peaceful), [there is another crucial aspect]{.underline} that the
literature has not taken into account: [the **level of action**, which
can be **regional** or **global**]{.underline}. As we\'ll see, this
aspect is crucial [for the development of a new **typology of
revisionism**.]{.underline}

[At the **regional level**]{.underline}, the [intent to control or
**annex a territory**, reformulate the norms, modify the regional
structure, or alter the hierarchy of prestige is confined]{.underline}
exclusively [to the regional area in which the revisionist power is
located.]{.underline} More specifically, [the regional area delimits the
actions that a state can decide to undertake with respect to the
countries dependent on it and/or geographically, economically, and
culturally involved in relations with it. The **degree of danger** of
the threat of possible changes to the status quo is a **reflection** of
**regional balances of power** and directly affects the **neighbouring
states** and those located in the area.]{.underline} The Chinese policy
of investments in South-East Asia and Russia\'s economic, energy, and
military policy towards the former Soviet republics provide two
excellent examples of action confined to the regional level.

[When]{.underline} the [demands of the revisionist power extend beyond
its regional area, the challenge can instead involve the **dominant
global power** (or powers) directly with the risk of **limiting** or
**compromising** its (their) **strategic interests** and **spheres of
influence** at the **global level**]{.underline}. In this case, unlike
the previous one, [the action undertaken]{.underline} by the revisionist
state, be it peaceful or violent, [tends to go beyond the boundaries of
its regional area and extend to the **international
order**]{.underline}, thus [affecting the **international norms**, the
**hierarchy of prestige**, the **distribution of power** and the
**control** or conquest of territories, neighbouring, and
otherwise.]{.underline} It is known that the regional and the global
levels are both 'external' with respect to national boundaries
(Pisciotta, 2016). In order to avoid misunderstandings, here we prefer
to use the term 'global' rather than 'international' to stress the
difference between a geographically delimited space (regional) and a
potentially open space (global), by definition exposed to any external
factor (regional, international, transnational).

The three dimensions of revisionism, namely the level of the aims
(regional or global), their nature (territory/norms/power/prestige), and
the means employed (violent or peaceful), can thus be used to develop
six different kinds of revisionism as shown in Table 1.

**\[TABLE 1 OMITTED\]**

This typology contains two new elements with respect to those formulated
in the past. The first regards the introduction of [the level of action
(regional/global)]{.underline} undertaken by the revisionist state. As
we shall see below, this [dimension is of crucial importance to
highlight the **gradual escalation** of aims and the means employed,
especially when there is recourse to **military force**, in transition
from the regional to the global level. The **degree of danger** of the
threat to the status quo is **directly proportional** to the **level**
at which action is undertaken]{.underline}. In the present international
system, where various actors would find it in their interest to
counterbalance US hegemony but lack the means to do so, it is of crucial
importance to note [the presence of an actor that has **no hesitation**
in resorting to **military force** in the pursuit of its own interest
outside its **regional area** and without the consent of the **hegemonic
power**]{.underline}.

The second regards the relation between [**means** employed, **level of
action**, and **objectives**]{.underline}. If all three dimensions [work
simultaneously to determine the type of revisionism, it is possible to
compare the different **empirical cases** and **highlight similarities**
and **differences** between]{.underline} the [different]{.underline}
forms of [foreign policy]{.underline}, which would collapse if there
were no connections between their objectives, means, and level of
action. For example, two countries can both pursue the aim of changing
the hierarchy of international prestige, and therefore act at the global
level, but may choose to use force or diplomacy. It is true that the
degree of threat to the status quo can be equally high, especially when
the action undertaken proves more underhand and less visible, but [the
use of military force, being more **explicit** and **devastating**, can
require equally explicit and devastating means in order to restore the
status quo.]{.underline} Moreover, [the use of military force
**outside** a country\'s **regional area** can be associated both with
objectives of **territorial conquest**]{.underline}, the [**pursuit of
hegemony** and a complete **change in the status quo**]{.underline}, and
[with objectives of mere **control** over zones of **strategic
importance** together with the security of **national borders** and
increase in **power** and prestige. There is]{.underline} evidently [a
substantial difference between these]{.underline} two [kinds of
revisionism and hence a drastic difference in the level of the threat to
the status quo.]{.underline} Equally different are two forms of foreign
policy that both opt for the use of peaceful means but pursue markedly
different objectives at the global level, such as changing international
norms or regimes on the one hand or the hierarchy of power on the other.
While both can produce substantial change at the global level, it is
clearly only the second type of revisionism that can potentially affect
the distribution of power.

In this framework, [**nationalist** revisionism, **radical**
revisionism, and **revolutionary** revisionism represent]{.underline}
three forms of [change in terms]{.underline} both [of **expansion** and
of **control over territory** on the part of the revisionist
power]{.underline}. [All three presuppose the use of **military force**
and objectives of **power** and **territory** with a **gradual
escalation** in the degree of change pursued]{.underline}. The first
(**[nationalist]{.underline}**) [involves]{.underline} forms of
[territorial expansionism or annexation]{.underline} with respect [to
neighbouring countries for the improvement of power]{.underline} and
prestige at the regional level. The second ([radical]{.underline}) [is
an intermediate modality of change in prestige and/or power at the
global level]{.underline}, with or without any intention to alter the
international norms, [through]{.underline} the [acquisition
of]{.underline} the part of the revisionist state of [territorial
control over areas that are geographically distant but]{.underline}
regarded as [strategically vital]{.underline} to its national interests.
The third and most extreme (**[revolutionary]{.underline}**) [is based
on military conquest and the overall redistribution of power, rules and
territory at the global level.]{.underline} The [(**nationalist**)
**Russian** military **interventions** in **Georgia** and **Ukraine**,
the (**radical**) Russian military intervention in
**Syria**]{.underline}, and the (revolutionary) foreign policy of Nazi
Germany [are]{.underline} three [examples of each]{.underline} of the
type put forward. It should be pointed out that in the typology
presented here, only revolutionary revisionism -- which should hopefully
constitute no more than a text-book hypothesis in the current situation
-- corresponds to the kind identified by Buzan, while our radical
revisionism is very different in meaning from his. Anyway, here we
prefer to use the same term because it is the most appropriate to
express our type of revisionism.

Moderate revisionism, normative revisionism, and reformist revisionism
indicate three kinds of foreign policy pursued with non-military means
of diplomatic and/or economic nature and again involve a gradual
escalation of objectives and radius of action. A state may decide to
strengthen its position at the regional level through a whole gamut of
policies ranging from diplomatic or commercial relations with bordering
and/or culturally similar states to the imposition of agreements highly
advantageous to its national interests (moderate revisionism). It may
decide to undertake large-scale diplomatic action at the global level to
modify certain norms and rules of the international system in order to
reduce the economic, social, and political costs they involve for the
country (normative revisionism). It may use diplomatic and financial
means to improve its power and/or prestige at the global level and even
pursue a change in international norms (reformist revisionism). The
policy of investments adopted by China in the less developed countries
of South-East Asia (moderate), the aspirations of the Group of 77 for
the NIEO (normative), and the Chinese policy of
peaceful/rise/development at the global level (reformist) are examples
of the three kinds of revisionism listed above.

Since every kind of revisionism always seeks a change in the status quo,
differing in intensity but in any case always substantial, it follows
that even when economic means are employed to attain the set objectives,
the effects produced are anything but mild. On the basis of this
assumption, [the typology put forward here can provide an **effective
heuristic tool** for two reasons]{.underline}. First of all, [the close
relationship between means and objectives makes it possible to
**delimit** the **sphere of application** of the concept of revisionism
and **confine** it in most cases solely to states possessing
**sufficient military** and economic resources to be able to **aspire
realistically** to a change in the regional status quo and hope to
strengthen their position with respect to the hegemonic power at the
global level.]{.underline} The weaker states will therefore hardly be
able to pursue any form of revisionism other than the normative with any
reasonable probability of success.

Secondly, the [**distinction** between the **regional** and **global
levels** makes it possible]{.underline} not only [to reconstruct an
**escalation of objectives**]{.underline} as regards change in the
status quo [but]{.underline} it is [also]{.underline} possible to
[**identify** a **predominant** level of revisionism that characterizes
an **entire phase** of foreign policy and is the result of]{.underline}
a series of more or less [**interconnected** individual actions when the
fundamental objective of the state tends to remain comparatively stable
over time]{.underline}. If this does not happen, [it may prove more
useful to determine the **different facets** that emerge from the
**discontinuity** of a **specific phase** of foreign policy through
analysis of the **individual decisions** taken]{.underline}.

Undue importance should not be attached to any discrepancy between
reformist and radical actions, as [the use of **military force**, once
adopted at the global level, drives the **desire for change** in a
direction from which it is not always possible to turn back and that
tends to **characterize** a foreign policy far **more strongly** than
simple **reformism**]{.underline}. In this case, the [connection between
means and objectives emerges from the notion of
'uncertainty']{.underline} introduced by Schweller [with reference to
the decision of a revisionist state to resort to force.]{.underline}
According to the author, this [**uncertainty** arises from the effective
**military capacity** of the revisionist state with respect
to]{.underline} that of [its]{.underline} potential [allies and the
adversary, the **importance** of what is at stake for both sides in the
conflict, and the possible **involvement** of **other
actors**]{.underline}. Schweller argues that [this is a **crucial
criterion** for the identification of actors as **risk-acceptant** and
**risk-averse**: 'Risk-acceptant actors are gamblers, while risk-averse
actors are cautious under conditions of uncertainty. Risk-acceptant
leaders]{.underline}, because they [attach]{.underline} some [**added
utility** to the act of taking a gamble, are **less constrained** in
**making war** decisions than are risk-averse actors; they are the
actors most likely to **saber-rattle**, to **ruthlessly engage** in
greedy **expansion**, and to anticipate bandwagon effects']{.underline}
(Schweller, 2015: 10). [If risk acceptance thus constitutes a key
**determining factor** within the sphere of revisionism, it
follows]{.underline} -- as Schweller argues -- [that risk-acceptant and
revolutionary powers are the most **virulent expanders**.]{.underline}

Although theoretically the military option however represents a risk, in
the analysis of Russian foreign policy the reference to this concept
simplifies the understanding of the nature of the revisionist aims,
especially in terms of nationalist claims, as we will see in the
Ukrainian case. The following [**empirical analysis** seeks to
**explain** the nature of the **Russian military interventions** in
**Georgia**, **Ukraine**, and **Syria** with reference to two central
aspects: (1) the **gradual escalation** of Russia\'s **objectives** from
the **regional** level to the **global** and (2) the **classification**
of the three military interventions in terms of the **typology of
revisionism** put forward here]{.underline}.

**Russia is [decisively revisionist]{.underline} -- our [typology of
revisionism]{.underline} and predictive, empirical analysis are BOTH
[valuable]{.underline} and [accurate]{.underline}**

[On]{.underline} the [assumptions that changing the status quo is
the]{.underline} basic [aim of a revisionist strategy]{.underline}
(Buzan, 2008) [and]{.underline} that [acceptance of]{.underline} the
[risks]{.underline} involved [in the use of force]{.underline} is a key
factor in [distinguish]{.underline}ing the [different]{.underline} forms
of [revisionism]{.underline} (Schweller, 2015), [this study puts forward
a **new typology** of revisionism]{.underline}. The [six
types]{.underline} identified are [based on three
dimensions]{.underline}: the [**means** employed
(peaceful/violent)]{.underline}, the [nature of]{.underline} the
[**objectives** (territory/norms/power), and]{.underline} the [**level
of action** (regional/global).]{.underline} The [introduction of a new
typology]{.underline} of revisionism can also [**stimulate** further
**research** on]{.underline} the [possible change of goals, means, and
level of action of the potential claims of the revisionist powers that
have economic and military capabilities to act both regionally and
globally to change the status quo]{.underline} (see the case of Russia,
China and, according to some scholars, the United States). [Further
**research insights** can be derived from the **application** of
**normative revisionism** to the various **empirical
cases**]{.underline} (see the Arab countries and the developing).

[Our **empirical analysis**]{.underline}, in particular, [confirms the
**importance** of the **level of action** as a new element]{.underline}
with respect to previous typologies and makes it possible not only [to
demonstrate the **central part** played by the **military option** in
**Russian strategy** inside and outside the post-Soviet space but
also]{.underline} and above all [to **confirm** the **escalation** of
the **revisionist objectives** pursued both at the **regional level**
with the interventions in **Georgia** and **Ukraine**, and at the
**global level** with the intervention in **Syria**.]{.underline} The
[respectively **nationalist** (Georgia and Ukraine) and **radical**
(Syria) nature of the interventions emerges in relation both
to]{.underline} the [means and the level of action of these
interventions, and to the objectives. In Georgia and Ukraine, Russia
obtained the **control** and/or **annexation** of
**territories**]{.underline} like South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Crimea,
[strengthened its position with respect to **neighbouring countries**,
and **impeded** the **expansion** of **NATO** and the EU. In Syria it
obtained control of the port of Tartus, ended the American
monopoly]{.underline} in the war on terrorism [by asserting itself as a
strong party to the peace negotiations, challenged American interests in
the Middle East by strengthening the Assad regime, and clearly
manifested its determination to halt]{.underline} the
[decline]{.underline} that set in after 1989. The [**dual nature** of
Russia\'s objectives -- both **territorial** (**annexation** and/or
**control** over certain areas) and **political** (improvement of
**power** and **prestige** at the **regional** and **global levels**) --
characterized the country\'s **revisionist strategy** as a
whole]{.underline} from August 2008 to March 2016, [confirming the
**importance** of the gradual **increase** in **military
expenditure**]{.underline} and the reforms of the SAP in pursuit of the
same.

If the spectre of the 'end of history\' that hovered over the ashes of
communism was swept away by Putin at the end of the 1990s and the impact
that his long period in power has had on domestic and regional balances
is unquestionable, [what is]{.underline} instead [**still in need** of
**discussion** is the effect that his plan of radical revisionism has
had on the **configuration** of the **international system** as a
whole]{.underline}. As matters now stand, [any talk of **American
decline** at the military level is **misleading** and **empirically
incorrect**. It is]{.underline}, however, [necessary to take the
**readiness** to use military force as our **starting point** if we are
to understand the nature and the **consequences** of **Russian
revisionism** at the global level. A power in a position of hegemony
**cannot** in fact **hesitate** to use all of the diplomatic, economic,
and **military** means at its disposal in order to **preserve its
status** and **prevent** any **destabilizing threats** from calling it
into question.]{.underline} The USA has made systematic use of force
since 1989 to preserve its spheres of influence all over the world and
eliminate threats (from figures like Milosevic, Saddam Hussein, and
Qaddafi) to the stability of the liberal world order on which its
indisputable supremacy rested. Where it intervened militarily, with or
without a resolution of the UN Security Council, it told the rest of the
world that it was the only actor authorized -- or rather self-authorized
-- to intervene in defence, at least formally, of human rights at the
expense of national sovereignty.

Russia\'s revisionism is the child of this strategy. [In order to alter
the status quo in its favour, Putin has operated on at both the regional
and the global levels to **oppose American expansion**]{.underline} in
the post-Soviet space and its version of humanitarian intervention all
over the world, [not hesitating to **use force** in order to challenge
the United States openly and **bend** the **international rules** to
Russia\'s advantage. At the regional level, **Georgia** and **Ukraine**
have been **blocked**. Their entry into the EU and NATO will not be
possible without Russian consent or the risk of a frontal clash with
Moscow]{.underline}.

[At the global level]{.underline}, the effects of Russia\'s strategy
will have to be assessed in the medium and long terms. [Russia has now
revealed its intentions and explicitly threatened the US monopoly in
Syria]{.underline} both in words and in deeds. [It is clearly **not
enough** for Russia to **alter** the **hierarchy of power**. It wants to
obtain acknowledgement of its prestige as a **great power** in both
diplomatic and **military terms**]{.underline}. In other words, [Russia
wants to play a decision-making part once again in the management of
world affairs. It also wants a **less centralized system** offering the
opportunity to **regain** important margins of **power**]{.underline}.

**Appeasement triggers [Russian adventurism]{.underline} which turns
their impacts, withdraws support from Baltic defense, AND
[upends]{.underline} the [international order]{.underline} -- causing
[prolif]{.underline} and [disrupting trade]{.underline}**

Six years ago this week, a war began in Eastern Europe that has
challenged our basic understanding of international aggression. Vladimir
[Putin's **attack on Ukraine** has]{.underline} often [been called a
**hybrid war** due to Moscow's reliance on a confusing cocktail of
**unmarked troops**, **local proxies**, and blanket **disinformation**.
The Kremlin has been careful to stop short of the conventional threshold
for international aggression, but this has not diminished the global
security implications of the conflict]{.underline}. Quite the opposite,
in fact.

The [Russian takeover of Crimea]{.underline} in February 2014 was not
just a tragedy for Ukraine; it [was a **watershed moment** for the
entire post-WWII **international order**. Since annexing Crimea, Putin
has launched an **invasion** of eastern **Ukraine** that has cost over
13,000 lives and displaced millions]{.underline}. He has [dramatically
**escalated**]{.underline} the carnage [in **Syria**, deployed
**non-state forces** everywhere from **Venezuela** and **Libya** to
**Sudan** and the **C**entral **A**frican **R**epublic]{.underline}, and
[**sanctioned** a wave of political **assassinations** across
Europe]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [Russian disinformation]{.underline}
campaigns, [**cyber attacks**, and election meddling have become
everyday facts of life]{.underline}.

[Despite]{.underline} the [**obvious** and **mounting costs** of
**failing to confront** Putin in Crimea]{.underline}, some [world
leaders remain in **denial**. They talk of the need to **improve
relations** with Russia and advocate **compromise** over
**confrontation**, even if this means treating Putin's **imperial
ambitions** as **legitimate grievances**. This approach has produced
**little of value**. After six years of escalating international
insecurity, it is]{.underline} now [time to abandon **attractive
illusions** and acknowledge that **appeasement** only **encourages**
further **Russian aggression**.]{.underline}

We have been here before. Europe's previous attempts to appease a
revisionist power with expansionist ambitions were similarly
well-meaning, but they nevertheless resulted in WWII. Like
[Putin]{.underline}, Hitler also [**rejected** the **international
order**]{.underline} of the day [and sought to create **new
realities**]{.underline} on the ground [through an audacious foreign
policy linked to support for ethnic comrades left stranded abroad by
post-war borders]{.underline}. When the Anschluss with Austria went
ahead unopposed in March 1938, Hitler laid claim to the Sudetenland in
neighboring Czechoslovakia. This led to the Munich Agreement, which has
come to be recognized as the ultimate symbol of appeasement. Within a
matter of months, Czechoslovakia had ceased to exist and a new world war
was underway.

Comparisons with the 1930s are not entirely accurate. Unlike the
abandoned Czechoslovakians, Ukraine refused to surrender in 2014 and has
been opposing Russian aggression militarily for the past six years. Nor
has there been any international attempt to legitimize the Russian
annexation of Crimea as happened with the Sudetenland in Munich. On the
contrary, [the international community]{.underline} has [imposed
sanctions on Russia]{.underline} that have inflicted genuine economic
damage, and has also introduced a number of symbolic measures to
demonstrate its disapproval. However, there are growing indications that
[the resolve to maintain even these modest measures is now
weakening]{.underline}.

Since taking office in early 2017, US President Donald [Trump has
been]{.underline} famously [reluctant to criticize Putin]{.underline}.
Recently, he has [reiterated his
[hope](https://www.rferl.org/a/trump-says-would-be-great-thing-for-russia-ukraine-to-reconcile/30450703.html)
that Ukraine can "make a deal" with Moscow]{.underline}. Meanwhile,
French President Emmanuel [Macron continues to champion a comprehensive
[reset](https://www.france24.com/en/20200215-macron-calls-for-better-long-term-relations-with-russia)
with Russia]{.underline} while seemingly expecting little in return.
Macron is [not alone in this regard]{.underline}. He was only one of
many leading [European politicians]{.underline} to [support Russia's
unconditional return to]{.underline} the Parliamentary Assembly of the
Council of Europe ([PACE]{.underline}) in summer 2019,
[despite]{.underline} Moscow's [refusal to address any of the issues
that first led to Russia's exclusion in 2014]{.underline}.

[The trend continued at the Munich Security Conference]{.underline} in
February 2020. Dubbed the "Davos for diplomats" and seen as the biggest
event on the global security calendar, this year's Conference was
[marked by the high-profile appearance of a
Kremlin-friendly]{.underline} 12-point
[[plan](https://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/group-statement/easlg-twelve-steps-toward-greater-security-in-ukraine-and-the-euro-atlantic-region/)
towards peace in Ukraine that more closely resembled a roadmap for the
country's surrender.]{.underline} The twelfth and final point of this
plan, which called for Russian involvement in the search for a new
Ukrainian national identity, underlined the dangerous absurdity of the
document. To many in Ukraine, [it was also a further sign of the
mounting appetite for a return to business as usual with Russia, even if
this means sacrificing Ukrainian sovereignty and ignoring some of the
most basic principles of international law]{.underline}.

There is much more at stake here than Ukraine's continued existence as
an independent nation. [Efforts to appease Russia are **undermining**
the **entire basis** of the modern **world order**.]{.underline} Instead
of equal justice for all nations regardless of size, [we risk returning
to a world where **might is right** and **powerful nations** are able to
**dominate** **smaller countries** at will.]{.underline} If left
unchecked, [the rise of **lawlessness** in **international affairs**
will have all manner of **disastrous consequences** in areas ranging
from **global trade** to **nuclear non-proliferation**.]{.underline}

To prevent this scenario from unfolding further, [the international
order must be defended in Ukraine]{.underline}, where the breach first
occurred. This defense should include a significant tightening of
sanctions against Russia until the Kremlin begins to demonstrate changes
in its behavior. At the same time, [the international community should
strengthen its support for the Ukrainian military.]{.underline} This
[combination of **rising costs** and growing **deterrence** would send a
**signal of strength** to Moscow while **stopping short** of provoking a
**wider conflict**.]{.underline} As things stand, [the **mixed
messages** currently reaching Russia are all but **guaranteed** to
**encourage** further **adventurism**.]{.underline}

There is no excuse for today's politicians to repeat the mistakes of the
past, regardless of their good intentions. History has already taught us
that appeasement of an aggressor simply does not work. If the lesson of
the 1930s was insufficient, we now have the additional example of the
past six years to refresh memories. Vladimir Putin has demonstrated
again and again that he believes power is more important than
principles. It is up to the international community to prove him wrong.
Failure to do so will have dire consequences for global security in the
decade
