### 1AC -- Techno-Orientalism

#### The language and code of the [Western project]{.underline} produce an [Asianized future]{.underline}, where the Asian Techno-Orient supplants the [aspirations]{.underline} and [anxieties]{.underline} of modern info capitalism, justifying Western dominance. In this state, the Asian body accelerates [past the present]{.underline} and becomes the [mirror]{.underline} of Western futural fears.

These examples perfectly illustrate our definition of
techno-Orientalism: the phenomenon of imagining Asia and Asians in hypo-
or hypertechnological terms in cultural productions and political
discourse.4 **[Techno-Orientalist imaginations]{.underline}** [are
infused with the]{.underline} **[languages]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[codes]{.underline}** [of the technological and the
futuristic]{.underline}. These [developed alongside industrial advances
in the West]{.underline} and have become [part of the **West's project
of securing dominance**]{.underline} [as architects of the future, a
project that requires configurations of the East as the very technology
with which to shape it]{.underline}. [Techno-Orientalist speculations of
an]{.underline} **[Asianized future]{.underline}** [have become ever
more prevalent in the wake of]{.underline} **[neoliberal trade
policies]{.underline}** [that enable]{.underline}d [greater flow of
information and capital]{.underline} between the East and the West.
Substantial criticism of techno-Orientalism emerged in the mid-1990s
when cultural theorists began to trace its manifestations and theorize
its causes and implications. Kevin Morley and David Robins, Toshiya
Ueno, and Kumiko Sato, principal trailblazers of the field, laid much of
the valuable groundwork. Morley and Robins's Spaces of Identity: Global
Media, Electronic Landscapes, and Cultural Boundaries (Routledge, 1995),
in which a definition of "techno-Orientalism" first saw print, remains
the most cited in critical assessments of technological and Orientalist
discourses; however, Ueno has probably written most extensively about
techno-Orientalism as a discursive cultural phenomenon in the era of
what he identifies as the "post-Fordist social environment of
globalization" (223). "T[he basis of Orientalism and xenophobia is the
subordination of Others through a sort of '**mirror of cultural
conceit**,']{.underline}" Ueno explains. "[**The Orient exists in so far
as the West needs it**, because it brings the project of the West into
focus"]{.underline} (223).

Whereas Orientalism, as a strategy of representational containment,
arrests Asia in traditional, and often premodern imagery,
[techno-Orientalism presents a broader, dynamic, and often contradictory
spectrum of images]{.underline}, constructed by the East and West alike,
[of an **"Orient"**]{.underline} [undergoing rapid economic and cultural
transformations]{.underline}. Techno-Orientalism, like Orientalism,
[places great emphasis on the]{.underline} **[project of
modernity]{.underline}**---[cultures privilege modernity and fear losing
their perceived "edge" over others]{.underline}. Stretching beyond
Orientalism's premise of a hegemonic West's representational authority
over the East, techno-Orientalism's scope is much more expansive and
bidirectional, its discourses mutually constituted by the flow of trade
and capital across the hemispheres. As Ueno observes, techno-Orientalism
is first and foremost an effect of globalism. "[If the Orient was
invented by the West]{.underline}," he writes, "[then]{.underline}
**[the Techno-Orient was also invented by the world of information
capitalism]{.underline}**" (228). [Technological
developments]{.underline}, driven by the imperial aspirations and the
appetites of consumerist societies on both sides of the Pacific, [propel
the engines of invention and production. In its wake, Western nations
vying for cultural and economic dominance with Asian nations find in
technoOrientalism an **expressive vehicle for their aspirations and
fears**]{.underline}. Our volume, Techno-Orientalism: Imagining Asia in
Speculative Fiction, History, and Media, documents past and current
constructions of the role of Asia in a technologized future and
critically examines this proliferating phenomenon.

Dr. Fu Manchu illustrates just one way in which techno-Orientalist
imagery pervades Western cultural productions in the early twentieth
century. The [principal locales of techno-Orientalist
projects]{.underline} as they developed in the late twentieth century
[have primarily been Japan and China]{.underline}. Ueno, whose
influential analyses of "Japanimation" in the mid-1990s seeded the field
of technoOrientalist studies, observes, "[In
Techno-Orientalism]{.underline}, **[Japan is not only located
geographically, but]{.underline}** is also projected
**[chronologically]{.underline}**. Jean **[Baudrillard]{.underline}**
once [called Japan a satellite in orbit. Now Japan has been located in
the]{.underline} **[future of technology]{.underline}**" (228). Morley
and Robins put a finer point on the temporal dimension of the spatial
construction: "[If the future is technological, and if technology has
become 'Japanised,' then the syllogism would suggest that the future is
now Japanese, too.]{.underline} **[The postmodern era will be the
Pacific era.]{.underline}** [Japan is the future, and it is a future
that seems to be transcending and displacing Western
modernity]{.underline}" (168).

Whereas Japan's dubious honor as the original techno-Orient was bestowed
in the eighties with the help of the cyberpunk movement, the
techno-Orientalizing of China occurred roughly a decade later.5 China
was not yet a competitor in the global economy in the 1980s, when the
West focused its wary gaze on what it saw as an invasion of Japanese
capital investments and imports into Western economies. [When China was
recognized as a newly industrialized country (NIC)]{.underline} in the
1990s and its influence in the global economy increased, [it, too,
became]{.underline} once again [a target of techno-Orientalist
fashioning]{.underline}. The [**discourse on China's "rise"** in the
U.S. context]{.underline}, **[consistent with techno-Orientalist
contradictions]{.underline}**, [has focused on constructing its people
as a vast, subaltern-like labor force and as a giant consumer market
whose appetite for Western cultural products, if nurtured, could secure
U.S. global cultural and economic dominance]{.underline}. This dual
image of China as both developing-world producers and firstworld
consumers presents a representational challenge for the West: Is China a
human factory? Or is it a consumerist society, like the United States,
whose enormous purchasing power dictates the future of technological
innovations and economies?

[Japan and China]{.underline} are thus signified differently in the
techno-Orientalist vocabulary. [Both are constructed as competitors and
therefore threats to the U.S. economy;]{.underline} but [while Japan
competes with the United States for dominance in technological
innovation, China competes with the United States in labor and
production]{.underline}. To put it in starker terms, Japan creates
technology, but China is the technology. [In the eyes of the West, both
are crucial engines of the future: Japan innovates and China
manufactures]{.underline}. And [as Asia, writ large, becomes a greater
consumerist force than the West]{.underline},6 [its threat/value dualism
commensurately increases]{.underline}. [These differences]{.underline}
in the technological signification of Japan and China [manifest
themselves in the]{.underline} **[fictive forecasts of the Asiantinged
future]{.underline}**. If Japan is a screen on which the West has
projected its technological fantasies, then [China is a screen on which
the **West projects its fears** of being colonized, mechanized, and
instrumentalized in its own pursuit of technological
dominance]{.underline}.

India, another NIC, has also found itself under the techno-Orientalist
gaze as a consequence of U.S. outsourcing practices. As a much maligned
business strategy, outsourcing has provoked extremely negative public
sentiments in the United States. These opinions find expression in a
particular strand of techno-Orientalist discourse that consolidates
China and India as the chief threats to the U.S. service and labor
sectors. These [Asian nations serve as the]{.underline}
**[scapegoats]{.underline}** [for corporate decisions to move service
and manufacturing jobs abroad and bear the brunt of the resulting
xenophobic antipathies]{.underline}. Chinese and Indian workers, for
instance, are routinely portrayed in techno-Orientalist and technophobic
vocabularies; call center employees in India adopt Western Christian
names and mimic the linguistic and idiomatic style of Americans, a
practice so ubiquitous as to be parodied cinematically in romantic
comedies such as Outsourced (2006), conjuring images of Dickian androids
(or Blade Runner's "replicants") who simulate human behavior and
threaten the distinction between "real" and "fake" Americans. Glossy
spreads of endless rows of Chinese workers in corporate factories and
towns in mainstream magazines such as Time and Wired seal the visual
vocabulary of Asians as the cogs of hyperproduction. In the NIC
contexts, [techno-Orientalist discourse constructs]{.underline}
**[Asians as mere simulacra]{.underline}** [and maintains a prevailing
sense of the]{.underline} **[inhumanity]{.underline}** [of Asian
labor---**the very antithesis**]{.underline} [of Western liberal
humanism]{.underline}.

#### The Asian body is rendered [not as human]{.underline}, but as an [exploitable technology]{.underline}. The death of Vincent Chin is an [embodiment]{.underline} of [schizophrenic Western hatred]{.underline} that must dismantle the Oriental [factory machine]{.underline} to reclaim its [personhood]{.underline}, [subjectivity]{.underline}, and [masculinity]{.underline}.

[From the earliest era of Asian peoples in the United States, their
**technical abilities** were both]{.underline} **[lauded]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[erased]{.underline}**. An exemplar is the Chinese
men who composed more than half of the labor force that completed the
transcontinental railroad's western portion over the high Sierra Nevada
mountains to Promontory, Utah, in 1869. [In the campaign to extend the
Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the American Federation of Labor
argued]{.underline} in their publication, Some Reasons for Chinese
Exclusion, Meat vs. Rice, American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism:
Which Shall Survive? (1902[), that the Chinese male body differed
radically from the American male body]{.underline}. The publication
[argued that the Chinese laborer could withstand physical deprivations
that American and European laborers could not]{.underline} (American
Federation of Labor et al. 5, 14, 16, 18). [This constructed
difference]{.underline} **[rationalized discriminatory
policies]{.underline}** against Chinese railroad workers. Meat vs. Rice
did not argue the Chinese had particular technical skills that were
valuable for constructing the transcontinental railroad. On the
contrary, the [publication claimed the Chinese body simply did not
require the conditions of safety, sustenance, and shelter that bodies of
European descendents required]{.underline}. **[Implicit]{.underline}**
in their argument [is a threat to the superior European laborer's way of
life or culture by a kind of]{.underline} **[unfeeling superhuman
antithetical to the West's liberal humanist credo.]{.underline}**

The [U.S. techno-Orientalist imagination is thus rooted in this view of
the]{.underline} **[Asian body]{.underline}** [as a form of]{.underline}
**[expendable technology]{.underline}**---a view that emerged in the
discourse of early U.S. industrialization and continued to evolve in the
twentieth century. In 1982, a twenty-seven-year-old Chinese American
named **[Vincent Chin]{.underline}** [was beaten to death by two white
men in Detroit]{.underline}. [The attackers, Ronald Ebens and Michael
Nitz, were autoworkers in a U.S. auto industry that was losing market
share to Japanese cars]{.underline}. [Though Chin]{.underline}, a
drafter, **[did not work in automobiles]{.underline}**, [Ebens and Nitz
viewed him as representative---]{.underline}indeed, **[an
embodiment]{.underline}**---[of Japanese auto manufacturing]{.underline}
as they beat him with a baseball bat, reminiscent of Americans smashing
Japanese-made cars in reaction to increasing auto imports in the early
1980s.9 The **[callous brutality]{.underline}** [of Chin's death evinces
something]{.underline} **[more than racial hatred]{.underline}**; [Chin
not only was perceived as a convenient stand-in for the Japanese
automotive industry, but]{.underline} [**embodied its
traits**---**unfeeling, efficient, and inhuman**]{.underline}. In Ebens
and Nitz's eyes, they were Luddites striking down the automatons that
had been sent in to replace them. [Techno-Orientalist discourse
completed the project of dehumanizing Vincent Chin by rendering him as
not only a]{.underline} **[racialized Other]{.underline}**, [but
a]{.underline} **[factory machine]{.underline}** [that had to be
**dismantled**]{.underline} [by Ebens and Nitz]{.underline} **[to
reclaim their personhood]{.underline}**, **[subjectivity, and
masculinity]{.underline}**.10 The shock and outrage over Chin's murder
served as a critical rallying cry under which a coalition of
ethnic-specific groups joined as Asian Americans.

In the twenty-first century, the [perceived economic threat of Japan and
its automobiles has given way to China]{.underline}. Despite the fact
that China does not have a particularly strong reputation as a high-tech
nation, [techno-Orientalism's]{.underline} **[robust
flexibility]{.underline}** [allows for seamless transplantation to
another national site]{.underline}. China's rapid economic rise is
largely credited to its vast manufacturing base, which, coupled with
cheap labor and less regulation, has made it an attractive production
location for many tech companies, including Apple and Dell. And although
the vast majority of Chinese cannot afford the iPads and iPhones they
produce, [we see in U.S. media a representational shift, using
techno-Orientalist conventions, transforming Chinese from mindless
workers to sinister agents]{.underline}. For example, in October 2010, a
U.S. PAC called Citizens Against Government Waste uploaded a commercial
titled "Chinese Professor" on YouTube.

Set in Beijing, China a.d. 2030, the commercial depicts a male professor
lecturing in a large hall accompanied by high-tech gadgets. The lecture
consists of conservative talking points regarding the decline of the
United States. As colorful images of fallen nations scroll behind him,
the professor explains, "America tried to spend and tax itself out of a
great recession. Enormous socalled 'stimulus spending,' massive changes
to health care, government takeovers of private industries, and crushing
debt." He concludes, "Of course, we owned most of their debt, so now
they work for us." With echoes of Fu Manchu, the professor smiles
directly into the camera, eliciting his students' mirth. By presenting
the Chinese professor, the students, and the lecture as moving
seamlessly between the lecture hall technology and the tablet screens
that students hold in their laps, this video implies that China now
leads the world in technological production and consumption. The encoded
secondary message of the commercial sidesteps the reality of China's
still developing technological penetration by projecting a present-day
existential fear into a vision of the future, with technology supposedly
rooted in U.S.-based innovation. It is an elegant solution that
effectively alarms the uninformed viewer by using a panAsian
technological conflation to elide reality and implicitly accuse China of
stealing U.S. intellectual property. Thus, although the national actors
and the details are quite different from the automobile industry of the
1980s, we have a similar techno-Orientalist narrative: U.S. jobs and
manufacturing are being stolen by inorganic, technologically infused
persons who threaten not only our economic but humanistic integrity.

SF's techno-Orientalist tendencies have become so common as to merit
incisive parody. The animated series Futurama takes place a thousand
years in the future, and both skewers and pays homage to SF conventions.
In an episode from the sixth season, Futurama depicts the launch of the
new "EyePhone," a jab at Apple's handset, as a pillory of modern
consumerism. The series' white protagonist, Fry, asks a retail clerk of
South Asian descent, "you're from one of those ethnicities that knows
about technology; why is it called an EyePhone?" (Sandoval). Depicted in
the show as having an intelligence level on par with Homer Simpson, Fry
is not meant to be taken seriously, and often acts as a vessel for
twentieth-century ignorance in a progressive future. What is notable in
this exchange is how the producers of Futurama have Fry explicitly
verbalize a familiar techno-Orientalist trope---Asiatic bodies
functioning as gatekeepers, facilitators, and purveyors of technology.
In this episode, the South Asian clerk literally acts as the final node
on the assembly line that has been largely produced by robotic
arms---the clerk reaches through the drapes to pull an EyePhone from a
pile and we see mechanical limbs swinging about the factory. He is an
assembly line automaton with a human skin, and his affectless, bored
intonation belies his true nature as a machine. A less self-aware show
might leave it at that, but Fry's graceless pronouncement underscores
the techno-Orientalist trope, taking SF to task while simultaneously
paying ironic homage to the genre.

This same technologizing convention that Futurama so sharply satirizes
is found in numerous literary works, including David Mitchell's Cloud
Atlas (2004). Mitchell's six stories link together characters and
narratives spanning past, present, and distant future. Consequently,
Mitchell's novel has the unenviable task of repeatedly establishing the
framing for each separate story line. An economical method for quickly
thrusting the reader into the speculative future is to use a
technologized East Asia, as he does in the story "An Orison of
Sonmi-451." The setting of Nea So Copros, the "corpocracy" of what
appears to be a unified Korea sometime after the twenty-second century,
is where we are introduced to our enslaved narrator, Sonmi-451, a cloned
"fabricant" designed to serve in a fast-food restaurant. Mitchell paints
Korea as the setting for high technology, enforced consumption, and
excessive advertising; and his larger social critique lies in the
mirroring of the fabricants who must serve and the "purebloods" who must
constantly consume, a master-slave dialectic that relies on cannibalism,
erased from view, and technology, projected into high visibility.
Sonmi-451 eventually gains self-awareness, knowledge, and power to
create a declaration of rights for enslaved fabricants and oppressed
classes, but only after she reads the classics of Western civilization
(187, 193). Thus, Mitchell's novel reinforces both the perception of
Asia as the definitive site for technophilic and technophobic
speculations of an oppressive future and the view that only a
Western-coded subject can truly realize liberal humanism in such an
environment.

**[Digital spaces]{.underline}** [abound with]{.underline}
**[reinscribed racial tropes]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[stereotypes]{.underline}**; these are [sites in which racialization
is more likely to be reinforced than challenged]{.underline} (Nakamura,
Cybertypes 227). However, we argue that [techno-Orientalist conventions
in new media are complicated by the fact that the medium is closely
associated with Asia on several levels---as a manufacturing base, as a
source of technological innovation, and as a conduit for cultural
exports]{.underline}. In new media, [the Asian subject is perceived to
be, simultaneously, producer]{.underline} (as cheapened labor),
[designer]{.underline} (as innovators), [and fluent
consumer]{.underline} ([as subjects that are "one" with the
apparatus]{.underline}). [This has the effect of]{.underline}
**[schizophrenic significations of the techno-Orientalized
subject]{.underline}** [in the realm of new media]{.underline}---games
in particular. In 2011, for instance, Blizzard Entertainment announced
an expansion pack, called "The Mists of Pandaria," for their immensely
popular MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role playing game) World of
Warcraft. MMORPGs generally have strong roots in the fantasy and SF
genres, which grant room for characters and creatures with attributes
that often reflect racial stereotypes.11 The Asian-themed world of
Pandaria---described as "mysterious" and "ancient"---and its
high-flying, kung-fu-fighting Pandaren---warriors in a nonthreatening
form---continue in the tradition of portraying Asian culture and
subjects as exotic realms to be explored and manipulated. Within the
same game is a curious mirroring of globalization, in which first-world
gamers looking to accrue in-game capital (gold) more quickly hire
gamers---many of whom are young Chinese men---to "farm" gold, thereby
miming offline conditions in which first-world consumers gain
economically by cheapened high-tech labor. At the same time, an
acceptance of the Asian subject's reputed digital literacy brings about
a sense of wonder and even admiration of their gaming skills---the
global rankings of gamers are often dominated by Korean players, for
instance. We question, however, whether that is not another symptom of
the stereotyping of Orientalized cyborg bodies predicated on a presumed
seamlessness with technology.

#### Techno-Orientalism is [pathologizing]{.underline}, rendering Asian bodies as merely [mortal engines]{.underline} of modernity and growth, [less-than-human]{.underline} yet in need of [constant surveillance]{.underline}.

Techno-Orientalism, then, is not so much a narrow discourse marking the
posthuman cybernetic body as distinctly Asian, nor is it about the
latest bleeding-edge widget being assembled by dexterous, scarred
fingers in Guangdong, China---these are instead signifiers of a larger
project. Rather, [we trace the "techno" in techno-Orientalism to
**techne**]{.underline}, [a process instead of literal tool, for
"revealing" a technology's true presence]{.underline} (wesen)
[and]{.underline} **["enframing"]{.underline}** of [the world according
to humankind's vision]{.underline} (Heidegger 3--35). [It
is]{.underline}, in a sense, [a doubling of Orientalism, a means of
constructing and reifying an Occidentalist worldview in a more
sophisticated way]{.underline}. [Techno-Orientalism]{.underline}
accounts for---and then dismisses---[Eastern modernity as both process
and product of dehumanization, of which the West is an economic and
ontological beneficiary]{.underline}; but [should that modernity ever
transition to hypermodernity]{.underline} [(and threat), its
dehumanizing means and ends reaffirm the West's monopoly over liberal
humanism]{.underline}. The speculative narratives of textual and visual
media are the vehicles through which this disciplinary process travels.

[As the American empire wanes---or]{.underline} [**is
reconfigured**---in the West and China rises in the East, the logic of
techno-Orientalism continues to exert its influence]{.underline} over
emerging cultural productions. Recent examples abound: The 2012 remake
of the Philip K. Dick--inspired film Total Recall (1990) redesigns the
cityscape to resemble the Hong Kong skyline; Gary Shteyngart's satirical
Super Sad True Love Story (2010) envisions a future New York City placed
at the precipice of the U.S. economy's implosion and subsequent takeover
by the Chinese; Junot Diaz's postapocalyptic novel in progress, Monstro,
projects the Chinese renminbi replacing the U.S. dollar as the dominant
international currency---a phenomenon predicted by many economic
prognosticators in recent years (Cox). The film Looper's (2012)
speculative sequence was set in Shanghai to signal its futurity; Daniel
Wilson's novel Robopocalypse (2011) contains an obligatory subplot
involving a Japanese roboticist whose love for his android wife leads to
the discovery of a critical component for humanity's survival. These
works continue on a well-trodden path---[[the technoOrientalized]{.mark}
element [is]{.mark}]{.underline}, at times, [an [alien]{.mark}
environment]{.underline}, **[[existential threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[economic [competitor]{.mark}, or [technological bridge]{.mark} [and
always]{.mark}, invariably, [a vehicle through which]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} [Western]{.mark}-encoded [subject]{.mark}
[undertakes]{.mark} \[[their]{.mark}\]]{.underline}~~his or her~~
[[journey]{.underline}]{.mark}. Likewise, this volume has identified and
critiqued numerous examples of uncritical framing: Jason Crum's
scrutinizing of how early radio broadcasts programs underscored Asian
premodernity (Chapter 2); Victor Bascara's investigation into the
erasure of Asian bodies integral in a nineteenth-century work about the
twenty-first century (Chapter 3); Warren Liu's racialization of
temporality (Chapter 4); Abigail De Kosnik's tracing of the sublimation
of race in three techno-Orientalist films (Chapter 6); Jinny Huh's
analysis of the mixed-race imaginarium of Battlestar Galactica (Chapter
7); and Dylan Yeats's exegesis of the historical rhetoric and politics
of Orientalized enemy "bots" in video games (Chapter 9). [[The West
desires Eastern machinery]{.mark} [but resists recognizing]{.mark} the
human toll or a [humanistic center]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Still, there are wrinkles and complications, particularly when
technoOrientalism is appropriated by spaces of counterdiscourse. For
instance, Korean American filmmaker and comic book author Greg Pak
exploits techno-Orientalist logic in Robot Stories (2003), an
exploration of posthumanism, race, and relationships in the guise of a
genre film. Pak's series of vignettes superficially mime
techno-Orientalist tropes---in this case, the dehumanized, machine-like
Asian laborer represented at different points by a ruthless
businesswoman, a software coder with Asperger syndrome, an android, a
disembodied consciousness---and the film proceeds to deconstruct them by
reinscribing the humanity behind each iteration. Robogeisha (2009), a
Japanese film belonging to a subgenre equal parts grotesque and camp,
takes the Western gaze to its logical conclusion. Completely self-aware
and parodic in tone, the film's loose plot centers on two orphaned
sisters who grow up to become cyborg geisha assassins, one of whom ends
up in the thrall of an evil conglomerate. The film's strongly
nationalist and absurdist denouement, in which a corporation plans the
destruction of Mt. Fuji to unite Japan against its enemies, shows how
techno-Orientalist aesthetics can be used for other ends.1 It is on this
front that additional contributors to this volume also scrutinize
deformations of techno-Orientalist discourse: Julie Ha Tran's
examination of William Gibson's fictional geographies reveals an
unexpected critical bidirectionality (Chapter 10); Kathryn Allan's
discussion of Maul and Salt Fish Girl shows how a new subgenre may
recuperate the cybernetic Asian female figure (Chapter 11); Douglas
Ishii's exposition of Joss Whedon's population of Asian artifacts and
depopulation of Asian peoples in his universe creates room for his own
critical intervention (Chapter 13); Tzarina Prater and Catherine Fung
(Chapter 14) reveal how Larissa Lai's Automaton Biographies grants Blade
Runner's Rachael a voice to "talk back" to Ridley Scott's Asian-infused
vision of dystopic Los Angeles; and media artist Nam June Paik's work,
expertly analyzed by Charles Park, operates a similar aesthetic through
which the mechanisms of human creativity and activity are fetishized and
critiqued (Chapter 15).

National and cultural authorship of the discourse notwithstanding, our
historically conscious exegesis indicates that, thus far,
[techno-Orientalism is strongly tied to]{.underline}
**[geopolitics]{.underline}**, **[economics]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[race]{.underline}**, and we see no reason to
suspect that will change. If compelled to speculate, we would first note
the material consequences of a rising consumer class in China---partly a
consequence of neoliberal trade agreements creating favorable
manufacturing conditions--- and how quickly the landscape changes in
response. In some ways, very little work is required to translate
Orientalist tropes: [the invading horde of barbarians is replaced by a
horde of robotic factory workers, kept at a distance by multinational
corporations and shipping routes]{.underline}. [They are]{.underline}
**[uncreative, less than human]{.underline}** (although complicated by
reports of poor working conditions driving some to suicide), [and always
already]{.underline} **[mechanized]{.underline}**---a narrative that
persists even in the realm of leisure, as Steve Choe and Se Young Kim
describe in their analysis of the disparity of rhetoric surrounding
Eastern as opposed to Western gamers (Chapter 8). Still, on closer
examination complications emerge, for while Japan, South Korea,
Singapore, and Taiwan were economic "miracles" of a hypercapitalist
frenzy, the strong role of the communist state cannot be ignored in
China's rise. And lest we are accused of ignoring the rest of Asia, we
note how the outsourcing of high-tech labor to South Asian nations via
information networks may also complicate a techno-Orientalist logic that
is nothing if not supple and elastic. One emerging commonality we
detect---and we are curious to see how this will be integrated into
cultural discourse that must discipline---is the role of pollution in
developing nations as manufacturing booms. Already, news reports teem
with stories of poor air quality over the largest metropolitan cities in
China, Beijing in particular. It may be that [the techno-Orientalized
subject may take on an ecocritical slant]{.underline}, as we begin to
move away from cyberspace-oriented discourse characterizing the future
as ephemeral and diaphanous; instead, it may be [polluted, riddled with
the detritus of ex-gen technology, haunted by the specter of Asian
manufacturing]{.underline} (indeed, already a hallmark of post-cyberpunk
tropes). The message conveyed by the rhetoric of "pollution" is that
[even as Asia has finally reached modernity, it does so irresponsibly,
without regard for the supposed lessons learned by the West during its
periods of rapid industrialization]{.underline} over the course of the
twentieth century. The final irony, then, is while the human toll in
Asia can be effaced from Western consciousness, environmental pollutants
traveling over wind and water currents more efficient than any shipping
route will persist, leading to inescapable, catastrophic effects on a
global scale. [Asia's major economies]{.underline}--- Japan, China,
South Korea, and India---[are, in the eyes of the West, behaving like
recalcitrant children, refusing to abide by its tutelage, insisting on
growing up too quickly, and thus warranting its **constant
surveillance**.]{.underline}

If Seo-Young Chu is correct in characterizing stereotypes as "a
technology meant to facilitate mental shortcuts" (Chapter 5), then
[techno-Orientalism has become a technology that facilitates
the]{.underline} **[containment]{.underline}** [of a perceived mass
threat]{.underline}. **["We all create images of things we fear or
glorify,"]{.underline}** writes Sander Gilman in his extended
psychoanalytic study of stereotypes. But while some of us retain the
capacity to recognize the distinction between the individual and the
stereotyped class, Gilman explains, ["\[t\]he pathological
personality]{.underline} does not develop this ability, and [sees the
entire world in terms of the rigid lines of difference. The pathological
personality's mental representation of the world supports the need for
the line of difference]{.underline}, whereas for the nonpathological
individual the stereotype is a momentary coping mechanism, one that can
be used and then discarded once anxiety is overcome. The former is
[consistently aggressive toward the real people and objects to which the
stereotypical representations correspond]{.underline}; the latter is
able to repress the aggression and deal with people as
individuals["]{.underline} (18). The prospect that such "aggressions"
will abate remains nil, however, partly because [the "individual" is by
now a quaint notion of a bygone American cultural
mythology]{.underline}, and partly due to the West's perception of Asia
as historically and persistently collectivist. Drawing on Gilman's
formulation, then, **[techno-Orientalism is a form of
pathology]{.underline}**, [necessitated by the]{.underline} **["Rising
East" rhetoric]{.underline}** [and rationalized by the neoliberal logic
of (Asian) humans as **mortal engines** of modernity and economic
growth]{.underline}. Thus, techno-Orientalist studies must be vigilantly
developed and deployed as a critical countertechnology for negotiating
the complex, taut lines of a discourse ensconced in racial and
international politics.

#### Antagonized by the project of [Western imperialism]{.underline}, Asian subjectivity is in a [constant state of flux]{.underline}, pushed to the [periphery]{.underline} of Empire in [nonlinear spatiotemporalities]{.underline} under modernity's [anxious securitization]{.underline}.

The ways in which [techno-Orientalism manifests in]{.underline} Asia are
predicated on Cold War logics, a kind of **[Western militarized
violence]{.underline}**. Jodi Kim (2010) finds in Ends of Empire that
[the Cold War brought **spatial and temporal distinctions for racialized
Asian bodies**]{.underline} [via proxy wars]{.underline}. [The United
States' relationship with Asian nations is overdetermined by the events
of that era]{.underline}: "The Cold War, [as a geopolitical, cultural,
and epistemological project of gendered racial formation and imperialism
undergirding U.S. global hegemony]{.underline}" (Kim, 2010, p. 4). The
United States' investment in nations like South Korea, Japan, and
Vietnam is predicated on Western interests in the geopolitical sphere.
[The United States rebuilt Japan after World War II as a means of
gaining capital and hegemonic power, which is a **neo-imperialist** and
**gendered** project that undergirds U.S.-Japan relations]{.underline}.
Okinawa is a focal point for empires to collide---Japan's settlement and
the US military occupation---both of which have brought genderbased
violence to indigenous Okinawans (Yoneyama, 2015). [The racialized,
gendered dynamic produces a taxonomy of Asian subjectivity in that
**Asians are tools for the West**. Within hegemonic systems, Asian women
are **pushed to the periphery of Empire**]{.underline}. [Their
subservience and domination are used to further]{.underline}
**[neo-colonial, white, hegemonic, masculine interests]{.underline}**,
which is [evident in the advent of comfort women and the military sex
industry]{.underline} (Yoneyama, 2015). [Western nations, specifically
white men, are invested in Asia because they perceive themselves
as]{.underline} **["saving"]{.underline}** [Asian women from an
Orientalized depiction of violent Asian men, which propagates a
racialized and heteronormative notion of Asia]{.underline} (Park, 2012).
The [political and economic rise of Asian principalities]{.underline}
such as China, Japan, and India [transform Oriental epistemologies via
a]{.underline} **[disruption of white hegemonic power]{.underline}**. In
the attempt of Asian nations to secure capital, **[security anxieties
manifest]{.underline}** [from white fears of]{.underline} emasculation
or [the loss of power]{.underline}. [In a discursive response to
maintain international white supremacy, a new form of othering
occurs]{.underline} (Park, 2012; Agathangelou, 2016).

Thus, [Cold War logics]{.underline} **[spectrally
transform]{.underline}**, **[haunt]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[underlie techno-Orientalism]{.underline}**. **[Asian subjectivity is
always within a state of flux]{.underline}** [or being and exists
in]{.underline} **[nonlinear spatiotemporalities]{.underline}** [as a
result of Western modernities]{.underline}:

the Cold War between capitalism and communism is actually a "civil war"
within the selfsame Western modernity. As Odd Arne Westad argues, both
the United States and the Soviet Union saw themselves as the successors
of Western modernity and, the Cold War was waged over which one would be
the sole rightful successor, and would thus be able to articulate its
own conception of Western modernity and attempt to universalize it.
(Kim, 2010, p. 24)

The [spectral violence that manifests in Cold War logics,
techno-Orientalism, and racial capitalism finds its origin in
**modernity itself**]{.underline}. Thus, the Cold War is [a lynchpin for
the neoliberal era]{.underline}. The [revitalization of specific Asian
nations becomes a means of]{.underline} **[securing new means of
neoliberal production]{.underline}**. [Asian countries]{.underline},
specifically in Southeast Asia, [are]{.underline} **[locked in Cold War
temporalities]{.underline}** [due to their history of colonization and
neo-colonial geopolitical relationship with the West]{.underline}.5 Yet
[within]{.underline} new [technologized nations]{.underline}, [racial
capitalism produces industries such as sweatshops and call centers,
equating Asian subjectivity with technology]{.underline} (Roh et al.,
2015).

#### Representations of Chinese cyberwar creates a [false threat]{.underline} of a techno-Orientalized "Other" that cultivates [stable]{.underline}, [Americanized proponents]{.underline} of hegemony.

Homefront illustrates the ongoing [[mass-market cultural work]{.mark} of
reproducing and [repackag]{.mark}ing [aggressive U.S. policy objectives
into]{.mark} **[feel-good defenses of the "American
Way]{.mark}."**]{.underline} Many analysts claim that [wealthy,
industrialized, and technologically innovative]{.underline} South Korea
[can protect itself,]{.underline} [but]{.underline} that
[tensions]{.underline} with the North [provide a convenient rationale
for permanently stationing fifty thousand U.S. troops there]{.underline}
(Cumings). **[[Aggressive]{.mark} American [war games]{.mark} in the
Yellow Sea [use]{.mark} the [supposed threat of]{.mark} [North
Korea]{.mark} as a stand-in for [China]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the true
target of such military posturing in the region. Homefront's developers
initially sought to cast China as its invading force (Totilo, "**[China
Is Both Too Scary and Not Scary Enough]{.underline}**"), but also found
in North Korea an easy enemy against which players can justly, and
safely, act out their aggression. However, Homefront is also a remake of
the 1984 film Red Dawn, where a patriotic band of American teenagers
rebel against an occupying Soviet army. MGM Studios literally remade Red
Dawn in 2010 with the Chinese in place of the Soviets---but studio
executives decided to shelve the project after it was filmed in order to
digitally remake the Chinese invaders into North Koreans (Fritz and
Horn), releasing a heavily reedited version in November 2012. The
"original" Red Dawn was itself something of a remake as part of a
broader campaign to fancifully revive the Cold War hysteria of the
1950s. By hailing the perpetual war-(re)making at the heart of the
"America" they seem to celebrate, this family of texts expresses a deep
ambivalence about the role of screen enemies in this process. Rather
than distract from this ideological work, such ambivalence animates
their cultural power and political resonance. Excavating the genealogy
of Homefront and its [imaginative]{.underline} [reworking]{.underline}
[of U.S. foreign policy rhetoric can help elucidate the "techno" in the
term "techno-Orientalism]{.underline}."
**[[Techno-Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** describes texts that
**[[produce]{.mark} [visions of]{.mark} the purportedly [technologically
sophisticated economies and peoples of East Asia as]{.mark} [foils for
Western anxieties about]{.mark} the [digital]{.mark} or information
[age]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Homefront and the 2012 remake of Red Dawn
register these anxieties quite precisely. In both texts [North Koreans
use]{.underline} an [[e]{.mark}lectro[m]{.mark}agnetic [p]{.mark}ulse to
[disable]{.mark} the [communication systems]{.mark} upon which the U.S.
military depends]{.underline}, and the invaders quickly take much of
America. This techno-Orientalist peril is reminiscent of James Hevia's
reading of the early twentieth-century Dr. Fu Manchu novels. Hevia
argues that the "Devil Doctor's" ability to repurpose the knowledge
infrastructure underpinning the British Empire for his own nefarious
plots is what makes the character so scary. Homefront and Red Dawn
continue this tradition of [reworking anxieties about the reliance on a
fetishized notion of information dominance by fixating on Oriental
villains who upset the fantasy of Western technological
supremacy]{.underline}. In the context of mounting media **[[fixation on
cyber-security]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[driven]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in part **[[by]{.mark} [political projects to depict
China]{.mark}]{.underline}** (I mean, North Korea) **[[as]{.mark}
[trying to hack America out]{.mark} [of its role]{.mark} [as]{.mark}
[military]{.mark}-technology [leader]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Singel),
the fears expressed in the 2012 Red Dawn in particular illustrate the
anxious stakes of techno-dominance. The occupying North Koreans have
their own communications network, and the film's plot is driven by a
hunt to retrieve one of the invaders' radios, so the forces regrouping
in Free America can reverse engineer it. However, the film explores the
ramifications of this technological upset through the ambivalent specter
of the U.S. war in Iraq. [Without computer guidance systems or satellite
telecommunications, the occupied Americans are reduced to the status of
Iraqis, dependent upon a technologically superior invading force that
claims to be their friend.]{.underline} The invading North Koreans tout
that they have come to liberate Americans from their own failed leaders,
but they will not tolerate insurrection. This won't do for the
Wolverines who launch the resistance using the moniker of their high
school mascot. Jed, a veteran who has just returned from Iraq, convinces
his budding guerrilla troops that they have an advantage. The occupiers,
he knows from experience, don't really want to be there, whereas the
Wolverines are fighting for their home and freedom. Jed claims that both
the Viet Cong and America's Founding Fathers knew that guerrilla tactics
could drive imperialists away by wearing them down. In this way, the
2012 Red Dawn seems to suggest a deeply ambivalent circular logic. The
North Koreans serve as a harbinger for America. [**Should American
military technology fail, America will be occupied the way it has
occupied others**. But in the hands of the film's enemy Orientals,
America's own strategy is revealed to be terrifying and immoral; and
given the U.S. experience in Iraq (and Vietnam) we know that this
occupying technology cannot succeed.]{.underline} The overlapping and
contradictory identifications expressed in Red Dawn and Homefront
between Iraqis, North Koreans, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Russians (and
the list could, and does, go on) illustrate the polymorphous Orientalism
at play in these texts. This displacement of enmity [reflects a broader
tradition of American war-gaming]{.underline}. Red Dawn (2012) producer
Tripp Vinson stated he was interested in remaking the 1984 original
because he had enjoyed it as a kid and thought "**[the [idea]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} an [invading army]{.mark} is something that [speaks to the
American psyche]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (Hasan). However, [**[the
American psyche is not static]{.mark}**, [but continually]{.mark}
reproduced, remade, and [cultivated]{.mark} [by]{.mark} [image]{.mark}
[makers backed]{.mark} by the power of the [state]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Since World War II, [**[politicians]{.mark}** and pundits have
**[used]{.mark} the [specter of "Oriental]{.mark}" [enemy]{.mark}
invasions [to scare Americans into]{.mark} defending themselves**
against a succession of intractable foes **by [embracing]{.mark} the
emancipatory promise of [military technology]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[Defenders and definers of America have replaced Soviet communism with
new archenemies across East Asia and the Middle East]{.underline}.
**[[Cyberwar]{.mark} has [replaced the Space
Race]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The ease of this transition suggests how
the shifting goals of [U.S. policy]{.mark}]{.underline}, not any
overarching immutable cultural or geostrategic affinity **[[across the
"Orient]{.mark}," [shape how Americans understand]{.mark} the implicit
"[Eastern]{.mark}" [threats]{.mark} [to]{.mark} an [imagined
"West]{.mark}."]{.underline}** This complements Edward Said's central
contention that [the Orient is not a real place]{.underline} that
experts in the West analyze: **[[the Orient is a
fantasy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[produced by analysts]{.mark} with the
power to assert its existence]{.underline}. Adding
"[[techno]{.underline}]{.mark}" to [[Orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[registers]{.mark} the [embeddedness]{.mark} [of]{.mark} such
[civilizational logic]{.mark} with[in]{.mark} the sixty-year
[American]{.mark} struggle for [military industrial
techno-dominance]{.mark} in the supposedly epic contest over the fate of
the world]{.underline}. As remakes, Red Dawn and Homefront hint at their
participation in the [ongoing reproduction of techno-Orientalist
militarism at the heart of the U.S. political culture]{.underline}.
These texts [hail a tradition of attacking Americans in order to
convince them they are, or could be, under attack from so-called
Orientals]{.underline}. Key to this tradition of making and remaking
techno-Orientalist militarism were a succession of groups named the
Committee on the Present Danger (CPD). In 1950, a group of establishment
elites founded the first CPD to promote the military to foster an
"American Century" rooted in free trade by challenging Soviet attempts
to close off global markets. To do so, this CPD depicted the Soviet
threat to America as a zero-sum game. Behind closed doors in Washington,
the CPD stewarded the adoption of the secret NSC-68 memoranda shortly
before the Korean War. NSC-68 was the ultimate [techno-Orientalist
document, describing the Soviet Union as a "fanatical," "intractable,"
"inescapably militant" enemy "antithetical" to the existence of freedom
and Western "civilization]{.underline}" (Pietz). NSC-68 advocated
removing Cold War strategy from congressional oversight and placing it
squarely in the charge of a vastly expanded military to develop a
technological supremacy that could bolster freedom and counter communism
any- and everywhere. **[Under the banner of anticommunism Americans
launched a program of mutually assured destruction and the development
of brutal countersubversive campaigns at home and abroad]{.underline}**
(Sanders 23--50).

But by the 1970s this techno-Orientalist vision began to crumble under
its own weight (Englehardt). All the sophisticated surveillance and
targeting seemed unable to win in Vietnam or America. Revelations about
the existence of NSC-68 and the extra-legal activities it fostered
provoked widespread distrust in the military establishment. The growing
sense at that time that the desperate pursuit of anticommunism was
neither possible nor healthy for American society led to the embrace of
détente with first China and then the Soviet Union. However, [hawkish
politicians and defense analysts]{.underline} who were [being pushed out
of the military establishment founded a second CPD]{.underline} in 1976
[to remake Orientalist fears, and revive the promise that technology
could defend against them]{.underline}, in order to reassert their
declining influence (Cahn). This is the all-too-real backstory to
Homefront and the Red Dawns.

The second CPD sought to pathologize the movement away from
technoOrientalist militarism by helping popularize a term supposedly
coined by Henry Kissinger: the "Vietnam Syndrome." In the fallout
following the retreat from Vietnam, mainstream commenters began to argue
that the zealous assault on communism had led analysts to misunderstand
the situation in Vietnam and to wrongly imagine that ever escalating
carpet bombing and computer-aided strategy could defeat a popular
insurgency united against a foreign occupying power (Edwards 113--145).
But advocates of the "Vietnam Syndrome" countered that this critique of
techno-Orientalist truisms was naïve and even dangerous.
[Neoconservatives sought to refocus American fears on the Soviet Union
to revive the]{.underline} [**imagined political and moral clarity** of
the]{.underline} anticommunist and [militaristic 1950s]{.underline}. To
this end, the second CPD argued that Soviet overtures for détente and
arms reduction were in fact strategic deceptions. They claimed that by
focusing on the Soviets' "capabilities rather than his intentions, his
weapons rather than his ideas, motives, and aspirations," even the CIA
vastly underestimated the Soviet threat to America (qtd. in Cahn 163).
CPD Sovietologist Richard Pipes argued that the American tendency to
"mirror image" blinded analysts and the public from realizing that the
Soviet "totalitarian mindset" was not "guided merely by self-serving
motives," but instead dedicated to world domination by any means (6--7).
Such rhetoric [suggested that American obliviousness to the fundamental
difference of their Eastern foes left the United States vulnerable to a
surprise attack]{.underline}.

The second CPD's **[remade Cold War]{.underline}** [sought
to]{.underline} not only rollback Soviet communism but also [challenge
the various "countercultures" that emerged in response to the Vietnam
War]{.underline}. The CPD argued that [it was not flawed
technoOrientalist policies that left sixty thousand American soldiers
and one-fifth of the Vietnamese population dead with no strategic gain,
but a fundamental weakness in American resolve.]{.underline} To this end
the second CPD celebrated emerging presidential contender (and former
CPD member) Ronald Reagan's campaign pledge to "rearm America." Reagan
and the CPD relentlessly criticized President Jimmy Carter's embrace of
détente and arms reduction as epitomizing the dangerous malaise at the
heart of the "Vietnam Syndrome," and handily won the presidency in 1980.
Once president, Reagan installed nearly fifty fellow CPD members into
the White House. Reagan appointed Pipes to a staff position on the
National Security Council where he argued that [revolutionaries from
Northern Ireland, Iran, Palestine, and across Africa and Latin America
were not the products of local conflicts exacerbated by
American]{.underline} and Soviet [intervention but were]{.underline}
instead [all agents of a global conspiracy directed by
Moscow]{.underline}. The renewed embrace of proxy wars and nuclear
buildup that followed led to some of Reagan's lowest approval ratings,
but CPD-allied advisors encouraged Reagan to whip up excitement for a
renewed Cold War (Sanders 277--342). To do so, Reagan delved even
further into policies rooted in techno-Orientalist fantasy.

Reagan's background as an actor and anticommunist crusader gave his
administration a perceptive sensitivity to narrative that allowed him to
revive the oppositional civilizational logic of Orientalism and the
redeeming promise of military technology (Rogin). Speaking at Disney
World's future-oriented EPCOT theme park on March 8, 1983, the president
stated, "\[W\]atch a 12-year-old take evasive action and score multiple
hits while playing 'Space Invaders,' and you will appreciate the skills
of tomorrow's pilot." That night, Reagan sought to paint the arms race
as a moral act in an address to the National Association of
Evangelicals. The president asserted that the world was divided between
good and evil and that American disarmament would abandon Christianity
to the threat of communism and reward "the aggressive impulses of an
evil empire." Two weeks later [Reagan sought to make]{.underline} the
[revived prospect of nuclear war less terrifying by
announcing]{.underline} on television, and without consulting the
Defense Department, [a billion-dollar Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)
to build a computerized shield to protect Americans from Soviet
missiles]{.underline} that might be launched in response to Reagan's
renewal of the arms race. [The]{.underline} **[fantastic
technology]{.underline}** [of the SDI would allow the United States to
assert **global military dominance**]{.underline} [without risking
nuclear annihilation]{.underline}. Most [analysts and academics
considered SDI]{.underline} (or "Star Wars" as it was termed in the
media) **[scientifically impossible]{.underline}**. Many commentators
noted that Reagan's SDI proposals were [eerily similar to
the]{.underline} plot of one of the president's earliest films, Murder
in the Air (1940), about [a weapon that "not only makes the United
States invincible in war, but in so doing promises to be the greatest
force for world peace ever discovered"]{.underline} (Boyer 205). But
this did not stop the administration from opening nearly unlimited
funding channels for developing the proposed military technology.

#### Thus, we engage the [Asiatic Diaspora]{.underline} in a [methodological praxis of refusal]{.underline}. Through diasporic [melancholia]{.underline}, [insurgent memories]{.underline} and [counterknowledge]{.underline}, we find space for [productive refusal]{.underline} against the [Western hegemonic gaze]{.underline} that empowers [transnational Asian solidarity]{.underline}.

Kim (2010) articulates a **[methodological praxis]{.underline}** to
challenge these systems of domination through her theorization [of Asian
American cultural production]{.underline}:

Asian American culture [as]{.underline} also **[engaging in a politics
of refusal]{.underline}**. [In refusing the **seductive will** to total
knowledge or revelation of the "truth" of the "Asian American
experience," what it means to be Asian American, or what the United
States "really did" in Asia during the Cold War, Asian American culture
enact]{.underline} what in anthropological term has been called
"**[ethnographic refusal]{.underline}**" (Kim, 2010, p. 6)

Although Kim's (2010) work is germane to notions of America, it is also
produced through a transnational lens. [Applying]{.underline} her work
[to the]{.underline} **[Asiatic Diaspora]{.underline}** [as a whole, we
begin to understand how we can]{.underline} **[collectively
work]{.underline}** [to produce counter-hegemonic
resistance]{.underline}. Additionally, [as Asian scholars located within
the United States, our frame of analysis cannot be separated from our
positionality which begins these points of inquiry. Diaspora produces
a]{.underline} **[condition of melancholia]{.underline}** [from loss
which can be described as a process of]{.underline}
**[subjectivization]{.underline}** [because loss is an overdetermined
sense of self]{.underline} (Eng, 2010). [Diasporic Asian cultural
production thus]{.underline} **[rejects and critiques]{.underline}**
[gendered and racialized quotidian violence]{.underline}. [It
is]{.underline} a **[refusal to become respectable and docile
subjects]{.underline}**. It is a refusal [to have Asians be flattened
and made into technocratic tools]{.underline}. It is a refusal [to
be]{.underline} **[integrated within liberal multicultural
institutions]{.underline}**. It is a refusal [to be consumed by the
white masculine hegemonic gaze]{.underline}. Furthermore, [it attempts
to bridge, build, and empower Asians across many geographic locations
brought by diaspora]{.underline}. Diasporic Asian cultural production
attempts to build [transnational solidarity]{.underline}.
Transnationality, here, comes from Lisa Yoneyama (2015) in Cold War in
Ruins:

...transnationality means much more than mere movements across
nation-states, borders, or exchanges among multiple national actors and
locations. It [comprises of]{.underline} **[insurgent
memories]{.underline}**, **[counterknowledge]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[inauthentic identities]{.underline}** [that have
been regimented by the discourse and institution center on
nation-state]{.underline}. (p. 7)

[Such cultural production is a]{.underline} "**[productive
refusal]{.underline}**." Transnationalism is about [producing radical
connections within diaspora and across national borders through
counter-hegemonic praxis;]{.underline} it is about [the ability to
produce new forms of sociality and liberatory visions for such a
heterogeneous group]{.underline}. For Sawayama, transnationality is
**[rooted in]{.underline}** her production of **["inauthentic"
code]{.underline}** which is [scripted by Western modernity and
diaspora]{.underline}.

serves as this essay's epigraph, excite what Alan Greenspan once called
"[irrational exuberance]{.underline}." Uttered in a speech Greenspan
gave in 1996, in his capacity as chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve,
the phrase characterized the "unduly escalated asset values" of Japan's
economic bubble. The next day, Tokyo's stock market fell sharply,
closing 3 percent down, and Greenspan's speech largely presaged the
Asian financial crash a year later. The extent to which [economic
projections hang on the words of figureheads]{.underline} like Alan
Greenspan demonstrates how such **[[speculations]{.mark} [work as
performative speech acts]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [call]{.mark} the [future
into being]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Similarly, the [optimism]{.underline}
Mahbubani announces [in forward-looking, prophetic tones ("optimism will
deliver the Asian Century]{.underline}"), **[[affectively]{.mark}
[structures]{.mark} speculative [investment in Asian
futures]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This **[vision of the new Asian
hemisphere, colonized by empty high-r­ises reaching toward limitless
horizons and built by deterritorialized workers]{.underline}**,
**[projects a future of automated speculative building, fueled by
investment hungry banks]{.underline}**. If Greenspan and Mahbubani both
grasp how [their]{.underline} [respective declarations of pessimism and
optimism]{.underline} will affect the global economy, [they do so with
two different Asias in mind]{.underline}: [Japan of the late 1990s and
Singapore at the dawn of a "new Asia" in 2008]{.underline}. 2 The
**[[so]{.mark}-[called]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[Asian
Century]{.underline}**]{.mark}, toward which Mahbubani's optimism
strains, **[[functions]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a largescale [speculative
fiction spawned from neoliberal fantasies]{.mark} that capitalize on a
literary genre's already problematic investments [in]{.mark}
[techno-Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In their 1995 examination of
techno-Orientalism, David Morley and Kevin Robins call attention [to
U.S. and European fantasies of Japan a]{.underline}nd its
[shift]{.underline} in those imaginaries in the [1980s from an exotic
playground to a land of emotionless automatons]{.underline}. Perhaps
epitomized by Western dystopian cyberpunk such as Ridley Scott's Blade
Runner (1982) and William Gibson's Neuromancer (1984),
[techno-Orientalism figures the Japanese as "unfeeling aliens; they are
cyborgs and replicants]{.underline}. But there is also the sense that
[these mutants are now better adapted to survive in the
future]{.underline}"(170). While Morley and Robins understand
**[[techno-Orientalism]{.mark} as primarily [born out of Western
anxieties about]{.mark} Japan's]{.underline}** **[[challenge to U.S.
economic heg]{.mark}emony]{.underline}**, they also suggest more
specifically how [techno-Orientalism arises just as Japan emerges as
"the largest creditor and the largest net investor in the
world"]{.underline} (153). What Morley and Robins never fully develop,
and what I want to explore in more depth here, is this coordinated turn
toward Asian futures in both financial and cultural forms of
speculation. [Mathematical [models]{.mark} of probability [and]{.mark}
[investment]{.mark} strategies based on extrapolation [are]{.mark} forms
of **[speculative fiction that project finance capitalism's visions of
futurity onto the world]{.mark}**. Interdisciplinary scholarship from
the past two decades has pointed to the performative aspects of economic

as derivatives and debt bundling]{.underline} (LiPuma and Lee),
[and]{.underline} the "[financialization of daily life]{.underline}"
(Martin). Because **[[speculative economies rely]{.mark} ever more

[co-constitutive relationship between the cultural production and
financial worlding of Asian futurity]{.underline}. A peculiar question
arises then, when Asian economic and political architects themselves
participate in the projection of Asian futurity, all the while drawing
on a techno-Orientalist toolkit. I argue that [[critical analysis
of]{.mark} the [discursive site of Asian futurity]{.mark}
[reveals]{.mark} [points of contradiction]{.mark} in American
neoliberalism as it travels that have to do with earlier forms of racial
and colonial subjugation providing the scaffolding for the architecture
of neoliberalism itself.]{.underline}3 As Asia develops its own
neoliberal rhetoric, articulating its own futurity poses certain
problems that necessitate a disavowal of the racism of
techno-Orientalism. [What stands in to "[smooth]{.mark}" that difficulty
is **the [heteronormativ]{.mark}ity** **[techno-Orientalism]{.mark}**
always **[espoused]{.mark}** that **[Asian futurity]{.mark} posits anew
[as part of its road map]{.mark}**, capitalizing on aspirational
teleologies, valuations of privatized worth, and nationalisms
consolidated through processes of racialization.]{.underline} I focus my
investigation on techno-Orientalism's role in the production ofa global
neoliberal subject in contemporary Singapore, where a tech economy
adopts and adapts localized versions of seemingly universalized notions
of "the good life." Building on Lauren Berlant's theorization of "cruel
optimism," this essay levies a [critique of "the Asian Century" as
imagined by economists around the world]{.underline}. It argues that a
revisionist [Asian futurity needs to [intervene in]{.mark} the
[neoliberal orientations of "the good]{.mark}
[life]{.mark}]{.underline}" and, [in the face of foreclosed futures,
[open possibilities of]{.mark} what Eve Sedgwick has called "[reparative
practices]{.mark}]{.underline}." For an inspiring glimpse of what
reparative practice sin the context of techno-Orientalism might look
like, I turn to Sonny Liew's graphic story collection Malinky Robot
(Figure12.1), which fabulates an alternative imagining of Asian
futurity, as told from the perspective of the global South. Malinky
Robot, a title that translated serendipitously from Russian as "odd
jobs," or "little work" (Villarica), depicts a multiethnic Asian
futurity burdened with precarious living conditions, precipitous divides
in wealth, and ecological as well as economic fallout propagated by
global capitalist greed. Liew, born in Malaysia but working mostly out
of Singapore, offers gritty, agitated aesthetics and sparse storylines
that restore texture, abrasion, and friction to the slick, polished
surfaces and epic narrative scales of techno-Orientalist futures. Liew's
personal trajectories map a complex history of Singapore as a site of
multiple layers of European (Portuguese, Dutch, British) and Japanese
imperialism. In its turn toward self-governance, Singapore has also been
the scene of ethnic and class-based tensions among exploited Malaysian
workers and a predominantly Chinese ethnic majority population who
constitute the managerial class. With particular attention to
Singapore's own aspirations to become a "technopreneurial" city-state of
the future (Ong, Neoliberalism 181), this essay looks to Malinky Robot
as a crucial **[[counternarrative to
techno-Orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** as [it is deployed not only by
Western fantasies of a docile East but also by Asian
aspirations]{.underline} to [**[challenge U.S. global

#### Debate relies on a [speculatory process]{.underline} to predict and predetermine Asian futures -- only [critical readings]{.underline} and [alternative imaginings]{.underline} of Asian futurity can form [ruptures]{.underline} in the smooth flow of oriental logics.

In an essay called "Angels in Digital Armor: Technoculture and Terror
Management" (2010), media scholar Marcel O'Gorman argues that **[notions
of heroism]{.underline}** [in contemporary technoculture aim to satisfy
two primary]{.underline} **[existential needs]{.underline}**:
[the]{.underline} **[desire for recognition and the denial of
death]{.underline}**. Most video games interpellate players by
reinforcing ideologies that underpin the sovereign subject, who believes
herself to be immortal and master of the world represented on the
computer screen. Gaming is one part of a broadly conceived digital
technoculture for O'Gorman. Appropriating Bernard Stiegler's thesis that
[the technologization of culture is linked to]{.underline} **[profound
malaise]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[ontological
indifference]{.underline}**, O'Gorman argues that online [heroism,
constituted through attention garnered]{.underline} on Facebook,
YouTube, and the news media, [goes hand in hand with the]{.underline}
**[disavowal of mortality]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[finitude]{.underline}**. Toward this O'Gorman analyzes cases of gamer
death in China and Korea, the Columbine High School shootings, and Cho
Seung-Hui, the Virginia Tech shooter, as "explicitly technological, or
even 'cyber,' because they involve the perpetrators' use of media to
rehearse or to promote their exploits in a desperate plea for
recognition" (O'Gorman). He does not discuss race explicitly but implies
that all users of digital media are somehow implicated.

While we agree with O'Gorman's diagnosis of the culture of online
celebrity and the proliferation of technically induced malaise, his
analysis runs the danger of overgeneralization with the blanket term
"technoculture." We would like to attend to the specificity of video
gaming and its Orientalist figuration by isolating a mechanic of
StarCraft that is common to most video games: the acquisition of
capital. More specifically, for the remainder of the essay we further
interrogate the relationship between work and play. While drawing from
McKenzie Wark's Gamer Theory and key game play mechanics from StarCraft,
we argue that [extreme video gaming may be read to]{.underline}
**[challenge]{.underline}** the **[presuppositions]{.underline}** [that
deem it]{.underline} **["unproductive"]{.underline}**
[labor]{.underline}. In doing so, we argue that **[extreme gaming upends
notions of capitalist time, pointing to ontological aporias that blur
the distinction between Occidental and Oriental]{.underline}**.

[Playing StarCraft teaches its players about life outside of the
game]{.underline}, a testament perhaps to its broader relevance,
[training them to become better capitalists]{.underline}. Because of the
cutthroat level of competition and the constant influx of new talent,
professional gamers in Korea mostly enjoy short careers that are
abbreviated by mandatory military service. After being discharged from
the military, pro gamer Lee Joong Heon was employed at a video game
company. But after a five-year retirement, Lee, formerly a Warcraft III
player, decided to return to eSports and made the transition to
StarCraft II. In a 2009 interview, Lee relates that his return is
temporary and that he will retire again in three years. A job in a
trading company is lined up for him once he is done gaming
professionally (Yong-woo Kim). In a parallel career move, pro gamer Seo
Jihoon found a position as a sports marketer with the Korean
conglomerate CJ Group once he retired from StarCraft. A book published
in 2000 in the wake of the financial crisis called Starcnomics connects
StarCraft and its game play mechanics to the business world (Tae-heung
Kim; Hee-jong Kang). [The parallel between the logic of gaming and
business may be evidenced in the United States]{.underline} as well.
[The University of Florida has offered a class on "21st Century Skills
in StarCraft," while the University of California, Berkeley campus has
competitive StarCraft courses. Playing StarCraft teaches one to become
better at life within capitalism.]{.underline}

These examples illustrate that [StarCraft is]{.underline} **[not merely
a form of play;]{.underline}** instead, [much of the "play" within the
game could be considered a form of work]{.underline}. Unlike many video
games, the player does not control an avatar or an in-game virtual
representative (usually the main character of a narrative). In StarCraft
and many RTS games, [the player assumes a **godlike
overseer**]{.underline}/ manager position [with an isometric view of the
battlefield]{.underline}. At the start of a session, the player can see
and control his or her base, [with the rest of the map, in the
bottom-left corner of the screen, obscured by a]{.underline} **["fog of
war."]{.underline}** If the player clicks on parts of the map past his
or her base, the view is hidden in blackness until it is traversed by
one of the player's military units. The player knows only two things:
how large the map is and that an enemy is located somewhere. [As
in]{.underline} **[cognitive mapping]{.underline}**, [the player wishes
to lift the fog of war to chart out the playing area and]{.underline}
**[master the space]{.underline}**. The player does not engage the enemy
immediately, for he or she must first build up forces in preparation for
it. And [in order to prepare, the player must acquire and manage
resources, like the capitalist in life outside the game.]{.underline}

Thus despite its twenty-fifth-century settings, [game play in StarCraft
proceeds with twentieth-century]{.underline} **[late capitalistic
assumptions]{.underline}**. At the start of each game, the player is
given a central base, four worker units, and start-up capital. With
these resources, the player constructs more buildings such as barracks,
factories, gateways, and spawning pools in order to recruit more
workers, build new structures, and produce new military units. The
worker units acquire vespene gas (a resource only found in the game)
from geysers and harvest minerals from the environment. The barracks
train an array of offensive and defensive military units, each with
particular modes of movement and attack patterns. Oftentimes preparation
for battle---and the battle itself---can take only minutes or an hour
and more, and the player is forced to make most of these crucial moments
by planning ahead, making quick decisions, and moving rapidly. The
thrill of engaging the enemy must be preceded by this tedious labor,
which is squandered when the player's units are destroyed in combat. As
such, [the aim of producing only in order to]{.underline} **[destroy and
be destroyed]{.underline}** [aligns]{.underline} StarCraft with
[something akin to]{.underline} **[building a sand
castle]{.underline}**. **[The pleasure of constructing a sand castle is
embodied in the labor utilized to build something
ephemeral]{.underline}**. [Within capitalism, this ephemerality is
obscured by the ideological belief that tedious labor is productive
labor]{.underline}, yet [management within StarCraft brings the basic
ephemerality of capital itself to the fore]{.underline}.

In Gamer Theory, McKenzie Wark breaks down the distinction between the
real world and the illusory world of the video game. He coins the term
"gamespace" to signify not the virtual realm depicted on a screen, but a
physically placeless realm where the logic of gaming, including
quantitative modes of human valuation such as the "lifebar," indicated
underneath each unit, underpins lived existence. In contrast to Johan
Huizinga's famous definition of play as "a stepping out of 'real' life
into a temporary sphere of activity with a disposition all of its own,"
for Wark [playing video games is coextensive with the human operation of
hardware and software in our contemporary postFordist
economy]{.underline} (26). "**[Games]{.underline}** are not
representations of this world," Wark writes, "they **[are]{.underline}**
more like **[allegories of a world made over as gamespace. They encode
the abstract principles upon which decisions about the realness of this
or that world are now decided]{.underline}**" (20).
[Considered]{.underline} **[within the logic of late
capitalism]{.underline}**, [gamespace quickly takes on a holistic
aspect, for it also describes the total administration of human activity
outside the video game, while perpetuating the ideology that the game is
nevertheless predicated on the "fair fight" and the maintenance of a
"level playing field."]{.underline} Gamespace **[overlaps with the space
of the neoliberal, global economy]{.underline}**. For Wark, a critical
theory of video games begins by [taking **outside reality** not as the
model to which games should aspire, but itself **as** "**a gamespace
that appears as an imperfect form of the computer game**"]{.underline}
(22).

As Wark dismantles the binary between reality and game, other
distinctions are implicated. Specifically, if [gamespace describes
an]{.underline} **[existential condition]{.underline}** [in late
capitalism]{.underline}, and if the mechanics of reward and punishment
operative in video games allegorizes an identical mechanics in
contemporary lived life, then Wark's deconstruction necessarily [carries
similar implications for the distinction between work and
play.]{.underline} While in an earlier era of capitalist development
such a distinction structured [what Marx called]{.underline}
**["species-being,"]{.underline}** [as well as productive and
unproductive activity]{.underline}, in the age of video games work
becomes another form of play, and vice versa. [Gaming is a form of work,
but as of yet not everyone is paid to play]{.underline}.

The [rules of fair play in video games and the ideology of
neoliberalism]{.underline} **[intersect]{.underline}**: [if the player
works hard, the player's efforts will be acknowledged and the work
compensated]{.underline}. Most video games are motivated by this reward
dynamic through the [achievement of a high score]{.underline} or the
acquisition of coveted items and money, both of which [correspond to the
acquisition of capital in the nonvirtual space]{.underline}. Endless
acquisition in gamespace is particularly pronounced in the practice of
"gold farming," widespread in China. Gold farmers play for hours
acquiring virtual capital in MMORPG games such as World of Warcraft in
order to sell it for real capital (Vincent). Yet through this,
**[traditional ontological distinctions]{.underline}** [between gaming
and the actual world are radically confused]{.underline}. Approaching
online RPGs as an economist, Edward Castronova describes the relatively
[banal "economics of fun"]{.underline} that [underpin the synthetic
world of games. "**The economy is in fact an integral part of the
fantasy**,"]{.underline} Castronova writes. "**[Nothing makes a world
feel more alive than an active market system]{.underline}**" (172). Gold
farming, the most laborious form of [contemporary video gaming in the
neoliberal economy]{.underline}, **[troubles Western capitalist
notions]{.underline}** [of work and play by bringing tedium into
play]{.underline}. It is thus perhaps not a surprise that certain
journalists express disdain for professional video gaming and with the
idea of eSports: for them, video games belong to the realm of leisure,
sitting for hours being unproductive, and are not supposed to be
laborious.

Yet in this, StarCraft offers peculiar problems. StarCraft provides
abundant financial reward, especially for professional gamers, who are
among the highest paid in Korean eSports, but its game play does not
depend on conventional systems of reward. In-game capital provides
player satisfaction in most games. However in StarCraft, since in-game
capital is ephemeral, the player has only his or her professional
record. This is contrary to other games where gamers have something "to
show," such as a powerful avatar with the capital, commodities, and
experience to signify the labor and time put into the game. In StarCraft
the only record of total labor time is the players' IDs with their
career wins and losses. The point of StarCraft is not to accumulate
resources, but to use them as efficiently as possible before the match
is over. In-game resources such as minerals and vespene gas imitate the
exchange value of money in order to produce more buildings and units,
but there is no long-term merit to the production of surplus value
beyond the length of the individual match. Unlike in gold farming,
accumulated capital retains no exchange value. Instead, resources have
use value insofar as they become mobilized to defeat the enemy. Seen
from the perspective of gamespace, [the conditions of the professional
StarCraft player imitate those of temporary capitalist labor, but the
player's activity also reveals the]{.underline} **[virtual
ontology]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[short-term orientation of
capital itself]{.underline}**. The management of minerals and vespene
gas in many ways allegorizes the management of virtual funds for
short-term, liquid markets in the shadow banking system.

If games create environments where gamers, regardless of their identity,
compete in "fair play," then extreme gamers push its limits by playing
harder than everyone else. The [morbid fascination in gamers who play
themselves to death then threatens to expose an older ideological
assumption that underpins this very interest: that human activity may be
divided cleanly between unproductive leisure and productive
labor]{.underline}. Despite the claim that postindustrial economies have
unilaterally dissolved the boundary between leisure and labor, **[within
techno-Orientalism]{.underline}** [this ideological remnant of the
industrial economy reinscribes the division]{.underline}. **[Asian gamer
death then remains ambivalent]{.underline}**, [for it]{.underline}
**[blurs the discursive boundaries]{.underline}** [that underpin the
gamespace of contemporary capitalism while]{.underline} **[taking the
logic of life in neoliberalism to its limit]{.underline}**. [The
threatened subject of the neoliberal economy must subsequently
underscore the real historical specificities that persist between
cultures and reconstitute them on the level of ontology]{.underline}.
The Western gamer then, like that depicted in Sony's commercial,
believes that he or she can stay on top without having to compete with
the rising Asian economies. [Such differences are all too often
understood within the tropes of racism and technology:]{.underline}
**[Asians are chained to their computers]{.underline}** through their
addiction to StarCraft, **[while the West remains]{.underline}**
essentially **[free]{.underline}**, having a much more "healthy"
relationship to video games. However, our analysis of gaming and capital
suggests that [all users are implicated in the logic of
gamespace]{.underline}.

[The dream of "never stop playing," like the mystifications of
Orientalism, reflects not the truth of the exotic Other]{.underline}, or
the transgressive possibilities opened up by purchasing a PlayStation
Vita, [but the]{.underline} **[narcissism of the capitalist
subject]{.underline}**. [The dream of gaming endlessly reflects the
dream of the hip gamer who never has to work, while the Asian gamer, who
dies from playing, points to a]{.underline} **[fundamental
aporia]{.underline}** [that subtends the binary between]{.underline}
work and play, and between **[self and exotic other]{.underline}**. As
Alexander R. Galloway puts it in his book The Interface Effect, "We are
all gold farmers" (136). [This thought]{.underline} **[troubles binaries
of life]{.underline}** [in industrial capitalism by which we understand
value and productivity in modernity]{.underline}. In this, the Asian
gamer may be thought of as "ahead" of the West in terms of the
development of the neoliberal economy. [Reinstating racial binaries
functions as a bulwark against the deconstruction of life (which should
be productive in capitalism) and death (which is often considered
unproductive), as well as against the anxiety this deconstruction
produces.]{.underline} **[Fetishizing Asian gamer death]{.underline}**
[and the Asian work ethic performs the]{.underline} **[work of
disavowal]{.underline}**, disavowal [of the fundamental differences that
persist between self and other, while attempting to mediate non-Western
modes of capitalist productivity]{.underline}.

When Blizzard released StarCraft II in 2010, eAthletes immediately
embraced the new installment. Professional leagues sprouted up, and in
May 2012 both OnGameNet (the most prestigious StarCraft league) and the
Korean eSports Association announced that they would be making the
official transition to StarCraft II (TeamLiquid). Lim Yo-hwan, the
player most synonymous with StarCraft, also retired from StarCraft:
Brood War to begin playing StarCraft II, a move so significant that a
documentary titled Lim Yo-hwan's Wings was produced (Ho-kyung Choi). The
industry was able to migrate quickly because of the similarity of the
mechanics between StarCraft and StarCraft II. And thus like its
predecessor, [StarCraft II may be read to problematize the binary
between work and play outside the game, as well as imaginations of
Occident and Orient]{.underline}. It also makes apparent the quick turns
in the cutthroat Internet gaming milieu that characterizes much of East
Asia [and brings to the fore the culmination of capitalist
logic]{.underline}. This is the very same mechanism that cycles
eAthletes, while leaving young men, and the occasional young woman, dead
in PC bangs just as quickly as it promotes them to national heroes.
While these gamers perish in their quest to never stop playing, [the
death of the Asian gamer will be appropriated within the geopolitics of
labor in Asia]{.underline}---unless, of course, video gaming is allowed
to transcend reified notions of play.

## Case

### Impact\-\--TL

#### Warfare is the [newest mode]{.underline} of Anti-Asian violence. From the [Chinese Exclusion Act]{.underline} and the [Transcontinental Railroad]{.underline} to [Asian prostitution]{.underline} in the US military and [national and economic security]{.underline}, the [Asiatic Danger]{.underline} has been a threat [perpetuated across time]{.underline}. It's time to expand the scope of understanding to see the [intersectional violence]{.underline} between Asians and other people of color as the [stepping stool]{.underline} of white supremacy.

In the late 19th century, white [Americans]{.underline} faced the
prospect that Chinese and other Asians might become a significant
portion of the population of the United States. In response, they
[passed a series of laws excluding Chinese people from immigration and
citizenship.]{.underline}

The [justification for exclusion was that the Chinese were]{.underline}
an **["unassimilable"]{.underline}** race [and therefore
could]{.underline} **[never become Americans]{.underline}**.
[Exclusion]{.underline} soon [extended to]{.underline} **[all
Asians]{.underline}** and remained in U.S. law until 1952. [Its
rationale---that]{.underline} [**Asians pose a racial danger to American
society**---has endured in our politics and culture to this
day]{.underline}.

Imagine, for a moment, that there had been no exclusion laws, and
Chinese and other Asians had continued to freely immigrate to the United
States. California, the West, indeed, the whole country would look
radically different today. Not all of Asia's "teeming masses" would have
inundated the U.S.; migration does not work that way. The poorest do not
migrate, because they can't afford to, and the wealthiest don't need to.
[Migration sets patterns]{.underline}, or chains, [from certain areas
and not others]{.underline}. Still, by 1950, many millions of Asian
Americans would have been building their lives in the United States,
and, in the process, contributing to the country. Instead, that year
[there were a mere 320,000 Asian Americans, composing just two-tenths of
1 percent of the U.S. population]{.underline}. Since the immigration
reforms of 1965, the number of Asian Americans has increased, but [we
are still barely]{.underline} **[6 percent]{.underline}** [of the U.S.
population]{.underline}. [Yet]{.underline} too many [Americans still
believe that there are]{.underline} **[too many Asians]{.underline}**
[in the U.S. and that]{.underline} **[we don't belong
here]{.underline}**.

[For many Asian Americans, the policy of exclusion looms as large as Jim
Crow]{.underline} does for Black people. [The association
is]{.underline} **[more than a metaphor]{.underline}**. In the late 19th
century, **[Jim Crow and Chinese exclusion were related
projects]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[white
supremacy]{.underline}**, [one in the South and one in the
West]{.underline}. After the Civil War, the old planter class and the
new industrialists in the South responded to the prospect of equality
for the formerly enslaved by relegating them to second-class status,
stripped of the franchise and other civil rights. [The dangers that
white supremacists associated with Black citizenship provided an object
lesson for why Chinese people should be excluded. A]{.underline}
**[reactionary political alliance]{.underline}** [of the West and the
South pushed]{.underline} the [exclusion]{.underline} laws through
Congress.

**[Asiatic exclusion]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Jim Crow
segregation]{.underline}** [were two modes of]{.underline} **[racial
management]{.underline}** [necessary for white supremacy]{.underline}
after the Civil War, [when the West and the South were being integrated
into a national economy based on corporate capital and a polity made up
of white male voters]{.underline}. [These policies relied
on]{.underline} **[euphemisms]{.underline}** and legal
fictions**[---"aliens ineligible to citizenship"]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **["separate but equal"]{.underline}**---to work
around the Fourteenth Amendment's promise of equal protection and due
process for all. Indeed, in the late 19th century, [the Supreme Court
would interpret the Fourteenth Amendment to favor the rights of capital,
and not those of formerly enslaved people or Asian
immigrants]{.underline}.

Laws like these were not preordained, but resulted from a choice made
between two competing visions: The nation could be built on the
principle of white supremacy or on that of democracy. Frederick Douglass
understood that the futures of the South and the West were entwined, and
that together, they would determine the fate of the nation as a whole.
"I want a home here not only for the Negro, the mulatto, and the Latin
races," he said in 1869, speaking out against Chinese exclusion, "but I
want the Asiatic to find a home here in the United States, and feel at
home here, both for his sake and for ours."

[Americans]{.underline} today [are]{.underline} **[slowly
beginning]{.underline}** [to appreciate the nature of systemic racism
against Black people]{.underline}. **[We need to expand the scope of our
understanding;]{.underline}** [different historical dynamics have
produced different racisms]{.underline}. But although distinct,
[their]{.underline} **[histories are connected]{.underline}** [and
their]{.underline} **[legacies overlap]{.underline}**, sometimes
**[chaotically]{.underline}**. And [if we don't understand the history
of exclusion, we cannot understand the racist hatred that continues to
be directed against Asian Americans in the present]{.underline}.

Chinese people first came to the United States in large numbers during
the California Gold Rush of 1848 and '49, which crowned the continental
expansion of the U.S. [Under the sign of]{.underline} **["manifest
destiny"]{.underline}**---the idea that the West was God's gift to white
Protestant Americans---the United States had gone to war with Mexico and
annexed its northern half, including California. [Westward expansion
absorbed the sectional conflict over slavery and brought the genocide of
Indigenous peoples across the Great Plains and the West]{.underline}.

The idea of manifest destiny might seem quaint to our ears today, but
its [core imperative of a]{.underline} **[white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant
nation]{.underline}** [continued to define the dominant vision of the
United States for a century]{.underline}. When [Euro-American
settlers]{.underline} arrived at the edge of the continent, they
[celebrated their conquest of the West and their closing of the
frontier. From there, they looked out **across the Pacific** Ocean---the
next frontier---with both excitement at the prospect of new conquests
and anxiety over the new peoples that might come.]{.underline}

The Gold Rush is often celebrated for the individual daring, ingenuity,
and male camaraderie of the 49ers, engaged in a bold experiment in
democratic self-government. Less well remembered, but no less true, is
that it was also violent and racist. Gold seekers and the fledgling
state government of California pursued the extermination of Indigenous
peoples. White, native-born Americans agitated against foreign miners,
weaponizing manifest destiny for competitive gain, and driving many
European, Australian, Chilean, Sonoran, and Chinese miners from the
diggings.

[Hostility against the Chinese took on a special cast in
1852]{.underline}. California Governor John Bigler, facing a tight race
for reelection, made an incendiary speech before the state legislature,
[claiming that the Chinese]{.underline}, **[a race of heathens and
slaves]{.underline}**, [were]{.underline} **[invading the
state]{.underline}** [and threatening its society of free
producers]{.underline}. Leaflets printed by Bigler and newspaper
accounts circulated copies of the speech around the state. Many miners
were already anxious, because the easy gold in the rivers was being
depleted and deep-pocketed capitalists were taking over the industry,
replacing independent prospecting with wage labor in underground quartz
mines. Bigler's bigotry found a receptive audience. [White miners passed
resolutions to keep Chinese people out of their districts]{.underline}
and provided the votes Bigler needed to win a second term. He operated
from [the classic nativist playbook: Tap into popular grievances, offer
a theory that blames an outsider group, and **weaponize resentment** for
partisan gain]{.underline}.

Chinese people in California were voluntary emigrants and independent
prospectors, not indentured workers. Bigler claimed that "coolies ...
are being sent here under contract ... at merely nominal wages ...
\[and\] their families have been retained as hostages for the faithful
performance of the contracts." His argument that these were not bona
fide contracts but were rooted in "moral turpitude" and coercion invoked
two contemporary anxieties. One was the use, mainly by the British, of
Indian indentured labor in the Caribbean plantation colonies after the
abolition of slavery. The other was the more proximate example of
slavery in the American South. These [two associations---**colonialism
and slavery**---inspired the racist theories against Chinese immigrants,
and have haunted Chinese Americans ever since]{.underline}.

Two Chinese American merchant leaders in San Francisco, Tong K. Achick
and Hab Wa, wrote a letter to Bigler, refuting his claims. They
explained that the Chinese in California included laborers,
tradespeople, mechanics, gentry, and teachers; "none are 'Coolies' if by
that word you mean bound men or contract slaves." They added, "In the
important matters we are good men; we honor our parents; we take care of
our children; we are industrious and peaceable; we trade much; we are
trusted for small and large sums; we pay our debts and are honest; and
of course we tell the truth." Finally, Tong and Hab asserted that there
was a positive relationship between migration and trade, that they were
mutually supporting elements of foreign contact and exchange. "If you
want to check immigration from Asia," they argued, "you will have to do
it by checking Asiatic commerce."

A resurgence of racism against the Chinese engulfed San Francisco in the
1870s, including **[mob violence]{.underline}**,
**[arson]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[discriminatory municipal
ordinances]{.underline}**. This hatred [emerged after completion of
the]{.underline} **[transcontinental railroad]{.underline}**, [which
brought unforeseen consequences to the West]{.underline}. California's
new connection to the East Coast encouraged domestic migration and the
importation of cheap manufactured goods, resulting in falling wages and
unemployment. Integration into the national market brought the long tail
of economic recession from the East. [The]{.underline} **["coolie"
trope]{.underline}** [was remarkably adaptive to new
conditions]{.underline}. The philosopher Henry George gave it
theoretical heft, using what was then referred to as the "Chinese
question" to test his emerging views about labor and monopoly. He argued
that, [unlike European immigrants, whose wages eventually rose to the
level of native-born workers, Chinese immigrants were a permanent source
of cheap labor because they were unassimilable coolies]{.underline}.
George imagined [a class struggle between workers and capitalists, with
the Chinese in the camp of the bosses]{.underline}.

Anti-coolieism also targeted Chinese women. There weren't many Chinese
immigrant women in California, but some were wives of merchants and
workers, or wives of fishermen who worked alongside their husbands as
partners, while others were servants of wealthy Chinese. They also
included sex workers who offered services to both Chinese and white men,
but [the anti-Chinese movement stereotyped all Chinese women as
prostitutes, dubbing them **"slave girls,"**]{.underline} female
counterparts to male coolie laborers. These attacks [portrayed them
as]{.underline} **[diseased and immoral]{.underline}**, [but that
rhetoric was also laced with **exoticism and desire**]{.underline}. San
Francisco's most famous madam, Ah Toy, was said to be so beautiful that
men paid an ounce of gold just to look at her.

The [Page Act of 1875]{.underline}, the first Chinese-exclusion law in
the U.S., [barred "Mongolian prostitutes" from entering the
country]{.underline}. The law [required all women to be interrogated
upon entry to prove they were not a prostitute]{.underline};
unsurprisingly, Chinese female immigration plummeted. [That satisfied
the]{.underline} **[real motive]{.underline}** behind the Page Act, [the
prevention of Chinese population growth through natural reproduction.
The legislation left a]{.underline} **[legacy of separated
families]{.underline}**, [and helped establish the enduring stereotype
of]{.underline} **["Oriental"]{.underline}** [women as]{.underline}
**[dangerous and desirable]{.underline}**.

The Page Act also barred foreign contract laborers, but it could not
keep out Chinese men, because they were not indentured. The Chinese
Exclusion Act of 1882 took care of that---barring Chinese laborers from
entering the United States, and all Chinese immigrants from naturalized
citizenship. The [exclusion laws codified the idea that the Chinese were
racially unassimilable. They could never be anything but a coolie race,
controlled by despotic masters, without individual personality or will,
in no way independent in thought or action]{.underline}. The U.S.
Supreme Court layered another theory onto coolieism: that **[Chinese
exclusion was necessary for national security]{.underline}**. In Chae
Chan Ping v. U.S. in 1889, **[the Court wrote]{.underline}**,

> [To preserve its independence, and]{.underline} **[give
> security]{.underline}** [against foreign aggression and encroachment,
> is the highest duty of every nation]{.underline} ... If, therefore,
> [the]{.underline} **[government of the United States]{.underline}**
> ... **[considers the presence of foreigners]{.underline}** [of a
> different race in this country, who will not assimilate with us, to
> be]{.underline} **[dangerous to its peace and security]{.underline}**,
> their exclusion is not to be stayed because at the time there are no
> actual hostilities with the nation of which the foreigners are
> subjects. [The]{.underline} **[existence of war]{.underline}** [would
> render the necessity of the proceeding only more obvious and
> pressing]{.underline}.

Previously, federal regulation of immigration had been justified under
the commerce clause of the Constitution. In upholding Chinese exclusion,
the Court **[invoked national security]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[justify racist legislation]{.underline}**. But in the 1880s, [it was
not the Chinese but the racism they faced that had proved dangerous to
peace and security, bringing worsening violence against Chinese
communities]{.underline}. In 1885 alone, [the entire Chinese population
of Tacoma, Washington, was **violently expelled**, and 128 Chinese coal
miners from Rock Springs, Wyoming, were **massacred**]{.underline}.

The [Chinese-exclusion laws were subsequently]{.underline}
**[extended]{.underline}** [to people from the]{.underline}
**[Philippines]{.underline}**, **[India]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[Japan]{.underline}** (indeed, [an entire "barred
Asiatic zone" was established in 1917]{.underline}), **[lumping
different national-origin groups]{.underline}** [into a single racial
category,]{.underline} **[the "Asiatic."]{.underline}**

**[Modern colonialism]{.underline}** [and global trade meant a greater
integration of]{.underline} the global economy and, with it, [mass
migration, sparking struggles over race and immigration policy
throughout the Anglophone world]{.underline}. As Tong and Hab, the
Chinese merchants, pointed out in 1852, trade begets migration, and vice
versa. Thus American policy makers constructed an "open door" to China
that would swing one way, allowing American products, missionaries, and
capital to enter China while keeping Chinese people out of the United
States. **[For all its talk about]{.underline}** the
**[equality]{.underline}** of nations and the open door, [the American
approach was]{.underline} typically **[colonial]{.underline}**,
[treating China as an **object of commercial and missionary
desire**]{.underline} [but Chinese people as]{.underline} **[degraded
and backward]{.underline}**, [undesirable as immigrants]{.underline}.

The **[settler colonies]{.underline}** [of the British empire followed
the example of the United States]{.underline}. Canada mimicked America's
Chinese-exclusion law; Australia adopted an unapologetic "White
Australia" policy in 1901. South Africa took inspiration from Jim Crow
in the U.S. and from White Australia. In the early 20th century,
[American and British racists were publishing screeds such
as]{.underline} "The Passing of the Great Race," [**"The Asiatic Danger
in the Colonies,"** and]{.underline} **["The Rising Tide of
Color"]{.underline}** to promote the idea that the temperate zones of
the world should be reserved for the white race.

But not only white supremacists connected domestic and foreign policies.
Anti-racists and anti-imperialists also found common cause and
solidarities across the global color lines. The antislavery book Uncle
Tom's Cabin was a best seller in 1901, when it became the first American
novel to be translated into Chinese. "The book is not really about the
sufferings of the black race as it is about all races under the whites,"
a book reviewer in Shanghai wrote. "The novel is a wake-up call to rouse
us from a deep dream."

**[Racisms]{.underline}**, while originating in specific contexts,
**[must be continually reproduced]{.underline}** [in order to remain
potent]{.underline}, as the late Afro-British sociologist Stuart Hall
and other cultural theorists have emphasized. [Because the exclusion
laws could not eliminate all Asians from the United States]{.underline}
(though that was the intention of violent "driving out" campaigns), [the
western states erected a]{.underline} **[legal edifice]{.underline}**
[to ensure their subordination and marginalization]{.underline}. [Racist
laws forbade Asians from marrying white people, attending white schools,
testifying in court against white people, owning agricultural property,
and holding commercial and professional licenses]{.underline}.
Restrictive covenants barred the sale of real estate to "Negroes, Jews
and Orientals." [Exclusion underwrote the popular understanding that
Asian Americans born in the United States were]{.underline} **[not true
citizens]{.underline}**, despite their birthright. The presumption of
foreign loyalties most famously led to the incarceration of [Japanese
Americans during World War II]{.underline} on grounds that they [were an
**"enemy race."**]{.underline}

Most racist laws against Asians remained in force until the late 1940s,
when Black civil-rights activism defeated similar restrictions on
African Americans. The Asiatic-exclusion laws themselves fell from 1943
to 1952, the result of wartime foreign-policy imperatives. When Congress
repealed the laws, however, it imposed minuscule annual quotas on Asian
countries. Nevertheless, immigration opened a bit, and Asian Americans
made small steps in socioeconomic and residential mobility, gaining
access to professions and suburbs.

During the Cold War, an [ideological space]{.underline} emerged in which
Asian Americans could declare opposition to communism in East Asia as a
way to assert their loyalty to the United States, as the historian Ellen
Wu writes in her book The Color of Success. They also [cannily
promoted]{.underline} **[stereotyped cultural
qualities]{.underline}**---[that Asian Americans are]{.underline}
**[quiet, good workers, good students, and respectful of their
parents]{.underline}**---to advocate for their social inclusion.
[Journalists and sociologists **weaponized** these ideas to discipline
Black and Latino people]{.underline}, and some Asian Americans believed
they were better, too. [Through these complex dynamics]{.underline}, Wu
argues, **[Asian Americans' place on the racial landscape went from
being "definitively not white" to "definitively not
Black."]{.underline}**

But repeal of the exclusion laws, incremental socioeconomic mobility,
and even the establishment of equal quotas in the 1965 immigration law
were insufficient to eradicate racism against Asian Americans. That is,
in part, because of the weight of history. But it's also because [racism
found ample grounds for reproduction in the conduct of]{.underline}
**[American colonialism and wars]{.underline}** [in the Asia-Pacific
region]{.underline}, from the Opium Wars and gunboat diplomacy in the
19th century straight through the conflicts of the 20th century.

[Although all wars entail the dehumanization of the enemy,
the]{.underline} **[dehumanization of Asians is
distinctive]{.underline}** [in its racial idiom and its persistence
across time]{.underline}. [It centers around the ideas that, for Asians,
"life is cheap" and that, as uncivilized peoples, they do not engage in
"civilized" warfare and therefore must be fought with like
means]{.underline}. During the Philippine-American War, which ran from
1899 to 1902, [the United States invented **waterboarding** to torture
Filipino guerrilla fighters]{.underline}. [The U.S. Army also burned
villages and rounded up civilians into strategic hamlets, a practice it
would later use in Vietnam]{.underline}. The United States dropped
**[atomic bombs]{.underline}** [on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and **napalm**
and **Agent Orange** on Vietnam]{.underline}. In truth, it was the U.S.
military that considered Asian life cheap and engaged in barbaric
warfare against Asian people.

The **[prostitution of Asian women]{.underline}** [for American
servicemen is an enduring feature of the]{.underline} **[U.S. military
experience]{.underline}** in Asia. [Sex markets have ringed U.S. Army
and Navy bases, whether during wartime or Cold War occupation, in
Vietnam, Korea, the Philippines, Okinawa, and Guam]{.underline}. The
long history of military prostitution generated racist and misogynist
stereotypes, in which [Asian women were portrayed as]{.underline}
**[exotic, subservient, and always available]{.underline}**. As the
Korean American author Marie Myong-Ok Lee writes, the ["cultural
attitudes and stereotypes about Asian women don't end when a soldier
returns home. They become]{.underline} **[incorporated into American
culture]{.underline}** ... Just ask yourself, are these phrases
familiar? 'Me so horny.' 'Me love you long time.'["]{.underline}

Finally, [to the hot and cold wars we must add the **trade
wars**]{.underline}. In the 1980s, the introduction of Japanese
**[electronics]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[automobiles]{.underline}** into the U.S. market [sparked a racially
tinged protectionist movement]{.underline}. In the early 21st century,
[Americans' anxiety about]{.underline} **[China's rise]{.underline}**
[as a global economic power has fueled a]{.underline} **[new round of
"Yellow Peril" racism]{.underline}**. **[The figure of the coolie has
returned]{.underline}**, [embodied in factory assembly
workers]{.underline} in China's special economic zones **[and
Chinese]{.underline}** international and Chinese American university
**[students in the United States]{.underline}**. They are [imagined to
toil under slave-like conditions]{.underline} ([ruled by the Communist
Party or by tiger moms]{.underline}), their extreme labor posing unfair
competition against white American workers and students. [The stereotype
of the]{.underline} **[high-achieving model minority]{.underline}**,
[aside from obscuring major differences in socioeconomic status among
different Asian groups]{.underline}, **[is a pathology, not a
compliment]{.underline}**.

Hall, the sociologist, famously wrote that we ought to understand "not
racism in general but racisms." According to Hall, racism might be
everywhere a "deeply anti-human and anti-social practice," but it is not
"everywhere the same." Specific histories, contexts, and environments
produce particular racisms, he said. Hall understood, too, that there's
no such thing as "race" in a biological sense. Rather, racism is a way
of thinking about social groups according to differences that are
presumed to be natural and immutable.

Racism is more than a series of stereotypes. It is ideological---a way
of looking at the world that justifies and explains material structures
of inequality and frames, if not determines, the life chances of
racialized groups[. In the United States, there's much to unpack to
understand the racisms that are shot through our history and our
present, and how each strand of experience is unique as well as related
to that of others]{.underline}. In the American context, [racisms uphold
the logics and practices of white supremacy]{.underline}.

The Indigenous critic Jodi Byrd offers a useful approach that
distinguishes between Native peoples, European settlers, and later
"arrivants," the latter a diverse category including enslaved people and
immigrant workers. Byrd counsels us to recognize distinct racial
formations, to acknowledge their respective historical weights and
legacies, while resisting the impulse to create hierarchies or analogies
of oppression.

[In the aftermath of the]{.underline} **[recent murder of eight people
in Atlanta]{.underline}**, [including six Korean and Chinese
women]{.underline}---Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, Yong
Ae Yue, Xiaojie Tan, and Daoyou Feng---[which took place on top of a
year of pandemic-related harassment and assaults against Asian
Americans]{.underline}, [I've been thinking about this
country's]{.underline} **[deep ignorance of Asian American
communities]{.underline}**. Why does it seem so difficult for many
Americans to understand that [racism is part of our experience, past and
present]{.underline}? Some suggest that **[we remain invisible to
Americans]{.underline}**, perhaps because **[we're perceived as
quiet]{.underline}**. But in fact, [we've been speaking up]{.underline}
and speaking out for a long time[---it's just that]{.underline} **[few
people have been paying attention]{.underline}**.

[Americans are still struggling over competing ideas of what this nation
should be]{.underline}. Sadly, [that **debate** still includes whether
Asians belong, or whether racism against them even exists]{.underline}.
Although the white-supremacist vision of manifest destiny today animates
Trumpism, we still have another choice. Frederick Douglass's democratic
vision offers us a path toward a more inclusive future, should we decide
to stand in solidarity against all racisms.

### Thesis\-\--Bio-Orientalism

#### The crisis in the [imagined security]{.underline} of Western life produces the necessary threat of [Yellow Life]{.underline} which transcends [time]{.underline} and [being]{.underline}. Yellow Life is the [racialized disease]{.underline} that White society must become [immunized]{.underline} to, even as Yellow life [reproduces]{.underline}, [expands]{.underline}, [spreads]{.underline} and [spills]{.underline} past the [very cells]{.underline} of the Asian body.

In this article, I argue that a process of [orientalism constructs
"Yellow Life" as the antinomy and horizon of possibility for Western
"life" as an unmarked category representing the white possessive
individual as a distinct form of life]{.underline}. This process I term
bio-orientalism for its emphasis on tropes and [images of biological
life]{.underline} to [mark Yellow Life as forms of nonhuman life
threatening to perpetually engulf, invade, and corrupt the
West]{.underline}. Bio-orientalism has its origins in nineteenth-century
Yellow Peril discourse, yet reappears [whenever there is a]{.underline}
**[crisis in the imagined security of Western life]{.underline}** [that
must conjure the threat of Yellow Life as a causal agent of
blame]{.underline} [obscuring Western life's]{.underline} own suicidal
[addiction to **global white supremacy** and **racial
capitalism**]{.underline}. [Bio-orientalism marks]{.underline}
**[moments of crisis]{.underline}** [in the formation of Western
life]{.underline}, from the twentieth-century rise of Japan, through the
mid-century "loss of China" and rupture of decolonizations, to the
contemporary resurgence of China threatening America's superpower and
civilizational status (Kim 2004; Prashad 2008). [For over a century,
Western countries conjured Asia as both the **premodern** that the West
has decisively put behind it and the **threatening future** of an Asia
that overwhelms and renders extinct Western life as we have come to know
it.]{.underline} Climate-impacted crises like the COVID-19 pandemic
increase the stakes and scope of bio-orientalist representations of Asia
that create material consequences for Asian Americans and Asian
populations globally.

[Bio-orientalism plays a key role in the]{.underline} **[replication of
anti-Asian racism]{.underline}** [over time]{.underline} and therefore
calls attention to Asian American political efforts to deconstruct and
fight orientalist stereotypes. While Asian American politics often
responds to bio-orientalism by seeking inclusion in the unmarked life of
white possessive individualism, I speculate upon an Asian Americanist
response that abandons the Human for a diversity of ways of living (and
life) otherwise (Lowe 1996; Okihiro 2014). My argument then contributes
to putting Asian American studies in conversation with developments in
the humanities and STS, particularly in understanding the mutual
processes of defining and racializing what counts as life itself
(Cardozo and Subramaniam 2013; Lee 2014; Huang 2017; Tran 2018). To make
this argument, in this article I first define
[bio-orientalism]{.underline} through an attention to what [makes it
different from orientalisms that highlight Asia as a **technological
threat to the future**]{.underline} and show how in early Yellow Peril
literature images of biological threat predominate. I then turn to Bryan
Thao Worra's poetry collection Demonstra to highlight a different
archive in the history of bio-orientalism and how Worra diagnoses
bio-orientalism as the potential for embracing Yellow Life as life lived
otherwise (Chuh 2003). Particularly, in contrast to Donna Haraway's
famous figure of the cyborg, I focus on Worra's figure of
the Zombuddha that plays with recent turns to depicting the zombie as a
particularly Asian threat, revealing the Zombuddha as a unique
entanglement of Caribbean history, Western horror, and Laotian cosmology
that begins to map other ways of embracing the otherness of Yellow Life.

Defining Bio-orientalism

Arguing that bio-orientalism produces a distinction between Yellow Life
and unmarked life already shows that **["life"]{.underline}**
[itself]{.underline} **[never exists prior to
racialization]{.underline}** (Lee 2014; Weheliye 2014; Jackson 2015).
Often [unmarked life or the Human refers to the white liberal subject
and the form of life they
embody]{.underline}.[1](https://catalystjournal.org/index.php/catalyst/article/download/34382/27577?inline=1#note1) Scientific
and popular [discourses take a very particular kind of situated
body---]{.underline}often of [**the white, male, able, Western
subject**---and treat it as the universal of subjectivity
itself]{.underline}. By "life" I also mean [the]{.underline} **[ontology
of life]{.underline}** [upon which such a subject is based]{.underline};
this [is life as bounded to bodies, singular and irreducible, and based
on a vision of nature as mechanical or inert and open to the active
agency of human action]{.underline} (Bennett 2010). C.B. Macpherson
(2010) calls this kind of life the possessive individual, whose
"possessive quality is found in its conception of the individual as
essentially the proprietor of his own person or capacities, owing
nothing to society for them" (3). The possessive individual owns himself
as property, and engages with other individuals to the degree that they
can also be recognized as property owners, something often denied to
racialized others. This is also [inherently the gendered male body of
the patriarch that imagines itself as both inviolable from outside
penetration and as one with his property, which can include women,
children, slaves, animals, and inanimate objects]{.underline} (Dubber
2005). **[White racial formation]{.underline}** [views the life of the
possessive individual as one carefully bounded and aloof from
the]{.underline} **[messiness of reality]{.underline}**, [while
also]{.underline} **[master of all other forms of life]{.underline}**
(Lipsitz 2006).

This life of the possessive individual fears constantly the violation of
his own boundaries through contagion and infection. Following Roberto
Esposito\'s (2008) work on biopolitics, the possessive individual seeks
immunity as "a temporary or definitive exemption on the part of the
subject with regard to concrete obligations or responsibilities that
under normal circumstances would bind one to others" (45). In
Esposito\'s reading, [community is the "obligation of reciprocal
donation"]{.underline} (50) [that threatens]{.underline} **["risky
contact" with otherness]{.underline}**, [so that]{.underline} **[the
immunized individual]{.underline}** [seeks to restore "its own borders
that were jeopardized by the common"]{.underline} (50). To speak of the
Human, as a white liberal subject, then is to speak of this immunized
possessive individual who sees his body as property, and seeks to
maintain it as such, while also refusing to live in a common world with
life that threatens his body as property. Through the process of
bio-orientalism, **[Yellow Life]{.underline}** [appears as what
threatens to overcome the]{.underline} **[immunized white
life]{.underline}** [and the form of life against which the possessive
individual comes into being]{.underline}. [A necessary
response]{.underline} to bio-orientalism therefore, I argue, [is to
dismantle the white possessive individual's immunized response to
otherness and risk exposure to other imagined forms of
life.]{.underline}

By emphasizing the ontology of liveliness, bio-orientalism responds to
transformations in anti-Asian racism that cannot be reduced to images of
Asia as the threat of technological non-life or inhuman labor.
Scholarship on Asiatic racial form argues that [the figure of the Asian
comes into being as a **misplaced**]{.underline} [but]{.underline}
**[concrete representation]{.underline}** [for the abstract violence of
capitalism]{.underline} (Lye 2004; Day 2016). By paying attention to
Asiatic racial form's relationship to capitalism, what often receives
the most attention are those [representations]{.underline} that [paint
the Asian body as a form of inhuman technology and labor.]{.underline}
Such representations [fit under the label of]{.underline}
**[techno-orientalism]{.underline}**, [which names "the phenomenon of
imagining Asia and Asians in hypo- or hypertechnological terms in
cultural productions and political discourse"]{.underline} (Roh et al.
2015, 2). [Techno-orientalism represents the]{.underline} **[linking of
Asiatic racial form with technology]{.underline}** [to produce
an]{.underline} **[inhuman non-life overcoming life
itself]{.underline}**, [understood properly as the biologically bounded
and autonomous white possessive individual]{.underline}. For STS,
techno-orientalism helps draw attention to the ways that [technology
does not just]{.underline} **[produce race]{.underline}**, [but is
itself already **thoroughly saturated**]{.underline} [by racial
categories and conceptions]{.underline} (Chun 2012; Benjamin 2019). Yet
by the very nature of its focus, the examples and cases
techno-orientalism highlights overwhelmingly favor the robotic and
mechanical, losing sight of life itself as the category under
contestation in anti-Asian
racism.[2](https://catalystjournal.org/index.php/catalyst/article/download/34382/27577?inline=1#note2)

Distinct from yet working in tandem with techno-orientalism, which
deploys technology to define the Asiatic inhuman, what I term
bio-orientalism relies on [biological and disease metaphors]{.underline}
to [characterize Asiatic racial form as nonhuman life]{.underline}, and
supplements research on Asiatic racial form by drawing attention to that
"bios" of life itself in biopolitics (Esposito 2008; Thacker 2011).
Rachel Lee\'s work on theorizing the biological in Asian American
studies provides a jumping off point for thinking through this bios of
bio-orientalism. Lee (2014) opens her book The Exquisite Corpse of Asian
America with the question of, when Asian American Studies orients itself
around discursive and economic determinants of racial formations, **[why
do "Asian American artists, authors, and performers keep scrutinizing
their body parts?"]{.underline}** (10). She answers the question by
dismissing Asian American studies' anxiety around the apparent
"stolidity of the biological" ([Lee]{.underline} 2014, 12) and instead
[focuses on the anxiety of "biological personhood not as fixed or
singular but as multiform and **distributed across time spans and
spatial ecologies**"]{.underline} (15). Lee's project, like other work
under the label of new materialism, seeks to recognize that [nature and
matter are not mechanical or inert, but instead lively and agentic
actors in their own right]{.underline} (Bennett 2010; Coole and Frost
2010; Shomura 2017). In recognizing the agency of matter, however, Lee
also brings attention to how [this matter is not socially blank but
already]{.underline} **[racialized]{.underline}**; **[even to speak of
genes or microbes already carries the specter of Asian
racialization]{.underline}**. She argues then that [contemporary racism
functions at scales greater and lesser than the individual body,
crafting]{.underline} **[immunized populations]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} what I call [the white possessive individual through
the **extraction** and **disposability** of racialized
others]{.underline}. This form of racism "depends upon the 'immune'
subject's mystified property---bounded self-possession---in his/herself
and in an array of planetary materials that in actuality remain,
biologically speaking, habitats for countless others" (Lee 2014, 223).
In disavowing his connection to lively matter, the white possessive
individual also expresses the fear of expropriation by, in Esposito\'s
(2008) terms, the munis, by what is both common and other to them.
Through bio-orientalism, I argue that [Yellow Life comes to stand in for
this threat to white immunity, even as to fully imagine the life of the
white possessive individual requires expropriation of Yellow
Life.]{.underline}

Rather than an attention to the biological being a novel intervention to
anti-Asian racism, bio-orientalism highlights how [the biological threat
of Yellow Life has been a longstanding]{.underline} **[hallmark of
racializing Asia]{.underline}** [as a threat to white life and white
futures.]{.underline} To modify the definition of techno-orientalism, I
view bio-orientalism as the phenomenon of [imagining Asia and Asians in
hypo- or hyperbiological terms in cultural productions and political
discourse]{.underline}. In bio-orientalism Asiatic racial form appears
as a particular form of life that questions the contours of the
possessive individual conception of life itself. **[Yellow Life seems to
always be reproducing itself, expanding, growing]{.underline}**---in
short, **[spreading beyond and spilling over]{.underline}** [what should
be the proper boundaries of a life form]{.underline}. As in other forms
of orientalism, there is the representation of Asians as a
group-collective that denies the possibility of individuation, but here
[bio-orientalism imagines]{.underline} that [collective through vitalist
terms, as an aggregate or multiplicity of the barely differentiated
whose singular undecidability appears through its constant
transformations]{.underline}. In contrast to the problem often tackled
within new materialism and STS of recognizing the creative agency of
matter, rather than inert and mechanical Asiatic racial form appears
as too lively and agentic. [Yellow Life becomes]{.underline}
**[impossible to pin down]{.underline}** [because it refuses to stay
within the proper boundaries of life, invading both the tiniest cells of
the body and entire nations in its expansive growth]{.underline}.
[Yellow Life becomes what must be immunized against, the munis that
threatens dissolution, the loss of individuality, and death for the
white possessive individual]{.underline} (Esposito 2008).

This is the outcome that may result if the reproductive desires like
those of "Want to Be a Dad" are met---that [our current state
of]{.underline} **[color-blind ideology]{.underline}** [is one that may
boast of multiculturalism but is still]{.underline} **[engrained with
racist]{.underline}** beliefs and **[desires]{.underline}**. At a time
when headlines include "The End of White America" (Hsu), perhaps it is
not too surprising that the emergence of designer babies and
reproductive technologies is a growing trend. In this light, [we are
currently witnessing the scientific and **technological manipulation of
the face of race**]{.underline}.

I introduce the implications of ART here in order to illustrate how
[race]{.underline} oftentimes [produces a power differentiation between
technology and reproduction]{.underline}. In 2013, not only are the
rates of nonwhite babies rising,3 but the parallel increase of biracial
and multiracial birthrates has fostered an atmosphere of what author
Danzy Senna has satirically referred to as the "Mulatto Millennium."
Alongside this change in demographics is our growing reliance on
biotechnology through which a parent can now select not only a child's
skin/ hair/eye color but also gender, athletic abilities, weight,
height, and susceptibility to certain diseases. In terms of race
selection, then, a white couple can have either their genetic white baby
(via a white or nonwhite gestational carrier) or a nonwhite baby using
an embryo adopted from a domestic or international agency. Despite not
sharing any genetic link, a white woman can birth a nonwhite baby and
nonwhite women can birth white babies.

Parents-to-be as well as ART practitioners place [restrictions upon
certain mixings]{.underline} that [mirror]{.underline} **[centuries-old
racial paradigms.]{.underline}** For example, during her ethnographic
research in the San Francisco Bay area, Gillian Goslinga-Roy uncovered
[racist ideologies where white surrogates refused to gestate a black
baby but welcomed an Asian baby]{.underline}. As "Julie," a white
surrogate, explains, "It feels foreign to me. Different. I could carry a
Japanese baby or a Chinese baby because they are white to me. Society
sees them as white. But a Black child is more difficult. I'm already
surrounded by controversy: I married a man thirtytwo years older than
me. I work in a late-term, problem-pregnancy abortion facility. And I'm
a surrogate. To give birth to a Black child would add one more
controversial aspect to my life and I'm not ready to be on the front
page of the National Enquirer" (116). Here, [gestating blackness is
a]{.underline} **[contamination]{.underline}** [too taboo to warrant
consideration]{.underline}. As Goslinga-Roy points out, what is telling
is "how carrying someone else's (white) child provoked no gut reaction
in her whatsoever. . . . But [the mere thought of carrying someone
else's Black child immediately made her experience the surrogacy as a
very intimate and at once very public violation of her bodily and moral
boundaries]{.underline}" (116). [In contrast]{.underline}, it is
important to point out that gestating a Japanese or Chinese baby is not
considered National Enquirer material. In other words, [Asian-white
mixes have overcome societal prohibition, symptomatic of broader
perceptions of Asians as the **model minority**]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} **[fear of racial contamination]{.underline}** [is
illustrated]{.underline} throughout the fertility treatment process
[in]{.underline} what Foucault would call [the "biopower"
of]{.underline} ART or the "[techniques \[used\] for achieving the
subjugations of bodies and the control of populations]{.underline}"
(140), [such as population control and selective
reproduction]{.underline}. By **[managing and manipulating racial
mixings]{.underline}**, ART practitioners become [arbiters of heredity
and the future look of race]{.underline}. In her study of fertility
technology, Seline Szkupinski Quiroga reveals how [racial borders are
policed and maintained]{.underline} during each step of the fertility
treatment process. For example, in describing the matching process
between sperm donor and recipient, she writes, "[The goal]{.underline}
of matching [is threefold: (1)]{.underline} to increase the probability
that [the child's physical characteristics will be similar enough to
suggest that the social parent]{.underline} could have [contributed his
own genetic material; (2) to mimic the physical attributes of
what]{.underline} **[white Americans]{.underline}** [perceive as
a]{.underline} **[biological family]{.underline}**; [and (3)
to]{.underline} maintain secrecy about the use of a donor by
[ensur]{.underline}ing that [the child could 'pass' as a genetic
child]{.underline} and not be mistaken as a product of the mother's
sexual infidelity" (150). Szkupinski Quiroga explains that while [the
first two goals are reflective of]{.underline} biologism or [the need
to]{.underline} ["look" like a natural family]{.underline}, [the last
goal reflects the]{.underline} "**[raced and gendered nature of the
heteropatriarchal family model]{.underline}**" (150). In other words,
the child cannot be interpreted as the visual evidence of the mother's
infidelity. Here, [the child's racial visibility/ decipherability is the
physical evidence of his/her mother's loyalty]{.underline} not only to
her husband but [to the family's genetics via the erasure of (her)
infertility]{.underline}.4 In the ART process, the mother's infidelity
is achieved only hypothetically via a mixed-race sexual union. In order
to prevent this, donor semen is "categorized racially, and sperm banks
rely on donor self-identification and physiognomy to assess the validity
of a donor's claim to whiteness" (150). Oftentimes, sperm vials are, in
fact, color-coded to match the donor's racial identification (black/
brown caps for African Americans, yellow caps for Asians, white caps for
Caucasians, and red caps for those with "unique ancestry" such as East
Indians, American Indians, Latinos, and mixed race individuals). Sperm
banks play race managers through careful cataloguing of various physical
characteristics in order to choose the "appropriate" donor. This
catalogue serves "as a proxy for proof of a donor's racial pedigree"
(150).

In contrast to the racist taboos and anxieties that black bodies, blood,
and genes still signify in ART, it is interesting to note that [Asian
genetics and bodies are in]{.underline} **[high demand]{.underline}** in
both ART and adoption. With all factors being equal (health of infant,
age, the adoption budget, the type of agency employed, etc.), white
babies demand higher costs and longer wait periods in domestic adoption
because they are the most desired. In contrast, [black or multiracial
babies are the least in demand]{.underline}, thus the cost and waiting
period for them are considerably lower, especially if one adopts via the
foster care program. One adoption agency, Wide Horizons for Children,
states on their website that "\[f \]amilies are especially needed for
children of African American heritage and children who may have a health
risk or concern." Here, **[blackness and disease and/or disability are
on par]{.underline}**. [On the contrary]{.underline}, Asian adoptions
compose about 60 percent of all international adoptions according to the
Department of Health and Human Services. Domestically, Asian American
adoption composes such a small number that reliable estimates could not
be generated; this disparity may be explained by the fact that very few
Asian American babies are placed in adoptions due to cultural or
religious taboos. Interestingly, however, [Asian eggs are a]{.underline}
**[hot commodity]{.underline}** [and demand as much as two or three
times the price of other eggs]{.underline} (and, as noted in a recent
Los Angeles Times article, up to a hundred thousand dollars[). "asian
egg donors needed" signs can be found all over]{.underline} **[Ivy
League college campuses]{.underline}**, for [if the donor boasts an Ivy
League pedigree with high SAT scores, she can command a higher
price]{.underline}. Demand is so high that some egg donor agencies, such
as the Asian Egg Donor Agency in New Jersey, specialize in Asian eggs.
As Stanford bioethics professor David Magnus writes, ["What we have
is]{.underline} **[the beginnings of the specter of
eugenics]{.underline}** . . . **[the makings of a super-race and a
slippery slope]{.underline}**. What we have is an actual egg selling,
not egg donation" ("Eggs from Young Asian Women in High Demand").

### Thesis\-\--Ornamentalism

#### Western imaginations produce an [Asiatic figure]{.underline} that is not only [racialized]{.underline}, but [gendered]{.underline}. The [technological bounds]{.underline} between [Being]{.underline} and [Thing]{.underline} produce [exclusionary binaries]{.underline} where Asiatic femininity is subjected to the [ornament]{.underline} of [Western fantasy]{.underline}. Only reimagining [subject-object ontology]{.underline} can create space for the Asian woman's [cybernetic ontological entanglement]{.underline}.

//CHC-DS 🐱‍👤

According to Cheng, [fully understanding the unique nature of western
constructions of Asiatic femininity demands a]{.underline} **[radical
reconfiguration]{.underline}** [of the binaries between personhood and
thingness]{.underline}. She offers the term Ornamentalism as a critical
lens to examine the relations between objectification, aestheticization,
and racialization in articulating a distinct ontology of and for the
Asian woman: [contrary to autonomous modes of being that arise from
natural bodies, the racialization of the Asian woman involves "a process
whereby personhood is conceived and suggested (legally, materially, and
imaginatively) through ornamental gestures \[\...\] that speak through
the minute, the sartorial, the **prosthetic**, and the
**decorative**"]{.underline} (Cheng 429). [The]{.underline} **[western
concept of the Person]{.underline}**---which Cheng traces to
Enlightenment thinkers such as John Locke and William Blackstone---[and
its idealization of the organic and integral body as designed by God is
thus **radically challenged**]{.underline}, [since the demarcations
between personhood and objecthood are violently collapsed in the
process]{.underline} (Cheng 436). [It is not (yellow) flesh that
constitutes a racialized body, but **ornament**]{.underline}. [There is
no Person, in the natural, embodied sense]{.underline}, to begin with,
[and one must imagine an]{.underline} **[alternative
ontology]{.underline}** [for a being that exists in a realm of
thingness]{.underline}.

For [the Asian woman]{.underline} who is constructed this way, it is not
the case that she is transformed into object, that is, objectified, but
rather that she [already exists as object; flesh and ornament amalgamate
in representations of this racialized figure.]{.underline} To make her
case, Cheng draws on a range of texts from Euro-American visual and
literary culture, while focusing heavily on the Metropolitan Museum of
Art's dazzling 2015 exhibition entitled China: Through the Looking
Glass. Indeed, the latter case, which featured more than 140 examples of
haute couture and avant-garde wear from renowned western designers such
as Yves Saint Laurent and John Galliano, was notable as it epitomizes
precisely the kind of lavish ornamental stylization typically used to
characterize Asian aesthetics. Looking at the clothing for female models
that are supposedly inspired by "a pastiche of Chinese aesthetic and
cultural traditions," one senses a recurring conflation between
materiality and organicity ("Exhibition Overview"). As highlighted by
Cheng, flesh and ornament are often synonymous in these sumptuous
pieces, as porcelain shards are laced into bodices and calligraphy
script becomes sartorial prints. Through the exotic vessel of
Chineseness and Asiatic femininity, the material ambiguity of the
garments effectively racializes the Asian woman as a being that is
defined by the ornamental. If this ontological formulation of the Asian
woman as object is true, we come to further realize how noteworthy it is
that the artificiality of Kyoko is signified in such a way as to
contrast the humanness of Ava; the objecthood of her being as yellow
woman overlaps with and extends the narrative of the Asian alien as
human simulacra, culminating in her racialized figure as uncannily
human-like but nonetheless inherently devoid of organic life.

Cheng's theory of [Ornamentalism]{.underline} is useful and highly
relevant to our discussion for multiple reasons. In addition to
examining the intersections between gender and race in Orientalizing the
Asian woman, it [highlights the importance of **aesthetic
style**]{.underline} [in the formal construction of]{.underline}
**[racial narratives]{.underline}**, thereby effectively [refuting
attempts]{.underline} such as those in Ex Machina [to trivialize the
role of racial signifiers in seemingly apolitical or post-racial
contexts]{.underline}. The aforementioned exhibition, for instance,
reclaims "postmodernism as a cure to Orientalism" by suggesting that the
artistic value of the displayed pieces should be disaggregated from
politics (Cheng 427). Such rhetoric is abundant in the museum's gallery
webpages, where China is designated as a "land of free-floating symbols"
that invites postmodern reinterpretation and reconstruction ("Exhibition
Galleries"). Indeed, even the exhibition title's use of the notion of
"looking glass," repeatedly referenced elsewhere as the collection's
unifying theme, suggests an exculpatory self-awareness of the distorting
effects of the western gaze. Under the guise of artistic creativity, the
exhibition thus attempts to completely shed the burden of cultural
authenticity by asserting that aesthetic style is innocuous and distinct
from broader cultural or political narratives that more explicitly
reflect ideologies of race.

China: Through the Looking Glass is not alone in exemplifying such
Orientalist practices; thus, while Said's critique of western portrayals
of a decadent Asia as Other remains valid, it does not as adequately
emphasize the specific processes by which such aesthetic style itself is
a gendered mechanism of racialization. [Under the framework of
Ornamentalism, we are not only able to recognize the]{.underline}
**[gendered nature]{.underline}** [of the ethnic-cultural
fetishization]{.underline} reflected by these garments, [but to also
understand why the west is]{.underline} **[persistently driven to
denote]{.underline}** Asia and **[Asiatic femininity]{.underline}**
[with particular ornamental styles we see among this "land of
free-floating symbols."]{.underline} This enduring figure of the
faceless female mannequin, always garnished with breathtakingly
extravagant fabrics, textures, and appendages found throughout the
collection, thus signifies for the western imagination a particular kind
of person of desire. Instead of arbitrarily curating a pastiche of signs
for aesthetic pleasure, [the west has constructed a specific
constellation of traits that racialize a being that is already
characterized as an object]{.underline}. Looking back to our survey on
the typology of western techno-Orientalist texts, we further see how
this narrative of aesthetic style as seemingly raceless is similarly at
play, as the mystifying Chinese character signboards typical in various
SF settings are not inconsequential backgrounds but instead constitute a
particular style that is inherently Orientalizing, even as these texts
aim to prophesize a future that is less concerned with race than the
fundamental biologies of human and machine.

Ultimately, Ornamentalism also presents a unique avenue to examine [the
figure of the]{.underline} **[cyborg]{.underline}** as it [encapsulates
the challenges of]{.underline} **[(re)defining
subjectivity]{.underline}** [within the techno-Orientalist
narrative]{.underline}. Looking at the exhibition pieces on display in
Looking Glass, which were assembled in juxtaposition to physical
artifacts such as ceramics and paintings while using the same patterns
on these objects for their design, we not only get the sense that they
are meant to enact a particular mechanism of racialization for the Asian
woman, but also that they subvert the notions of objecthood itself.
Cheng suggests that [what is ultimately at play is a foregrounding of
the object's primacy that is only made legible through the racial
significations of the ornamental Asian woman]{.underline} (Cheng 435).
[This]{.underline} **[unique ontological entanglement]{.underline}**
[with objecthood is significant in questioning subject-object relations
not only as they pertain to perceptions of female Asian bodies, but also
to the viewer's own understanding of their human condition]{.underline},
as Ornamentalism facilitates the recognition that [objecthood is part of
being human]{.underline}. As Cheng explains eloquently, "while
Orientalism is about turning persons into things that can be possessed
and dominated, [ornamentalism is about a fantasy of turning things into
persons through the conduit of racial meaning in order, paradoxically,
to allow us to abandon our humanness]{.underline}" (Cheng 435). Thus, as
a concept, Ornamentalism [spotlights the crisis of modern life that
Asiatic femininity]{.underline} **[personifies]{.underline}**, [where it
seems increasingly difficult to reconcile ideals of the purely organic
body with visions of a technology-driven future]{.underline}. More
broadly, Ornamentalism [challenges the long-standing western traditions
that view the object as a subordinate byproduct of the natural subject
within the subject-object dichotomy, prompting us to **radically
reimagine** more diverse modes of personhood and being]{.underline}.

We now see how Ornamentalism as an extension of Saidian Orientalism has
immense potential in initiating conversations on alternative forms of
being that challenge the categories of human and artificial, especially
those pertaining to cyberspace and cyborg bodies. [If the Asian woman
has always been a product of the synthetic, then she is in a
sense]{.underline} "**[the original cyborg]{.underline}**," [compelling
us to]{.underline} **[rethink]{.underline}** the **[desires and
anxieties]{.underline}** [surrounding materiality and
artificiality]{.underline} (Cheng 433). In Donna [Haraway's]{.underline}
1985 Cyborg Manifesto, the [notion of the cyborg]{.underline}---an
abstract fusion between machine and organic matter---[offers a utopian
promise of a postmodern, genderless world]{.underline} that rejects
essentialist and naturalist identity politics rooted in western
heteropatriarchy (Haraway 7). [The limitations of Haraway's cyborg
become]{.underline} especially [clear now as we consider the figure of
the Asian woman, who needs no bodily enhancement or modification to
deprive her of organicity]{.underline}. [Her]{.underline} **[cybernetic
genealogy]{.underline}** [as traced through the western imagination
predates]{.underline} what Haraway sees as [technologically-aided
liberation in the late twentieth century, since she has always existed
ambiguously along the boundaries of Person and thing.]{.underline} She
is thus crucial to understanding the expressions of modern personhood
and life, where [ideals of the natural, integrated individual are
threatened not only by the potential fusion between technology,
ornament, and flesh, but also by the emerging desires we hold towards
confronting our own humanness as modern subjects]{.underline}.

The [defense of]{.underline} **[techno-Orientalist
militarism]{.underline}** [has become]{.underline} **[literally
hardwired]{.underline}** [into American political
institutions]{.underline}. The [cultivated need for enemies for
Americans to define themselves against was complicated when
the]{.underline} supposedly intractable [Soviet Union
crumbled]{.underline} under its own weight to everyone's surprise in
1991. **[Think tanks]{.underline}** [such as the Center for Security
Policy]{.underline}, founded by Reagan's former Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense (and CPD member) Frank Gaffney in 1988, [and the
Middle East Forum]{.underline}, founded in 1990 by Pipes's son Daniel
Pipes, [scrambled to find]{.underline} **[new spectral
enemies]{.underline}** [endangering the world's largest military in
order to maintain their political influence]{.underline}. These [think
tanks repurposed and remade]{.underline} **[security
discourse]{.underline}** [rooted in the idea of an intractable
civilizational clash between]{.underline} the West and communism into
one between [the West and the rest---]{.underline}simply [recasting new
actors into the well-established roles of American strategic
drama]{.underline} (Little 226--266). The [neoconservative]{.underline}
Project for a New American Century ([PNAC]{.underline}) [outlined the
necessity for a more aggressive stance against China and
Iraq]{.underline} under the title Present Dangers, edited by Robert
Kagan and William Kristol (vii) in its bid to revive a "Reaganite policy
of military strength and moral clarity." When PNAC-supported George W.
Bush assumed the presidency later that year, his advisors (including
former CPD member Paul Wolfowitz) immediately began
**[strategizing]{.underline}** [about how to scare the American people
and Congress into **another round of war** against intractable Oriental
enemies]{.underline}. However, even the pursuit of this
techno-Orientalist fantasy betrayed its own ambivalence. The U.S.
military named the December 2003 hunt for deposed Iraqi leader (and
former U.S. ally) Saddam Hussein "Operation Red Dawn," and code named
his two suspected hiding places "Wolverine 1" and "Wolverine 2"---as if
to suggest that the United States was the overpowering evil occupying
force in "Indian country," and Hussein an Iraqi hiding in the hills to
lead a patriotic resistance (Sirota 139--169). Nonetheless, as Americans
increasingly equated the mounting failures in Iraq to the failures in
Vietnam three decades before, [hawkish politicians sought to remake and
refocus the war's goals by founding a]{.underline} short-lived [third
CPD]{.underline} in 2004 [dedicated to channeling American fears of
government manipulation toward the threat radical Islamic terrorists
pose to the safety of the world]{.underline} (Barry).

These examples perfectly illustrate our definition of
techno-Orientalism: the phenomenon of imagining Asia and Asians in hypo-
or hypertechnological terms in cultural productions and political
discourse.4 **[Techno-Orientalist imaginations]{.underline}** [are
infused with the]{.underline} **[languages]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[codes]{.underline}** [of the technological and the
futuristic]{.underline}. These [developed alongside industrial advances
in the West]{.underline} and have become [part of the **West's project
of securing dominance**]{.underline} [as architects of the future, a
project that requires configurations of the East as the very technology
with which to shape it]{.underline}. [Techno-Orientalist speculations of
an]{.underline} **[Asianized future]{.underline}** [have become ever
more prevalent in the wake of]{.underline} **[neoliberal trade
policies]{.underline}** [that enable]{.underline}d [greater flow of
information and capital]{.underline} between the East and the West.
Substantial criticism of techno-Orientalism emerged in the mid-1990s
when cultural theorists began to trace its manifestations and theorize
its causes and implications. Kevin Morley and David Robins, Toshiya
Ueno, and Kumiko Sato, principal trailblazers of the field, laid much of
the valuable groundwork. Morley and Robins's Spaces of Identity: Global
Media, Electronic Landscapes, and Cultural Boundaries (Routledge, 1995),
in which a definition of "techno-Orientalism" first saw print, remains
the most cited in critical assessments of technological and Orientalist
discourses; however, Ueno has probably written most extensively about
techno-Orientalism as a discursive cultural phenomenon in the era of
what he identifies as the "post-Fordist social environment of
globalization" (223). "T[he basis of Orientalism and xenophobia is the
subordination of Others through a sort of '**mirror of cultural
conceit**,']{.underline}" Ueno explains. "[**The Orient exists in so far
as the West needs it**, because it brings the project of the West into
focus"]{.underline} (223).

Whereas Orientalism, as a strategy of representational containment,
arrests Asia in traditional, and often premodern imagery,
[techno-Orientalism presents a broader, dynamic, and often contradictory
spectrum of images]{.underline}, constructed by the East and West alike,
[of an **"Orient"**]{.underline} [undergoing rapid economic and cultural
transformations]{.underline}. Techno-Orientalism, like Orientalism,
[places great emphasis on the]{.underline} **[project of
modernity]{.underline}**---[cultures privilege modernity and fear losing
their perceived "edge" over others]{.underline}. Stretching beyond
Orientalism's premise of a hegemonic West's representational authority
over the East, techno-Orientalism's scope is much more expansive and
bidirectional, its discourses mutually constituted by the flow of trade
and capital across the hemispheres. As Ueno observes, techno-Orientalism
is first and foremost an effect of globalism. "[If the Orient was
invented by the West]{.underline}," he writes, "[then]{.underline}
**[the Techno-Orient was also invented by the world of information
capitalism]{.underline}**" (228). [Technological
developments]{.underline}, driven by the imperial aspirations and the
appetites of consumerist societies on both sides of the Pacific, [propel
the engines of invention and production. In its wake, Western nations
vying for cultural and economic dominance with Asian nations find in
technoOrientalism an **expressive vehicle for their aspirations and
fears**]{.underline}. Our volume, Techno-Orientalism: Imagining Asia in
Speculative Fiction, History, and Media, documents past and current
constructions of the role of Asia in a technologized future and
critically examines this proliferating phenomenon.

Dr. Fu Manchu illustrates just one way in which techno-Orientalist
imagery pervades Western cultural productions in the early twentieth
century. The [principal locales of techno-Orientalist
projects]{.underline} as they developed in the late twentieth century
[have primarily been Japan and China]{.underline}. Ueno, whose
influential analyses of "Japanimation" in the mid-1990s seeded the field
of technoOrientalist studies, observes, "[In
Techno-Orientalism]{.underline}, **[Japan is not only located
geographically, but]{.underline}** is also projected
**[chronologically]{.underline}**. Jean **[Baudrillard]{.underline}**
once [called Japan a satellite in orbit. Now Japan has been located in
the]{.underline} **[future of technology]{.underline}**" (228). Morley
and Robins put a finer point on the temporal dimension of the spatial
construction: "[If the future is technological, and if technology has
become 'Japanised,' then the syllogism would suggest that the future is
now Japanese, too.]{.underline} **[The postmodern era will be the
Pacific era.]{.underline}** [Japan is the future, and it is a future
that seems to be transcending and displacing Western
modernity]{.underline}" (168).

Whereas Japan's dubious honor as the original techno-Orient was bestowed
in the eighties with the help of the cyberpunk movement, the
techno-Orientalizing of China occurred roughly a decade later.5 China
was not yet a competitor in the global economy in the 1980s, when the
West focused its wary gaze on what it saw as an invasion of Japanese
capital investments and imports into Western economies. [When China was
recognized as a newly industrialized country (NIC)]{.underline} in the
1990s and its influence in the global economy increased, [it, too,
became]{.underline} once again [a target of techno-Orientalist
fashioning]{.underline}. The [**discourse on China's "rise"** in the
U.S. context]{.underline}, **[consistent with techno-Orientalist
contradictions]{.underline}**, [has focused on constructing its people
as a vast, subaltern-like labor force and as a giant consumer market
whose appetite for Western cultural products, if nurtured, could secure
U.S. global cultural and economic dominance]{.underline}. This dual
image of China as both developing-world producers and firstworld
consumers presents a representational challenge for the West: Is China a
human factory? Or is it a consumerist society, like the United States,
whose enormous purchasing power dictates the future of technological
innovations and economies?

[Japan and China]{.underline} are thus signified differently in the
techno-Orientalist vocabulary. [Both are constructed as competitors and
therefore threats to the U.S. economy;]{.underline} but [while Japan
competes with the United States for dominance in technological
innovation, China competes with the United States in labor and
production]{.underline}. To put it in starker terms, Japan creates
technology, but China is the technology. [In the eyes of the West, both
are crucial engines of the future: Japan innovates and China
manufactures]{.underline}. And [as Asia, writ large, becomes a greater
consumerist force than the West]{.underline},6 [its threat/value dualism
commensurately increases]{.underline}. [These differences]{.underline}
in the technological signification of Japan and China [manifest
themselves in the]{.underline} **[fictive forecasts of the Asiantinged
future]{.underline}**. If Japan is a screen on which the West has
projected its technological fantasies, then [China is a screen on which
the **West projects its fears** of being colonized, mechanized, and
instrumentalized in its own pursuit of technological
dominance]{.underline}.

India, another NIC, has also found itself under the techno-Orientalist
gaze as a consequence of U.S. outsourcing practices. As a much maligned
business strategy, outsourcing has provoked extremely negative public
sentiments in the United States. These opinions find expression in a
particular strand of techno-Orientalist discourse that consolidates
China and India as the chief threats to the U.S. service and labor
sectors. These [Asian nations serve as the]{.underline}
**[scapegoats]{.underline}** [for corporate decisions to move service
and manufacturing jobs abroad and bear the brunt of the resulting
xenophobic antipathies]{.underline}. Chinese and Indian workers, for
instance, are routinely portrayed in techno-Orientalist and technophobic
vocabularies; call center employees in India adopt Western Christian
names and mimic the linguistic and idiomatic style of Americans, a
practice so ubiquitous as to be parodied cinematically in romantic
comedies such as Outsourced (2006), conjuring images of Dickian androids
(or Blade Runner's "replicants") who simulate human behavior and
threaten the distinction between "real" and "fake" Americans. Glossy
spreads of endless rows of Chinese workers in corporate factories and
towns in mainstream magazines such as Time and Wired seal the visual
vocabulary of Asians as the cogs of hyperproduction. In the NIC
contexts, [techno-Orientalist discourse constructs]{.underline}
**[Asians as mere simulacra]{.underline}** [and maintains a prevailing
sense of the]{.underline} **[inhumanity]{.underline}** [of Asian
labor---**the very antithesis**]{.underline} [of Western liberal
humanism]{.underline}.

#### In hypermodernity, the technological Other becomes [more West than West]{.underline}, removing the [Trans-Pacific encounter]{.underline}. Only by [critically embracing]{.underline} our signifier-as-futurity can we [circumvent]{.underline} Western modernity.

While Orientalism as a critical lens describes how [Western discourse
discursively catalogues or frames the East]{.underline}, it has
[always]{.underline} been [trained on]{.underline} domestic--- that is,
[Western or U.S.]{.underline}---[configurations against the Orientalized
Other]{.underline}. Edward Said notes his "real argument is that
[Orientalism]{.underline} is---and does not simply represent---a
considerable dimension of modern political-intellectual culture, and as
such [has less to do with the Orient than it does with 'our'
world]{.underline}" (12). **[Techno-Orientalism]{.underline}**, [with a
vision of the future that is global in scope and reach, adds a wrinkle
to the critical commonplace that Orientalism actively **produces and
reproduces an oppositional East** to **cement Western
hegemony**]{.underline}. Particularly within the realm of SF,
[techno-Orientalist tropes have been absorbed, reenvisioned,
and]{.underline} **[replicated]{.underline}** [by other sites of
cultural production, with]{.underline} interesting [geopolitical
implications]{.underline}.8 For example, Sato writes that Japan's entry
into cyberpunk SF reinvigorates nihonjinron, the idea of an essentialist
Japanese superiority that was integral to its imperialist project. With
Japan's surrender in 1945, however, the idea of nihonjinron lost
currency--- that is, until it was reenabled by cyberpunk fiction in the
1980s. Sato observes [that it was]{.underline}
**[cyberpunk]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}
**[resurrected]{.underline}** the idea of [Japanese essentialism: "This
proud announcement of revived Japaneseness requited through the cutting
edge of American culture means that the two separate histories of the
West and Japan---the former modernizing, the latter behind---coincide in
the discovery of Japan in American cyberpunk"]{.underline} (346). That
proves troublesome, she argues, because it assumes Japanese essentialism
as the primary reason for Japan's economic and technological
achievements. For example, [two paradigmatic cyberpunk
works,]{.underline} **[Ghost in the Shell]{.underline}** (1995)
[and]{.underline} Chōhei Kambayashi's novel **[Yukikaze]{.underline}**
(1985), [have strong female cyborg leads paired with weaker, male
companions]{.underline}. [While Western cyberpunk seeks to
claim]{.underline} **[liberal humanist subjectivity]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[modernity]{.underline}**, having [a female cyborg
subject allows Japan to]{.underline} **[circumvent]{.underline}** [the
question of subjectivity and modernity altogether]{.underline}. In both
works, **[the male]{.underline}** (**[Western]{.underline}**) **[subject
is deflated and removed from the center]{.underline}**, [while the
cybernetic female embraces technology over humanity, allowing the
insertion of]{.underline} **[Japan-as-signifier of
futurity]{.underline}** [based on the constructed image of the West's
Othering of technology and Asia]{.underline}. In other words, a Japan
manufactured by the West can further ethnocentric or nationalist
projects on both fronts. Techno-Orientalist discourse, in this case, has
been reified in another nationalist context, further demonstrating its
discursive hegemony as it serves a site other than its point of origin.

The Western fixation on Asian futurism indicates just how important it
is to approach techno-Orientalism from several vantages. William Gibson
is perhaps the most renowned exemplar of the West's fascination with the
technologized Asian subject, evident in his unapologetic rhapsodizing in
a 2001 issue of Wired, but even he merits a second look: "Dining late,
in a plasticdraped gypsy noodle stall in Shinjuku, the classic cliché
better-than-Blade Runner Tokyo street set, I scope my neighbor's phone
as he checks his text messages. Wafer-thin, Kandy Kolor pearlescent
white, complexly curvilinear, totally ephemeral looking, its screen
seethes with a miniature version of Shinjuku's neon light show. . . .
Tokyo has been my handiest prop shop for as long as I've been writing:
sheer eye candy" (Gibson, "My Own Private Tokyo"). Gibson's meditation
touches upon the multipronged reach of techno-Orientalist discourse---he
references the dystopic, Asianized cinematic vision of Los Angeles; he
admits drawing upon Tokyo's luminescence for his literary well; and it
is the "ephemeral looking" mobile phone that inspires him to imagine new
media, as he did with cyberspace in Neuromancer. Essentially, Gibson
admits that the futurism he reads in Tokyo is largely superficial
("sheer eye candy"); the phone appears to be futuristic simply because
of its alien surroundings, and his own somewhat tautological belief in
Tokyo as his futuristic "prop shop."

But more interestingly, Gibson credits Japan's encounters with the West
as the central reason for its present status as a site of the future. He
explains, "\[T\]he nation of Japan \[swallowed\] whole the entirety of
the Industrial Revolution. The resulting spasms were violent, painful,
and probably inconceivably disorienting. The Japanese bought the entire
train-set: clock-time, steam railroads, electric telegraphy, Western
medical advances. . . . The result of this stupendous triple-whammy
(catastrophic industrialisation, the war, the American occupation) is
the Japan that delights, disturbs and fascinates us today" (Gibson,
"Modern Boys and Mobile Girls"). That is, [to understand Japan as the
site of the future, one must first read its historical introduction to
technology by]{.underline} (and, to the Western eye, its embrace of )
[the West.]{.underline} In a wonderfully circular way, Gibson touches
upon the tautological aspect of techno-Orientalism: [the Japanese are
technologically advanced and therefore culturally fascinating now
because of]{.underline} **[past Western modernizing]{.underline}**
[interventions in the Eastern sphere]{.underline}. In Gibson's history,
[the West has created a]{.underline} **[hyperfuturistic
Japan]{.underline}**; and in this vision, **[Japan is
now]{.underline}**, in a sense, **[more West than the
West]{.underline}**, **[a simulacrum that threatens the foundational
fiction of the West as Future.]{.underline}**

It would be easy to dismiss Gibson's liberties with Japanese culture as
a symptom of his misreading of his muse, but our instinct tells us that
would be too simple. Instead, we are interested in the potentials for
contrapuntal dialogism in such engagements. [Parodic and reciprocal
appropriations of technoOrientalism in Asian cultural
productions]{.underline}, for example, [have opened up spaces
for]{.underline} **[artistic and intellectual critique]{.underline}**.
Yet some remain skeptical of the effects of such appropriations. Ueno
regards techno-Orientalism as a metanarrative that has become "an
epistemological apparatus for Japanese to misunderstand themselves, and
for Westerners to misunderstand others" (qtd. in Oda 250). Elaborating
on Ueno's skepticism, artist and cultural anthropologist Masanori Oda
observes in an essay [on]{.underline} what he calls ["the present
Post-Orientalist moment,"]{.underline} ["Japanese anime, manga, and
games are becoming a]{.underline} kind of **['contact
zone']{.underline}** [for the West to meet the latest
Japan/ese]{.underline}. What is different from the old Orientalism is
that both parties ( Japanese and Occidental) hold a kind of reciprocity.
[This means that the Japan/ese often appear as **'as you
like,'**]{.underline} [selffashioned figures to the West,]{.underline}
**[not only to satisfy their own gaze, but to disguise the real
portrayal of their own nature or desires]{.underline}**, as if to say,
'This figure is not so bad for me'" (250). Oda's skepticism rests
chiefly with the mediatory capacity of techno-Orientalist discourses.
["There may be a contact between both parties,"]{.underline} he
cautions, ["but]{.underline} **[there is never an
encounter]{.underline}**, **[much less an uncanny
experience]{.underline}**. Thus, [mutual misconceptions
accumulate"]{.underline} (251). Indeed, numerous examples of Oda's
notion of "contact without encounter" are identified and critiqued in
the essays collected in this volume. It is this effect of "contact
without encounter" [produced by techno-Orientalist
discourses]{.underline} that our volume seeks to call out and
counteract. If technology has come to mediate "contact" between East and
West through techno-Orientalist discourses, [how, then, might we fashion
representational technologies that engender "**encounter**" **rather
than empty contact**]{.underline}?

#### Techno-Orientalism is locked in a [mirror stage]{.underline} of [reflecting anxieties]{.underline} onto the Asian other. *[Real]{.underline}* Asian Americans [only exist in the future]{.underline}, not the present, and [alternative realities]{.underline}, not this one.

IS IT POSSIBLE to be othered across time? For almost a century already,
[the myth of an Asian-inflected future has infiltrated imaginations
worldwide]{.underline}. Vivid [tableaux of the continent's cities in
hyperdrive, fueled by tech-enabled consumerism, come to mind with
ease]{.underline}: Think of the vertical neon signs, the sleep-deprived
gamers, the flesh-meets-machine of conveyor-belt sushi. Meanwhile,
recent art history serves up examples of Asian artists (and East Asian
artists in particular) whose pieces lay ground for even more fantastic
futures to come: narratives populated by cyborg love and virtual-reality
metropolises. In previous decades there were, of course, Nam June Paik's
televisions and robots, then Lee Bul's cyborgs; now one finds the trippy
digital self-portraits of Lu Yang, and Transmedia Lab's robot arm
programmed to duplicate Buddhist scripture.

In 1986, describing the United States, Jean Baudrillard touched on what
the country was not: Japan. Specifically, a [Japan]{.underline} that
[had managed "an]{.underline} **[unintelligible paradox]{.underline}**,
[to transform the power of territoriality and feudalism into that of
deterritoriality and weightlessness."]{.underline} "Japan," he
continued, "is **[already a satellite of the planet
Earth]{.underline}**." Taking up where he left off, David Morley and
Kevin Robins laid out an articulation of techno-Orientalism a few years
later, observing that [Japan's path to modernization had become a
crucial aspect of its **exoticized image**]{.underline} [as an Oriental
other, an image construed to reflect the same]{.underline} **[Western
anxieties]{.underline}** [that drove the historical violence
of]{.underline} **[colonialism]{.underline}**, **[racism]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[exclusion]{.underline}**. Yet even as their words
set the stage for many a conversation about the formation and
transformation of Asian identity through the channels of diaspora and
distance, ever-newer avatars of techno-Orientalism continue to be
reflected in both high art and low culture. Perhaps, critic Toshiya Ueno
suggested, [techno-Orientalism loops back on itself]{.underline} or
serves [as]{.underline} "**[a]{.underline}** kind of **[mirror stage or
an image machine]{.underline}**" [whose effects ultimately touch
everyone]{.underline}. Focusing on Japan, Ueno wrote, "[It is through
this mirror stage and its cultural apparatus that Western or other
people misunderstand and fail to recognize an]{.underline} **[always
illusory]{.underline}** Japanese **[culture]{.underline}**, but it also
is the mechanism through which Japanese misunderstand themselves."

As the worldwide preoccupation in the 1980s with Japan's unassailably
ascendant technological dominance has given way to worldwide
consternation over the still-unfolding effects of neoliberal
globalization on an array of Pacific Rim nations, [the idea that East
Asian countries have any exceptional claim to futurity has grown more
complex]{.underline}. But if the nuances of techno-Orientalism evolve
with the times, [visions of Asia-futurism continue to be]{.underline}
**[mirrored]{.underline}**, **[magnified]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[distorted in the Western world]{.underline}**
[toward complicated ends, with complicated effects on]{.underline} both
contemporary art production and [an already troubled construction of
Asian American identity]{.underline}.

Amid the contentious identity politics of this year's Academy Awards,
host Chris Rock introduced three children of Asian descent to the stage
as accountants and smartphone makers. If stereotypes were writ large
(child laborers! Numbers savants!), what went virtually unnoticed was
the fact that these children were, on some level, embodied archetypes of
Asia-futurity: The only truly visible Asian people at the Dolby Theatre
that night, they will reach their prime in coming decades. This, in
turn, seemed to reflect a larger fact of Hollywood casting. Putting
aside the more prominent discussions around the mass media's outright
erasure of actors of color (exemplified by Scarlett Johansson's casting
as the protagonist of the upcoming Ghost in the Shell remake), the TV
narratives that consistently cast Asian actors are still primarily
science fiction and fantasy. [When real Asian
Americans]{.underline}---by which I mean people and not
stereotypes---[appear in media, we do so in **the future, but not the
present**;]{.underline} [in]{.underline} **[alternate realities, but not
this one]{.underline}**. As underscored by many critics of
techno-Orientalism, Joss Whedon's early-aughts cult television show
Firefly imagined a world in which China and the US had evolved into one
empire, with not a single Asian actor in a major role. Whedon's more
recent portrayal of a sci-fi universe---the ongoing (and highly
entertaining) Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.---demonstrates some progress: It
includes a Chinese American actress and another of mixed-race Chinese
heritage as leads. The latter character turns out to be a sort of
special egg: a member of the Inhumans, a genetically advanced race whose
full powers must be triggered by the Terrigen Mists. She is someone who,
much like the Asian children at the Oscars, is awaiting Life, Phase Two.

development.]{.underline} In making cases for or against these futures,
**[utopian/dystopian texts]{.underline}** [are test balloons for
measuring possible destinies for the present]{.underline}.1 [Is that
envisioned future one of, say, the orderly liberation of the oppressed
and benighted or a chaotic hegemony of inequality and exploitation? The
place of Asia in that future becomes an index of success or failure. Is
the West's future more Asian or less Asian, and which is
preferable?]{.underline}

[Both technology and Orientalism have fueled engines of economic
growth]{.underline}. A key difference is that [technology still tends to
be celebrated as innovative and life-saving, and Orientalism is a relic
of racist and exploitative imperialism]{.underline}. On the power of
technology, Martin Heidegger, for example, in "The Question Concerning
Technology," suggestively writes, ["**Technology is a mode of
revealing**]{.underline}. [Technology comes to presence in the realm
where revealing and unconcealment take place, where aletheia, truth,
happens"]{.underline} (13). Technology has also been [the site
of]{.underline} **[profound anxieties about the future]{.underline}**,
[particularly the eclipsing of such quaint notions as discernible
reality]{.underline}. Writing in 1936 about the emergent medium of
cinema, Walter Benjamin, for example, in "The Work of Art in the Age of
Mechanical Reproduction," observes, "[The equipment-free aspect of
reality has become the]{.underline} **[height of
artifice]{.underline}**; the sight of [immediate reality has become
an]{.underline} **[orchid in the land of
technology]{.underline}**.["]{.underline} [As technology becomes more
advanced, it develops a deft capacity to]{.underline}
**[conceal]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} otherwise
**[normalize]{.underline}** [its apparatuses]{.underline}, which can
ironically be increasingly equipment-laden.

[Orientalism can be understood as a once-normalized apparatus for
grasping reality]{.underline}. With the rise of decolonization, the ills
of Orientalism are now more readily identifiable. What was once a sleek
system for civilizing the world is revealed as a clunky ethnocentrism of
the so-called West needing an incorporable alterity to be its frontier,
materially and ideologically.

### Thesis\-\--Stereotypes

#### Racist stereotypes [aesthetically detain]{.underline} Asianness in the [uncanny valley]{.underline}, reproducing [revulsion]{.underline} and [phobia]{.underline} at the [yellow body]{.underline}.

Like their fellow humanoid artifacts, stereotypes can elicit a spectrum
of human responses. Just as not all robots are uncanny, not all
stereotypes are uncanny. There is nothing inherently uncanny, for
example, about stereotypes such as "dog lover," "Sox fan," "vegan,"
"science fiction enthusiast," and so on. Problems arise, however, when
[stereotypes are]{.underline} **[engineered]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[fabricate, automate, and mechanically reproduce
uncanny feelings]{.underline}** [in response to certain "types" of
people]{.underline}. An uncanny stereotype [elicits intellectual
uncertainty over whether a "type" of person is genuinely human and
alive]{.underline}. The uncanniest stereotypes [elicit]{.underline}
**[revulsion]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[profound
phobia]{.underline}** [in response to the person]{.underline}(s)
stereotyped as uncanny. Often [the manufacture of such uncanny
stereotypes happens in the context of]{.underline} **[war and
colonialism]{.underline}**. [Just as individual members of ethnic groups
have found themselves detained in prisons and internment camps, ethnic
stereotypes have often found themselves]{.underline} **[aesthetically
detained in the uncanny valley]{.underline}**.

Indeed, the [detention of "yellow peril" stereotypes in the uncanny
valley during World War II corresponded to the detention]{.underline} by
the U.S. government [of thousands of Japanese Americans]{.underline} in
the wake of Pearl Harbor. This correspondence is substantiated by an
[infamous]{.underline} December 1941 [article in LIFE titled "How to
Tell Japs from the Chinese: Angry Citizens Victimize Allies with
Emotional Outburst at Enemy."]{.underline} Occupying less than two
pages, this article [claims the scholarly authority of "physical
anthropologists"]{.underline} and "adduces a rule-of-thumb from the
anthropometric conformations that distinguish friendly Chinese from
enemy alien Japs" (81). Such authority, however, falls apart under
scrutiny. Almost all of the article's rhetorical impact is generated not
by logical argumentation but by the illogical interaction between the
verbal text and the accompanying visual images. While the annotated
photographs of Ong Wen-hao and Hideki Tojo might seem to convey an aura
of scientific fact, in truth the diagrams [constitute an exercise
in]{.underline} **[Orientalist physiognomic fantasy]{.underline}**. The
annotations are riddled with anatomical errors and misinformation. For
example, the foremost detail noted in each diagram--- [**"yellow
complexion**"---is inaccurate, whether such yellowness is specified as
"parchment"]{.underline} (upper diagram) [or "earthy"]{.underline}
(lower diagram). As Michael Keevak demonstrates in Becoming Yellow: A
Short History of Racial Thinking (2011), the [misattribution of yellow
skin to East Asians originated in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries]{.underline}. Moreover, the annotation "epicanthic fold" draws
the viewer's attention to the wrong part of the eye. The term actually
refers to a fold of skin over the eye's inner angle. (The prefix "epi-"
means "upon" or "over," while "canthus" refers to any angle formed by
the intersection of the upper and lower eyelids.) In the diagram,
however, the phrase "epicanthic fold" is shown as pointing to a crease
in the upper eyelid. Perhaps most important, contrary to the article's
claims, [no individual can be characterized as "representative" of an
entire "anthropological group."]{.underline}

### Thesis\-\--Technological Sublime

#### The resolution invokes the [technological sublime]{.underline}, where we become [obsessed]{.underline} with [violent imagery of modern warfare]{.underline}. This imagery is an [aesthetic imagination]{.underline} that props up Western [heroic narratives]{.underline} against the savage Orientalized enemy, [securing anxieties]{.underline} of [White masculinity]{.underline}.

While [Japan's march toward world power status was]{.underline}
generally celebrated in America, it [was also filtered through the
West's]{.underline} **[complex emotional response]{.underline}** [to
race and emergent technologies]{.underline}, and [infused
with]{.underline} **[trepidation]{.underline}** [over an Asian power
dominating a white one]{.underline}. Some Americans found this turn of
events inspiring. "White supremacy is getting a terrible black eye in
and about Manchuria and Mukden," wrote the Seattle Republican in March
1905, one of many African American newspapers that saw Japanese victory
as a subversively powerful triumph for racial equality in an age of Jim
Crow and lynching (qtd. in Kearney 35). Even W.E.B. Du Bois became a
"Japanophile" approving the "fear of colored revolt against white
exploitation" that Japanese victories produced (Kearney 19, 30, 38,
168).

White Americans' assessment of Japan's rise was more ambivalent.
[Concerns about "race decadence" bumped against the]{.underline}
**[technological sublime]{.underline}**, [a state of awe attached to the
creations of modern science]{.underline}. Enlightenment thinkers like
Immanuel Kant and Edmund Burke had posited that [confrontations with
terror in the form of great natural forces could elevate observers to a
"heightened awareness of reason." With the advent of the]{.underline}
**[Machine Age]{.underline}**, [some felt that a similar astonishment
from encounters with emerging technologies might lead to society's
betterment]{.underline}. In fact, David Nye sees American culture's
celebration of nature-controlling technologies, in awe-inspiring shared
experiences like the **[completion of the transcontinental
railroad]{.underline}**, [as central to the narrative of American
greatness]{.underline} from the nineteenth century onward, forming
unities across political, religious, regional, and class divides (3,
6--9, 22, 27).

**[War]{.underline}** was another fraught activity that could
[potentially unify Americans in purpose]{.underline}, and [the
experience of]{.underline} [**modern warfare** at the turn of the
twentieth century supplanted nature as "the exemplary object or trigger
of the sublime"]{.underline} (Ray 134). Likening the horrors of war to
the "cunning of nature," Kant acknowledged that ["war has something
sublime about it"]{.underline} and experiencing its surprises and
cruelties might spur humanity toward transcendence. Alleging that both
savage and civilized peoples held "superior esteem for the warrior"
whose heroism "does not yield to danger but promptly sets to work with
vigor and full deliberation," Kant also allowed that the [sublime
experience of battle could forge]{.underline} national or **[racial
unities]{.underline}** as well as strengthen a nation's commitment to
moral freedom (Neculau 36--38; Licht 23--25)

The [harnessing of the war sublime]{.underline} ([which
complements]{.underline} and exhibits aspects of [the technological
sublime]{.underline}) [for]{.underline} **[ideological
purposes]{.underline}** [has been an enduring factor in American
history]{.underline}. Looking at the recent **[war in
Iraq]{.underline}**, François [Debrix notes how **Orientalism**
and]{.underline} **[confrontation with violent imagery]{.underline}**
[continue in America's]{.underline} **["aesthetic
imagination"]{.underline}** [of war as mobilizing factors in the quest
for public approval]{.underline}: "This sublime aesthetic of war,
relayed by contemporary media and popular cultural forms . . . consists
of [producing **spectacular, violent and shocking images** of 'others'
in distress or harm's way in places where America's wars are being
fought]{.underline}. . . . \[I\]t is [an ideology that postulates that
only Americans]{.underline} (even if they are soldiers) [are equipped to
provide hope, morality, and humanity]{.underline} to the Middle East"
(767). Moreover, Debrix sees the imagination of war-borne terror as
**[essential to America's heroic narrative]{.underline}**: "An [ideology
of America at war is enabled through a visual experience that consists
of forcing the spectator's imagination not only to go through unbearable
and shocking images but also to transcend this initial painful
experience by discovering]{.underline} beyond it readily available
reasons and [**larger-than-life truths** than can make sense of it all
and **justify those horrific scenes**]{.underline} . . . [towards some
ideas that supposedly can provide solace, understanding, and ultimately
**pleasure** to the spectator]{.underline}" (771).

This ideology epitomized American conflicts waged a century before the
Iraq War's technological "shock and awe," and the view that [combat with
a]{.underline} **[savage, Orientalized enemy]{.underline}** [would "help
democracy and peace and justice rise in a troubled and violent region"
(Bush)]{.underline}. Both the Spanish-American War (1898) and the
subsequent **[Philippine-American War]{.underline}** (1899--1902) [were
technologydriven events, fought with Gatling guns, Krag-Jørgensen
rifles, steel battleships, and American soldiers]{.underline}, whom
Secretary of War Elihu Root appreciated [as part of the]{.underline}
**["great machine which we call military organization"]{.underline}**
(Simon 47). Beyond proving American ability in battle, and its
industrial strength and capacity to make war, [proponents felt these
wars were]{.underline} **[essential markers of American
modernity]{.underline}**. Theodore Roosevelt reasoned [their prosecution
was "one of the great tasks set modern civilization," bringing blessings
of American democracy to the world's backward peoples, and benefiting
the domestic sphere by inoculating white manhood against the decline of
civilization and alleviating residual sectionalism]{.underline}
(Roosevelt 11; Bederman 187; Ninkovich 18--19).

[With an ideology that combined]{.underline} **[technology, war, and
race]{.underline}** [under the banner of]{.underline} **[civilizing
imperialism]{.underline}**, [the United States entered the twentieth
century seeking a "new international identity"]{.underline} (Ninkovich
47, 91--92). New liberating technologies, like wireless transmission and
air travel, supported this identity and fostered America's transnational
connections. Yet, [technology acted as a double-edged sword, increasing
encounters with global dangers, and giving rise to a host of new worries
about American power. This included the Japanese invasion sublime, a
hybrid of the technological and war sublime, and America's agitated view
of Asians in the early twentieth century]{.underline}; this fear
exaggerated the threat of Japanese militarism and concluded that a
conquest of the United States was its ultimate goal. By envisioning
Japanese ascendency primarily through a military domination of the
Pacific, the Japanese invasion sublime operated as an early form of
techno-Orientalism. [Embedded within the sublime was]{.underline} also
**[a drive to find a Western technological solution]{.underline}** [to
the menace of Japanese military supremacy]{.underline}.

The [Russo-Japanese War was the genesis event]{.underline} because [it
introduced a modern vision of the East effectively wielding technology
against the West.]{.underline} After the war grew a suspicion that
Japan, emboldened by its victory over Russia, would strike the United
States with a Port Arthur--like sneak attack. The panic was enough to
derail the U.S. Navy's plans for a "great western base" in the
Philippines, with Japan's hard-won siege of Port Arthur still burning in
the minds of American leaders (Challener 182; Edward Miller 79).

Yet, the Japanese invasion sublime was not merely a hopeless resignation
to Japanese aggression. [Prodded by the outcome of the Russo-Japanese
War to confront the unpleasant image of Japanese hegemony, the American
military slowly constructed a path around its immobilizing
fears:]{.underline} **[War Plan Orange]{.underline}**, America's first
and most detailed official imagination of future war prior to World War
II. From its genesis in 1907, Plan Orange's many authors "never wavered
in their innermost minds" that a [complete and utter destruction of
Japan was the ultimate goal]{.underline}. Though the plan was endlessly
revised, its basic structure yielded the strategy with which the United
States triumphed in Pacific War of 1941 to 1945. Yet, no matter how
triumphantly it imagined a final victory over Japan, the Orange Plan in
each version assumed the Americans would suffer some form of
catastrophic defeat to Japan at the conflict's onset (Edward Miller,
347, 363).

The [Japanese invasion sublime, fueled by]{.underline} **[fearful
images]{.underline}** [of Japanese domination powerful enough
to]{.underline} **[undermine American security]{.underline}** and
triumphalism, **[shared the yellow peril's "kaleidoscope of
apprehensions"]{.underline}** that concurrently bedeviled the Western
mind (Richard Thompson ii; Sharp 6). Both [projected nightmarish images
of Asians and fear that "the West could be overpowered and
enveloped . . . by the forces of the East"]{.underline} (Marchetti 2).
Unique, however, is the origin of the Japanese invasion sublime in a
specific context and event. Unlike yellow peril's representation of
Asian acrimony toward the West as being ancient, occultish, immortal,
and divorced from definite grievances, [it was the]{.underline}
**[high-tech modernity]{.underline}** exhibited by Japan in the
Russo-Japanese War [that launched the Japanese invasion sublime and gave
it potency]{.underline} (Iriye 7).

Rotem Kowner contends that a "**[historiographic amnesia]{.underline}**"
[erased Western memories of the Russo-Japanese War within a few years of
its conclusion, yet the Japanese invasion sublime served as the
West's]{.underline} **[anamnestic repository]{.underline}** [for the
war---]{.underline}it was [mythologized as a prelude to a U.S.-Japanese
conflict, and exemplified as a warning of]{.underline} Japanese
[technological aggression for succeeding generations]{.underline}
(Impact 2--3). Almost immediately after Russia's defeat, a menacing,
technologically adept Japan [became the focus of yellow peril
media]{.underline}, until the end of World War II (Franklin, War Stars
36, 39).

The perception of the Russo-Japanese War as watershed moment was
[synchronous with]{.underline} the Victorian and Edwardian **[fixation
on race, gender, and national strength]{.underline}**. [As the United
States pondered its vulnerabilities, it developed an incongruous image
of Japan:]{.underline} **[technologically adept]{.underline}**, modern,
chivalrous, and civilized, **[yet savage and]{.underline}** ultimately
**[an existential threat]{.underline}** [to the West]{.underline}. This
knotty conception largely [projected anxieties over
decaying]{.underline} **[white masculinity]{.underline}**, through
nervous disorders like neurasthenia and declining birth rates, which
Roosevelt termed "race suicide" (Bederman 199--200). Such [worries
underscored "silent invasion" rhetoric about Japanese
immigrants]{.underline}; when Los Angeles's Japanese Chrysanthemum Club
began raising donations for Japan's war effort, the Los Angeles Times
accused them (and by implication all Japanese Americans) of being
clandestine soldiers disguised as gardeners: "Under this euphonious
name, which suggests quaint tea gardens, dancing Geisha girls, and
flower bedecked booths and jinrikishas, there creeps the dominant idea
of grim visaged War. . . . \[U\]ntil all the Japanese on the Pacific
Coast have been brought within its influence and placed in readiness to
respond to any call for aid from their island home" ("War Spirit in
Sweet Names" 1). Nourishing these suspicions were reports of Japanese
soldiers masquerading as Chinese peasants to elude the Russians in
Manchuria ("Plays Waiting Game" 1). Scuttlebutt that secret Japanese
armies existed on American soil awaiting instructions from Tokyo gained
traction after the war. In 1907 William Randolph Hearst's San Francisco
Examiner claimed "Japanese troops in the guise of coolies" were covertly
maneuvering throughout California (qtd. in Daniels 110). This bogey had
a surprising longevity, and suspicions of a Japanese American fifth
column undergirded the drive for internment more than three decades
later.

[Existing apprehensions of]{.underline} **[white male
deterioration]{.underline}** [coalesce]{.underline}d
[around]{.underline} the Russo-Japanese War's **[disturbing visuals of
modern war and Asian ascendency]{.underline}**, giving rise to the
Japanese invasion sublime. However, just as Roosevelt and other
imperialists believed brutal race wars could strengthen American
civilization, the sublime of an exaggerated Japanese menace might also
be "a healthy shock, a temporary dislocation of the sensibilities that
forced the observer into mental action" (Nye 6). Processed through this
perspective, Japan's [combination of technology, civilization, and
primitive savagery]{.underline} to defeat a decrepit Russia [served as a
unifying call to arms and a potential solution to perceived American
weakness]{.underline}.

### Thesis\-\--Techno-Orientalism

#### The Asian body is rendered [not as human]{.underline}, but as an [exploitable technology]{.underline}. The death of Vincent Chin is an [embodiment]{.underline} of [schizophrenic Western hatred]{.underline} that must dismantle the Oriental [factory machine]{.underline} to reclaim its [personhood]{.underline}, [subjectivity]{.underline}, and [masculinity]{.underline}.

[From the earliest era of Asian peoples in the United States, their
**technical abilities** were both]{.underline} **[lauded]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[erased]{.underline}**. An exemplar is the Chinese
men who composed more than half of the labor force that completed the
transcontinental railroad's western portion over the high Sierra Nevada
mountains to Promontory, Utah, in 1869. [In the campaign to extend the
Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the American Federation of Labor
argued]{.underline} in their publication, Some Reasons for Chinese
Exclusion, Meat vs. Rice, American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism:
Which Shall Survive? (1902[), that the Chinese male body differed
radically from the American male body]{.underline}. The publication
[argued that the Chinese laborer could withstand physical deprivations
that American and European laborers could not]{.underline} (American
Federation of Labor et al. 5, 14, 16, 18). [This constructed
difference]{.underline} **[rationalized discriminatory
policies]{.underline}** against Chinese railroad workers. Meat vs. Rice
did not argue the Chinese had particular technical skills that were
valuable for constructing the transcontinental railroad. On the
contrary, the [publication claimed the Chinese body simply did not
require the conditions of safety, sustenance, and shelter that bodies of
European descendents required]{.underline}. **[Implicit]{.underline}**
in their argument [is a threat to the superior European laborer's way of
life or culture by a kind of]{.underline} **[unfeeling superhuman
antithetical to the West's liberal humanist credo.]{.underline}**

The [U.S. techno-Orientalist imagination is thus rooted in this view of
the]{.underline} **[Asian body]{.underline}** [as a form of]{.underline}
**[expendable technology]{.underline}**---a view that emerged in the
discourse of early U.S. industrialization and continued to evolve in the
twentieth century. In 1982, a twenty-seven-year-old Chinese American
named **[Vincent Chin]{.underline}** [was beaten to death by two white
men in Detroit]{.underline}. [The attackers, Ronald Ebens and Michael
Nitz, were autoworkers in a U.S. auto industry that was losing market
share to Japanese cars]{.underline}. [Though Chin]{.underline}, a
drafter, **[did not work in automobiles]{.underline}**, [Ebens and Nitz
viewed him as representative---]{.underline}indeed, **[an
embodiment]{.underline}**---[of Japanese auto manufacturing]{.underline}
as they beat him with a baseball bat, reminiscent of Americans smashing
Japanese-made cars in reaction to increasing auto imports in the early
1980s.9 The **[callous brutality]{.underline}** [of Chin's death evinces
something]{.underline} **[more than racial hatred]{.underline}**; [Chin
not only was perceived as a convenient stand-in for the Japanese
automotive industry, but]{.underline} [**embodied its
traits**---**unfeeling, efficient, and inhuman**]{.underline}. In Ebens
and Nitz's eyes, they were Luddites striking down the automatons that
had been sent in to replace them. [Techno-Orientalist discourse
completed the project of dehumanizing Vincent Chin by rendering him as
not only a]{.underline} **[racialized Other]{.underline}**, [but
a]{.underline} **[factory machine]{.underline}** [that had to be
**dismantled**]{.underline} [by Ebens and Nitz]{.underline} **[to
reclaim their personhood]{.underline}**, **[subjectivity, and
masculinity]{.underline}**.10 The shock and outrage over Chin's murder
served as a critical rallying cry under which a coalition of
ethnic-specific groups joined as Asian Americans.

In the twenty-first century, the [perceived economic threat of Japan and
its automobiles has given way to China]{.underline}. Despite the fact
that China does not have a particularly strong reputation as a high-tech
nation, [techno-Orientalism's]{.underline} **[robust
flexibility]{.underline}** [allows for seamless transplantation to
another national site]{.underline}. China's rapid economic rise is
largely credited to its vast manufacturing base, which, coupled with
cheap labor and less regulation, has made it an attractive production
location for many tech companies, including Apple and Dell. And although
the vast majority of Chinese cannot afford the iPads and iPhones they
produce, [we see in U.S. media a representational shift, using
techno-Orientalist conventions, transforming Chinese from mindless
workers to sinister agents]{.underline}. For example, in October 2010, a
U.S. PAC called Citizens Against Government Waste uploaded a commercial
titled "Chinese Professor" on YouTube.

Set in Beijing, China a.d. 2030, the commercial depicts a male professor
lecturing in a large hall accompanied by high-tech gadgets. The lecture
consists of conservative talking points regarding the decline of the
United States. As colorful images of fallen nations scroll behind him,
the professor explains, "America tried to spend and tax itself out of a
great recession. Enormous socalled 'stimulus spending,' massive changes
to health care, government takeovers of private industries, and crushing
debt." He concludes, "Of course, we owned most of their debt, so now
they work for us." With echoes of Fu Manchu, the professor smiles
directly into the camera, eliciting his students' mirth. By presenting
the Chinese professor, the students, and the lecture as moving
seamlessly between the lecture hall technology and the tablet screens
that students hold in their laps, this video implies that China now
leads the world in technological production and consumption. The encoded
secondary message of the commercial sidesteps the reality of China's
still developing technological penetration by projecting a present-day
existential fear into a vision of the future, with technology supposedly
rooted in U.S.-based innovation. It is an elegant solution that
effectively alarms the uninformed viewer by using a panAsian
technological conflation to elide reality and implicitly accuse China of
stealing U.S. intellectual property. Thus, although the national actors
and the details are quite different from the automobile industry of the
1980s, we have a similar techno-Orientalist narrative: U.S. jobs and
manufacturing are being stolen by inorganic, technologically infused
persons who threaten not only our economic but humanistic integrity.

SF's techno-Orientalist tendencies have become so common as to merit
incisive parody. The animated series Futurama takes place a thousand
years in the future, and both skewers and pays homage to SF conventions.
In an episode from the sixth season, Futurama depicts the launch of the
new "EyePhone," a jab at Apple's handset, as a pillory of modern
consumerism. The series' white protagonist, Fry, asks a retail clerk of
South Asian descent, "you're from one of those ethnicities that knows
about technology; why is it called an EyePhone?" (Sandoval). Depicted in
the show as having an intelligence level on par with Homer Simpson, Fry
is not meant to be taken seriously, and often acts as a vessel for
twentieth-century ignorance in a progressive future. What is notable in
this exchange is how the producers of Futurama have Fry explicitly
verbalize a familiar techno-Orientalist trope---Asiatic bodies
functioning as gatekeepers, facilitators, and purveyors of technology.
In this episode, the South Asian clerk literally acts as the final node
on the assembly line that has been largely produced by robotic
arms---the clerk reaches through the drapes to pull an EyePhone from a
pile and we see mechanical limbs swinging about the factory. He is an
assembly line automaton with a human skin, and his affectless, bored
intonation belies his true nature as a machine. A less self-aware show
might leave it at that, but Fry's graceless pronouncement underscores
the techno-Orientalist trope, taking SF to task while simultaneously
paying ironic homage to the genre.

This same technologizing convention that Futurama so sharply satirizes
is found in numerous literary works, including David Mitchell's Cloud
Atlas (2004). Mitchell's six stories link together characters and
narratives spanning past, present, and distant future. Consequently,
Mitchell's novel has the unenviable task of repeatedly establishing the
framing for each separate story line. An economical method for quickly
thrusting the reader into the speculative future is to use a
technologized East Asia, as he does in the story "An Orison of
Sonmi-451." The setting of Nea So Copros, the "corpocracy" of what
appears to be a unified Korea sometime after the twenty-second century,
is where we are introduced to our enslaved narrator, Sonmi-451, a cloned
"fabricant" designed to serve in a fast-food restaurant. Mitchell paints
Korea as the setting for high technology, enforced consumption, and
excessive advertising; and his larger social critique lies in the
mirroring of the fabricants who must serve and the "purebloods" who must
constantly consume, a master-slave dialectic that relies on cannibalism,
erased from view, and technology, projected into high visibility.
Sonmi-451 eventually gains self-awareness, knowledge, and power to
create a declaration of rights for enslaved fabricants and oppressed
classes, but only after she reads the classics of Western civilization
(187, 193). Thus, Mitchell's novel reinforces both the perception of
Asia as the definitive site for technophilic and technophobic
speculations of an oppressive future and the view that only a
Western-coded subject can truly realize liberal humanism in such an
environment.

**[Digital spaces]{.underline}** [abound with]{.underline}
**[reinscribed racial tropes]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[stereotypes]{.underline}**; these are [sites in which racialization
is more likely to be reinforced than challenged]{.underline} (Nakamura,
Cybertypes 227). However, we argue that [techno-Orientalist conventions
in new media are complicated by the fact that the medium is closely
associated with Asia on several levels---as a manufacturing base, as a
source of technological innovation, and as a conduit for cultural
exports]{.underline}. In new media, [the Asian subject is perceived to
be, simultaneously, producer]{.underline} (as cheapened labor),
[designer]{.underline} (as innovators), [and fluent
consumer]{.underline} ([as subjects that are "one" with the
apparatus]{.underline}). [This has the effect of]{.underline}
**[schizophrenic significations of the techno-Orientalized
subject]{.underline}** [in the realm of new media]{.underline}---games
in particular. In 2011, for instance, Blizzard Entertainment announced
an expansion pack, called "The Mists of Pandaria," for their immensely
popular MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role playing game) World of
Warcraft. MMORPGs generally have strong roots in the fantasy and SF
genres, which grant room for characters and creatures with attributes
that often reflect racial stereotypes.11 The Asian-themed world of
Pandaria---described as "mysterious" and "ancient"---and its
high-flying, kung-fu-fighting Pandaren---warriors in a nonthreatening
form---continue in the tradition of portraying Asian culture and
subjects as exotic realms to be explored and manipulated. Within the
same game is a curious mirroring of globalization, in which first-world
gamers looking to accrue in-game capital (gold) more quickly hire
gamers---many of whom are young Chinese men---to "farm" gold, thereby
miming offline conditions in which first-world consumers gain
economically by cheapened high-tech labor. At the same time, an
acceptance of the Asian subject's reputed digital literacy brings about
a sense of wonder and even admiration of their gaming skills---the
global rankings of gamers are often dominated by Korean players, for
instance. We question, however, whether that is not another symptom of
the stereotyping of Orientalized cyborg bodies predicated on a presumed
seamlessness with technology.

#### Techno-Orientalism is [pathologizing]{.underline}, rendering Asian bodies as merely [mortal engines]{.underline} of modernity and growth, [less-than-human]{.underline} yet in need of [constant surveillance]{.underline}.

Techno-Orientalism, then, is not so much a narrow discourse marking the
posthuman cybernetic body as distinctly Asian, nor is it about the
latest bleeding-edge widget being assembled by dexterous, scarred
fingers in Guangdong, China---these are instead signifiers of a larger
project. Rather, [we trace the "techno" in techno-Orientalism to
**techne**]{.underline}, [a process instead of literal tool, for
"revealing" a technology's true presence]{.underline} (wesen)
[and]{.underline} **["enframing"]{.underline}** of [the world according
to humankind's vision]{.underline} (Heidegger 3--35). [It
is]{.underline}, in a sense, [a doubling of Orientalism, a means of
constructing and reifying an Occidentalist worldview in a more
sophisticated way]{.underline}. [Techno-Orientalism]{.underline}
accounts for---and then dismisses---[Eastern modernity as both process
and product of dehumanization, of which the West is an economic and
ontological beneficiary]{.underline}; but [should that modernity ever
transition to hypermodernity]{.underline} [(and threat), its
dehumanizing means and ends reaffirm the West's monopoly over liberal
humanism]{.underline}. The speculative narratives of textual and visual
media are the vehicles through which this disciplinary process travels.

[As the American empire wanes---or]{.underline} [**is
reconfigured**---in the West and China rises in the East, the logic of
techno-Orientalism continues to exert its influence]{.underline} over
emerging cultural productions. Recent examples abound: The 2012 remake
of the Philip K. Dick--inspired film Total Recall (1990) redesigns the
cityscape to resemble the Hong Kong skyline; Gary Shteyngart's satirical
Super Sad True Love Story (2010) envisions a future New York City placed
at the precipice of the U.S. economy's implosion and subsequent takeover
by the Chinese; Junot Diaz's postapocalyptic novel in progress, Monstro,
projects the Chinese renminbi replacing the U.S. dollar as the dominant
international currency---a phenomenon predicted by many economic
prognosticators in recent years (Cox). The film Looper's (2012)
speculative sequence was set in Shanghai to signal its futurity; Daniel
Wilson's novel Robopocalypse (2011) contains an obligatory subplot
involving a Japanese roboticist whose love for his android wife leads to
the discovery of a critical component for humanity's survival. These
works continue on a well-trodden path---[the technoOrientalized element
is]{.underline}, at times, [an alien environment]{.underline},
**[existential threat]{.underline}**, [economic competitor, or
technological bridge and always, invariably, a vehicle through which the
Western-encoded subject undertakes \[their\]]{.underline}~~his or her~~
[journey]{.underline}. Likewise, this volume has identified and
critiqued numerous examples of uncritical framing: Jason Crum's
scrutinizing of how early radio broadcasts programs underscored Asian
premodernity (Chapter 2); Victor Bascara's investigation into the
erasure of Asian bodies integral in a nineteenth-century work about the
twenty-first century (Chapter 3); Warren Liu's racialization of
temporality (Chapter 4); Abigail De Kosnik's tracing of the sublimation
of race in three techno-Orientalist films (Chapter 6); Jinny Huh's
analysis of the mixed-race imaginarium of Battlestar Galactica (Chapter
7); and Dylan Yeats's exegesis of the historical rhetoric and politics
of Orientalized enemy "bots" in video games (Chapter 9). [The West
desires Eastern machinery but resists recognizing the human toll or a
humanistic center]{.underline}.

Still, there are wrinkles and complications, particularly when
technoOrientalism is appropriated by spaces of counterdiscourse. For
instance, Korean American filmmaker and comic book author Greg Pak
exploits techno-Orientalist logic in Robot Stories (2003), an
exploration of posthumanism, race, and relationships in the guise of a
genre film. Pak's series of vignettes superficially mime
techno-Orientalist tropes---in this case, the dehumanized, machine-like
Asian laborer represented at different points by a ruthless
businesswoman, a software coder with Asperger syndrome, an android, a
disembodied consciousness---and the film proceeds to deconstruct them by
reinscribing the humanity behind each iteration. Robogeisha (2009), a
Japanese film belonging to a subgenre equal parts grotesque and camp,
takes the Western gaze to its logical conclusion. Completely self-aware
and parodic in tone, the film's loose plot centers on two orphaned
sisters who grow up to become cyborg geisha assassins, one of whom ends
up in the thrall of an evil conglomerate. The film's strongly
nationalist and absurdist denouement, in which a corporation plans the
destruction of Mt. Fuji to unite Japan against its enemies, shows how
techno-Orientalist aesthetics can be used for other ends.1 It is on this
front that additional contributors to this volume also scrutinize
deformations of techno-Orientalist discourse: Julie Ha Tran's
examination of William Gibson's fictional geographies reveals an
unexpected critical bidirectionality (Chapter 10); Kathryn Allan's
discussion of Maul and Salt Fish Girl shows how a new subgenre may
recuperate the cybernetic Asian female figure (Chapter 11); Douglas
Ishii's exposition of Joss Whedon's population of Asian artifacts and
depopulation of Asian peoples in his universe creates room for his own
critical intervention (Chapter 13); Tzarina Prater and Catherine Fung
(Chapter 14) reveal how Larissa Lai's Automaton Biographies grants Blade
Runner's Rachael a voice to "talk back" to Ridley Scott's Asian-infused
vision of dystopic Los Angeles; and media artist Nam June Paik's work,
expertly analyzed by Charles Park, operates a similar aesthetic through
which the mechanisms of human creativity and activity are fetishized and
critiqued (Chapter 15).

National and cultural authorship of the discourse notwithstanding, our
historically conscious exegesis indicates that, thus far,
[techno-Orientalism is strongly tied to]{.underline}
**[geopolitics]{.underline}**, **[economics]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[race]{.underline}**, and we see no reason to
suspect that will change. If compelled to speculate, we would first note
the material consequences of a rising consumer class in China---partly a
consequence of neoliberal trade agreements creating favorable
manufacturing conditions--- and how quickly the landscape changes in
response. In some ways, very little work is required to translate
Orientalist tropes: [the invading horde of barbarians is replaced by a
horde of robotic factory workers, kept at a distance by multinational
corporations and shipping routes]{.underline}. [They are]{.underline}
**[uncreative, less than human]{.underline}** (although complicated by
reports of poor working conditions driving some to suicide), [and always
already]{.underline} **[mechanized]{.underline}**---a narrative that
persists even in the realm of leisure, as Steve Choe and Se Young Kim
describe in their analysis of the disparity of rhetoric surrounding
Eastern as opposed to Western gamers (Chapter 8). Still, on closer
examination complications emerge, for while Japan, South Korea,
Singapore, and Taiwan were economic "miracles" of a hypercapitalist
frenzy, the strong role of the communist state cannot be ignored in
China's rise. And lest we are accused of ignoring the rest of Asia, we
note how the outsourcing of high-tech labor to South Asian nations via
information networks may also complicate a techno-Orientalist logic that
is nothing if not supple and elastic. One emerging commonality we
detect---and we are curious to see how this will be integrated into
cultural discourse that must discipline---is the role of pollution in
developing nations as manufacturing booms. Already, news reports teem
with stories of poor air quality over the largest metropolitan cities in
China, Beijing in particular. It may be that [the techno-Orientalized
subject may take on an ecocritical slant]{.underline}, as we begin to
move away from cyberspace-oriented discourse characterizing the future
as ephemeral and diaphanous; instead, it may be [polluted, riddled with
the detritus of ex-gen technology, haunted by the specter of Asian
manufacturing]{.underline} (indeed, already a hallmark of post-cyberpunk
tropes). The message conveyed by the rhetoric of "pollution" is that
[even as Asia has finally reached modernity, it does so irresponsibly,
without regard for the supposed lessons learned by the West during its
periods of rapid industrialization]{.underline} over the course of the
twentieth century. The final irony, then, is while the human toll in
Asia can be effaced from Western consciousness, environmental pollutants
traveling over wind and water currents more efficient than any shipping
route will persist, leading to inescapable, catastrophic effects on a
global scale. [Asia's major economies]{.underline}--- Japan, China,
South Korea, and India---[are, in the eyes of the West, behaving like
recalcitrant children, refusing to abide by its tutelage, insisting on
growing up too quickly, and thus warranting its **constant
surveillance**.]{.underline}

If Seo-Young Chu is correct in characterizing stereotypes as "a
technology meant to facilitate mental shortcuts" (Chapter 5), then
[techno-Orientalism has become a technology that facilitates
the]{.underline} **[containment]{.underline}** [of a perceived mass
threat]{.underline}. **["We all create images of things we fear or
glorify,"]{.underline}** writes Sander Gilman in his extended
psychoanalytic study of stereotypes. But while some of us retain the
capacity to recognize the distinction between the individual and the
stereotyped class, Gilman explains, ["\[t\]he pathological
personality]{.underline} does not develop this ability, and [sees the
entire world in terms of the rigid lines of difference. The pathological
personality's mental representation of the world supports the need for
the line of difference]{.underline}, whereas for the nonpathological
individual the stereotype is a momentary coping mechanism, one that can
be used and then discarded once anxiety is overcome. The former is
[consistently aggressive toward the real people and objects to which the
stereotypical representations correspond]{.underline}; the latter is
able to repress the aggression and deal with people as
individuals["]{.underline} (18). The prospect that such "aggressions"
will abate remains nil, however, partly because [the "individual" is by
now a quaint notion of a bygone American cultural
mythology]{.underline}, and partly due to the West's perception of Asia
as historically and persistently collectivist. Drawing on Gilman's
formulation, then, **[techno-Orientalism is a form of
pathology]{.underline}**, [necessitated by the]{.underline} **["Rising
East" rhetoric]{.underline}** [and rationalized by the neoliberal logic
of (Asian) humans as **mortal engines** of modernity and economic
growth]{.underline}. Thus, techno-Orientalist studies must be vigilantly
developed and deployed as a critical countertechnology for negotiating
the complex, taut lines of a discourse ensconced in racial and
international politics.

### Thesis\-\--Uncanny Valley

#### The Asian body becomes locked in the [uncanny valley]{.underline}, marked as [simultaneously human]{.underline} and [racially subhuman]{.underline}. Yellow life in the US is not [natural]{.underline}, but an [invasive parody]{.underline} of White liveliness.

BODY? THE PROBLEM OF ERASURE IN WESTERN VISUAL CULTURE", Thesis in

//CHC-DS 🐱‍👤

In 1970, Japanese scientist Masahiro Mori published an article on what
he coined the "uncanny valley," or his theory of human reactions to
objects that are humanistic. On the graph, the y-axis represents human
affinity while the y-axis represents the degree of realistic portrayal.
Mori explains that as things go further along the x-axis, people start
feeling a negative affinity to those objects. For example, a toy robot
will vaguely represent a human, but is not frightening because they are
not made to look realistic. The toy robot retains features that make it
undeniably inhuman. However, something like a prosthetic hand or a
corpse may bring about a feeling of unease to a healthy human being,
since they resemble something human but are not, or no longer, human.
This reaction is represented by the deep plunge at the bottom of the
graph, where the curve goes south in measurements of human affinity.7
Mori's uncanny valley is often used in android design in an autonomous
future to describe the unease that occurs when looking at objects that
mimic humanity. The response is perhaps even instinctual as androids are
a clear example of what could replace humans altogether. It is only
natural for people to ostracize that which can destroy them; therefore,
[the crux of the uncanny valley lies in the]{.underline} **[innate fear
of human mortality]{.underline}**.8 [In this vein of thought, the
uncanny valley can]{.underline} also [be applied through a **racial
context**]{.underline} [in Western societies]{.underline}, especially in
Europe and the United States. [Revealed on a **microscopic
level,**]{.underline} "[research on immigrant students of color reveals
that students undergo a process of]{.underline}
**[racialization]{.underline}** [as they are incorporated into the
existing racial hierarchy of the United States---one that places White
people at the top and defines them as the only true
Americans]{.underline}."9 Furthermore, "[participants in
both]{.underline} of our [studies internalized these notions of
Americanness, evidenced strongly in their reserving the term
[']{.mark}**American'** to refer to **White people**, while using
ethnically or racially specific language to identify themselves or other
people of color]{.underline}."10 When enlarged to a national scale and
[enforced by systematic ostracization]{.underline}, compared to the
white majority or "true Americans," [the racial Other seems
to]{.underline} **[invade the United States]{.underline}** [or exists in
it]{.underline} **[unnaturally]{.underline}** in the eyes of both
parties. Since these "Others" do not resemble the white majority, [their
existence becomes a]{.underline} **[parody of white
livelihood]{.underline}** [and their humanity comes into
question.]{.underline}

This racial division in the U.S. is further perpetrated [by]{.underline}
the [stereotypes and biases]{.underline} the white majority forces on
these Others. By creating these exaggerations, [the white majority can
control how the racial Other is portrayed]{.underline}. These
caricatures are the start of the systematic dehumanization, with
different archetypes assigned to different racial group. [With East
Asians, alienation peaked with the spread of the]{.underline} **[Yellow
Peril ideology]{.underline}**. Throughout the late 19th and the early
20th century, [mass immigration]{.underline} brought an increase of
Asian population in the United States as a direct result of Western
military and imperialistic influences on Asia. However, this influx
[brought fear that these so-called "foreigners" would disrupt or
potentially overtake the white majority]{.underline}. As a response,
British author Sax Rohmer created Fu Manchu, a crafty Chinese mastermind
plotting to overthrow the white, Eurocentric world, at the height of the
Yellow Peril. While Fu Manchu himself represented the white man's fear
of the Chinese invasion, his army of minions that carried out his orders
had traits that paralleled with what people believed of the Chinese
laborers at that time. They were seen as "'instruments'---that is, as
'exploitable, containable, and inhuman,' and as 'the perfect 'laboring
machine\[s\]'---a swarm of mindless coolies who could be easily
'programmed.'"11 [The Chinese were seen as unintelligent and robotic;
they were "beings that **appear human** and behave in human-like ways,
but that are really **subhuman on the 'inside.'**"]{.underline}12 [Yet
the white man still feels anxiety in regards to the Chinese because they
are a "contradiction between \[the\] thing\'s appearance and the essence
that one has attributed to it."]{.underline}13 To the white man, [the
Chinaman is "felt to be both human and subhuman--- and therefore as
an]{.underline} [**uncanny entity**"]{.underline}14 because he is
simultaneously both Fu Manchu and his faceless, mechanical minions.

Needless to say, Fu Manchu did [not only]{.underline} represent the
[Chinese, but the looming threat of the East and Asian bodies to white
society]{.underline}. Unsurprisingly, the character of Fu Manchu has
always been represented onscreen by a white man in costume; even his
description in Rhomer's books contained Anglo-Saxon features such as
"\[a\] brow like Shakespeare" and "shimmering green irises."15 As the
embodiment of the Yellow Peril, Rhomer created the Chinese mastermind
with intelligence and agency; to the white majority, these traits cannot
be separated from whiteness as evident in the appearance of Fu Manchu as
they are understood as human traits. Therefore, by imposing Asian
features on a white man while trying to maintain that the danger he
embodies in fact resides in the East, Rhomer created a truly uncanny and
inhuman monster as it forces his audience to think about racial
implications.16 If Fu Manchu is an intelligent mastermind, then he must
be white. But his role of representing the Yellow Peril categorizes him
as a racial Other. The racial contradiction of Fu Manchu reflects the
unease of white audience as they are confronted with the possibility of
humanity residing in the racial Other. [One of the solutions to
ameliorate this anxiety is not only by marking the Asian body as uncanny
but **destroying the Asian body altogether**]{.underline}.

### Thesis\-\--Western Imperialism

#### Antagonized by the project of [Western imperialism]{.underline}, Asian subjectivity is in a [constant state of flux]{.underline}, pushed to the [periphery]{.underline} of Empire in [nonlinear spatiotemporalities]{.underline} under modernity's [anxious securitization]{.underline}.

The ways in which [techno-Orientalism manifests in]{.underline} Asia are
predicated on Cold War logics, a kind of **[Western militarized
violence]{.underline}**. Jodi Kim (2010) finds in Ends of Empire that
[the Cold War brought **spatial and temporal distinctions for racialized
Asian bodies**]{.underline} [via proxy wars]{.underline}. [The United
States' relationship with Asian nations is overdetermined by the events
of that era]{.underline}: "The Cold War, [as a geopolitical, cultural,
and epistemological project of gendered racial formation and imperialism
undergirding U.S. global hegemony]{.underline}" (Kim, 2010, p. 4). The
United States' investment in nations like South Korea, Japan, and
Vietnam is predicated on Western interests in the geopolitical sphere.
[The United States rebuilt Japan after World War II as a means of
gaining capital and hegemonic power, which is a **neo-imperialist** and
**gendered** project that undergirds U.S.-Japan relations]{.underline}.
Okinawa is a focal point for empires to collide---Japan's settlement and
the US military occupation---both of which have brought genderbased
violence to indigenous Okinawans (Yoneyama, 2015). [The racialized,
gendered dynamic produces a taxonomy of Asian subjectivity in that
**Asians are tools for the West**. Within hegemonic systems, Asian women
are **pushed to the periphery of Empire**]{.underline}. [Their
subservience and domination are used to further]{.underline}
**[neo-colonial, white, hegemonic, masculine interests]{.underline}**,
which is [evident in the advent of comfort women and the military sex
industry]{.underline} (Yoneyama, 2015). [Western nations, specifically
white men, are invested in Asia because they perceive themselves
as]{.underline} **["saving"]{.underline}** [Asian women from an
Orientalized depiction of violent Asian men, which propagates a
racialized and heteronormative notion of Asia]{.underline} (Park, 2012).
The [political and economic rise of Asian principalities]{.underline}
such as China, Japan, and India [transform Oriental epistemologies via
a]{.underline} **[disruption of white hegemonic power]{.underline}**. In
the attempt of Asian nations to secure capital, **[security anxieties
manifest]{.underline}** [from white fears of]{.underline} emasculation
or [the loss of power]{.underline}. [In a discursive response to
maintain international white supremacy, a new form of othering
occurs]{.underline} (Park, 2012; Agathangelou, 2016).

Thus, [Cold War logics]{.underline} **[spectrally
transform]{.underline}**, **[haunt]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[underlie techno-Orientalism]{.underline}**. **[Asian subjectivity is
always within a state of flux]{.underline}** [or being and exists
in]{.underline} **[nonlinear spatiotemporalities]{.underline}** [as a
result of Western modernities]{.underline}:

the Cold War between capitalism and communism is actually a "civil war"
within the selfsame Western modernity. As Odd Arne Westad argues, both
the United States and the Soviet Union saw themselves as the successors
of Western modernity and, the Cold War was waged over which one would be
the sole rightful successor, and would thus be able to articulate its
own conception of Western modernity and attempt to universalize it.
(Kim, 2010, p. 24)

The [spectral violence that manifests in Cold War logics,
techno-Orientalism, and racial capitalism finds its origin in
**modernity itself**]{.underline}. Thus, the Cold War is [a lynchpin for
the neoliberal era]{.underline}. The [revitalization of specific Asian
nations becomes a means of]{.underline} **[securing new means of
neoliberal production]{.underline}**. [Asian countries]{.underline},
specifically in Southeast Asia, [are]{.underline} **[locked in Cold War
temporalities]{.underline}** [due to their history of colonization and
neo-colonial geopolitical relationship with the West]{.underline}.5 Yet
[within]{.underline} new [technologized nations]{.underline}, [racial
capitalism produces industries such as sweatshops and call centers,
equating Asian subjectivity with technology]{.underline} (Roh et al.,
2015).

### Advocacy\-\--Art

#### In 1956, Atsuko Tanaka donned a kimono-style garment made entirely out of colored incandescent light bulbs of different sizes and electrical cords tangled together. When displayed in galleries and exhibitions, the dress hung on its own, decorative and immobile like a sort of postmodern Christmas tree. When worn in performances, Electric Dress came to life and covered Tanaka's body from head to toe, leaving only her face and hands exposed. The effect was the fusing of technology and flesh, transforming her into a glowing symbol of post-war Japan.

#### ...By breaking away from the past, Tanaka chose to re-envision Japan as the center of modernization, rapidly changing and growing as if undisturbed by war and the horrors of recent history. Electric Dress signifies a rebirth of industry and consumerism in a country that had previously suffered. During Tanaka's performances, the complex network of pulsating lights flickered on and off; tangled wires mimicked the body's own circuitry of nerves and veins; and her hybrid body, composed of luminous techno-skin, became emblematic of the lights of a modern Asian city.

#### In Electric Dress, Tanaka looks straight ahead towards an imagined Asian future.

If a stereotype is a technology meant to facilitate mental shortcuts,
then I have been misusing this technology. More specifically, I have
been dwelling on stereotypes of yellow peril---thinking about them at
length, spending time with them, treating them as though they were more
than two-dimensional, and (unintentionally?) turning them inside out. In
doing so, I have come to wonder whether the phenomenon of the stereotype
will eventually grow obsolete. [A stereotype is a human-shaped
technology. Technologies are]{.underline} **[constantly
changing]{.underline}**, [and they are constantly changing]{.underline}
**[the way humans are shaped]{.underline}**---[as well as the ways in
which human shapes are perceived]{.underline}. (Consider technologies
such as Photoshop, cosmetic surgery, and CGI.) What would happen to
stereotypes in a world where Zao's face is universally perceived not as
uncanny but as aesthetically ideal? Moreover, what would happen to
stereotypes in a world where anthropomorphic shapes are obsolete? [Would
a posthuman world be a post-stereotype world? Or would stereotypes look
posthuman?]{.underline}

Insofar as the phenomenon of stereotyping does exist, there need to be
ethical principles guiding the conscientious employment and construction
of stereotypes. In his science fiction, Isaac Asimov famously devised
three Laws of Robotics that govern the behavior of his robot and human
characters:

1 A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a
human being to come to harm.

2 A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where
such orders would conflict with the First Law.

3 A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does
not conflict with the First or Second Laws. (485)

As a species of humanoid artifact not unlike Asimov's robots,
stereotypes can be understood in terms of the three Laws of Robotics.
Let me conclude this essay by delineating a corollary to Asimov's laws,
namely, three Laws of Stereotypes:

1 A stereotype must not (be constructed or employed to) injure a human
being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. For
instance, the technology of stereotyping may be employed, mindfully and
helpfully, to describe a single facet of an individual person, but a
stereotype must never be employed to reduce any individual person to a
grotesque racial caricature.

2 A stereotype must (be constructed or employed to) comply with the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

3 [Humans who find themselves harmed by uncanny stereotypes have an
obligation to protect themselves from such harm]{.underline} (as long as
such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws).

This last obligation can be [fulfilled]{.underline} in a number of ways,

I look to this image to theorize how this [performance of Asian
futurity]{.underline} **[breaks away]{.underline}** [from the
techno-Orientalist stereotypes]{.underline} present in contemporary art
and performance, as well as in science fiction literature and film.
[Techno-Orientalism]{.underline} imagines Asia as a futuristic dystopia.
It [dehumanizes Asian people by presenting them as robot-like
technological objects]{.underline} in order [to]{.underline} **[ease
Western anxieties]{.underline}** [about being surpassed by the rise of
Asia]{.underline}. [This paranoid imagination places a]{.underline}
**[Western protagonist]{.underline}**, often as the figure of the space
cowboy, **[at the center of the narrative]{.underline}** [and relegates
Asian subjects to the background. As machines, they are]{.underline}
**[suspended between life and death]{.underline}**, [marked as both
super-human and sub-human, unable to materialize as
fully-formed]{.underline}. [The Western protagonist must exhibit his
superiority over technology]{.underline} ([and]{.underline} over
[race]{.underline}) [through]{.underline} **[exploitation and
control]{.underline}**. These techno-Orientalist stereotypes make their
way into popular narratives, from Blade Runner to Cloud Atlas. More
recently, these tropes appear in the third season of Westworld, where
scenes set in a futuristic version of Los Angeles were filmed in
different locations across Singapore. This suggests **[that the future
will be Asian, but the heroes will never be]{.underline}**.

[Asian futurism]{.underline}, on the other hand, [recasts these
technology-driven visions of the future to create]{.underline}
**[speculative worlds]{.underline}** [in which Asian thinkers and
artists are not exoticized as Oriental others. Instead]{.underline} they
are **[at the center of narratives]{.underline}** [rather than dotting
the margins]{.underline}. [Asian futurism asks not how future imaginings
of Asia and Asian identity are built from the West looking East, but
instead, how they emerge from the East looking forward]{.underline}.

In this preoccupation with imagining a hypothetical future, [we have to
re-orient ourselves to see how we are situated in the present and ask
the question "Where do we go from here?"]{.underline} While contemporary
artists attempt to rework tropes of techno-Orientalism and reposition
Asia in the future, [we]{.underline} **[question our own position in the
present]{.underline}** [and begin to feel even more disconnected from
the past]{.underline}. There is a gap between this abstract futuristic
conception of Asia, the actual experiences of Asians today, and those of
our predecessors.

Where, and When, Do We Go From Here?

I return again to the image of Tanaka in Electric Dress to develop my
own theory on [Asian futurity]{.underline} as that which
[is]{.underline} **[inseparable from history]{.underline}**. The
presence of Tanaka's human body in her 1956 performance of Electric
Dress evoked a feeling of horror rooted in historical memory that
resonates with both the audience and the performer in a way that the
lone object cannot. Audience members worried about the amount of heat
that emanated from the incandescent bulbs and feared that the dress
would electrocute her. In a postwar context, the excessive light
covering her body becomes reminiscent of the light of the atomic bombs
and their devastating technological power. Tanaka even confessed to
having a fleeting thought of death by electrocution when she flipped the
switch on the console and turned the power on: "Is this how a death-row
inmate would feel?" The [fear and anxiety that came along
with]{.underline} this [sense of hope, of looking forward, suggest how
intertwined the past, the present, and the future are]{.underline}.
[While we speak about Asia in the future tense, the past still tightly
grips our social reality in the present]{.underline}.

[We live in a moment where]{.underline} minimalism, or rather a kind of
**[affective minimalism]{.underline}**, [is a virtue, deeply informing
our lives and the ways that we build our archives looking
forward]{.underline}; we are told by tidying expert Marie Kondo to only
keep items that we have sentimental relationships with and discard items
that no longer "spark joy." [In looking to the past, we might find more
moments of sadness and confusion than of joy --- memories that we would
rather suppress and forget but that deeply inform our present moment
nonetheless.]{.underline} The Chinese sociologist Fei Xiaotong noted the
following upon visiting the United States in 1944: "American children
hear no stories about ghosts. They spend a dime at the drugstore to buy
a Superman comic book...Superman represents actual capabilities or
future potential, while ghosts symbolize belief in and reverence for the
accumulated past.\" Despite being born and raised in the United States,
I never cared much for superheroes, but I very much believe in ghosts.
As I continuously ask myself "What now?" and "What next?" I find myself
being drawn into the past and realizing that [the "actual capabilities
or future potential"]{.underline} that Fei saw in Superman [might be
found]{.underline} instead [within and through ghosts, through
history]{.underline}.

Performances of Asian futurism are still primarily responding to place,
imagining alternate realities through constructing or subverting images
of landscapes like the hyper-technological Asian metropolis that Tanaka
embodies in Electric Dress. When futurity is linked to place and not the
lives of the people who inhabit those places, I fail to envision myself
in it. Dawn Chan writes, "...[the **Asian American experience**
continues to grapple with the]{.underline} **[unease]{.underline}**
[that comes with]{.underline} **[sitelessness]{.underline}** [and the
ongoing threat of encountering the phrase **go home**]{.underline}."
[The Asian American experience, in this sense, is]{.underline} **[lost
in time as well as in space]{.underline}**.

I have never lived or spent much time in Asia, and my status as an
American citizen is one that is constantly being contested. I have never
been able to locate myself anywhere within Asia nor within the United
States, so I identify with [the term Asian American]{.underline} because
it [encompasses everywhere and nowhere simultaneously]{.underline}.
While my identification with the term in the present is one of
ambivalence, I look through the lens of history and recognize how the
term emerged not from one particular place but from a collective
movement --- the Black Power Movement. It is therefore necessary to
parse through our vastly different experiences as racial minorities in
order to recognize rather than to equate oppressions in Asian
racialization's relationship to white supremacy and anti-blackness.

Attention to intersectionality in approaching [multiply-marginalized
identities]{.underline} is not divisive but conducive to kinship. This
multiplicity is irreducible and [cannot be situated within one specific
place or one particular time]{.underline}. The [divisions between
then/now, and here/there, highlighted by Asian futurism become **blurred
by movement**]{.underline}.

An alternative approach to performing Asian futurity, I believe, relies
on an acknowledgement of history and of multiplicity to build
interracial solidarity with attention to the specificity of
racialization. Asian futurism, after all, draws inspiration from
Afrofuturism, yet there has been very little discourse amongst and
between the two futuristic imaginings. David Xu Borgonjon suggests that
if there's a place for art that reflects the concrete experiences of
Asians today, "it must be collective in process, focused on action, and
oriented to the margins." This art [asks not only how we can develop a
theoretical futurism but emphasizes how we can utilize that theory to
act in envisioning a real future for real people. An]{.underline}
**[orientation towards the margins]{.underline}** [allows us
to]{.underline} **[decenter whiteness]{.underline}** [and consider
multiply-marginalized identities in relation to each other rather than
to whiteness alone]{.underline}.

In order to look to a future where we can really see ourselves, we need
to look backwards. [A theory of Asian futurity can only work towards
more generative ends through an]{.underline} **[acknowledgment of
history]{.underline}** and of multiplicity, [looking not at where we are
situated but how we move together]{.underline}.

Science Fiction Translation as Cognitive Estrangement,"
<https://muse.jhu.edu/article/805954>; accessed 7/23/2022) ng \*SF =
science fiction

At this juncture then, wherein the question that demands addressing
becomes what, exactly, might be at stake in thinking of translation as a
technique of cognitive estrangement? To speak this point, let me turn to
another text, Kawamata Chiaki's Death Sentences, which also offers a
meta-science-fictional exploration that parallels Aramaki's project in
many respects, albeit with more explicit historical commentary that
facilitates a more cogent discussion of the politics of New Wave SF in
Japan, and the stakes of its subsequent translation. Like Aramaki,
Kawamata made his literary debut in the 1970s and also quickly became
involved in SF criticism. While Kawamata is perhaps more well known for
his space opera and military SF writings in more recent years, his novel
Death Sentences is an exception, veering closer to a kind of
post-New-Wave meta-SF work. The story of Death Sentences revolves around
the discovery of a set of surrealist poems by an enigmatic
French-Chinese man named only "Who May" (Hu Mei), whose writings
seemingly have the deadly power to transport their readers across space,
time, and human consciousness. The text of the novel is divided into
three major sections. One part of the novel tells the story of the
origin of the poems in an encounter between Who May and French
surrealist author Andre Breton in New York during the 1930s, subsequent
to which Breton and several other figures in the surrealist movement die
(often by suicide) one after another. Another section covers the period
when Who May's lost manuscripts resurface in 1980s Japan following their
discovery and publication amid a series of mysterious deaths among the
translators and publishing staff. The final section details the
aftermath of the mass circulation of Who May's poems, which have
developed a cult following in Japan (and subsequently, the rest of the
world), leading to the formation of a Secret Police unit that hunts down
and executes those identified as afflicted with the addictive powers of
these poems. In the end, the alternate history created by the discovery
of Who May's writings culminates in a vision of a dystopian future
wherein resource depletion has led to the settlement of Mars. There, a
Martian Guard serves as a private death squad that enforces productivity
and ensures corporate profits, even when it involves the extermination
of whole communities of colonists who have come into contact with the
poems in question. Like Aramaki's The Sacred Era, Kawamata's Death
Sentences is, strictly speaking, less an SF text per se than it is a
novel that is metafictionally about the SF genre, despite the fact that
Kawamata's novel received the 1984 Japanese SF Grand Prize (Nihon SF
Taishō). For one thing, with the exception of the final section
featuring the Martian Guard acting within a dystopic future scenario,
much of its narrative is resolutely low-tech with little attention to
issues of technological change that are typical in the genre. For
another, its primary plot conceits---specifically, the addictive and
almost narcotic quality of the magic poems of Who May, or the travels
across space and time that these same poems make possible at the end of
the novel---are given barely any attempt (even at the level of techno-
babble) at a rational or scientific explanation. That said, regardless
of whether or not one includes the text within the category of SF, what
is perhaps more interesting about Death Sentences is how its narrative
effectively presents a theory and critical account of science fiction as
a genre and broader cultural formation. In other words, if Death
Sentences is indeed an SF text, it is because the novel is precisely
about SF itself. This manifests most visibly in scenes that comment on
the history and intellectual genealogy of the SF genre. For example, at
one point in the novel, Andre Breton and David Hare--- both major
figures within the Surrealist movement--- discuss a poem of Who May's
titled "Another World." In their conversation, Hare suggests to Breton
that perhaps it would be more apt for the poem to appear in an SF
magazine instead of their surrealist publication. "I would wait another
fifteen years and bring it out in a science fiction magazine." "What!
Fifteen years?" To his dismay, Breton hadn't the slightest idea what
Hare was trying to say. "Science fiction?" "Today, it isn't feasible.
Readers haven't matured enough yet. There are some, but this is too
avant-garde. This fantasy world called 'another world' is quite
attractive. It is truly beautiful. It is full of an otherworldly sense
of wonder. Unfortunately, however, it doesn't have a principal hero or
heroine. Moreover, the vocabulary is too specialized. The absence of a
hero is a fatal flaw in this genre. At least the editors who currently
work in this genre in America think so . . . but in another fifteen
years or so . . ."20 At first glance, Hare's declaration seems to imply
a stark demarcation between SF and surrealism. Indeed, he explicitly
states that he "doesn't see any connection between this 'Another World'
and surrealism."21 Whereas surrealism operates on the principle of
"imagination aims to become reality," Who May's poems (and, by
implication, SF) are an attempt to "leave reality behind, or to
otherwise obliterate it completely."22 However, Hare's declaration is
subsequently undercut by Breton's unspoken parenthetical comment of
"Dogma!," which hints at not only his disagreement with Hare's
diagnosis, but also Hare's own seeming hesitation and anxiety with his
pronouncements.23 In the end, what this exchange between Hare and Breton
highlights is the hypothesis that SF may very well be understood as
genre that operates under parallel principles to that of surrealism.
Indeed, the end of the subsequent chapter only further underscores this
kinship between them when, in the aftermath of the end of the Second
World War, several surrealist artists and authors die in quick
succession following some form of contact with Who May's poems. The last
name the novel includes in this series is the influential SF author
Philip K. Dick. To assert an alliance between surrealism and SF is not
an altogether novel move to make. As early as 1976, critic David
Ketterer already pointed out "the considerable affinity which exists
between surrealism and SF."24 In particular, Ketterer notes the
similarities in their respective projects of expanding and transforming
the conception of the real by way of procedures of defamiliarization.
Put another way, surrealism arguably operates on a principle that
parallels Darko Suvin's pioneering conceptualization of SF as a
"literary genre whose necessary and sufficient conditions are the
presence and interaction of estrangement and cognition."25 Indeed, given
Suvin's own alignment of SF with the radical politics of utopian
imagination, one could perhaps be forgiven for suspecting that his
conception of the genre might owe a debt to ideas drawn from the
revolutionary politics of Breton's surrealist manifestos and the broader
surrealist movement's collective attempt to imagine an idealized world
in the spaces of the impossible, that is, in the literalized no-place of
utopia.26 With Kawamata's novel though, what is interesting is how it
takes this purported alliance between surrealism and SF as a point of
departure from which to launch into an exploration of the failure of
their utopian politics. The scenes subsequent to Breton's encounter with
Who May describe the sense of impasse within the surrealist movement
after the end of the Second World War, with Breton lamenting its
"terrible reality" with the words "the birth of the atomic bomb cast a
cloud over humanity, darkening the end of the Great War. . . . His
former comrades had split into various factions, some hostile and some
friendly."27 Put simply, the tenor of this sequence is less one of
revolutionary hope and more one of disappointment over the failure of
revolution. As if to punctuate this sense of failure further, once the
novel shifts to the events of 1980s Japan when Who May's poems
resurface, there is a clear suggestion that the once lofty ambitions of
the surrealist movement have since been domesticated, reduced to little
more than a brand label for a cultural commodity. Sakakibara, the
focalizing character in this section of the novel, first comes into
contact with Who May's poetry when his small publishing company is
contracted by the Seito Group, a corporate department store chain, to
assist them in one of their "cultural ventures," namely the translation
and preparation for publication of a recently discovered collection of
unpublished surrealist manuscripts and artwork. The goal of this project
is, in the words of the novel, "to draw on the vitality of these
previously unknown materials, tapping into them as a new source for
fashions and lifestyles."28 The implication here is that not only has
surrealism (and its renewal and revival) taken on a signaling function
indicative of the possession of cultural capital, perhaps more
fundamentally, its utopian potentiality had become little more than a
set of empty gestures, a set of recognizable tropes and aesthetic
techniques ready to be commercially repurposed. This takes on greater
significance in light of the novel's attempt to posit an affinity
between surrealism and SF, for what is SF if not precisely the
massmarket codification of the utopian project into the set of
iconographies and plot formulae that constitute a genre's megatext? With
this in mind, if indeed Death Sentences can be apprehended as a kind of
meta-SF text that speaks to the genre's historical genealogy and
political charge, then it would appear that what it brings to the
foreground are precisely the limits of SF as a site of radical critical
practice. Specifically, it stages what Tom Moylan has identified as an
important historical turn toward the dystopian within the genre of SF
during the 1980s in the face of economic restructuring and the
resurgence of right- wing politics. For Moylan, this dystopian turn
should not be read as simply the negation of utopia, but rather a
refashioning of the utopian impulse in the face of its new historical
conditions---what has since gone by such names as postmodernity,
globalization, and neoliberalism---which are characterized precisely by
the dominance of a broader anti- utopian sentiment. In his words: In the
face of a powerful anti-utopian campaign, dystopia's potential for
exploring utopian possibilities . . . confronted the devaluation of
Utopia by an official neoliberal discourse that proclaimed the end of
history and celebrated simultaneously the end of radical social dreaming
. . . These works carry out an intertextual intervention that negates
the 1980s negation of the critical utopian moment and thus makes room
for a new expression of the utopian imagination.29 Put simply, the
critical dystopian writings appearing since the 1980s have attempted to
address the question of the politics of SF after the end of futurity.
While Death Sentences certainly stages these questions, it cannot be
said to offer an unambiguous solution to the problem. Its finale
presents a vision of a dystopic future of a Martian colony policed with
private military contractors whose primary function is the deployment of
violence to ensure the smooth flow of the circulation of capital. As the
text puts it: "The raison d'être of the Martian Guard lay in maintaining
this felicitous relation between supply and demand, and, if possible,
enhancing it. In a word, it was a matter of population adjustment
through extermination."30 On the one hand, these scenes present a vision
of the world that anticipates the disaster capitalism of the present
conjuncture marked by the use of preemptive violence as a mechanism of
capital accumulation. Yet on the other hand, the only way out of this
world it offers is through a deus ex machina in the form of time travel
that allows for a return to the past to ensure that Who May never writes
his killer poems such that this world presumably never comes to pass. On
its face, this appears like less of an attempt at articulating a site, a
struggle, and more of a retreat, a nostalgic lament. In this respect, it
provokes a reminder of Fredric Jameson's claim that in the present
conjuncture, "the deepest vocation \[of SF\] is over and over again to
demonstrate and to dramatize our incapacity to imagine the future, to
body forth, through apparently full representation, which prove on
closer inspection to be structurally and constitutively impoverished."31
But there is also more to it than just that, for in undoing the writing
of the poems and changing the subsequent course of history, it renders
the text of the novel into a document of a history that never came to
pass. In effect, it leaves the reader with the memory of a history that
never happened. [Could the SF genre in its totality be thought of as an
archive of such unrealized histories and futurities]{.underline}? After
all, it provides [a record of what Ernst Bloch has called the "cultural
surplus" of utopian desire, unrealized futurities that exist as
potentialities but do not materialize in actuality]{.underline}.32 This
record **[serves as a reminder of the existence of different horizons of
possibility, different horizons of futurity whose affective potential
may not be already exhausted or rendered inert in the actualization of
history]{.underline}**. Viewed in these terms, the practice of
[translation turns out to be a potential technology for activating a
desire for these yet unknown and unrealized utopias]{.underline}. If,
indeed, as Lawrence Venuti has suggested, translation [offers the
potential to draw attention to historical difference]{.underline}, then
perhaps [it is not too much of a stretch to approach translation in
science-fictional terms as a kind of time-travel.]{.underline}33 It
operates, as Takayuki Tatsumi once put it in another context, as a
"[soft time machine" that facilitates "a creative dialogue between two
decades and two cultures]{.underline}."34 In doing so, **[it cannot help
but also participate in the modes of ideological
interrogation]{.underline}** [that the time travel narrative is known
for, be it in the form of, to use the terminology of William Burling,
the "**temporal dislocation**" that focuses largely on the mechanics of
time travel and the paradoxes it generates, or the "**temporal
contrast**" that places its attention on the differences between two
time periods and worlds]{.underline}.35 In Burling's view, the essential
issue at the heart of time travel stories is not their specific manifest
contents (the various past and future worlds these texts visit in their
narratives) but the very fact of time travel stories, the more
fundamental question of "Why are there so many time travel stories?"
(italics in original).36 For Burling, this proliferation is indicative
of a lack in the present, and a desire to do something about it. When it
is framed in these terms, the surge in interest in translated SF in more
recent years, amply documented by Rachel Cordasco through her website
"Speculative Fiction in Translation," might be understood
symptomatically as themselves science-fictional eruptions of this latent
sense of lack, and with it a concomitant desire for something other than
the here and now.37 But [to fully realize this potential will entail
taking seriously SFs from other languages and locations as proper sites
of extrapolative potentiality and not mere predictable
possibility]{.underline}. In other words, [if they are to become a space
for the imagination of a radical futurity that can break open the
historical limits of the present]{.underline}, [other SFs cannot be
reduced to mere extensions of an already fixed conception of the form,
to little more peripheral traditions derivative of the center in line
with more Eurocentric diffusionist models of world
literature.]{.underline}38 Instead, **[they must be encountered in
properly science-fictional terms as potential spaces for transformative
difference, as sites for the cognitive estrangement of our understanding
of the history of the genre itself.]{.underline}**

In this essay, we show how **[the Asian gamer]{.underline}** [may be
understood within the]{.underline} **[discursive powers of
techno-Orientalism]{.underline}** [that make the Asian
Other]{.underline} **[knowable and controllable]{.underline}**. [This

gamer ruptures]{.underline}** precisely **[these
fantasies]{.underline}**---of never working while video gaming
constantly, and [of eternal life without death]{.underline}. In order to
put forward this argument, we will look closely at the popular sci-fi
RTS game StarCraft, released in 1998, and the cultural trends
surrounding it. Our reading of StarCraft gestures toward attitudes
around video gaming that do not celebrate playing without end, while
**[challenging]{.underline}** [the **sacredness of life**

The first reported instance of online gamer death in Asia was in October
2002, when twenty-four-year-old Kim Kyung-jae played nonstop for
eightysix hours until he collapsed and died in an Internet café in
Kwangju, South Korea (Gluck). Just ten days later, Lien Wen-cheng died
in a café in Fengyuan, Taiwan. The twenty-seven-year-old had been
playing for thirty-two hours straight; he was found in the restroom
bleeding from the nose and foaming at the mouth (Farrell). On August 5,
2005, Lee Seungseob went into cardiac arrest following a fifty-hour
marathon session of StarCraft in Taegu, South Korea (Zimbardo).
According to the psychiatrist at the hospital where Lee was taken, he
had neglected to eat and sleep while playing. In 2005, Xinhua Online
reported that a young woman, identified only as "Snowly," died after
playing World of Warcraft "for several continuous days during the
national day holiday." An online, in-game funeral was held in her memory
by fellow gamers ("Death of Net Addict"). A twenty-six-year-old man
identified only by his surname "Zhang" died in the Liaoning province of
China on February 24, 2007. During the Spring Festival, Zhang had spent
most of the seven-day holiday playing online computer games (Yong Wu).
Also in 2007, a thirty-year-old man died of exhaustion after gaming for
three days straight in Guangzhou, China ("Chinese Man Drops Dead"). On
December 27, 2010, a nineteen-yearold college student, identified by his
surname "Moon," collapsed in a café in Ulsan, South Korea, after playing
first-person shooter (FPS) games for twelve hours (Cho). A
thirty-year-old man died in a cybercafé outside of Beijing, China, on
February 22, 2011, after playing online games for three days (Goswami).

A [Kotaku article from 2007 opens with the headline "Another Chinese Man
Dies from Gaming" and comments on this]{.underline} **[proliferation of
gamer death]{.underline}** [in Asia]{.underline}. Referring to the
player from Guangzhou, journalist Mike Fahey begins with a glib
suggestion: "Someone really needs to tell the people in East Asian
countries to stop gaming before they die." He wryly notes, "Watching a
person die from lack of common sense always makes me thirsty," and
proposes "a free latte policy" to encourage gamers to stop playing.
Fahey then concludes, ["I know the loss of a human life is not a
laughing matter, but I just cannot fathom gaming to death]{.underline}.
Back in 2001, there were weeks when I would spend every waking hour
playing EQ, but I at least took chair naps and tried my very best not to
die. Worked for me. \*sigh\*["]{.underline} [(Fahey)]{.underline}.
[Fahey characterizes Asian gamers as]{.underline}
**[obsessive]{.underline}**, **[easily manipulated]{.underline}**, [and
lacking in]{.underline} "**[common sense]{.underline}**," while his own
gaming experience worked for him. His [position of healthy self-control
draws a hard line between himself and the **inferior Other**, allowing
the Western journalist]{.underline}, as Edward Said writes, ["a whole
series of possible relationships with the Orient without ever losing him
the relative upper hand"]{.underline} (7). **[Reinstating the difference
between reality and simulation]{.underline}**, [Fahey knows that he must
not lose himself to the game]{.underline}. [But the]{.underline}
**[assertion of difference betrays anxieties]{.underline}** [around the
fantasy of excessive gaming and the]{.underline} **[fine line between
excessive fun and death]{.underline}**, [anxieties]{.underline} that are
[quickly projected back onto the seemingly less grievable
other]{.underline}. [The Asian gamer dies because of his immaturity and
inability to moderate his own pleasures. Meanwhile, Fahey]{.underline}

### Advocacy\-\--Cyborg Politics

#### Thus, we endorse [cyborg politics]{.underline}, the [illegitimate offspring]{.underline} of militarism and capitalism that embraces [illegibility]{.underline} in the metaphoric [Asian American cyborg]{.underline}. By expressing the [lived modes of racialized bodies]{.underline}, we [reframe politics]{.underline} towards new [affective connections]{.underline} that subvert systemic violence.

A particularly salient feature of Haraway's cyborg politics is its
Althusserian ethos to recognize the mythology of identity from both
sides of the ideological coin: myth-making on the part of the
nation-state as grand narratives as well as myth-making on the part of
the individual in how we desire to be hailed within those grand
narratives. In her manifesto, she states: "The [boundary is permeable
between tool and myth, instrument and concept, historical systems of
social relations and historical anatomies of possible bodies,
including]{.underline} **[objects of knowledge]{.underline}**. Indeed,
[myth and tool mutually constitute each other]{.underline}." (Haraway
165) In order to deploy critical studies as the "tool" by which we seek
sociopolitical equity, Haraway asserts that [we are inseparable from the
"historical systems of social relations" that we seek to
recalibrate]{.underline}. **[Cyborg politics]{.underline}** does not
allow hegemonic constructs to be wholly responsible for the obstructions
to a more just and equitable society. Rather, it [demands that we fully
acknowledge how all participate in the coalescing of power]{.underline}:
"**[Innocence]{.underline}**, and the corollary insistence on victimhood
as the only ground for insight, **[has done enough
damage.]{.underline}**" (Haraway 158) Even the disenfranchised
constitute the organization of hegemony ! if that were not so,
centralized power could not exist. In other words, Asian American
subjectivity is just as much constructed by Asian Americans in that we
are also participating in the racialization of the Asian American body.
If the nation-state has historically sought to corporealize the Asian
American body in order to disenfranchise it from dominant white culture,
striving to substantiate the racialized Asian American body does not
mitigate the centralizing power of dominant white culture.

Kandice Chuh addresses the paradox of identity and ideology in that [the
Asian American body is just as effectively decorporealized in the name
of the abstracted universal citizen as it is celebrated in national
multiculturalism]{.underline}. [Yet]{.underline}, she points out, [the
nation-state]{.underline} ultimately [remains firmly invested in the
ideology of a subject in that]{.underline} "[As the uniquely authorized
discourse of the nation,]{.underline} and in contrast to the postulation
of the modern are that subjects (to monarchal power) have transformed
into consensual citizens (of a nation-state), [law requires subjection/
subjectification]{.underline}. \[my emphases\]." (Chuh 10) Subsequently,
what Chuh proposes is an Asian American "subjectless" discourse. In line
with Haraway's idea of transgressing the boundary between myth and
reality, [Chuh proposes that we recognize the mythology that surrounds
the Asian American subject as]{.underline} **[constructed]{.underline}**
[by the U.S. nation-state]{.underline}. Moreover, Chuh aks us to
recognize our own mythmaking participation in the construction of this
Asian American subject: "Recognition of the subject as epistemological
object cautions against failing endlessly to put into question both
"Asian American" as the subject/ object of Asian Americanist discourse
and of U.S. nationalist ideology, and Asian American studies as the
subject/ object of dominant paradigms of the U.S. university. (Chuh 10)

Chuh argues for an approach to Asian American studies as subjectless in
order to sidestep the trap of wondering who constitutes being
"authentically" Asian American. Recalling the controversy over Lois Ann
Yamanaka's Blu's Hanging for its award for Best Fiction by the
Association for Asian American Studies, Chuh observes how the incident
limns the contested grounds for who, what and how the term "Asian
American" is constituted. Stepping back and recognizing this contested
ground reveals how much [the Asian American subject is inadvertently
redefined within the rubrics of U.S. nation state
ideologies]{.underline}. Chuh proposes that we refocus from
representation and to the investigation of the unjust material
conditions associated with the racialized Asian American body:

If we accept a priori that Asian American studies is subjectless, then
rather than looking to complete the category "Asian American," to
actualize it by such methods as enumerating various components of
differences (gender, class, sexuality, religion, and so on), we are
positioned to critique the effects of the various configurations of
power and knowledge through which the term comes to have meaning.
Thinking in terms of subjectlessness does not occlude the possibility of
political action. Rather, it augurs a redefinition of the political, an
investigation into what "justice" might mean and what (whose) "justice"
is being pursued. (Chuh 10-11)

Haraway's **[cyborg politics]{.underline}** [contributes]{.underline} to
Asian American literary studies [by formulating a language that is
both]{.underline} **[self-reflexive]{.underline}** [of its complicity
with hegemonic power and at once]{.underline}
**[resistive]{.underline}** [of that complicity in]{.underline}
**[productive ways]{.underline}**. Although Asian Americans identify
with and are identified via racializing modes of nation-state
technologies, [it is the material conditions that surround such bodies
that we can focus on]{.underline}. [Acknowledging that the cyborg is
the]{.underline} [offspring of hegemonic power]{.underline}, then, [is
precisely what imparts its power to]{.underline} **[subvert that
system]{.underline}**: "The main trouble with [cyborgs]{.underline}, of
course, is that they [are the]{.underline} **[illegitimate offspring of
militarism and patriarchal capitalism]{.underline}**, not to mention
state socialism. But [illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly
unfaithful to their origins]{.underline}." (Haraway 152) Haraway
encourages us to **[embrace illegitimacy]{.underline}**, to [abandon
notions of authenticity and origin, in order to]{.underline}
**[challenge the authority]{.underline}** [of nation-state grand
narratives]{.underline}. [By approaching Asian American subjectivity as
a myth]{.underline}, parented by both the U.S. nation-state as well as
Asian American racialized bodies themselves, [we may re- imagine
an]{.underline} **[entirely new creature]{.underline}**, one I'd like to
offer is **[the Asian American transnational as metaphoric
cyborg]{.underline}**.

[If the cyborg is all about]{.underline} **[transgressing
boundaries]{.underline}**, [the Asian American transnational
demonstrates the]{.underline} material and **[lived modes]{.underline}**
[by which the racialized body transgresses boundaries every
day]{.underline}. By transgressing national boundaries, the Asian
American transnational body [reveals how so many other hegemonic
ideologies are deeply imbricated into the notion of national
identity]{.underline}. In Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's Dictee, Cha
illustrates the tortured boundaries over which nation-state apparatuses
colonize what we might arbitrarily label the Korean American body.
Revealing the permeability between the myth of the "Korean American"
label and the tools needed to recognize the lived realities of those
labeled, Dictee defies any sedimentation of representative identity at
every angle possible. Cha challenges her readers to strive to recognize
her Korean American identity through the wreckage of elided history and
multiply-colonizing technologies if only to prove that indeed no such
identity can be recognized. At every turn, she crosses the line between
what is myth and what is "real" precisely in order to limn that very
line.

Read **[through the lens of cyborg politics]{.underline}**, [it is
this]{.underline} **[crossing between myth and reality]{.underline}**
[that highlights the hegemonic machinations that work to sustain systems
of centralized power]{.underline}. Cha's text is all about revealing
myth in order to highlight both how powerful the tools of the state are
as well as [to sharpen the critical tools we seek to deploy]{.underline}
in the name of justice. Three key mythologies in Dictee will be examined
in this chapter: the myth of natural language, the myth of historical
veracity, and the myth of the coherent subject. In the midst of all
these myths, what is consistent throughout Cha's text is the insistence
on the very real presence of a body. Cha never lets her reader forget
that although she tears down every other façade of a coherent subject
possible, somewhere, there is always a body involved. Without a body,
the technologies of nationstate apparatuses would be inert. With a
Korean American transnational body, Cha deploys the tool of the
affective body in order to underscore the various mythologies that seek
to undermine and colonize that body.

By **[the affective body]{.underline}**, I mean one that [remains firmly
linked to its material conditions but]{.underline}
**[delinked]{.underline}** [from its grand narratives and
over-determined image-based representation]{.underline}. [Relying on
the]{.underline} **[body as fulcrum]{.underline}** [to Asian American
identity politics will be a nuanced critical task]{.underline}. Chuh's
subjectless discourse demonstrates how we can move away from a
representational politics of the image and [towards a politics
of]{.underline} **[indeterminate identity]{.underline}**. The concern
with indeterminacy is its power to dissolve materiality in a sea of
endless difference. Haraway addresses this concern when she states: "But
in the consciousness of our failures, we risk lapsing into boundless
difference and giving up on the confusing task of making partial, real
connection. Some differences are playful; some are poles of world
historical systems of domination. 'Epistemology' is about knowing the
difference." (Haraway 161-2) Dictee seizes Asian American critical
literary attention in that it is at once an aesthetically
ground-breaking text as well as one that remains intensely focused on
the Korean American body. Cha accomplishes what Haraway suggests: Cha
demolishes the binary and opts for the nebulous grainy terrain of
difference. Nevertheless, Dictee never departs from the task of making
partial, real connections through what I critically deploy as affect.

In Parables of the Virtual, Brian Massumi disagrees with Fredric
Jameson's pronouncement that a key feature of the postmodern age is a
"waning of affect" (Massumi 27). Massumi argues that "If anything,
[our]{.underline} \[**[postmodern]{.underline}**\]
**[condition]{.underline}** [is characterized by a **surfeit
of**]{.underline} \[**[affect]{.underline}**\]." (ibid) Massumi's main
point here is that [affect is]{.underline} indeed [a tool critical
studies should utilize in order to shed better light on the paradox of
the postmodern condition]{.underline}. Posited in the tension between
Jameson's "death of the subject" (Jameson 5) and Massumi's "surfeit of
affect", Dictee searches for a subject in a surfeit of affect. However,
Cha never seeks to resuscitate the liberal humanist subject back to
life. Instead, Cha's text affectively conveys the specific struggle to
seek subjectivity. Formalistically, although the textuality of Dictee is
a postmodern landscape, it is an intensity of affect that defines Cha's
exploration of what is myth and what is real in the realm of identity.
Coupling intensity to affect, Massumi proposes that [**critical light**
emerges in the movement of an expression-event]{.underline} such as
Dictee:

[Much could be gained by integrating the dimension of intensity into
cultural theory]{.underline}. .... It is [the collapse of structured
distinction into intensity, or rules into paradox]{.underline}. ....
[The expression-event is the]{.underline} **[system of the inexplicable:
emergence]{.underline}**, [into and against regeneration]{.underline}
(the reproduction of a structure). .... [Intensity is the
unassimilable]{.underline}. (Massumi 26-7)

Just as Massumi locates emergence within the collapse of structure ! "of
rules into paradox" ! Dictee demonstrates how debunking the myths of
language, historicity, and subjectivity reveals more about identity than
finding a subject itself. The event in Dictee is precisely the
participation by Cha's reader that the text demands of her reader
through its words. Dictee ignites a search for the subject that is never
delivered in order to reveal the mythologies that surround our affective
desires for that subject.

As Massumi describes it, [affect is located somewhere between the
material conditions of the body and the body's trajectory path towards
emergence]{.underline}. Closing his chapter on "The Autonomy of Affect",
Massumi describes affect as such: "[The ability of affect to produce an
economic effect more swiftly and surely than economics itself means
that]{.underline} **[affect is a real condition]{.underline}**, [an
intrinsic variable of the late capitalist system, as infrastructural as
a factory]{.underline}." (Massumi 45) The title to his chapter alongside
his final statement reveal the simultaneously metaphysical and physical
nature of affect as also found in Dictee. Massumi offers [the anchor
that resists the dematerialization of the body in unbounded
indeterminacy]{.underline}. By asserting the autonomy of affect, Massumi
argues that [its]{.underline} "[disconnection between form/content and
intensity/effect is not just negative: it enables a]{.underline}
**[different connectivity, a different difference, in
parallel]{.underline}**." (Massumi 25) In other words, Massumi [suggests
that we]{.underline} disconnect the intense effects of political
inequity from the materiality of the body such that we **[reframe our
politics]{.underline}** [towards new and partial connections that
reflect the]{.underline} **[technological permutations]{.underline}**
[of a re-ordered hegemonic system]{.underline} ! as described by Haraway
in her "informatics of domination": "Simultaneously material and
ideological, the dichotomies may be [expressed]{.underline}
\[[as]{.underline}\] [transitions from the comfortable old hierarchical
dominations to the scary new networks]{.underline} I have [called the
informatics of domination]{.underline}" (Haraway 162).

Kim (2010) articulates a **[methodological praxis]{.underline}** to
challenge these systems of domination through her theorization [of Asian
American cultural production]{.underline}:

Asian American culture [as]{.underline} also **[engaging in a politics
of refusal]{.underline}**. [In refusing the **seductive will** to total
knowledge or revelation of the "truth" of the "Asian American
experience," what it means to be Asian American, or what the United
States "really did" in Asia during the Cold War, Asian American culture
enact]{.underline} what in anthropological term has been called
"**[ethnographic refusal]{.underline}**" (Kim, 2010, p. 6)

Although Kim's (2010) work is germane to notions of America, it is also
produced through a transnational lens. [Applying]{.underline} her work
[to the]{.underline} **[Asiatic Diaspora]{.underline}** [as a whole, we
begin to understand how we can]{.underline} **[collectively
work]{.underline}** [to produce counter-hegemonic
resistance]{.underline}. Additionally, [as Asian scholars located within
the United States, our frame of analysis cannot be separated from our
positionality which begins these points of inquiry. Diaspora produces
a]{.underline} **[condition of melancholia]{.underline}** [from loss
which can be described as a process of]{.underline}
**[subjectivization]{.underline}** [because loss is an overdetermined
sense of self]{.underline} (Eng, 2010). [Diasporic Asian cultural
production thus]{.underline} **[rejects and critiques]{.underline}**
[gendered and racialized quotidian violence]{.underline}. [It
is]{.underline} a **[refusal to become respectable and docile
subjects]{.underline}**. It is a refusal [to have Asians be flattened
and made into technocratic tools]{.underline}. It is a refusal [to
be]{.underline} **[integrated within liberal multicultural
institutions]{.underline}**. It is a refusal [to be consumed by the
white masculine hegemonic gaze]{.underline}. Furthermore, [it attempts
to bridge, build, and empower Asians across many geographic locations
brought by diaspora]{.underline}. Diasporic Asian cultural production
attempts to build [transnational solidarity]{.underline}.
Transnationality, here, comes from Lisa Yoneyama (2015) in Cold War in
Ruins:

...transnationality means much more than mere movements across
nation-states, borders, or exchanges among multiple national actors and
locations. It [comprises of]{.underline} **[insurgent
memories]{.underline}**, **[counterknowledge]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[inauthentic identities]{.underline}** [that have
been regimented by the discourse and institution center on
nation-state]{.underline}. (p. 7)

[Such cultural production is a]{.underline} "**[productive
refusal]{.underline}**." Transnationalism is about [producing radical
connections within diaspora and across national borders through
counter-hegemonic praxis;]{.underline} it is about [the ability to
produce new forms of sociality and liberatory visions for such a
heterogeneous group]{.underline}. For Sawayama, transnationality is
**[rooted in]{.underline}** her production of **["inauthentic"
code]{.underline}** which is [scripted by Western modernity and
diaspora]{.underline}.

Much has been written about cyberpunk's depiction of the gendered,
sexualized, and, to a lesser extent, raced body. Wendy Hui Kyong Chun,
in "Race and Software," points out the use of "[high-tech
orientalism]{.underline}" in "foundational cyberpunk previsions, from
William Gibson's 1984 Neuromancer to Neal Stephenson's 1993 Snow Crash,
\[that\] [use 'Asian,' 'African,' and 'half-breed' characters to
create]{.underline} **[seductively dystopian near
futures]{.underline}**" (306). The "high-tech orientalism" of which Chun
writes has [often]{.underline} been **[located in female
bodies]{.underline}**. While the [female characters]{.underline} in
classic cyberpunk are imbued with high-tech gadgetry---like
Neuromancer's Molly's mirror shades and nail blades---they
[are]{.underline} also "**[Orientalized]{.underline}**," [rendered as
"meat" and objects of]{.underline} **[white, Western male
desire]{.underline}**. Chun argues that, as a way to know and make the
Other accessible and open to the user/reader, "[high-tech orientalism
offers the pleasure of exploring,]{.underline} the pleasure of [being
somewhat overwhelmed but ultimately 'jackedin']{.underline}" (306--307).
In this chapter, I take up two feminist revisions of [technoOrientalist
cyberpunk tropes]{.underline} ([the]{.underline}
**["pleasure"]{.underline}** [and real-world]{.underline}
**[consequences]{.underline}** [of technological
exploration]{.underline}) in Tricia Sullivan's Maul (first published in
2003) and Larissa Lai's Salt Fish Girl (first published in 2002).

Feminist Post-cyberpunk and the Raced Body

Before I discuss Maul and Salt Fish Girl, it is important to situate
these texts in their generic context: cyberpunk and feminist speculative
fiction (SF). In Rewired, James Patrick Kelly and John Kessel trace the
ways in which 1980s cyberpunk has matured into today's post-cyberpunk:
"Originally '[the]{.underline} street' in CP \[cyberpunk\] meant the
shadowy world of those who had set themselves against the norms of the
dominant culture, hackers, thieves, spies, scam artists, and drug users.
But for PCP \[[post-cyberpunk]{.underline}\] writers the [street leads
to other parts of the world]{.underline}. Their [futures]{.underline}
have become [more diverse, and richer for it.]{.underline} Asians and
Africans and Latinos are no longer just sprinkled into stories as
supporting characters, as if they are some sort of exotic seasoning. PCP
writers attempt to bring them and their unique concerns to the centre of
their stories" (xi). Post-cyberpunk retains the original "adversarial
relationship to consensus reality" (xii), but opens up the ranks of its
characters (and writers) to include all of those who make up the global
underclass. Feminist SF, following a similar generic trajectory, began
moving away from its utopian-centric narratives of the 1960s and 1970s
into stories that incorporated substantial technological themes and
tropes (many of which were reminiscent of those characteristic of the
cyberpunk movement) during the 1980s and the 1990s.

One of the great sticking points for feminist scholars when reading
cyberpunk has been the centrality of the cyberspace (or console) cowboy,
usually a young man who plugs into the feminized cyberspace matrix to
become the idealized hacker-hero. Focusing on the foundational work of
William Gibson's Neuromancer series, Nicola Nixon argues, "The political
(or even revolutionary) potential for SF, realized so strongly in '70s
feminist SF, is relegated in Gibson's cyberpunk to a form of scary
feminized software; his fiction creates an alternative, attractive, but
hallucinatory world which allows not only a reassertion of male mastery
but a virtual celebration of a kind of primal masculinity" (204). A good
deal of this "**[primal masculinity]{.underline}**" [relies
on]{.underline} **[technoOrientalist tropes]{.underline}** [to provide
the]{.underline} settings and peoples that support this [hallucinatory
world of]{.underline} **[male mastery for Western white
men]{.underline}** [and their technological toys]{.underline} (e.g.,
Neuromancer's Case and his Japanese-made "Ono-Sendai Cyberspace 7"
cyberdeck and goggles).

With their critiques of capitalism and globalization, the latest
generation of feminist SF novels echo cyberpunk's concerns with commerce
and power as they continue to address issues of gender and racialized
identity. I classify this coming together of the two subgenres as
feminist post-cyberpunk, exemplified by texts such as Sullivan's Maul
and Lai's Salt Fish Girl. I suggest that feminist post-cyberpunk takes
the most intriguing parts of cyberpunk---cyberspace, biotechnological
engagement, urban dystopia, and global networks---while rejecting its
white (heterosexual) masculine claims on both the subject and
technology. **[Feminist post-cyberpunk]{.underline}** [takes in a
broader consideration of what it means to be gendered and raced in an
age when technology transcends geopolitical borders and exists both
outside and inside of the body]{.underline}. Lai's Salt Fish Girl and
Sullivan's Maul are populated with the marginalized characters of
cyberpunk's past: women of color, clones, lesbians, children, the poor,
and the disabled. In each text, these once sidelined figures take center
stage as they directly interact with or literally embody technology.

In "After/Images of Identity," Lisa Nakamura states, ["Rather than being
left behind, bracketed, or 'radically questioned,' the body---the raced,
gendered, classed body---gets '**outed'** in cyberspace just as soon as
commerce and power come into play"]{.underline} (329). To borrow
Nakamura's use of "outing" here, [feminist post-cyberpunk
texts]{.underline} tend to explicitly ["out" the gendered and raced
body, especially in terms of its role in networks of commerce and
power]{.underline} (often highlighting situations of exploitation). In a
novel like Salt Fish Girl, where the "outing" is wholly intentional, Lai
wants the reader to know exactly who is at the center of her novel (a
young queer Asian woman) [in order to]{.underline} **[fully
empower]{.underline}** [that identity position despite attempts to
control and diminish it]{.underline}. In Sullivan's Maul, however, the
"outing" of the female Korean American protagonist Sun is not as
empowering as she is revealed to be a technological product (i.e., a
computer generated avatar). In the rest of this chapter, I articulate
the ways in which these [feminist post-cyberpunk]{.underline} novels
**[give voice]{.underline}** [to Asian women in high-tech future
worlds]{.underline}, but, at times, still struggle to completely reject
the techno-Orientalism of classic cyberpunk.

### Advocacy\-\--Identity Politics

In Imagine Otherwise, Kandice Chuh recognizes the critical cogency for
Asian American studies to consider postmodern insights about the
limitations of representation: "Asian American studies may be seen as a
formation of the critical landscape configured by a (poststructural)
problematization of referentiality, which facilitates the (postmodern)
jettisoning of the authority of the meta-narrative." (Chuh 5)2 However,
not only does Chuh suggest a need for a critical postmodern lens, she
asserts that [Asian American subjectivity is a]{.underline}
**[particularly productive space]{.underline}** [to explore evolving
notions of referentiality and multiplicity.]{.underline} She observes
how [Asian American subjects are]{.underline} **[racially-marked
bodies]{.underline}** [that exceed the nation-state circumscriptions of
the abstracted citizen through their ability to traverse boundaries both
geographical and ideological]{.underline}:

I suggest that it is precisely because U.S. nationalism has constituted
["Asian America" as a transnational identity]{.underline} that it [has
power as an analytic in]{.underline} **[exposing the
failures]{.underline}** [of the U.S. nation-state's promises of
universal equality]{.underline}. .... In this manner, [transnationalism
might be seen as a discourse that]{.underline} **[advances
investigations]{.underline}** [of the technologies of race]{.underline}
and U.S. national identity formation, or perhaps more pointedly, the
technology of race [as a technology of U.S. national
identity]{.underline}. (Chuh 60-1)

Using transnationality as a physical and a metaphysical term, Chuh is
careful to clarify that the [Asian American transnational paradigm
refers not only to the material "crossborder flows of people, capital
and cultures"]{.underline} (Chuh 62), [but also the "border crossings
without literal movement"]{.underline} (ibid) [that break]{.underline}
**[new imaginative grounds]{.underline}** [towards]{.underline}
"[political and cultural practices]{.underline} **[illegible
in]{.underline}** the **[official discourse of the U.S.
nation-state]{.underline}**." (ibid) In this way, Chuh calls for the
crucial task to examine as yet unexamined postmodern permutations of
hegemonic technologies that work to contain and oppress
Asiatically-marked bodies.

In Immigrant Acts, Lisa Lowe applies a materialist critique in her
examination of how U.S. nation-state technologies of citizenship based
on the abstract liberal subject is predicated on the ideologically
paradoxical foundations of national exclusion and material exploitation
of the transnational Asian immigrant. Lowe emphasizes the political
exigency for Asian American scholars to critically engage in the
historical [and sociological contradictions]{.underline} that
[simultaneously disenfranchise the Asian American subject and
substantiate the abstract U.S. citizen]{.underline}. Focusing on the
[material conditions]{.underline} that [have systemically excluded
Asiatically-marked bodies from **national subjecthood**]{.underline},
Lowe locates political resistance in the very prefiguration of this
racializing technology that constitutes U.S. citizenship:

[As the state legally transforms the Asian alien into the Asian American
citizen, it institutionalizes the]{.underline} **[disavowal of the
history of racialized labor exploitation]{.underline}** [and
disenfranchisement through the]{.underline} **[promise of
freedom]{.underline}** in the political sphere. [Yet the historical and
continued racialization of the Asian American]{.underline}, as citizen,
[exacerbates]{.underline} \[my emphasis\] [the contradictions of the
national project]{.underline} that promises the resolution of material
inequalities through the political domain of equal representation. (Lowe
10)

Lowe elucidates a **[political potentiality]{.underline}** [in
recognizing Asian American transnationality]{.underline} in that the
[racialization of Asian American subjects highlights the hypocrisy and
racism of the U.S.]{.underline} democratic [rhetoric of freedom and
equality]{.underline}. Furthermore, Lowe reveals how [the ideological
sustains the material conditions that perpetuate political inequity for

[Sawayama's]{.underline} music videos, futuristic aesthetic, and
[lyricism]{.underline} **[deconstructs]{.underline}** [the West's
normalization of Asian women's subservience.]{.underline} In "Cyber
Stockholm Syndrome," she sings about her personal relationship with
technology as a site of solidarity and support, specifically singing,
"Came here on my own / But I start to feel alone / Better late than
never so I\'ll be alright / Happiest whenever I\'m with you online"
(Sawayama, 2017). Here, she also demonstrates how she found an escape
from white supremacy through music and the cyber world. Specifically,
[this song was a project of catharsis to escape whiteness in a different
world]{.underline} (Clarke, 2017; Myers, 2017). This [production
confronts how the cyber realm is traditionally encoded as a sphere of
white men's power as they control narratives of development, innovation,
and technological "progress," establishing technocratic, intangible
spaces of dominance]{.underline}. Sawayama's
**[performativity]{.underline}** [thus]{.underline} **[becomes a means
to subvert or "hack" the gendered racial formation]{.underline}**
[forced upon Asian women]{.underline}. [Hacking]{.underline}, here,
"[offers an]{.underline} **[eccentric mode of expression]{.underline}**,
[a means]{.underline} **[to rupture]{.underline}**\[\...\]**[symbolic
currencies and tendencies]{.underline}**\[\...\]**[which can be then
decoded or scrambled]{.underline}**" (Bui, 2014). [Sawayama's "hacking"
of techno-Orientalism is a process of]{.underline}
**[unintelligibility]{.underline}** [that creates]{.underline} **[new
modes of sociality]{.underline}** in that her [performance deconstructs
Western norms imposed on Asian women]{.underline}. This emerges as
people are unable to auditorily grasp and categorize her music. Hacking
is produced from her sense of hybridity. She hacks the dragon lady/lotus
blossom binary imposed on Asian women. She hacks the West/East binary
[via the production of]{.underline} **[diaspora]{.underline}**.

In A Cyborg Manifesto, Donna Haraway (1991) expands upon how [technology
can be utilized as a means of subversion writing, "coded texts through
which we engage in the play of writing and reading the
world"]{.underline} (p. 152). For Haraway, [the cyborg exists in
the]{.underline} **[liminal space between human and
technology]{.underline}**, which is [similar to the configuration of
Asians in a techno-Orientalist framework]{.underline} (Haraway, 1991;
Roh et al, 2015). [Here, the cyborg]{.underline}
**[disturbs]{.underline}** a **[Western understanding]{.underline}** [of
what does/does not constitute the human self by disrupting normative
forms of embodiment, subjectivity, and sociality]{.underline} (Haraway,
1991).

In her [utilization of cyborgism]{.underline} in the music video for
"Cyber Stockholm Syndrome," Sawayama [breaks the boundaries between what
is technological and what is human, a subversion of the technologization
of Asiatic bodies and a form of **self-empowerment**]{.underline} (Bui,
2014; Haraway, 1991). Sawayama becomes cyborgian through the
digitization of her body and surroundings (her steampunk aesthetic, the
futuristic background surrounding the car, and the scripting of binary
code across her face), which operate as a manifestation of
techno-Orientalist logics as she becomes one with technology the same
way Asiatic bodies are digitized in the 21st century. Her choice to
physically embody technology is thus [an instance of]{.underline}
**[overidentification]{.underline}** [used to disrupt the Occidental
gaze and subvert technoOrientalist norms]{.underline}. In Digitizing
Race, Lisa Nakamura (2008) highlights the simultaneous debilitating and
liberating use of technology on and by Asian bodies. [In relation to
race neutrality and the erasure of racial violence in the
West]{.underline}, Nakamura (2008) states that "[the 'cyberspace
model'\...ignores these crucial differences. The **reduction of all
images to sets of binary code** seems to pool them all into an
undifferentiated soup of bits and bytes]{.underline}" (p. 7). [Thus, the
Western (white) relationship with technology hinges on a method
of]{.underline} **[erasing difference]{.underline}**, [a model
of]{.underline} **[racial neutrality]{.underline}** [that only white
individuals are capable of accessing]{.underline} in that only white
individuals can distance themselves from their race, [whereas people of
color are always already racialized and coded into particular
stereotypes]{.underline}. Sawayama's [overidentification with
technology, a source of Asiatic stereotyping, then, is a **physical and
metaphysical embodiment**]{.underline} [that escapes the
universalization of the cyber realm as understood by the West, instead
using cyberspace to create her **own sphere of agency**]{.underline}.

### Advocacy\-\--Sinofuturism

#### Thus, we embrace [Sinofuturism]{.underline}. In the cybernetic age, our [criminal]{.underline} [cyber-exoticism]{.underline} outlines a [darkside cartography]{.underline} of the East that [resituates]{.underline} our temporal imaginaries towards Asian knowledge in the face of Western anxiety. While they tie us to the [past]{.underline}, we soar into the [future]{.underline}.

//CHC-DS 🐱‍👤

The earliest documented use of the term is to be found in 'Fei ch\'ien
rinse out: **[Sino-futurist under-currency]{.underline}**', an essay
written in 2003 by musician and cultural theorist Steve Goodman. Drawing
on the tactics of Afrofuturism, Goodman [combines references to
Chinese]{.underline} **[philosophical traditions]{.underline}**,
**[organized crime syndicates]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[underground trading networks]{.underline}** [with the rise
of]{.underline} **[cybernetics]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[computing technology]{.underline}**, [outlining]{.underline} **["a
darkside cartography of the turbulent rise of East Asia"]{.underline}**.
This [sinofuturist imaginary emphasizes the deleuzoguattarian
"co-stratification" of East and West]{.underline} (Goodman), which is
epitomized by the convergence of communication technologies and global
capital. Goodman orbited around the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit
(CCRU), a Warwick-based collective experimenting at the nexus of
underground cultures and philosophical speculation around the turn of
the millennium, and inklings of sinofuturism can be found in writings by
central members of this group. Most notably, Nick Land's 1994 essay
'Meltdown' contains the ur-sinofuturist aphorism "Neo-China arrives from
the future" (Land), and Sadie Plant's book Zeros + Ones is steeped in
Asia-futurist intuitions:

[Five hundred years of modernity fades when the weaving of bamboo mats
converges with the manufacture of computer games in the streets of
Bangkok, Taipei, and Shanghai.]{.underline} **[The silicon links were
already there]{.underline}**. (253)

[Sinofuturism]{.underline} is an enticing proposition. Firstly, it
[portends to overcome the arbitrary distinction between China's ancient
past and its contemporary modernization, promising to]{.underline}
**[open up knowledge production]{.underline}** [about]{.underline} the
People's Republic of [China towards its uncharted future]{.underline}.
Secondly, sinofuturism seems [sufficiently justified by historical
trends and ongoing geopolitical developments: China's consolidation as a
superpower on the world stage, its massive process of urbanization
creating hundreds of cities in a few decades, as well as its successes
in the realm of science and technology all point to the undeniable
futurity of the PRC]{.underline}. At the same time---a chiefly
Euro-American, Anglo-centric time, to be sure--- [sinofuturism relies
on]{.underline} **[discursive tropes]{.underline}** and explanatory
models [that should appear suspicious to observers familiar with the
representational genealogies of expertise about East Asia and "the
Orient" at large]{.underline}. [Under its]{.underline} **[glossy veneer
of science-fictional novelty and cyber-exoticism]{.underline}**,
[sinofuturism partakes in the]{.underline} **[problematic
heritage]{.underline}** [of an enduring]{.underline}
**[techno-orientalist discourse]{.underline}**.

The concept of [techno-orientalism was]{.underline} originally proposed
to account for the emergence of a Western discourse about Japan's
technological development during the late 1980s and early 1990s,
[typified by the assertion that "Japan has become synonymous with the
technologies of the future"]{.underline} (Morley and Robins 168).
[Technoorientalist themes resonate strikingly with]{.underline}
**[stereotyped depictions]{.underline}** [of many East Asian countries:
the Japanese's "robot-like dedication" to both work and world
domination,]{.underline} their [inscrutable culture of self-censorship,
as well as]{.underline} their [remorseless practices of copycatting all
present a threat to the Western grip on modernity]{.underline}
(150-158). Morley and Robins prophetically recognize that [after Japan,
other East Asian locales--- first the]{.underline} "**[Four Asian
Tigers]{.underline}**" [of Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong,
then China---]{.underline}will likely [become the subject of
techno-orientalist representations]{.underline} (173), and recent
history has proven their intuition to be correct. As Wendy Hui Kyong
Chun notes, [a generalized "high tech orientalism" has come to pervade
most depictions of East Asia in popular culture, offering the modern
Western subject "**a way to steer through the future**, or more properly
represent the future as something that can be negotiated"]{.underline}
(178).

When compared with Edward Said's foundational critique of orientalism,
it is clear that [techno-orientalism]{.underline} propagates similar
imaginaries by [foreground]{.underline}ing **[technology over
tradition]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[substituting the past with
the future]{.underline}**. Said's central contention is that [Western
accounts of the Orient consistently denied it the possibility and
legitimacy of representing itself]{.underline}. [Orientalists worked
**in parallel with colonial enterprises**]{.underline} [by envisioning
themselves on a mission to recover the Orient's lost past in order to
improve its present---and extractive or
subjugated---condition]{.underline} (Said 78). [Techno-orientalist
imaginaries similarly encroach upon the articulation of]{.underline}
**[situated temporalities]{.underline}** and impose their own
correlations between technology and the future; and yet, [in contrast to
its colonial antecedent, high-tech orientalism responds to a
fundamental]{.underline} **[Western anxiety]{.underline}** [about a
perceived loss of civilizational primacy on the global
stage]{.underline} (Ang). The commonalities between sinofuturism and
techno-orientalism begin to shine through metropolitan skylines and
neon-tinged haze, betraying a common mechanism underlying their
operations.

In his discipline-rattling book Time and the Other, Johannes Fabian
ruthlessly dismantles anthropology's "schizogenic use of time" (Bunzl
xi) by demonstrating how [the production of ethnographic knowledge is
predicated upon a]{.underline} **[temporal distancing of its
Other]{.underline}**. Anthropologists in the field regularly inhabit and
embody different temporalities than their informants (Fabian 21) and,
even more crucially, their writing [relies on]{.underline} a distancing
device that Fabian terms **["denial of coevalness"]{.underline}**,
[which is "a persistent and systematic tendency to place the referent(s)
of anthropology in a Time other than the present of the producer of
anthropological discourse"]{.underline} (31, italics in original). The
denial of coevalness allows anthropology [to approach its Other as if it
inhabited a temporally bounded culture functioning as]{.underline}
"[a]{.underline} kind of **[timemachine]{.underline}**" (39) for
comparative and evolutionary inquiry. All kinds of orientalism
presuppose this denial of coevalness, and **[supporting]{.underline}** a
**[re-entrenchment of the Western present]{.underline}**---irrespective
of the orientation of the temporal representation employed---is the
primary purpose of this mechanism.

This genealogy of temporal othering evidences how both [sinofuturism and
technoorientalism are not merely culpable of propagating exoticizing
fantasies about the future in China or other Asian contexts, but also
responsible for perpetuating a more generalized denial of
coevalness]{.underline}. In contrast with established orientalist tropes
and with more recent liberal-democratic varieties of "sinological
orientalism" (Vukovich), [China is no longer deemed to be trapped in its
atemporal pastness or condemned to eventually synchronize with
modernity: instead, it]{.underline} **[already inhabits the
future]{.underline}**, [arrives from it, or beckons a **Chinese mode of
futurity**]{.underline} with global implications. In all these variants,
sinofuturist imaginations deny China the possibility of challenging and
negotiating representation in the coeval present staked out by Western
knowledge production. **[The future is for sinofuturists what the past
was for orientalists]{.underline}**: [a foil for]{.underline}
**[steering representation]{.underline}** [by denying
coevalness]{.underline}.

The legitimacy of sinofuturism is premised on a parallelism with other
emerging articulations of futurity: the comparative approach proposed by
Armen Avanessian and Mahan Moalemi, for example, juxtaposes it with
Afrofuturism, gulf futurism and other 'ethnofuturisms',
[highlighting]{.underline} the novel emergence of [futureoriented
imaginaries from non-Western contexts]{.underline}. While this approach
cautions that futuristic articulations "outside of the west and across
the Global South and other former peripheries can also evolve into
neo-colonial tendencies" (Avanessian et al. 9), it also glosses over a
more fundamental problem of serializing ethnic or national futurisms:
their reference to the future might be the only contact point between
otherwise radically different aesthetic and ethical programs---something
that the history of Italian futurism glaringly evidences. Even Lawrence
Lek's artwork Sinofuturism (1839-2046 AD), which has become a defining
reference for this term, repeatedly reaches for [a common tactical
repertoire among "minority movements which share an **optimism about
speed, velocity, and the future as a means to subvert the institutions
of the present**"]{.underline} (Lek)

As proven by Afrofuturism, [movements that upend hegemonic and colonial
temporal frameworks are]{.underline} **[fundamental]{.underline}** [to
reclaiming]{.underline} **[representational agency]{.underline}**
against the denial of coevalness. But in order to do so, they have to
organically emerge from the periphery of Western time, rather than be
conjured as part of technoorientalist fantasies. Instead, while the
post-digital exotic pastiches of sinofuturism have circulated enough to
consolidate into a recognizable aesthetic appropriated and subverted by
local electronic musicians and new media artists, it is their less
self-aware and more sensational variety that continues to find currency
in popular representations of China. The introductory chapter of William
A. Callahan's China Dreams: 20 Visions of the future, aptly titled
"China is the future," offers a striking example of this banal brand of
sinofuturism:

It's an exciting time to be Chinese. While in the West the first decade
of the 21st century was defined by pessimism due to 9/11, the Iraq War,
and the Great Recession, Chinese people are very optimistic that the
21st century will be the "Chinese century." The fruits of China's three
decades of rapid economic growth are there for all to see: by 2010, the
People's Republic of China (PRC) had the fastest computer in the world
and the smartest students in the world, and it was enthusiastically
entering the space age---just as the United States was retiring its
fleet of Space Shuttles. (Callahan 1)

This book's first paragraph strings together many of the tropes
highlighted above: national identity, the idea of a Chinese century, the
PRC's economic growth, and the post-reform developmental leapfrogging
indexed by the trifecta of computational primacy, academic talent and
space exploration, all measured against rusty yardsticks left over from
the Cold War era.

To sum up: [sinofuturism responds to a]{.underline} **[lack of
engagement]{.underline}** [with China's future in both academic
expertise and popular discussions of the country]{.underline}. It does
so **[provocatively]{.underline}**, [by speculating on possible future
configurations of wildly different aspects of Chinese history, culture
and society, juxtaposing technological developments and traditional
customs, global trends and local phenomena, political systems and
material forces]{.underline}. At the same time, [sinofuturism draws
on]{.underline}--- and at times directly reproduces---[the tropes and
narratives of techno-orientalism]{.underline}, reducing China to the
last in a series of East Asian countries investing resources [to
accelerate industrialization and informatization and thus threatening
the Western grip on technological innovation and transnational supply
chains]{.underline}. The historical superimposition of
techno-orientalism with popular culture genres like
**[cyberpunk]{.underline}** [offers a]{.underline} convenient [route for
sinofuturism to find success as an]{.underline} **[aesthetic
repertoire]{.underline}** that is [legible across contexts: outside
China, it reacts with the mixture of fascination and anxiety for the
illegibility and scale of China's rise; inside China, it lends itself to
the self-orientalizing celebration of national success]{.underline}. But
this should not obfuscate its main operation.

[Sinofuturism, like techno-orientalism, operates as a denial of
coevalness]{.underline}. In being largely articulated from the outside
as an interpretive discourse, it posits some sort of equivalence between
China and the future: **[China is the future, China comes from the
future, the future will come from China]{.underline}**, and so on. These
proclaimations are as enticing as they are suspect, for they deploy the
future as a way of deferring participation in contemporariness. The
future functions exactly as the past does in orientalist arguments: as a
temporality through which otherness can be safely managed and
problematic interactions steered away from. If the locus of Said's
orientalism was the Hejaz region, "a locale about which one can make
statements regarding the past in exactly the same form (and with the
same content) that one makes them regarding the present" (Said 235),
[the loci of sinofuturism are the skylines of Shanghai, Shenzhen, and
Chongqing, ready to be inscribed with claims about the
future.]{.underline} **[Sinofuturism is a reverse
orientalism]{.underline}**---an orientalism [operating its denial of
coevalness through the attribution of futurity]{.underline}.

In conclusion, I believe that my drastic evaluation should be a warning
rather than a veto. [While dealing with the present is unavoidable, the
future is arguably the temporal domain most relevant for
the]{.underline} **[construction of more livable]{.underline}** (or even
just survivable) **[shared worlds]{.underline}** (Powers). There is
nothing wrong with envisioning China's future, tracing its
future-oriented discourses, and speculating about its impact on regional
and global futures, as long as one keeps in mind the implications of any
sort of temporal othering. Fabian's ideal of coevalness, the
[intersubjective engagement]{.underline} that [demands the Other's
inclusion in a shared present]{.underline}, cannot be achieved by simply
referring to a country as 'contemporary': [what is demanded
is]{.underline} instead [the extension of a]{.underline}
**[co-presence]{.underline}** [in which the Other's time can be allowed
its own situatedness and contingency]{.underline}. Imagining the rise of
a modernizing China through the mediation of Western media, the waning
echoes of Japan panic and an established cyberpunk canon during the
1990s resulted in the provocative speculations of sinofuturism--- today,
**[one can take some steps forward, or perhaps sideways]{.underline}**,
[towards coevalness.]{.underline}

Luckily, there is no shortage of articulations of the future in China,
all waiting to be encountered in their own terms. Chinese philosophical
traditions have argued around different conceptions of time over
centuries, utopian futurity has driven numerous upheavals, and
[revolutionary temporality has been a]{.underline} **[key ideological
battleground]{.underline}** [around the founding of the People's
Republic of China]{.underline} (Qian). The history of the Chinese
Communisty Party's economic development is written in official plans
spanning years or entire decades, and yet its technological policy has
also been influenced by unlikely conversations with Western futurists
(Gewirtz). Even more prominently, a century of Chinese science fiction
has eventually found international success through translations and has
been crowned by the Hugo Award conferred to Liu Cixin in 2015 (Song).
[There are countless futures to be found in the work of Chinese
thinkers, academics, directors, writers and politicians, and these
should not just be earmarked as a term of comparison for]{.underline}
([or an alternative to]{.underline}) [Western modernity]{.underline}
(Greenspan et al.), but as coeval articulations of time. **[It is time
to think]{.underline}**, plurally, **[in terms of sinofuturisms, and to
encounter Chinese futures that have always been already
there]{.underline}**.

### Advocacy\-\--Virtuality

#### Narrative imaginations of identity at the [edge of the virtual]{.underline}, [seeping]{.underline} between the [virtual]{.underline} and the [real]{.underline}, are where [affective potential]{.underline} is unlocked. Only by engaging the virtual can we understand [emergence]{.underline} and utilize its [triggerings of change]{.underline}.

The connection between identity simulation and virtual narrative can be
found in Hayles's comment on literature as simulation in her text, My
Mother Was a Computer: Digital Subjects and Literary Texts:
"...[literature functions more like simulations than do other discursive
forms, because like computer simulations]{.underline} such as Karl
Sims's "Evolved Virtual Creatures", [literary texts create imaginary
worlds populated by creatures that we can (mis)take for beings like
ourselves]{.underline}. (Hayles 6) Likening literature with computer
simulations, Hayles points out how [narratives can create creatures that
we mistake for ourselves -- and]{.underline} **[is this not
identity?]{.underline}** Additionally, Massumi correlates the vital role
that imagination plays in the world of virtuality when he states:
"[Imagination is the mode of thought most precisely suited to the
differentiating **vagueness of the virtual**]{.underline}." (Massumi
134) For Massumi, **[imagination is key]{.underline}** [because it
sparks virtuality; virtuality is key because it triggers
emergence:]{.underline} "[Concepts of the virtual]{.underline} in itself
are important only to the extent to which they [contribute to a
pragmatic understanding of emergence, to the extent to which they enable
triggerings of change]{.underline} [(induce the new)]{.underline}. **[It
is the edge of virtual]{.underline}**, [where it leaks into
actual]{.underline}, [that counts]{.underline}. [For that seeping edge
is]{.underline} **[where potential]{.underline}**, actually, **[is
found]{.underline}**." (Massumi 43) Massumi limns the boundary that lies
between the virtual and the actual as the locus where emergence occurs.
It is this locus where Choi's narrative simulates identity. American
Woman is a narrative wrought from the paradigm of [actuality to create a
virtual narrative that leaks into our **personal consciousness** as
political awareness]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} **[affective power]{.underline}** [behind]{.underline}
this sort of [virtual narrative lies in our apprehension of what we
already know and what we **desire to discover**]{.underline}. Choi
clearly founds much of her narrative on the easily-recognized media
coverage of the Patty Hearst case. But instead of narrating a
non-fictional account that would replicate the U.S. media coverage of
the privileged "American princess", Choi rejects this paradigm for one
that favors the barely known Asian American woman known to have
accompanied Hearst in their final year in hiding, Wendy Yoshimura. Thus,
despite her choice to use the Patty Hearst case as a platform for her
narrative, Choi places her Japanese American protagonist, Jenny Shimada,
center stage. In a way, Choi bait-and-switches her readers by packaging
a story about an American princess -- someone we visualize to be white
and privileged -- and instead offers us the unheard story of someone who
is neither white nor privileged. Subsequently, Choi's title to her novel
patently points to her own bait-and-switch narrative tactic. [What we
are left to wonder is how]{.underline} much of this story [is "true"
and/or "authentic"]{.underline}?

#### Racial discrimination has [seeped]{.underline} into the [incorporeal]{.underline} -- only by [blurring the lines]{.underline} between the virtual and the material can we [adapt to]{.underline} and [disrupt]{.underline} our representations.

In the 1990s both popular culture and academic theorists promised
freedom from the constraints of race, gender, sexual preference, and
class via the Internet. This optimism was short-lived: [in the
twenty-first century]{.underline}, we know that [bodies matter
and]{.underline} that [narratives about virtual disembodiment or
equality often depend upon the very racial or gendered stereotypes that
they purport to be eradicating]{.underline}.3 Technoculture studies
scholar Lisa Nakamura sets up a key question about race and the
Internet: "Can the Internet propagate genuinely new and nonracist (and
nonsexist and nonclassist) ways of being," or is "online discourse . . .
woven of stereotypical cultural narratives that reinstall \[the\]
conditions of gender, race, and class as conditions of social
interaction?" (Digitizing Race xii). Gibson's Bridge trilogy
investigates this very problem, ultimately demonstrating that
[discourses of race, gender, and class are reliant on the]{.underline}
**[binary opposition]{.underline}** [between]{.underline} **[physical
and virtual]{.underline}**, [as well as interiority and
exteriority]{.underline}. Gibson destabilizes these easy binary
distinctions through the creation of an alternative space, Walled City,
and a character, Rei Toei, who is both real and virtual.

In the future universe of Gibson's trilogy, the Internet has become as
highly regulated and policed as actual physical spaces. In reaction to
this, radicals create a digital city located outside of the restrictions
of the mainstream Internet: Walled City has "no laws . . . just
agreements," and therefore houses an eclectic population who have
founded a new space outside of, and resistant to, the dominant digital
culture (Idoru 209). As Masahiko puts it, it is "of the Net, but not on
it." Gibson's "Walled City" much resembles the "City of Bits" described
by the late William J. Mitchell, who was dean of the school of
architecture at MIT and a prescient urban and media theorist: "This will
be a city unrooted to any definite spot on the surface of the earth,
shaped by connectivity and bandwidth constraints rather than by
accessibility and land values, largely asynchronous in its operation,
and inhabited by disembodied and fragmented subjects who exist as
collections of aliases and agents. Its places will be constructed
virtually by software instead of physically from stones and timbers, and
they will be connected by logical linkages rather than by doors,
passageways, and streets" (William J. Mitchell 24).4 The emphasis on
virtual "logical linkages" over physical barriers like "doors and
passageways" suggests that the virtual city does not share the same
social inequities that are represented by the architectural enclosures
of material cities, meant to keep locals in and invaders out. At the
same time, it would be inaccurate to maintain that Gibson's Walled City
is "unrooted to any definite spot . . . on earth" because we learn that
Walled City is a reproduction of the real city of Kowloon (also known as
Kowloon Walled City). A largely ungoverned settlement in Hong Kong, when
it was a British colony, Kowloon functioned as an autonomous zone that
had been without laws or police because of a mistake in the possession
agreement with China. As described in Gibson's novel Idoru, it was a
tiny space but extremely densely populated, which housed "drugs and
whores and gambling. But people living, too. Factories, restaurants. A
city. No laws" (221).

Gibson's allusion to the historical Kowloon Walled City goes beyond
merely exoticizing the city for its criminality and otherness. Rather, I
argue that the historical allusion grounds Gibson's virtual Walled City
in real, inhabited space, thus disrupting the taken for granted binary
between digital and physical spaces. This linking together of virtual
and material space continues in the first lengthy description of the
city:

Something at the core of things moved simultaneously in mutually
impossible directions. It wasn't even like porting. Software conflict?
Faint impression of light through a fluttering of rags. And then the
thing before her: building or biomass or cliff face looming there, in
countless unplanned strata, nothing about it even or regular. Accreted
patchwork of shallow random balconies, thousands of small windows
throwing back blank silver rectangles of fog. Stretching to the
periphery of vision, and on the high, uneven crest of that ragged
façade, a black fur of twisted pipe, antennas sagging under vine growth
of cable. And past this scribbled border a sky where colors crawled like
gasoline on water. Hak Nam . . . City of Darkness. Between the walls of
the world. (Idoru 195)

Most salient in this passage about Gibson's Walled City are the
architectural structures that abound---buildings, balconies, windows,
and façades. Even though these appear as man-made structures, Gibson
weaves natural or organic imagery into their descriptions: Chia, the
young protagonist of Gibson's second text of the trilogy, can't tell if
what she first sees is a "building" or "cliff face," windows become
"silver rectangles of fog," pipes are described as "black fur," cables
are dense as "vine growth," and the sky is a combination of gasoline and
water. Similarly, diction such as "countless unplanned strata, nothing
about it even or regular," "accreted patchwork," "uneven crest of that
ragged façade," and "scribbled border" repeat the notion of
improvisation over orderliness. This blurring of boundaries between
natural and artificial, material and virtual is what composes this ideal
city of Gibson's. It is a different virtual experience from the
cyberspace of Neuromancer, with its abstract, jewel-colored geometric
forms and its clean dualism of "meat" and virtuality. Bodies and the
spaces they inhabit---Laney's deteriorating body in Cardboard City;
Zona's disabled, brown body in Mexico; Masahiko's unconscious body
sprawled in a love hotel in Tokyo---simply can't be obscured under the
Internet's optimistic rhetoric of universal freedom and the
disappearance of space and distance. The ideal city must combine the
material and the virtual; it must use the new digital order to
restructure and reconfigure our inhabited spaces.

[There is a long philosophical tradition of theorizing the virtual in a
way that suggests that the virtual is consistently tied to the
real]{.underline}. I will briefly survey some of the dominant critical
approaches here, before turning specifically to Brian Massumi's
theoretical model that links new modes of bodily sensation to virtual
experience---of particular importance to our discussion of digital
technologies, race, and embodiment. In Matter and Memory, Henri [Bergson
aligns the virtual with memories and dreams: "Whenever we are trying to
recover a recollection, to call up some period of our history, we become
conscious of an act sui generis by which we detach ourselves from the
present in order to replace ourselves]{.underline}, first, in the past
in general, then [in a certain region of the past---a work of
adjustment]{.underline}, something [like the focusing of a camera. But
our recollection still remains virtual"]{.underline} (143). For Bergson,
**[the virtual]{.underline}** ([dreams, memories, imaginations, pure
qualities]{.underline}) **[is real]{.underline}** [insofar as it has an
effect on us;]{.underline} in other words, [the virtual insists on the
real]{.underline}. It is not accidental that Bergson uses [the analogy
of a technological apparatus---the "focusing of a
camera"---]{.underline}to [ground his notion of the virtual in material
reality]{.underline}. Building on Bergson's ideas, Gilles Deleuze writes
that [both the actual and the virtual are real, but not everything that
is virtual is or becomes actual]{.underline}. Similarly, science
philosopher Pierre Levy maintains: ["The virtual is that which has
potential rather than actual existence. The virtual tends toward
actualization. . . . The tree is virtually present in the
seed"]{.underline} (23).

Political philosopher and social theorist Brian Massumi describes the
virtual [as being akin to unused, potential energy]{.underline}. As he
puts it, "One way of starting to get a grasp on the
real-material-but-incorporeal is to say it is to [the body, as a
positioned thing, as energy is to matter. Energy and matter are mutually
convertible modes of the same reality]{.underline}. This would make [the
incorporeal something like a phase-shift]{.underline} of the body in the
usual sense, but not one that comes after it in time. It would be [a
conversion or unfolding of the body contemporary to its every move.
Always accompanying. Fellow-traveling dimension of the same
reality]{.underline}" (5). Most helpful about Massumi's theory is the
manner in which he describes the virtual [in relation to the body's
sense of affect and sensation]{.underline}. Rather than existing as
abstract information, for Massumi, [the virtual consists of processes
that operate on multiple registers of sensation]{.underline}. He sums
this phenomenon up [as the "'real but abstract' incorporeality of the
body"]{.underline} (21).

Massumi's notion of the virtual sensations of the body finds an
illustrative example in Gibson's Idoru. Returning again to the passage
that details Chia McKenzie's first experience of virtual Walled City, we
encounter multiple references to movement and affect in cyberspace:
"They were inside now, smoothly accelerating, and the squirming density
of the thing was continual visual impact, an optical drumming. . . . A
sharp turn. Another. Then they were ascending a maze of twisting
stairwells, still accelerating, and Chia took a deep breath and closed
her eyes. Retinal fireworks bursting there, but the pressure was gone"
(195--196). The primary sensory quality evident in this passage is that
of sight or vision. On the surface, this dominance of vision aligns with
our typical experience of interacting with the computer or laptop:
viewing a virtual two-dimensional image (or sometimes three-dimensional,
as Internet connectivity and bandwidth constraints evolve) on a screen
and pointing and clicking simultaneously with one's fingers on an
electronic mouse. However, Gibson's depiction of Walled City exceeds
these purely physical, bodily sensations. The visual sensation described
occurs on another register beyond merely seeing, given the diction of
"impact," "drumming," and "fireworks bursting" in conjunction with the
eyes. In terms of the tactile, we are informed of Chia's experience of a
"squirming density" and "pressure" that appears alien and estranging to
our regular body's resistance against gravity. The pressure and density
that Chia experiences most likely come in conjunction with the intense
speeds at which she is traveling in cyberspace. Gibson's portrayal of
her movement in the cyber plane mostly resembles flight, particularly in
conjunction with the pressure that Chia describes (g-force, per
chance?). The way that Chia is able to navigate her virtual body with
sharp turns and accelerations around Walled City's immaterial
architecture, its labyrinth of stairwells and buildings, constitutes an
affective experience that exceed the regular sensations perceived by the
body's sensory organs; Chia's online venture into Walled City can be
accurately described only as sensations of Massumi's
"real-material-but-incorporeal" body. Chia's navigation of her virtual
urban space becomes an experience that augments, supplements, and
cross-hatches her material urban inhabited space.

In creating an alternate space that straddles the incorporeal and the
material, Gibson is perhaps offering us his vision of "genuinely new and
nonracist (and nonsexist and nonclassist) ways of being" (to borrow
Nakamura's earlier phrasing). It is a virtual experience that does not
negate the physical. Put another way, Thomas Foster reminds us that
**[discourses of race]{.underline}** [have long been constructed within
realms of the]{.underline} **[virtual and incorporeal]{.underline}**,
[even before the advent of digital technologies]{.underline}. He points
out "**[there is a specific racial history of the expropriability of the
'soul']{.underline}**" (xxiii) and that "[white power to represent
blackness . . . takes the form of 'miscegenated texts,' in which
AfricanAmericans figure as black bodies with white souls,]{.underline}
that is, [with an interiority comprehensible to white
readers]{.underline}" (xxiii). Given this history, we might conclude
that [discourses of race have been reliant on the binary opposition
between incorporeal and material, as well as interiority and
exteriority]{.underline}. Gibson's Idoru, Rei Toei, proves to be a
thought experiment that challenges and disrupts such oppositions.

Gibson's Idoru: Cybertype or Multicultural Cyborg?

Rei Toei, the idoru or idol singer of the second text of Gibson's
trilogy, is a world-famous pop star, an ideal beauty, an icon of sexual
desire, and an artificially created avatar that disrupts the boundary
between the completely virtual and the completely real. We are told she
is "a personality-construct, a congeries of software agents, the
creation of information-designers" (55). Rei is basically an exotic,
virtual pinup girl, her immateriality inspiring physical male lust. When
she first appears before Rydell---a rent-a-cop who appears in all three
books of the trilogy---she is first naked, and then seen wearing clothes
identical to his own. The detail of mirroring Rydell's clothing suggests
that Rei has no subjectivity of her own, but is only a reflection of
Rydell's masculine, Western desire. Her digital perfection creates an
unrealistic ideal of beauty, which is most likely Gibson's commentary on
media stardom with the fan club that chases Rei and her "lover" Rez in
Idoru.5

Eventually, however, the idoru evolves beyond this simulation of exotic
Asian feminine beauty. At the end of All Tomorrow's Parties, multiple
physical Rei Toeis emerge from nanofax assemblers (a device utilizing
nanotechnology to replicate items in various locations) across the
world, a far cry from her original form as ephemeral hologram. In a
fateful twist of irony, the nanofax assemblers are stationed at Lucky
Dragon franchises. The stores, stereotypes of impersonal Asian global
commodity culture, and their nanotechnology are subversively
reappropriated by Rei. Rather than the goal of virtual disembodiment and
"jacking in" to cyberspace that characterized Gibson's earlier Sprawl
novels, the idoru achieves the opposite objective of moving away from
her original status as digital code toward literal corporeality and
physical embodiment. We are told that she becomes "an emergent system, a
self continually being iterated from experiential input . . . that river
in to which one can never step twice. As she became more herself,
through the inputting of experience, through human interaction, she grew
and changed" (163). Rei Toei herself comments, "I'm so much more . . . I
could go anywhere." Here, while the idoru does not move entirely from
being the sexual object of the male gaze (the multiple Reis emerge naked
from the assemblers), Rei does appear to emerge as sentient subject,
capable of independent thought and mobility. Her nakedness, in contrast
to her earlier propensity to reflect others' clothing appearances, may
suggest a rebirth of sorts, in which Rei is now a blank slate ready to
learn and acclimate to her external environment according to her own
choices and will. The multiple Reis, however, also work to destabilize
the notion of independent subjectivity and free will: we are left
wondering which is the true Rei, or if there never was a true originary
Rei in the first place since she was artificially constructed as a
virtual, hologram idol.

The idoru shifts from object to subject, along with the resultant
potential destabilizing of such subjectivity. As mere software, code,
and programmed sexual desire at her inception, Rei Toei literally
cements the notion of the Orient as an object devoid of subjectivity.
Later, as she emerges naked from every Lucky Dragon nanofax kiosk on
earth, the exoticized desire that she inspires has an uneasy and anxious
merger with her status as autonomous subject. The bystanders watch her
materialize from the assemblers first on television screens (every Lucky
Dragon franchise has television displays of video surveillance of other
Lucky Dragon franchises, all across the world), and then turn in shock
to see Rei, not in the digitally mediated form of the TV screen, but
directly before them in the flesh. This part in the narrative has a
surprising effect of breaking the fourth wall for the reader of Gibson's
text as well: we, like the bystanders outside of the Lucky Dragon, are
accessing Rei virtually (albeit in literary form), but the multiple Reis
that pop out all over the world suggest that she can turn up anywhere,
pushing the reader to not grow too comfortable with passively and
pleasurably absorbing Rei and her story.

In challenging assumed notions regarding virtuality/reality,
interiority/ exteriority, and subjectivity/objectification, Gibson's
Bridge trilogy destabilizes certain binary oppositions and
preconceptions that consistently undergird techno-Orientalist
stereotypes and narratives about Asian peoples and places. His texts
demonstrate that [techno-Orientalist discourses depend upon these
oversimplified and neat binarisms]{.underline}. For instance, Gibson's
earlier Sprawl trilogy was contingent upon oppositions between "meat"
and cyberspace, while the Bridge trilogy challenges us [to think about
the slippage and permeable boundaries between the virtual and the
real]{.underline}. Such speculation [allows for
heterotopias]{.underline} like Gibson's Walled City, [where new modes of
bodily sensation are introduced, and perhaps if we speculate further,
new modes of thinking about racial embodiment **beyond fantasies of
Western penetration of the East**]{.underline}. This is not to say that
there is a symmetry between Western projections of the East and Eastern
imaginings of the West; the West's technoOrientalist representations of
the East are quite powerful and pervasive. While it is important to
critique representations of virtual Orientalism, I argue that such
[critiques are incomplete if they do not move beyond the unidirectional
gaze that the West focuses on the East. We can do such work by examining
the potential for **dynamic crosscurrents** or transactions that move in
both directions]{.underline} ([for instance, the East's projections of
the West, or even of itself]{.underline} ), and by [examining the
potential for techno-Orientalist discourse to]{.underline} **[adapt and
disrupt its own stereotypes and representations]{.underline}**.

### AT: Cap Good\-\--Temporalities

#### Capitalism produces [racialized temporalities]{.underline} in which Chinese labor is [banished]{.underline} into abstractness, alienated from [disguised social relations]{.underline} behind the products of human labor.

**Day 16**, Iyko Day is Associate Professor of English and Critical
Social Thought at Mount Holyoke College and Faculty Member in the Five
College Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program., (Iyko, "Sex, Time, and
the Transcontinental Railroad: Abstract Labor and the Queer
Temporalities of History 2" in *Alien Capital: Asian Racialization and
the Logic of Settler Colonial Capitalism*, Duke University Press)
//CHC-DS 🐱‍👤

By aligning [Chinese]{.underline} bodies with abstract labor, their
[labor represents human labor in the abstract]{.underline}. It is
[this]{.underline} **[phantomlike objectivity]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[alien labor]{.underline}** that [establishes a
commodity's value]{.underline}. [White bodies, on the other hand, are
symbolically associated with concrete labor, which establishes a
commodity's quality]{.underline}.

[Such a]{.underline} **[racial bifurcation]{.underline}** [of abstract
and concrete labor is the work of the]{.underline} **[commodity
fetish]{.underline}**, [which disguises the social relations behind the
products of human labor]{.underline}. In terms of this book's
overarching claim, I argue that a key anchor of [North American settler
colonialism is an ideology of romantic anticapitalism that]{.underline}
reifies a distinction between concrete and abstract social relations out
of a misunderstanding of the dialectical nature of capitalism. Romantic
anticapitalism hypostatizes the concrete, rooted, and pure, on one hand,
and identifies capitalism solely with the abstract dimension of social
relations, on the other. It **[glorifies]{.underline}** [what it sees as
the]{.underline} [**concrete realm of social relations: white labor**,
the family, and the train itself]{.underline}---a machine whose
concreteness is biologized as the "iron horse." Alternatively, [Chinese
bodies are in nearly exclusive alignment with quasi-mechanized labor
temporality, **excluded from normative social and domestic
temporalities**]{.underline}. [Once Chinese labor is no longer needed,
romantic anticapitalism performs an]{.underline} **[aesthetic
function]{.underline}** [by giving Chinese shape to the unrepresentable:
giving bodily form to the abstract, temporal domination of
capitalism]{.underline}. In this sense, [Chinese labor allegorizes the
commensurating function of abstract labor that propels capitalism
forward]{.underline}. However, as Chakrabarty notes, for Marx the
universal category of abstract labor serves two functions: "It is both a
description and a critique of capital."18 Following a Queer Marxist
approach, this chapter will explore how abstract labor can pose such a
critique.

The focus on temporality in Kingston's and Fung's work also serves to
dramatize the impact of industrial technology on conceptions of time in
the nineteenth century. In particular, [railroad construction was
intimately linked to the speed-up and internationalization of uniform
time through technological innovation, time-space compression, and the
standardization of G]{.underline}reenwich [M]{.underline}ean
[T]{.underline}ime. Completing a process of temporal secularization that
began in the Middle Ages, [time's progressive detachment from the cosmos
and human events was achieved in this period of national expansion and
consolidation by rail]{.underline}. No longer did biblical events
structure and determine time, as they once did within traditional Jewish
and Christian conceptions of history; rather, [time became increasingly
continuous, homogeneous, and independent of events]{.underline}.19
Postone refers to this secularized temporality [as "abstract time," "an
independent framework within which motion, events, and action occur . .
. divisible into equal, constant, nonqualitative units."]{.underline}20
Indeed, [the progress of abstract time as a dominant form of time
parallels the development of capitalism as a socially metabolic
totality]{.underline}. In the context of this shift to a more totalizing
capitalist temporality, what Kingston's and Fung's texts illuminate is
how [conceptions of time were]{.underline} **[racialized and
sexualized]{.underline}**. Indeed, as Petrus Liu specifies, it is a
mistake to view socially necessary labor time as solely the mean labor
time associated with technological developments but also in terms of its
moral dimensions. He clarifies that "the value of a commodity is the
amount of human labor embodied in it, but the value of the commodity of
human labor is determined by moral and discursive operations outside the
capitalist reproduction scheme."21 Therefore, [on one hand, white labor
productivity and its heteronormative reproduction become qualitative
expressions of morality and rationality associated with time
discipline]{.underline}. As Michael O'Malley explains, [there was a need
"to protect time's virtue,"]{.underline} its chastity [tied
to]{.underline} "[scientific discipline]{.underline} requiring years of
patient courting to master."22 [On the other]{.underline}, as I suggest
in this chapter, [Chinese labor becomes associated with the abstract,
quantitative domination of labor time]{.underline}. This is what Postone
de scribes as the "temporal dimension of the abstract domination [that
characterizes the structures of]{.underline} **[alienated social
relations]{.underline}** [in capitalism]{.underline}."23 Exposing the
racialized temporalities of the labor process under capitalism, Kingston
and Fung return with queer temporal revisions of labor and reproduction.

In an essay titled "The Rhetoric of Sex / The Discourse of Desire,"
Samuel Delany examines one possible etymology for "discourse" that stems
from the Latin word for an ancient Roman oval racetrack, where
spectators stood on the inside of the track, while the runners raced
around the encircled spectators. These Roman discourses, Delany notes,
"were places of much betting . . . , the touting up of odds, and the
endless speculative conversation on the merits of the racers
characteristic today of horseracing tracks were a part of daily life at
the discourse."1 Building on Michel Foucault's theorizations of
discourse in Archaeology of Knowledge, Delany understands
**[discourse]{.underline}** [as a structuring mechanism]{.underline}
that [not only "tells us what is central and what is peripheral,"
but]{.underline} that [also]{.underline} **[controls the entry and exit
points of that facility]{.underline}**.

Delany identifies the Roman discourse as [an]{.underline} **[archaeology
of knowledge]{.underline}** [that is simultaneously a primal scene for
speculation]{.underline}. Discourse in this example presents itself as a
mostly closed system that facilitates gambling by providing the
conditions of manageable uncertainty without throwing itself over to
chaos. The runners ostensibly never leave the track. What would happen,
though, if they did? Like Foucault, Delany takes more interest in the
multiplicity of discourses, discursive practices, and their
relationships to the anomaly---that which falls beyond the purview of
the discourse. For him, [paying attention to the "**anomalous** and
nonserious" discards of discourse reveals **the exclusionary structuring
mechanisms** of the discourse itself]{.underline}.2 Delany moves through
these thoughts on discourse to arrive at his perhaps better known set of
formulations on paraliterature, which includes speculative fiction and
all sorts of other "anomalous and nonserious" forms of writing. And as
Delany points out, "['anomalous and nonserious' is how the
accomplishments of women]{.underline}, whether in the arts or in the
world, [were judged. And the writings of blacks]{.underline} in this
country were, until very recently, considered even more of an accident."

**["By our strangeness, we write our bodies into the
future,"]{.underline}** Miranda says.3 She's talking about genetic
mutation, but Larissa Lai also [invokes queer and migrant
futurity]{.underline}. [These are the anomalous futures that have run
amok from the discourse of speculation]{.underline}. Migrant Futures has
been a study of speculation not so much as a genre, but rather as a
discursive practice. **[Migrant futures are epistemological
anomalies]{.underline}**. They are [science fictions **less interested
in getting the science right than in interrogating the systems** that
produced that science]{.underline}.

[Speculation becomes a colonizing mechanism when it attempts to capture,
profit from, and realize the future]{.underline}.
**[Predictions]{.underline}**, premeditations, **[precautions,
preparedness]{.underline}**---these [are all signposts of a speculative
science working to]{.underline} **[colonize the future]{.underline}**.
This book has located several arenas in which [speculation has met up
with]{.underline} these [imperialist logics: the financial derivatives
market, **military securitization**]{.underline}, transnational
surrogacy insurance, **[global development]{.underline}** banking, as
well as **[bio]{.underline}**- and **[geo-engineering]{.underline}**.
Speculation as discourse has been around for some time in various
guises. [Consider]{.underline}, for example, [the]{.underline}
**[progress narrative]{.underline}** [that primes the funding rationale
for Henry Ford's rubber plantation in Brazil.]{.underline} I have called
attention to it in the figuration of homeland futurity at the
U.S.-Mexico border. But it has been more interested in highlighting what
it might mean to speculate otherwise.

In an article titled "Hope over Experience: Desirability and the
Persistence of Optimism," [a team of]{.underline} **[Yale
economists]{.underline}** [concluded that]{.underline} **[people's
desires direct them toward optimism]{.underline}** over and **[against
their so-called better judgment]{.underline}**. Alan [Greenspan
denounced the "irrational exuberance" and blamed it for the Asian
financial crisis in the 1990s]{.underline}. Through the work of queer
theorists like Lauren Berlant and Jasbir Puar, we can see that
**[capitalism thrives on the energy of this cruel
optimism]{.underline}**, [pathologizing it only when the market
collapses to save its idealized rational subject from
reproach.]{.underline}

Migrant Futures addresses counterfactual futures as they are imagined in
both apparent fictions---novels and films---as well as masked fictions
such as economic forecasts, founding documents of scientific consortia,
and development plans linked to structural adjustment loans. Rather than
using the latter as background to understand the former, Migrant Futures
places both types of extrapolative enterprises on an equal footing. Both
generate [cultural fictions]{.underline} that then [produce material
effects]{.underline}. If [financialization is a project that turns human
sentiment into data with the goal of]{.underline} **[predicting and
mitigating risk]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} **[wealthy
elites]{.underline}**, Migrant Futures focuses on the speculative
fictions of those populations shuttled in and out of zones of growth.
The [members of this undercommons refuse to participate in, and are
denied access to, the ladder of]{.underline} **[corporate
productivity]{.underline}** [and take comfort instead in forms of
**kinship and occupation that survive alongside and below the
radar**]{.underline} [of freewheeling global
entrepreneurialism]{.underline}. [**Their irrational exuberance**
serves]{.underline} them [well in the struggle to enact an alternative
economy of sharing amid destitution, love for others amid austerity, and
collaboration amid incentivized competition.]{.underline}

To think of **[migrant futures]{.underline}** is to posit that which may
never come to pass but **[must nevertheless persist speculatively,
against all odds]{.underline}**. Perhaps the primary function of their
existence is [to]{.underline} **[hold open the aperture to the
beyond]{.underline}**, [where the systems that seemingly dominate cease
to overwhelm]{.underline}. The cultural texts assembled in this book
explore a sense of wonder **[that exceeds]{.underline}** or runs
parallel to **[frameworks of the knowable]{.underline}**. [These
speculations]{.underline} from below face uncertainty with exuberance,
[dar]{.underline}ing [to stay open to chance, in part because that is
all they have, but also because they are]{.underline} **[no longer
playing the same game]{.underline}**. They have left the track.

Set in a dilapidated urban landscape, Malinky Robot revisits the primal
scene of techno-Orientalist fantasy: Tokyo. However, by focusing on
Tokyo's day-laboring district of San'ya, which remains home to Tokyo's
dispossessed, [Liew shifts the origin point of Japan's economic success
and underscores the vulnerability of those who were not folded into the
prosperity of global capitalism]{.underline}.38 Like the denizens of
Tokyo's San'ya, Oliver and Atari "eke out a life" in a geopolitical
context that works hard to eliminate them from the picture.39 Together
they scrape together bits and pieces of culture, currency, and materials
from the discarded matter of the city. "Eking out a life"---one of
Liew's favorite characterizations of Oliver and Atari's mode of engaging
with the world around them---resonates profoundly with Eve Kosofsky
Sedgwick's formulation of [reparative practices]{.underline}, which
illuminates "[the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting
sustenance from the objects of a culture---even of a culture whose
avowed desire has often been not to sustain them.]{.underline}"40
Sedgwick's [formulations of reparative versus paranoid modalities
distinguish between ways of experiencing time---within and beyond
narrative forms. Distinct from paranoid reading, which is motivated by
an attempt to inure oneself to potentially horrible futures, reparative
reading stays open and vulnerable to the radical possibilities of
surprise.]{.underline}41 Though called sequential art, comics as a
literary form have a propensity for bending time across the page,
wherein the space between panels---"the gutter"---could represent a
fleeting moment or eons of time passing, not necessarily in
chronological order. Malinky Robot flexes the possibilities of its
graphic form to capture play and adventure in slow time at a moment when
blockbuster films profit from ever more accelerated pacing. With sparse,
unspectacularized story lines that amount to "a robot walks home," or
"two kids borrow bikes to visit a friend," Liew's [utopian
visions---ephemeral and provisional---unfurl across the daily exploits
and mundane, communal acts of these unlikely heroes of the
future]{.underline}. Malinky Robot ruminates on [forms of idleness that
upend conceptions of wasted time, while simultaneously highlighting the
waste of capitalist overproduction]{.underline}. Whereas the [dystopian
tenor of techno-Orientalist cyberpunk and the breakneck ambition of
Future•Singapore both engender a paranoid relation to futurity by
manifesting either foreboding about or securitization of it, Malinky
Robot remains **remarkably open to surprise and radical
uncertainty**]{.underline}. In this way, **[it articulates a reparative
form of speculation---one that revels in the play of chance rather than
the taming of it]{.underline}**.42 Malinky Robot opens in 2024 atop a
skyscraper (figure 4.3), where sunrise finds the protagonists on top of
the world, not because they own or dominate it, but because they have
made the rooftop their makeshift shelter. Atari and Oliver are homeless,
making do with life in urban decay. Here, "mornings are . . . stinky!!"
(11). This is the surprising pronouncement that begins "Stinky Fish
Blues," the first story in the collection. At dawn, Oliver encounters
not the optimistic vista of sunlit horizons but the smell of a stagnant
city, littered with signs of broken technological promises. Yet morning
does bring surprising, if fleeting, moments of hope and unexpected
opportunity. Oliver and Atari go fishing at the docks and discover rare
life in the toxic waters---the nearly extinct Foetidus piscis (the
stinky fish), which has persisted despite barrels of industrial sludge
polluting its home. Their fortuitous catch fosters the hope of cashing
it in for reward, but the fish ultimately falls prey to a friend's more
pressing need to eat it. The kids are disappointed but not dejected, as
[prospects of cashing in recede to make allowances for the sharing of
life in this contingent community.]{.underline} [The stinky fish, living
beyond all probability in pernicious condtions]{.underline}, serves as a
fitting compatriot for Oliver and Atari, who [manage to do more than
just survive]{.underline} in a hostile environment. [They dare to have
dreams, foster friendships, and have adventures that actively extend the
possibilities of the living conditions allotted to them, even if their
dreams remain decidedly out of reach.]{.underline} Likely destined to
earn a living through tough, menial, and temporary work, Oliver and
Atari might entertain brief moments of hope, but the fantasy to fly is
not about ascendancy or mastery. The view from the top of Oliver's
transient skyscraper haven differs from what Michel de Certeau describes
in "Walking in the City." From the summit of the World Trade Center, de
Certeau experiences being "lifted out of the city's grasp. . . . When
one goes up there, he leaves behind the mass. . . . His elevation
transfigures him into a voyeur."43 But Oliver's prospects remain
decidedly unchanged by this perspectival shift. He remains
untransfigured, looking up like a homeless alien, not "looking down like
a god." This difference reverberates profoundly across the context of
Atari's and Oliver's likely futures working in the construction sites
that emblematize New Asia and its speculative building frenzy. Indeed,
when the two look upon a construction site, they consider their
curtailed set of opportunities, and even Oliver's act of momentary
ebullience ("I wanna fly a plane!") (figure 4.4) seems squelched as the
frame zooms out to capture the dwarfing effects of the world around him.
The tops of skyscrapers yield only visions of unattainable aspirations
and failed promises for Atari and Oliver, but they pursue adventure
nonetheless and find in an arcade a virtual realization of Oliver's
hopes to pilot a plane. In this closing frame of the story (figure 4.5),
[Liew leaves us with a stunning display of reparative practice, of
engaging in fleeting acts of pleasure to carve out alternative ways of
looking forward.]{.underline} Together, Atari and Oliver explore
alternative economies of exchange: they "borrow" bicycles that allow
them to visit their friend Misha across town. Their mundane push toward
collective ownership stands in stark contrast to the stealing-for-profit
story Misha shares with them over lunch at "McDonnell's" about Obiyashi
Takamashuru, an unscrupulous man who stole the design for cantilevered
gears on bikes from their mentor Mr. Bon Bon. This short vignette about
bicycle thievery turns sideways when it's revealed that bicycles
themselves carry with them another story of stolen property. As we learn
from Misha's tale, the bicycle---as concept, design, and mode of
transport---is always already stolen: the very mechanism that
facilitates its locomotion turns out to be a lifted idea. Framed as the
first in a series of comics within a comic, Misha's Ingrown Nale reveals
the history of the bicycle as property privatized and patented in the
shadiest of circumstances, throwing the world of propriety into ethical
question. Drawn in the heavily cross-grained and stridently scraggy
pen-and-ink style of graphic mavericks such as Robert Crumb, Ingrown
Nale (ostensibly produced from Misha's hand but of course also a
testament to Liew's creative range) takes the reader into Obiyashi's
demented world of ruthless corporate competition, greed, and dishonesty.
We follow Obiyashi to work on the day of his death and descent to a
Dante-inspired hell, where he confesses how he stole the design of the
cantilevered gear system. Though certainly incentivized to villainous
action, Obiyashi turns out to be a dupe, trapped in the promise of a
better future (figure 4.6). Before his fateful cardiac arrest, he
reflects on his situation: "30 years! My life, a series of dwindling
offices. I long for: the ocean, the trees, the breadth \[sic\] of my
children as yet unborn. Today, though, will be a day different from days
before" (45). We witness this corporate wonk's perpetually fruitless
drive toward upward mobility in several key details. Obiyashi's namesake
might ironically be Obayashi Global, the Japanese multinational
construction corporation behind the building of Tokyo Sky Tree, the
world's tallest broadcasting tower. Obiyashi's ascent in the corporate
elevator leads him to a dead-end cube of an office. In his futile
attempt to climb out of hell, he maniacally exclaims: "They gave me an
office! They gave me a car! And a hat to wear for when it got windy!"
(48). In these exclamations [we hear the despair wrought by this
subject's investments in "aspirational normativity]{.underline}":44 a
perpetually upskilled life, [heteronormative reproductive futurity, and
a drive toward individualistic achievement. Obiyashi has spent years
subjected to the "good life" logics of neoliberal capitalism---the
logics that rationalize financial and social speculations privileging
profit for the few over more disposable lives that don't fit or aspire
to the same narrative]{.underline}. The astonishing and inspiring
element of the Malinky Robot stories is their commitment to disarming
the seduction of neoliberal ascension and individualism in favor of
cultivating extended practices of care and more inclusive notions of
family and collective responsibility. In figure 4.7, we see Oliver's
comic strip embedded within the larger comic world of Malinky Robot.
"Hi-Life" features two construction workers on their lunch break,
sitting on a beam high up in a skyscraper, evocative of Charles Clyde
Ebbets's famous photograph, Lunch atop a Skyscraper, shot at New York
City's Rockefeller Center in 1932. In both examples, the drama revolves
around the precariousness of high-rise construction work. Without
harnesses, the workers seem alarmingly casual about their safety. Unlike
the Depression-era photo, though, the display of risk in Oliver's
version has not been staged by corporate interest to promote the
building of another Rockefeller skyscraper. Neither is the uncertainty
of a person's future contained by a narrative about the importance of
saving. Liew opts, instead, to stay with the awkwardness of uncertainty,
as one of the workers admits that he spends all his money on alcohol. In
Malinky Robot, a post--financial crash story, putting money in a savings
or interest-bearing retirement account might actually be more foolish
than squandering one's earnings on the pleasure of daily drinking. The
snippet demonstrates Liew's purposive undercutting of the "good life"
promise---a promise of better futures that the act of building
skyscrapers would seem to deliver. However, in Malinky Robot
technological inventions, whether in the form of skyscrapers or
cantilevered bike gears, fail to deliver on their promises. Oliver's
"Hi-Life" points to the irrelevance of whether these workers invest in
the future or not; it recasts the tale of opportunity as a farce for
those whom capitalism has deemed disposable, replaceable, and ultimately
without a future. Liew sabotages reproductive futurity in a similar
comic within a comic that plays on the popular children's magazine
activity of spotting the difference. Whereas a smiling child secures the
happiness of the family portrait in the first panel, a tombstone
supplants the child in the second and shatters the sunny disposition of
reproductive futurity. Shattered also is the very exercise of spotting
differences. These images make no pretense to similitude; with starkly
contrasting color palettes---the first is in bright, mostly primary,
colors, and the second is in macabre gray scale---spotting their
differences hardly requires practiced sleuthing or careful discernment
of the normal from the aberrant. Refusing to engage the familiar,
normative apparatus, Liew puts pressure on Highlights's slogan "fun with
a purpose."45 Oliver's morbid rendering of spotting differences
interrogates and dramatically halts the instrumentalization of fun. The
critique of instrumentalized fun stands in direct contrast to Oliver's
preference for "irrational exuberance" over edutainment's developmental
games, designed to put kids on the dubious cutting edge of competitively
tracked educational systems governed by quantitative evaluation and
techno-positivist entrepreneurs. In this way, Oliver's "Spot the
Difference" comic registers a complaint against what Lee Edelman has
termed "reproductive futurism,"46 a holding up of the figure of the
child as the naturalized site of political incitement. The fraught case
of imagining who shall inherit future Singapore, though, charts how
capitalist development and ecological sustainability hold the question
of reproduction and futurity in tension. Whereas a pronatalist movement
in the 1980s led to a baby-bonus program with financial incentives for
couples considering having second or third children, 1999 (on the heels
of the financial crash of 1997--98) marked the launch of Singapore's
international head-hunting program to recruit students and professionals
primarily from India and China.47 In 2001, the baby-bonus program was
reinstated, awarding mothers \$4,000 for each of the first two children
born and \$6,000 for the next two. More recently, at Singapore's 2008
National Day, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong dedicated more than 5,000
words of his speech to discussing the falling birth rate.48 Singapore's
concern over its low birth rate---among the lowest in the world---was
perhaps most overtly broadcast when a 2012 Mentos ad went viral, calling
for a National Night wherein Singaporeans would enact their "civic duty"
to make babies.49 Set to a song in which a male vocalist raps: "It's
National Night and I want a baby, boo, I know you want it, so duz the
sdu," the commercial refers to the Social Development Unit (renamed the
Social Development Network), a governmental body devoted to addressing
the low birth rate and housed under the broader reaching Ministry of
Social and Family Development. That state development includes such
calls to reproduction as civic duty situates Singaporean futurity not in
the figure of the child, but in actual children. The Mentos commercial,
in its unapologetic overture to heterosexual baby making, makes clear
the connections between reproductive futurity and other speculative
futures. National Night, according to the video, also means getting
aroused by the potential of buying a \$900 stroller and taking a stroll
through the Gardens by the Bay park---a billion-dollar, 103-acre public
construction project that even looks like a giant bubble of speculative
financing with all the aesthetic trappings of speculative futurity. It
is against these financial forms of irrational exuberance that Atari and
Oliver's flights of fancy and moments of ebullience stand in contrast.
Nevertheless, the exuberance Liew captures in his vibrant, dynamic, and
wiggling lines also distinguishes itself from the imaginary of austerity
and responsibility, marshaled by discourses of personal finance.50 In
another sidebar comic within a comic, Atari's imagined superhero Doctor
Midnight (Mr. Bon Bon in disguise) administers punishment to his foes
even as he spouts after-school specials' canned statements about health
and fitness. With each pow! krak! bif! blow to the thugs who have come
to claim the stolen bicycles, the doctor administers "medicine": "floss
after every meal!" "always wear your seat-belt!" and "Maintain an active
lifestyle!" (60). Doctor Midnight's recitation of sound-bites about
selfimprovement and healthy living as civic virtue is decidedly ironic.
For all of modern science's promises of its beneficial effects on the
population, these pledged benefits have passed over Oliver and Atari,
who seem wholly unmoved by overtures to longevity and prosperity. As the
sworn defender of street urchins, Doctor Midnight interrogates for whom
these logics of prolonging life are designed. After dispatching his
adversaries, he rebukes the thin assurances of better tomorrows: "[Who
builds the cities? By whose sweat, by whose blood?? And in return to ask
nothing but a roof over their heads. . . . Seeking merely to manage from
day to day . . . in these times of unending change . . . and in the
bitter end to shuffle into the darkness of this mortal coil that binds
us all. What is it that awaits us beyond that final frontier? What
indignities, what sorrows? What semblance of this hell that we have
already tasted on this cruel earth?"]{.underline} (61). The **[city of
the future does not provide a roof over the heads of those who built
it.]{.underline}** Oliver and Atari "manage from day to day" by
squatting in makeshift shelters either on rooftops or in abandoned
"McDonnell's" sites, making do with the materials of dilapidated
futurity. Doctor Midnight's closing monologue alludes to the oscillatory
quality of Hamlet's considerations "to be or not to be." The [allusion
helps illuminate the relationship between life and futurity---
"perchance to dream"---and insists on the importance of thinking of the
future as contested and critical terrain]{.underline}. [If they were to
buy into the aspirations of upward mobility and the gleaming promises of
Asian futurity, Oliver and Atari would partake in what Lauren Berlant
has called "cruel optimism."]{.underline} Berlant investigates "what
happens to [fantasies of the good life when the ordinary becomes a
landfill for overwhelming and impending crises of life-building and
expectation whose sheer volume so threatens what it has meant to 'have a
life' that adjustment seems like an accomplishment.]{.underline}"51 In
many ways, Malinky Robot sketches out [in]{.underline} haunting beauty
the condition of "living in crisis,"52 wherein we encounter Atari and
Oliver negotiating "[the impasse" of everyday crisis]{.underline} in
their temporary shelters and tender socialities.53 In Atari and Oliver's
daily exploits, [we find a sustained rumination on the caring
relationship between two truant geeks who aspire **"toward and beyond
survival," but in ways that move "toward an opening that does not
involve rehabituation, the invention of new normativities, or working
through and beyond trauma.**]{.underline}"54 Rather than eschewing Asian
futurity in the face of techno-Orientalism, Malinky Robot follows
Berlant's injunction "to imagine better economies of intimacy and
labor."55 Launched from within a "McDonnell's" where Atari and Oliver
have scored a free lunch from their friend Misha, this series of
embedded comics, which include Misha's story of the theft of Mr. Bon
Bon's intellectual property, Oliver's Sunday funnies about joblessness
and curtailed futures, and Atari's Doctor Midnight superhero comic,
allows incredible artistry and imaginative storytelling to unfurl
against the backdrop of Super size french fries and the multinational
reach of corporations like McDonald's. As the friends return to their
neighborhood on their borrowed bicycles, they run into Mr. Bon Bon,
whose backstory they've just learned over lunch. In the closing
full-page panel of "Bicycles," we see Bon Bon crouch to inspect the
cantilevered gear, the sign of all that could have been. But, as the
ordinary hero, Mr. Bon Bon simply asks if the kids are hungry and
suggests a new noodle place where they can eat, "his treat." [In the
cruel world of foreclosed opportunities]{.underline}, where Mr. Bon Bon
works construction even though his invention could have gained him
access to a life of financial security and relative comfort, [Liew's
story bears witness to the startling willingness to cultivate tender
ties in precarious times. Malinky Robot posits **an alternative to cruel
optimism**---call it a queer exuberance---that persists not only in the
queer kinships]{.underline} Misha, Atari, Oliver, and Mr. Bon Bon form
[amid conditions of contingency and precarity, but also in Liew's
ekphrastic exercise that restores texture to Asian futurity when
techno-Orientalism works to smooth over the vicissitudes of
neoliberalism.]{.underline} As Singapore relies increasingly on
temporary migrant workers, its flexible accumulation trades on the
cruelly optimistic drive toward a good life and the promise of an Asian
futurity that will never arrive for the vast majority of the workers who
sustain the wealth of the few. Malinky Robot imagines otherwise.

(Aimee, "Introduction: On Speculation Fiction, Finance, and Futurity" in
*Migrant Futures: Decolonizing Speculation in Financial Times*, Duke
University Press) //CHC-DS 🐱‍👤

This book puts into conversation speculative finance and speculative
fiction as two forms of extrapolative figuration that participate in the
cultural production of futurity. To put these two seemingly disparate
arenas of narrative production into conversation, I largely use the
methodologies of an emerging field that could be called critical finance
studies in conjunction with a longer standing field called feminist
science studies, which trained me to **[beware of]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} "**[god trick of seeing everything from
nowhere]{.underline}**" **[purveyed by the seemingly pure, objective
vision of scientific and capitalist realism]{.underline}**.6 [It is
indeed a god trick to get people to mistake prophecy for truth, notional
figure for value, or futurity for the future]{.underline}.
[As]{.underline} a lifetime student of [the power of narrative
to]{.underline} **[alter reality]{.underline}**, or at least perceptions
of it, I have often been awed by fiction's nearly magical actuarial
potency. By approaching both speculative finance and speculative fiction
as narrative productions, I emphasize the performativity of economics
and therefore the potential power of the literary imagination to call
forth new political economies, ways of living, and alternative
relational structures; and different sorts of subjects into the world.

I use the term "futurity" to highlight the construction of the future
and denaturalize its singularity, while maintaining an emphasis on how
[narrative constructions of the future play a significant role in
materializing the present]{.underline}. "Extrapolation," for example, is
the name for the mathematical modeling practice economists use to
predict future commodity prices and investment trends based on data
compiled in databases such as the crb Commodity Yearbook, Wharton
Research Data Services, as well as Global Financial Data Solutions. At
the same time, science fiction studies might first associate
extrapolation with the eponymous academic journal, which publishes
scholarly essays on science fiction (also called extrapolative or
speculative fiction). Migrant Futures investigates how [we narrate
futurity across various platforms, from speculative fiction to financial
speculation]{.underline}. How do [our stories of the future chart the
ways we **invest---**]{.underline}financially, **[politically,
ideologically, and intellectually---in the present]{.underline}**? How
do the [logics of preemption break across the shores of]{.underline}
financial **[securitization, military preparedness, and scientific
projection]{.underline}**? These are some of the questions taken up by
anthropologists, sociologists, historians, cultural theorists, and other
scholars contributing to an interdisciplinary examination of
financialization.7

Most notably, Edward LiPuma and Benjamin Lee assert the social
construction of financial derivatives---a [social
construction]{.underline} that, [like race]{.underline}, nonetheless
[has profound material effects on people's livelihoods, state politics,
and international conflicts]{.underline}. LiPuma and Lee call
derivatives ["socially imaginary objects"]{.underline} and
[assert]{.underline} "the social construction of the various types of
derivatives."8 They also emphasize the "**[abstract symbolic
violence]{.underline}**" [that speculative capital wreaks on the
world]{.underline}---"symbolic in the sense that it is not accomplished
physically by means of military force or colonialism, though it may, of
course, engender the conditions (such as impoverishment) that
precipitate violent crime and warfare" and "[abstract in the sense that
it never appears directly; rather it mediates and stands behind local
realities]{.underline}---such as interest rates, food costs, and the
price of petroleum."9 One poignant example that LiPuma and Lee provide
is the effect of presidential elections on the global economy. In the
case of the 2002 Brazilian presidential election, for example, when Luiz
Inácio Lula da Silva of the Worker's Party was projected to win, "the
principal players in the Latin American financial markets started to
sell and short the Brazilian currency."10 Electoral projections produced
economic reality. As Migrant Futures headed into the final stages of
production, the United States has witnessed the election of Donald Trump
as its president. On the evening of November 8, 2016, as people watched
the results come in, they also noted the Dow Jones falling
precipitously. By morning, though, markets seemed to have leveled out,
and the futures markets in U.S. Steel and private prisons in particular
were looking quite good, indeed. This last example, when read through
the burgeoning body of critical work in prison abolition movements,
yokes the abstract violence of finance capitalism to more overt
manifestations of state violence as exacted through the police force
disproportionately on black and brown, queer and trans bodies in the
United States.

**[Predicated on prediction]{.underline}**, the [algorithmic
models]{.underline} used in the financial sector as well as by insurance
companies often [count on the movements of]{.underline} **[legible and
calculable subjects]{.underline}**. Financial
**[speculation]{.underline}**, **[extrapolation]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[prediction]{.underline}** [rely on]{.underline}
mathematical models [and probabilistic logics to transform quantitative
data into a]{.underline} **[narrative arc]{.underline}**. By plotting
points along a line on a graph and deriving meaning from those data,
these [narratives require a rendering of a trajectory]{.underline}.
Though that rendering often takes shape in the visual field of graphic
representation, financial [forecasters produce]{.underline}
**[extrapolative fiction]{.underline}** [when they functionally convert
data into an interpretive arc, to be articulated and
narrativized]{.underline} in and beyond the graphic form. Econometrics
extrapolates from data collected by the University of Michigan Consumer
Sentiment Index and Index of Consumer Expectations, for example, which
reduce sentiment and expectation to numeric values in an attempt to
measure and then advise [for or against hedging uncertain
futures]{.underline}. This "**[datafication]{.underline}**" [is also
a]{.underline} **[rendering of data into fiction]{.underline}** or
statistical narrative, which Kathleen Woodward has characterized [as
"the preeminent expression of late capitalism."]{.underline}11 Financial
speculation produces a kind of speculative fiction, and despite its
overtures to fact over fiction, [it both contributes to and is affected
by a broader cultural production of futurity]{.underline}. By reading
the social construction of financial derivatives alongside more readily
recognizable forms of speculative fiction, [Migrant Futures asks if
another mode of speculation is possible, one that is not immediately
captured by the anxious gatherings of risk]{.underline}.12 If finance
is, as Max Haiven characterizes it, "capitalism's imagination," wherein
neoliberal financialization "comes at the expense of the radical
imagination," I locate [a primary site of]{.underline} **[radical
imagination]{.underline}** [in migrant futures that shift the site of
emergency away from **terror** toward deportation, attend to alternative
pockets of wonder such as feminist fabulation rather than]{.underline}
[**defense strategy think tanks**,]{.underline} [and speculate worlds
that **demand new onto-epistemological ways of being and
thinking**]{.underline}.

[Launching this examination are fundamental questions about]{.underline}
**[who narrates these futurities]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[what kinds of subject positions play out]{.underline}** [in these
projected temporal landscapes]{.underline}. Implicitly, [the
project]{.underline} **[interrogates]{.underline}** [who stands to
profit from and]{.underline} **[who risks extinction]{.underline}** [in
prevailing narratives about the future]{.underline}. The principal
players in the derivatives markets are multinational corporations,
international agencies such as the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank, investment banks, and hedge funds that pool the investments of
wealthy clients---basically, everyone but individuals and nations.13 The
funds of the four largest U.S. participants---JPMorgan Chase, Citibank,
Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs---represent more than 30 percent of
the total global derivatives market.14 Furthermore, the fundamental
governance of the global financial system has been dominated entirely by
U.S. and European economic interests, though countries with clearly
emerging market economies, such as China, India, and Brazil, have
demanded a seat at the rule-making table.15 The financial [colonization
of the future builds on preexisting disparities of wealth]{.underline}
held over [from]{.underline} earlier [histories of empire and
neocolonial enterprises that break at the fault line between what has
been called the **Global North and South**]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, mass [migrations of the undocumented, unbanked, and
state-less workers move in and out of geopolitical spaces, the nuances
and histories of their displacement and precarity **flattened by
statistical aggregation**]{.underline}. They are [migrant noncitizens,
outliers]{.underline}, most of whom hail [from the Global
South]{.underline} and have slipp[ed beyond even "dividual" statistical
legibility]{.underline}.16 **[In the calculus of risk]{.underline}**,
[the unmeasurable uncertainty of this statistical undercommons
generates]{.underline} some friction, some [disruption of]{.underline}
the would-be-unflappable [promises of **securitization**]{.underline}.
The economist Frank Knight, in his interrogation of risk, distinguishes
calculable probability (risk) from the "absolute unpredictability of
things" (true uncertainty).17 In the risk-uncertainty dialectic, [sheer
uncertainty invites profit seekers to convert profoundly unknowable
states into probabilistic forecasts, to fold uncertainty back into risk
practices---yet]{.underline} **[uncertainty cuts loose from risk
discourse's capture]{.underline}**, [eluding containment and
quantification]{.underline}. While true uncertainty might [refuse the
grid of intelligibility that securitization would foist upon
it,]{.underline} it remains **[knowable as lived
experience]{.underline}**, felt and negotiated perhaps most profoundly
by those held in "the waiting-room of history." As he describes this
imaginary waiting room in Provincializing Europe, Dipesh Chakrabarty
suggests that the "modern, European idea of history. . . came to
non-European peoples in the 19th century as somebody's way of saying
'not yet' to somebody else."18 In the context of finance capitalism,
though, the [inhabitants]{.underline} of the waiting room are in fact
[being written out of the future]{.underline}. What would it mean to
reconfigure that marginalization from European notions of progress,
modernity, history, and futurity? [What alternative futurities emerge
from those living beyond the purview of statistical
projection?]{.underline}

If the abstraction of populations into calculated risks and algorithmic
approximations of lived experiences produces for state and international
regulatory institutions "a legible and administratively convenient
format,"19 queer and trans theorists have been particularly helpful in
thinking through a politics that does not simply demand inclusion in
that system. A 2015 special issue of Transgender Studies Quarterly, for
example, takes aim at the "imperative to be counted," which becomes
"another form of normativizing violence that trans subjects can
encounter."20 Census Bureau and National Health Statistics data that
feed U.S. biopolitical regimes of population regulation work to
regularize a population and "flatten its zoetic confusions of movement
and form, of time and space, of doing and being, into neat
two-dimensional axes specifying static properties and numbers."21
Population regulation and public health discourse, insofar as they share
statistical methods with financial models of speculating on risk, could
very well move toward three-dimensional models using differential
geometry and statistical mechanics to predict volatility.22 But no
matter how nuanced and complex the models get, Paisley Currah and Susan
Stryker's provocation to consider how trans disrupts configurations of
"statistical citizenship" opens up a queering of speculation and perhaps
even a queering of statistical data as numerical or categorical,
discrete or continuous, nominal or ordinal.23 By "queering speculation,"
I refer to a host of reconfigurations of our relationships to the
"financialization of daily life" and the manifestation of a "risk
society"---which is to say a normative investment in quantitative data
to project futurity.24

When José Muñoz asserts that "the future is queerness's domain," he
posits a horizon of potentiality. Though that horizon might invoke
Martin Heidegger's Being and Time and therefore asks us to contend with
Heidegger's Nazism, Muñoz's articulation of a not yet draws more
compellingly not only on Giorgio Agamben's formulation but also on Ernst
Bloch's theorization of indeterminacy. Muñoz's presentation of the not
yet of queer futurity suggests a way to seize the not yet of European
historicity as described in Chakrabarty's waiting-room scenario. In
Muñoz's words, "we are left waiting but vigilant in our desire for
another time that is not yet here." Queer futurity offers a model for
transforming the waiting room into a horizon. As it moves through
examples of queer art, performance, and other queer utopian expressions,
Muñoz's Cruising Utopia looks to the realm of the open-ended gesture as
an alternative to the way other forms of speculation attempt to pull
that horizon of the future into the present for profit.25

By [enjambing]{.underline} these [two formulations of the not yet---one
that seeks to illuminate histories of empire and exclusion, and another
that insists on futurity as an opening up rather than a closing
down---]{.underline}I want to consider the relationship between the
waiting room and the horizon. For [it is precisely in the
exile's]{.underline} **[relation to time]{.underline}**---[the point at
which one is pushed out of]{.underline} what could be called [straight
time, settler time, or]{.underline} the [profitable time]{.underline} of
compound interest[---that one can glimpse the horizon of the not
yet]{.underline}, where not yet manifests itself not as a decree of
foreclosure but [as an]{.underline} **[embrace of the
unknown]{.underline}**. Building on the work of C. L. R. James, Muñoz
writes: "To call for this notion of the future in the present is [to
summon a refunctioned notion of utopia in the service of subaltern
politics]{.underline}."26

In an essay called "Angels in Digital Armor: Technoculture and Terror
Management" (2010), media scholar Marcel O'Gorman argues that **[notions
of heroism]{.underline}** [in contemporary technoculture aim to satisfy
two primary]{.underline} **[existential needs]{.underline}**:
[the]{.underline} **[desire for recognition and the denial of
death]{.underline}**. Most video games interpellate players by
reinforcing ideologies that underpin the sovereign subject, who believes
herself to be immortal and master of the world represented on the
computer screen. Gaming is one part of a broadly conceived digital
technoculture for O'Gorman. Appropriating Bernard Stiegler's thesis that
[the technologization of culture is linked to]{.underline} **[profound
malaise]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[ontological
indifference]{.underline}**, O'Gorman argues that online [heroism,
constituted through attention garnered]{.underline} on Facebook,
YouTube, and the news media, [goes hand in hand with the]{.underline}
**[disavowal of mortality]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[finitude]{.underline}**. Toward this O'Gorman analyzes cases of gamer
death in China and Korea, the Columbine High School shootings, and Cho
Seung-Hui, the Virginia Tech shooter, as "explicitly technological, or
even 'cyber,' because they involve the perpetrators' use of media to
rehearse or to promote their exploits in a desperate plea for
recognition" (O'Gorman). He does not discuss race explicitly but implies
that all users of digital media are somehow implicated.

While we agree with O'Gorman's diagnosis of the culture of online
celebrity and the proliferation of technically induced malaise, his
analysis runs the danger of overgeneralization with the blanket term
"technoculture." We would like to attend to the specificity of video
gaming and its Orientalist figuration by isolating a mechanic of
StarCraft that is common to most video games: the acquisition of
capital. More specifically, for the remainder of the essay we further
interrogate the relationship between work and play. While drawing from
McKenzie Wark's Gamer Theory and key game play mechanics from StarCraft,
we argue that extreme video [gaming may be read to]{.underline}
**[challenge]{.underline}** the **[presuppositions]{.underline}** [that
deem it]{.underline} **["unproductive"]{.underline}**
[labor]{.underline}. In doing so, we argue that **[extreme gaming upends
notions of capitalist time, pointing to ontological aporias that blur
the distinction between Occidental and Oriental]{.underline}**.

[Playing]{.underline} StarCraft [teaches its players about life outside
of the game]{.underline}, a testament perhaps to its broader relevance,
[training them to become better capitalists]{.underline}. Because of the
cutthroat level of competition and the constant influx of new talent,
professional gamers in Korea mostly enjoy short careers that are
abbreviated by mandatory military service. After being discharged from
the military, pro gamer Lee Joong Heon was employed at a video game
company. But after a five-year retirement, Lee, formerly a Warcraft III
player, decided to return to eSports and made the transition to
StarCraft II. In a 2009 interview, Lee relates that his return is
temporary and that he will retire again in three years. A job in a
trading company is lined up for him once he is done gaming
professionally (Yong-woo Kim). In a parallel career move, pro gamer Seo
Jihoon found a position as a sports marketer with the Korean
conglomerate CJ Group once he retired from StarCraft. A book published
in 2000 in the wake of the financial crisis called Starcnomics connects
StarCraft and its game play mechanics to the business world (Tae-heung
Kim; Hee-jong Kang). The parallel between the logic of gaming and
business may be evidenced in the United States as well. The University
of Florida has offered a class on "21st Century Skills in StarCraft,"
while the University of California, Berkeley campus has competitive
StarCraft courses. Playing StarCraft teaches one to become better at
life within capitalism.

These examples illustrate that StarCraft is not merely a form of play;
instead, [much of the "play" within the game could be considered a form
of work]{.underline}. Unlike many video games, the player does not
control an avatar or an in-game virtual representative (usually the main
character of a narrative). In StarCraft and many RTS games, [the player
assumes a **godlike overseer**]{.underline}/ manager position [with an
isometric view]{.underline} of the battlefield. At the start of a
session, the player can see and control his or her base, [with the rest
of the map,]{.underline} in the bottom-left corner of the screen,
[obscured by a]{.underline} **["fog of war."]{.underline}** If the
player clicks on parts of the map past his or her base, the view is
hidden in blackness until it is traversed by one of the player's
military units. The player knows only two things: how large the map is
and that an enemy is located somewhere. [As in]{.underline} **[cognitive
mapping]{.underline}**, [the player wishes to lift the fog of
war]{.underline} to chart out the playing area [and]{.underline}
**[master the space]{.underline}**. The player does not engage the enemy
immediately, for he or she must first build up forces in preparation for
it. And [in order to prepare, the player must acquire and manage
resources, like the capitalist in life outside the game.]{.underline}

Thus despite its twenty-fifth-century settings, [game play]{.underline}
in StarCraft [proceeds with twentieth-century]{.underline} **[late
capitalistic assumptions]{.underline}**. At the start of each game, the
player is given a central base, four worker units, and start-up capital.
With these resources, the player constructs more buildings such as
barracks, factories, gateways, and spawning pools in order to recruit
more workers, build new structures, and produce new military units. The
worker units acquire vespene gas (a resource only found in the game)
from geysers and harvest minerals from the environment. The barracks
train an array of offensive and defensive military units, each with
particular modes of movement and attack patterns. Oftentimes preparation
for battle---and the battle itself---can take only minutes or an hour
and more, and the player is forced to make most of these crucial moments
by planning ahead, making quick decisions, and moving rapidly. The
thrill of engaging the enemy must be preceded by this tedious labor,
which is squandered when the player's units are destroyed in combat. As
such, [the aim of producing only in order to]{.underline} **[destroy and
be destroyed]{.underline}** [aligns]{.underline} StarCraft with
[something akin to]{.underline} **[building a sand
castle]{.underline}**. **[The pleasure of constructing a sand castle is
embodied in the labor utilized to build something
ephemeral]{.underline}**. [Within capitalism, this ephemerality is
obscured by the ideological belief that tedious labor is productive
labor]{.underline}, yet [management within StarCraft brings the basic
ephemerality of capital itself to the fore]{.underline}.

In Gamer Theory, McKenzie Wark breaks down the distinction between the
real world and the illusory world of the video game. He coins the term
"gamespace" to signify not the virtual realm depicted on a screen, but a
physically placeless realm where the logic of gaming, including
quantitative modes of human valuation such as the "lifebar," indicated
underneath each unit, underpins lived existence. In contrast to Johan
Huizinga's famous definition of play as "a stepping out of 'real' life
into a temporary sphere of activity with a disposition all of its own,"
for Wark [playing]{.underline} video [games is coextensive with the
human operation of hardware and software in our contemporary postFordist
economy]{.underline} (26). "**[Games]{.underline}** are not
representations of this world," Wark writes, "they **[are]{.underline}**
more like **[allegories of a world made over as gamespace. They encode
the abstract principles upon which decisions about the realness of this
or that world are now decided]{.underline}**" (20).
[Considered]{.underline} **[within the logic of late
capitalism]{.underline}**, [gamespace quickly takes on a holistic
aspect, for it also describes the total administration of human activity
outside the video game, while perpetuating the ideology that the game is
nevertheless predicated on the "fair fight" and the maintenance of a
"level playing field."]{.underline} Gamespace **[overlaps with the space
of the neoliberal, global economy]{.underline}**. For Wark, a critical
theory of video games begins by [taking **outside reality** not as the
model to which games should aspire, but itself **as** "**a gamespace
that appears as an imperfect form of the computer game**"]{.underline}
(22).

As Wark dismantles the binary between reality and game, other
distinctions are implicated. Specifically, if [gamespace describes
an]{.underline} **[existential condition]{.underline}** [in late
capitalism]{.underline}, and if the mechanics of reward and punishment
operative in video games allegorizes an identical mechanics in
contemporary lived life, then Wark's deconstruction necessarily [carries
similar implications for the distinction between work and
play.]{.underline} While in an earlier era of capitalist development
such a distinction structured [what Marx called]{.underline}
**["species-being,"]{.underline}** [as well as productive and
unproductive activity]{.underline}, in the age of video games work
becomes another form of play, and vice versa. [Gaming is a form of work,
but as of yet not everyone is paid to play]{.underline}.

The [**rules of fair play**]{.underline} in video [games and the
ideology of neoliberalism]{.underline} **[intersect]{.underline}**: [if
the player works hard, the player's efforts will be acknowledged and the
work compensated]{.underline}. Most video games are motivated by this
reward dynamic through the [achievement of a high score]{.underline} or
the acquisition of coveted items and money, both of which [correspond to
the acquisition of capital in the nonvirtual space]{.underline}. Endless
acquisition in gamespace is particularly pronounced in the practice of
"gold farming," widespread in China. Gold farmers play for hours
acquiring virtual capital in MMORPG games such as World of Warcraft in
order to sell it for real capital (Vincent). Yet through this,
**[traditional ontological distinctions]{.underline}** [between gaming
and the actual world are radically confused]{.underline}. Approaching
online RPGs as an economist, Edward Castronova describes the relatively
[banal "economics of fun"]{.underline} that [underpin the synthetic
world of games. "**The economy is in fact an integral part of the
fantasy**,"]{.underline} Castronova writes. "**[Nothing makes a world
feel more alive than an active market system]{.underline}**" (172). Gold
farming, the most laborious form of [contemporary video gaming in the
neoliberal economy]{.underline}, **[troubles Western capitalist
notions]{.underline}** [of work and play by bringing tedium into
play]{.underline}. It is thus perhaps not a surprise that certain
journalists express disdain for professional video gaming and with the
idea of eSports: for them, video games belong to the realm of leisure,
sitting for hours being unproductive, and are not supposed to be
laborious.

Yet in this, StarCraft offers peculiar problems. StarCraft provides
abundant financial reward, especially for professional gamers, who are
among the highest paid in Korean eSports, but its game play does not
depend on conventional systems of reward. In-game capital provides
player satisfaction in most games. However in StarCraft, since in-game
capital is ephemeral, the player has only his or her professional
record. This is contrary to other games where gamers have something "to
show," such as a powerful avatar with the capital, commodities, and
experience to signify the labor and time put into the game. In StarCraft
the only record of total labor time is the players' IDs with their
career wins and losses. The point of StarCraft is not to accumulate
resources, but to use them as efficiently as possible before the match
is over. In-game resources such as minerals and vespene gas imitate the
exchange value of money in order to produce more buildings and units,
but there is no long-term merit to the production of surplus value
beyond the length of the individual match. Unlike in gold farming,
accumulated capital retains no exchange value. Instead, resources have
use value insofar as they become mobilized to defeat the enemy. Seen
from the perspective of gamespace, [the conditions of the]{.underline}
professional StarCraft [player imitate those of temporary capitalist
labor, but the player's activity also reveals the]{.underline}
**[virtual ontology]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[short-term
orientation of capital itself]{.underline}**. The management of minerals
and vespene gas in many ways allegorizes the management of virtual funds
for short-term, liquid markets in the shadow banking system.

If games create environments where gamers, regardless of their identity,
compete in "fair play," then extreme gamers push its limits by playing
harder than everyone else. The [morbid fascination in gamers who play
themselves to death then threatens to expose an older ideological
assumption that underpins this very interest: that human activity may be
divided cleanly between unproductive leisure and productive
labor]{.underline}. Despite the claim that postindustrial economies have
unilaterally dissolved the boundary between leisure and labor, **[within
techno-Orientalism]{.underline}** [this ideological remnant of the
industrial economy reinscribes the division]{.underline}. **[Asian gamer
death then remains ambivalent]{.underline}**, [for it]{.underline}
**[blurs the discursive boundaries]{.underline}** [that underpin the
gamespace of contemporary capitalism while]{.underline} **[taking the
logic of life in neoliberalism to its limit]{.underline}**. [The
threatened subject of the neoliberal economy must subsequently
underscore the real historical specificities that persist between
cultures and reconstitute them on the level of ontology]{.underline}.
The Western gamer then, like that depicted in Sony's commercial,
believes that he or she can stay on top without having to compete with
the rising Asian economies. [Such differences are all too often
understood within the tropes of racism and technology:]{.underline}
**[Asians are chained to their computers]{.underline}** through their
addiction to StarCraft, **[while the West remains]{.underline}**
essentially **[free]{.underline}**, having a much more "healthy"
relationship to video games. However, our analysis of gaming and capital
suggests that [all users are implicated in the logic of
gamespace]{.underline}.

[The dream of "never stop playing," like the mystifications of
Orientalism, reflects not the truth of the exotic Other]{.underline}, or
the transgressive possibilities opened up by purchasing a PlayStation
Vita, [but the]{.underline} **[narcissism of the capitalist
subject]{.underline}**. [The dream of gaming endlessly reflects the
dream of the hip gamer who never has to work, while the Asian gamer, who
dies from playing, points to a]{.underline} **[fundamental
aporia]{.underline}** [that subtends the binary between]{.underline}
work and play, and between **[self and exotic other]{.underline}**. As
Alexander R. Galloway puts it in his book The Interface Effect, "We are
all gold farmers" (136). [This thought]{.underline} **[troubles binaries
of life]{.underline}** [in industrial capitalism by which we understand
value and productivity in modernity]{.underline}. In this, the Asian
gamer may be thought of as "ahead" of the West in terms of the
development of the neoliberal economy. [Reinstating racial binaries
functions as a bulwark against the deconstruction of life (which should
be productive in capitalism) and death (which is often considered
unproductive), as well as against the anxiety this deconstruction
produces.]{.underline} **[Fetishizing Asian gamer death]{.underline}**
[and the Asian work ethic performs the]{.underline} **[work of
disavowal]{.underline}**, disavowal [of the fundamental differences that
persist between self and other, while attempting to mediate non-Western
modes of capitalist productivity]{.underline}.

When Blizzard released StarCraft II in 2010, eAthletes immediately
embraced the new installment. Professional leagues sprouted up, and in
May 2012 both OnGameNet (the most prestigious StarCraft league) and the
Korean eSports Association announced that they would be making the
official transition to StarCraft II (TeamLiquid). Lim Yo-hwan, the
player most synonymous with StarCraft, also retired from StarCraft:
Brood War to begin playing StarCraft II, a move so significant that a
documentary titled Lim Yo-hwan's Wings was produced (Ho-kyung Choi). The
industry was able to migrate quickly because of the similarity of the
mechanics between StarCraft and StarCraft II. And thus like its
predecessor, StarCraft II may be read [to problematize the binary
between work and play outside the game, as well as imaginations of
Occident and Orient]{.underline}. It also makes apparent the quick turns
in the cutthroat Internet gaming milieu that characterizes much of East
Asia [and brings to the fore the culmination of capitalist
logic]{.underline}. This is the very same mechanism that cycles
eAthletes, while leaving young men, and the occasional young woman, dead
in PC bangs just as quickly as it promotes them to national heroes.
While these gamers perish in their quest to never stop playing, [the
death of the Asian gamer will be appropriated within the geopolitics of
labor in Asia]{.underline}---unless, of course, video gaming is allowed
to transcend reified notions of play.

### FW\-\--Racializing Logics

#### The form of debate that calls us to "adhere to the rules" instates a subject that reproduces and rewards subjects who adhere to racializing logics built into the game.

The possibilities are numerous, yet my interests here gravitate more
specifically towards the emerging discourse on video games, the most
lucrative entertainment industry in the world today. My previous
analysis of films---especially Ghost in the Shell---has demonstrated the
importance of taking into account the nature of visual form, in addition
to narrative content, in shaping particular viewer interpretations.
[Paying attention to]{.underline} the [creative medium]{.underline}
itself [becomes especially important when we enter the realm of video
games, where **interactivity is one of the defining characteristics** of
game experience]{.underline}. While [any text, whether literary, visual,
or otherwise, arguably "interacts" with an active reader/viewer in some
way to produce meaning, video games offer unique challenges to how we
think about interacting with texts.]{.underline} Not discounting the
ongoing discussion regarding the role of narratology versus ludology in
video games studies (Juul 16), I aim to briefly highlight here the
medium's **[high level of interactivity as a significant area in which
racialization and gendering take place through mechanisms inherent to
video games]{.underline}**. I am therefore less interested in how
fiction or storytelling in games can Otherize---they certainly do---but
rather in how **[the underlying structures of video game mechanics do
so, perhaps as part of a larger conversation on the ideological mapping
of computer-mediated processes]{.underline}**. For my purposes, **[I
wish to call attention to the rule-based, outcome-oriented qualities
that govern most video games]{.underline}**; the fact that **[the player
is encouraged, compelled, or simply allowed to perform certain actions
in order to achieve certain outcomes is crucial to understanding how
video games exert cultural influence and (re)produce
ideology]{.underline}**. Ian Bogost's concept of procedural rhetoric is
useful here: distinct from the verbal or visual rhetoric that
accompanies more traditional forms of media, [procedural rhetoric as
often operating through digital systems designates the practice of using
processes such as game mechanics persuasively, where "arguments are not
made through the construction of words or images, but through the
authorship of rules of behavior, the construction of dynamic
models"]{.underline} (Bogost 29). Bogost contends that [video games that
effectively mount sophisticated procedural rhetoric can inform and
challenge players to reflect on how processes in the material world do,
can, or should work, thereby interrogating these material systems
themselves]{.underline} (Bogost 57). But even as I accept Bogost's
fundamental premise that video games utilize argumentative procedure to
great degree, I resist the suggestion that this procedure is necessarily
rhetorical in nature: [while players can indeed be persuaded to adopt
certain views, it is also likely that the same procedures can manipulate
or condition them into doing so.]{.underline} In other words, Bogost
fails to adequately address the extent to which pre-existing ideologies
may already naturalize, and thus reinforce, the very material processes
video game procedures can literalize or seemingly call into question.
Alexander Galloway has pointed out that [procedures in video games---or
what he calls "protocols"---can be viewed as allegories of control,
where, **through following and absorbing game rules that mirror the
politics of the informatic age, players are "learning, internalizing,
and becoming intimate with a massive, multipartite global
algorithm**]{.underline}" (Galloway 35). It is **[this more pernicious
effect of video game procedure that I highlight as a reinstantiation of
techno-Orientalism in new media.]{.underline}** Let us briefly consider
one example of a video game where this [tension between procedure and
allegory comes into play through racial Othering]{.underline}. While
Lucas Pope's 2013 independent game Papers, Please has garnered much
critical attention for its procedural sophistication in interrogating
the realities of immigration policy and authoritarian state violence,
his most recent detective game Return of the Obra Dinn (2018) utilizes
procedure in ways that are subtler and perhaps more troubling. On a
general level, Obra Dinn employs procedural mechanics common to the
detective genre's idealization of objective, intelligible, and
unmediated historical truths, such as by granting the detective means to
traverse time and space when unravelling the Obra Dinn's mystery;
however, here it is important to elaborate on how racialization
mechanisms are similarly woven into the structural pathways of the game.
Set aboard a fictional East India Company trade ship from 1802, the game
requires the player to investigate the fates of the Obra Dinn's 60 crew
members and passengers, who have all died or disappeared due to various
natural and supernatural causes. The player navigates in first-person
the complex layout of the monochromatic three-story ship with a magical
pocket watch, which allows them to return to specific moments before
each character's death to explore relevant audio and visual clues. Using
a roster and drawings of the crew, the player makes progress in the game
whenever they correctly determine and input character fates into their
inspector's logbook; with every three cases solved, they are able to
access more scenes and proceed further into the mystery. Even on a
narrative level, the game Orientalizes by relying heavily on a mystical
Formosan treasure chest as a central plot device: belonging to a group
of royal Formosan passengers, this exotic object is revealed to have set
in motion the endless tragedies on board, where, through some
unfathomable Oriental magic, hordes of "terrible beasts" of the sea are
lured in to attack the Obra Dinn. What calls for scrutiny is not just
how the plot of the mystery unfolds, however, but more importantly the
[procedural strategies of deduction players have at their disposal when
identifying characters and subsequently their]{.underline}
[fates]{.underline}. While more scrupulous or ambitious players may
meticulously look for conclusive clues embedded solely within the
narrative, such as by reconstructing timelines, analyzing character
relationships through dialogue, or tracking specific character items at
key locations, the game also offers a more freeform reasoning space in
which [external factors, such as profession or race, can be exploited
for processes of elimination.]{.underline} At more difficult stages
within the game where clues are scarce, one inevitably finds themselves
noticing the simplistically rendered, but unmistakably present,
racialized appearances of the characters, or the pronounced accents and
linguistic variation of the dialogue recordings replayed at each death.
Combined with the logbook's convenient catalogue of all character
origins, which include a variety of European and Asian nationalities,
these normative racial markers make it possible for the player to guess
character identities through trial and error, since the logbook
automatically progresses once any three correct fates are reached. For
instance, a player might assume a certain character to be Chinese based
on their appearance and/or accent; then, with two identifications
already entered into the logbook, the player could input all the Chinese
names given until one of them triggers a third correct response. The way
the game portrays individual racial appearance, accent, or
culture---whether "accurately" or otherwise---is irrelevant here; what
Bogostian procedure highlights are the [rule-based structural pathways
encoded in the game that permit racialization to work as a strategy in
the first place]{.underline}. Obra Dinn thus [motivates the player to
make the kind of racial generalizations---accent as natural index of
identity, ethnic features as justified means of racial and subsequently
social categorization, etc.]{.underline}---that Bogost anticipates such
a game to critique through procedure. Yet, [instead of using rhetoric to
expose the harm of racial Othering, the game cements their normative
nature;]{.underline} since [players are able to proceed in the game in
this way and uncover the "truth" of the mystery]{.underline}, Obra Dinn
[actually rewards them for engaging in these ideological practices, thus
further naturalizing the constructed logic of
racialization]{.underline}. This **[implicitly encoded notion of reward
is especially important]{.underline}** [when we reflect on Bogostian
procedure in terms of its argumentative qualities]{.underline}. [Unlike
language that aims to persuade through direct instruction or
explication]{.underline}, the **[procedures players are introduced
to]{.underline}** in video games like Obra Dinn **[are powerful tools by
which ideology is learned]{.underline}**, in the sense that **[players
internalize---through interacting first-hand with rules of the
game---processes that they themselves observe to be effective, often in
high-stakes settings]{.underline}**. In Obra Dinn's online community
forums, some players comment gleefully or in frustration about the fact
that they can use "brute force" logic to clear the game, while others
retort that this is not how the game is "supposed to be played." But
**[a singular or mandatory method for playing the game does not exist,
just as a singular method to interpret a text does not exist, and it is
precisely this possibility, this hidden logic, embedded in the game that
becomes critical to its treatment of racial ideology as
argument]{.underline}**. For Obra Dinn does not offer a puzzle in which
race does not exist or signify, nor does it explicitly satirize
racialization as its own procedural vice, as was perhaps done with
Papers, Please; instead, players encounter situations where
racialization, seemingly irrelevant, ultimately proves to be highly
effective once learned. Indeed, [racialization is deliberately made a
covert, intuitive, indeed algorithmic logic, much as how it operates in
the real world, and herein lies the argumentative, or "persuasive,"
power of digital procedure]{.underline}. [Whether]{.underline} it is the
[earlier forms of explicit racism seen in yellow-peril propaganda, or
the appropriation and depoliticization of race under the disguise of
postmodern aesthetics, or the increasingly common narratives of
post-racial dystopia featured in speculative fiction,]{.underline}
**[reinstantiations of Orientalism and techno-Orientalism continue to
define and surveille how Asians speak, act, and exist in both fictional
and real worlds]{.underline}**. Thinking back to Said's early concerns
with Orientalism's amorphous, self-adapting nature over time, **[it is
imperative that we pay close attention to the rapidly evolving
expressions of global media and continue to identify, resist, and
ultimately dismantle the various languages and spaces by which such
oppressive systems of Othering exist]{.underline}**. By examining the
nuanced constructions of the subject-object binary as manifest in the
Asian woman's ornamental objecthood, this thesis has hopefully taken a
step towards the critical discourse on reimagining gendered racial
ontologies to promote more productive and subversive understandings of
modern personhood.

Framed by comparative and postcolonial approaches to Asian American
studies, my approach to techno-Orientalism destabilizes the false
universality of the "human," that animating figure of speculative
fiction. In "The Intimacies of Four Continents" (2006), Lisa Lowe
locates [the modern "human" subject's nineteenth-century
emergence]{.underline}, which [normalized freedom, liberty, rights, and
progress, within the material conditions]{.underline} **[produced
through slavery, genocide, and indenture]{.underline}**. Critical
[analyses that affirm liberal categories like freedom, rights, and
progress forget that they]{.underline} **[arise]{.underline}** **[from
the]{.underline}** [exclusions, occlusions, and]{.underline}
**[deathliness of race]{.underline}**. [Race]{.underline} thus
[temporally marks an]{.underline} **[ontological
difference]{.underline}** [from the modern subject of liberal humanism;
to be nonwhite is to be out of sync with modernity]{.underline}. Within
this chronotopic definition of the "human," [the postmodern future of
techno-Orientialism has left the "human" and its modern
present]{.underline} of mercy and community [behind to become a
technocentric dystopia]{.underline}, while the decadent premodernity of
past-turning Orientalism leads "humanity" astray from its modern values
of discipline and order. Moreover, [outside of these time zones of the
"human" is the]{.underline} **[subjection of blackness]{.underline}**.
In Lisa Nakamura's analysis, [blackness in the digital age signifies
**techno-primitivism**]{.underline}, **[primitive
spirituality]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[laboring exchange
value]{.underline}**. Reading depictions of technology in multiracial
futures, Nakamura shows how [white heroism takes on moral power through
projections of Asianness and blackness: Asianness symbolizes a tool for
white success, while blackness---stuck in an unmodern
irrationality---legitimizes but never equals white valor]{.underline}
(Digitizing Race, 109, 116, 127--128). [These]{.underline}
**[figurations of time racialize liberal humanism's promise of freedom
as whiteness]{.underline}**; [the category of the "human" and its
appearance of universality disguise these structuring
exclusions.]{.underline}

To be clear, I love Joss Whedon and his dedication to human rights, seen
on-screen in the Whedonverse's thematic preoccupations and off-screen in
his support of international feminist organization Equality Now.
However, as Mimi Thi Nguyen contends, [the "human" of human rights
structurally depends on the inhuman violence spread in delivering its
promises of freedom]{.underline}. First, by naming race as this inhuman
remainder, I intervene in the field of Whedon studies. The incredulous
tone with which Eric Hung reviews this literature in "The Meaning of
'World Music' in Firefly" suggests how these [acafan analyses forgive
representational color-blindness, whitewashing, and racism beyond the
screen to praise the auteur]{.underline}; the Dollhouse special issue of
Slayage: The Journal of the Whedon Studies Association does not include
race in its vocabulary. [Focusing on race]{.underline} in the narratives
of the Whedonverse [introduces the inhumanity of the "human" as an
unresolved problematic of minoritized groups' struggle for
representation]{.underline}. Second, I take up [techno-Orientalism as a
relationally racializing trope]{.underline} in speculative fiction
[to]{.underline} illustrate [the]{.underline} nonequivalent
[co-construction of]{.underline} **[anti-Asian]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[antiblack racisms]{.underline}**. These
**[palimpsestic Orientalisms]{.underline}** are not a fiction to be
proven false, but [characterize the twentyfirst-century]{.underline}
**[anxieties of difference]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline} **[white
supremacist culture]{.underline}** from which Whedon writes; Asian
American expression or presence alone cannot correct these
interconnected racializations.

#### Asian American critique of their own involvement in domestic settlerism can be the basis of conjoining global decolonization movements to domestic deimperialization---the creation of futures beyond settlerism requires the production of new knowledges that attack the stress points of global empire---

process in any deimperialization movement]{.underline}, then [[what
**conditions need to be created in the United States to bring about an
effective movement**]{.mark} **there?**]{.underline} [[What **would the

Attwood Makanani, a cultural practitioner and voyager, once told me,
'You gotta haku', and I didn\'t understand what he meant. 'Haku' is the
term for braiding or composing something. And now I think I understand
that [Pacific peoples can take the most fragile fibers and weave them
into powerful ropes to bind homes together, canoes together, and even
move great objects through the forest. [Let us braid our struggles

(Kyle Kajihiro 2011) As essays in this volume of Inter-Asia Cultural
Studies examine the implications of Asian American studies in Asia, I
would like to open up this essay with a consideration of the fragile
fictions of US imperialism in Asia and the Pacific. On October 11, 2011,
US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton published an op-ed piece in Foreign
Policy on the necessity of aggressive military and economic advances in
the Asia-Pacific region. Entitled 'America\'s Pacific Century',
[Clinton\'s statement stakes a claim to the Pacific, opening with the
conditions of war in Iraq and a repositioning of US military forces from
Iraq and Afghanistan to Asia and the Pacific]{.underline}: As the war in
Iraq winds down and America begins to withdraw its forces from
Afghanistan, the United States stands at a pivot point. Over the last 10
years, we have allocated immense resources to those two theaters. In the
next 10 years, we need to be smart and systematic about where we invest
time and energy, so that we put ourselves in the best position to
sustain our leadership, secure our interests, and advance our values.
One of the most important tasks of American statecraft over the next
decade will therefore be to lock in a substantially increased
investment---diplomatic, economic, strategic, and otherwise---in the
Asia-Pacific region. (Clinton 2011) [Such a framing clearly articulates
the militarized theater necessary for the performance of US economic
policies. It is in the rhetoric of militarized capitalism that we see
the **nineteenth-century logic of US imperialism**: gunboat diplomacy
that forced open markets in Asia and the Pacific continues today as
Aegis warships enforce free trade.]{.underline} In this way, Clinton\'s
declaration prepared the ground for the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum of 21 nations in the Asia and Pacific regions
hosted by the United States in Honolulu, Hawai'i, in November 2011.
APEC\'s ostensible mission is 'championing free and open trade and
investments', but as critics like Walden Bello have argued, APEC is
being used by the United States to pull itself out of financial crisis,
particularly in furthering the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), formed
in reaction to the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA) that went into
effect in 2010 (Bello 2011). The TPP countries include the United
States, Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru and
Singapore with Japan, Indonesia, Russia and others as potential members.
As Bello (2011) explains, the TPP is viewed as a 'WTO-plus' because it
is even more stringent in its free trade rules than the World Trade
Organization (WTO): The objective of the original agreement was to
reduce all trade tariffs to zero by the year 2015. It now aims to be a
comprehensive agreement covering all the main pillars of a free trade
agreement, including trade in goods, rules of origin, trade remedies,
sanitary and phytosanitary standards, technical barriers to trade, trade
in services, intellectual property, government procurement, and
competition policy. As critics agree, [APEC\'s representation of
transnational interests has led to the deregulation of Asian and Pacific
economies that makes possible the exploitation of human and
environmental resources with devastating effects for indigenous peoples,
farming and fishing communities, workers, women and poverty-stricken
people in Asia and the Pacific.]{.underline} As the APEC leaders met at
the Hawai'i Convention Center, an alternative conference was held by Pua
Mohala i ka Pō and the International Forum on Globalization (IFG). The
Moana Nui 2011 (Peoples of the Asia/Pacific vs. APEC/TPP) conference
brought together activists from Hawai'i, Rapanui, the Philippines,
Guåhan/Guam, Okinawa, Aotearoa/New Zealand, the Marshall Islands, Palau,
Tonga, Fiji, Micronesia, Australia, Sāmoa, Siberia, Vanuatu, Malaysia,
South Korea, Japan and the United States. Invited speakers included
Native economists, farming and fishing practitioners, advocates for
political and economic sovereignty, globalization experts, experts on
the global land grab, specialists in media, public education,
environmental studies and law, and anti-bases movement activists. In
their description of the event, the coordinators of Moana Nui sent out a
call to the peoples of Asia and the Pacific to articulate their own
self-determining visions of a sustainable economic and political future:
Moana Nui is intended to provide a voice and possible direction for the
economies of Pacific Islands in the era of powerful transnational
corporations, global industrial expansion and global climate change.
This conference will issue a challenge to Pacific Island nations and
communities to look for cooperative ways to strengthen subsistence and
to protect cultural properties and natural resources. The timing of this
conference is intended to overlap the next meeting of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) in Honolulu and hopes to call public
attention to the critical importance of maintaining sound and productive
local economies in the Pacific Islands both for their own sake and food
security in the world. (Moana Nui 2011a) Against the fictions of free
trade, the most powerful note of consensus at the conference was that
traditional cultural practices that sustained indigenous peoples for
millennia are the most sustainable. These international gatherings
enable us to protect and promote those practices by piecing together our
local analyses for a clearer picture of the global operations of
interlinking forms of imperialisms, colonialisms, corporate capitalisms
and militarisms. [As anti-APEC and Moana Nui organizing and
demonstrations illustrated the fragile fictions of empires, it is **the
cumulative effect of these [deimperializing]{.mark} moments that [is
restructuring a future beyond empires]{.mark}**. The magnitude of this
[imperial, militarized capitalism is]{.mark} rendered as [a **global map
of stress points that cannot bear its inhumane
burdens**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Interlinked popular movements and
**their production of knowledge**]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [[become
like **bursts of**]{.mark} **runaway [voltage striking at these stress
points]{.mark}**. [Visions of the future **hinge upon the ideological
wars over the production of knowledge**, and]{.mark} these [insights
into the vulnerabilities of empires **enable**]{.mark} **us to chart
emergent formations and to map [new directions for Asian American
critical praxis]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As I contend in this essay,
[[the seemingly unassailable architecture of US empire is under erosion
from both within and without]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although Asian
American studies as a discipline was born out of the civil rights
movement and criticisms of imperialist wars being fought in Asia, Africa
and South America, Asian Americans later turned to delineating the
institutional parameters of Asian American studies, focusing on domestic
issues of racism in the United States and the 'claiming of America'. It
was in the 1990s that theorists in postcolonial studies and Third World
feminist studies raised questions about the artificial boundaries that
were being drawn in examinations of Asian American texts. Later [work on
the continuities between Asian American studies and the imperial and
colonial contexts of Asia was inspired by writers who traversed
international boundaries]{.underline}, including Chandra Mohanty (1988),
Trinh T. Minh-Ha (1989), E. San Juan, Jr. (1991a, 1991b, 1991c), Oscar
Campomanes (1992, 1995), Chungmoo Choi (1993), Lisa Lowe (1991, 1993),
and Inderpal Grewal (1994). Most recently, [texts]{.underline} such as
Setsu Shigematsu and Keith Camacho\'s (2010) edited collection
Militarized Currents: Toward a Decolonized Future in Asia and the
Pacific [have worked to connect the histories of Japanese and US empires
across Asia and the Pacific.]{.underline} On another register, [an
emergent form of Asian American critique challenges the presence of the
United States within its imagined borders]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark}
etymological [narrative that the United States is 'home' to Asian
American]{.mark} studie[s]{.mark} [is being **critically re-examined in
analyses of settler colonialism** ]{.mark}**and the US settler state\'s
assault on indigenous peoples, their land, and their state
sovereignty.**]{.underline} In the fall of 2000, Jonathan Okamura and I
co-edited a special issue of UCLA\'s Amerasia Journal entitled 'Whose
vision? Asian settler colonialism in Hawai'i' (Fujikane and Okamura
2000), followed by an expanded collection, Asian Settler Colonialism:
From Local Governance to the Habits of Everyday Life in Hawai'i
(Fujikane and Okamura 2008). Kanaka 'Ōiwi

**[[foreground the genocidal operations of the US settler state and
raise critical questions for Asian Americans about their status as
settlers on indigenous lands]{.underline}]{.mark}**.1 As a
fourth-generation Japanese American settler in Hawai'i and co-editor of
the collection, [I describe Asian settler colonialism as a constellation
of the colonial ideologies and practices of Asian American settlers who
are part of the broader structure of the US settler state]{.underline}
(Fujikane 2008: 6).2 Asian settler colonialism refers to the present
participation of all Asian Americans in Hawai'i in US settler
colonialism through different kinds of settler practices, ranging from
colonial administration to the routines of everyday life. Asian American
settler contributors to those volumes illuminate aspects of Asian
settler colonialism from different fields and disciplines to illustrate
its diverse operations and material impact on Kānaka 'Ōiwi. [As those of
us who have critiqued Asian American settler colonialism have argued,
[an understanding of our positions as settlers]{.mark}]{.underline} in
Hawai'i and in the United States [[has become critical to
**reconceptualizing Asian American critique**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As
in poststructuralist work, [[the critique]{.mark} of Asian American
settler colonialism [asks us to enter into a more self-reflexive
inquiry]{.mark} about our positions both in relation to the US settler
state and to indigenous peoples. [Far from an essentializing move, the
critique]{.mark} of Asian American settler colonialism [invites us to
**investigate the complex ways that Asian Americans are implicated in
the settler colonial policies of the United States** and to **delineate
the** ]{.mark}**kind of [anticolonial and anti-imperial work that must
be done. ]{.mark}**]{.underline}The international workshop on 'Asian
American Studies in Asia' became a critical site of inquiry for me in
articulating the continuities between a critique of Asian American
settler colonialism and deimperialization in Asia. In thinking about
these questions, I was particularly struck by the kinds of critical
analyses Kuan-Hsing Chen makes in his call for a deimperialization of
both Asia and the United States. As Chen argues, **[[the study of Asia
as method alerts us to the possibilities of reorienting]{.mark} Asian
American [critique]{.mark} by using Asia as a reference point, [moving
beyond the imperial centers and imagining and engaging in post-imperial
practices inspired by different geopolitical
sites]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Chen writes, The implication of Asia as
method is that [using Asia as an imaginary anchoring point can allow
societies in Asia to become one another\'s reference points, so that
[the understanding of the self can be transformed, and subjectivity
rebuilt]{.mark}.]{.underline} Pushing the project one step further, [[it
becomes possible to imagine]{.mark} that historical experiences and
practices in Asia can be developed as [an alternative]{.mark} horizon,
[perspective, or method for posing a different set of questions about
world history]{.mark}.]{.underline} (Chen 2010: xv) In the quotation I
take as my first epigraph, [[Chen]{.mark} also [asks what methodologies
**can make deimperialization a reality**]{.mark} **in the neoimperial
center**]{.underline}. The question is derived from his concern that
'[the **collapse of the empire does not mean the collapse of the former
colonizing population\'s imperial consciousness'**]{.underline}, and he
cites Mutō Ichiyō\'s argument that [[critical **intellectuals must
assume the responsibilities for being accomplices to the crimes
committed by the imperial state** (]{.mark}Chen 2010: 206).
**[Only]{.mark} [in this way can deimperialization
occur]{.mark}.**]{.underline} I would argue that [[a critique of Asian
American settler colonialism constitutes one such methodology that
**mobilizes** ]{.mark}**a mode of [self-reflexive inquiry]{.mark} in
Asian American critique** [and **conjoins it to a decolonizing and
deimperializing movement in Asia and the United States**]{.mark}**.**
[It]{.mark} [is a methodology that calls upon]{.mark} us to re-examine
the settler colonial underpinnings of Asian American narratives and
praxis, underscoring the need for [Asian American settlers to challenge
settler colonialism in their own communities as well as in the
larger]{.mark} US [settler state.]{.mark} It is in **[tracing the
production of settler colonial knowledges]{.mark} that we [can expose
the operations by which Asian American settlers have participated in
obscuring]{.mark} the conditions of [US]{.mark} occupation,
[colonialism, and imperialism]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Only by achieving
justice for]{.underline} Kānaka 'Ōiwi and for [American Indians can we
as Asian American settlers liberate ourselves from our positions as
agents in a settler colonial system of violence. It is in this work that
**[I see a critique of Asian American settler colonialism broadening out
in shared affinities with the project of deimperializing
Asia.]{.mark}**]{.underline} This now brings me to a key argument about
Asian American studies in Asia: [[Asian American critique
**must**]{.mark} **engage in Asia and the Pacific as method**, to borrow
and extend Chen\'s argument, which means [reorient]{.mark}ing [ourselves
in **more expansive ways toward Asia and the Pacific in order to work
toward a decolonized, deimperialized future**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[This is not to say that we must abandon]{.underline}]{.mark} [our own
[important local or national analyses of racism, heteropatriarchy, class
struggle]{.mark}, or the relationships between indigenous peoples and
settlers, or the transnational flows of people and resources among
global sites]{.underline}. Instead, [[we can expand our work]{.mark}
simultaneously [in these different arenas and bring those critical
analyses together ]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[to show]{.mark} how globalization has an impact on Asian American
critique and also [that the **Asian American critique can be part of a
decolonizing and deimperializing force in Asia and the
Pacific.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The 1AC's analytic frame is necessary---slavery and anti-blackness are inadequate to understand and must be theorized in conjunction with settler colonialism as structuring modernity and constituting blackness

SPACE AND SETTLER COLONIAL LANDSCAPES", PhD Dissertation\]

We must consider that [[Settler colonialism shapes and constitutes Black
life]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[specifically slavery and its
afterlife]{.mark} in America.]{.underline}** [[While]{.mark}
[slavery]{.mark} and anti-Black racism [should be active]{.mark} and
robust analytic [frames]{.mark}]{.underline} that guide Black Studies
and help us understand Black subjectivity in the Western Hemisphere,
[[settler colonialism]{.mark} also [structures Black life]{.mark}. [The
genocide of Native peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the perpetual making
of Settler space]{.mark} and Settler subjectivity]{.underline}---as
unfettered self actualization---[[do not]{.mark} immediately [stop
existing]{.mark} as forms of power [when they run into Black
bodies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The way]{.mark} that [settler colonial
power looks]{.mark} and manifests itself **[just changes]{.mark};** **it
does not stop.**]{.underline} [Settler colonialism]{.underline}, as a
subjectless discourse, [is a form of productive power that touches all
that live in the US and Settler colonial nations]{.underline}.30 Though
it touches and shapes everyone's life it does so in very different ways.
For the purposes of my own research I am arguing that [[settler
colonialism's]{.mark} normalizing power enacts genocide against Native
peoples]{.underline} (disappears Native people) [but]{.underline} it
[also [shapes and structures antiBlack racism]{.mark}. The ontological
positions that were created by slavery,]{.underline} specifically the
Slave [are still alive and well]{.underline} however, **[[settler
colonial power]{.mark} intersects with, [works through and structures
the]{.mark} repressive and productive [power that makes the Black
captive]{.mark} [fungible and socially dead]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Throughout, In the Clearing poses the question, in what ways does
settler colonial power help structure slavery and anti-Black racism?
This project ultimately argues that **[[slavery and anti-Black racism
are not adequate to]{.mark} fully [understand the]{.mark} material and
discursive [processes that create Blackness in]{.mark} all of [its
embodied genres]{.mark} in North America]{.underline}**. [[Slavery and
anti-Black racism are]{.mark} also [not the only]{.mark} repressive
[powers that make the Black]{.mark} body [abject]{.mark}, fungible and
situated at the outer limits of being-ness]{.underline}. [[Both
**slavery and settler colonialism structure modernity and need to be
fully conceptualized**]{.mark} **as forms of power that help constitute
Blackness**. Conceptualizing the ways that settler colonialism and
slavery co-constitute one another is an essential component of this
dissertation.]{.underline}

#### Settlement, spatiality, and place must all be theorized as essential to the production of the "human" and the materialization of blackness as an ontological position---the process of settlement enables self-actualization by the Settler through the turning of blackness into a position of the settled-slave

**King 13**

\[2013, Tiffany Jeannette King, "IN THE CLEARING: BLACK FEMALE BODIES,
SPACE AND SETTLER COLONIAL LANDSCAPES", PhD Dissertation\]

This is not an appeal to expand the category of the settler, as I have
argued before Black slaves and descendants of slaves are not settlers.
However, [[the processes which make Black bodies fungible flesh]{.mark},
a form of terra nullius, [and embed their bodies]{.mark} in the land [as
settled-slaves **needs to be theorized as**]{.mark} **modalities of
[settlement]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Settlement needs to]{.mark} be
**[retheorized along the contours of]{.mark} the [bodies]{.mark} that
[it renders]{.mark} materially and socially
[dead]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Scholarship from Marxist geographies,
cultural landscape studies, anthropology and the emerging field of
settler colonial studies is useful for helping us think about space,
however, it does not help us think about the ways that [the process of
[settlement]{.mark}]{.underline} [**also [materializes Blackness as an
ontological position]{.mark}**. Native studies and Black studies enable
a discussion of how the production of Settler and Master or
Settler-Master subjectivity comes about due to its parasitic
relationship to Native death and Black
fungibility/accumulation]{.underline} (social death). [[When we think
about the Settler-Master]{.mark} as parasitic [we can]{.mark} also begin
to [think about **their process of settlement as one that**]{.mark}
**also [requires the]{.mark} [making of ontological categories occupied
by the dead]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The **process of [settlement allows
the]{.mark} [Settler-Master to become a human]{.mark} with spatial
coordinates because the Native dies and the Black becomes a
non-being**]{.underline} (a settled-slave).15 [[Settlement is **more
than**]{.mark} **transforming** the land. It is more than the
teleological process of weary [white people making a home and Native
people]{.mark} naturally [disappearing]{.mark} over time.]{.underline}
**[[Settlement is an assemblage of technologies and processes of makings
and unmakings]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Its processes require the
**making and unmaking of bodies, subject positions, space, place and
claims to various forms of autonomy, self actualization and
transcendence**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In Settler Colonialism: A
Theoretical Overview, Lorenzo [[Veracini]{.underline}]{.mark}, a
founding scholar of the emerging field of settler colonial studies
[[describes]{.mark} the process of [settlement as a process that enables
the "unfettered mobility" of the settler]{.mark}]{.underline}.16 While
abject others within settler colonial nations are "principally
characterized by restrained mobility" [the settler experiences the
capacity for "unfettered mobility]{.underline}." This description of the
kind of state of existence that settlement allows the settler is
instructive. While Veracini's description moves us closer to a
discussion of states of being, I want to reframe Veracini's description
and introduce a few more elements to the equation. Settlement as an
intricate, dynamic and contradictory relationship to Native bodies,
Black bodies and the land/nature. [[Settlement structures the Settler's
relationship to]{.mark} the Native, [the Black]{.mark} and nature
[as]{.mark} a relation of [negation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Settlement]{.mark} also [creates complex ontological positions]{.mark}
that are [constituted b]{.mark}y both [states of stasis and
flux]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} What I mean by this is that [some
bodies]{.underline} ([Native and Black) are relegated to a permanent
position of flux]{.underline}. [Native bodies are always slipping into
death, [Black bodies are always sliding into states of
fungibility]{.mark} and accumulation[. The flux and instability]{.mark}
of the Black and the Native **[enable the Settler to experience a self
actualizing]{.mark} [state of]{.mark} both [libratory stability and
transcendent autonomy]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [[The ontological
positions of the Native]{.mark} (slipping into death) [and the
Black]{.mark} (sliding into fungibility and accumulation) [are positions
of fixed-flux]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Wilderson argues [[these
positions do not occupy the universal]{.mark} [liberal]{.mark} orienting
[and humanizing frames of time and space. They are **fixed and rooted in
a place of elimination and expanding use for the settler's unending
pursuit**]{.mark} **of self actualization.**]{.underline} [By
settling]{.underline}, or gaining an exclusive claim to time and space,
[the Settler is able to simultaneously become a stable, coherent and
autonomous human subject who occupies space while they also experience
hyper mobility, transcendence and self directed
transformation]{.underline}. The [Settler moves back and forth at will
between states of rootedness and mobility]{.underline}, stability and
postmodern (self determined) constructedness. [[The Settlers' unfettered
movement]{.mark} between these contradictory spaces and states [is
**predicated on the "fixed-flux"**]{.mark} **of Native and Black
bodies**]{.underline}. Fixed-flux is the underside of the Settler's
unfettered mobility and self actualization. It is always being
susceptible to having the world flipped upside down at the whim of
another (the Settler). [Settlement functions like a violent form of
deconstruction]{.underline}. [Settlement as a gratuitously violent
project that kills the Native and accumulates the Black also reorganizes
discourse.]{.underline} The relationship that exists between the
signifier and signified for concepts like autochthony and indigeneity
and words like clearing under conditions of settlement become shifting
ground beneath our feet.17 The prior meanings held by the terms and
words autochthonous, indigenous and clearing are destabilized and then
completely evacuated due to the material and discursive muscle of
settlement. At the site of the clearing, [Settlers are able to become
autochthonous and indigenous at the same time]{.underline}. Frank
Wilderson helps us think about the kind of discursive and material
violence that occurs within what he calls the "Settler/Master/Human's
grammatical structure."18 Within this grammatical structure, Wilderson
argues that there is a disavowal of the violence of genocide in the way
the settler narrates the formation of the US. On one level, the
disavowal occurs through the settler's preferred part of speech.
Clearing is only spoken of as a noun in the Settler/Master/Human's
grammatical structure. Clearing is never used as a verb in the human's
grammatical structure. Wilderson draws our attention to its use:
"Clearing, in the Settler/Savage" relation, has two grammatical
structures, one a noun and the other as a verb. But the Western only
recognizes clearing as a noun. But prior to the clearing's fragile
infancy, that is before its cinematic legacy as a newborn place name, it
labored not across the land as a noun but as a verb on the body of the
"Savage," speaking civil society's essential status as an effect for
genocide."19 This discursive displacement represents an actual
displacement. As [the Settler/Master/Human renders the clearing a static
place, void of settler violence and absent of indigenous bodies and
relations to the land, the Settler also indigenizes themselves to this
abstract space]{.underline}. [The Settler is allowed to merge with the
land as they root themselve]{.underline}s. They become autochthonous
people that "sprang up from the land."20 [Settlers are now the group of
humans that establish a right/righteous relationship with the land.
Settlers proclaim themselves the new indigenous population]{.underline}.
The original indigenous peoples are stripped of their indigeneity and
rendered dead. Within the process of settlement, the indigenous people
become embedded in or are literally buried as the dead within the land.
[The Settler then assumes a new autochthonous identity and emerges from
the earth anew.]{.underline} Even when the Settler indigenizes or roots
themselves into the land; they do not become stuck there like Native
peoples. In her book, Black Body: Women, Colonialism and Space, Radhika
[Mohanram spends time explaining how enlightenment notions of the
Indigene and European binary operate]{.underline}.21 [[The body
conceived as incarcerated by nature is]{.mark} partially [achieved by
the discursive construction of the native as a "person]{.mark} who is
[born]{.mark} [and]{.mark} thus [belongs to a certain place,"]{.mark}
and is in fact over determined by that place]{.underline}.22 [[The
European on the other hand **can be of a place but is not incarcerated
by it like the Native**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Their settler
"indigeneity" offers them "unfettered mobility"]{.mark} as well as
unfettered self actualization]{.underline}. [Native people do not
acquire this through their indigenous status]{.underline}. [Upon
encountering the settler]{.underline} (who becomes indigenous) [the
Native experiences their indigeneity as non-existence and
death]{.underline}. [[The clearing]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[shapes
Blackness as it carves out the
settlement-plantation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The clearing in its verb
form certainly labored across the bodies of Native people. However,
[[the clearing]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[worked on and transformed the
bodies of Blacks]{.mark}. [The Black body is **turned into the
Settled-slave**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[Nana and
Elizabeth]{.mark} Peazant [are Settled-slaves whose bodies evince the
way that the process of settling "cleared" Blacks of all spatial
coordinates that could make them human]{.mark} during this process of
making the settlement/plantation]{.underline}. **[[Blacks become mere
'states of flux," and the atomic potential for
space.]{.underline}]{.mark}** At the site of the clearing, [both a
spatial and ontological production, **[Black bodies are the raw material
and precursor to space]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[While Black bodies
are]{.mark} geographic and [necessary to the production of space they
are not geographic subjects that humanly inhabit space]{.mark} at the
site of the clearing]{.underline}.[23]{.underline} As
geographic---dark---[matter and material under settlement they [make
space possible but cannot occupy it]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Existing in
a **continual state of liminality and change Black femaleness is a place
making unit but not in place**.]{.mark} **Place is where humanness
resides**.]{.underline} According to Tim Cresswell, **[place [and its
links to humanness, morality and identity are a part of a humanistic
project]{.mark}]{.underline}**.24 [For the humanist undertaking
geography, "ontological priority was given to the human immersion in
place rather than the abstractions of geometric space]{.underline}."
[[The **humanist concept of place is accompanied by the baggage of
morality, identity, authenticity and
exclusion**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Within modern thought systems,
there is a tendency to locate people with certain identities in certain
places. There is also a tendency within this metaphysical framework to
imagine "mobile people in wholly negative ways."27 [[Bodies]{.mark} on
the move or sentient beings [in a state of "fixed-flux]{.mark}" who slip
into death like the Native or slide and transform as fungible flesh
**[have no place]{.mark}** and are considered suspect within this
worldview. [Through humanist articulations]{.mark} and re-theorizations
[of place]{.mark}, [the **universal and abstract notion of space becomes
humanized and exclusionary**]{.mark} **admitting only a select group of
people.**]{.underline} Making a place is also about making a home.28
[Place (and space) as home was functioning within imperialist endeavors
of the enlightenment]{.underline} far before human geographers of the
1970s named it as such. As a geographer, Tuan has focused a great deal
of attention on the extent to which people have attempted to "create
order and homeliness out of the apparent chaos of raw nature."29 In fact
"the concept of place is central to our understanding of how people turn
nature into culture by making it their home."30 **[What happens when
this humanist endeavor of turning nature/chaos into culture/order/home
meets up with the imperialist endeavor?]{.underline}** Sylvia [Wynter
argues that both the Native and the Black are considered states of
non-Reason and chaos within Enlightenment humanism]{.underline}. [Under
imperialism, both the bodies and the lands of Native and Black people
were **states of chaos that needed to be ordered.**]{.underline} While
Tuan's configuration of place and the transformation of raw nature into
a home for humankind does not have the violent and exclusionary form of
the human in mind, my reconfiguration of the place of settlement does.
[The landscapes of settlement, when they appear to the eye as a tranquil
pasture with a log cabin or people sun bathing on a beach **conceal the
violent processes hidden in the clearing.**]{.underline} One way of
revealing what is hidden is through rethinking what a landscape is and
how it functions. Richard Schein presents an interpretation of landscape
as a process. In fact, Schein argues that landscape is always in the
"process of becoming."31 Another aspect of Schein's theorization of the
landscape that is productive is that he construes the landscapes as
having material and epistemological value. The epistemology of the
landscape disciplines those who come into contact with it. The
disciplinary element of landscape is embedded in the fact that the
material aspect of the landscape is seen, and presents itself as linear
and objective.32 The landscape is in fact not self evident but
duplicitous.33 Likewise [[settlement as a process]{.mark} and what it
achieves even in its materiality (clearing, settlement-plantation) [is
not self-evident but multivalent and at times counter
intuitive]{.mark}]{.underline}. [What is hidden is that [settlement is
not just the making of a physical location]{.mark} for the Settler;
rather, **[what is concealed is the simultaneous process of the Settler
rooting in order to launch]{.mark}**. [Settlement is the subjugation and
sinking/fixing of others into a state of flux]{.mark} (death,
fungibility) **[in order for the Settler to transcend into a state of
humanness]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[[As the ultimate self actualizing
human]{.mark}, [the Settler]{.mark} [can]{.mark} actually [overcome the
particularity of place]{.mark} (body, gender, race, abject sexuality)
[and launch into universal and abstract space
(humanness]{.mark}]{.underline}**). [To be human]{.underline} in Frank
Wilderson's terms [is to have "cartographic capacity]{.underline}."34
"[Spatial and temporal capacity is so immanent on the field of Whiteness
that the effects and permutations of its ensemble of questions and the
kinds of White bodies that can mobilize this universe of combinations
are seemingly infinite as well.]{.underline}"35 **[[To be a Savage or to
be Black is to exist in the realm of no time and
space]{.underline}]{.mark}**.36 [An apt visual for what happens when the
Settler (noun) settles (verb) both people and land is one of a
propelling long jumper. A long jumper is a subject who plants in order
to launch oneself into space. This process of disciplining bodies, land
and the viewers' eye is hard to always perceive.]{.underline}

### AT: Baudrillard\-\--Perm

#### Our [postmodern simulation of life]{.underline} is a [turn]{.underline} against the simulacrum, forcing it into its own [mad proliferation]{.underline} that produces [differentiation]{.underline} rather than [sameness]{.underline}.

If we contemplate how narrative-making is an art that simulates
identity, we might better appreciate the field of literary scholarship !
especially if we better understand the products of simulating identity
versus the consequences of representing identity. Jean Baudrillard
observes that our culture of simulation has become wholly reliant on
signifiers that have replaced "reality" with "hyperreality". Massumi
critiques [Baudrillard's notion of hyperreality as a perception that
leaves us in a sea of endlessly floating signifiers where "\[m\]eaning
has imploded"]{.underline} (Massumi, http://www.anu.edu.au). Massumi
asks, "[But do we really have no other choice than being a naïve realist
or being a sponge?]{.underline}" (ibid) [Instead, Massumi advocates
Deleuze's notion of simulacra as an alternative to "being a
sponge":]{.underline}

[The thrust of the process is not to become an equivalent of the "model"
but to]{.underline} **[turn against it]{.underline}** [and its world in
order to open a new space for the simulacrum's own]{.underline} **[mad
proliferation]{.underline}**. The simulacrum affirms its own difference.
[It is not an implosion, but a]{.underline}
**[differentiation]{.underline}**; it is an index not of absolute
proximity, but of galactic distances. (ibid)

Promulgating Deleuzian simulacra, Massumi rejects [Baudrillard's endless
sea of signifiers]{.underline} on the grounds that it [is **too
passive** a vision of the world]{.underline}. Massumi believes that
[Deleuze's figuration of simulacra lends the term more potency in that
the sea of signifiers we live in is not of endlessly nondiscriminate
labels, but rather, each singular signifier is a distinction **unto its
own**]{.underline}. [It is not about recognizing that we]{.underline}
(referent to things as well as persons) [are all really the same, it is
rather about recognizing that we are all really so incredibly
different.]{.underline}

In other words, [a]{.underline} **[postmodern literary simulation of
life]{.underline}** [can be]{.underline} **[indicative of the
turn]{.underline}** [that envisions potential political
change]{.underline}. Using Massumi's interpretation of Deleuzian
simulacra, I investigate how Choi simulates identity in her novel
American Woman by transgressing the boundaries between fiction and
non-fiction. By [imbricating]{.underline} her [story with non-fictional
information with fictive narrative]{.underline}, Choi [highlights the
permeability between what we perceive to be non-fiction and fiction in
order recognize our invested expectations in assimilation rather than
difference]{.underline}. She depicts how despite the U.S. media's
profound investment in revealing the "true" Pauline, not even Pauline
nor Jenny seem to know who this "true" Pauline is. On the other hand,
Choi showcases the media's absolute disinterest in Jenny; her narrative
emphasizes this fact by acutely focusing on Jenny's interior landscape.
In this way, Choi creates a paradoxical narrative that deconstructs
identity by thwarting our expectations of "discovering" any "true"
Pauline except through Jenny. In other words, Choi answers the real-life
question of Patty Hearst's identity as answerable only through the
fictive framework of Wendy Yoshimura's silenced narrative. In this way,
Choi' narrative reveals how **[identity]{.underline}** [is not found in
the assimilation of our desires but rather the]{.underline}
**[differences]{.underline}** [that we tend to overlook]{.underline}.
Choi chooses to [explore identity through the process of examining the
simulacra of U.S. media as commensurable to the simulacra of
fiction]{.underline}.

### AT: Identity-Based Ks\-\--Simulated Politics 

#### Representational identity politics are [pre-coded narratives]{.underline} that [recreate complicity]{.underline} to hegemonic oppression. Only by embracing the [logic of the cyborg]{.underline} in a [simulated politics]{.underline} can we construct space for our identities.

It is this severance from any original story that supports Haraway's
notion of simulating identity over representing identity. When Haraway
states that "[\[t\]he cyborg is not subject to]{.underline} Foucault's
[biopolitics; the cyborg]{.underline} **[simulates
politics]{.underline}**, [a much more potent field of
operations]{.underline}" (Haraway 164), she recognizes how [simulation
politics does not recapitulate the same kind of centralizing logic of
power that representation politics is susceptible to]{.underline}.
[Foucault's biopolitics describes the]{.underline} **[technologies of
oppression]{.underline}** [that the nation-state has exerted over marked
bodies in the guise of population hygiene.]{.underline} One step away
from eugenics, biopolitics organizes the population under the logic of
caring for the population such that a body is no longer an individual's
right but that one body is in the rightful care of everyone else. In
this way, [hegemonic power succeeds in representing the needs of a body
such that its oppression of that body is seemingly
justified]{.underline}. [For biopolitics to continue, we must
remain]{.underline} **[complicit]{.underline}** [to the myth that truth
is a representable phenomenon and that there lies an originary truth for
all bodies]{.underline}. Representational politics of identity for
marked bodies recapitulate this logic by perpetuating the myth that
certain bodies can represent a particular originary truth. [Relying on
the body as image, such a politics forces us to commit to a]{.underline}
**[pre-coded narrative]{.underline}** [that applies to certain multiple
bodies. In both cases of the nation-state as well as minority politics,
representational politics ultimately **substantiates** the kind of
boundaries that centralize and marginalize]{.underline}.

A **[simulational politics of identity]{.underline}** [based on
the]{.underline} **[logic of the cyborg]{.underline}** [resists the
centralization of power in that it rejects the myth of any originary
truth]{.underline}. [Instead, the simulation politics of the cyborg is
about producing its]{.underline} **[own truths]{.underline}** [based on
the recognition and transgression of the boundaries that sustain
hegemonic mythologies about truth and the body]{.underline}. According
to Haraway, [the body is no longer a unified, coherent and pure
entity]{.underline}. Subsequently, [to construct our identities based on
such notions of clarity and purity only serve to sustain
our]{.underline} **[complicit subservience]{.underline}** [to an
informatics of domination through the hegemonic technologization of our
bodies]{.underline}. In order to escape these systems of oppression,
[the cyborg offers its]{.underline} **[own
technologization]{.underline}** [of the body such that we embrace
the]{.underline} **[hybrid conditions of our bodies]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} the **[identities]{.underline}** [we consciously
construct]{.underline} around them. [Simulating identity]{.underline},
then, [is about recognizing that there is no original story, and
that]{.underline} **[the real story is the story that is unfolding right
in front of us.]{.underline}** **[Identity cannot be represented nor can
it be discovered]{.underline}**. Rather, [identity unravels]{.underline}
**[experientially]{.underline}** [such that it is recognized
processually as we transgress across boundaries that reveal the
constructed conditions of subjectivity]{.underline}. Haraway's cyborg
articulates the profound stakes in which such an alternate politics of
identity are invested in when she states: "[The stakes in the border war
have been the territories of production, reproduction, and
imagination]{.underline}." (Haraway 151)
