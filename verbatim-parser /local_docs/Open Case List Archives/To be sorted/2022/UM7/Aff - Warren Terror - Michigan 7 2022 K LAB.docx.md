## Warr-en-Terror

#### Blackness lives in the prehistory of our times. In this, blackness must always exist as antithetical to *civilizational development*. Frozen in time, Africa represents the geographical, temporal, and cultural depiction of the *primitive* and *tribal* other in which "Africa was 'a fetish-land, inhabited by cannibals, dervishes and witch doctors". This is not just an intentional remapping of the globe, but a techno-logistical mechanism used to separate two worlds.

#### Contemporary history has used this "distance" to exonerate ourselves from any worldly attachments to the in-human. Represented as a "*threat to civilization*" Africa must become an American experiment, to "make civilized" the very definition of *incivility*.

#### In this sense, NATO has become America's new colonial toy through which we can assert an unparalleled level of power over primitive civilizations. Uncontested in its power, the US is able to lead NATO through a new era of imperial dominance that is constituted by "global raciality".

Antiblack racism in securitization theory writings on Africa
'Antiblackness' is a term used to describe the specificity of racism
against people of African descent in the post-Columbus world.
**[[Chattel slavery turned people from]{.mark} the [Africa]{.mark}n

**[[In]{.underline}]{.mark}** much **[[international relations
scholarship,]{.mark} [blackness]{.mark}]{.underline}** continues to
**[[signify]{.underline}]{.mark}** ultimate (moral, sexual, and
political) **[[primitivism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, an inherent
propensity to (sexual and political) violence, and sexual excess and
danger. Does securitization theory overcome, replicate, or deepen
antiblack thought on 'Africa'? Certainly, securitization theory sees a
tendency towards primal anarchy and the 'state of nature' in many
non-Western parts of the world (the Balkans; Eastern Europe; Central,
South, and East Asia; the Middle East; and South America), but 'Africa'
is particularly maligned. Often, classic
**[[securitization]{.underline}]{.mark}** theory **[[treats the entire
continent as a single entity, a space where normal politics is weak and
oversecuritized, the state or social contract
fails]{.mark}]{.underline}** (or was never established), [**[and 'man'
reverts to (or never left) the state of nature]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
'Africa is a pessimist's paradise, a place where the Hobbesian
hypothesis that in the absence of a political Leviathan life for
individuals will be nasty, brutish, and short seems to be widely
manifest in everyday life' ([Buzan and Wæver,
2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
219). Elsewhere, however, it adds some complexity by seeing Africa in
terms of multiple temporalities, being both 'premodern', having elements
of the 'modern', and threatening a 'back to the future' scenario. On the
one hand, a book like Regions and Powers ([Buzan and Wæver,
2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921))
offers a sweeping history of Europe over millennia (containing little
mention of colonialism), but a history of Africa that covers only
official decolonization and the post--Cold War era: a matter of mere
decades. **[Completely [missing is a]{.mark}ny [historical account of
how colonialism and enslavement shaped]{.mark} not only [African]{.mark}
but also European [security relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**
([Agathangelou and Ling,
2004b](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921);
[Barkawi,
2006](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921);

[Krishna,
2001](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921)),
and the idea of Europe itself ([Mudimbe,
1988](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921);
[Said,
1979](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921)).
Conversely, another canonical securitization theory text asserts that
'**[[in the]{.mark} contemporary [international
]{.mark}]{.underline}**[system]{.mark}, some prestate referent objects
are still active. The remnants of **[[tribal barbarians]{.mark} still
[exist in]{.mark}]{.underline}** parts of Central Asia and
**[[Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Some hint of how [these]{.mark}
**[[tribes worked as]{.mark} referent [objects for military
security]{.mark} can be gleaned from contemporary civil wars in
Afghanistan and Somalia']{.underline}** ([Buzan et al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
53, emphasis added). The past-tense 'worked' here implies that we can
learn about premodern times (in Europe) by looking at present-day
Afghanistan or Somalia, whose backwards 'tribal barbarian' populations
constitute a prestate referent. These two temporalities come together in
the statement that 'in Africa, the main societal referent objects are a
mix of premodern -- the extended family, village, clan, and tribe -- and
modern, the "state-nation"' ([Buzan et al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
126). Securitization theory, then, sees Africa as temporally anomalous
-- that is, both premodern and modern -- because it manifests both a
postcolonial present and a potential degeneration to a
precolonial/premodern past, as when [Buzan and Wæver
(2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
221), drawing from other authors, including Kaplan, speculate that: the
period of colonization and decolonization might, in the long view,
appear as something of an interlude, a period with its own distinctive
characteristics, rather than a point of permanent transformation from
premodern to modern. If back-to-the-future pessimism is right, then what
we are looking at now is some phase in the terminal collapse of the
Westphalian experiment in Africa. This passage outlines a 'back to the
future' scenario in which Africa returns to its default state of
precolonial, tribal, anarchic statelessness. Here, as elsewhere,
**[[securitization theory]{.mark}]{.underline}** does not entirely
ignore histories of colonization: it admits that colonialism had an
impact on Africa, but it **[[understands this impact not as an
extraction of resources and labor and a violent transformation of people
into chattel, but as an 'experiment' aimed at bringing the European
Westphalian state to 'premodern' barbarians]{.underline}]{.mark}** (see
[Buzan and Wæver,
2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
221; [Buzan et al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
53, 126). Colonial and ongoing postcolonial and settler-colonial
exploitation does not feature in this analysis, and decolonization
appears not as a project of liberation but as a potential backslide into
primal anarchy ([Buzan and Wæver,
2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
345). For securitization theory, histories of colonialism look less like
violent ongoing exploitation than a missed opportunity for Africa to
become more modern, desecuritized, and European. Why is 'Africa' missing
this opportunity? **[[Securitization theory's methodological whiteness
leads it to assert]{.underline}]{.mark}**, without substantiation,
**[[that the cause of this backsliding must not be the ongoing
extractive violence of liberal powers but the failure of African people
and states to 'desecuritize']{.underline}]{.mark}**: Because political
violence has been such an endemic feature of the African landscape, and
**[[because the crisis of the African state is so central to the
pervasive insecurity on the continent, we will take the existence of
systematic political violence to indicate the presence of a dominant
securitization]{.mark}.]{.underline}** ([Buzan and Wæver,
2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
223) This is strikingly circular reasoning, where premises and
conclusions guarantee each other. Securitization theory starts, as we
have seen, from the axioms that **[['normal politics' tames violence and
irrational securitization]{.mark}s [threaten 'normal politics'.]{.mark}
[Seeing Africa as]{.mark} a [violent, anarchic space, lacking in]{.mark}
'normal' [civilized politics,]{.mark} securitization theory [assumes
this]{.mark} must be [because securitization has run
amok.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As a result, African 'dominant
securitization' can be taken for granted, as a foil to the supposed
peacefulness of Europe, and therefore as evidence that 'normal politics'
tames violence, and so on[. **[Securitization
theory]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[here [turns an antiblack narrative of
African]{.mark} (a)[history]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Africa is primitive,
violent, anachronistic) **[[into an]{.mark} equally [antiblack normative
proposition: that Africa is culpable for failing]{.mark} to produce
['normal politics'.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[European colonial
violence is]{.mark} occluded or, worse,
[exonerated]{.mark}:]{.underline}** many African elites publicly
embraced a negative view of globalization, and took the view that their
weak position in the global periphery was a major explanation for their
difficulties. This led to a convenient rhetoric of 'neo-colonial'
securitization that sought, often successfully, to divert attention from
the indigenous causes of Africa's difficulties. ([Buzan and Wæver,
2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
251) **[[This]{.mark} [not]{.mark} [only]{.mark} [sanitizes]{.mark} the
[violence of colonialism]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [enslavement,]{.mark}
[it]{.mark} goes so far as to [cast anti-colonial politics as the
problem]{.mark}]{.underline}**.[4](javascript:popRef('fn4-0967010619862921'))
**[[With Europe exonerated, Africa]{.mark} is then able to
[appear]{.mark} as [a threat to Europe.]{.mark} We have already seen
that [securitization]{.mark} theory seeks to [protect]{.mark} Western
'progress' and [normal politics from]{.mark} excessive securitization
and [a]{.mark} potential [fall into primal
anarchy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It is similarly concerned to defend
normal politics outside the West but sees this as more hopeless: 'In
regions dominated by weak or failed states, real prospects exist that
the local level will become dominant, with securitization forming
microregions. To the list of microregions we should perhaps add the
Hobbesian anarchies in some inner cities of megalopolises' ([Buzan et
al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
70). Later, this idea is expanded: As argued by [Robert Kaplan
(1994)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921),
units other than states have created new lines of division.... The
booming megacities in the Third World, with their enormous slum suburbs,
produce large populations that identify neither with their clans or
tribes nor with states or nations.... **[Large groups of people who
focus on immediate material survival needs become nonidentity
factors]{.underline}** and might enter the sociopolitical realm as the
joker at some later point when they suddenly do acquire or generate an
identity. ([Buzan et al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
127) Here, **[those who dwell in slums are figured as people without
identities, or political subjectivities, not fully political, and
perhaps not fully human.]{.underline}** (Even cursory empirical
investigation would prove this false: there are robust traditions of
political activism in slums across the globe, including across the
African continent.) Because they exist in this state of nature (i.e.
'focus on immediate material survival needs'), **[these racialized
'jokers' are potential threats to Europe, though in a way that is
particularly tied to securitization theory's constructivist
methodology]{.underline}**: 'Another effect of Kaplanesque anarchy,
especially the disease--crime--population--migration circles in Africa,
is the unofficial erection of Atlantic and Mediterranean walls by which
North Americans and Europeans define a category of Africa and Africans
as the major zone of anarchy, danger, and disease to be shut off from
"our world"' ([Buzan et al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
127). This asserts that 'Africa' is a space of 'Kaplanesque anarchy'
and, at the same time, warns against the securitization of 'Africa and
Africans' in the West. **[What [securitization theory's analysis of
Africa produces]{.mark}, in this formulation, is nothing other than [an
updated 'white man's burden':]{.mark} it is [incumbent on the civilized
not to turn away]{.mark} from [the]{.mark} plight of the [primitive, but
the civilized must]{.mark} also take care to [avoid being corrupted
by]{.mark} their [primitive anarchy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** We can see
here, finally, how **[little separates this contemporary school of
security analysis from the openly antiblack racism of its Victorian
predecessors.]{.underline}**

#### NATO's history in Africa is deeply intertwined with antiblackness -- from NATO secret armies staging coups in Algeria in the 60s, to covert operations in Libya in the name of stability, to modern day AFRICOM military extraction projects for resources - Africa has been the medium of Western expansion and continuation.

counter terrorism operation and yet the rate of terrorist attacks in
Africa have actually increased since the establishment of AFRICOM in
October 2008. [AFRICOM actively works with terrorist groups to
destabilize the countries they are based in, all to steal resources.
AFRICOM is responsible for]{.underline}much of, if not m[ost of, the
death and destruction in Africa within the last decade.]{.underline}
AFRICOM's interests solely lie in protecting the neo colonial presence
and activities the U.S engages in to compete with China and Russia. Only
within the recent year has Amnesty International condemned the frequent
use of drones that AFRICOM utilizes. [AFRICOM had drone bombings ordered
so frequently that they were forced to make quarterly reports of all
civilian casualties in their drone strikes]{.underline}, before they
never kept any such record. [Ever since they have started reporting
civilian casualties, they have only counted 5 people, which entirely
conflicts with local reports from the countries they bomb and their
operations continue to be shrouded in secrecy]{.underline}. Over the
last 3 months, AFRICOM's militarized activity in African countries has
increased heavily, particularly in Somalia. Since the beginning of 2020,
AFRICOM has announced 39 airstrikes in Somalia. The command announced a
total of 36 such bombings from 2009 to 2017, under Obama, peaking in
2016 with 19 declared drone strikes. In 2019, under President Donald
Trump, the U.S. conducted 63 air attacks in Somalia, the most ever in a
single year. The [massive escalation of]{.underline} the U[.S military
occupation in Somalia comes as U.N.]{.underline} Secretary-General
António Guterres has repeatedly [appealed for a global ceasefire due to
the Covid-19 pandemic]{.underline}. "There should be only one fight in
our world today, our shared battle against Covid-19, we must mobilize
every ounce of energy to defeat it" stated Guterres. [That same
day]{.underline} on April 3rd, 2020 [AFRICOM conducted an "airstrike
targeting al-Shabaab terrorists in the vicinity of Bush Madina,
Somalia,"]{.underline} according to a command press release. AFRICOM
claimed five members of al-Shabab were killed in the strike. According
to the Somali newspaper Somali Affairs "The US Africa Command has
released a report on civilian casualties in its operations against
Al-Shabaab in Somalia. The report acknowledged the death of one civilian
as well as three others who were injured following an air raid in the
vicinity of Jilib town of Middle Jubba in February this year. U[S
airstrikes across Somalia regions, aimed at degrading Al-Shabab, have
been inflicting casualties on the civilian population in those
areas.]{.underline} After an outcry over [these deaths]{.underline},
which [were normally left unacknowledged by the US
military]{.underline}, Africom started investigating over a dozen
reported incidents where civilians were said to have been killed. In
more recent Africom operations in Somalia, [US drones today reportedly
bombed areas in Jilib town believed to have been hosting Al-Shabaab
militants, killing even more civilians]{.underline}. One of several
missiles fired by the US drones had hit the house of an innocent family,
killing two young boys aged between eight and 13 years." Since April
last year, [AFRICOM has admitted to killing five Somali civilians and
injuring six others, but none of those families or victims have been
compensated by the U.S military operation.]{.underline} The response to
African protests of the American police murder of black people has
reflected that [the U.S is inherently anti black in their own country
and in the countries they occupy.]{.underline} [Outrage towards the US
emanated from the Congo, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, all
condemning the killing.]{.underline} The response from the African Union
on May 29th reads "the Chairperson of the African Union Commission
Moussa Faki Mahamat strongly condemns the murder of George Floyd that
occurred in the United States of America at the hands of law enforcement
officers, and wishes to extend his deepest condolences to his family and
loved ones. Recalling the historic Organization of Africa Unity (OAU)
Resolution on Racial Discrimination in the United States of America made
by African Heads of State and Government, at the OAU's First Assembly
Meeting held in Cairo, Egypt from 17 to 24 July 1964, the Chairperson of
the African Union Commission firmly reaffirms and reiterates the African
Union's rejection of the continuing discriminatory practices against
Black citizens of the United States of America. He further urges the
authorities in the United States of America to intensify their efforts
to ensure the total elimination of all forms of discrimination based on
race or ethnic origin." [Since then AFRICOM has only increased their
military operations in Africa, continuing to murder innocents and steal
Africa's natural resources.]{.underline} The [consequences of the
militarization of U.S. policy toward Africa include an unknown and
growing number of civilian deaths, deepening conflict and poverty, and
an increase in violent movements in Africa]{.underline}, particularly in
the Sahel region. [Amnesty International released a report last year on
the increase in U.S. airstrikes and civilian deaths in Somalia, deaths
that were not reported by AFRICOM or the U.S government, and it will
forever be unclear how many war crimes AFRICOM has done to the people of
Africa.]{.underline} The need for awareness of these horrid deeds is
more than urgent as many people in the West and across the world have no
idea what AFRICOM even is, the protests to American imperialism all but
leave out AFRICOM and their operations throughout the continent of
Africa, which is something that needs to drastically change.

#### But, within the plane of territorial domination comes the emergence of a new era in which technological systems of control and biopolitical governance have become the currency for warfare. The [cyber-securitized]{.underline} medium of surveillance, information gathering, and scientific metaphysics are all backed by the liberal "objectivity" of [artificial intelligence]{.underline} and [biotechnology]{.underline}. The racialized heuristic of emerging technologies is rooted in the slow masking and camouflage of anti-black violence away from explicit plantation politics into implicit technical codes.

[Molecular and Digital Revolutions and the Whiteness of Post-human Life
FSS's [undertheorization of racism]{.mark} and colonialism]{.underline}
also [[produces inaccurate genealogies of]{.mark} (life) [sciences and

attention to]{.underline} Foucault's postcolonial critics or any serious
inquiry into [[lines of continuity between **White supremacist

dependent, epistemically and ontologically, on what the sciences of life
say that species life is." As such, "\[i\]n the molecular age life is no
longer simply the life of population as Foucault documented . . .
because molecular science has transformed what we understand a living
thing to be" (Dillon and Lobo-Guerrero 2008, 286). Dillon and Reid
similarly claim to trace shifting notions of life. They assert that over
the past five decades "the very ontology of biological life has shifted
to the ground of 'information'" (Dillon and Reid 2009, 22) and that
distinctions between animate and inanimate, biological and nonbiological
"have been newly construed and problematized" (Dillon and Reid 2009,
22). Though much of this is derivative of Ian Hacking and Nikolas Rose's
work, attention to the digital and molecular has particular impacts in
the international and security fields. According to Dillon and Reid
(2009, 22), digital and molecular "reproblematizations" of life have
impacted the biopolitical strategies of liberal internationalism:
"\[t\]he very space of enmity is itself re-problematized. Who is
dangerous, what is dangerous, how things become dangerous are all
transformed" (Dillon and Reid 2009, 107). This has apparently resulted
in a shift from scientific racism to "new racism," with an emphasis on
cultural difference rather than biological hierarchies. [FSS's ability
to [examine how science has shaped the biopolitical strategies of
security and liberal internationalism is limited]{.mark} [by]{.mark} its
**persistent [Eurocentrism]{.mark}** [and **undertheorization of
race**.]{.mark} Societal [notions of "life" are]{.mark} treated as
[interchangeable]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the life sciences' supposedly
**postracial [understanding of life as]{.mark}**]{.underline} generic
[[**data**.]{.mark} [This fails to engage with]{.mark} either the
**ingrained (settler) [coloniality of technoscience]{.mark}**
[or]{.mark} the **stubborn (and [institutionalized]{.mark}) [persistence
of broader structures of White supremacy and
anti-Blackness]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} This has serious]{.underline}
empirical [implications.]{.underline} For instance, [Dillon's discussion
of "new" [risk analysis and biometrics does not consider how these
security technologies have been designed to **police enslaved
populations** and **surveille Black people**]{.mark}]{.underline} (cf.
Browne 2015), [[as]{.mark} part of [a]{.mark} long-standing [legacy of
**colonial techniques of "identity dominance"**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Bell 2013). Similarly, [FSS discussions of the molecular [fail to
engage with]{.mark} the contemporary [racial politics of]{.mark} genetic
[science]{.mark}]{.underline} (Duster 2003; TallBear 2013; Nelson 2016);
[[how molecular life sciences were and are fueled by **experimentation

(Washington 2006; Dudley 2012; Mosby 2013), [[including]{.mark} the
movement of pharmaceutical [clinical trials from US prisons to the

related [racialized economies of labor]{.mark} in the global surrogacy
industry]{.underline} (Twine 2011) to name just a few examples. Instead,
highly [**abstract formulations** stand in for historically specific
forms of power]{.underline}. Dillon and Reid write that "\[p\]ower is
palimpsestuous. New forms and relations of power become superimposed on
older ones. Previous relations and accounts of power are rubbed out but
may not be entirely effaced" (Dillon and Reid 2009, 124). This statement
comes with no serious empirical engagement with the persistence---and
modulation---of scientific racism into the twenty-first century. Instead
[[we are]{.mark} [to believe that racism is now **cultural, not
scientific**]{.mark}]{.underline}---and, for that matter, [[**that
science itself isn't cultural**.]{.mark} [The result is]{.mark} an
**[e(race)sure]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Moore 2012) [[of]{.mark} the
[ways]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [racialized]{.mark} [subjects]{.mark}
continue to always already [signify violence]{.mark} [that]{.mark} once
again **[shores up the foundational White]{.mark} FSS
[mythology]{.mark}** [that everyone is]{.mark} (**potentially**)
**[dangerous]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}, therefore, **[vulnerable]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} the punitive and/or lethal dimensions of [liberal

biopolitical liberal internationalism]{.underline} thus [reproduce,
rather than challenge, the promise that liberal war will **transcend the
global color line**]{.underline} (Richter-Montpetit 2014b).

#### These emergent technologies are rooted in a scientific calculation and false objectivity that relies upon blackness as metaphysical nothingness that sutures legal epistemology within an anti-black telos.

The event also put the metaphysical infrastructure into perspective for
me. Two philosophical forces were colluding (and at times conflicting)
to orient the solutions proposed and the audiences' responses, and both
presented "[free black" as a concept with meaning: black humanism and
postmetaphysics. I use these two terms to docket a certain posture
toward metaphysics---and the ontological ground metaphysics offers.
Black hu- manism enters into romance with metaphysics]{.underline}.
**[It appropriates schema- tization, [calculation, technology]{.mark},
probability, [and universality---all the instruments of metaphysical
thinking---to make epistemological]{.mark}, ethical, [and ontological
claims concerning blackness and freedom]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Freedom
is possible, then, because metaphysics provides it with ontology**; from
there, all sorts of solutions, policies, and practices emerge to address
antiblackness. [Scientific reasoning, technological innovation, and
legality are tools black hu- manists use to quantify suffering, measure
progress, proffer universal nar- ratives of humanity, and reason with
antiblack institutions.]{.mark}**]{.underline} All problems have
solutions for black humanists, and their task is to uncover the solution
the problem conceals, as this uncovering equates to an eradication of
the problem. Black humanism relies on an eclectic approach to
antiblackness--- Hegelian synthesis, Kantian rationalism, Platonic
universals/idealism, Car- tesian representation, and empiricism. In
short, black humanists lay claim to the ~~being~~ of the human (and the
human's freedom) through metaphys- ical thinking and instruments.
Postmetaphysics, in contrast, attempts the surmounting or twisting
\[verwunden\] of the ground and logic of metaphysics.3 It insists that
meta- physics reproduces pain and misery and restricts human freedom.
**[[Rep- resenting the human as an object of scientific
thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}** (e.g., **[[biology]{.mark}, economics,
[law]{.mark}]{.underline}**[) **[destroys the spontaneity and uniqueness
of the human]{.underline}**]{.mark}--- things that make the human
special. The ground, then, upon which meta- physics relies is
problematic, and this ground must be destroyed (i.e., twisted) and
deconstructed (i.e., displaced) to free the human. Postmeta- physics
would advocate for a self-consumption of this ground through
hermeneutical strategies, unending deconstructions, and forms of plu-
rality (such as hermeneutic nihilism). The post is rather a misnomer, if
we think of post as an overcoming \[überwunden\]; the postmetaphysician
will never overcome metaphysics. A residue will always remain, but the
postmetaphysician hopes to reduce this metaphysical residue to render it
inoperative. The postmetaphysician understands antiblackness as a prob-
lem of metaphysics, especially the way [**scientific thinking has
classified ~~being~~ along racial difference and biology.** The task of
the postmetaphysi- cal project is to free blacks from the misery
metaphysics produces by un- dermining its ground. Hermeneutical
strategies, which contest ultimate foundations, would question the
ground of race (racial metaphysics) and its claim to universal
truth]{.underline}. Black humanism and postmetaphysics, however, leave
the question of ~~being~~ unattended as it concerns black(ness). Both
assume ~~being~~ is ap- plicable and operative---black humanism relies
on metaphysical ~~being~~ and postmetaphysics relies on multiple
interpretations or manifestations of ~~being~~. In other words, the
human's ~~being~~ grounds both philosophical perspectives. Although
postmetaphysics allows for a capacious under- standing of the human and
~~being~~, it still posits ~~being~~ universally as it con- cerns
freedom; no entity is without it, even if it manifests differently, or
as difference, if we follow Deleuze. This is to suggest that both
discourses proceed as if the question of ~~being~~ has been settled and
that we no longer need to return to it---the question, indeed, has been
elided in critical dis- courses concerning blackness. Ontological Terror
seeks to put the ques- tion back in its proper place: at the center of
any discourse about ~~being~~. Ontological Terror meditates on this
[(non)relation between blackness and ~~being~~ by arguing that black
~~being~~ incarnates metaphysical nothing, the terror of metaphysics, in
an antiblack world. Blacks, then, have func- tion but not
~~being~~---the function of black(ness) is to give form to a ter-
rifying formlessness (nothing).]{.underline} ~~being~~ claims function
as its property (all functions rely on ~~being~~, according to this
logic, for philosophical presentation), but the aim of black nihilism is
to expose the unbridgeable rift between ~~being~~ and function for
blackness. The puzzle of blackness, then, is that it functions in an
antiblack world without ~~being~~---much like "nothing" functions
philosophically without our metaphysical under- standing of ~~being~~,
an extraordinary mystery. Put differently, metaphysics is obsessed with
both blackness and nothing, and the two become syn- onyms for that which
ruptures metaphysical organization and form. The Negro is black because
the Negro must assume the function of nothing in a metaphysical world.
The world needs this labor. This obsession, how- ever, also transforms
into hatred, since nothing is incorrigible---it shat- ters ontological
ground and security. **[[Nothing terrifies metaphysics, and metaphysics
attempts to dominate it]{.mark} by turning nothing [into an object of
knowledge, something it can dominate, analyze, calculate, and schema-
tize]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When I speak of function, I mean the
projection of nothing's terror onto black(ness) as a strategy of
metaphysics' will to power. How, then, does metaphysics dominate
nothing? By objectifying nothing through the black Negro. In this
analysis, [**metaphysics can never provide freedom or humanity for
blacks, since it is the [objectification]{.mark}, domination, [and
extermination of blacks that keep the metaphysical world
intact]{.mark}**[. **Metaphysics uses blacks to maintain a sense of
security and to sustain the fantasy of triumph---the triumph over the
nothing that limits human freedom**]{.mark}**.** Without blacks, I
argue, **[nothing's terror debilitates metaphysical procedures,
epistemolo- gies, boundaries, and institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Black freedom, then, would constitute a form of world destruction, and
this is [precisely why]{.underline} [humanism has **[failed to
accomplish its romantic goals of equality, justice, and
recognition]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In short, black humanism has
neglected the relationship between black(ness) and nothing in its
yearning for belonging, acceptance, and freedom. The Negro was invented
to fulfill this function for metaphysics, and the hu- manist dream of
transforming invention into human ~~being~~ is continu- ally deferred
(because it is impossible). Ontological Terror challenges the claim that
blacks are human and can ground existence in the same ~~being~~ of the
human. I argue that blacks are introduced into the metaphysical world as
available equipment in human form. Black thinking, then, must return to
the question of ~~being~~ and the relation between this question and the
antiblack violence sustaining the world. It is my contention that black
thinking is given a tremendous task: to approach the ontological abyss
and the metaphysical violence sustaining the world. Ontological Terror
suggests that black thinking cannot be overcome--- we will never reach
the end of black thinking or its culmination, unlike the end of
philosophy describing postmetaphysical enterprises.4 In other words,
postmetaphysics has broached the question of ~~being~~ and has com-
menced the destruction \[Destruktion\] of the metaphysical
infrastructure, which systemically forgets ~~being~~. Postmetaphysics,
then, is a project of remnants, as Santiago Zabala suggests. [After we
have used hermeneutics, deconstruction, rhizomes, and mathematical sets
to devastate metaphys- ics, we are left with ontological rubble---a
trace of metaphysics and a re- constructed ~~being~~.]{.underline}
Postmetaphysics, then, must ask, "How is it going with ~~being~~?" Or
what is the state of ~~being~~ in this contemporary moment, and how does
the world remain open to ~~being~~'s unfolding and happening (as well as
its withdrawal and abandoning of Dasein)? "How is it going with
~~being~~?" is the fundamental question of our era, according to
postmeta- physics; only the twisting and severe rearranging
\[verwunden\] of meta- physics can usher this question into the world.
Both metaphysics and postmetaphysics, however, have forgotten the Ne-
gro, just as they have forgotten ~~being~~---to remember ~~being~~ one
must also re- member the Negro. The Negro Question and the Question of
~~being~~ are in- tertwined. Postmetaphysical enterprises reach a limit
in destruction, since it is the Negro that sustains metaphysics and
enables the forgetting of Be- ing (i.e., metaphysics can forget
~~being~~ because it uses the Negro to project nothing's terror and
forget ~~being~~). In a sense, the global use of the Negro fulfills the
ontological function of forgetting ~~being~~'s terror, majesty, and
incorrigibility. The consequence of this is that as long as
postmetaphysical enterprises leave the Negro unattended in their
thinking, it inadvertently sustains metaphysical pain and violence.
This, I argue, is why we will never overcome \[überwunden\] metaphysics
because the world cannot overcome the Negro---the world needs the Negro,
even as the world despises it. This is, of course, a Heideggerian
approach to the thinking of ~~being~~ and Nothing. More than any other
philosopher, Heidegger pursued metaphysical violence and the question of
~~being~~ relentlessly, and for this rea- son I find his philosophy
indispensable and necessary. Ontological Terror thinks with and against
Heidegger, since I believe Heidegger's destruc- tion of metaphysics can
assist black studies in the tremendous task of thinking ~~being~~ and
blackness, as Grant Farred has suggested.5 Heidegger's Destruktion
covers a wide range of philosophical issues, and it is not my objective
to address all of these complexities; my interest is the relation
between Heidegger's critique of metaphysical violence, available equip-
ment, and the task of remembering as it concerns blackness. What I hope
to broach in this book, with all the aporias such as broaching
encounters, is that the Negro is the missing element in Heidegger's
thinking (as well as in that of those postmetaphysicians indebted to
Heidegger, such as Jean- Luc Nancy, Giorgio Agamben, Alain Badiou, and
Gianni Vattimo). If, as we learn in ~~being~~ and Time, Dasein uses
tools to experience its thrown- ness in the world (establishing its
facticity) and to develop its [unique proj- ect oriented toward the
future (projectionality]{.underline}), the Negro---[as commod- ity,
object, slave, putative backdrop, prisoner, refugee, and
corpse]{.underline}---is the quintessential tool Dasein uses. The use of
the Negro metaphysically and ontologically, as a tool, is what black
thinking is tasked with pursuing. Thus, black thinking (and
postmetaphysics) must ask the unasked ques- tion "How is it going with
black ~~being~~?" Without broaching this question, [all forms of
destruction are just reconstitutions, since the world continues to use
the Negro (as black and nothing) to forget ~~being~~ and the sadistic
pleasure of this forgetfulness.]{.underline}

#### Thus, we endorse an unflinching paradigmatic analysis of social death and the anti-black cyber economy that constitutes the formulation of modernity. This must be the only ethical demand in an anti-black world capable of coming to terms with the racial violence of the status quo.

When I started reading Afropessimism, I intuitively hypothesized that it
was revealing the modern "secularization" and re-articulation of
original sin. That is, [Afropessimism's [paradigmatic analysis shows
how]{.mark} the [epidermalization]{.mark}]{.underline} and a priori
social death of Blackness [[(re)constitutes modern Humanity as
fundamentally "fallen"]{.underline}]{.mark}---even while this fallenness
is intrinsically projected onto Blackness. I find Jesse Couenhoven's
summation of Augustine's five-fold doctrine in my first epigraph
particularly elucidating in this regard. By reading Couenhoven's
breakdown through an Afropessimist lens, I can present my hypothesis as
follows: 1) [the source of original sin is the]{.underline} (modern)
[Human's primal scene of inventing Blackness as the
politico-onto-theological incarnation of Slaveness.]{.underline} 2) All
Humans share in this sin because of our solidarity through
anti-Blackness, the progenitor of (the) race. The results of the primal
scene are twofold. 3) From birth (qua natality), all Humans have an
inherited sin (original sin itself), which comes in two forms: common
guilt qua ontological parasitism, and a constitutional fault of
disordered desire (qua libidinal parasitism) and ignorance of this
parasitism. 4) In addition, the Human suffers a penalty because of sin:
[Humans' (im)potentialities are weakened]{.underline}--- namely, the
potentiality to not be (anti-Black) and the attendant potentiality to
end the World---and [we will experience (being-toward-)death as our
ontological condition of possibility]{.underline}.30 5) Finally, both
[anti-Black original sin]{.underline} and penalty [are transmitted from
generation to generation as the condition of possibility for
natality]{.underline}. In turn, I understand Wilderson's gesture in my
second epigraph as [[a demand to confront the ramifications of this
original sin so as to render its anti-Black economy of redemption
inoperative]{.underline}]{.mark}. That is, if critical theory and
radical politics---subtended by the Human's grammar of suffering---are
to rid themselves of their inheritance and ignorance of both this
(ontological) original sin and its (unconscious) penalty, then they must
refuse the logics of loss that catalyze their desire and capacity for
redemption/restoration. [[Such refusal]{.mark},]{.underline} meanwhile,
[**[must be informed and sustained by an unflinching contemplation of
Black absence as the new paradigm for radical theory and
politics]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This would entail, I suggest, a mode of
becoming absence31---beyond Being and redemption. In Maurice Blanchot's
words: "When the subject \[qua Human\] becomes absence, then the absence
of a subject, or dying as subject, subverts the whole sequence of
existence, causes time to take leave of its order, opens life to its
passivity, exposing it to the unknown, to the stranger---to the
friendship that never is declared." 32 The aspiration of this
essay---and the Black messianic33---is [[to theorize a fidelity to Black
absence that can only "honor" its irreparable
dishonor]{.underline}]{.mark} as follows: [[by coming to grips
with]{.underline} 1) [the Human's]{.underline}]{.mark}
constitutive-[[parasitic inheritance of presence]{.underline}34]{.mark}
and 2) [[the Black demand for a mode of]{.underline}]{.mark} (becoming)
[[absence]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such a radically passive35 encounter may
help cause (historical) time to take leave of its (progressive) order
[[and subvert the whole grammar of Being, exposing the Human to the
Black in a friendship that can never be declared as
such.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### The ROTB is to endorse advocacies not actions -- reject the dogma of ideological heg -- it's the foundation of anti-black sentiments

**BAPTISE 22** - Bala James Baptiste - professor of mass communication
and the chair of the Division of Communications at Miles College, earned
the doctorate at Indiana University, 5-25-2022, \"Ideological Hegemony:
A Precursor to Institutional Racism,\" AAIHS,
https://www.aaihs.org/ideological-hegemony-a-precursor-to-institutional-racism///vi

Intellectuals advanced the concept of ideological hegemony, which is
applicable to the establishment and change of relationships between
Caucasians and African Americans. Marxist theorists Antonio Gramsci,
Stuart Hall, Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, and others expounded in
regards to ideological hegemony, the ideas and structures wherein
individuals without access to power reinforce instruments of action of
the powerful despite their potentially harmful and silencing effects.
Marxism analyzes the relationship between the powerful and the
powerless. The writings of Karl Marx, a German sociologist, historian,
and economist, who published in 1848 with Friedrich Engles the Communist
Manifesto, heavily influenced the intellectuals. The celebrated
Manifesto pamphlet concluded that the creation of a society with one
class of people would end problems between the haves and have nots.
Hall, the Jamaican-born British Marxist sociologist, cultural theorist,
and political activist articulated his view of ideology. The concept is
more than a belief system or a way of thinking. Ideology is an
actionable principle enabling the organization of political or economic
functions in a society or a sector of a populace. Ideology aims to
create public annunciation of policies for the realization of a set of
beliefs. Communism, capitalism, liberalism, conservatism, nationalism,
and multiculturalism are examples of ideologies. During the modern Civil
Rights Movement, academics and activists recognized Hall as one of the
first scholars to articulate the ideology of multiculturalism, which
represents the development and organization of institutions and
societies that include on an equal basis African Americans and their
culture in white-dominated societies. Multiculturalism included other
ethnicities and people of color. Ideology is relevant because the
concept significantly explains the materialization and perpetuation of
white supremacy. The ideas of white supremacy diffuse from powerful
individuals and settle upon subordinates. [The [theory of white
supremacy began with imperial,]{.mark} national, or [**intellectual**
leadership]{.mark} and [**percolated** down to the masses.]{.mark} In
the United States, the framing of ideology applicable to race relations
originated at the top of the political structure and diffused to the
bottom social realms of the population. The writers of the U.S.
Constitution codified Black inferiority during the mid-1770s to late
1780s]{.underline}. Instead of legislation requiring states to take the
census of 100 percent of the Black population, Article 1, Section 2,
Clause 3 of the Constitution authorized states to count enslaved people
as representing only three-fifths of the total Black population. [Other
[early constitutional provisions were]{.mark} also **[racist]{.mark}**.
Congress prohibited states from outlawing the trade of enslaved
Africans, required white people to return the captured escaped-enslaved
to their masters, and embedded the federal government with the power to
suppress insurrections by the enslaved. State [legislatures and federal
courts **undergirded white supremacy**]{.mark} with the enactment or
support of racist laws, such as the separation of Blacks and whites in
public spaces. White supremacists committed murder, [physical]{.mark}
violence, rape, political oppression, [and]{.mark} [psychological
abuse]{.mark} against Black people. As racial integration began to
emerge, **[anti-Blackness gradually became less overt]{.mark}**, but
African Americans were denied favorable treatment and access to
decision-making positions. The [theory of ideological heg]{.mark}emony
[materializes when a populous takes part in **reinforcing** power
structures]{.mark} and societal ideas willingly, even when the
structures and ideas only marginally benefit those without meaningful
access to power. **[Social groups embrace ideological heg]{.mark}**emony
despite its capability to harm or silence dissent.]{.underline} Gramsci
wrote in one of the sections of the Notebooks that [the government is
responsible of hegemony. "...to gain the upper hand, to propagate itself
throughout society... and thus **[creating the hegemony of a fundamental
social group over a series of subordinate groups]{.mark}**..... It is
true that the State is seen as the organ of one particular group,
destined to create favourable conditions for the latter's maximum
expansion..."1 In colonial America, the political and military elite
established dominant domestic power and held onto it in part by
convincing the masses to accept their versions of reality, among which
were proclamations of an exploitative British monarch, victimized
colonists, superior white men, and inferior people of color. [The
ideologies disseminated]{.mark} in written form but mostly
**[orally]{.mark}** and consistently. Over time, white people and Black
people interpreted the ideas of race relations as commonplace. By then
coercion of the white masses was unnecessary.]{.underline} Authorities
used intimidation and force against Black people to accept white
supremacy. [The elite continuously encouraged the ideology of the
superiority of white people and their culture and the inferiority of
people of color and their ways of life]{.underline}. Hall said the
government is not always the reason the public adopts certain belief
structures. Ideological hegemony often originates with the elite private
sector. ["[It is]{.mark} quite [easy to see why]{.mark} [the only
ideology that gets **reproduced is the dominant one.**]{.mark} But the
far more pertinent, but difficult, question is how a society allows the
relative freedom of civil institutions to operate in the ideological
field, day after day, without direction or compulsion by the
State.]{.underline}"2 When assessing the validity of a claim, the
enlightened might say that a scholar's intellectual viewpoint should be
considered separately from his or her personal beliefs.
[[Intellectualism includes]{.mark} well **[thought out
propositions]{.mark}**, sometimes based on the results of
an]{.underline} analysis of empirical data. To the contrary,
[[beliefs]{.mark} are **[rooted in cultural practices]{.mark}** that are
personal, deeply felt, and sometimes unprovable.]{.underline} Gramsci's
views on the distribution of power and influence changed the formulation
of a wave of scholarship concerning ideological hegemony that evolved
between the 1850s to the 1960s. Gramsci proposed [that the [ideas of the
powerful are diffused]{.mark} and [maintained among]{.mark} groups who
are oppressed or otherwise [powerless**.** ]{.mark}Ideological hegemony
is also applicable to race relations in the late 1960s and early 1970s
during which racial integration began to occur in American
institutions.]{.underline} With that said, one might argue that
Gramsci's personal viewpoint on Black people too should be separated
from his intellectual analysis. Gramsci's Eurocentrism contained some of
the same negative views of Africans and African Americans as the
segregationists in the south.3 Gramsci's writing included his personal
expression of ideological hegemony applicable to the relationships
between powerful white men and the formally enslaved African Americans
whose lineage Gramsci suggests was backward. One further phenomenon in
the United States is worth studying, and that is the formation of a
surprising number of negro intellectuals who absorb American culture and
technology. It is worth bearing in mind the indirect influence that
these negro intellectuals could exercise on the backward masses in
Africa, and indeed direct influence if one or another of these
hypotheses were ever to be verified: 1. that American expansionism
should use American negroes as its agents in the conquest of the African
market and the extension of American civilization.4 Gramsci's position
on the then-modern relationship whites foisted on Blacks coincides with
the views of critics of race relations in the United States. Gramsci
also wrote that powerful white Americans reserved decision-making
authority for Caucasians, who limited the progression of Black people.
"It seems to me that, for the moment, American negroes have a national
and racial spirit which is negative rather than positive, one which is a
product of the struggle carried on by the whites in order to isolate and
depress them."5 Gramsci also wrote of his interpretation that Africans,
Black people in the United States by extension, that they were devoid of
intellect. He said Africans lived in a state of ignorance that Europeans
discovered upon their first encounters with them on the African
continent. "One got the impression that it was all rather like the first
contacts of English merchants and the negroes of Africa: trashy baubles
were handed out in exchange for nuggets of gold."6 In other words,
Gramsci suggests that African Americans, the decedents of ignorant
Africans, existed devoid of intellectual prowess. Therefore, Caucasians
were justified with excluding Black people from realms wherein white
people practiced ideological hegemony: the superior Caucasians and
inferior Black people[. The [**concept of racism** employed the same
mechanism as **ideological hegemony**]{.mark} wherein the purveyors of
dominant idealistic power transferred racists ideas from the upper-class
to the lower-classes. At the level of the upper class, systemic racism
represents a series of actions of interacting mechanisms wherein white
leadership made available opportunities exclusive of Black
people]{.underline}. Institutional racism, on the other hand, refers to
leaders of organizations or operations that distribute opportunities and
services inequitably based on race. Institutional racism is the
mechanism by which systemic racism functions. Education, healthcare,
financing, and justice are among the institutions providing societal
resources that Caucasians reserved for white people. [The [concept of
ideological heg]{.mark}emony preceded that of racism, but it [laid the
foundation]{.mark} on **[which racism rested]{.mark}** and explains why
white leaders drastically delayed opening institutions to Black people
to work at professional functions.]{.underline}

Methodology This study takes a critical hermeneutical approach.
According to Gallagher (1992) critical or depth hermeneutics is
concerned with engaging ideology critique. He notes that, "[critique
calls for a special and suspicious interpretation of those ideologies
and institutions which support and maintain ruling power
structures]{.underline}" (Gallagher, 1992, p. 240). He cites [four
[guiding principles related to]{.mark} critical **[hermeneutics: 1)
reproduction, 2) hegemony, 3) critical reflection and 4)
application.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Drawing from Habermas, Gallagher
states that the [purpose of critical interpretation is not simply to
attempt to reproduce original meaning but rather to **[interrogate
ideological positions]{.mark}** presented in texts]{.underline}. A
[critical or depth hermeneutic methodological approach proposes that
reproduction of texts [without any critical reflection]{.mark} on
[ideological representation]{.mark} only **[serves to maintain unequal
power relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This [stands in sharp contrast
to traditional methodologies that follow strict [non-critical,
non-reflective approaches]{.mark} concerned with reproducing the
supposedly pure words of the texts (or in the case of empirical
research, the voice/s of the subject/s of study). Related to the second
principle, hegemony]{.underline}, a depth hermeneutical approach would
take the perspective that ideology is embedded within linguistic
symbols. Once again, drawing from Habermas, Gallagher notes that
[problematic ideology distorts and serves the purpose of maintaining
oppressive social relations.]{.underline} Critical hermeneutics is
concerned with undistorting distorted communication, which takes place
through engaging in ideological critique. In other words, depth
hermeneutics questions the meaning behind linguistic symbols and to what
extent does the meaning collude in the reproduction of oppression. The
third principle, critical reflection places the interpreter in
relationship to that being interpreted. Gallagher states that "the
purpose of critical reflection is to assist in the achievement of
emancipation the objectivity of interpretation is seen either as a tool
to be used in the pursuit of emancipation or as a result of
emancipation, but not as an end in itself (p.244). The fourth principle
of critical hermeneutics is application or the idea that there exists
ideal undistorted communication, which we strive to achieve. A critical
hermeneutic approach is guided by the pursuit of freedom and
transformation. In reflecting on Habermas‟ and the principle of
application, Gallagher (1992) writes, For Habermas, application, which
is the result of critical interpretation in the sense that it always
comes along with the practice of depth hermeneutics, involves an escape
from prejudice, a radical modification of the anterior relation with the
tradition process. The "deep" meaning discovered by the critically
suspicious interpretation is not only enlightening but also emancipation
for the interpreter. (p. 246) My methodological framework, depth
hermeneutics, is grounded by Derrick Bell‟s [theory of racial realism
(1992). This theory [makes us aware of]{.mark} the **[real
dynamic]{.mark}** and effects **[of a racialized social system]{.mark}**
for Blacks. Although race may be a social construct, the social
[outcomes produce concrete forms of inequality]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Bell also concludes that racism has such a dynamic in our society that
it is unlikely that Blacks will achieve full equality since American
society is premised upon a system of white supremacist domination. This
[ideology penetrates American consciousness to the point that no
institution, individual or group has not been touched or affected by it.
**[Racism will always re-invent itself]{.mark}** in such a way as to
maintain the hierarchy and the subordinate status of
Blacks]{.underline}. Thus, with each racial gain achieved by Blacks,
there are subsequent setbacks. [We can see the [evidence of this
in]{.mark} the aftermath of the [Civil Rights]{.mark} Movement. Of
course, the movement led to significant gains for Blacks. However,
antidiscriminatory laws have not successfully leveled the playing field.
Furthermore, in recent decades we have witnessed some backlash against
any goals or principles that might presumably lead to any potential
advantage for Blacks. We see how the language of the Civil Rights
Movement and subsequent laws are currently being used to deter from the
goal of racial equality and now a racial hierarchy. [Racial realism
tells us]{.mark} that [we must acknowledge]{.mark} the **[historical
endurance of anti-Black racism]{.mark}** and understand that it has
often been disguised.]{.underline} This is particularly true in our
contemporary age of colorblind race politics. Therefore, we must be
mindful of how anti-Blackness manifests in the postCivil Rights era. A
study influenced by racial realism would critique the idea of abstract
neutrality or pure deductive reasoning, and instead acknowledge that
research is also interpreted through social knowledge. A study grounded
in a racial realist approach would work toward exposing and confronting
anti-Black ideology in fields of thought that collude in the
perpetuation of a racial hierarchy. For example, from a racial realist
perspective [even those discourses that are presented as "critical" or
still yet "anti-racist" discourses may also be complicit in the
preservation of anti-Black ideology. This means that even presumably
critical discourses on race must be studied from the perspective that
they take a particular social position]{.underline}, also understand
Blacks from a particular social position and maneuver theoretically
based upon that understanding. Racial realism is premised upon
ideological critique. My [study is rooted in this method of inquiry. In
Ideology and Modern Culture]{.underline}, Jon Thompson (1990) highlights
the debate in defining the notion of ideology. Ideology has its origins
in Marxist theory and the idea of false consciousness. Ideology is seen
as negative in that it supports the status quo and delimits the
**[[development of counter-hegemonic
consciousness]{.mark}]{.underline}** among the working class. Ideology
illusively hides unequal relations of power between dominant and
subordinate groups. Other theoretical perspectives propose that ideology
is neutral, moving away from the purely pejorative connotation.
Ideologies can be regarded then as „systems of thought‟, „systems of
belief‟, or „symbolic systems‟ which pertain to social action or
political stance" (Thompson, 1990, p.5). In this light, all political
action and thought is ideological. I concur with Thompson‟s (1990)
critical conception of ideology in which he finds that, [the analysis of
ideology is primarily concerned with the ways in which forms intersect
with relations of power. It is concerned with the ways in which meaning
is mobilized in the social world and serves thereby to bolster up
individuals and groups who occupy positions of power. To study ideology
is to study the ways in which meaning serves to establish and sustain
relations of domination. Ideological phenomena are meaningful symbolic
phenomena in so far as they serve, in particular social historical
circumstances, to establish and sustain relations of
domination.]{.underline} (p.56) Nicolas Burbules (1995) proposes five
forms of ideology critique including (1) scientific, (2) immanent, (3)
deconstructionist, (4) argument from effects, and (5) counter-ideology[.
Scientific critiques see ideologies as distorted and irrational. They
examine ideologies for the ways in which they distort the truth.
Immanent critiques reveal how ideologies often do not "measure up to
their own standards" (p.57). The critic reveals the contradictions that
belie a particular standpoint or position. Burbules states that the
third form, the deconstructivist approach, takes the position that there
are no universal truths or metanarratives.]{.underline} The fourth form
of ideological critique, argument from effects, takes the stand that we
must examine the outcome or consequences of ideological positions and
then critique those that uphold domination or perpetuate unequal systems
of power. The final form of critique is counter-ideology, which proposes
that ideological critic challenge ideologies with other
counter-hegemonic ideologies. Burbules (1995) notes that there are both
possibilities in and limitations to each form of ideological critique he
describes[. He proposes that we [approach the process from]{.mark} the
perspective of critiquing ideology as **[a way of working on developing
critical thought]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Additionally, he proposes that
the work of the ideological critic is to understand people on their own
terms, in their journey towards changing perspectives as they are
introduced to new ways of thinking about the world. And while, as an
educator, I do tend to concur to some degree with the position, I
strongly disagree with his presupposition that we must not refute
ideologies but rather attempt to induce people towards transformative
thinking. For instance[, I see my role as ideological critic as one that
is guided by racial realism]{.underline} and the commitment to refute
and challenge forms of antiBlackness or what I see as ideologies that
uphold the oppression and subjugation of Black people. By intersecting
racial realism with ideological critique I propose a study that will
critique the presence of anti-Black ideology in post-Civil Rights racial
discourses on multiracialism, culture, and those defined as moving
beyond the Black/white paradigms (e.g., LatCrit and AsianCrit). I have
selected these fields of thought because they represent contemporary
discourses on race that purported reject binary racial thinking in an
attempt to offer new theoretical insight into U.S. race relations. Each
field of thought dedicates substantial scholarship to problematizing the
presence of Blackness in U.S. racial thought. Though individual texts
were selected and interpreted in relationship to anti-Black ideology,
taken as a whole, these texts represent a larger pervasive anti-Black
discourse that works to sustain the racial hierarchy. As an ideological
critic I am concerned with challenging ideology that sustains unequal
power relations. Anti-Black discourse sustains a racial hierarchy that
places Blacks at the bottom. My responsibility as an ideological critic
is to unpack that ideology colluding in the oppression of Blacks. As
Thompson (1990) states, ideological critique proposes a contestation or
challenge to systems of domination by unveiling precisely how they
manifest, are defended and also become unquestionably part of social
reality. I first will begin with a review of literature comprising the
following areas: racial hierarchy in the post-Civil Rights era;
globalized anti-Blackness; ethnicity and the structure of racism; and
the construction of the Black body.

in Zimbabwe, focusing \[A call for abolition: The disavowal and
displacement of race in critical security studies\] neil

Security Dialogue's call comes out of a **[wider move to include race in
discussions of international relations]{.underline}**, amid calls **[to
'decolonize' a discipline that has always been at the heart of colonial
power structures]{.underline}** ([Sabaratnam,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)).
Yet, in order to understand **[what is at stake in this
move]{.underline}** to include race in a discipline that formerly seemed
to ignore it, **[we must consider the relationship between Blackness and
the world]{.underline}**, the ontological condition that makes
anti-Blackness inextricable from security. In short, we must realize
that questions of race and racism have always been the ground that
critical security studies stands on. **[The idea that racism can be
isolated and extracted from an academic discipline while its effects are
therapeutically addressed is challenged]{.underline}**
**[by]{.underline}** the weight of **[Afropessimist
scholarship]{.underline}**, critical Black feminist and anti-colonial
thinking. The urge to 'decolonize' academia suggests that coloniality is
a condition that can be uprooted within the university without
addressing the broader anti-Black world that universities are in. Some
prominent decolonial scholars have challengingly argued that
'decolonization is not a metaphor' ([Tuck and Yang,
2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)),
and **[others have suggested the need for pluriversal approaches to
security that allow for inclusion of a multitude of non-Western
ontologies]{.underline}** ([Escobar,
2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)).
However, **[even pluriversal approaches risk retaining parts of the
edifice of modernity without addressing its anti-Black
foundations]{.underline}**, **[leaving open the possibility of
're-enchanting and pluralising]{.underline}** \[international
relations\]' (Rothe, 2019: 9), **[assuming that redemption and
reparation is possible]{.underline}**. The temporality at stake is that
which **[seeks to salvage 'critique' through an imaginary telos of
progress -- learning the lessons and moving onwards, ever opening and
exploring new avenues and new approaches]{.underline}** -- hence **[the
appeal to an ethico-political 'openness' that the making of reparative
politics is held to enable.]{.underline}** This **[attempt to move
'beyond' the problem of 'the spectres of race and racism']{.underline}**
is laudable but, we argue, misguided. **[It is precisely critical
narratives of 'progress' that critical Black studies and Afropessimism
seek to problematize]{.underline}** ([Ray et al.,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)).
**[Rather]{.underline}** than considering **[anti-Blackness as an
epiphenomenon of modernity, a glitch in our system that needs to be
fixed]{.underline}**, **[it may be understood as constitutive of a
modern ontology]{.underline}** ([Wilderson,
2010](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)).
As [Nahum Dimitri Chandler
(2014](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
130) states, 'there is no contemporary discourse that is free or
independent of the itinerary of the concept of race'. **[The existence
of Blackness is ontologically crucial in providing the boundaries of
humanity, in creating the Outside, the Other, that is necessary to
define the inside of modernity, civil society and human
subjectivity]{.underline}** ([Warren,
2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)).
As [Saidiya Hartman
(2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
33) argues, '**[the texture of freedom is laden with the vestiges of
slavery, and abstract equality is utterly enmeshed in the narrative of
black subjection']{.underline}**. Thus, for Afropessimists, it **[is not
merely the contemporary order of humanity that is enmeshed with
anti-Blackness]{.underline}**, **[but]{.underline}** also
**[the]{.underline}** **[struggles for emancipation by those within that
order]{.underline}**. This does not mean that there is no oppression
among those who are recognized as human, but that their struggles for
freedom within this space are of a different order from that of Black
people, as the space of these internal conflicts is constituted by
anti-Blackness. In order for there to be security for humanity, in order
for the liberal subject, civil society and a world of progress to
function, Blackness must remain outside, as the counterpoint to the
telos of modernity. This **[throws into question calls for inclusion,
for justice and for reparation]{.underline}**, **[as well as the ability
for the global system to be accountable for the suffering and death of
Black people]{.underline}**. If anti-Blackness is a structural necessity
for the system to exist**[, then there can be no justice, no end to
violence against Black people if the current system
persists.]{.underline}** The drive to include Black people in civil
society, to promote multiculturalism, diversity and inclusion, **[leaves
untouched the ontological condition of Blackness, which is required to
maintain the borders of humanity]{.underline}**. The radical force of
**[Black liberation movements was blunted by the drive to assimilate
them, to include Black people in the political sphere, to recognize and
celebrate their 'ethnic identity', without addressing the fundamental
condition of Blackness]{.underline}**. In the USA, anti-Black violence
remains a necessity to maintain security, despite the inclusion of Black
people at all levels of government. Inclusivity does not ameliorate the
problem; it merely obfuscates it. As [Frank Wilderson
(2010](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
103) argues, **['few characters aestheticize White supremacy more
effectively and persuasively than a Black male cop']{.underline}**.
American governance is not 'haunted' by race, it is constituted through
race. Thus the line between humanity and Blackness is not shattered
through the inclusion of some Black people in the space of civil
society; rather, it is reinforced. In South Africa, the Black
inhabitants of townships continue to endure state violence and poverty
despite the formal end of apartheid. Black activists now protest against
their government by 'black boers' (settlers), those who have crossed the
line into humanity only to fortify it against their former compatriots
([Madlingozi,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)).
This is because, as [Tsepho Madlingozi
(2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
14) argues, 'the main edifice of the ontological structure of
colonial-apartheid . . . remains in place'. In order to ensure the
security of settler society, those few who have been inducted into it
must maintain the violence of the anti-Black order that is said to be
overturned. **[Security, then, is sustained through
anti-Blackness]{.underline}**, for if the abject non-subject of the
Black experience does not exist as a point of contrast, then humanity
cannot be safe. The subjectivity of the (non-Black) human is imperilled,
without the safety of anti-Black violence that ensures its ontological
integrity. If this is the case, then we must re-read the call to bring
considerations of race and racism into critical security studies and
question the feasibility of achieving an ethico-political reparation in
a discipline that relies on the structure of an anti-Black system.
Disavowal: 'Spectres' and 'foundations' Having grasped the nature of the
relationship between anti-Blackness and security, let us reflect on the
assumptions underpinning the desire to rejuvenate the criticality of the
field through reparative approaches to race. We see a potential problem
with the argument that the recent important work by the scholars
like [Sabaratnam
(2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413) and [Rutazibwa
(2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413) on
**[security's racial underpinnings has cleared the ground for a project
of accounting and reparation while maintaining existing academic fields
recognizably intac]{.underline}**t. Indeed, recent work on race in
security and global politics has highlighted many potential issues,
demonstrating the substantial challenge facing reparative projects.
As [Anna Agathangelou and Kyle Killian
(2016)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413) demonstrate,
considered ontologically, coloniality is much more than a set of space-
and time-specific policy practices, but rather a world-making (and
worlds-destroying) practice through which our understanding of global
space and time is constructed (see also [Grovogui,
2014](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413); [Jackson,
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413); [Silva,
2007](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)).
Moreover, critical sociological accounts of security and international
relations argue that the imposition of racial difference is intimately
tied to colonial and settler-colonial power as a technique of control
and regulation that naturalizes and reproduces differential powers and
capacities (e.g. [Henderson,
2013](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413); [Nisancioglu,
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)).
**[Race and white supremacy are thus inextricable from hegemonic regimes
of power and imposition, at the heart of the discipline, despite the
abstract categories of liberal political theory that structurally
operate to occlude the centrality of race to contemporary political
divisions and understandings.]{.underline}** As [Gurminder Bhambra
argues
(2017)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413),
the location of race is often displaced -- to claims to identity and
difference, seen to be racial -- while white-coded framings of
'sovereignty' and 'class' obscure their racialized grounding. T**[his
important work on the nature of race and racism in security studies
shows that the problem is not so much one of a lack of incorporation of
questions of race and racism, but rather that of a thoroughgoing
saturation in issues of race]{.underline}**. **[This ontological
saturation implies that there can be no definitive temporal break
between the colonial past and a postcolonial present.]{.underline}**
**[Coloniality remains]{.underline}** in the present not only in
residue, but rather **[as an 'ongoing and quotidian
atrocity']{.underline}**, inevitably problematizing attempts at
reparation (see discussion in [Sharpe,
2016](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
20). We are thereby fully sympathetic to [Howell and Richter-Montpetit's
(2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413) understanding
that 'questions of race and racism' cannot be disentangled from critical
security studies or, for that matter, the broader field of international
relations. As [Jared Sexton
(2008](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
22) powerfully notes, **[any attempt to separate 'questions of race and
racism' from systems, structures and institutions of power already risks
disavowing the centrality of race and its reduction to a secondary or
contingent aspect.]{.underline}**

London. His thesis research investigated the relationship between
international development donors and local civil society organisations
in Zimbabwe, focusing \[A call for abolition: The disavowal and
displacement of race in critical security studies\] neil

We have seen above that **[disavowal operates on the basis of
stipulating that the problem of race and racism is one that can be
located in the past, intimating that the problem is a difficult one of
'spectres' or legacies that must and can be overcome]{.underline}**.
This is possible **[because the assumption is that questions of race are
somehow separable from the field of critical security studies itself,
rather than constitutive of i]{.underline}**t. The successful
**[accomplishment of disavowal, then, enables a focus upon how critical
security studies might move forwa]{.underline}**rd. This leap, we argue,
is a displacement that then puts questions of the future of critical
security studies at the forefront of concern. **[The displacement
accomplishes the inversing of the problematic: critical security studies
is now the solution rather than the problem.]{.underline}** The
precondition for reparative work is the disavowal that race and racism
are inextricably entangled with critical security studies. The shift of
displacement **[is the move to reparation, the imaginary of an anti- or
non-racist critical security studies]{.underline}**.

The problem with this move of displacement is that the ethico-political
stance of reparation is necessarily an affirmative one. As [Eve Kosofsky
Sedgwick
(2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
150--151) suggests, it is through this displacement that we can learn
from the 'ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance
from the objects of a culture -- even of a culture whose avowed desire
has often been not to sustain them'. As Tiffany Lethabo King powerfully
argues, while it is the case that reading 'for what is generative and
provides openings' ([King,
2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
230n74) is vital for coalition and collaboration, reparative work
advocated in LGBT and queer theory presupposes the positionality of a
shared humanist sexual subject position. As [Fred Moten
(2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
11--12) notes in his essay on race and the work of Levinas, the
reparative stance of being 'open to the world' or 'available to the
world' **[can only work as a critical project for those for whom the
world is accessible in these ways]{.underline}**. **[For those
structurally excluded from this political ontology of the
subject]{.underline}**, this **[openness would be critical only insofar
as relationality is understood]{.underline}** to be an expression of
power, **[structured by the givenness of a transcendental subjectivity
that the black cannot have]{.underline}** but by which the black can be
had; **[a structural position that he or she cannot take]{.underline}**
but by which he or she can be taken. ([Moten,
2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
204)

Any project of reparative work for generative ethico-political openings
**[would have to be undertaken after the abolition or dismantling of
critical security studies]{.underline}**, **[not as a substitute for
this, displacing the problem to that of the repair of the disciplinary
field]{.underline}**.

Reparative work proffered from within a system where race is not merely
the 'oil' in the engine but the engine itself offers little hope of real
change. How can critical security studies offer a space for a new
antiracist political ethics, from within the wider 'prison of colonial

Surely, if reparative work is to be undertaken, **[it should be carried
out on the terms of those who are wronged, rather than on the grounds of
the perpetrator of the offence]{.underline}**. If **[critical security

of the humanity from which Blackness has always been excluded, then
**[it cannot ameliorate the oppression that was required to clear that

Instead, we might follow [Alexander Weheliye
(2014](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
137) in arguing that humanity, the idea of the 'human', can only be
overhauled from without, transformed by those who, he argues, 'live
behind the veil of the permanent state of exception'. Thus, we might
argue that reparation ultimately leads us back to subjection
(see [Coulthard,

'**[Questions of race and racism' are not the spectre haunting critical

reparative access to 'questions of race and racism' no matter how hard
or how genuinely it tries. '**[Questions of race and racism' are what
enable the cuts and binaries, the world, the subjects, the concerns, the
practices, the methods, the understandings of critical security
studies]{.underline}**. Critical. Security. Studies. What is it about
these three words, singularly, together, in whatever order, that could
make anyone think, in today's world, there was a way beyond their
imbrications in 'questions of race and racism'? Critical of what? On
what grounds? Security of what? On what grounds? Study of what? On what
grounds? Answer: the grounds of anti-Blackness or 'questions of race and
racism'.

Being critical necessitates having a standpoint, being a subject in
relation. For the white world of modernity, critical standpoints enabled
the overturning of the relation, freeing the subject from its
oppression, alienation or exploitation. As [Frank B. Wilderson
(2010](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
37) notes, **[these 'grammars of suffering' are grounded upon
anti-Blackness, grounded upon the construction of the human as an
abstract, autonomous, interest-bearing, rational subject]{.underline}**.
Wilderson argues that the exclusion of Blackness from humanity was
required as a counterpart, an outside that allowed for the construction
of the modern human subject. Thus, **[critique, in the sense of striving
for emancipation under the conditions of modernity, is ontologically
grounded in anti-Blackness]{.underline}**. For '**[critique', then,
'questions of race and racism' are problems of management and damage
limitation, problems of experience not problems of
ontology]{.underline}**. **[Addressing 'questions of race and racism' is
the form that governance takes, the practice of grounding this
governance itself. Critique is what puts anti-Blackness to work in its
ceaseless desire to reproduce itself, to improve, to better, to be more
adaptive, to be more inclusive -- ever changing, ever learning, ever
transforming]{.underline}**. Therefore, the mere inclusion of questions
of race and racism, which maintain the ontological structure of
anti-Blackness, must perpetuate an anti-Black world. Critique is **[the
endless search for the emancipation of the huma]{.underline}**n, the
quest for the realization of the full potential of an anti-Black world.
The flight of critique today can be rewritten as **[the perpetual denial

#### Ethical AI discourse is a façade -- only serves to stall tech regulations

**OCHIGAME 19** - Rodrigo Ochigame - PhD candidate in science,
technology, and society at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
and a former researcher of artificial intelligence at the MIT Media Lab,
12-20-2019, \"How Big Tech Manipulates Academia to Avoid Regulation,\"
Intercept,
https://theintercept.com/2019/12/20/mit-ethical-ai-artificial-intelligence///vi

THE IRONY OF the ethical scandal enveloping Joichi Ito, the former
director of the MIT Media Lab, is that he used to lead academic
initiatives on ethics. After the revelation of his financial ties to
Jeffrey Epstein, the financier charged with sex trafficking underage
girls as young as 14, Ito resigned from multiple roles at MIT, a
visiting professorship at Harvard Law School, and the boards of the John
D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the John S. and James L.
Knight Foundation, and the New York Times Company. Many spectators are
puzzled by Ito's influential role as an ethicist of artificial
intelligence. Indeed, his initiatives were crucial in establishing the
[discourse of "ethical AI" that is now ubiquitous in academia and in the
mainstream press. In 2016]{.underline}, then-President Barack Obama
described him as an "expert" on AI and ethics. Since 2017, Ito financed
many projects through the \$27 million Ethics and Governance of AI Fund,
an initiative anchored by the MIT Media Lab and the Berkman Klein Center
for Internet and Society at Harvard University. What was all the talk of
"ethics" really about? For 14 months, I worked as a graduate student
researcher in Ito's group on AI ethics at the Media Lab. I stopped on
August 15, immediately after Ito published his initial "apology"
regarding his ties to Epstein, in which he acknowledged accepting money
from the financier both for the Media Lab and for Ito's outside venture
funds. Ito did not disclose that Epstein had, at the time this money
changed hands, already pleaded guilty to a child prostitution charge in
Florida, or that Ito took numerous steps to hide Epstein's name from
official records, as The New Yorker later revealed. The discourse of
"ethical AI" was aligned strategically with a Silicon Valley effort
seeking to avoid legally enforceable restrictions of controversial
technologies. Inspired by whistleblower Signe Swenson and others who
have spoken out, I have decided to report what I came to learn regarding
Ito's role in shaping the field of AI ethics, since this is a matter of
public concern. The [emergence of this field is a recent phenomenon, as
past AI researchers had been largely uninterested in the study of
ethics.]{.underline} A former Media Lab colleague recalls that Marvin
Minsky, the deceased AI pioneer at MIT, used to say that "an ethicist is
someone who has a problem with whatever you have in your mind." (In
recently unsealed court filings, victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre
testified that Epstein directed her to have sex with Minsky.) Why, then,
did AI researchers suddenly start talking about ethics? At the Media
Lab, I learned [that the [discourse of "ethical AI,"]{.mark} championed
substantially by Ito, [was aligned strategically with a **Silicon
Valley**]{.mark} effort seeking **[to avoid legally enforceable
restrictions of controversial tech]{.mark}**nologies]{.underline}. A key
group behind this effort, with the lab as a member, made policy
recommendations in California that contradicted the conclusions of
research I conducted with several lab colleagues, research that led us
to oppose the use of computer algorithms in deciding whether to jail
people pending trial. Ito himself would eventually complain, in private
meetings with financial and tech executives, that the group's
recommendations amounted to "whitewashing" a thorny ethical issue. "They
water down stuff we try to say to prevent the use of algorithms that
don't seem to work well" in detention decisions, he confided to one
billionaire. I also watched MIT help the U.S. military brush aside the
moral complexities of drone warfare, hosting a superficial talk on AI
and ethics by Henry Kissinger, [the former secretary of state and
notorious war criminal, and giving input on the U.S. Department of
Defense's "[AI]{.mark} Ethics [Principles" for warfare]{.mark}, which
embraced "permissibly biased" algorithms and which [avoided using the
word "fairness]{.mark}" because [the Pentagon believes]{.mark} "that
**[fights should not be fair."]{.mark}**]{.underline} Ito did not
respond to requests for comment. Joichi Ito, director of MIT Media Lab,

CREDIBILITY to the idea that big tech could police its own use of
artificial intelligence at a time when the industry faced increasing
criticism and calls for legal regulation. Just in 2018, there were
several controversies: Facebook's breach of private data on more than 50
million users to a political marketing firm hired by Donald Trump's
presidential campaign, revealed in March 2018; Google's contract with
the Pentagon for computer vision software to be used in combat zones,
revealed that same month; Amazon's sale of facial recognition technology
to police departments, revealed in May; Microsoft's contract with the
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement revealed in June; and IBM's
secret collaboration with the New York Police Department for facial
recognition and racial classification in video surveillance footage,
revealed in September. [Under the slogan #TechWontBuildIt, thousands of
workers at these firms have organized protests and circulated petitions
against such contracts. From #NoTechForICE to #Data4BlackLives, several
grassroots campaigns have demanded legal restrictions of some uses of
computational technologies (e.g., forbidding the use of facial
recognition by police). Meanwhile, corporations have tried to shift the
discussion to focus on voluntary "ethical principles," "responsible
practices," and technical adjustments or "safeguards" framed in terms of
"bias" and "fairness" (e.g., requiring or encouraging police to adopt
"unbiased" or "fair" facial recognition). In January 2018, Microsoft
published its "ethical principles" for AI, starting with "fairness." In
May, Facebook announced its "commitment to the ethical development and
deployment of AI" and a tool to "search for bias" called "Fairness
Flow." In June, Google published its "responsible practices" for AI
research and development. In September, IBM announced a tool called "AI
Fairness 360," designed to "check for unwanted bias in datasets and
machine learning models." In January 2019, Facebook granted \$7.5
million for the creation of an AI ethics center in Munich, Germany. In
March, Amazon co-sponsored a \$20 million program on "fairness in AI"
with the U.S. National Science Foundation. In April, Google canceled its
AI ethics council after backlash over the selection of Kay Coles James,
the vocally anti-trans president of the right-wing Heritage
Foundation.]{.underline} These corporate initiatives frequently cited
academic research that Ito had supported, at least partially, through
the MIT-Harvard fund. To characterize the corporate agenda, [it is
helpful to distinguish between [three kinds of regulatory possibilities
for]{.mark} a given [tech]{.mark}nology: (**[1) no legal
regulation]{.mark}** at all, [leaving "ethical principles]{.mark}" and
"responsible practices" as merely [voluntary]{.mark}; (2) [moderate
legal reg]{.mark}ulation [encouraging]{.mark} or requiring
[tech]{.mark}nical [adjustments]{.mark} that do not conflict
significantly with profits; **[or (3) restrictive legal
regulation]{.mark}** curbing or **[banning deployment of the technology.
Unsurprisingly, the tech industry]{.mark}** tends to support the first
two and **[oppose the last]{.mark}**. The [corporate-sponsored
discourse]{.mark} of "ethical AI" **[enables precisely this
position.]{.mark}** Consider the case of facial
recognition]{.underline}. This year, the municipal legislatures of San
Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley --- all in California --- plus
Somerville, Massachusetts, have passed strict bans on facial recognition
technology. Meanwhile, [Microsoft has lobbied in favor of less
restrictive legislation, requiring technical adjustments such as tests
for "bias," most notably in Washington state. Some big firms may even
prefer this kind of mild legal regulation over a complete lack thereof,
since larger firms can more easily invest in specialized teams to
develop systems that comply with regulatory requirements.]{.underline}
Thus, [Silicon Valley's vigorous promotion of "ethical AI" has
constituted [a strategic lobbying effort, one that]{.mark} has
**[enrolled academia to legitimize itself]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Ito
played a key role in this corporate-academic fraternizing, meeting
regularly with tech executives. The MIT-Harvard fund's initial director
was the former "global public policy lead" for AI at Google. Through the
fund, Ito and his associates sponsored many projects, including the
creation of a prominent conference on "Fairness, Accountability, and
Transparency" in computer science; other sponsors of the conference
included Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. Although the Silicon Valley
lobbying effort has consolidated academic interest in "ethical AI" and
"fair algorithms" since 2016, a handful of papers on these topics had
appeared in earlier years, even if framed differently. For example,
Microsoft computer scientists published the paper that arguably
inaugurated the field of "algorithmic fairness" in 2012. In 2016, the
paper's lead author, Cynthia Dwork, became a professor of computer
science at Harvard, with simultaneous positions at its law school and at
Microsoft. When I took her Harvard course on the mathematical
foundations of cryptography and statistics in 2017, I interviewed her
and asked how she became interested in researching algorithmic
definitions of fairness. In her account, she had long been personally
concerned with the issue of discriminatory advertising, but Microsoft
managers encouraged her to pursue this line of work because the firm was
developing a new system of online advertising, and it would be
economically advantageous to provide a service "free of regulatory
problems." (To be fair, I believe that Dwork's personal intentions were
honest despite the corporate capture of her ideas. Microsoft declined to
comment for this article.) After the initial steps by MIT and Harvard,
many other universities and new institutes received money from the tech
industry to work on AI ethics. Most such organizations are also headed
by current or former executives of tech firms. For example, the Data &
Society Research Institute is directed by a Microsoft researcher and
initially funded by a Microsoft grant; New York University's AI Now
Institute was co-founded by another Microsoft researcher and partially
funded by Microsoft, Google, and DeepMind; the Stanford Institute for
Human-Centered AI is co-directed by a former vice president of Google;
University of California, Berkeley's Division of Data Sciences is headed
by a Microsoft veteran; and the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing is
headed by a board member of Amazon. During my time at the Media Lab, Ito
maintained frequent contact with the executives and planners of all
these organizations. Comp-7-for-spot-2-1576795206Illustration: Yoshi
Sodeoka for The Intercept BIG TECH MONEY and direction proved
incompatible with an honest exploration of ethics, at least judging from
my experience with the "Partnership on AI to Benefit People and
Society," a group founded by Microsoft, Google/DeepMind, Facebook, IBM,
and Amazon in 2016. PAI, of which the Media Lab is a member, defines
itself as a "multistakeholder body" and claims it is "not a lobbying
organization." In an April 2018 hearing at the U.S. House Committee on
Oversight and Government Reform, the Partnership's executive director
claimed that the organization is merely "a resource to policymakers ---
for instance, [in conducting research that informs AI best practices and
exploring the societal consequences of certain AI systems, as well as
policies around the development and use of AI systems." But even if the
Partnership's activities may not meet the legal threshold requiring
registration as lobbyists --- for example, by seeking to directly affect
the votes of individual elected officials --- the partnership has
certainly sought to influence legislation.]{.underline} For example, in
November 2018, the Partnership staff asked academic members to
contribute to a collective statement to the Judicial Council of
California regarding a Senate bill on penal reform (S.B. 10). The bill,
in the course of eliminating cash bail, expanded the use of algorithmic
risk assessment in pretrial decision making, and required the Judicial
Council to "address the identification and mitigation of any implicit
bias in assessment instruments." The Partnership staff wrote, "we
believe there is room to impact this legislation (and CJS \[criminal
justice system\] applications more broadly)." In December 2018, three
Media Lab colleagues and I raised serious objections to the
Partnership's efforts to influence legislation. We observed that the
Partnership's policy recommendations aligned consistently with the
corporate agenda. In the penal case, our research led us to strongly
oppose the adoption of risk assessment tools, and to reject the proposed
technical adjustments that would supposedly render them "unbiased" or
"fair." But the Partnership's draft statement seemed, as a colleague put
it in an internal email to Ito and others, to "validate the use of RA
\[risk assessment\] by emphasizing the issue as a technical one that can
therefore be solved with better data sets, etc." A second colleague
agreed that the "PAI statement is weak and risks doing exactly what
we've been warning against re: the risk of legitimation via these
industry led regulatory efforts." A third colleague wrote, "So far as
the criminal justice work is concerned, what PAI is doing in this realm
is quite alarming and also in my opinion seriously misguided. I agree
with Rodrigo that PAI's association with ACLU, MIT and other academic /
non-profit institutions practically ends up serving a legitimating
function. Neither ACLU nor MIT nor any non-profit has any power in PAI."
Worse, there seemed to be a mismatch between the Partnership's
recommendations and the efforts of a grassroots coalition of
organizations fighting jail expansion, including the movement Black
Lives Matter, the prison abolitionist group Critical Resistance (where I
have volunteered), and the undocumented and queer/trans youth-led
Immigrant Youth Coalition. The grassroots coalition argued, "The notion
that any risk assessment instrument can account for bias ignores the
racial disparities in current and past policing practices." There are
abundant theoretical and empirical reasons to support this claim, since
risk assessments are typically based on data of arrests, convictions, or
incarcerations, all of which are poor proxies for individual behaviors
or predispositions. The coalition continued, "Ultimately,
risk-assessment tools create a feedback-loop of racial profiling,
pre-trial detention and conviction. A person's freedom should not be
reduced to an algorithm." By contrast, the Partnership's statement
focused on "minimum requirements for responsible deployment," spanning
such topics as "validity and data sampling bias, bias in statistical
predictions; choice of the appropriate targets for prediction;
human-computer interaction questions; user training; policy and
governance; transparency and review; reproducibility, process, and
recordkeeping; and post-deployment evaluation." To be sure, the
Partnership staff did respond to criticism of the draft by noting in the
final version of the statement that "within PAI's membership and the
wider AI community, many experts further suggest that individuals can
never justly be detained on the basis of their risk assessment score
alone, without an individualized hearing." This meek concession ---
admitting that it might not be time to start imprisoning people based
strictly on software, without input from a judge or any other
"individualized" judicial process --- was easier to make because none of
the major firms in the Partnership sell risk assessment tools for
pretrial decision-making; not only is the technology too controversial
but also the market is too small. (Facial recognition technology, on the
other hand, has a much larger market in which Microsoft, Google,
Facebook, IBM, and Amazon all operate.) In December 2018, my colleagues
and I urged Ito to quit the Partnership. I argued, "If academic and
nonprofit organizations want to make a difference, the only viable
strategy is to quit PAI, make a public statement, and form a counter
alliance." Then a colleague proposed, "there are many other
organizations which are doing much more substantial and transformative
work in this area of predictive analytics in criminal justice --- what
would it look like to take the money we currently allocate in supporting
PAI in order to support their work?" We believed Ito had enough autonomy
to do so because the MIT-Harvard fund was supported largely by the
Knight Foundation, even though most of the money came from tech
investors Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, via the Omidyar Network, and
Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn and Microsoft board member. I
wrote, "If tens of millions of dollars from nonprofit foundations and
individual donors are not enough to allow us to take a bold position and
join the right side, I don't know what would be." (Omidyar funds The
Intercept.) It is strange that Ito, with no formal training, became
positioned as an "expert" on AI ethics, a field that barely existed
before 2017. Ito did acknowledge the problem. He had just received a
message from David M. Siegel, co-chair of the hedge fund Two Sigma and
member of the MIT Corporation. Siegel proposed a self-regulatory
structure for "search and social media" firms in Silicon Valley, modeled
after the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, a private
corporation that serves as a self-regulatory organization for securities
firms on Wall Street. Ito responded to Siegel's proposal, "I don't feel
civil society is well represented in the industry groups. We've been
participating in Partnership in AI and they water down stuff we try to
say to prevent the use of algorithms that don't seem to work well like
risk scores for pre-trial bail. I think that with personal data and
social media, I have concerns with self-regulation. For example, a full
blown genocide \[of the Rohingya, a mostly Muslim minority group in
Myanmar\] happened using What's App and Facebook knew it was happening."
(Facebook has admitted that its platform was used to incite violence in
Myanmar; news reports have documented how content on the Facebook
platform facilitated a genocide in the country despite repeated warnings
to Facebook executives from human rights activists and researchers.
Facebook texting service WhatsApp made it harder for its users to
forward messages after WhatsApp was reportedly used to spread
misinformation during elections in India.) But the corporate-academic
alliances were too robust and convenient. The Media Lab remained in the
Partnership, and Ito continued to fraternize with Silicon Valley and
Wall Street executives and investors. Ito described Siegel, a
billionaire, as a "potential funder." With such people, I saw Ito
routinely express moral concerns about their businesses --- but in a
friendly manner, as he was simultaneously asking them for money, whether
for MIT or his own venture capital funds. For corporate-academic
"ethicists," amicable criticism can serve as leverage for entering into
business relationships. Siegel replied to Ito, "I would be pleased to
speak more on this topic with you. Finra is not an industry group. It's
just paid for by industry. I will explain more when we meet. I agree
with your concerns." In private meetings, Ito and tech executives
discussed the corporate lobby quite frankly. In January, my colleagues
and I joined a meeting with Mustafa Suleyman, founding co-chair of the
Partnership and co-founder of DeepMind, an AI startup acquired by Google
for about \$500 million in 2014. In the meeting, Ito and Suleyman
discussed how the promotion of "AI ethics" had become a "whitewashing"
effort, although they claimed their initial intentions had been nobler.
In a message to plan the meeting, Ito wrote to my colleagues and me, "I
do know, however, from speaking to Mustafa when he was setting up PAI
that he was meaning for the group to be much more substantive and not
just 'white washing.' I think it's just taking the trajectory that these
things take." (Suleyman did not respond to requests for comment.)
REGARDLESS OF INDIVIDUAL actors' intentions, the [corporate lobby's
effort to shape academic research was extremely successful. There is now
an enormous amount of work under the rubric of "AI ethics." To be fair,
some of the research is useful and nuanced, especially in the humanities
and social sciences. But the majority of well-funded work on "ethical
AI" is aligned with the tech lobby's agenda: to voluntarily or
moderately adjust, rather than legally restrict, the deployment of
controversial technologies. How did five corporations, using only a
small fraction of their budgets, manage to influence and frame so much
academic activity, in so many disciplines, so quickly?]{.underline} It
is strange that Ito, [with no formal training, became positioned as an
"expert" on AI ethics, a field that barely existed before 2017. But it
is even stranger that two years later, respected scholars in established
disciplines have to demonstrate their relevance to a field conjured by a
corporate lobby.]{.underline} UNITED STATES - APRIL 17: Eric Schmidt,

has also become relevant to the U.S. military, not only in official
responses to moral concerns about technologies of targeted killing but
also in disputes among Silicon Valley firms over lucrative military
contracts. On November 1, the Department of Defense's innovation board
published its recommendations for "AI Ethics Principles." The board is
chaired by Eric Schmidt, who was the executive chair of Alphabet,
Google's parent company, when Obama's defense secretary Ashton B. Carter
established the board and appointed him in 2016. According to
ProPublica, "Schmidt's influence, already strong under Carter, only grew
when \[James\] Mattis arrived as \[Trump's\] defense secretary." The
board includes multiple executives from Google, Microsoft, and Facebook,
raising controversies regarding conflicts of interest. A Pentagon
employee responsible for policing conflicts of interest was removed from
the innovation board after she challenged "the Pentagon's cozy
relationship not only with \[Amazon CEO Jeff\] Bezos, but with Google's
Eric Schmidt." This relationship is potentially lucrative for big tech
firms: The AI ethics recommendations appeared less than a week after the
Pentagon awarded a \$10 billion cloud-computing contract to Microsoft,
which is being legally challenged by Amazon[. The [majority of
well-funded work on "ethical AI"]{.mark} is [aligned with]{.mark} the
**[tech]{.mark}** lobby's agenda: to voluntarily or moderately adjust,
rather than legally restrict, the deployment of controversial
technologies. The recommendations seek to compel the Pentagon to
increase military investments in AI and to adopt "ethical AI" systems
such as those developed and sold by Silicon Valley firms.]{.underline}
The innovation board calls the Pentagon a "deeply ethical organization"
and offers to extend its "existing ethics framework" to AI. To this end,
the board cites the AI ethics research groups at Google, Microsoft, and
IBM, as well as academics sponsored by the MIT-Harvard fund. However,
there are caveats. For example, the board notes that although "the term
'fairness' is often cited in the AI community," the recommendations
avoid this term because of "the DoD mantra that fights should not be
fair, as DoD aims to create the conditions to maintain an unfair
advantage over any potential adversaries." Thus, "some applications will
be permissibly and justifiably biased," specifically "to target certain
adversarial combatants more successfully[." The **[Pentagon's conception
of AI ethics forecloses many important possibilities for moral
deliberation]{.mark}**, such as the prohibition of drones for targeted
killing. The corporate, academic, and military proponents of "ethical
AI" have collaborated closely for mutual benefit]{.underline}. For
example, Ito told me that he informally advised Schmidt on which
academic AI ethicists Schmidt's private foundation should fund. Once,
Ito even asked me for second-order advice on whether Schmidt should fund
a certain professor who, like Ito, later served as an "expert
consultant" to the Pentagon's innovation board. In February, Ito joined
Carter at a panel titled "Computing for the People: Ethics and AI,"
which also included current and former executives of Microsoft and
Google. The panel was part of the inaugural celebration of MIT's \$1
billion college dedicated to AI. Other speakers at the celebration
included Schmidt on "Computing for the Marketplace," Siegel on "How I
Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Algorithms," and Henry Kissinger on
"How the Enlightenment Ends." As Kissinger declared the possibility of
"a world relying on machines powered by data and algorithms and
ungoverned by ethical or philosophical norms," a protest outside the MIT
auditorium called attention to Kissinger's war crimes in Vietnam,
Cambodia, and Laos, as well as his support of war crimes elsewhere. In
the age of automated targeting, what atrocities will the U.S. military
justify as governed by "ethical" norms or as executed by machines beyond
the scope of human agency and culpability? No defensible claim to
"ethics" can sidestep the urgency of legally enforceable restrictions to
the deployment of technologies of mass surveillance and systemic
violence[. Until such restrictions exist, moral and political
[deliberation about computing will]{.mark} remain subsidiary to the
profit-making imperative expressed by the Media Lab's motto, **["Deploy
or Die."]{.mark}** While some deploy, even if ostensibly "ethically,"
others die.]{.underline}

The 'wounded attachments' of political whiteness In her 1995 book States
of Injury, Wendy Brown argued that [progressive movements tended to
coalesce around ['wounded identities']{.mark} that **[demanded
recognition]{.mark}** and protection, whether from hate speech,
harassment or violence.]{.underline} For Brown (1995: 55), [[such
politics]{.mark} not only reified said identities but ontologised
trauma, [producing a 'politics of recrimination and rancor']{.mark} with
**[deep investments in victimisation]{.mark}** and suffering.
Second-wave feminism in particular, Brown argued, had instantiated
'woman' as an identity based on injury]{.underline}. She interpreted
feminist consciousness-raising and the 'speak out' as akin to Foucault's
(1978) 'modern confessional' in their production of accounts that could
be appropriated by punitive (and therapeutic) state governmentalities.
Solidifying the 'truth' of women's experience through 'speaking out',
she contended, was not necessarily liberation (Brown 1995: 42). As I
have argued elsewhere (Phipps, 2019), [the 'wounded attachments' Brown
attributed to feminism are likely to be those of middle-class
[white]{.mark}ness, given the domination of both first and second waves
of mainstream feminism by bourgeois white women (such as myself) (Ware,
1992: 18). By ['mainstream feminism']{.mark}, I largely mean
Anglo-American public feminism. This includes [media feminism
(]{.mark}and some forms of social media feminism), [institutional
feminism, corporate feminism]{.mark} and **[policy
feminism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is [[not a cohesive]{.mark} and
unified [movement, but]{.mark} it **[has clear directions and
effects]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Building on HoSang (2010[), I call the
modus operandi of this feminism '**[political whiteness']{.mark}**. This
[goes beyond]{.mark} the [implicitly]{.mark} or explicitly ['whites
first' orientation of]{.mark} most [politics dominated by white
people]{.mark}: it has a **[complex affective landscape]{.mark}**
involving attachments to the self]{.underline} (often the wounded self)
and to power (often in the form of the state). These attachments produce
a number of dynamics: narcissism, alertness to threat (which in white
women's case is often sexualised), and an accompanying need for control.
Political whiteness characterises both mainstream feminism and the
backlash against it, as they 'battle it out' (Banet-Weiser, 2018: 1) on
the contemporary cultural stage. [[Victimhood]{.mark} is **[central to
these battles]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Banet-Weiser, 2018: 4). Women's
sexual victimisation has been at the forefront of recent mainstream
feminist campaigns, exemplified by actions such as the Women's March as
well as the viral iteration of #MeToo. Responding to this, the backlash
has been preoccupied with who the real victims are. One of its central
claims is that 'feminism has gone too far' (Nicholas and Aguis, 2017:
31), and that men are now fearful because harmless touching has been
defined as abuse. These narratives are bolstered by broader stories of
white victimhood which have underpinned Brexit, the election of Trump,
and the elevation of other far-right figures and parties worldwide
(Corredor, 2019). Crying 'white-lady tears' On International Men's Day
2019, Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan broadcast a monologue
comparing middle-class white men to endangered rhinos. 'Yes, we do need
a day', he said. 'We are now the most downtrodden group of men in the
world'. Assertions such as this, from the heart of the backlash, have
been given short shrift by white feminists who often use the idiom of
'male tears'. In 2014, writer Jessica Valenti tweeted a picture of
herself wearing a T-shirt with the slogan: I BATHE IN MALE TEARS
(Phipps, 2020: 69). However, [white feminists have been slower to
acknowledge our own tendency to be lachrymose, which is often an
[attempt to **avoid** accountability]{.mark} in response to criticism by
women of colour. Historically, bourgeois white women's power has been
based on ideas of virtue and goodness (]{.underline}Ware, 1992: 37--38):
as Hamad (2019: 105) argues, [this makes being criticised for bad
behaviour deeply threatening. White women can also be so invested in our
oppression as women that we resist addressing our privilege as
white]{.underline} (Accapadi, 2007: 208). Robin di Angelo (2011: 57)
argues that [white people in general exist in a **[state of
fragility]{.mark}** 'in which [even a **minimum amount** of racial
stress becomes intolerable,]{.mark} triggering defensive
moves'.]{.underline} di Angelo has been critiqued for her individualised
focus on selfimprovement rather than structural change (Jackson, 2019).
[However, an [understanding of whiteness as]{.mark} the **[performance
of structural supremacy]{.mark}** still involves fragility, [whether
this is the]{.mark} angry [brittleness of hegemonic]{.mark} white
masculinity [or the 'delicacy' of white bourgeois **femininity (the
source of its power).**]{.mark} If [anger is the main expression]{.mark}
of white power in a [masculine]{.mark} register, **[tears are its
feminine]{.mark}** equivalent. 'Tear', as a both a noun and a verb, has
multiple meanings: bourgeois white womanhood both tears (in the sense of
becoming torn or damaged), and consequently tears (in the sense of
tearing up), easily. This 'damsel in distress' evokes a protective
response: and simultaneously, colonial archetypes of people of colour as
aggressive and frightening come into play. This is the pretext on which
white men, enraged, tear the place apart.]{.underline} Hamad (2019: 105)
terms this Strategic White Womanhood, a historical dynamic which endures
in the contemporary, in various forms. She recounts a relevant incident
in 2018 involving Cambridge professors Mary Beard and Priyamvada Gopal.
Beard was challenged by Gopal and others over a tweet she had posted on
allegations of sexual abuse by Oxfam staff in Haiti and elsewhere. 'I do
wonder how hard it must be to sustain civilised values in a war zone',
it said. In response to criticism, Beard tweeted a picture of herself
crying; afterwards, Gopal in particular was the target of racist attacks
(Hamad 2019: 102--105). For Hamad (2019: 25, 229), this exemplifies the
abusive relationship women of colour have with white womanhood. [When
the going gets tough, she argues, white women 'turn their sanctioned
victim status' on women of colour. While privileged white women bathe in
male tears, women of colour can drown in ours. Our sanctioned victim
status shields privileged white women from accountability in
interpersonal interactions and in the political sphere.]{.underline} In
her discussion of the 2017 Women's March, Brittney Cooper (2018: 182)
highlighted exit polls that found 53 percent of white women voted for
Trump, compared to 94 percent of Black women who voted for Clinton
(despite their reservations). Watching white women protest Trump's
election, she wrote, when we were partly responsible for it, felt like
'an exercise in whitelady tears if I ever saw one'. Read in a structural
way, the Women's March could be seen as an action that hid white women's
complicity in Trump's success (Phipps, 2020: 120) -- in Hamad's terms,
Strategic White Womanhood writ large. Phipps 85 In May 2019, Theresa May
wept outside 10 Downing Street as she resigned the UK premiership.
[These **[tears did political work,]{.mark}**]{.underline} creating
amnesia in some quarters over May's record as Prime Minister, and
previously as Home Secretary. Perhaps most strikingly, domestic abuse
charity Women's Aid posted a (subsequently deleted) tweet thanking May
for her service to women and survivors. [This prompted a critical
response: prior to her resignation, May had failed to guarantee that
women's refuges would not close as part of an overhaul of supported
housing. In 2015, she had been accused of allowing 'state-sanctioned'
rape and abuse of vulnerable migrant women at the Yarl's Wood detention
centre.]{.underline} Her government presided over the rollout of
Universal Credit, the punitive benefits system that has made it more
difficult for women to leave abusive relationships. It appeared that,
for some, May's tears washed these acts out of the picture (Phipps,
2020: 70). haunting photo. Whatever you think about Theresa May\'s
record as prime minister, it\'s impossible not to feel sorry for her as
a person'.3 This attempt to separate the personal and political is
central to white women's tears as a strategic device. We demand to be
treated as 'just a person' who should be granted the benefit of the
doubt, who exists outside racialised structures and power relations even
as our actions perpetuate them. [However, while privileged **[white
feminists deny]{.mark}** the **[relationship between]{.mark}** the
**[personal and]{.mark}** the **[political in response]{.mark}** to
critique, in our own theory and politics this relationship (and in
particular, our own personal experience or that of women like us) takes
centre stage. This is more than just hypocrisy; it is white supremacy.
Whether we deny or emphasise the relationship between the personal and
political, white women's tears enable us to centre ourselves and
marginalise women of colour]{.underline}. In an article on #MeToo,
Jamilah Lemieux (2017) commented, 'white women know how to be victims.
[**[They know just how to bleed]{.mark}** **[and weep]{.mark}** in the
public square, they fundamentally understand that they are entitled to
sympathy'.]{.underline} Lemieux was not claiming the disclosures of
#MeToo were not genuine; she was highlighting the power brought to
mainstream feminism by the power of white women's tears. White-lady
tears, to use Cooper's phrase: bourgeois white women's tears are the
ultimate symbol of femininity, evoking the damsel in distress and the
mourning, lamenting women of myth (Phipps, 2020: 71). It is likely that
this power is not fully accessible to working-class white women, who are
often figures of classed disgust (Tyler, 2008). While it might date back
to the ancients[, the power of bourgeois white women's tears was
solidified in the modern colonial period, as 'women's protection' became
key to the deadly disciplinary power that maintained racialised and
classed regimes of extraction and exploitation. White tears, white rage,
white personhood White supremacy produces both white tears and white
rage, and colonialism relied on a circuit between bourgeois white
women's tears and white men's punitive power]{.underline}. This was
often activated by the vocabulary of rape: Indigenous, colonised and
enslaved men were maimed and killed after allegations made by bourgeois
white women (Ware, 1992: 11, 37). As Angela Davis (1981: 106--111)
argues, [both mass rape of Black women and allegations of rape against
Black men have been instruments of white supremacy (]{.underline}Davis,
1981: 106--111[). In earlier phases of capitalism, rape laws functioned
to protect upperclass men, whose wives or daughters (their property)
might be violated (Davis, 1981: 101). In the genocidally violent
relations of theft, capture and chattel that characterised colonial
capitalism, rape prohibitions took on similar meanings at the levels of
community, nation and race.]{.underline} In colonial Australia, rape was
a 'violation of female purity' punishable by death: politicians insisted
this was necessary to keep Aboriginal and 'disreputable' (poor) white
men under control (Kaladelfos, 2012: 159). The vulnerable bourgeois
white woman was central to accounts of insurrections such as the Indian
Mutiny and the Morant Bay uprising in Jamaica (Ware, 1992: 39--42): fear
of rape was fear of revolution. In the United States, following the
Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, white Americans used lynching to
terrorise and control Black people. Rape of a white woman was one of the
most common pretexts for attacks on growing Black social and economic
power (Ware, 1992: 179--182). In 1921, white mobs (many of them
deputised and/or given weapons by city officials) killed between 100 and
300 Black people and destroyed 1000 houses in Greenwood, Tulsa, after a
Black man was falsely accused of assaulting a white female elevator
operator. Greenwood Avenue had been known as 'Black Wall Street' because
it was one of the most affluent African-American communities of the
early 20th century (Madigan, 2001). The story of Emmett Till is perhaps
the best-known of this history of what Sharpe (2016: 15) calls the
'ongoingness of the conditions of capture'. A 14-year-old Till was
brutalised and killed by two white men in Mississippi in 1955, after
Carolyn Bryant falsely accused him of 'uttering obscenities' and
grabbing her by the waist. Jessie Daniels (2018) has called Bryant 'the
foremother of contemporary white women who call the police on Black
people sitting in a Starbucks, barbecuing in a park or napping in a
dorm', acts that have also led to fatal violence (Sharpe, 2016: 52).
[The 2020 Black Lives Matter protests following the police murder of
George Floyd reiterated that Black lives are still the price of white
affective security]{.underline} (see Schuller, 2018: 2), and [[Black
death]{.mark} is [still crucial to]{.mark} the [operation of the white
supremacist state]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Sharpe, 2016: 9). White
women's 'safety' is also central to contemporary border regimes, which
purport to protect us from immigrants and traffickers but actually
create the conditions for mass exploitation and abuse (Mac and Smith,
2018: 59--60, 75--76). [Political whiteness involves a will to power: in
the case of bourgeois white women, this was and is often achieved
through performances of powerlessness. We exist at the intersections of
capitalism, white supremacy and heteropatriarchy, with little control
over the means of production]{.underline} (Lugones, 2008: 15) but with
raced and classed dominance that requires feminine submission. Like
Penelope in Homer's Odyssey, we fling ourselves on the floor and cry.
This activates the settler's and master's revenge, now embodied in the
necropolitical (Mbembe, 2003) criminal punishment and border control
that captures Black and brown people and/or leaves them to perish: what
Sharpe (2016: 16) terms [the 'reappearance of the slave ship in everyday
life'. This circuit between white tears and white rage means that the
relationship between the personal and political in white feminism has
always been corruptible or perhaps even inherently corrupt. In contrast
to the damsel in distress, the woman of colour has had her innocence
stripped by colonialism,]{.underline} often through rape (Hamad, 2019:
18--19). As Angela Davis Phipps 87 (1981) argues, colonial ideas about
Black sexual 'savagery' created both the notions of the Black man as
rapist and the Black woman as un-rapeable, encased in the notion of
Black people's bodies as objects to which anything could be done
(Sharpe, 2016: 13). During #MeToo, the only allegations Harvey Weinstein
publicly refuted were from actors Salma Hayek and Lupita Nyong'o: Hamad
(2018: 55) argues that this was because brown and Black women are easier
to discredit. Women of colour, and particularly [Black women, are not
able to politicise their pain in the way white women do: this both
reflects and perpetuates their thingification]{.underline} (Césaire,
1950: 42) and 'abjection from the realm of the human' (Sharpe, 2016:
12).4 [It is not just that the tears of white women are valued while
those of Black women are dismissed. It is that race itself (and perhaps
class, at least to a certain extent) is defined by the perceived
capacity to cry, that the performance of bourgeois white emotion
accomplishes the dehumanisation of people of colour.]{.underline} As
Kyla Schuller (2018) has shown, in 19th-century sex and race 'science',
ideas about sex difference (seen as a property of bourgeois whiteness)
intermingled with ideas about feeling. This divided the 'civilised' body
into two halves: 'the sentimental woman . . . and the less susceptible
and more rational man' (Schuller 2018: 16[). The bourgeois white woman's
capacity to cry was fundamental to her dominant status, as was the
capacity of her male counterpart to respond to her tears with action.
[Humanness came to refer to both an assumed capacity for feeling]{.mark}
and **[the capacity to control it.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Samuel A. Chambers defines the imagination as a "synthetic power of
creation and re-creation---an ability to combine the uncombinable, to
surpass binaries without merely collapsing them, to fashion something
new" (620). **[And from such synthesis, we are told that a democratic
imagination is possible, since we would "think the limits (and their
transgression) of democratic theory and of democracy as
well]{.underline}**" (620). Here, we see that the **[democratic
imagination recasts limits as possibilities rather than complete
failures. Limits become the resource for creation and re-creation rather
than evidence of destruction and uselessness]{.underline}**. A couture
Kantianism / Hegelianism (mixed with a splash of deconstruction)
**[salvages democracy from the perils of its absurdity, devastation, and
brutality]{.underline}**. **[Why]{.underline}** this **[investment in
democracy's "intrinsic" creative power]{.underline}**? **[Can this
creativity finally bring an end to anti-Black violence and Black
suffering]{.underline}**? Or is the knowledge of democracy's
fabulousness enough to sustain Blacks through police terrorism,
environmental racism, re-enslavement through incarceration, and food /
housing insecurity and discrimination? I would suggest that what makes
such creative synthesis possible is an unacknowledged dependence on
time. For proponents of democracy**[, it is time that is malleable for
creative enterprises of re-imagination, of progress fetishization, and
an "ontology of change" that need not justify (or prove) itself,
declaration of change seems to be enough]{.underline}** (Badiou,
"Ontology"). What if, however, democracy is clinging to a depleted
resource**[? What if time is no longer enough to orient existence,
especially for those inhabitants of an abyss---within which time, space,
ethics, and law are weaponized against existence? Put somewhat
differently, democracy has exhausted the imagination]{.underline}**. It
is a **[speculative vampire that drains the imagination of any vital
resource for its own survival. This speculation is an outrageous
expenditure of energy, an enjoyment without end, a scholarly
surplus-pleasure requiring an incessant (and useless) political
repetition]{.underline}** (Johnston). I would describe this
speculation---the conjoining of time, democracy, and the
imagination---as an interminable quest, or a certain "stuckness" in a
scene of failure (a constant encircling of political and legal vacuity).
This repetition is most dramatically demonstrated, for me, in **[Black
political participation---voting, protesting, keeping hope alive,
returning to the kernel of authoritarian violence (i. e.,
anti-Blackness) with unbridled hope, temporal determination, and an
investment in the ontology of change]{.underline}** (Warren; Farred).

matters!" "we have power!" "we're moving forward," etc., serve to
**[neglect the failure of Black political participation and to imprison
the imagination within futurity]{.underline}**. As I am writing these
remarks, I am witnessing the absurdity of this democratic imagination
and its unrelenting time. On one news program, I hear that police shot
unarmed Andre Hill, a forty-seven-yearold Black resident of Columbus,
Ohio, without cause, and rather than offering him medical assistance,
decided to handcuff him (just in case the supine, dying man finds a gun,
magically, I guess). On the other news program, I hear Black politicians
importuning, begging, and guilting Blacks into voting for change. Black
political pundits assure voters that the ontology of change is
realizable if you just exercise your right to vote. "Never again!" "We
will transform police practices!" "This time will be different!" Did
Blacks not vote when police shot twelve-year-old Tamir Rice as he was
playing with his toy gun on the playground? (By the way, no federal
charges will be brought against the police officers who shot him). Did
Blacks not vote when Sandra Bland lost her life in police custody? Did
Blacks not vote after police deprived Eric Garner and George Floyd (and
apparently 70 other people) of breath (Baker et al.)? In answer to my
inquiry "why should we continue to vote if anti-Black violence is not
changing?" I am told, "Just keep believing, we can vote people in that
can change things!" When I then ask, "But I voted for President Obama
(suspending my nihilism in an intoxication of hopeaffect), I thought
things were going to change for Blacks? I feel just as unsafe and
endangered post-Obama as pre-Obama," I am told, "Obama wasn't a 'magic
Negro.' He did the best he could." Then I ask, "So why vote if it will
take an act of magic to address the existential threat of
anti-Blackness?" **[Time mocks the cyclical movement of such inquiries,
they are, indeed, unanswerable within the creative, synthetic, and
powerful democratic horizon]{.underline}**. Voting **[becomes the
premier instrument of the democratic imagination---supposedly, it
activates the imagination with futurity, avoids paralysis with action,
and can be repeated. What type of creativity will finally eradicate
anti-Black brutality]{.underline}**? And could such creativity even
operate within time**[? Could we still call such creativity democracy?
Must we abandon time to enable the imagination to perform the mystical,
the magical, and the ineffable?]{.underline}**

### A2 NATO Good

#### Nato racializes representations

**Murray 20** (A*nti-imperial world politics: race, class, and
internationalism in the making of post-colonial orde*rs \" Christopher
Patrick ,PhD thesis, London School of Economics and Political Science)

The **[[discourses of Africans and people of African
descent]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which ultimately helped bring about the
end of formal empire in Africa and the Caribbean, took place during a
particularly important moment in the formation of 'the international.'
62 While the first and second waves of decolonisation comprised similar
dynamics of empire-colony relations, and the internal divergences within
colonised societies, the third wave of decolonisation came as the result
of a uniquely global discourse around the role of imperialism in the
First World War, **[the [threat this represented to 'world
civilisation']{.mark}, and the new forms of international governance and
social relations needed to address global conflict. During this moment,
empire came to be seen as in need of reform by some, and inherently
destructive and regressive by others]{.underline}**. In each case, the
emergence of more powerful and organised racial advocacy networks and
the **[[depreciating returns of white imperial legitimacy galvanised
arguments for non-white inclusion in governance]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[Objection to white supremacy proliferated in various transnational
advocacy organizations and through colonial and metropolitan print
cultures]{.underline}**. These ideas were facilitated by the
synchronisation of racial grievance throughout colonised populations,
but also by the ideological and organisational resources supplied by the
COMINTERN and the United States. Black anti-imperialism is not reducible
to Soviet communism or American liberalism, but its entanglements with
other political movements often led to important consequences, such as
the crackdown on its print materials and organising by colonial
authorities.63 **[The focus on [black internationalism]{.mark} also [has
a rationale]{.mark} [related]{.mark} to the relative [neglect of certain
discourses and ideologies]{.mark} in the [formation of the
international/states system]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While it would be
possible to dig deeper into the **[anti[-imperial politics of white
metropolitan activists]{.mark}, the view that [independence was gifted
to the colonies]{.mark} by benevolent whites does not need further
elaboration.]{.underline}** The notion that white **[[Western
societies]{.mark} came around on their own to new moral [positions
on]{.mark} practices like colonialism already forms the bedrock for a
[plethora of liberal constructivist studie]{.mark}s]{.underline}** and
popular histories.64 Analysis of the world political discourse of
[individuals]{.mark} like Marcus Garvey, Cyril Briggs, J.E. and Adelaide
Casely Hayford, Paulette Nardal, George Padmore, among others, forms
part of the unique contribution of this study. Although they usually
referred to peasant and worker communities, the discourses I analyse
here were relatively elite. However, **[there is more in the history of
anti-imperial, intra-elite discourse than has been sometimes suggested
by historians of the subaltern. Excluded socially and
politically]{.underline}**, but rich in cultural capital, sufficiently
resourced to travel between colony and metropole, and tailored towards
low level, white collar professions, many anti-imperial writers and
leaders were acutely aware of the transnational pecking order, and
occupied a position of relative subalternity. For the most part, these
individuals fit Edward Said's category of the 'secular intellectual.'65
Said defines secular intellectuals by six axes of activity and thought:
1.) the 'archival function' of preserving and deploying
'counterinformation' which is hidden by the 'prevailing consensus'; 2.)
translating specialized knowledge and literature into forms accessible
to broad groups of people; 3.) demystifying the language of authority
which appeals to so-called pragmatic common-sense in order to highlight
the underlying ethical or political implications; 4.) disrupting
attempts to privatize knowledge by challenging the boundaries of
specialized domains of practice; 5.) resisting a culture's slide into
total domination or trivialization; and 6.) insisting on the
irreconcilability and irreducibility of oppositions.66 In Antonio
Gramsci's problematic and the European context, such figures would
normally be considered intellectuals proper, the 'organizers of culture'
contrasted with the 'organic intellectuals' who derive their ideology
from the 'essential task of economic production.'67 But the relative
marginality of colonial anti-imperial activists created a unique
position where the function of intellectual critique often needed to be
exercised outside the realms of formal knowledge production---in the
function rooms and public parks of metropolitan centres, through art and
literature, and in transnational print media **[Through its empirics and
approach this study seeks to contribute to the '([re)turn' to empire and
race in IR]{.mark}]{.underline}**.69 A few scholars now recognise that
analysis of contemporary international relations, whether it concerns
Brexit; **[[Russian, Chinese, and Western rivalry in Africa]{.mark};
[NATO operations in the Middle Eas]{.mark}]{.underline}**[t]{.mark};
Salafist movements; **[transnational protest movements like Black Lives
Matter]{.underline}**; or developments in organisations like CARICOM,
the African Union, or ASEAN, **[is often poorer for [not attending to
legacies of empire and colonialism,]{.mark} as well as [ongoing imperial
relations]{.mark}. Critical histories of IR have pointed to IR as an
academic discipline which got its [start through the policy science of
race development and imperial managemen]{.mark}t]{.underline}**70; which
continues to advance self-flattering myths about Western exceptionalism;
and which claims or assumes the universality of European history,
institutions, and technologies. This can have the effect of whitewashing
Euro-American world politics, or, more insidiously, continuing to
normalise state-sanctioned violence and inequality. **[71 These
[critiques of IR as a Eurocentric discipline]{.mark}, historically
[bound up with white supremacy]{.mark}, have [carried the discipline to
a crossroads]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Down one road, **[there is the
[possibility of]{.mark} attempting to address these o[missions and
biases with analysis based in liberal pluralist inclusion:]{.mark}
adding a host of 'non-Western' categories and biases, which posit
cultural and territorialised particularities]{.underline}**. **[I argue
that the likely outcome here is not an amelioration of Eurocentrism, but
an extension of it. The West is still granted the terrain of the
universal, with 'the non-West' granted tolerance to tack on a variety of
cultural 'differences']{.underline}**, as long as it largely continues
to adhere to disciplinary shibboleths, such as order, sovereignty, and
recognition. **[Another path -- though not the only one \-- is the
[relational-historical approach to empire and race]{.mark} I put forward
in this study. This understands [relations between former empires and
colonies as asymmetrical and differentiated]{.mark} but connected,
constituted through resistance and alliance as well as
oppression]{.underline}**, and interpretable through discourse, which
often concerned bounded communities, but was usually also
boundary-crossing.

[Predictive [analytics]{.mark} use a variety of techniques (e.g.,
statistical methods, machine learning algorithms[) **to make predictions
about future events**.]{.mark} Although predictive analytics have been
used in many disciplines since the early 20th century (e.g., actuarial
science, business intelligence, financial forecasting), increasingly,
this computationally intensive technique has been [employed]{.mark} [by
law enforcemen]{.mark}t and other [gov]{.mark}ernment agencies
[to]{.mark} [generate predictions]{.mark} [about]{.mark} future
[criminal]{.mark} [behavior]{.mark}.]{.underline} While the function of
predictive analytics in policing [appears]{.underline} to be [well
intentioned]{.underline}, upon a closer examination, one may find that
the decisions generated by 'black\--box' modeling techniques like
supervised machine learning [encourage a 'blind faith']{.underline} in
the mathematical process and [in]{.underline} the [ability]{.underline}
of algorithms [to produce]{.underline} meaningful and informative
[predictions]{.underline}. Thus, despite their widespread use,
predictive policing tools are complex systems with many aspects that
remain a mystery. In this paper, we critically [examine the employment
of predictive analytics in US criminal justice policy]{.underline}, with
a particular focus on the ways in which these [[technological practices
are reproducin]{.mark}g and reinforcing [structural relations of
differenc]{.mark}]{.underline}[e]{.mark}. We are specifically motivated
by the following questions: In what ways do the algorithms become part
of a larger sociotechnical apparatus of sociopolitical relations? [How
are the data that the algorithms inherit alwaysalready imbued with
structural relations of difference? To what extent do algorithms predict
or performatively enact differential patterns of sentencing decisions or
recidivism? In what ways might bodies, spaces, and practices be
materially formed and shaped from the performative acts of algorithmic
legal reasoning?]{.underline} And, in what ways might the [**[cloaking
of algorithmic legal reasoning as objective, precise, and efficient
enable the proliferation of racializing assemblages in the juridical
field]{.mark}**?]{.underline} Each of these motivating questions will be
examined through a new materialist lens that [posits [algorithms as
more\--thanhuman ontologies and racializing
assemblages.]{.mark}]{.underline} As argued by the first author
elsewhere, we need to move beyond the dominant tendency to treat
algorithms as mechanical operations that are contingent on human
intervention or design and, as such, a prosthetic tool to human
cognition. The concept of algo\--ritmo reconceptualizes the algorithm as
1 2 3 4 D\-- 3/41 engaging in more\--than\--human performative acts that
are produced from the immanent forms of what Luciana Parisi refers to as
the "soft" thought of algorithmic reasoning. As a concept, [algo\--ritmo
not only accounts theoretically for how the more\--than\--human
performative acts of [algorithms]{.mark} [function]{.mark} but also
considers the ways [in]{.mark} which those algorithmic acts are
[forming, shaping, hierarchizing, and differentiating
bodies]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, [algo\--ritmo also refers to the ways
in which [algorithms]{.mark} [become]{.mark} [racializing
assemblages]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} As articulated by Alex Weheliye,
racializing assemblages are a system of sociopolitical relations that
hierarchizes and differentiates bodies, designating bodies as human,
notquite\--human, and nonhuman; rendering certain bodies as exceptional
and others as disposable. Algo\--ritmo postulates that the bodily
disciplining is both human and more\--than\--hum an. Thus, there are not
just human bodies that are racialized but algorithms too. In other
words, we argue that inside of the proverbial "black [box" , algorithms
become immanent agencies of racializing assemblages.]{.underline} By

2012, the Obama Administration unveiled a Big Data Initiative, which
sought to "improve the tools and techniques needed to access, organize,
and glean discoveries from huge volumes of digital data." Arguably,
where there have been even [more advancements]{.underline} on these
fronts has been [in local city governance and institutional
practices.]{.underline} While many government institutions have turned
to big data [analytics]{.underline} [to make more "intelligent"

which these techniques have been developed and applied.]{.underline} 5 6
7 8 9 10 D\-- 4/41 Policing Bodies Numerically Before delving into the
use of analytics in policing, it is important to understand the history
of the use of statistics and numbers more broadly in criminal justice
research. [[Prediction and forecasting]{.underline} ha]{.mark}ve been
used for nearly a century to study crime in the U.S. While much of this
research has been focused on studying criminal behavior , other work has
[used forecasting methods to predict trends in crime and prison
populations]{.underline}. That said, no matter the outcome, criminal
justice researchers have long been obsessed with using data ---and in
particular quantitative data---to understand crime. One prevailing
belief is that, culturally speaking, the predominance of quantitative
methods in criminal justice research reflects a broader societal notion
about what it means to do science, and in this context it should not be
surprising that to do science requires the manipulation and calculation
of numbers. [The act of defining [and]{.mark} [explaining social
phenomena using numbers or quantitative data]{.mark} is nothing
new]{.underline}. In fact, this phenomenon has its roots in positivism.
Positivism refers to the philosophical writings (circa 1830\--1842) of
Auguste Comte in which the scientific method---the standard procedure
for gaining and producing knowledge in the natural sciences---was
applied to the study of human behavior and social phenomena. According
to Comte, there are three premises of positivism: 1. Universal truths
exist for human behavior and social phenomena. 2. Empirical observation
is the only rational means by which universal truths in the social world
can be discovered. 3. [Through the application of the scientific method,
causal relationships among social phenomena can be
established]{.underline} Imbued within positivist philosophy is the
notion that truth cannot only be discovered but also replicated through
(precise and certain) scientific measurement. It was through the
application of positivism to the study of the human condition and social
life that quantification and the scientific method become central
features of social and behavioral science and the preferred ways of
understanding populations. While the rise of positivism led to the
growing use of quantitative methods in the human sciences, why were
these methods so readily and widely accepted? 11 12 13 14 15 D\-- 5/41
Theodore Porter in his seminal work Trust in Numbers historically traces
the rise of objective empiricism and ubiquity of quantification in the
modern world. To Porter, and largely society as a whole, we are drawn to
numbers not only because they can be used to describe social phenomena,
but also because a decision 'made' by numbers appears impartial and
indisputable. [This notion of numbers as 'truth' [is rooted in]{.mark}
the belief that mathematics is the language and logic of the natural
world. When applied to the study of human and social life, however, in
what ways and to what extent do numbers become political and reflect the
normative assumptions about what is counted, how it is counted, and why
it is counted]{.underline}? This critical question is at the heart of
Porter's work, and through the use of historical case studies he
demonstrates that numbers are never void of subjectivity or judgment.
[Rather]{.underline}, [numbers]{.underline} are ["strategies of
communication" that are used to [legitimize one's actions]{.mark} and
"provide standards against which \[to measure progress and compare
information\]." In this way, numbers become "[an agency for acting on
people \[and\] exercising power over them]{.mark}]{.underline}." If we
build off Porter's claim about the nature of numbers and take seriously
the proposition that numbers are capable of exerting power, then we must
consider the possibility that [[numbers, which can describe the social
world, can just as easily be used to control it]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Michel Foucault takes up this subject in many of his works, and
characterizes discipline as a mode of power that "[[separates, analyses,
differentiates...measures...and hierarchizes in terms of
value]{.mark}."]{.underline} Importantly, for Foucault, while discipline
is "exercised on the bodies of individuals...the individual is not the
primary datum on which discipline is exercised." Although this statement
may seem paradoxical, it can be explained by examining Foucault's two
lecture series Security, Territory, and Population and Governmentality.
In both works, Foucault provides a historical account of the evolution
of government, and describes how society's transition from feudalism to
capitalism led government to be concerned with the population within its
territory in order to successfully govern the territory over which it
has control. Driving this concern was the desire to organize, optimize,
and regulate state affairs. This, of course, required the collection of
data from individuals, while privileging quantified population trends.
Viewed through a Foucauldian lens, then, [methods of quantification such
as statistics are a means through which the state controls, categorizes,
and classifies its citizens.]{.underline} [The Rise of the Carceral
State]{.underline} 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 D\-- 6/41 If statistics and
numbers have had historical significance in criminal justice research,
then we must inquire about the role they have played in policing bodies
in the U.S. In particular, we ask how have [[numbers shaped policing and
legitimized mass incarceration]{.underline}]{.mark}? We contend that the
origins of mass incarceration in the U.S. can be traced to the Johnson
era's War on Poverty. When Lyndon B. Johnson assumed the presidency, he
not only vowed to enforce civil rights, but he also declared war on
poverty. After a few years in office, however, what began as a
commitment to nationwide anti\--poverty programs quickly turned into
something more sinister---namely, an agenda to target and punish urban,
black communities across America. In 1965, Daniel Moynihan, a politician
and sociologist, released a report titled The Negro Family: The Case for
National Action. In the report, Moynihan used employment data to
identify the causes of poverty and social\--ill (e.g., crime,
corruption) in the U.S. Often citing dire statistics to shock the reader
(e.g. "Almost One\--Fourth of Negro Families are Headed by Females"),
Moynihan's report largely painted the poverty problem in the U.S. as a
"negro problem" rooted in the disintegration of the black nuclear
family. Though President Johnson would come to distance himself from the
blatantly racist report authored by Moynihan, by the end of his term in
office, the damage had already been done. The carefully crafted
communication strategy embedded within Moynihan's report had
[legitimized the government's desire to control the "negro
problem]{.underline}," and culminated in the Omnibus Crime Control and
Safe Streets Act of 1968. Crime & Carceral State The Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 signaled a profound shift in the
government's attitude and response to the root causes and correlates of
crime. The Act enabled the federal government to provide financial
assistance to local law enforcement agencies for the procurement of
police equipment and laid the foundation for massive federal investments
in crime control and prevention strategies. More importantly, however,
the Act expanded the federal government's (e.g., Department of Justice)
role in local law enforcement and criminal justice matters, with the
goal of creating an interconnected, coordinated system for the provision
of justice and crime 24 25 26 27 28 D\-- 7/41 prevention. Ultimately,
the Crime Control and Safe Streets Act represented a major step by the
government to federalize crime and codified the prioritization of law
enforcement over welfare as a means to address social problems. Less
than a decade after President Johnson signed the Omnibus Crime Control
and Safe Streets Act into Law, and after decades of stability in the
rates of incarceration, the U.S. began to experience substantial growth
in its prison population, a trend that has yet to be reversed. By the
late 1960s, fear of rising urban crime and drug related activities,
coupled with social and political unrest, fueled bilateral support for
the United States' punitive approach to law and order. This support
translated into harsher punishments for minor offenses and mandatory
minimum sentences and, ultimately, resulted in extraordinarily high
rates of incarceration after 1970. According to estimates published by
the Bureau of Justice Statistics, approximately 500,000 people were
incarcerated in 1980. By 2000, however, the total incarcerated
population had exploded to more than 1.9 million. Though the shift
towards tougher penal policies exerted a significant influence on
national incarceration rates, time trends show that growth in
incarceration in the U.S. has not been uniform across offenses or
offenders. It is commonly recognized that the War on Drugs has
contributed to the rise in incarceration rates over the last 40 years.
Thus, it should come as no surprise that drug offenses over time have
begun to comprise a disproportionate share of arrests and prison
admissions. Figure 1 shows the time trends from 1980 to 2012 in the rate
of arrests for select crimes. The most striking pattern revealed in the
figure is the sharp increase in the rate of arrests for drug abuse
violations compared to arrests for other criminal offenses.
Specifically, over the 32 years for which we have data, arrests for drug
related offenses rose from 255.65 per 100,000 persons in 1980 to just
under 500 per 100,000 in 2012, peaking at 633.25 per 100,000 persons in
2006. An examination of incarceration rates over the same period shows a
similar pattern, where in 1980 the incarceration rate for a drug related
offense was 15 per 100,000 persons, but by 2000, that rate had increased
over tenfold to more than 150 per 100,000. 29 30 31 32 33 D\-- 8/41

surface, the movement toward punitive crime control in the U.S. appeared
to be broad and far\--reaching. When disaggregated by race, however, the
data present a more troubling picture. Despite comprising less than 12%
of the U.S. population in 1980, African Americans made up 44% of the
total amount of state and federal inmates in the same year. By 2000, the
population of African Americans in the U.S. had increased to 12.9%, and
yet they accounted for 46% of all inmates in U.S. state and federal
correctional facilities. In the end, the U.S.' policy of mass
incarceration not only led to an overrepresentation of African Americans
in jails and prisons, but it also reflects a clear policy choice to
inscribe race into the criminal justice system. Perhaps John Ehrlichman,
a former Nixon domestic policy chief, best expresses these sentiments:
34 35 D\-- 9/41 "You want to know what this was really all about...The
Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two
enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm
saying. We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war
or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with
marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily,
we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid
their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night
on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of
course we did." Policing in the Information Age Today, across the U.S.,
dozens of police departments, from Boston to Los Angeles, have turned to
sophisticated data analytics to address criminal justice practices.
Although the use of quantitative data to address crime is not novel,
newer technologies fueled by algorithms, artificial intelligence, and
machine learning enable [law enforcement agencies to harness the power
of big data to predict criminal behavior. This strategy is often
referred to as predictive policing.]{.underline} We adopt our definition
of predictive policing from the RAND Corporation and National Institute
of Justice. They define predictive policing as the "the application of
analytical techniques---particularly quantitative techniques---to
identify likely targets for police intervention and prevent crime or
solve past crimes by making statistical predictions." [Predictive
policing and its tools permit law enforcement to use data to predict
where crime is most likely to happen; assess who is most likely to
(re)offend or be victimized; and form typologies of
offenders.]{.underline} While the goals of predictive policing may be
clear, what remains muddied is what they are doing to accomplish these
goals. However, before we can examine what predictive policing tools are
doing, we must have a better understanding of some of the keywords that
are often used when discussing the subject, namely, artificial
intelligence, supervised machine learning, and algorithm. Artificial
intelligence is an umbrella term used to describe the science and
engineering of creating machines and/or software with the ability to
achieve a goal. , Nested within AI is supervised machine learning.
Supervised machine learning, as a branch of AI, is concerned with using
historical information (i.e., a dataset that includes known input (x)
and output (y) data) to train a model that can be used to predict future
events (or 36 37 38 39 40 41 D\-- 10/41 behavior). An algorithm, on the
other hand, can be defined as a list of instructions for a
step\--by\--step execution of a specific task. Supervised machine
learning algorithms, then, are computer programs that not only try to
achieve a specific goal (e.g., predict the likelihood of crime in
location Y) but also are capable of improving (or maintaining) their
performance in service to that goal when fed new input data As Foster
and colleagues note: "One key distinction in \[supervised\] machine
learning is that the goal is not just to find the best function F that
can predict Y for observed outcomes (known Ys) but to find one that best
generalizes to new, unseen data." Machine learning algorithms have been
applied to a variety of criminal justice contexts. These algorithms can
be used at all stages of the criminal justice process, from determining
where to deploy police officers for maximum impact , to informing bail
decisions (also known as pretrial risk assessment) , to assessing risk
for recidivating among parolees and probationers. Police departments and
other branches of the criminal justice system in cities around the
country have adopted these tools, drawing on both researchers and
university\--based partnerships, as well as proprietary software, to
develop and implement the desired algorithmic tools. One widely known
proprietary tool, PredPol, is the product of a research partnership
between UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, and the Los Angeles Police Department.
According to their website, "PredPol's mission is to provide a crime
prevention platform to keep communities safer. Our...technology places
public safety officers at the right time and location to give them the
best chance of preventing crime." Using machine learning techniques,
PredPol claims to be able to predict where crime is most likely to occur
using only three data points: "crime type, crime location, and crime
date and time." Another example is the COMPAS tool produced by
Northpointe, which applies machine learning algorithms to risk
assessment at the levels of policing and case management, promising
users both a "prospective" and "retrospective look at risk and needs
factors." Yet despite widespread use of these algorithms, touted as
powerful and technologically advanced methods for improving public
safety, their propensity to disproportionately target individuals from
lower\--class neighborhoods and [c]{.mark}ommunities of color remains
starkly understudied and underreported outside of popular news media. 41
43 41 41 46 47 48 49 50 51 D\-- 11/41 [Algorithmic Reasoning as
[Racializing Assemblages]{.mark}]{.underline} Machine learning
algorithms are [being [employed]{.mark} [in]{.mark} many sectors of
[US]{.mark}]{.underline} society [including]{.underline} in the
practices of [[pred]{.underline}i]{.mark}ctive
[[pol]{.underline}]{.mark}icing and criminal justice. Yet, we know less
about the ways in which the [algorithms]{.underline} may become
[part]{.underline} [of a larger]{.underline}
[sociotechnical]{.underline} [apparatus]{.underline} [of sociopolitical
relations]{.underline}. In order to examine this, we put the concept of
algo\--ritmo to work in analyzing the algorithmic legal reasoning of
predictive policing. [Algo\--ritmo seeks to account for both the
immanent agencies of algorithmic acts and the ways in which those acts
become racializing assemblages. In conceptually developing an
understanding of how algorithms may become racializing
assemblages]{.underline}, the first author has argued that it is through
the data that the [[algorithms inherit sociopolitical relations of
society.]{.mark} Data are [not]{.mark} pure, [objective extractions of
the world but rather are assemblages that are produced from a
multiplicity of entwined and mutating apparatuses]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[The apparatuses of data assemblages [include political economy, forms
of knowledge, practices, governmentalities and legalities]{.mark}, and
subjectivities and communities, among others. As assemblages, they are
both [materially and discursively produced from forces of human and
more\--than\--human ontologies]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Among the
multiplicity of forces that make up data assemblages
[include]{.underline} sociopolitical relations that consist of [forces
that differentiate and hierarchize bodies]{.underline}. Thus, all
assemblages of [data]{.underline} are always\--already
[imbued]{.underline} [with]{.underline} varying degrees of
sociopolitical relations and, as such, become part of the (re)programmed
architectures of algorithmic reasoning. For algo\--ritmo, algorithmic
reasoning is not understood to be mechanical operations that are
contingent on human intervention or design. It is postulated that the
systematic operations of algorithms are not simply humanly designed and
modeled or the prosthetic tool to human cognition. In accordance with
Parisi, algorithms are understood to be actual entities that consist of
finite operations of calculation as well as incomputable data sequences.
As actual entities, [[they are sociotechnical ontologies]{.mark} that
are always [in process of]{.mark} [becoming]{.mark} in relation with
[**sociopolitical systems,** **legal practices**, programmed inputs, and
data assemblage]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark}. These are not simply
humanly designed technologies, but rather as algorithms [process and are
[trained]{.mark} [on]{.mark} data [assemblages they become
more\--than\--human ontologies]{.mark}.]{.underline} For Parisi, it is
the 52 53 54 D\-- 12/41 actuality of incomputabilities that provide
instantiation of the immanent forms of algorithmic cognition. That is to
say, operating between the space of finite algorithmic operations and
the incomputability of the world's infinite complexity (i.e.,
information) are forms of speculative reason that are immanent to
computation. If machine learning algorithms consist of immanent forms of
reasoning[, then **the [iterability of predictions or speech
acts]{.mark}** are [more]{.mark}\--[than]{.mark}\--[human
performative]{.mark}]{.underline} acts. [**[Performative acts, or
intra\--actions, are relational acts within entangled entities that
produce ongoing material (re)configurings of the
world]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Building on Barad's diffractive reading of
Foucault's discursive theory and Butler's theory of performativity via
Bohr's conception of matter, [algo\--ritmo engages in morethan\--human
performative acts, in which materiality is discursive and the discursive
is always\--already materi]{.underline}al. It is [[via the iterable
intra\--actions with other relational ontologies that materially
reconfigures the world]{.mark}. Thus, algoritmos matter [through]{.mark}
their iterable intra\--actions with other ontologies, whereby they
[enact, form, shape, and produce both human and more\--thanhuman
bodies]{.mark}. [As agencies that inherit sociopolitical relations via
data assemblages, the immanent forms of reasoning and
more\--than\--human performative acts of algorithms become racializing
assemblages]{.mark}.]{.underline} The theory of [racializing
assemblages]{.underline} seeks to more adequately [account]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} the [processes]{.underline} of [power]{.underline} and
[racializations]{.underline} of the [body/flesh. As argued by Weheliye,
racialization is not to be reduced to race or racism but is the process
of differentiation and hierarchization that produces the assemblages of
race, gender, class, sexuality, and dis/ability among other structural
relations of "difference". The sociopolitical relations of
[racialization]{.mark} are [perpetuated via technologies and
sciences]{.mark} (among other things) and require "the [barring of
nonwhite subjects from the category of the human]{.mark}." Thus, the
data and code of algorithms inherit the sociopolitical relations of
"difference" becoming a performative force of the relational and
connected forces of racializing assemblages]{.underline}. As a way of
drawing a distinction between the legal constitution of the body and the
social designations of the flesh, Weheliye also calls upon Hortense
Spillers' (2003) theorizing of the flesh. As Spillers nsightfully states
["before the 'body' there is 'flesh,' that zero degree of social
conceptualization that does not escape]{.underline} [concealment under
the brush of discourse or the reflexes of iconography..."]{.underline}
[Prior to the legal constitution of the body is the formation of the
flesh, a formation that is bound by the markings or traces of political
violence designating a hierarchy of humanity. The traces of political
violence of the flesh are what Spillers refers to as "**[hieroglyphics
of the flesh" that are produced from the instruments or acts of violence
such as whips, police brutality, mass shootings, or more subtly from the
silence in speech acts]{.mark}**. The [data and code of
algorithmic]{.mark} acts [inherit]{.mark} the sociopolitical forces and
"[hieroglyphics of the flesh]{.mark}" of racializing assemblages from
the iterability of algorithmic intra\--action]{.underline}s. In this
article, we examine the ways in which [[algorithmic]{.mark} [legal
reasoning]{.mark}]{.underline}, as [[materialized]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} practices of [predictive
policing]{.underline}, [becomes [racializing
assemblages]{.mark}.]{.underline} [As will be discussed below,
sociopolitical relations of racializations become part of the
algorithmic architecture in at least two ways. First is by way of the
rationalities behind the metrics that operationalize and constitute the
criterion of prediction. The second is more posthumanist via the
algorithmic intra\--action with data assemblages and through this
process (re)configuring the architecture of the algorithm to becoming
racializing assemblages. By putting the concept algo\--ritmo to work in
a close reading of the existing research and policy literature, we
illuminate these sociopolitical processes.]{.underline}

past two decades, [fields of [knowledge production that utilize
statistics]{.mark} have adopted machine learning as their
[primary]{.mark} mode of operation]{.underline} (Mackenzie, "Programming
Subjects" 434). [Due to the advances of [computational]{.mark}
technology, machines can now be programmed to fnd patterns in large
datasets.]{.underline} '[Machine]{.underline} learners'\[1\]
[r[ecursively use patterns to infer correlations]{.underline}]{.mark}[,
essentially hailing new performative judgments on the
world]{.underline}. Adrian Mackenzie goes so far as to claim that we now
[live within a [regime of predictivity characterized by computational
practices ]{.mark}]{.underline}that rely less on verifcation than
inference and abductive reasoning. With the widespread use of machine
learning practices, abduction creates an overall "sensibility to change
and alter events" (402). By **[[abstracting concrete social practices
into data vectors, machine]{.underline}]{.mark}** learners measure,
[**[forecast and thus modulate human behaviors by essentially scripting
performatives]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Put simply, machine learners have
become some of the most potent social inscription devices today. It is
within this context that I ask -- [how does]{.underline} the recent
ubiquity of [machine learning affect the production of
subjectivit]{.underline}y? As the big data revolution ramps up, much
attention has been drawn to online platforms that modulate political
identities "situated at a distance from traditional liberal politics and
removed from civil discourse" (Cheney-Lippold 165). On two ends of the
extreme, we have seen the rise of white supremacists propagating through
networks that segregate public opinions. Yet, on the 'back end' of
computational culture, [machine learning [algorithms]{.mark}
[de-subjectify human]{.mark} users [for proprietary gain]{.mark}.
Capitalism doesn't care if you're a fascist, a passivist, or even a bot;
so long as it [can extract behavioral information from your actions to
be packaged and resold]{.mark} by its advertisers]{.underline}. As
Cheney-Lippold points out, machine learning shifts the site of
identifcation into the "measurable, digital sphere" (165). Between the
front-end user interface, and the back-end logics of computation ---
[machine learners are [embedded within]{.mark} the powerful
contradictions of [capitalist logics]{.mark}]{.underline}. Amidst this
seeming contradiction, the concept of subjectivity may be an unhelpful
category[. 'Enlightenment Man,' the Cartesian subject divided between
mind and body, the rationalist 'view from nowhere' --- these
[eurocentric notions of subjectivity are founded on the measuring
functions of coloniality and the technological organization of capital
brought to bear on the individual]{.mark}]{.underline}[.\[]{.mark}2\]
Still, technological imaginaries have also been mobilized to trouble
hegemonic notions of subjectivity. Donna Haraway's feminist subjects,
for instance, dethrone the "god-tricks" of scientifc rationalism through
situated technopolitical practices (Haraway, 1988). The notion of
technological subjection, or perhaps more accurately, the notion of
de-subjectivization, occupies a set of complex problems that garner
closer attention. Now emerging scholarship at the intersection of
identity and machine learning has opened new pathways of research in
digital cultural studies. Healy and Fourcade observe that the state used
to be the only apparatus with the technological power to track its
subjects. However, this is no longer the case (Fourcade and Healy). The
recent ability for machine learners to track Brett Zehner: MACHINES OF
SUBJECTION 50 APRJA Volume 8, Issue 1, 2019 online users' digital
footprints, or their "data exhaust," marks an important moment for what
Shoshona Zuboff calls surveillance capitalism. [[Every action]{.mark} a
user performs on a digital system [is]{.mark} considered [a signal to be
analyzed, packaged]{.mark}, and subsequently [fed back into the
system]{.mark}.]{.underline} The quantity of user data is much more
important than quality[. As long as an action online can be converted
into data, it can be utilized in predictive behavioral
models]{.underline}. Zuboff explains that no online action is too
trivial to be aggregated, repackaged, and sold again (79). "Facebook
likes, Google searches, emails, texts, photos, songs, geo-location,
[[communication patterns]{.mark}" are all considered [lucrative]{.mark}
data to marketing frms and myriad other companies]{.underline} (79).
Though let's be clear. Surveillance capital is not merely a social media
concern. [The algorithmic bias of machine learners stems from a long
line of quantitative racism and surveillance]{.underline} (Browne). [The
[targeting]{.mark} of the poorest members of society continues, only now
it [operate]{.mark}s [through]{.mark} various forms of [data
surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline} and predatory credit scoring (Fourcade
and Healy 31). Zuboff argues that technique supplants authority, and
that "[[discipline and control produce a certain knowledge of human
behavior independent of consent]{.underline}" (81).]{.mark} In this
[extractive logic]{.underline}, we see an [impersonal form of subjection
at the heart of surveillance]{.underline} [capital]{.underline}. New
forms of power emerge alienating persons "from their own behavior while
[producing new markets of [behavioral prediction and
modifcation]{.mark}]{.underline}" (75). The [[liberal idea of the
rational decisionmake]{.mark}r then seems to unravel as a locus of power
relations]{.underline}. In The Control Revolution, historian of
technology James Beniger describes the automation of decision theory in
the 1930s. "Any decision tree of fnite length can be duplicated by a
fnite automaton, thereby equating the question of decidability with that
of computability" (64 ). It was the automation of decision theory that
set the stage for the frst machine learning program to be utilized for
economic and military planning by the RAND Corporation in 1955. TungHui
Hu advances this historical analysis by mapping the topography of power
relations within 'cloud computing' where decisions are distributed
across networked assemblages. He argues that borders seem to be out of
date conceptions at the foundation of the sovereign subject (14). The
Tiqqun collective in their [[cybernetic]{.mark} hypothesis]{.underline}
[posit that traditional class divisions and social confict no longer cut
through the middle of society, but through the middle of each of
us.]{.underline} What is troubling is that the [[production of
subjectivity seems to be no longer about creating "people]{.mark} of
substance]{.underline}" but of [[turning each person into a "fleshless
envelope, the best possible conductor of social
communication]{.underline}]{.mark}" (18). And most recently, in the
Trump era, Luciana Parisi links the de-personalization of machine
learning systems to the rise of post-truth politics. Here indeterminacy
and the unknown "push automated cognition beyond knowledge-based
systems" ("Reprogramming Decisionism" 10). What we ultimately fnd within
the political subjection (and de-subjectivation) of machine learners is
a brutal instrumentalism based more on mechanical functions than on
ideological content. Now, despite considering machine learning's effect
on social identity,\[3\] the above scholarship on machine learning has
left open an opportunity for rigorous scholarly attention to
de-subjectivation. For instance, John Cheney-Lippold asks: "What does
the banality of competing for a job interview using machine learning to
predict future friendships say about subject formation" (8)? This line
of questioning still focuses on subjection at the level of performatives
and self-awareness. This limited viewpoint imagines the subject merely
as a 'user' who 51 is always already ideologically 'hailed.' Even though
data analysis seems to aggregate our most intimate habits, surveillance
remains automated and deeply impersonal as it bypasses individuated
modes of subjectivity and signifying semiotics. Both digital media
studies, if focusing merely on identifcation through computational
performatives, is limited in offering any new insights into the forces
at play in our present moment. I argue that the acceleration of
[[predictive techniques]{.mark} and [impersonal forms of control]{.mark}
require a more robust consideration of de-subjection]{.underline}. Along
these lines, tactical [machine learning would have two
[goals]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} First, the goal would [be
[to]{.mark} [update]{.mark} theories of [subjection]{.mark}, and
de-subjection]{.underline}, for the proliferation of machine learning
devices with a keen attention to practices that bypass classical
defnitions of the subject. And second, to provide an analysis of social
practices externalized into the technologies of machine learning. We
must describe and experiment with certain tactical media concepts that
**[[undergird machine learning today -- scenario planning, training, and
prediction]{.underline}]{.mark}**. 2. A tactical media approach to
machine learners Methodologically, a tactical media approach to machine
learning must be situated within the perspectives of media philosophy as
well as the practice of media arts. The legacy of tactical media (and
its forebears in 1960's intermedia, conceptual, and performance art
practices) informs much of my project combining the felds of digital
media with performance studies. For instance, tactical media was
outlined in the late 1990s by David Garcia and Geert Lovink as a set of
practices engaging technology as always being wrapped up in power
relations. The activist ethos of tactical media has been mobilized in
various registers by Rita Raley, The Critical Art Ensemble, and Beatriz
da Costa. In each case, [performance is considered a mediating process
that [enacts technological apparatuses]{.mark}.]{.underline} Each usage
of the term tactical media is [[dependent]{.mark} [upon]{.mark} the
specifc set of [technopolitical relations]{.mark} that the practitioners
hope to intervene within]{.underline}. In the case of Beatriz da Costa
and Kavita Philip, their [[tactical biopolitics]{.underline}]{.mark}
replaces the term 'media' out of a consideration of [specifc
[technoscientifc forms of knowledge production modulating the
possibilities of life]{.mark}]{.underline} (da Costa and Philip). Jussi
Parikka, in a similar manner, mobilizes a geological imaginary to
intervene within extractive environmental politics and digital culture.
In this vein of mapping a specifc set of technopolitical relations, the
title of this essay mobilizes tactical media in the service of exploring
the temporal regimes of machine learners. The title also borrows
directly from Saidiya Hartman's Scenes of Subjection. I hope to expand
on scenographic modes of subjection by drawing on the [cybernetic
imaginary]{.underline} to elucidate forms of [technological
de-subjection]{.underline} at the heart of identity politics. My initial
hypothesis is that through so-called new media regimes, old forms of
[[subjection mutate through the new technopolitical conditions that
arise]{.underline}]{.mark}. I look to unearth the [technologies of
subjection as they traffc through the digital sphere]{.underline}. To
provide insight into the processes of de-subjection I rely on two
threads of critical theory. The frst mode of critical theory that I
utilize comes from post-autonomist marxism and its theories of
[signifcation and [subjection]{.mark} [within]{.mark} the late
capitalist [technosphere]{.mark}]{.underline}. I fnd it useful to
consider the performative statements and decision architectures of
machine learners via the philosophy of language found in the work of
Michel Foucault, and Brett Zehner: MACHINES OF SUBJECTION 52 APRJA
Volume 8, Issue 1, 2019 Félix Guattari. Especially useful is Foucault's
concept of the dispositif [--- the structural yet mutable union [between
institutions, subjectivity, and discourse]{.mark}. He defnes the
dispositif as an autonomous technique which exists "on the other side of
juridical and political structures of representation]{.underline}"
(Foucault 40). The dispositif is [a mechanism of capture, both material
and discursive, which directly manages the experience of everyday
life.]{.underline} Guattari further identities two dispositifs of power
that operate in a contradictory manner. On the one hand, we face systems
of social subjection. Social subjection categorizes us with assigned
identities --- it gives us a gender, a race, a profession --- a position
of symbolic representation. However, the production of an individuated
subject is also coupled with a different process that proceeds though
desubjectivization. Guattari defnes this process as [machinic
enslavement]{.underline} which dismantles the individuated subject,
consciousness, and representations, acting on both pre-personal and
supra-individual levels. In machinic enslavement, [the individual is no
longer instituted as an "economic subject" or a "citizen]{.underline}."
She is [instead considered "a gear, a cog, a component in fnancial and
various other institutional assemblages]{.underline}" (ctd. in
Lazzarato, Signs and Machines 25). For instance -- advertising focus
groups stopped using questionnaires long ago in favor of measuring
biometric response to stimuli such as taste tests or eye tracking.
Capitalism is so successful because it operates heterogeneously at the
intersection of social subjection and machinic enslavement. We are all
caught in a double bind between performative individuation and the
dissolution into our dividual parts, unknown to ourselves. Guattari's
critique (which I extend to the analysis of machine learners) is of
critical theories that deal only with language and/or recognition while
ignoring de-subjectivizing processes and their non-representational
semiotics. Although the post-autonomist critique of technology is quite
useful in understanding both processes of subjection and desubjection
within the logic of computational capital, there is still the problem of
the specifc historical and material contexts in which machine learners
are situated. One must wonder if Guattari's exploration of de-subjection
can fnd a more radical usage today. In this manner, and concerning
de-subjection, the second strain of critical theory we must engage with
is queer-of-color-critique. [We must [turn to the negative identity
politics]{.mark} that refuse to validate, affrm, or strengthen forms of
subjectivity presently produced under capitalism.]{.underline} Recent
antagonistic positions and pessimisms are powerful not because they have
to do with identity "but because they have to do with the "mundane
radicalism of the desire to de-subjectivize all categories" (Menon).
Queer-of-color critique has long grappled with processes of
de-subjection as a crucial step in forming minoritarian collectivity.
Disidentifcation operates "in and against dominant ideologies" while
refusing assimilation. [Hortense Spillers' theorization of the
[flesh]{.mark} and the body is [important to consider]{.mark} in
[relation]{.mark} [to]{.mark} present [data]{.mark} practices [which
**quantify human behaviors**]{.mark}. Spillers positions the distinction
between body and flesh as the central difference "between captive and
liberated subject positions". For Spillers, the body is possessed by an
individual who is the sole owner of their selfhood. Yet for a
[captive]{.mark}, as in the case of chattel slavery, [the body is
reduced to flesh]{.mark}. This flesh is [exposed to violence without
protection from legality, equality, or democracy]{.mark}.]{.underline}
In fact, Jasbir Puar writes that the [[violence]{.mark} of capital is
[legitimated through the right to maim]{.mark}. [Outside of
representation, vision, or ideology]{.mark}, the flesh [records]{.mark}
the primary narrative of the [horrors of liberal
humanism]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is the [suffering of the
flesh]{.underline} which [e[xceeds white
coloniality]{.mark}]{.underline} 53 and acts as [[transgenerational
memor]{.mark}y, highlighting the ways black bodies remain as
flesh.]{.underline} [Spiller's political antagonism is an attention to
the memory of the [flesh existing]{.mark} on the side of the
de-subjectifed, the already [outside]{.mark}, beyond [the]{.mark} limits
of the subject or the [law]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of course, the [right
to [maim]{.mark} [emerges in]{.mark} the [data practices]{.mark}
of]{.underline} predictive policing [[that quantifes black
behaviors]{.mark} which]{.underline} are correlated to racist
databases[. All of this **[digital magic]{.mark} is merely [a weapon to
legitimate police horrors]{.mark}** in the streets.]{.underline}

Viewpoints and Representation of Subordinated Experiences: A Response to
Sabaratnam\] neil

This is a very controversial point and I would not like to be
misunderstood, so let me be clear. Firstly, it is obvious that part of
thinking about African subjects' historical presence is to think in
pan-Africanist terms, not just from the continent but also from the
whole of the diaspora, constructed out of specific experiences of
slavery and abduction so ingrained for the political thought of
anti-colonial thinkers worldwide. African thought makes no sense without
taking account of these broader diasporic and panafricanist connections.
Secondly, as Meera says, Fanon, Césaire, Du Bois and Cabral were all
part and parcel of an anti-colonial movement that spurred independence
across the African continent. Contemporary African thought cannot be
understood without this legacy, Fanon's in particular. Thirdly, Fanon
and Du Bois even went and lived in Africa, and Fanon participated
directly in the Algerian revolution. Finally, they do provide good
guidance for analysing the political significance of interventions in
how they theorised the experience of colonisation and racism. Yet none
of these rationales on its own makes a strong enough justification for
**[diminishing African thinkers' presence]{.underline}**. **[For
instance, [Césaire's
work](http://www.bacfrancais.com/bac_francais/645-cesaire-cahier-retour-pays-natal-poudre-boussole.php)
is tied to [that
of](http://data.bnf.fr/12429906/leopold_sedar_senghor_hosties_noires/)
[Leopold
Senghor](http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb34640871h).]{.underline}**
The Négritude movement that they co-founded was crucial for developing
Fanon's work. The movement was given much echo thanks to the founding of
the journal [Presence Africaine](https://www.jstor.org/journal/presafri)
by Senegalese Alioune Diop. Their thought reflects the ideas that made
the intellectual basis of the anti-colonial movement and as such, can
also be found in the work of many African intellectuals and activists at
the time, not least the so-called founding fathers of independence like
Kwame Nkrumah, Julius Nyerere and Ahmed Sékou Touré. Cheik Anta Diop,
one of the most acclaimed African historians,
[placed](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kcG5vJhnBVwC&pg=PT16&dq=restoration+of+African+Historical+Consciousness&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjS5s7Ip9DYAhVUFMAKHQFEBnYQuwUILDAA#v=onepage&q=restoration%20of%20African%20Historical%20Consciousness&f=false)
"\[t\]he restoration of African Historical Consciousness" as the number
one priority to develop Black Africa's economic basis. This was for him
both a historical and a political argument. He not only wanted to
demonstrate the historical basis for the need to unite as African
peoples but also to
[claim](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kcG5vJhnBVwC&pg=PT16&dq=restoration+of+African+Historical+Consciousness&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjS5s7Ip9DYAhVUFMAKHQFEBnYQuwUILDAA#v=onepage&q=historical%20consciousness%20is%20one%20of%20man%E2%80%99s%20chief%20means%20of%20survival&f=false)
that "\[c\]ollective historical consciousness is one of man's chief
means of survival and a source of creation" and necessary to achieve
political, economic and psychic autonomy. Fast-forwarding a bit, V.Y.
Mudimbe has
[made](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_invention_of_Africa.html?id=-jwNAQAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y)
almost exact claims to those made in the book about the relationship
between forms of knowledge, material distribution and power production.
There is also an **[absence of African voices in the umbrella
theoretical framework the book proposes to understand the broader
structure of power in world politics.]{.underline}** In the book, what
Cabral, Césaire, Du Bois and Fanon propose is ultimately "read through
the concept of coloniality" (p. 47). The relation between the two is at
first sight enlightening but it raises a number of questions: How do
these form a whole from which "to affirm a collective subject that has
been previously negated, denied or ignored but which can share truths
about the nature of oppression?" (p. 53). **[If decolonising strategies
are an appropriate response to the problems of Eurocentrism in research
and provide a more philosophically robust platform for thinking about
global order, what is the "coloniality of power" adding to this already
robust framework]{.underline}**? **[Why do we need such a concept to
"think differently about intervention"?]{.underline}** Alternatively, is
the coloniality of power, as exposed by Quijano, Mignolo and Grosfoguel,
the ultimate framework that elucidates that "\[w\]hen we think about
statebuilding interventions as structured by and through a contemporary
global colonial matrix of power \[...\] it becomes relatively obvious
why, as a project, it would not work in producing or contributing to the
production of autonomous and coherent self-governing political entities"
(p. 137)? If so, what are Cabral et al. adding to the concept of
coloniality? Or, put otherwise, what are these anti-colonial thinkers
offering that the concept of coloniality is not? Ultimately, Quijano,
Mignolo and Grosfoguel very much premise their work on the need to
recover such historical presence, political consciousness and material
conditions in their work. So, while it is argued in the conclusion that
the book has contributed to expand the coloniality of power in
methodological, historiographical and epistemological ways, how is this
so, specifically**[? Finally, to come back to the initial point, if,
again, the coloniality of power is the ultimate umbrella framework,
isn't this creating a hierarchy of voices in which some give us the big
picture, others do the methodological work, while yet others can speak
but only to tell us their experience of oppression? Does this not clash
with the claim about the privileged insight of thinking with subjects
from their histories, consciousness and experiences?]{.underline}** This
last point becomes even more puzzling when in the section about
standpoint feminism we find **[no African women. If Third-World/Southern
women provide the most distinctive viewpoint on systemic violence, and
we need to be wary of essentialising women's and, in general, all
experiences]{.underline}** (p. 28, 52), **[then why not draw from those
writers directly]{.underline}**? Why are most of the **[scholars this
section draws on white Northerners (e.g. Dorothy Smith, Donna Haraway,
Sandra Harding, Nancy Hartsock)?]{.underline}** Meera is trying to
construct, almost chronologically, the main tenets of standpoint theory.
**[However, in so doing, she is missing important insights from African
feminists and in fact, disregarding the reasons]{.underline}** Meera
**[herself is arguing for turning to standpoint feminism to think "with"
rather than "for" "targets."]{.underline}** People like [Amina
Mama](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4066405?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents),
[Pinkie
Mekgwe](http://africaworldpressbooks.com/african-women-and-feminism-reflecting-on-the-politics-of-sisterhood-edited-by-oyeronke-oyewumi)
and [Oyeronke
Oyewumi](http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/9789401205641_011),
for instance, argue that **[African women experience distinctive
circumstances and violence and that the ways of knowing and overturning
such experience requires knowledge of African languages and
cultur]{.underline}**e. We can take up Molara Ogundipe-Leslie's [own
question](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SfzFMvqCJ3IC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA27#v=onepage&q&f=false):
"**[what is the specific condition of the women in
Africa?]{.underline}**" She argues that African women's condition (which
is to be studied with account of the particularities of women's own
class and origin in historical perspective) is defined by the endurance
of colonial realities and the global socio-economic structures of
oppression represented in what she calls "the six mountains on her
back": colonialism, tradition, poverty and ignorance, man, race and
herself (due to her negative self-image). For Ogundipe-Leslie, the
African feminist approach brings theory and action together to claim not
just this distinctive experience and its understanding but also women as
necessary subjects in society's reconstruction. This can be seen as a
blow to interventions in that the problems that they address require
challenging the fundamental structures of society, from tradition and
custom to scientific knowledge and capitalism.

If we consider schooling before the global pandemic [the challenges that
have plagued Black students]{.underline} particularly since the
desegregation of public schooling in the 1970s remain (Love, 2019;
Sizemore, 1978). They [impact the]{.underline} everyday, [material
realities of being (Black) in a society historically]{.underline}
stained and [sustained by racism and white supremacy.]{.underline} And
at the heart of these practices, [one finds a b(l)inding antiblack
sentiment. Antiblackness is an ethos]{.underline} and repertoire of
recurring practices [that negate Blackness and inflict both emotional,
psychic, and physical violence on Black people as they move in spaces
dominated by normative whiteness]{.underline}, especially schools (Grant
et al., 2020). [Given its pervasive legacy and unrelenting presence,
antiblackness]{.underline} looms as a cloud[, hovering over the everyday
realities of being Black in the U.S.]{.underline} (Sharpe, 2016). This
reality, however, is buffered by the recognition that in the long duree
toward an existential Black emancipation and freedom (K. D. Brown,
2021b; Walcott, 2021), [Black people have always]{.underline}, even
under the harshest of societal conditions [lived, loved, and experienced
joy]{.underline} (Quashie, 2021). [The task, for Black
people]{.underline} and in this case, all of those, [including non-Black
people committed to Black education, is to imagine and enact a more
expansive notion of Black humanity]{.underline} (J. Brown, 2021; Warren,
2021) [that embraces Black joy, while disrupting]{.underline} and
enlarging [normative practices of living and]{.underline} schooling.
[Black joy]{.underline} is an affective feeling of pleasure and elation.
It does not rely on what is happening in the world, but [springs forth
from an internal state less dependent on external conditions and is more
an inheritance of living a deep, collective, soulful
humanity.]{.underline} Yet to arrive at this place, we must first begin
by acknowledging the antiblackness of traditional schooling and its
tethering to matters of Black existence---how Black students exist in,
relate to, and encounter varying qualities of normative schooling. In
the section that follows, we present these as problems with: (1) being
seen; When we speak of being seen we refer to the act of looking and
recognition. To be seen means that one gives attention to another by
looking at them. At a deeper level it also means that when looking at
someone that person is recognized for who they are. Someone can look at
something, see that thing, but not really comprehend or know what they
see. The same is true for seeing people, a condition that Black
Americans experience when moving through social spaces defined and
framed by normative whiteness. In the book, Invisible Man, writer Ralph
Ellison (2016) narrates the story of a Black man that slowly realizes he
is moving through a White dominated world that fails to really see or
recognize him. Black women in the U.S. have a long history of
experiencing invisibility and nonrecognition (HarrisPerry, 2011).
Whether their contributions, experiences, knowledges, or personhood,
Black women struggle to be seen, heard, and taken seriously across all
societal arenas. Mainstream K--12 curriculum historically facilitated
Black invisibility and misrecognition. Historian Carter G. Woodson (2000
\[1933\]), the intellectual progenitor of Black History Month, centered
his work on highlighting the missing and inaccurate histories of Black
people in the U.S. and making this knowledge visible to Black people and
the larger society. Black students, from preschool to advanced graduate
studies, navigate the paradox of hyper/invisibility by both standing out
and being ignored. This coterminous relationship is marked by a
condition of not seeing that fails to recognize the full humanity and
individual distinctiveness of Black people.

In this light the search for cultural meaning and personal
meaningfulness in [Afrocentrism is centered on, in Baudrillard's
language, the reduplication of a monolithic Africa tha]{.underline}t, in
turn, [reinforces communal principles in Africa America]{.underline}.
The ideal Africa articulated in Afrocentric signs is one in which, to
paraphrase Baudrillard, nostalgia is energized, in which \... "there is
a proliferation of myths of origin and signs of reality\..."
(Baudrillard 1983: 14). In Afrocentrism, [African values, mores, and
ideas]{.underline}, do not come from an Africa of the recent past, but
[have their origin in distant times.]{.underline} Molefi Asante
proclaims that African-Americans are people of Ma'at (Asante 1990:
93-94). In the information age, these complex Afrocentric principles are
transformed into signs -- an 'X' on a baseball cap, a kente cloth shawl,
a greeting card with "African" designs, linens with "African" motifs.
[From an Afrocentric vantage, these signs embody the communal principles
of a proud Africa America;]{.underline} they lend a strong hand to
African-Americans [as they confront the profound difficulty of being a
black person in a fundamentally racist society. By the same token, as
these signs are commodified in a simulated system of signs, the
reduplicatory power of the Afrocentric image overwhelms the referential
power of the Afrocentric philosophical principle.]{.underline} "X" may
become simply an "in" fashion rather than a symbol for slavery's
annihilation of Africa America's connection to Africa. Kente may stand
for a casual African-American take on Africanity rather than a symbol of
Asante nobility. [The ecstasy of the sign]{.underline}, to borrow again
from Baudrillard, not only [obscures the real and unreal, the simulated
and the dissimulated, but also sparks economic engines which today run
on the high octane fuel of simulation.]{.underline} Through the
circulation of reduplicated signs in the media marketing Afrocentricity
creates in North America a simulated Africa. There are "watered down"
African designs that appeal -- quite profitably -- to increasingly
widespread North American constituencies. There are festivals like
Atlanta's Marché Africain/African Market that attempt to recreate
African markets in North American urban spaces. There are crews of
Hausa, Malinke and Wolof traders, constructing their economic selves as
"real" Africans. They follow the circuit of these festivals lending to
them an "authentic" African presence. And then there are the African
markets in Harlem. The 125th Street market, called the African market,
was until October 1994 a simulation of an African market. The spatial
organization and informal dynamics of the market replicated spatial
organization and informal dynamics of markets in West Africa. On 125th
street, the cultural crossroads of Africa America, Hausa, Songhay,
Fulan, Malinke, and Wolof merchants, self-constructed as monolithic
Africans, sold Africana of no distinct ethnic origin to appeal to the
ideological popularity of a monolithic Afrocentric Africa. They sold
"trademarked" goods to appeal to the more localized tastes. They burned
African incense to evoke the Motherland. They addressed shoppers as
"brother" or "sister" to appeal to a simulated African/African-American
solidarity. They have continued these simulated practices at the Malcolm
Shabazz Harlem Market at 116th and Lenox Avenue. Indeed, the Harlem
markets direct a circulation of ecstatic signs in which difference is
diluted to promote economic activity and profits. By marketing
Afrocentricity at outdoor markets, at trade expositions, in mainstream
retail stores, on catalogue pages or in the virtual markets found on the
Internet a simulated Africa has emerged in North America. By
understanding the importance of the simulation in modern times, West
African merchants, who like their forebears, are known for their
economic adaptability, have marketed Afrocentricity and enhanced
profoundly the profitability of their enterprises in North America. They
are, in fact, dynamic local-level contributors to the global economy,
who implicitly understand the power and ecstasy of the sign. Sitting in
his booth at the Malcolm Shabazz Harlem Market, Issifi Mayaki often
burns Meccan incense. One day I asked him why he burned it. "I like it,"
he said. "It is also good for business. It reminds my clients that I'm
an African. I think they like that. And things that remind the
African-Americans about Africa is good for business."9 Issifi's practice
of contexualizing himself -- in economic settings like the market or
trade shows -- is a central adaptive theme in his capacity to market
Afrocentricity. Capitalizing upon his Africanity and the fact that he
lives in Harlem, the cultural epicenter of Africa America, he and his
compatriots have constructed long -distance trade networks throughout
North America to facilitate the sale of their goods at African-American
festivals. Like the Harlem markets on 125th Street and 116th street and
Lenox Avenue, these festivals are, in fact, simulations of West African
markets. Like all simulations in the age of commodified signs, these
African examples in the New World have made America a sweet land of
opportunity that each year attracts thousands of new West African
immigrants to its shores.

As many social geographers have noted in the redefinition of the term
landscape, we influence our environment to reflect our cultural
practices. Tom Hall cited in (Stroud & Jegels,) posits that space, no
longer simply an area to be travelled across, "is that through which,
and with which, lives take shape, and that biographies of place and life
are intimately interwoven. (Hall in Stroud and Jegels: 2). Berger and
Luckman state that ["cultural groups transform the natural environment
into landscapes using different symbols that bestow different meanings
on the same]{.underline} physical objects or [conditions]{.underline}.
These symbols and meanings are sociocultural phenomena; they are social
constructions (Berger & Luckmann cited in Greider & Garkovich 1994)
Ferdinand de Saussure proclaimed, "A science that studies the life of
signs within society is possible.... I shall call it semiology (from
Greek semeion, 'sign')" (de Saussure cited in Van Leeuwen 2004). Van
Leeuwen goes on to note that, "Social semiotics is not 'pure' theory,
not a self-contained field. It only comes into its own when it is
applied to specific instances and specific problems, and it always
requires immersing oneself not just in semiotic concepts and methods as
such but also in some other field" (Van Leeuwen 2004). Abrahamson cites
Hopkins, providing a further definition of semiotics; "Semiotics, the
study of sign and sign systems is an analytical tool of critical theory
used to interpret cultural creations" (Hopkins in Abrahamson 1999: 2).
Socio-semiotics becomes effective when applied to a specific location or
space, or context. Without said context, the study of the symbol is
reduced to fixed meaning, an objective discourse that should be readily
avoided as previously noted (Van Leeuwen, 2004). [The context is what
provides each symbol with its meaning.]{.underline} "Whenever discourses
travel across the globe, what is carried with them is their shape, but
their value, meaning, or function do not travel along. Value, meaning,
and function are a matter of uptake, they have to be granted by others
based on the prevailing orders of indexicality, and increasingly also
because of their potential 'market value' as a cultural commodity"
(Blommaert cited Jaworksi and Thurlow 2010: 17)// The schools of
humanist Geography, semiotics and the work of Henri Lefebvre describe
space outside of its common association towards theoretical mathematics
and commodification. The humanistic turnaround of the theory of space
provides a critical framework to research questions concerning the
ideological orientation of space. Henri Lefebvre's theory of space
provides a unified theory towards decoding the phenomenon of
meaning-making through space and its effect on producing the social
agents in spaces themselves. Lefebvre, Harvey and Sorlin all emphasize
the social construction of space. [These "markers of
territory]{.underline}" (Sorlin in Jaworksi and Thurlow 2010) [represent
contestation between spatial actors in the social production of
space.]{.underline} Lefebvre takes this one step further however and
posits that [space is hegemonically controlled by a globalised order of
capitalism.]{.underline} Lefebvre relies on Marx's theory of space and
posits that [we turn from product to production within space we will be
in the process of freeing ourselves from a hegemonic control over
space.]{.underline} He goes on to posit how the control over spaces are
maintained by the illusion of transparency and opacity. He also posits
how the space is socially produced and reproduced through the spatial
triad. A hegemonic globalised space concludes that within it, there
exists no room for other ideas of space. Space is constructed socially
now more than ever, with the advent of technological utopias and our
drifting relationship with physical space; most notably characterized by
an increasing global disregard for the physical presence and the effects
our actions have on our natural space. Lefebvre posits that [when we
reconnect and produce new spatial coding in physical we subvert the
global hegemonic order which functions largely through the coding of
global capitalism.]{.underline} While the philosophical consideration of
Lefebvres' theory of space can be far-reaching, and beyond the scope of
this paper, his description of hegemonic control of spaces is a useful
insight into the production of space.

### Defense

#### Uniqueness that meaning is [dissuasive]{.underline} is our [solvency]{.underline} mech -- we accelerate black submarine syntaxes to disrupt [white]{.underline} hyperreality

**Gillespie 17** (John Gillespie, Occupy Towson leader & Co-Founder of
the Organized Network of Student Resistence, "On the Prospect of
Weaponized Death," *Propter Nos*, Volume 2: Issue 1, Insurgency /
Exhaustion, Fall 2017)

**[Black life is lived in a white hyper-reality]{.underline}**. By this
I mean, [black life is lived inside a constituted **white fiction**
which concretizes itself as fact]{.underline}. Black life is a life
lived in non-existence; blackness "exists" as a symbol of death that is,
but is not. Blackness "exists" only insofar as White Being structures it
onto a map of anti-black violence.4 Achille Mbembe corroborates this in
his Critique of Black Reason, stating: Racism consists, most of all, in
substituting what is with something else, with another reality. [It has
the power to **distort the real** and to **fix affect**, but it is also
a form of **psychic derangement**, the mechanism through which the
repressed suddenly surfaces]{.underline}. When the racist sees the Black
person, he does not see that the Black person is not there, does not
exist, and is just a sign of a pathological fixation on the absence of a
relationship. We must therefore consider race as being both beside and
beyond being.5 [The reality that replaces that which *is* is a **white
hyper-reality**]{.underline}. [This white hyperrealism **fixes
blackness** as "a sign of a pathological fixation."]{.underline} White
hyper-realism is the paradigm whereby consciousness is unable to
distinguish between the fictions created by White Being and the Real. It
is this fact that permits black death to be subsumed in simulations by
each and every (analytic) encounter with Whiteness and the World.
Questions like, "Can the Black suffer?" and "Is it capable for the Black
to be wronged?" arise due to the inability to access a grammar of
suffering to communicate a harm that has never ended, a harm that can
never end without ending the World itself. It is for this reason that
viral videos of black death, more than opening the possibility for
liberal notions of justice, seem to suture the relationship between the
mythical and the real that perpetuates itself through the reification of
black trauma. Black death, more than deconstructing the ontics of the
Human, seems to extend its hyper-reality. Black death makes it harder to
distinguish white fictions from any sense of real harm being done to
human flesh. The Black is meant to experience its death over and over
and over again; and the World itself recycles all its
fictions-as-the-Real. Put differently, the White World subjects the
Black to perpetual, gratuitous violence, and then uses that violence as
evidence to further suggest that the Black is not Human. For how can a
Human endure such a thing? The experience of gratuitous violence secures
the semiotics of the white hyper-reality. White Disneyland stays intact.
Blackness exists at the nexus of fact and fiction, possibility and
(non)value, inclusion and exclusion. Blackness is trapped even in saying
it's trapped because the "trapped-ness" of the Black extends to
locations where the diction and syntax of White "words don't go."6 The
Black does not have the grammar to speak against where and how it is
trapped since Blackness can only articulate itself through the semiotics
of Whiteness. That White Being continues to center black death as the
matrix of possibility for its hyper-realist structure indexes the
promise of death insofar that White Being is promised futurity. The
Black was rendered fungible through the conjunction of the political and
the libidinal economy of the anti-Black world. Blackness gave birth to
the commodity and the economy of signification that structures the
cartography of the Human's coordinates. This could be said to be a still
birth, insofar as the nature of Black life in a white hyper-reality is
conducted on a plane that guarantees natal alienation, social, and
ontological death. The Black body lives to die; the specter of death
shadows it everywhere. [What matters crucially here, in our invocation
of the hyper-real, is the importance of the **Symbolic**]{.underline}.
The Symbolic is what "structures the libidinal economy of civil
society."7 The Symbolic here is understood as ["the representational
process" that structures "the **curriculum and order of
knowledge**"]{.underline} [and/or "the descriptive statement of the
human"]{.underline} in our contemporary World.8 And in this World, white
symbolism is everywhere. In fact, [in an **anti-Black paradigm**, white
symbolism is everything]{.underline}. [White symbolism
**over-determines** **itself** as the Symbolic itself, and denounces
anything that challenges its **genre-specific mode of
knowing**]{.underline}, seeing and understanding the World. In other
words, [white symbolism holds a **monopoly on the
Symbolic**]{.underline} [in ways that operate]{.underline}
"[lawlikely]{.underline} so [within the terms of their]{.underline}/our
order-specific [modes of]{.underline} adaptive cognition-for,
[truth-for]{.underline}."9 [There is no outside to
whiteness]{.underline}, to white semiotics, to white constructs of value
and reality, to white structuring of libidinal value. And for this
reason, like Wilderson, "\[I\] am more interested in the symbolic value
of Whiteness (and the absence of Blackness\'s value)..."10 in a world of
white hyper-reality. [If Blackness is lived in the hyper-real, then
there is a hyper-intensification---an overrepresentation---of semiology
that dictates the coercive violence of the Black's
(non)existence.]{.underline} **[The semiotics of White
Being]{.underline}** [is the factitious fiction that **simulates the
entire World**]{.underline}. [White Being and black death are part of a
**globally blood-soaked symbolic exchange** that has extended itself
over the terrain of the World to such an extent that there can be **no
distinguishing** between the **Real and the Non-Real**]{.underline}.
White Being is that Being for whom ontological capacity exists, whereas
the Black is the antithesis to Being, that fleshly matter whose essence
is incapacity. 11 [If "language is the house of being,"]{.underline}12
as [Heidegger puts it, then Blackness is trapped at the very center of
White Being. Dionne Brand puts it concisely when she writes, "We are
people without a translator. The language we use already contains our
demise and any response contains that demise as each response emboldens
and strengthens the language it hopes to undermine]{.underline}."13 This
abject positionality was codified through a violence so epochal that
Modernity itself can be said to have been inaugurated through it.
**[However, at the same time, "the center is, paradoxically, within the
structure and outside it."]{.underline}**14 That black death and
anti-blackness exist in this liminal positionality posits the impossible
possibility of a rupture in the moment. For **[that which is inside the
structure, only through being outside the structure, enables the
possibility of both sedimentation and disorientation]{.underline}**.
Jacques Derrida writes, "The function of this center was not only to
orient; balance, and organize the structure--- one cannot in fact
conceive of an unorganized structure---but above all to make sure that
the organizing principle of the structure would limit what we might call
the freeplay of the structure."15 If black death centers the structure,
then it is somewhere in the perfection and expansion of this antagonism
(the inside-outside antagonism) that the cartography of gratuitous
anti-Black violence is laid out. [What might happen when what **orients
the structure** becomes **insurgent**, **attacking the structure**
through that **which centers its very Being**]{.underline}? What might
happen if black death became weaponized in order to further limit the
freeplay of the structure---the expansion of White Being? Afro-Pessimist
thinkers, in favor of a diagnostic analysis, tend to veer away from the
tradition of critical social theory that prescribes solutions to the
analysis in the conclusion of their work. However, one finds throughout
Afro-Pessimist literature a battle cry, a prophetic vision, a pulsing
pessimist hope for the "end of the World." For [if Whiteness **ended
Worlds** through its **colonial simulations** and violent transmutations
of Africans into Blacks, then **the only way out is an end to the White
World**]{.underline}. White Being is irredeemable, and so is the World
it fosters. Sexton says, "In a world structured by the twin axioms of
white superiority and black inferiority, of white existence and black
non-existence, a world structured by a negative categorical
imperative---'above all, don't be black'---in this world, the zero
degree of transformation is the turn toward blackness, a turn toward the
shame, as it were, that 'resides in the idea that \'I am thought of as
less than human.'"16 It's only through black vigilance that the
simulacra of White Being is made clear and the spectacle ofgratuitous
freedom is made visible. It is somewhere in this structural antagonism,
that on the one hand conditions the possibility of the World, and on the
other hand conditions the possibility of its end, its limitations, its
disorientation, that we found the language to say the unsayable and do
the undoable. As Frank Wilderson reminds us: Black Studies in general
and Afro-Pessimism in particular present non-Black academics with more
than an intellectual problem. It presents them with an existential
problem. The reason is because there's an aspect of Afro-Pessimism that
we don't talk about...which is that were you to follow it to its logical
conclusion, it's calling for the end of the world...it wants the death
of everyone else in the same way that we experience our death , so that
one could not liberate Blacks through AfroPessimism and be who one was
on the other side of that. That's the unspoken dynamic of
Afro-Pessimism.17 [If we are engaging in a war in which the symbolic
value, the semiotics of this World itself, positions "the Black as death
personified]{.underline}, the White as personification of diversity, of
life itself,"18 [then resistance needs]{.underline} an "unspoken
dynamic." It needs [a space where "words don't go"]{.underline}---a form
of **[guerrilla linguistics, a submarined syntax]{.underline}**, an
undercommon communication. Perhaps, [here]{.underline}, **[where the
conversation is blackened]{.underline}**, and the theory is phobogenic,
and the journal is Propter Nos, [we can allow ourselves to **excavate
insurgent dictions** still **lost in the lingua franca of White Being**,
**but full of** the specter of black terror, **black
disorientation**]{.underline}.

#### Dissuasion is [not absolute]{.underline} -- discursive politics are possible [despite]{.underline} lack of one-to-one correspondence between signifier and signified

**Mattson 12**, professor of German politics and culture, Rhodes
College, (Michelle, "Rebels Without Causes: Contemporary German Authors
Not in Search of Meaning," Monatshefte Volume 104, Number 2, Summer
2012)

While I find Liesegang's argument plausible, **[there are other
explanations for this apparent disinterest and disengagement outside of
Baudrillard's theory of the postmodern condition]{.underline}** or a
desire to neutralize the German past, although it does have to do with
socio-economic status. One of the things that many of us familiar with
German culture admire about it is the state's commitment to creating
livable conditions for virtually all of its citizens. The social welfare
network in Germany (indeed in Western Europe more broadly) may be under
siege in the current economic climate, but from health care to housing
the state has managed to offer its citizens a level of basic support
that Americans cannot really fathom and---as the most recent health care
debate demonstrated---in large numbers appear not to condone. Thus,
[the]{.underline} glaring [need for individual citizens]{.underline} [to
offer their services to their fellow human beings has remained somewhat
underdeveloped]{.underline} in Germany (Wiedermann and Held) [and has
led to a set of expectations that the government will address the
society's most basic needs]{.underline}. [Recent studies of
volunteerism]{.underline} in Germany **[indicate that this is changing
and that a substantive portion of the population]{.underline}** **[now
gives of its time to myriad social organizations]{.underline}** in ways
that would seem entirely futile to the characters in the texts analyzed
here.13 Furthermore, sociological and social psychological studies
indicate that [people who volunteer do feel a greater connection to
other people and a greater level of personal satisfaction than those who
do not.]{.underline}14 The findings of this research, as mentioned
above, \[End Page 258\] have led me to question whether the literature
analyzed in this article reflects the perspective of a highly specific
section of German society far more than it offers a broader portrait of
central European society today, namely that of a disaffected, disengaged
intellectual class that no longer sees itself as called upon to
participate in the improvement of society now that the great German
political problem of the 20th century appears to have been "solved."
This may have something to do with the specific situation of Germany in
the first decades after the fall of the Wall but it may also be a result
of the socio-economic structures of the Federal Republic. [I do not wish
to present here an overly simplified]{.underline} and naïve
[argument]{.underline} [that Hermann's characters should go out and get
involved in volunteer organizations]{.underline} and that doing so would
make the pervasive sense of sadness and ennui vanish. [Nor would it
necessarily reorient the consumerist attitudes or patterns of
consumption]{.underline} of Naters' group of friends or Regener's Herr
Lehmann into more socially productive outlets. **[However, I do question
the individual, social, and even aesthetic value of wallowing in
indecision and isolation and presenting them as representative of a
crisis in human subjectivity]{.underline}**. Steven [Best describes the
world]{.underline} according to Baudrillard **[as "an abstract
non-society devoid of cohesive relations]{.underline}**, social meaning,
and collective representation" (Best 51). The characters of Mau Mau,
Herr Lehmann, and the stories of Sommerhaus, später and Nichts als
Gespenster inhabit the same or at least a similar world to
Baudrillard's. Thus [Baudrillard's work offers an effective tool in
understanding the implications of the world these literary characters
inhabit and their creators' perspective]{.underline} on contemporary
German society. [Their world, however**, is itself a human
projection**]{.underline}, **[a choice. It is an interpretation of
reality that allows individuals to become resigned and
passive.]{.underline}** Furthermore, it is a perspective possible only
from a position of relative affluence. [I shall not venture to judge
whether Baudrillard's diagnosis]{.underline} of postmodern society [is
accurate]{.underline}, although it appears that many of Germany's
current writers agree with him or were influenced by postmodern theories
of late 20th-century consumerist societies[. I can]{.underline},
however**[, say in conclusion that it is not helpful or productive on
either an individual or social level in imagining ways of living in
today's world]{.underline}**. As Steven Best points out: [Baudrillard's
radical rejection]{.underline} [**of referentiality is premised upon a
one-dimensional,** No-Exit world of self-referring simulacra.
But]{.underline}, [however, reified and self-referential postmodern
semiotics is,]{.underline} **[signs do not simply move in their own
signifying orbit]{.underline}**. **[They are historically produced and
circulated and while they may not translucently refer to some
originating world, they none the less can be socio-historically
contextualized, interpreted, and critiqued.]{.underline}**(57) In other
words, **[human beings generate the simulacra in specific historical
contexts that are subject to interpretation and
challenge.]{.underline}** **[Regardless of how pervasively the media
spin our reality, real people suffer
and]{.underline}**---[occasionally]{.underline} \[End Page 259\]
**[prosper]{.underline}**---**[because of political decisions made at
the local, national, and international level]{.underline}**. **[Media
images may overpower us, but they shouldn't make us lose sight of the
real ramifications of political and economic development]{.underline}**.
[Many critics have suggested that Baudrillard's chief
accomplishment]{.underline} [was to serve as an agent
provocateur.]{.underline} In an interview with Mike Gane, [Baudrillard
himself saw his method of reflection as "provocative,
reversible]{.underline}, \[ . . . \] [a way of raising things to the
'N'th power]{.underline} \[ . . . \] **[It's a bit like a
theory-fiction"]{.underline}** (Poster 331). [One could argue that this
is precisely the function of such novels and short stories as the ones
examined here: to provoke us]{.underline}. **[But to what
end?]{.underline}** Naters, Regener, and Hermann all write very readable
literature, and they challenge us to understand the world of the
insipid, self-centered, and myopic characters that they have created.
[It would indeed be a disservice to the authors to imply that they do
not view their own characters with **critical distance**]{.underline}.
Thus, I am not suggesting that they believe their readers should emulate
the characters they have created. [They have not, however, successfully
demonstrated either why we should care about them
or]{.underline}---[more importantly]{.underline}---[what we can learn
from them]{.underline}.

#### [11. Double]{.underline} Turn -- rooting out [residual]{.underline} links is a will to transparency, holding subjects [responsible]{.underline} -- aff on [presumption]{.underline}

**Baudrillard 93** (Jean, Prof of Phil at EGS, [The Transparency of
Evil]{.underline}, p 165//shree)

We live in a culture which strives to return to each of us full
responsibility for his own life. The moral responsibility inherited from
the Christian tradition has thus been augmented, with the help of the
whole modern apparatus of information and communication, by [the
requirement that everyone]{.underline} should [be answerable for every
aspect of their lives]{.underline}. What this [amounts to]{.underline}
is [an expulsion of the other, who has]{.underline} indeed
[become]{.underline} perfectly [useless in the context of a programmed
management of life]{.underline}, a regimen where everything conspires to
buttress the autarky of the individual cell. This, however is an
absurdity: no one can be expected to be entirely responsible for his own
life. [This]{.underline} Christian-cum-modern idea [is
futile]{.underline} and arrogant. It is also a utopian notion with no
justification whatsoever. [It requires that the individual]{.underline}
should [transform]{.underline} himself [into a slave to]{.underline} his
[identity]{.underline}, his [will]{.underline}, his
[responsibilities]{.underline}, his [desire]{.underline};
[and]{.underline} that he should start [exercising control of
all]{.underline} his own circuitry, as well as all the [worldwide
circuits that happen to cross paths within]{.underline} his genes,
nerves or [thought: a truly unheard of servitude.]{.underline}

#### [12. White]{.underline} Transparency Good -- blacks should dip [in]{.underline} and [out]{.underline} io visibility to remain indecipherable -- but white populists must [remain]{.underline} mappable -- counter-gazing slavemasters key to anticipate them -- total relativism obscures accountability

College, *Red Pedagogy*, p 114//shree)

[In a postmodern world where]{.underline} \"[everything is
everything]{.underline}: critical [scholars critique]{.underline} the
practice of framing questions or \"difference" [**exclusively** in terms
of]{.underline} the cultural and discursive (e.g.
[language,]{.underline} signs, [tropes]{.underline}), [**cutting them
off** from the structural causes and **material** relations that create
"difference."]{.underline} They argue that [reducing political struggles
to **discursive** arguments not only displaces]{.underline}
explanation---[knowledge for social change]{.underline}---[with
resignification but]{.underline} also [authorizes a retreat from social
and political transformation]{.underline}. According to McLaren (1998.
242) such [postmodern tactics promote]{.underline} \"an ontological
agnosticism\" that not only relinquishes the primacy of social
transformation but also encourages a kind of [\"epistemological
relativism\" that calls for]{.underline} the [tolerance of a wide range
of meanings without advocating any]{.underline} single [one of
them]{.underline}. Therefore, critical scholars contest the
[**over**blurring of boundaries]{.underline}, the reduction of
difference to matters of discourse, and the emphasis on local over grand
narratives, contending that such \"tactics\" serve to [obfuscate

the pulse found within the flesh as a critical site for thinking through
alternate ways of being, within the messiness, the unstable, the
precarious; finding life born of transition, the pulse within discord. I
am wondering what queering the relation between the human and other
forms of life, queering the relation between life and non-life, or
undoing the sovereignty of relation altogether, will mean for the Black
body. My inclination is to ask not what form can do to enable or open
itself to queerness, but to ask whether form will let Blackness live.

---Fred Moten, "In the Break: The Aesthetics of the Black Radical

representations of an iconic feature of the American landscape, the
Mississippi River. The first representation was created by J.T. Lloyd in
1862 and maps the contours of the Mississippi River as it stretches from
St. Louis until it spills out into the Gulf of Mexico. Created with
painstaking acuity, Lloyd claims to detail each "sugar plantation,
cotton plantation, city, town, landing, sand bar, island, bluff, bayou,
cut-off, steamboat channel, mileage, fortification 56 This work is

the river (see Figure 1). Llyod was so confident in his ability to
accurately render each figure, that he includes a guarantee to any
potential customer, printed in all caps and italicized stating
"WARRANTED CORRECT, OR THE MONEY REFUNDED" (see Figure 1). Lloyd's map
is one that is meant to convey trust to its viewer. He promises a way to
literally navigate that which is immense, powerful, and overwhelming.
Herein lies the power of the map as a representational image. By
rendering the Mississippi River as a winding blue line, it becomes
knowable. This blue line has become a commonplace icon for waterways. It
[assumes a sense of linearity, directionality, and discretion assuaging
the anxiety]{.underline} of a wild raging river, [a force to contend
with]{.underline}. [Containing]{.underline} the river in this way
inherently [shifts]{.underline} [what we understand]{.underline} the
river to be. [No longer a subject that exerts effect; flooding,
spreading sediment, changing direction]{.underline}, the river is
[rendered as an object upon which people extract and enact force,
leveeing its edges, expanding and condensing its channels, once bespoke
with reverence now succumb to the folly of control. This representation
of knowability aestheticized through the form of the single linear line
is a necessary precursor for the coming management and taming of the
river]{.underline}. Geographer Clyde Woods draws our attention to the
[political economy]{.underline} of the river and the [parallels between
its taming and the taming of surplus labor]{.underline}. He writes: Yet
the promise of swift destruction posed by annual flooding required an
[extremely high level of coordination, study, experimentation, and
infrastructure development ...]{.underline} [The desire of planters to
control]{.underline} both the African American majorities and the annual
ravages of the region's rivers [led to the creation]{.underline} of
extremely high levels [of]{.underline} class [and ethnic solidarity
between the planters and working-class]{.underline} Whites. The
intersection of these trends marked the birth of the Delta as the
[superplantation]{.underline} region of the South (Woods 2017: 28). In
this reading, the map is never simply an aesthetic abstraction of the
world into two dimensional form. Instead it is always imbricated in
politics, power, differentiation, industry, and territoriality. The
second representation is one of unbridled tangles, and recursively
looped waterways that flow, spread, and interrupt each other, a
cacophony of effusion, a watery din. It was created in 1944 by Harold
Fisk who was employed by the Army Corp of Engineers. This map charts all
of the variant alluvial paths that the Mississippi River has taken over
time. Rather than treating the Mississippi as a body that can be managed
and relegated to a transit corridor, this map seeks to understand the
evolution of the river and its many iterations over time (see Figure 2).
Sourced primarily from aerial photography, Fisk's map is robust,
spilling cascading colors over a muted background; it demands attention
drawing the eye to the circuitous routes of flow. The river transgresses
its present path of flow signified by negative space, and works as an
agential body replenishing the land with silt and sediment. Fisk's map
is not one of delimiting a living body as knowable. Instead, it presents
the frictions inherent within the logics of the map, highlighting the
spatial temporal problem of fixing. It is imbued with a liveliness that
undermines the hubris of management and requires reverence. By
visualizing the river in this way Fisk creates a sense of tension
between that which we have come to know as discrete and linear, the blue
line, and the unleveed bends of alluvial shift that exist in the
excesses of interdiction. His interpretation of the data into a visual
form, while accurate, deemphasizes the linearity of the river, literally
showing the present path as negative space. These decisions regarding
the aesthetics of representation open up the map as a meaningful form to
contend with change and flux, rather than inhering within fixed
relationships of time and space. It is also an invitation to linger in
the space between positivist notions of empiricism and interpretive
visualization. 57 Romi Ron Morrison • Gaps between the digits idj 25(1),

geographer Denis Cosgrove would say that these maps are simultaneously
"true representations and virtual spaces."1 This is not meant to deny
the truth of [data]{.underline} but to situate that truth as
[particular, subjective,]{.underline} and [limited, rather than
reproducible, universal, and omnipotent]{.underline}. Such discussions
regarding truth and techniques of representation, however, are not new
but perennial with each emerging technology. The map as a visual
representation of truth through data streams is no different, limited in
its ability to capture reality, in turn producing that which it seeks to
describe. On this point, artist and cartographer Laura Kurgan reminds
us: their basis in remotely sensed data helps us understand what has
become of truth in the era of the digital data stream: it is intimately
related to resolution, to measurability, to the construction of a
reliable algorithm for translating between representation and reality.
The fact that they are virtual images does not make them any less true,
but it should make us pause and consider what we mean today by truth"
(Kurgan 2013: 12--13). This paper begins in that pause. This work
contributes to scholarship that theorizes the [mutual constitution of
race, gender, and sexual difference by examining the ways that
quantitative methods of analysis, undergirded by large scale data
collection, codify difference as singular, comparative, and
managed.]{.underline} Such approaches can only profess relevance in the
subsequent effects of single issue oppression, bearing little promise
for those lives not lived singularly.2 In particular, I analyze The
HUMAN Project, a big data research project run by NYU's Institute for
the Interdisciplinary Study of Decision Making and the Kavli Foundation
and which aims to "map the human condition". I place this project within
a larger critical conversation highlighting the ways that [**[empirical
methods]{.mark} claim universality while [reifying]{.mark} the
[differentiation]{.mark} [upon]{.mark} which [heteropatriarchal white
supremacy]{.mark} depend**s]{.underline}. With a strong emphasis on
approaching questions of information design through critical humanities
scholarship, I hope to make a [tear in the axiomatic power that
empirical [data]{.mark} purports]{.underline} and to trouble the ways in
which design [[upholds]{.mark} such power through representational
aesthetics of cleanliness, modernity, and knowability]{.underline}. I
chart the ways that [data constructs and [fixes blackness to the
bod]{.mark}y, and how such representations [typify]{.mark} particular
**[social imaginaries]{.mark}** that justify and [perpetuate violence on
those same bodies]{.mark}. Moreover, I question the dependency of using
**[tools of analysis, metrics, and quantification to redress]{.mark}
such [violence]{.mark}, asking what the [limits to the visions of
justice]{.mark}** that they suggest are]{.underline}. Towards that end,
I offer a reading of the flesh as a [critical site that troubles
actuarial instruments by engaging with the violence of racialization and
the excesses of knowability. Or put far more eloquently by warrior-poet
theorist Audre Lorde, "[The master's tools will never dismantle the
master's house]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Lorde 2015: 2). This requires
[speculation to operate in the excesses of our current tools, past their
delimiting logics. Differentiated from the body (as individual and
agential), I argue for the flesh as an alluvium site of relationships
that refuse to be parsed, neither self-contained or singular, but
intertwined, affective, irresolute, and extimate in their
connections]{.underline}.3 2. As HUMAN as an acronym 10,000 New Yorkers,
4,000 households, 20 years, 1 research platform; [solving the puzzle to
a better, longer life]{.underline}. These are the claims that sit at the
center of The HUMAN Project (Figure 3). [Buttressed between the promise
of big data]{.underline} and large scale beneficence, The Human Project
is described by its team of creators as "a pioneering research platform
that aims to solve the toughest 60 Romi Ron Morrison • Gaps between the
digits idj 25(1), 2019, 56--70 problems we face today." The description
continues, "[The breakthroughs will come from seeing how the millions of
invisible connections between our bodies, behavior, and the environment
shape us and determine our future. Together, we can reveal the big
picture to creating a better world]{.underline}." ("The Human Project",
2017). In this paper, I query whose bodies count and whose behaviors
matter. In short, [how can we come to shape a future that does not
merely replicate the attendant violence of the past]{.underline}? The
contours of The HUMAN Project resemble a growing body of research by
which big **[[data]{.mark} is [crucial]{.mark} [for shaping human
behavior]{.mark}, making sense of complexity, and [making]{.mark} a
better]{.underline}** (read as more **[[technocratically controlled,
predictable, and managed) world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Yet, it is the
critical site of the human subject and its accordant representations
within which I intervene. In this context human becomes "HUMAN", an
acronym for the project meaning, Human Understanding through Measurement
and Analytics. [You are no longer a body. Instead "**[you" is simply the
moving amalgam of discrete legible indicators counted and used to trade
in authority]{.mark}**, claiming the ability to "quantify the human
condition". With an overemphasis on "everything" being the scope and
scale]{.underline} of [data collection]{.underline}, the HUMAN project
is opaque in its detailing of the data types it seeks to retain, though
it hints at a few possibilities. When asked about the types of data
collected, The Human Project states: This [**[includes financial,
educational, criminal justice]{.mark}**]{.underline} and health records
as well as information about their daily habits such as what they eat,
where they go, when they sleep, how they exercise, and their [patterns
of communication and interaction]{.underline} (Frequently Asked
Questions 2017). Missing from this response is any clear indication into
the sources or metrics for such data. The use of vague phrases such as
"[[patterns of communication]{.mark}"]{.underline} obscures vital
questions as to what is being collected. Are participants meant to

and loved ones, or just the frequency and locations of communications
exchanged? While the HUMAN project may be the most ambitious of its
kind, it is certainly [not alone in its desire to organize the body into
taxonomies of social definition and behavioral
understanding.]{.underline} In their anthology "Deviant Bodies: Critical
Perspectives on Difference in Science and Popular Culture", Jennifer
Terry and Jacqueline Urla detail the ways the [body is discursively
formed through technique and method.]{.underline} They state: [Bodies do
not exist in terms of an a priori essence, anterior to techniques and
practices that are imposed upon them]{.underline} ... In short,
[[bodies]{.mark} [are points]{.mark} on which and from which [the
disciplinary power o]{.mark}f scientific [investigations]{.mark} and
their popular appropriations [is exercised]{.mark}. Knowable only though
culture and history, they are not in any simple way natural or ever free
from relations of power]{.underline} (Terry & Urla 1999: 3). Echoing
Bazin's attention to the eye of the photographer in framing [the
"objectivity" of the camera, Terry and Urla remind us that the
[body]{.mark} itself is not a universally self-evident figure, but it is
rather always [discursively framed]{.mark} [through]{.mark} the eye of
particular investigatory [techniques]{.mark} and [culturally]{.mark}
lodged [research]{.mark} questions.]{.underline} Their work helps to
[[situate]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [body]{.mark}]{.underline} of the
HUMAN project [as a [compilation of particular choices, assumptions, and
protocols]{.mark} inherent in both the researchers, their instruments of
measure, and the institutions sponsoring the projec]{.underline}t.
Through the [machinations]{.underline} of the HUMAN project, [the [body
becomes known through the data streams that it generates, limited by
what can be counted and collected]{.mark}]{.underline}. By reading
Bazin, Terry, and Urla, together the [body]{.underline} of the HUMAN
project is [defined by the quantitative techniques and modes of analysis
that the project's researchers undertake, and implicates them in the
constructive process of giving that body form.]{.underline} I situate
the HUMAN project as a provocation to consider the limits of what can be
made knowable through dependencies on quantifiable data. Entering
through the project's namesake, I [strip away attenuated layers
searching for the body of a human situated in the elsewhere of another
time. Centering the flesh of blackness, I outline the ways that black
construction is always positioned as the outlier upon which
significations of the human are dependent. This ontological paradox
opens the possibilities for the flesh to meaningfully engage with
unknowability]{.underline}. Contrasted with uncertainty, the following
sections trace the [contradictions, productive tensions, and connections
between blackness, flesh, and data sets needed to emerge differently
situated upon fertile soil]{.underline}. 3. Fixing logics: Building the
set How might we go about thinking and living enfleshment otherwise so
as to usher in different genres of the human and how might we accomplish
this task through the critical project of black studies? (Weheliye 2014:
3). This is the question that sits at the core of Weheliye's work,
"Habeas Viscus: Racializing Assemblages, Biolpolitics, and Black
Feminist Theories of the Human", and drives the depth and nuance of his
engagements with theorizing the human. Weheliye points to the critical
ways in which the [human of modern western nations (read classically as
[Man]{.mark}) has always been [imbued in]{.mark} the ongoing [violence
of individuation]{.mark} [yielding]{.mark} a highly particularized and
[operationalized human.]{.mark} Pointing to the central role of
[racialization in shaping such particularities]{.mark}]{.underline},
Weheliye writes: Overall I construe [[race, racialization, and racial
identities as ongoing sets of political relations]{.underline}]{.mark}
that 62 Romi Ron Morrison • Gaps between the digits idj 25(1), 2019,
56--70 [require, through [constant perpetuation via institutions,
discourses, practices, desires, infrastructures, languages,
technologies, sciences, economics, dreams, and cultural
artifacts]{.mark}, the baring of nonwhite subjects from the category of
the human as it is [performed in the]{.mark} modern
[west]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Weheliye 2014: 3). In this quote Weheliye
complements Terry and Urla's work on the body by arguing [that "human"
has never been a neutral or axiomatic category, but instead it has
always been ensnared by, and [articulated]{.mark} [through]{.mark} the
powers of [discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Building on the work
of black feminists Sylvia Wynter and Hortense Spillers, Weheliye is
deliberate in his use of racialization noting that the racializing and
fixing of blackness as aberrant and non-normative is never free from its
correlative gender and sexual constitutions. Put simply, it is through
the [process of racialization that blackness, gender, and sexuality are
contained within a field of relational deviance, not able to be parsed
or neatly separated, i.e. racialized gender]{.underline}. [Racialization
and its corresponding depravation of gender and sexuality discipline
humanity into categories of full humans, not-quite-humans, and
non-humans]{.underline}. [Understanding the central necessity of
racialization to birth the containment of the human as cis white
straight able bodied and male, black feminist studies become uniquely
positioned as a "substantial critique of western modernity and a
sizeable archive of social, political, and cultural
alternatives]{.underline}" (Weheliye 2014: 3). For Weheliye, black
studies operate as a particular mode of [knowledge
production]{.underline}, carefully distinguishing between what Spillers
calls "real objects" and "[objects of knowledge]{.underline}" (Spillers
1994: 65). According to Spillers, the crisis within black studies lies
in its misreading as theorizing from the radical particularity of
blackness. Spillers works to disambiguate the real object, that which is
naturalized, from objects of knowledge, those which are formed through
the complex interplay among institutions, politics, violence,
discourses, practices, and economics. In this postulation, black people
are not the real objects of black studies, rather blackness as the
outcome of racialization becomes an object of knowledge. To misread
black people as the real objects of black studies naturalizes race as a
modality of either biology or culture, and elides the false universalism
of Man by which black people become nonhuman. If the human becomes an
object of knowledge within black studies, it can no longer be relegated
to the particularism of black bodies. Instead, this positions race as a
general theory and critique of western modernity and its divisive
enshrining of humanity, by which to discipline others is seen as unfit.
Put simply by Weheliye when evoking Wynter, "Our issue is not the issue
of race, our issue is the issue of the genre of Man. It is the issue of
Man that causes all the -isms." (Wynter 1999). Consistent with the
larger work of black feminist epistemology, Wynter and Spillers
understand that the foundation for the critique of Man cannot be
isolated into a single form of subjection (black or female), but must
point to complex interlocking oppressions that uphold the problematic
equating of Man to humanity. Making clear the centrality of their
arguments to his insistence on black studies, Weheliye writes: For
Wynter, a feminism that does not aspire to create a different code for
what it means to be human merely sketches a different map of Man's
territorializing assemblages; however in order to abolish these
assemblages feminism's insurrection must sabotage its own prescribed
role in the empirical articulation of its representations in effect by
coming out of the closet, moving out of our assigned categories
(Weheliye 2014: 27). This passage calls for a reformulation of the
category of human. For Wynter, however, it is not enough to carve out a
new space within the category of Man, and 63 Romi Ron Morrison • Gaps
between the digits idj 25(1), 2019, 56--70 h digital rights, legal
recourse, and regulation. Yet, despite such concerns and gaps in
governing protocol, the deployment of such technical applications are
growing in both their ubiquity and authority as adjudicating bodies over
the quality of lives lived and the authoring of space (AI Now Institute
2018). Understandably so, this asymmetry has sparked outcry and
coordinated pushes for legal protection and regulation. These responses
are essential first steps in curtailing the power of algorithms and the
increasingly concentrated corporate entities that own their intellectual
property. However, I want to turn my attention to the longue durée of
considering how such applications embodied by the HUMAN project work to
actively define and enclose particular understandings of the human
entrenched in social antagonisms of race, gender, and sexuality. To give
credence to the magnitude of its claims to quantify the human condition
as a whole, measurability becomes the single most important factor of
being human according to The HUMAN Project. Because [quantifiable data
collection is the primary methodology used by the project, it is
dependent on creating indicators and proxies that are numerical.
Therefore researchers are concerned only with the aspects of human
nature that they can count and process. Within the [processing of
information extracted from the point of the body,]{.mark} there is an
eerily [reminiscent]{.mark} parallel [with]{.mark} the ways that
**Spillers** theorizes the [making of the flesh]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
[the [essentializing of blackness to the slave subject]{.mark},
[stripped of any agency]{.mark} even over one's body, the [flesh must be
extracted from the body as a continuous raw material to be mined and
made fungibl]{.mark}e.]{.underline} While it is crucial to note that the
body becomes somewhat immaterial in this context, the [violence that
gives shape to the flesh are wholly material and unrelenting in their
exactness.]{.underline} However, in the [articulations of the human
crystalized]{.underline} but certainly not originated [by
the]{.underline} HUMAN [project]{.underline}, the materiality of the
body as a contained vessel of self-determination under Western liberal
subjectivity is challenged. Increasingly[, [the body]{.mark} (assumed as
human) [becomes a fungible site]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the enclosing and
[extracting]{.mark} of [information,]{.mark} paramount as a chief
commodity within late global capitalism]{.underline}. The promotional
materials of the HUMAN project consistently use collective [pronouns
such [as "us" and "we]{.mark}", often to [describe]{.mark} the vision of
the [project]{.mark} [as]{.mark} one that is
[communal]{.mark},]{.underline} and an affront to more corporatized
forms of data extraction and brokering. Project Director, Paul Glimcher
says: The Kavli HUMAN project offers each of us this challenge, take
your data back. Instead of giving our data to corporations let's bring
our data together as a community. Let's use that data not to sell things
but to make a better world (The Human Project 2017). Glimcher mildly
attempts to distinguish the intentions of the project as being different
from those of corporate interest in reductively stating that the data is
to be used to make a better world, not sell things. However, the
qualifying and grounding of such a world rarely materializes. Instead,
such opacity masks a utilitarian belief that if enough data is collected
and correlated the need for analysis becomes defunct (Mattern 2018). It
is [this [intended]{.mark} [opacity of a better benign world that
constantly drives the extractive ethos of capitalism, collection at all
costs, at]{.mark} the [promise o]{.mark}f large scale
s[olutionism]{.mark} from ending poverty to combating climate change.
This belief [in]{.mark} the **[techno utopian extends a docile
participation of willing subjects by dislocating the purported benefits
into an uncharted time and place of the future, looming on the horizon
but always conveniently out of reach]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[**Weheliye's**]{.underline} recalling of the assemblage via Deleuze and
Guattari serves as a helpful framework for untangling some of the
transversal nature of agency, bodies, and extraction mentioned
previously. In the tradition of Deleuze and Guattari, assemblage has
come to denote, 65 Romi Ron Morrison • Gaps between the digits idj
25(1), 2019, 56--70 "continuously shifting relational totalities
comprised of spasmodic networks between different entities (content) and
their articulation within "acts and statement" (expression)" (Weheliye
2014: 46). Following Weheliye's emphasis on racialization as a primary
assemblage through which the modern western human is crafted, I want to
stretch Deleuze and Guattari's concept of the assemblage to better
understand how the atomizing of the body into data is indeed a process
of racialization[. In [parallel]{.mark} [to]{.mark} early forms of
[scientific racism]{.mark} and the markings of race on the body, the
quantified self takes what is assumably stable, discrete, and apparent,
and crafts qualifications that are fixed to such markers. From this
position the logic is to assume what is, rather than ask how things come
to be or are in a state of becoming]{.underline}. Following the
investigative reporting of ProPublic in their series "Machine Bias",
researchers found grave [**racial imbalances in the algorithms used to
predict future criminality and allocate criminal sentences**. According
to researchers, on average scores of risk were skewed higher for black
defendants than for white defendants. The reason they give is that other
indicators such as credit score, income, residential zip code, level of
education, and other factors can yield compounded risk and longer
sentences for black defendants regardless of whether or not they are
first time or repeat offenders]{.underline} (Angwin et al. 2016). [The
logic of the [algorithm assumes these indicators as real objects]{.mark}
rather than objects of knowledge and is then [incapable of understanding
how systemic racism can itself color the data]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
work of numerous critical race theorists, sociologists, and historians
have been crucial in showing the ways that [laws, urban policies, social
attitudes, media, values, and institutions have shaped uneven life
chances for racialized people made legible in the same indicators of
credit score, income, zip code, and level of education]{.underline}
(Oliver & Shapiro 1995; Rothstein 2017). While it is the history of
systemic racism [operationalized largely through institutions and law
that yields such unfavorable conditions, these disparities are affixed
to the individual as indicative of that individual's future criminality.
Through this assemblage of representing the self by its direct and
relative coding in data, such algorithmic processing is essentialist in
its racializing of the data generated from the body that then directs
outcomes and possibilities for the body it has virtually come to
represent.]{.underline} Here, Denis Cosgrove's words regarding truth,
representation, and virtuality become hauntingly clear. [This **[process
of generating racially marked data from the body to determine future
outcome]{.mark}s** aligns with what Spillers calls the ["hieroglyphics
of the flesh]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Spillers 1987). [The hieroglyphics
of the flesh represent the continuing ways in which the [flesh]{.mark}
becomes [affixed to]{.mark} various [semiotics of deviance, threat,
risk, and aberration]{.mark}. In short, it is the [**making of blackness
as the slave**.]{.mark} Spillers is careful to note that the enslaved
black, captive flesh, is never freed from these markings but that they
continue as a constantly emergent semiotic both consciously and
unconsciously recognized]{.underline}. Similarly, [data, representative
of the racial fixing of risk and abjection, are affixed to and
simultaneously become representative of the body under the provocation
of the HUMAN project. What parity then can be found in the decision
making of the machine when dependent on privileging data as
self-evident, eliding how it comes to be?]{.underline}

http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1435/2/addressing-shortcomings-in-afro-pessimism//vi

While the [ontological state of Black social death is an important
concept for resistance scholars to understand]{.underline}, the
[[typical advocacy of **complete** societal pessimism]{.mark} in
response to that ontological arrangement **[is incomplete at
best]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Many in Afro-Pessimism use the basis of
social death to determine the question of Black political orientation in
a way that is problematic. [This is not to say that social death
theorization is not important, but that [there is a vital
distinction]{.mark} that needs to be made [both in terms of]{.mark} its
[application toward]{.mark} traditional [political]{.mark} processes and
ensembles of Blackness.]{.underline} Frank Wilderson, Associated
Professor of African-American Studies and Drama at the University of
California-Irvine, is quite possibly the leading Afro-Pessimist scholar.
He concludes his discussion of social death by advocating for one to
"embrace its disorder, its incoherence, and allow oneself to be
elabo­rated by it if, indeed, ones politics are to be underwritten by a
desire to take down this country" (2007). In summary, his application of
social death is used as a reason why Black life cannot be oriented at
any level of meaningful production within society[. While
[Wilderson]{.mark} is correct that the material labor and symbolic
currency born out of Blackness will always be consumed by whiteness,
[his conclusion is **paradoxical**]{.mark} at some level. **[If humanism
is the grammar by which civil society determines the register of
subjectivity, why then is that matrix appropriate in determining the
state of Black life]{.mark}**, if Black life is inherently the position
of what is incommunicable? If social death theory's application is one
that concludes an impossibility of meaningful Black productivity, then
Afro-Pessimism becomes nothing but a body of literature that echoes the
same sentiments as those who would understand Black life as a state of
nothingness]{.underline} in plain racist terms[. Understanding [Black
ontology should]{.mark} definitely involve an understanding of the
social deadness of the Black subject in relation to society, but it
should n**[ot be used as the standard to measure internal
liberation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [distinction here is important
because too often Afro-Pessimists scholars like Wilderson conceptualize
Black resistance as a singular orientation toward society]{.underline}.
Indeed their work is important to understand the manner in which society
operates upon Black subjects, but [[it is insufficient to
describe]{.mark} an ethic that allows for the **[pursuit of meaning
within Blackness itself]{.mark}**. In this regard, scholars should
understand [Black resistance]{.mark} as [occurring on two different
levels]{.mark}: the **[ontological and the
intra-ontological]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The [[distinction]{.mark}
being made [is]{.mark} between the [ontological state of Blackness
as]{.mark} determined **[outside of humanity proper versus]{.mark}** the
l[ife within the ontological state of **Blackness as understood through
social death.**]{.mark}]{.underline} If social death is the state of the
Black, what then speaks to the state of the Black amongst Blacks? It
would be a mistake on the part of any scholar to concern themselves with
one and not the other. This paper uses the term intra-ontology in
reference to the varying ontologies within social death. This is the
Black among Blacks. These are those spaces within Blackness that only
the Black can ever understand or occupy. [Though they exist outside of
the production of the human (within the category of social death), there
are Black affektual politics]{.underline} that have been with the slave
since the ship. These are [the emotional and spiritual ontologies within
Blackness that connected slaves of different lands, languages, and
religions into one community]{.underline}. Black intra-ontology can
never achieve the plane of recognition because it can only be understood
within Blackness, which by definition is the position of social death,
but those affektual spirits and emotions ought not be neglected.
[[Social death]{.mark} should guide Black resistance strategy in
understanding the position of the Black within civil society, but it
**[speaks not to the arrangement of Black intra-ontological
questions.]{.mark}** If this is measured by social death it only
produces a cycle of endless internal psychic violence because the Black
would only be met with the discovery of a violent reality of its
existence through affirmations of social death. Intra-ontological
resistance must not be a question of how the world understands
Blackness, because the position of the slave is one that cannot be
articulated in terms of hegemony.]{.underline} If it is so that the
Black inherently experiences the world through a different ontological
register, [then measures of Black liberation cannot be articulated
through the lens of humanist grammars.]{.underline} Jared Sexton, the
Director of the African-American Studies School of Humanities at the
University of California-Irvine, is another leading scholar in
Afro-pessimism. He explains that there is indeed social life that exists
within social death. There are many that condemn the invocation of
social death as overly pessimistic, but "this acceptance or affirmation
is active; it is a willing or willingness, in other words, to pay
whatever social costs accrue to being black, to inhabiting blackness, to
living a black social life under the shadow of social death. This is not
an accommodation to the dictates of the antiblack world" (Sexton 2010).
This is [to say that it is indeed possible to both affirm the state of
social death and actively pursue the social life that exists within
Blackness]{.underline}. This is not the typical critique of social
death, but rather it is a necessary specification of the social life
within social death that Sexton speaks. Social death is adequate in
terms of measuring the ontological state of the human versus the Black,
but a [different rubric is required in mapping social life within social
death.]{.underline} One such rubric is fleshly politics. This concepts
derives from the plantation in regards to the manner in which slaves
would temporarily reclaim and weaponize their bodies as a site of
political protest against their state of enslavement. Fleshy politics is
an example of an appropriate rubric for measuring liberation within
intra-ontological politics because these bodily resistances surely did
not change the physical state of enslavement, but it did immeasurable
good for the mental and psychological state of those in the master's
cage. Alternate orientations to the flesh "excavates the social
(after)life of these categories: it represents racializing assemblages
of subjection that can never annihilate the lines of flight, freedom
dreams, practices of liberation, and possibilities of other worlds"
(Weheliye 2014). In contrast to Wilderson's line of flight away from
bodily coding, it is important to reclaim the atrocity of the flesh as a
means of agency within capture through the remapping of whiteness. The
enslaved female flesh was the site of great violence, but there is a
false "dichotomy between the material/political and the personal, in
large measure \[because even though the\] body, so deeply personal, is
also a political arena. Their work has demonstrated the extent to which
women\'s bodies were unique sites of domination under slavery" (Camp
2002). Though the body was in the possession of the slave master, the
enslaved found personal meaning in its temporary recapture in
fleshliness which satisfied an innate desire for selfhood. The
illegality of using the flesh as a site of pleasure became a political
counter-investment. While conventional Afro-Pessimist would argue that
this personal orientation does nothing in terms of the ontological
position within Blackness, the personal victory the enslaved experiences
as a result of that temporary reclamation is meaningful in both
psychological and emotional terms. [This is important because if there
is never room for personal liberation, and Black resistance is only
understood in terms of material questions within civil society, it
reproduces the same sacrificial logic that social death explains.
Resistance strategies that only take meaning in notions of full agency
are recipes for failure because these only measure Black liberation on
the register of civil society which can never grapple with the inherent
confine in which Black life exists]{.underline}. Balancing Ontological
versus Intra-Ontological To take the conclusion of the previous section
and use the call from intra-ontological liberation as a justification
for the ontological state of Blackness would be a violent imposition of
whiteness. [The arrangement of Blackness as an ontological question
versus Blackness as an intra-ontological question is a criminalization
of Black thought. The two are not mutually exclusive, nor should one be
viewed as a sufficient substitute for the other. Instead, they are
complimentary; they are necessary components to the assemblage of Black
resistance strategy.]{.underline} for free political autonomy absent
British restrictions, there is also a less told narrative. Early desires
for Manifest Destiny began not with the Constitution of the United
States but with the pressures of the early American state to explore
Native lands out West in order to take those lands as their own. They
felt as though limiting themselves to the eastern shores deprived them
of a natural right to own territory occupied by the Natives, and when
the British government denied these desires for further colonial
expansionism, it fuelled war tensions (James 2007). This trend is also
true for slavery, and the American Civil War is an example. The
maintenance of Slavery played a pivotal role in fuelling the American
Civil War. Southern States wanted to continue the institution of slavery
in new states admitted into the Union, and when this was denied, it
fuelled the outbreak of the Civil War. These desires for empire not only
created America, but they also sustained it through more war. This is
why there exists an antagonistic relationship between the slave and
civil society. The Black relationship to the United States, and really
western civil society writ large, has always been one defined through
violent terms. The very being of the Black comes to be in the world
through the active colonial murder of the African. Often it is forgotten
that Black itself is not an identity that it denoted by a specific
topography or practice, but rather it is known through constructionist
conceptions that are projected upon, and not by it. The case is a simple
one; "Give Turtle Island back to the \"Savage." Give life itself back to
the Slave. Two simple sentences, fourteen simple words, and the
structure of U.S. (and perhaps global) antagonisms would be dismantled"
(Wilderson 2010). Slavery provided not only the economic means for which
the United States to produce itself, but it provided the map by which it
could exist culturally and socially as well. If the United States was
founded upon the genocide of the indigenous and the death of the
African, then how can it ever be an ethical entity? It is not, and it
should not be the end-point of Black political emancipation. Black
movements in particular should abandon the United States as a source of
hope because of the antagonistic relationship that it has with civil
society. In terms ontological positioning, the ultimate point of freedom
for the Black subject is the disorganization of society's operation upon
Black flesh because "for Black people, civil society itself- rather than
its abuses or shortcomings - is a state of emergency" (Wilderson 2003).
The power dynamic in the status quo exists as such through the
continuous destructive consumption of the Black. Obviously, chattel
slavery has ended but the slave relationship the Black has with the
United States, and the world as a whole, is unchanged. In every major
institution, Black bodies experience oppression and inequality at a
systemic level. From ailing educational structures in overly
impoverished neighborhoods, to the state of mass incarceration, Black
subjects in America are targeted and subjected to overwhelming
discrimination and abuse in every field. This is no coincidence. Recent
theorizations have even gone as far as to identify the state of mass
incarceration as the newest era of Black enslavement. Though not on the
plantation, there is a case to be made that the slavery now exists in
"the mass incarceration of people of color. Although African American
men comprise less than seven percent of the population, they comprise
half of the prison and jail population. Today, one out of three African
American men is either in prison, on probation, or on parole" (Alexander
2006). This pattern of surveillance, restriction, and destruction of
Black bodies is the very same process of enslavement from the
plantation. This has been and continues to be the truth of Black life in
western civilization since the dawning of the Middle Passage. Now, there
are a myriad of liberal scholars who will point to sentimental hollow
policies such as the Civil Rights Act to make the case for why the state
of Black oppression is getting better. While the form of Black slavery
has definitely changed and become more nuanced in its application, the
foundational truth of said slavery remains unchanged. The question
remains of how to create consistency in ontological and
intra-ontological resistance. [Is it materially possible to both call
for a disruption of civil society while finding points of productivity
in society? The answer is yes, at the margins.]{.underline} It is here
that this paper makes another substantive departure from conventional
pessimistic theorization, and again, it is useful to refer to
Wilderson's work. His theorization of the Black's antagonistic
relationship with the world concludes that the world is parasitic on
Black life. Thus, he forwards the end of the world as the only ethical
alternative. Afro-Pessimists are often criticized for their highly
theoretical abstraction with this concept. Though there are no explicit
specifications of what the end of the world is or how Black resistance
movements are to specifically get there, it is widely accepted that the
position is more of an epistemic orientation rather than one that
forwards literal destruction. In addition, Wilderson calls for Black
refusal to engage in civil society in an unflinching paradigmatic
analysis meaning that any form of engagement with civil society would
require Black abjection. This is the point of friction that this paper
seeks to address. [Even though Black bodies stand in an antagonistic
relationship to the world, there needs to be a distinction made. The
notion that any level of stability within civil society affirms Black
Death has two major problems. First, it produces the exact same pattern
of ressentiment which reproduces the internalization of self-hate which
only sets the stage for communal violence in an attempt to cleanse. If
the standard for measuring the effectiveness of Black movements is the
destruction of every part of society, then failure is the only
appropriate descriptor for every Black resistance strategy in history.
If this is the case, the internalization of Black slaveness becomes all
but inevitable by reinforcing psychological, mental, and emotional
chains of depression on all those who seek to resistance. The second
problem is that Black bodies have no means of creating instability at
the state or societal level. Society is a manifestation of hundreds of
years of economic and political accumulation that has yielded countless
weapons against the oppressed.]{.underline} [Simply expecting the
dominant order to forgo the use of those weapons is a fantasy. The scope
of orienting towards the end of the world in terms of instability is far
too large. The end of the world is not possible. Afro-Pessimism is far
too separated from the material practice of resistance in this
regard.]{.underline} If the justification for detaching from state
involvement is that it requires a sacrificing of Black flesh, then
resistance strategies must consider the effect of a complete embrace of
political refusal. Calls for absolute Black pessimism is also an
abjection of Black flesh in the same manner Wilderson bases the need for
the end of the world because an open refusal and rejection to at least
seemingly conform to degrees of social norms will have deadly
consequences for Black bodies. For pessimists to call for Blacks to
openly embrace physical death in pursuit of theory is irresponsible and
unethical. [Wilderson uses the question of flinching as a misnomer. The
term seems to suggest that any participation in or any implicit
affirmation of society is an insufficient Black politic]{.underline}.
The problem is that at its core the very nature of Black life is one
that requires a series of strategic and tactical flinches. This means
that in different situations and settings, Black bodies take different
forms. [If confronted on the street by a racist police officer, asking
for one to unconditionally refuse to recognize the position of the
officer is in turn asking for Black suicidal politics.]{.underline} As
posited above, there is something inherently valuable within Black
intra-ontological arrangements, and as such, suicide is a non-starter.
Not only is this a strategy for sustaining intra-ontological freedom,
[but it is also a strategy for pursuing the disorganization of civil
society. It problematizes society's ability to easily script the nature
of Black life and Black resistance. Tactical flinches allow Blackness to
become a thousand different villains disguised as citizens. It is a
protective mechanism for those who seek to fight against tyranny without
inciting the wrath of the tyrannical. This is not to say that Black
resistance should ever flinch in its orientation to civil society at a
fundamental level. It is to say that in order for Black life to exist in
a world that wishes its death, it is necessary to disguise that
orientation and strategically present it in certain settings. Some will
be highly critical of this notion because it will be perceived as a call
to sacrifice expressions of authentic self in an appeasement of the
dominant order. Instead, this is a call to reassess the very
understanding of political orientation. Black resistance should embody
refusal at the core level; that should be internalized, and it is the
very process of mystifying that core refusal in acts of fugitive
transgressions against civil society that renders its violence
inoperable.]{.underline} This is not a sacrifice of the authentic self,
but the mystification and protection of authentic Blackness in an act of
rebellion against societal production of anti-Black violence. This is an
effective means of navigating Black ontological questions. Again, Black
liberation cannot be measured in terms of the absence of white violence,
but it must be measured using different rubrics. In terms of Black
ontological resistance as an ensemble, this resistance is a question is
the maintenance of Black communities through the inoperability of
violence by complicating perceptions of Black criminality. Since the
slave has no capacity to orchestrate the manifestation of the end of the
world, then Black orientation to the end of the world must begin with
one of constructing the illegality of the body. This is the means in
which Black movements must employ fleshly politics in modern resistance
strategies. [The end of the world should not be understood through the
instability of civil society or the state, but rather, it should be
understood through the ability of Black communities to render themselves
self-sufficient which should very well include a strategic and criminal
relationship with civil society.]{.underline}

#### Afropess is too totalizing theory of power \-- it doesn't account for individual experiences 

**DAWSON 21** - Michael C. Dawson is the John D. MacArthur Professor of
Political Science at the University of Chicago, and founding director of
its Center for the Study of Race, Politics, and Culture, 5-17-2021,
\"Against Afropessimism,\" IDEOLOGY THEORY PRACTICE,
https://www.ideology-theory-practice.org/blog/against-afropessimism//vi

Afropessimists argue that we can only understand the global system of
racial domination if we acknowledge that it is, first and foremost, a
system defined in toto by anti-blackness. Moreover, Afropessimism
rejects a central role for political economy and politics for
understanding the essence of black oppression. For the past few years,
this branch of critical race theory has gained a number of supporters in
and out of the academy. For example, Frank Wilderson's highly
influential 2020 book Afropessimism was long-listed for the National
Book Award and was praised by several outstanding black intellectuals.
This essay centres the work of Frank Wilderson and Jared Sexton as they
are widely recognised leaders of the Afropessimism school of
thought.\[1\] Wilderson and Sexton claim that the enslavement of
Africans constituted a rupture; a rupture that was essential for the
development of capitalism but also a rupture that put black bodies and
black people outside of the logics of capitalism and colonialism. For
Sexton and Wilderson, anti-blackness is both a unique system of
structural dominance as well as an ideology. Anti-blackness, they claim,
is defined by racial slavery and impervious to change. Sexton argues for
example, "the application of the law of racial slavery is pervasive,
regardless of variance or permutation in its operation across the better
part of a millennium".\[2\] In this essay, I offer a critique of
Afropessimism, both as a theory of black oppression and as a political
project. I make the following claims. [First, [Afropessimism incorrectly
centres]{.mark} the [experiences of people]{.mark} of African descent
that were **[enslaved within the U.S.]{.mark}** This **[results in the
homogenisation of the experiences]{.mark}** of peoples of African
descent]{.underline}, and, equally importantly, mischaracterises and
belittles the oppression of non-African colonised subjects. [While I
agree that anti-blackness is a central structural feature of global
white supremacy that emerged with the mid-15th-century Iberian slave
trade, I argue that it is not the only critical structural feature that
historically defined white supremacy.]{.underline} Further, the
ontological centring of the experiences of people of African descent in
the U.S. radically and incorrectly homogenises the history and
conditions of the peoples of Africa and those in the African Diaspora.
Secondly, I argue that Afropessimists overemphasise the continuities in
the black experience in the U.S. While Afropessimists are correct that
there are structural continuities across time that continue to
contribute to black oppression---not the least of which is a continuing
vitriolic and violent global anti-blackness---they underemphasise the
achievements of black freedom struggles. [Even [Wilderson's own
biography]{.mark} is a [testimony to]{.mark} critical changes in the
black experience in the U.S. The **[positive changes]{.mark}** that are
elided in the work of many Afropessimists---such as [the formation
of]{.mark} modern **[black civil society]{.mark}** and a great
[expansion of]{.mark} a robust and often [revolutionary black
politics--- serves to **erase**]{.mark} the often [heroic struggles of
black activists]{.mark}; struggles that often tragically failed to bring
substantial progress, but that also sometimes achieved victories in the
struggle for black liberation. Finally, and [critically, Wilderson and
Sexton present]{.mark} a fatally [flawed account of]{.mark} the
**[relationship between black oppression, white supremacy]{.mark}** and
the capitalist social order.]{.underline} I will demonstrate that this
is a flaw that not only makes impossible any accurate account of black
oppression, but also prevents us from understanding the contradictions
and cleavages that exist within black communities and black politics.
[Afropessimism Incorrectly Centres the Experiences of People of African
Descent Enslaved within the U.S. Afro-Pessimists homogenise the black
experience. I]{.underline} agree with Wilderson when he argues that the
enslavement of blacks, and specifically the slave trade, was a condition
for the development of global capitalism, particularly as the Atlantic
became more economically important than the Mediterranean.\[3\] The
large-scale sale of Africans in 1444 by the Portuguese marked Africans
as the Other, justifying in the minds of royal, religious, and secular
Portuguese elites the brutal and exceptional enslavement of Africans.
Previously, only prisoners of war were subject to enslavement. This
marked the moment when Africans were marked as the exception to natural
law in service of accumulation; in service of profits.\[4\] I also agree
with Wilderson that this marks the inception of a set of anti-black
logics that have taken a life of their own and have rendered black lives
less valuable, subject to excessive and often arbitrary violence, and
ultimately disposable during the entire history of capitalist
development. I disagree, however, when Sexton and Wilderson privilege
the role of enslaved Africans and their descendants in the "New World"
and homogenise the black experience. They fail to understand that black
people have played a number of roles viz colonialism and have been
valued differently by capitalist states and managers depending on those
roles.\[5\] Sexton's claim "\[t\]he United States provides the point of
focus here, but the dynamics under examination are not restricted to its
bounds" glosses over the differences in black experience at the time of
slavery and the present day, and between "New World slavery" and
old-world colonialism.\[6\] It assumes that the figure of the enslaved
African in the "New World" can represent the entirety of black
experience. This is untenable: After all, one might well argue that the
experience of colonised Africans was more akin to that of the other
colonised populations of Asia and the "New World" than that of their
enslaved cousins. The work of scholars such as Michael Ralph and Andrew
Zimmerman, among many others, demonstrate that those enslaved in the so-
called "New World" was not the same, for example, as the experience of
Africans in Senegambia who worked as agents on behalf of European
colonial powers.\[7\] Further, these Afropessimists incorrectly belittle
the oppression of non-white peoples who are not of African descent. If
the threat and shadow of slavery followed those of African descent
across generations, the very real threat of dispossession, massacre and
even genocide at the hands of Euro-American imperialists and their
clients similarly hung over entire indigenous populations across
multiple continents and islands. But Afropessimists deny this. Sexton,
for example, argues that with respect to black folks, indigenous
populations had the same relationship to people of African descent as
the Europeans that colonised the western hemisphere, Asia, and Africa.
Sexton argues, "freedom from the rule of slave law requires only that
one be considered nonblack, whether that nonblack racial designation be
"white" or "Indian" or, in the rare case, "Oriental"---this despite the
fact that each of these groups has at one point or another laboured in
conditions similar to or contiguous with enslaved African-derived
groups."\[8\] In other words, Sexton here argues that modern racial
slavery was so momentous than even the indigenous victims of genocide,
or the conquered colonised peoples throughout the world, had more in
common with whites than they had in common with enslaved African
populations and their descendants---even though arguably colonised
Africans had more in common with other colonised peoples than with their
enslaved cousins in the Western Hemisphere. Sexton declares, "we note
the fact that 'the absolute submission mandated by law was not simply
that of slave to his or her owner- but the submission of all the
enslaved before all whites. The latter group is better termed all non
blacks (or, less economically, the unequally arrayed category of
non-blackness), because it is racial blackness as a necessary condition
for enslavement that matters most, rather than whiteness as a condition
for freedom."\[9\] Even bracketing the historical inaccuracies, the
logical and temporal slippage in the above passages that lead to the
transformation from "enslaved before all whites" to "better termed non
blacks" is stunning. The genocide of indigenous peoples in the New World
preceded black slavery and was in many ways as or more brutal even if
the dehumanisation processes markedly differed. Nine out of ten
indigenous people died due to European diseases in the New World---yet
that category was a condition for freedom? The American empire as well
as that of its European counterparts required periodic massacres of
racialised "natives" at places such as Sand Creek and Wounded Knee, or
in the early 20th century, the Philippines where an extraordinary
percentage of the population was killed during the American military
intervention before World War I. In his work on racialised U.S.
imperialism in the Philippines, Kramer calls estimates of 250,00
Filipinos dying as a result of U.S. military intervention during the
late 19th early 20th century "conservative".\[10\] Massacres such as
these were conducted by from Southern to Northern African by brutal
imperialists such as the Germans and British. To sum up: White supremacy
was and is a global imperial project that divided the world into
civilised, human, citizen-subjects, and non-civilised, sub-human
colonised subjects. The enslavement of Africans and the centrality of
the slave trade for the early development of capitalism and empire for
Atlantic sector European states ensured that anti-blackness would be an
enduring structural feature of white supremacy. But the processes of
racialisation, domination, dispossession and exploitation associated
with white supremacy differed within and across regions. Only by not
homogenising the experiences of the various racially subordinated
populations---including the experiences of people of African
descent---will we be able to analytically forge theories and practices
needed for black liberation. Afropessimism is Anti-Political and Erases
the History and Achievements of Black Liberation Movements. Wilderson
argues that blacks are not of the world, they are also not part of the
"narrative," not part of history. Wilderson states: "As provocative as
it may sound history and redemption (and therefore narrative itself) are
inherently anti-Black."\[11\] For Wilderson, blacks are outside of
history; "space and time" are absent: "just as there is no time for the
Slave, there is also no place for the Slave."\[12\] In asserting that
black people are outside of history, Wilderson is making the claim that
Blackness is irrevocably marked as slaveness---there is no historical
change in the meaning of blackness and position of black people. In
Afropessimism, for example, Wilderson claims that "Afropessimism is
premised on an iconoclastic claim: that Blackness is coterminous with
Slaveness."\[13\] "Blackness," Wilderson emphasises, "cannot exist other
than Slaveness".\[14\] This is not so much an iconoclastic claim as a
false one. It is true, of course, that Black lives after slavery
continued to be marked by domination and violence. The spectre of
extreme violence aimed at individuals and black communities, the
expropriation that marked share cropping in the rural south, the
super-exploitation of black industrial workers, the precarious position
of black women performing paid and unpaid domestic labour, and the
continued vulnerability of black women to all of the above as well as
gender-based domination, all serve to emphasise the continuities of
domination. But while there were important continuities between in the
condition of black people during and after slavery, the rupture caused
by the end of slavery nonetheless represented a massive change in how
black life was organised---a reorganisation that transformed the
articulation between white supremacy and the capitalist social order.
The end of slavery presented new and important opportunities for black
agency even if full "freedom" was not achieved. It was marked by the
formation of black civil society, the emergence of new possibilities as
well as new challenges for black politics. It was during this period
that the institutional backbone of black civil society was
developed---including the black church (which was as much a political
institution as a sacred one); black institutions of higher learning;
cooperative and mutual aid societies; and. a myriad of other
organisational initiatives. All were launched and/or consolidated during
this period. The ability to form families, expand black politics, and
build black civil society represented a type of real if limited
progress. Further, Wilderson's claim that the black condition is defined
by "slaveness," that blacks are not of the world, they are also not part
of the "narrative," not part of history is also profoundly
anti-political. For Wilderson, blacks exist outside of the domain of
politics: "The violence of the slave estate cannot be thought of the way
one thinks of the violence of capitalist oppression. It takes an ocean
of violence to produce a slave, singular or plural, but that violence
never goes into remission. Again, the prehistory of violence that
establishes slavery is also the concurrent history of slavery[. This is
a difficult cognitive map for most activists to adjust to because it
actually takes the problem outside of politics."\[15\] Wrong. What
progress has been made has been the result of fighting through social
movements that, as Malcolm X urged, used any means necessary.
**[Fighting oppression is inherently political]{.mark}**. The
[anti-political nature of Wilderson's central claim casts aside]{.mark}
the momentous [struggles]{.mark} of black people [for liberation
in]{.mark} the U.S., massive struggles for freedom throughout **[the
African Diaspora]{.mark}**, the 20th-century African national liberation
struggles, as well as contemporary African struggles against
neocolonialism, neoliberal regimes, and against the new imperial project
of redividing Africa. Perhaps the most immoral implication of
Wilderson's claim that slaveness defines blackness is that the human is
defined against blackness.]{.underline} If blacks are not human then it
is easier to claim that black people are outside of history, and blacks
are outside the realm of politics. For Wilderson, all human life is
defined in opposition blackness, in opposition to the condition of being
a slave. Wilderson explains, "Human Life is dependent on Black death for
its existence and for its conceptual coherence. There is no world
without Blacks, yet there are no Blacks who are in the World."\[16\]
This claim places Wilderson outside of both the black radical and black
nationalist traditions. Black movements whether black liberal, black
Marxist, or black nationalist fought and died insisting on Africans'
humanity---although some, particularly but not exclusively many black
nationalists, questioned the humanity of those that enslaved others.
Black movements have historically, and correctly, demanded a place in a
world the recognition of one's own humanity regardless of one's status
as enslaved, expropriated, and oppressed. Afropessimism Distorts the
Relationship Between Anti-Blackness, White Supremacy, Patriarchy, and
Capitalism Finally and critically, this version of Afropessimism
severely mischaracterises the relationship between anti-blackness, white
supremacy, and capitalism.\[17\] [Wilderson asserts that political
economy is of little use for analysing the black condition as the
condition of the slave, the condition of blacks, is subject to violence
that cannot be explained by political economy.]{.underline} Further, the
status of the slave is invariant to "historical shifts[." I assert that
only by understanding the interaction between the multiple systems of
domination blacks are subject to---white supremacy (of which
anti-blackness is a central structural feature), patriarchy and
capitalism---will we be able to understand for any given era the status
of blacks; the massive and multiple forms of violence that blacks
experience, and the way forward toward full black
liberation.]{.underline} In Afropessimism, Wilderson only briefly
considers the role of political economy in black subjugation. He argues
that the use/study of political economy cannot explain the violence
committed against blacks. This violence, Wilderson argues, is invariant
across time. Specifically: "Black people exist in the throes of what
historian David Eltis calls 'violence beyond the limit,' by which he
means: (a) in the libidinal economy there are no forms of violence so
excessive that they would be considered too cruel to inflict upon
Blacks; and (b) in political economy there are no rational explanations
for this limitless theatre of cruelty, no explanations that would make
political or economic sense of the violence that positions and punishes
Blackness....the Slave's relationship to violence is
open-ended...unaccountable to historical shifts."\[18\] What Wilderson
misses is that blacks are subject to multiple sources of violence---the
cumulative nature of which is monstrous. [Simultaneously analysing the
articulation of white supremacy, patriarchy, and capitalism leads one to
the realisation that blacks depending on context in various combinations
experience violence as workers, women, and/or as black people. Each
system of domination routinely inflicts violence for those at the bottom
of each hierarchy]{.underline}. I would add that an aspect of white
supremacy and anti-blackness is that for blacks even the forms of
violence that derive from patriarchy and capitalism are intensified due
to white supremacy. This violence is also rational to the degree that
each form of violence is ultimately aimed at reinforcing the rule of
those at the top of each system of domination. In a much earlier essay,
Wilderson more directly addresses the relationship between capitalism
and black subjugation. Wilderson asserts that "...the United States is
constructed at the intersection of both a capitalist and white
supremacist matrix."\[19\] This statement is promising in that it hints
at the simultaneous analysis of the interaction between capitalism and
white supremacy. Yet, he does not sufficiently explore the consequences
of this statement and does not analyse the actual dynamics created by
the articulation of capitalism and white supremacy. For example, in
Afropessimism Wilderson correctly asserts that "....the emergence of the
slave, the subject-effect of an ensemble of direct relations of force
marks the emergence of the capitalism itself."\[20\] The "primitive"
accumulation necessary for the establishment of the capitalist social
order does have at its centre the brutal and hideous social relations of
slavery and the slave trade, but not only slavery.\[21\] But unlike what
Wilderson argues, the historical record shows that under white supremacy
and colonialism blacks are not the only racially subordinate group to be
subject to "direct relations of force." As Ince argues, "direct
relations of force" do not only mark the subject of the slave, but of
the colonised more generally such as the genocide of the indigenous
peoples of particularly the "New" World (itself a precondition of
capitalism).\[22\] Establishing and maintaining capitalism has required
the expropriation of resources and labour---simultaneously wedded to the
violation of black, brown, and yellow bodies throughout the world. In
the end, non-white bodies are disposable in the global North and South;
in the ghettoes, barrios, reservations, prisons, refugee camps and
immigration detention centres that can be grimly found throughout the
world. The particularities are important---and anti-blackness is a key
particularity that shapes capitalism and white supremacy, but as argued
earlier, it still a part a global system of white supremacy marked by
direct relations of force, and which non-whites are racialised
differently by that force. Within the context of the U.S., only a type
of stubborn blindness, a refusal to acknowledge the historical record,
and refusal to see the interrelationship between capitalism and racial
domination can lead those such as Wilderson to argue that "we were never
meant to be workers.....From the very beginning, we were meant to be
accumulated and die."\[23\] This assertion flies against the historical
evidence. No, blacks were meant to work, die, and be accumulated as need
be. White supremacy often demands that blacks die. Capitalism demands
that blacks must also, when necessary work and/or be accumulated. Each,
and patriarchy as well, continually make their bloody demands. Through
politics and other means of struggle blacks continually resist. This
resistance can only be successful by understanding the mutual
articulation between each system of domination. Conclusion: What is at
Stake? What is at stake is far more critical than an abstract academic
debate between theorists. These debates speak directly to how we
understand Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential elections and the
racist, authoritarian and potentially fascist phenomenon of "Trumpism"
and the rise of neo-fascist movements in the global north and south. It
speaks to how we best understand the accelerating rates of inequality in
both the global north and south popularly described by Thomas
Piketty.\[24\] It speaks to how we understand the rising wave of
violence that black folks face here, throughout the Diaspora, and within
Africa itself. Afropessimists have an ahistorical narrative that
distorts the relationship of white supremacy to capitalism---insisting
despite all historical and contemporary empirical evidence to the
contrary that the core logics of slave-based anti-blackness exists
outside of, and ultimately invariant to, the dynamics of the capitalist
political economy. This strand of theorising has taken root in
real-world activism---in this case among young black activists
struggling once again for black liberation. Afropessimism, however,
presents real political dangers for those organising for black
liberation. I will mention three such dangers here. By arguing that
black subjugation lies outside the realm of the political, Afropessimism
serves as a basis for political demobilisation rather than mobilisation.
Indeed, Wilderson is correct when he states, "This is a difficult
cognitive map for most activists to adjust to because it actually takes
the problem outside of politics."\[25\] Second, Afropessimism severely
undermines those attempting to build solidarity with other racially
subordinate groups. Do we still need to be building independent radical
black movements and organisations? Yes. Is building solidarity hard.
Yes. Is one likely to experience anti-black racism from some other
peoples of colour? Yes. Is it still a necessary task if meaningful
political victories are to be achieved? Yes. Third, by ignoring the
class and gender dynamics within black communities, Afropessimism makes
it far more difficult to understand the dynamics of intra-black
politics. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for fighting all forms
of oppression and domination that are experienced within black
communities. Afropessimists are correct to insist that the logics of
racial domination are autonomous and not fully determined by a
capitalist social order. Afropessimists fail to understand, however, the
effects of the interaction of multiple systems of domination have on
black life and politics. It is our task to forge better theoretical
weapons to not only illuminate the nature of oppressive systems of
domination, but also to provide effective tools to combat oppression.

We live in a time grappling with anti-black racism, in which the term
"anti-blackness" has become part of the public lexicon. Descriptively,
anti-blackness seems self-evident; however, the term's [relationship to
race and racism is undertheorized. We argue here that the recent
discourse of anti-blackness needs to be situated not as more than, or
beyond, race but in and as a racial discourse]{.underline}. The
emergence of "anti-blackness" as a concept is recent, dating back a
little more than a quarter of a century. The first substantive use of
the concept appears in Joseph R. Washington's (1984) Anti-Blackness in
English Religion to argue that anti-blackness (a negative attitude
towards all things black, dark, etc.) provided the basis for
anti-Blackness (anti-black racism). His account is largely
impressionistic and it does not systematically explain the
transformation of attitudes into racial/racist theories. Amiri Baraka,
in a 1987 article published in The Black Scholar, used the term to
denounce how White art reproduces racism in the process of incorporating
"Black images." Yet, [the use of "anti-blackness" in Baraka is
understated, and the conceptual apparatus pivots on other analytics such
as racism, imperialism, socialism, and self-determination.]{.underline}
By the 1990s, there emerged a clear conceptual discussion of
anti-blackness in Lewis Gordon's works within an existentialist and
phenomenological framework. For Gordon, the problematic was the
possibility of Black existence in a world predicated on denying the
validity of blackness. Yet, the operative term remains "antiblack
racism," i.e. the set of conditions and practices that seek to create
"an antiblack world." By the 2000s, the use of anti-blackness increases
exponentially with the appearance of self-styled "Afropessimist"
literature in the academy. Here, a discourse of anti-blackness begins to
emerge, with the term anti-blackness operating largely in rhetorical
mode (see for example Frank Wilderson's Bildungsroman narratives about
his emergence as the last political radical in a world of neoliberal
sell-outs). More recently, as Afropessimism has reached a broader
audience via social media and other online channels, anti-blackness has
assumed widespread currency in both the academic and popular presses.
Recent years have witnessed calls in the mainstream media for greater
attention to "anti-blackness" as opposed to "racism." Proponents of
anti-blackness have sought to distinguish the two concepts and have made
claims in the name of anti-racism that nevertheless critique its very
grounds. For example, in a widely circulated New York Times piece,
kihana miraya ross argues that, while "the word 'racism' is everywhere,"
it fails to capture just "what black people in this country are facing."
Rather than "racism," ross argues, "the right term is 'anti-blackness.'"
Anti-blackness, according to ross, describes "the kind of violence that
saturates black life" -- a violence that is "gratuitous and
unrelenting." According to ross, the term "racism" is not only too broad
(a "catch-all," as she calls it), it also fails to capture the
complexity of anti-blackness. Similarly, Ahmed Olayinka Sule's 2019
piece in The Guardian, argued that "it is an appropriate time for
anti-blackness to be classified separately from racism and given its own
prominence." [His argument against a "one-size-fits-all" approach to
anti-racist scholarship and organizing, like ross's piece, validates and
extends a discourse of anti-blackness that purports to be more specific
and more trenchant than other (though unnamed) critical theories of race
and racism. "In setting anti-blackness apart from and against theories
of race and racism, its proponents not only refuse to historicize their
concept, they also refuse to contextualize it in relation to and as a
racial discourse."]{.underline} It would be [wrong to understand
arguments like ross's and Sule's solely, or even primarily, as
clamorings for greater recognition of, and attention to, the
particularity and immediacy of anti-black racism. Rather, the authors
build on a subtle but troubling argument that positions anti-blackness
against racism and which has implications for evaluating each piece
(ross's and Sule's) as an anti-racist work. According to its proponents,
the durability of anti-blackness---its "relentlessness" to use ross's
term---is its defining characteristic and what distinguishes it as more
than another type of racism among racisms. Rather than contingent and
contestable, as critical theories of race and racism have emphasized,
anti-blackness endures. To again quote ross, anti-blackness is a
"structural reality" and is nothing if not deeply embedded.
Anti-blackness, then, significantly shifts the terms of racial
discourse. In contrast to critical theories of race and racism that have
emphasized contingency and historicity, anti-blackness asserts a
permanence that is theoretically explicated in Afropessimist literature.
Afropessimism locates the origins of anti-blackness in slavery and then
asserts its "relentlessness" and durability over time.]{.underline} As
ross's article from above states, Afropessimism "argues that
anti-blackness indexes the structural reality so that in the larger
society, blackness is inextricably tied to 'slaveness.' While the system
of U.S. chattel slavery technically ended 150 years ago, it continues to
mark the ontological position of black people." In Afropessimist
theorizations, slavery serves more as origin story than historical
contextualization. The connections between anti-blackness and slavery
are crystallized in Afropessimist writing and erected as a foundational
truth rather than emerging as an unstable, historical articulation. [The
shift that anti-blackness presents for thinking about race and racism is
made obscure precisely because it is the field of racial discourse that
new theorizations of anti-blackness disavow. Normatively, critical
theories of race and racism involve a certain epistemological and
political reflexivity towards racial discourse. This is because
theorists understand that their statements on race participate in
reproducing and potentially deepening racial conditions. By contrast,
proponents of anti-blackness have abjured this reflexivity. They
paradoxically deny the applicability of anti-blackness to the discursive
field it participates in.]{.underline} As ross writes, anti-blackness is
"more than just 'racism against black people.'" Instead, she asserts
that it is "a theoretical framework," or as Wilderson has claimed of
Afropessimism, it is a "metatheory." [In setting anti-blackness apart
from and against theories of race and racism, its proponents not only
refuse to historicize their concept, they also refuse to contextualize
it in relation to and as a racial discourse.]{.underline} This [double
elision explains why the shift in racial discourse that anti-blackness
presents has yet to register with many theorists of race, even as the
term has proliferated in and outside the academy.]{.underline} It is
important to recognize this shift and to note its implications for
racial theory and the praxis of antiracism. To conclude, [we want to
clarify the implications of the argument at hand and ask what it would
mean to situate anti-blackness not as more than, or beyond, race but in
and as racial discourse. In spite of claims to the contrary, what does a
reading of anti-blackness as racial discourse reveal?]{.underline} As a
racial discourse, anti-blackness becomes clearer when understood in the
postracial moment. [The postracial constitutes raciality anew by
paradoxically denying the salience of race and racism. Anti-blackness,
correspondingly, fixes racial meaning in the very moment it purports to
move beyond race. By refusing discursive and historical analysis in
favor of a theory of permanence or relentlessness, anti-blackness
obscures the instability of racial power and the ways racial meaning is
made and unmade in the postracial moment. What we have outlined here
suggests that the discourse of anti-blackness risks camouflaging
postraciality as anti-racist work.]{.underline} To the extent that
proponents of anti-blackness refuse to theorize the historical
particularity and relationality of race and racism, they reject the very
tools necessary to explain or combat the operation of the racial power
they diagnose.
