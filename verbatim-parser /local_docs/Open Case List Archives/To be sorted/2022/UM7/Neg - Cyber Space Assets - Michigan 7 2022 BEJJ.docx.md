24\. [We will expedite our digital transformation, adapt the NATO
Command Structure for the information age and enhance our cyber
defences]{.underline}, networks and infrastructure. We will promote
innovation and increase our investments in emerging and disruptive
technologies to retain our interoperability and military edge. [We will
work together to adopt and integrate new technologies,]{.underline}
cooperate with the private sector, protect our innovation ecosystems,
shape standards and commit to principles of responsible use that reflect
our democratic values and human rights.

25\. [Maintaining secure use of and unfettered access to **space and
cyberspace** are key to effective deterrence and defence]{.underline}.
We will e[nhance our ability to operate effectively in space and
cyberspace to **prevent, detect, counter and respond to** the full
spectrum of **threats,** using all available tools.]{.underline} A
single or cumulative set of **[malicious cyber
activities]{.underline}**; or hostile operations to, from, or within
space; could reach the level of armed attack and could lead the North
Atlantic Council to invoke Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. [We
recognise the applicability of international law and will promote
responsible behaviour in cyberspace and space. We will also boost the
resilience of the space and cyber capabilities upon which we depend for
our collective defence]{.underline} and security.

26\. We will pursue a more robust, integ[rated and coherent approach to
building national and Alliance-wide resilience against military and
non-military threats and challenges to our security, as a national
responsibility and a collective commitment rooted in Article 3 of the
North Atlantic Treaty.]{.underline} We will work towards identifying and
mitigating strategic vulnerabilities and dependencies, including with
respect to our critical infrastructure, supply chains and health
systems. We will enhance our energy security and invest in a stable and
reliable energy supply, suppliers and sources. We will ensure civil
preparedness to provide for continuity of government, the delivery of
essential services to our populations and civil support to our armed
forces. We will boost our capacity to prepare for, resist, respond to,
and quickly recover from strategic shocks and disruptions, and ensure
the continuity of the Alliance's activities.

[In order [to deter China from using ASAT weapons, China's leaders would
have to calculate]{.mark} that an [ASAT]{.mark} attack would [lead
to]{.mark} an [escalation]{.mark} of conflict or to damaging
retaliation. [In peacetime, Beijing]{.mark} would probably
[calculate]{.mark} that an [ASAT]{.mark} attack might **[risk being seen
as]{.mark} a [casus belli]{.mark}**. If so, it is [unlikely]{.mark} that
[China's]{.mark} kinetic or directed energy [weapons]{.mark} would be
[used **outside of conflict.** If]{.mark}, however, [Washington and
Beijing]{.mark} are already [engaged in an armed clash]{.mark}, the
[threat of]{.mark} **the use of force in** [space is]{.mark} somewhat
[moot]{.mark}. Washington could, for example, threaten to escalate the
conflict by warning that an attack on a satellite will result in the
destruction of China's space launch complex. [Beijing]{.mark} may
nonetheless [calculate that]{.mark} at this stage of its military
modernization, **[interfering with US satellites is worth any
retaliatory interference]{.mark}** with their own satellites, and that
the risk of escalation in other domains is either low or acceptable.
There is some evidence that [Chinese]{.mark} military [leaders]{.mark}
may [**underestimate risk** and **overestimate**]{.mark} **the utility
of [asymmetric attacks]{.mark}**.]{.underline} China has little
experience with the arms control negotiations that underpinned nuclear
deterrence, has a different conceptual framework for conflict and
international relations, and lacks the experience of the Cold War for
interpreting American actions and signals. [[Chinese military
concepts]{.mark} on "deterrence" **[differ significantly]{.mark} from US
concepts**, meshing Schelling's ideas of deterrence and compellence in
ways that [encourage use and increase]{.mark} the risk of
**[miscalc]{.mark}**ulation]{.underline}.7 Deterring Chinese ASAT
attacks during armed conflict would require threatening something other
than China's own satellites, since the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is
not yet so dependent on space assets that the satellites' loss would
constrain their operations as much as the loss of American satellites
would hurt US forces. [In this situation, Chinese leaders may see an
exchange of satellite attacks as working to their benefit. [Only
a]{.mark} **credible [threat to retaliate against a terrestrial
target]{.mark}** [would change China's calculus]{.mark}, but such
threats bring the risk of escalation of conflict that would need to be
weighed carefully.]{.underline} Responding to an attack on a military
target in space or a military cyber network with an attack on the
Chinese homeland would likely be seen by China as escalatory.
Additionally, nationalist sentiment among the citizens of potential
opponents like China or Iran suggests the most likely effect of US
escalation unless it was sustained and broadly destructive, would be to
reinforce support for the regime and for a continuation of the conflict.
Belief shapes perception. The Kremlin believed that the United States
was inherently aggressive and sought the destruction of the Soviet
Union. Soviet political and military leaders debated whether the US
investment in weapons was to retain a credible deterrent or to attain
first strike capabilities. [**[Paranoia]{.mark} also colors** how
authoritarian **[Chinese military leaders]{.mark}** may [underestimate
risk]{.mark} and [overestimate]{.mark} the [utility of]{.mark}
asymmetric [attacks]{.mark}. regimes that lack domestic legitimacy view
the United States. **[Cultural and linguistic differences]{.mark}** also
[contribute to **misinterpretation**]{.mark} **of deterrent
messages.**]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Lasers Alt Cause

#### Chinese laser attacks are an alt cause 

\*Brian **Chow and** \*\*Henry **Sokolski 20**, \*Senior Physical
Scientist and Professor at RAND Corporation and \*\*Executive Director
of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, 7/10/2020, "Op-ed \|
U.S. satellites increasingly vulnerable to China's ground-based lasers",
Space News,
https://spacenews.com/op-ed-u-s-satellites-increasingly-vulnerable-to-chinas-ground-based-lasers/

The [[D]{.mark}efense [I]{.mark}ntelligence [A]{.mark}gency
[warned]{.mark} in January 2019 that [China]{.mark} likely will
[field]{.mark} in 2020 a ground-based [laser weapon that can
counter]{.mark} low-orbit space-based sensors. By the **mid**-to-late
**2020s** it may field **higher** **power** **systems** that could
**damage**]{.underline} the structures of non-optical
[**[satellites]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

How [[real]{.mark} is the [threat]{.mark}? Analysts have already
identified [five Chinese laser]{.mark} [bases]{.mark}. One in Xinjiang
has four main buildings. One of these building is thought to be for
tracking satellites, while equipment in the other three could be used to
dazzle or disable satellite sensors.]{.underline} If the Xinjiang
facility is representative of the other four, all five bases can be
located and are vulnerable to aerial attacks.

In addition to these bases, [[China operates **several** satellite
**laser** **ranging**]{.mark} [**stations**.]{.mark} These have been
used to determine the orbits of satellites and space debris but could be
[used to **damage** U.S. and **allied** **satellite**]{.mark}
sensors.]{.underline}

Of the world's 50 satellite laser ranging stations, five fixed stations
are in Shanghai, Changchun, Beijing, Wuhan and Kuming. Two Chinese
satellite laser ranging stations are mobile.

The ranging system at the Shanghai station uses a laser with a
relatively low average power of 2.8 watts. The wattage at other stations
are most likely the same or lower. Another laser of 60 watts at the
Shanghai station has been used routinely to measure space debris.
Calculations show that a 1-watt laser has 1 in 1,000 chance to cause
permanent damage to a sensor, while a 40-watt laser would double the
chance. These odds are low but likely to increase.

In the near term [China's top priority is to deny America and its allies
imagery with high resolution of 10 centimeters or better. Fortunately,
[to damage]{.mark} a [satellite's optical elements]{.mark} such as
pixels and filters, an offensive anti-satellite [laser]{.mark} would
[have to be located within]{.mark} roughly [10]{.mark}
[kilometers]{.mark} of what one wants to take a picture of.]{.underline}

What should Washington do to [[counter]{.mark} sensor-damaging
[lasers?]{.mark} First, it [**should** **determine**]{.mark} how many of
the [**Chinese** **targets**]{.mark} it wants to take pictures of that
have a laser base or fixed satellite laser ranging station within
roughly 10 kilometers. T]{.underline}here are probably only a few such
laser-protected targets.

Second, our [military and intelligence analysts need to **estimate** the
risks and costs **of** **[snap]{.mark}ping**
**[pic]{.mark}ture[s]{.mark}** from space of these laser-protected
targets]{.underline} (i.e., the chance of our satellites' sensors being
damaged and what their repair or replacement costs might be) and the
benefits of getting such imagery. Such an analysis would likely
recommend that the United States and its allies:

[Take pictures whenever possible during peacetime, as the chance of
damage is far higher during crisis.]{.underline}

[Update imagery less frequently, because fewer trips mean less chance of
being hit.]{.underline}

[Use as low a resolution for imagery as much as possible, as
low-resolution sensors and their satellites are cheap and numerous
compared to dedicated military imagery satellites]{.underline}

Third, the United States [should **secure** **imagery** of all needed
resolutions, including 10 centimeters or better, any way it can using
commercial and dedicated military systems during peacetime, crisis and
wartime.]{.underline} Once it has a diversified group of imagery
providers, laser damage to a few of our sensors would become far less
valuable to our adversaries, leading them not to initiate such attacks
in the first place.

Finally, the [United States should extend the 2010 New Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty, which expires in February 2021, to **[keep]{.mark}**
its formal [**prohibitions** **on** i]{.mark}nterference with national
technical means of verification (including [**sensor**-**carrying**
**satellites**]{.mark}) in force.]{.underline} To the extent that
Washington can bring China into arms negotiations with the Russians, it
should focus on getting Beijing formally to agree to this prohibition.

The U.S. government will need to do more in the years ahead. Today,
Chinese lasers must be located within roughly 10 kilometers of whatever
Washington wants to snap pictures of to have any hope of beaming into
American satellites' telescope openings and damaging their sensors
inside. Mid-decade, though, when Beijing acquires higher powered lasers,
at least one of China's lasers will be in range to damage several of our
low earth orbiting satellites every day. As a result, Washington will
not only have to make our satellite constellations resilient and harden
some satellites' exteriors and sensors, it must be prepared to disable
China's laser systems if they attack our satellites.

During this same period, the [United States will also have to [pay
attention]{.mark} [to Chinese satellite laser]{.mark} ranging [stations
and **high** **power** **lasers**]{.mark} that will have gone mobile.
Be[cause]{.mark} these mobile systems are likely to be
[dual]{.mark}-[use,]{.mark} they [**cannot** **be**
**banned**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Instead, the [United States and its
allies should disadvantage any hostile use with diplomatic measures that
would afford warning of such.]{.underline}

This could best be achieved by [[push]{.mark}ing [for]{.mark} an
international [agreement to]{.mark} register all mobile dual-use lasers
(including their locations), **[require]{.mark}** their
**[operators]{.mark}** to **[announce]{.mark}** their **planned**
**[movement]{.mark}** a [**month** **in** **advance**,]{.mark} and
demand their movements be broadcast in real time.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Lasers Alt Cause

#### China developed laser technology and are inclined to use them -- satellite attacks inevitable

[Space lasers are a real thing, even if they're not generally made to
blow up passing satellites]{.underline}. [Designed to **damage or
disable sensor equipment** on orbiting satellites, ground-based lasers
can help hide a nation's activities]{.underline}. Photography from
satellites, for example, has been key in helping reveal the extent of
Beijing's detention of Muslim Uighurs in western China. Weeks before the
Federation of American Scientists produced analysis showing missile
silos being built in western China, [US-based **analysts** -- drawing
attention to anti-satellite lasers in Xinjiang -- warned that **US
satellites**, the kind that could keep an eye on China's military, were
"**increasingly vulnerable** to **China's ground-based
lasers**".]{.underline} Sydney-based space analyst Chris Flaherty said
that when it came to lasers, "dazzling", or [interfering with a
satellite's camera, and "blinding", permanently damaging a satellite,
"are the **prime technologies** that are **deployable right
now**".]{.underline} The technology [gives a country the power "to deny
a satellite's **ability to operate**, to **shut it down** or to damage
it -- **without** creating **space debris**]{.underline}". Michael
Duitsman of the California-based James Martin Centre for
Nonproliferation Studies said the [laser facility in Xinjiang was
thought to have been started as far back as 2009]{.underline}. It
"significantly predates both the Uighur cultural genocide and the
current missile silo construction," he said. Inspecting images from
earlier this year, Duitsman said there had been some construction in the
support area for the laser, as well as modification at one of the
buildings. [Concerns about the use of lasers used this way in a future
space conflict are spreading]{.underline}. The prospect of a contest for
space dominance between China, the US and Russia prompted the US to
create the Space Force in 2019. Last month, Defence Minister Peter
Dutton announced Australia would begin exploring options for Space
Electronic Warfare, because it's a capability that doesn't "create
debris or damage the space environment". Flaherty said to [better
understand China's intentions with lasers aimed at satellites, one need
only look at the example Russia provides]{.underline}. In 2018, Russia
unveiled its Peresvet laser system and positioned it near mobile units
of intercontinental ballistic missiles. In doing so, it can temporarily
[**blind passing satellites** overhead from taking
pictures.]{.underline} Flaherty said "**[any superpower]{.underline}**
that has important strategic assets \... **[will deploy a
laser]{.underline}**". [US-based China space analyst Dean Cheng believes
Beijing would likely have installed them to **frustrate the satellite
photography** of its military bases and equipment]{.underline}. "It
would not be surprising if the Chinese wanted to limit Indian ability to
see into Tibet," said Cheng. He said lasers could be used to protect one
of China's missile silo fields, as well as naval and air bases that
could be used in an invasion of Taiwan. But the ability to use lasers
against satellites is well known by space-faring powers. "What is more
problematic is that the [West **relies more on space** for the conduct
of military operations, so effective anti-satellite systems work much
more to the benefit of" Russia or China, which focus their military
closer to their own regions]{.underline}, Cheng says. Economically, the
West has more to lose in such a scenario because widely adopted Western
technologies such as [GPS have evolved to **rely on peaceful access to
space**]{.underline}. Simply raising questions about China's
capabilities to disrupt a rival nation's satellites is part of the new
game, one that differs from the Cold War rivalry. The [physical distance
of orbit makes it hard to know with certainty whether an outage of a
satellite happened as a cause of an accident, or if something was the
**result of hard-to-detect aggression.**]{.underline} For example, in
[2006, China used a laser that temporarily **blinded a US military
reconnaissance** **satellite**]{.underline}. "The action temporarily
blinded the satellite but caused no permanent damage, leading to
speculation that China may not have been intentionally trying to
interfere with the satellite," said US congressional testimony in 2019.
Like the ambiguity of attributing the origin of a cyber attack, the
cause of a problem in orbit is hard to determine as the satellite passes
200 kilometres overhead at a speed of 25,000 km/h. Messing with a
rival's satellites in orbit in ways that can easily be misinterpreted,
using lasers, or some other directed energy, is a change from the Cold
War. Back then Russian or American interference with each other's
satellites could easily be interpreted as a prelude to a nuclear launch,
and so was something to generally avoid. Today, while the nuclear risk
hasn't gone away -- as China's missile silo building proves --
technology has evolved, orbits have grown much more crowded, and so has
the willingness of some space powers to court risk. [China, among
others, has been on a mission to build space power since it -- and the
world -- witnessed volleys of US satellite-guided bombs raining down on
Iraqi troops during the Persian Gulf War of 1991]{.underline}. "The Gulf
War set off the next technology trend for countries to catch up,"
Flaherty said. Since then, [many more satellites and nations have
entered orbit, producing data and services we rely on daily: GPS,
space-based timing for transactions, Google maps, precise weather data
for agriculture]{.underline}. If [China or another]{.underline} [power
used lasers aggressively against orbiting satellites]{.underline}, it's
no longer about two superpowers facing off like during the Cold War
space race, said Flaherty.

### 1NC -- No Attack

#### Chinese cyber threats are overblown -- the U.S. is far more advanced in its cyber and military capabilities and the lack of coordination in the Chinese military decks its ability to launch a major satellite cyber attack

Jon R. **Lindsay 15**, an Associate Professor at the School of
Cybersecurity and Privacy at the Georgia Institute of Technology with a
joint appointment in the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs and
the School of Public Policy, "Exaggerating the Chinese Cyber Threat,"
May 2015, Policy Brief, Quarterly Journal: International Security,
<https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/exaggerating-chinese-cyber-threat>

[The secrecy [regarding]{.mark} the [cyber
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} and activities of the United States
and China creates difficulty in estimating the relative balance of cyber
power across the Pacific. Nevertheless[, [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [appears to be gaining an]{.mark} increasing
[advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}. For every type of purported Chinese
cyber threat, there are also serious Chinese vulnerabilities and growing
Western strengths.

Much of the international cyber insecurity that China generates reflects
internal security concerns. China exploits foreign media and digital
infrastructure to target political dissidents and minority populations.
The use of national censorship architecture (the Great Firewall of
China) to redirect inbound internet traffic to attack sites such as
GreatFire.org and GitHub in March 2015 is just the latest example of
this worrisome trend. Yet [prioritizing political information control
[over]{.mark} technical cyber defense also damages [China\'s]{.mark} own
[cyber]{.mark}security]{.underline}. Lax law enforcement and poor cyber
defenses leave the country vulnerable to both cybercriminals and foreign
spies. [[The **fragmented**]{.mark} and notoriously competitive
**[nature of the Communist Party]{.mark}** state further **[complicates
coordination across military]{.mark}**, police, and regulatory
**[entities]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

There is strong evidence that [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} continues to
engage in aggressive cyber espionage campaigns against Western
interests. Yet it [[struggles to convert]{.mark} even legitimately
obtained [foreign data into competitive advantag]{.mark}]{.underline}e,
let alone make sense of petabytes of stolen data. Absorption is
especially challenging at the most sophisticated end of the value chain
(e.g., advanced fighter aircraft), which is dominated by the United
States. At the same time, [the United States conducts its own cyber
espionage against China]{.underline} , as the Edward Snowden leaks
dramatized, [which can indirectly aid U.S. firms (e.g., in government
trade negotiations)]{.underline}. China\'s uneven industrial
development, fragmented cyber defenses, erratic cyber tradecraft, and
the market dominance of U.S. technology firms provide considerable
advantages to the United States.

[[Despite]{.mark} high levels of [Chinese]{.mark} political harassment
and [espionage, there is **little evidence of skill**]{.mark} or
subtlety [in China\'s military cyber operations]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Although Chinese strategists describe cyberspace as a highly asymmetric
and decisive domain of warfare, [[China\'s military cyber]{.mark}
capacity [does not live up to its]{.mark} [doctrinal
aspirations]{.mark}]{.underline}. A disruptive attack on physical
infrastructure requires careful testing, painstaking planning, and
sophisticated intelligence. Even experienced U.S. cyber operators
struggle with these challenges. By contrast, [the Chinese military is
rigidly hierarchical [and has **no wartime experience with complex
info**]{.mark}rmation **[systems]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Further,
[[China]{.mark}\'s pursuit of military \"informatization\"]{.underline}
(i.e., emulation of the U.S. network-centric style of operations)
[[increases its]{.mark} dependence on vulnerable networks and
**[exposure to foreign cyberattack]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

To be sure, [[China engages in aggressive cyber]{.mark} campaigns,
[especially against]{.mark}]{.underline} nongovernmental
[[organizations]{.underline}]{.mark} and firms [[**less equipped** to
defend]{.mark} themselves [**than government entities**. These]{.mark}
activities]{.underline}, however, [[**do not** constitute **major
military threats against the** **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates,
[and]{.mark} they [do not]{.mark}hing to [defend China from the]{.mark}
considerable intelligence and [**military advantages of the**
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}.

"Cyber Operations as Imperfect Tools of Escalation," Strategic Studies
Quarterly, Vol. 13, No. 3, p. 122-145

[[There is a]{.mark} widespread [view]{.mark}]{.underline} among
practitioners and scholars [[that cyberspace is defined by]{.mark} an
inherent potential for dangerous escalation dynamics between
rivals]{.underline}.1 On the practitioner side, for example, senior US
intelligence and military [leaders expressed concerns about
[first-strike incentives]{.mark} leading to escalation]{.underline} in a
2017 joint statement to Congress, testifying that "adversaries equipped
with \[offensive cyber capabilities\] could be prone to preemptive
attack and rapid escalation in a future crisis, because both sides would
have an incentive to strike first."2 On the academic side, [there is a
palpable fear that cyberspace is an environment in which [offense has
advantages]{.mark} over defense and that this]{.underline}---[[coupled
with]{.underline}]{.mark} factors such as problems of attribution, poor
command and control, and the [[absence of]{.mark} meaningful thresholds
or [red lines]{.mark}---generates real risks of inadvertent
escalation]{.underline}.3 Concerns about escalation grew even more
passionate in the wake of the US Department of Defense's release of its
2018 Cyber Strategy document, which articulates an operational concept
of "defending forward" in which the DOD "disrupt\[s\] or halt\[s\]
malicious cyber activity at its source."4

However, [[there are]{.mark} important [**empirical** reasons to
suspect]{.mark}]{.underline} that the [[risks of cyber escalation may be
exaggerated]{.underline}]{.mark}. Specifically, [if
cyberspace]{.underline} is in fact an environment that (perhaps even
more so than others) [generates severe escalation risks, why has cyber
escalation not yet occurred? [Most interactions]{.mark} between cyber
rivals [have been]{.mark} characterized by [**limited volleys** that
have **not escalated** beyond nuisance levels]{.mark} and have been
largely contained below the use-of-force threshold]{.underline}.5 For
example, in [[a survey of cyber incidents]{.mark} and responses between
2000 and 2014]{.underline}, Brandon Valeriano et al. [[find]{.mark} that
"[rivals]{.mark} tend to [respond only to lower-level]{.mark} \[cyber\]
[incidents]{.mark} and [the response tends to check the intrusion **as
opposed to seek escalation dominance**]{.mark}. The [majority of]{.mark}
cyber escalation [episodes are]{.mark} at a low severity threshold and
are [non-escalatory. These]{.mark} incidents [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
usually '[[tit-for-tat]{.mark}']{.underline} type [responses within one
step of the original incident]{.underline}."6 [[Even in the two rare
examples]{.mark} in which [states employed kinetic force]{.mark} in
response to adversary cyber operations]{.underline}---the US
counter-ISIL drone campaign in 2015 and Israel's airstrike against Hamas
cyber operatives in 2019---[[the]{.mark} use of [force was circumscribed
and did not escalate]{.mark} the [overall conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}
(not to mention that force was used against nonstate adversaries with
limited potential to meaningfully escalate in response to US or Israeli
force).7

### 1NC -- No Escalation

#### Cyber attacks don't cause escalation -- resources, reversibility, and lesser impact 

Sarah **Kreps, 19** --- (Sarah Kreps; Political Science Department,
Cornell University, Published: 9-29-2019; \"Escalation firebreaks in the
cyber, conventional, and nuclear domains: moving beyond effects-based
logics\"; OUP Academic; Accessed: 6-26-2022;
https://academic.oup.com/cybersecurity/article/5/1/tyz007/5575971)//Pen-SY

The [perseverance of the firebreak has come to define nuclear
strategy]{.underline}, especially for the United States.1 It is also
increasingly central to debates around US cyber strategy. Therefore, as
critics of the persistent engagement strategy argue, [understanding the
logics of cyber escalation is vitally important to the strategy's
success \[]{.underline}49--51\]. Despite the importance of escalation
for current US cyber strategy success, there is [very little scholarly
consensus about [cyber escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 As Joseph Nye
asserts, "escalation ladders and thresholds are poorly understood" in
the cyber realm \[66\]. A number of scholars and policymakers argue that
cyber operations do not change the fundamental nature of escalation. For
these scholars, it is the [**[effects created by weapons]{.underline}**
[that matter]{.underline}]{.mark} [for escalation and [not necessarily
the means or the domain in which the effects are
created]{.mark}]{.underline}. Cyberspace operations may have unique
qualities, but the [fundamental [logics of escalation are tied to
weapons' effects]{.mark} and rather than how these effects are
delivered.]{.underline} As long as cyberspace operations can create
similar effects as operations in other domains, they create the same
escalation ladders. The debate within this literature is about the
technical ability of cyberspace operations to create the same effects as
the other domains \[56, 59, 60, 62, 67, 68\]. Kostyuk et al., e.g.,
equate permanent damage to civilian infrastructure as the cyber
equivalent of a nuclear war and existential attack, all of which should
warrant a comparable escalatory response. They caveat that "at present,
[we [**do not believe** a single mode of cyber attack]{.mark} alone
[would pose an existential threat to the US]{.mark}]{.underline},
however, this may change in the near future" \[69\]. [Scholars within
this line of reasoning devote significant attention to understanding the
**[difficulty cyberspace operations have achieving access]{.mark}**, the
[**resources required** for creating complex
effects]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the [[**highly-reversible nature** of
most cyberspace operations]{.mark}.]{.underline} Glaser and Farrell
provide an effects-based typology and point to five characteristics of
effects that may decrease escalation of cyberattacks: physical versus
nonphysical damage (first- or second-order physical effects), no visible
damage, military versus civilian, attacks that kill versus those that do
not, and attacks in war versus peace \[13\]. According to this
understanding of cyberspace and escalation, responses to a cyberattack
should not be qualitatively different from any other attack as long as
cyberattacks can advance to the level of nuclear or large-scale
conventional capabilities \[57, 59\]. [[Until cyberspace attacks]{.mark}
can [provide]{.mark} the [decisive edge]{.mark} toward taking territory
or create the lethal effects comparable [to large-scale or nuclear war,
they **will not be treated the same**]{.mark} as attacks in other
domains]{.underline}. The perspective is largely consistent with
Valeriano and Maness's quantitative analysis of cyberspace operations,
who find cyber operations to be largely low intensity and find no
evidence of higher intensity retaliation to cyber attacks \[69\].

### 2NC -- No Escalation

#### Cyberattacks will not escalate -- cyberattacks repeatedly evoke minor responses that don't lead to escalation

Overall, [[there is **little**]{.mark} **public [evidence]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark} hostile events in cyberspace echo strongly outside it.
Indeed, **rarely** do [events in cyberspace]{.mark} -- much less
escalation in cyberspace -- [lead to serious responses at
all]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Some research suggests that even severe
[cyberattacks would]{.mark} generally [**be less likely than kinetic
attacks** to induce a response]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although opening
cyberattacks can precede kinetic attacks, there are also cases when war
comes as a surprise and cyberattacks are not used until the proper
accesses to target systems have been gained. [Cyberattacks have the
potential to put hitherto sacrosanct targets -- notably space systems,
and other NC3 elements -- in play, **but [cyberattacks]{.mark} have
reportedly [taken place against satellites]{.mark}**]{.underline} while
kinetic attacks (weapons tests aside) [**[have not]{.mark}**, so
far]{.underline}. The failure to respond to cyberattacks may have played
a role in enabling missile attacks on Saudi Aramco facilities, but the
link is distant (seven years earlier) and tenuous. There is no analog
(yet) in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. [Several reasons could be adduced
to explain the lack of correlation. One is that while there could be
cyberattacks consequential enough to [induce echoes in the physical
world]{.mark}, none have reached that threshold and it may well be that
**[none could reach that threshold]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even as the
attack surface for cyberspace operations keeps growing, hackers grow
more talented, and their leaders more aware of the gains available from
such operations -- defense is not sleeping. Those who own networks are
taking cybersecurity seriously (at long last), cloud computing may have
helped put defenses in the hands of those for whom protection is a
profit center, and the cybersecurity industry itself is robust.
Succeeding generations of software -- e.g., versions of Windows
operation systems -- are also more impervious to intrusions. [Two is
that, in common with many widely-feared phenomena, [cyberattacks have
evolved]{.mark} from an acute problem (one both rare and fearsome) [to a
**chronic problem**]{.mark} (more common, but **[something that one can
adjust]{.mark} to**). Three, [the]{.mark} oft-expressed [belief that
cyberwar is war has yet to take hold]{.mark}. Because
[cyber]{.mark}space [operations are]{.mark} ambiguous (and not easily
grasped even when clear) and their effects almost always [temporary and
not]{.mark} (yet) [lethal]{.mark}, they may be considered something
separate and apart.]{.underline} Time will tell whether this distinction
will continue to be observed.

#### Cyberattacks aren't perceived as an "armed attack" -- they are non-lethal and elicit weaker responses than kinetic attacks

4\. PROPOSITION: CYBERATTACKS WILL BE TAKEN AS SERIOUSLY AS EQUALLY
DAMAGING KINETIC ATTACKS If countries react to cyberattacks as they
would to equivalent kinetic attacks, then an escalation in cyberspace
(defined as above) could well result in a comparable escalation in
physical space -- again with the expected effects on international
stability. But would they? Much of the answer depends on what
constitutes "comparable." [[Kinetic military effects]{.mark} tend to
[include death]{.mark} and destruction[. **No cyberattack has killed
anyone directly**]{.mark}, and few have actually broken physical things;
wiping a hard drive -- as many **[cyberattacks]{.mark}** have done --
still **[leave]{.mark}s** the hard drive **[physically
intact]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But cyberattacks have been quite costly
to their victims, even if measured solely in disruption and remediation
costs. The NotPetya attacks were said to have cost their (mostly
corporate) victims up to \$8 billion (Greenberg 2018). Putatively, a
kinetic attack that destroys \$8 billion worth of military equipment but
harms no one would be comparable and should, one would imagine, bring
about a comparable reaction. Imagining a kinetic attack that breaks
things but hurts no one used to be an exercise in fantasy. [But [the
Iran]{.mark}ian take-down of a \$150 million U.S. Global Hawk in the
summer of [2019]{.mark} was such an [attack]{.mark}. The [U.S.
**response**, a cyberattack, was]{.mark} also
**[non-lethal]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Lest this choice of avoiding
lethality be ascribed to the individual characteristics of the U.S.
President, note that the Pentagon was also thinking along similar lines.
One of its favored options was to sink an Iranian craft, but only after
giving its sailors time to get away (Baker, Schmitt, and Crowley 2019).
Earlier, a Turkish shootdown of a Russian jet near the Syrian border had
drawn a cyber response (e.g., DDOS attacks), but nothing violent (Murgia
2015). Returning to NotPetya, the U.S. reaction to this costly event was
a limited set of sanctions. If Russia had deliberately disabled
commercial satellites whose total replacement value summed to that much,
would the United States have also limited its response to sanctions? One
might counter that many of the affected corporations were not
U.S.-headquartered: for example, Maersk, a Danish shipping company. If
that matters, then replace United States by NATO and re-ask the
question. [So, while [**the non-lethality of cyberattacks** means that
a]{.mark} plausible **[response would be non-lethal]{.mark}**, the
failure to respond to NotPetya suggests that the broad scope of the
cyberattack may have also played a role.]{.underline} [Perhaps a
cyberattack that damages software and thereby levies costs on victims is
different in kind from a comparably costly kinetic attack that damages
hardware. [Research]{.mark} by Professor Jacqueline Schneider
[casts]{.mark} further **[doubt that a cyberattack would be treated
as]{.mark} [tantamount to a]{.mark}** comparable **[kinetic
attack]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see Kreps and Schneider 2019). The
results of two exercises -- one conducted at the U.S. Naval War College
and the other on-line -- suggest that [**[cyberattacks]{.mark}**
introduced into a simulated crisis [were]{.mark} more often
**[ignored]{.mark}** or, [at most, **motivated a weak response** in
comparison to]{.mark} comparable [kinetic attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In fairness, the United States has been used as the exemplar of how
countries may respond to cyberattacks and other countries may react
differently. But the United States deserves attention because it has
responded most overtly, whether through public statements, levied
sanctions, or news reports (Israel is also active, but it is a far
smaller country and unique in many relevant respects). It is unclear
whether the difference is that the United States suffers more
cyberattacks than other countries (or seems to in part because of
uncensored media coverage) or whether other countries have covert ways
of responding that are not widely known. That noted, Jensen and
Valeriano (2019) indicate that when citizens of the United States,
Russia, and Israel were given a scenario with a major cyberattack, only
a small percentage chose to escalate as a result. Roughly half of the
respondents wanted something less than a titfor-tat response. They
concluded that, "to date, cyber operations have tended to offer great
powers escalatory offramps". [Conclusion: [cyberattacks would be deemed
**less likely to garner a kinetic response than** ]{.mark}**would
[kinetic attacks]{.mark}** that levy comparable costs, [because they
are]{.mark} generally **[nonlethal]{.mark}** and somehow considered
[less serious and **more easily recovered** from]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- No Escalation -- Grid

#### Critical infrastructure attacks don't generate [anywhere near]{.underline} the impact required to trigger escalation

Institute at the United States Military Academy at West Point and a
research fellow at the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at
Columbia University; and Shawn W. Lonergan, research affiliate of the

Point, Ph.D. in Political Science from Columbia University, Fall 2019,
"Cyber Operations as Imperfect Tools of Escalation," Strategic Studies
Quarterly, Vol. 13, No. 3, p. 122-145

Even under circumstances in which a state may possess the right cyber
response capabilities at the desired time, its response may not generate
sufficient costs against the target to be perceived as escalatory.41
[[Fundamental limits on]{.mark} the [cost-generation]{.mark} potential
[of]{.mark} offensive [cyber **op**]{.mark}eration[**s** stem from the
fact]{.mark} that [cyber capabilities lack]{.mark} the [physical
violence]{.mark} of conventional and nuclear ones. Cyber weapons target
data]{.underline}; they disrupt, manipulate, degrade, or destroy data
resident on networks and systems or in transit.42 Moreover, aside from
those cyber capabilities that permanently destroy data and for which
there are no backups to which a target can revert, [cyber [effects are
temporary and]{.mark} often [reversible]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [utility of military instruments]{.underline} of power for the
purposes of coercion or brute force [inheres in their abilities to
inflict---or credibly threaten]{.underline} to inflict---[significant
damage and harm against a target state]{.underline} (its civilian
population or its military forces) to achieve a political objective.43
[Cyber weapons]{.underline} could be (and have been) used to [disrupt an
adversary's networks and systems]{.underline}---overwhelming them such
that they temporarily lose the ability to function or the target loses
confidence in their reliability---or even to produce destructive effects
by destroying data resident on these systems or, in rarer circumstances,
producing effects in the physical realm.44 [[While]{.underline}]{.mark}
conducting [[multiple cyberattacks against]{.underline}]{.mark} a
targeted state's [[critical]{.mark} national
[infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [[could in theory
generate significant]{.mark} economic and national security
[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [**[temporal aspects]{.mark}**
of offensive cyber operations]{.underline} as described above
[[limit]{.mark} the [ability of even]{.mark} the most capable [states to
sustain]{.mark} persistent, high-cost [effects against multiple
strategic targets]{.mark}]{.underline} over time. [There is simply no
guarantee that a state can generate significant costs against a target
[in]{.mark} the context of [an unfolding crisis]{.mark}.
This]{.underline} reality [starkly contrasts with the relative
predictability and reliability of conventional effects]{.underline}.
Indeed, [[the empirical record]{.mark} has largely [validated
this]{.mark} claim; "the vast majority of malicious [cyber
activity]{.mark} has taken place far below the threshold of armed
conflict]{.underline} between states, [and [has not risen to the level
that would trigger]{.mark} such a [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}."45
This is why, in Lin's parlance, "[going cyber is pre-escalatory" and
countervalue [cyberattacks]{.mark}]{.underline} (those [[that target
civilian]{.underline}]{.mark}, rather than military, [[assets]{.mark})
occur "all the time now and [are at the **BOTTOM of the escalation
ladder**]{.mark}]{.underline}" \[emphasis in original\].46 [Rather than
their ability to wreak permanent, destructive effects, cyber operations
are]{.underline} often [prized for their temporary and reversible
nature]{.underline}.47

One metric to assess the cost-generation potential of offensive cyber is
in terms of loss of life. By this measure, cyber operations are unlikely
to inflict significant harm. While theoretically possible that cyber
operations could lead directly to a loss of life, [no one
has]{.underline} reportedly [died]{.underline} to date [as a direct
result of a cyberattack despite over 30 years of recorded cyber
operations]{.underline}.48 [Even in hypothetical catastrophic scenarios,
the cost in terms of human casualties is minimal]{.underline}. For
instance, [common **[worst-case scenarios]{.mark}** of cyberattacks
[revolve around]{.mark}]{.underline} the [loss of power stemming from a
[cyberattack on **a**]{.mark}n **electric
[grid]{.mark}**]{.underline}.49 However, [even in this instance, the
conceivable damage]{.underline} from the loss of power over an extended
period [is far less than that which could be wreaked using basic,
limited conventional capabilities]{.underline}. To draw a comparison,
[[when Hurricane Sandy hit]{.underline}]{.mark} the United States'
eastern seaboard in late October 2012, over [[8]{.mark}.5
[million]{.mark}]{.underline} people [[were]{.mark} left [without
power]{.mark}]{.underline}---with [many]{.underline} going **[weeks and
even months]{.underline}** before it was brought back online.50 Yet a US
National Hurricane Center postmortem of Hurricane Sandy reported that of
the [[159 people]{.underline}]{.mark} in the United States
[[killed]{.underline}]{.mark} either directly or indirectly, only "about
50 of these deaths were the result of extended power outages during cold
weather, which led to deaths from hypothermia, falls in the dark by
senior citizens, or carbon monoxide poisoning from improperly placed
generators or cooking devices."51 [[If a cyberattack took out power of a
similar magnitude]{.mark} and duration]{.underline} of Hurricane Sandy,
it is conceivable that [an [equivalent]{.mark} number of [casualties
would result]{.mark}]{.underline}. The 2015 synchronized cyberattacks
against Ukrainian power companies, attributed to Russia, was the first
known example of an offensive cyber operation targeting a state's power
grid. Its cost was ultimately low---service was temporarily disrupted to
225,000 customers for several hours, and energy providers operated at a
limited capacity for some time after service was restored.52 There were
no reported casualties from this power outage. While any casualty
resulting from a cyberattack would certainly be lamentable, [[**even
worst-case scenario figures are minor** in comparison to]{.mark} the
cost in human lives stemming from other, even [limited, kinetic]{.mark}
military **[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### 1NC -- Lasers Alt Cause

#### Russian laser attacks are an alt cause

Matthew **Humphries 5/18**, has a Bachelor\'s degree in Computer Science
and a Master\'s degree in Games Development, "Russia Claims Its Peresvet
Laser Weapon Can Blind Satellites, Burn Drones", 5/18/2022, PCMag,
https://www.pcmag.com/news/russia-claims-its-peresvet-laser-weapon-can-blind-satellites-burn-drones

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} claims to [[have]{.mark} a [**laser**
**weapon** that can **blind** **satellites**]{.mark} in orbit around
Earth]{.underline} as well as \"inflict thermal destruction\" on a drone
in mid-air from miles away.

As Reuters reports(Opens in a new window), the [mobile laser weapon is
[called Peresvet]{.mark} and was first announced back in 2018 by
Vladimir Putin]{.underline}. At a conference in Moscow yesterday,
[deputy prime minister Yury Borisov stated that a [recent test had seen
the laser burn up a drone]{.mark} 5km (3 miles) away [in just five
seconds]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Borisov went on to claim that, [\"it [can blind **all** **satellite**
reconnaissance **systems**]{.mark} of a likely enemy [in orbits
of]{.mark} [up to 1,500 km, disabling them during flight due to]{.mark}
the use [of laser radiation]{.mark}.\" Perhaps this is [how
Russia]{.mark} [intends to take down Starlink **if** **hacking**
**continues** **to** **fail**]{.mark}]{.underline}?

Peresvet is apparently [[being **mass** **produced**]{.mark} within
Russia [and supplied]{.mark} to its troops. If true, it suggests Russian
forces may be using the mobile laser system in its war with
Ukraine]{.underline}, although there\'s been no evidence of that
presented thus far.

Borisov goes on to claim [that \"unannounced [successors]{.mark}\" to
the existing Peresvet system are [**in** **development**]{.mark} and
that, \"This is primarily a laser weapon, an [**electromagnetic**
**wideband** **weapon**]{.mark} that will **[replace]{.mark}**
([**conventional** **weapons**]{.mark}) in the next decade - this is not
some sort of exotic idea; **it** **is** the **reality**.\"]{.underline}

### 1NC -- No Attacks

#### Russia won't attack satellites out of fear of nuke war

Nancy **Gallagher 20,** Director at the Center for International and
Security Studies at Maryland, published 05-2020, "Space Governance and
International Cooperation", CISSM /billy

When applying the Strategic Stability logic to space, most U.S. defense
analysts are missing the biggest reason why the United States should be
willing to go beyond dialogue, transparency, and voluntary norms to
stronger, more reliable forms of security cooperation---the connection
to nuclear weapons and terrestrial strategic stability. [[DOD
officials]{.mark} engaged in the space policy reviews have [said that
the main]{.mark} [reason]{.mark} why the [**Soviets never attacked**
U.S. satellites was because]{.mark} [they believed that **would lead**
to]{.mark} a **[nuclear war]{.mark}**.]{.underline} These officials
assume that adversaries will be less inhibited now because the United
States would probably respond to most kinds of space interference with
non-military or conventional means. In other words, increased nuclear
strategic stability has decreased space strategic stability.

### 1NC -- No Escalation

#### Russian cyberattacks happening now -- cyberattacks against Ukraine prove no escalation

Josephine **Wolff 22**, an associate professor of cybersecurity at The
Fletcher School at Tufts University, March 2022, "Why Russia Hasn't
Launched Major Cyber Attacks Since the Invasion of Ukraine," Time
Magazine, Technology,
<https://time.com/6153902/russia-major-cyber-attacks-invasion-ukraine/>

[In the]{.underline} relatively short and rapidly evolving [history of
cyber conflict]{.underline}, perhaps [nothing has been]{.underline}
established with greater certainty and [more widely accepted than the
idea that [Russia has]{.mark} significant [cyber capabilities and isn't
afraid to use them]{.mark}]{.underline}---especially on Ukraine. In
2015, Russian government hackers [breached the Ukrainian power
grid](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/),
leading to widespread outages. In 2017, Russia deployed the [notorious
NotPetya
malware](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/) via
Ukrainian accounting software and the virus quickly spread across the
globe costing businesses billions of dollars in damage and disruption.
In the months that followed the NotPetya attacks, many
people [speculated](https://www.npr.org/2017/06/22/533951389/experts-suspect-russia-is-using-ukraine-as-a-cyberwar-testing-ground) that
Ukraine served as a sort of "testing ground" for Russia's cyberwar
capabilities and that those capabilities were only growing in their
sophistication and reach.

[As tensions escalated [between Russia and Ukraine]{.mark}, many
[people]{.mark} were **[expecting]{.mark} the conflict to have
[significant cyber components]{.mark}**]{.underline}---the United States
Department of Homeland Security even issued
a [warning](https://thehill.com/policy/international/russia/595945-cyber-officials-urge-federal-agencies-to-armor-up-for-potential) to
businesses to be on high alert for Russian cyberattacks, [as
did](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60158874) the U.K.'s National Cyber
Security Centre. What is surprising is that---so far, at least---the
devastating Russian cyberattacks everyone has been expecting have yet to
materialize. There's no guarantee, of course, that a large-scale
cyberattack on [Ukraine's electrical
grid](https://time.com/6153039/ukraines-electricity-grid-escape-russia/) or
global banks or anything else isn't just around the corner. [[Russia has
proven]{.mark} time and again [that it has few compunctions
about]{.mark}]{.underline} targeting critical infrastructure and
[[causing]{.mark} considerable collateral [damage through]{.mark} acts
of [cyber aggression]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[But as the invasion continues]{.mark} with few signs of any
sophisticated cyber conflict, [it seems **less**]{.mark} **and less
[likely]{.mark}** [that Russia has **significant cyber
capabilities**]{.mark} **[in reserve]{.mark}**, ready to deploy if
needed]{.underline}. [Instead, [it]{.underline}]{.mark} [begins to [look
like Russia's]{.mark} much vaunted [cyber capabilities have been
neglected]{.mark} in recent years[, in favor]{.mark} [of
developing]{.mark} less expensive, [**less effective cyber weapons**
that]{.mark} cause less widespread damage and [are]{.mark} considerably
[**easier** to]{.mark} contain and **[defend]{.mark}
[against]{.mark}.**]{.underline} For instance, many of the [cyberattacks
directed at Ukraine in the past month have been relatively basic
distributed denial-of-service
attacks](https://therecord.media/ddos-attacks-hit-websites-of-ukraines-state-banks-defense-ministry-and-armed-forces/),
in which hackers bombard Ukrainian government websites and servers with
so much online traffic that those servers cannot respond to legitimate
users and are forced offline for some period of time. [Denial-of-service
attacks can be effective for short-term disruptions [but]{.mark} they're
[hardly a]{.mark} new or [impressive]{.mark} [cyber
capability]{.mark}---in fact, they're what Russia used to target Estonia
more than a decade ago in 2007]{.underline}. Moreover, launching these
types of attacks requires no sophisticated technical capabilities or
discovery of new vulnerabilities, and they typically have fairly
contained impacts on the specific, targeted computers. Similarly, recent
reports that Belarusian hackers are [trying to phish European
officials](https://www.cyberscoop.com/ghostwriter-phishing-refugees-nato-russia-ukraine/) using
compromised accounts belonging to Ukrainian armed services members
suggests that not only are these efforts relying on fairly basic tactics
like phishing emails, they are not even being carried out by Russian
military hackers directly.

#### No cyber escalation

"Cyber Operations as Imperfect Tools of Escalation," Strategic Studies
Quarterly, Vol. 13, No. 3, p. 122-145

[There are important empirical reasons to suspect]{.underline} that [the
[risks of cyber escalation may be exaggerated. If
cyberspace]{.mark}]{.underline} is in fact an environment that
[[generates]{.mark} severe [escalation risks, **why has cyber escalation
not**]{.mark} **yet [occurred?]{.mark}**]{.underline} We posit that
cyber escalation has not occurred because [[cyber
**op**]{.mark}eration[**s** are poor tools of
escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}. In particular, we argue that [this
stems from [key characteristics of offensive cyber capabilities]{.mark}
that [limit escalation]{.mark} through four mechanisms]{.underline}.
First, [[retaliatory]{.mark} offensive cyber
**[op]{.mark}**eration[**s** may not exist at the desired time]{.mark}
of employment]{.underline}. Second, [even under conditions where they
may exist, [their effects are uncertain and often]{.mark} relatively
[limited]{.mark}]{.underline}. Third, [several [attributes of offensive
cyber **op**]{.mark}eration[**s** generate]{.mark} important [tradeoffs
for decision-makers that]{.mark} may [make them hesitant]{.mark} to
employ capabilities in some circumstances]{.underline}. Finally, [the
alternative of [cross-domain
escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[responding to a cyber incident
with]{.mark} noncyber, [kinetic instruments]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[is
unlikely to be chosen]{.mark} except under rare circumstances,
[given]{.mark} the [limited cost-generation]{.mark} potential
[of]{.mark} offensive [cyber
**op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Quick timeframes are a [neg]{.underline} warrant\-\--[defenders]{.underline} can patch vulnerabilities within [minutes]{.underline}, but escalation requires attackers to have [sustained access]{.underline}\-\--those [defensive pauses]{.underline} prevent cyber-space escalation and allow decisionmakers to defuse crises

Quarterly, Vol. 13, No. 3, p. 122-145

Third, these limitations become even more salient when we consider how
strategic interactions are likely to play out over time during repeated
crisis interactions. [Because the virtual domain is changeable in a way
that the physical world is not, [actions]{.mark} taken [by **defenders**
in]{.mark}]{.underline} the context of [[a crisis can]{.mark} radically
and [unpredictably alter an attacker's ability to]{.mark} deliver and
[sustain effects]{.mark} against a target]{.underline} over time.30
[Access and capabilities are neither guaranteed nor indefinite---they
have a shelf life]{.underline}.31 [[Footholds into a]{.mark} target's
[network]{.mark} that were time intensive to develop [can **unexpectedly
disappear as vulnerabilities**]{.mark} **in a network [are
patched]{.mark}**[. Exploits]{.mark} may [have a short shelf
life]{.mark} as [revealing]{.mark} information about [them enables
targets to]{.mark} identify indicators of compromise]{.underline} (IOCs)
[and use these to [prevent further damage]{.mark}]{.underline} from
specific malware strains or quarantine malicious traffic using known
malware signatures. An example of the latter is the US Cyber Command
initiative, beginning in 2018, to share information about adversary
malware by uploading samples to VirusTotal.32 Therefore, [[a target can
"transition from vulnerability]{.mark} (to a particular attack) [to
invulnerability in, **literally, minutes**]{.mark}]{.underline}."33
Third-party disclosure about software vulnerabilities by governments or
private actors can also unintentionally precipitate the loss of access
as exposure about vulnerability information enables network defenders to
take measures to remedy them.34 For instance, the disclosures that began
in 2016 by the group Shadow Brokers of purportedly pilfered US National
Security Agency exploits and zero days ostensibly put US government
accesses at risk.35 Put simply, [a vulnerability upon which an access
relies may in theory be only one update or disclosure away from being
patched]{.underline}.

Thus, [in the context of an ongoing crisis interaction between an
attacker and defender, the former's **op**erational tempo is likely to
be interrupted by the latter's behavior, forcing the attacker to devote
additional time to find or acquire new vulnerabilities and
exploits]{.underline} in the midst of an offensive operation or
campaign. As Inglis notes, [to succeed in an offensive cyber campaign
that unfolds over time, attackers must be able to sustain "the efficacy
of tools under varying conditions caused by the defender's
response]{.underline} and the natural variability and dynamism of
cyberspace."36 The [[ability to build]{.mark} or acquire [new
accesses]{.mark} and capabilities "[in real time" during a crisis is
**highly limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}.37 Indeed, General Paul Nakasone
remarked in a January 2019 interview on the radical difference in shelf
life between conventional and cyber capabilities:

Compare the air and cyberspace domains. Weapons like JDAMs \[ Joint
Direct Attack Munitions\] are an important armament for air operations.
How long are those JDAMs good for? Perhaps 5, 10, or 15 years, sometimes
longer given the adversary. When we buy a capability or tool for
cyberspace . . . we rarely get a prolonged use we can measure in years.
Our capabilities rarely last 6 months, let alone 6 years. This is a big
difference in two important domains of future conflict.38

Therefore, as a 2013 Defense Science Board report notes, "[offensive
cyber will always be a fragile capability" when pitted against network
defenders who are "continuously improving network defensive
tools]{.underline} and techniques."39

[[Each side can take defensive measures]{.mark} to blunt the impact and
effectiveness of the other's access and
capabilities]{.underline}---particularly as information about them is
revealed. Consequently, [strategic accesses and [capabilities]{.mark}
are likely to [become]{.mark} more vulnerable and [less reliable over
time, **shrinking**]{.mark} **the set of cyber [escalatory]{.mark}
response [options for all parties]{.mark}**[. This]{.mark} cycle [is
likely to generate]{.mark} temporal [breaks in the pace of adversarial
engagements]{.mark} in cyberspace]{.underline}, where states must
regroup and develop or rebuild accesses and capabilities during an
ongoing interaction. [[These pauses]{.mark} are likely to [**diffuse the
pressure** that]{.mark} typically
[accompanies]{.mark}]{.underline}---even defines---[[crisis situations,
creating **breathing space**]{.mark} and, by extension, **room for
decisionmakers to deliberate alternative courses of action**, for
domestic political tensions to cool down, [for intent to be
communicated]{.mark} to adversaries, [and]{.mark} for **[de-escalation
pathways to be determined]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

A potential counter to this argument is that most states likely already
appreciate the time and resources required to develop accesses and
tools, as well as their fragility. Therefore, those with sufficient
resources are incentivized to alleviate these concerns through investing
heavily in developing the ability to gain pre-positioned accesses and a
range of capabilities and platforms to be prepared for the onset of a
potential future crisis. Evidence of this kind of behavior could be, for
example, the discovery of Russian malware in US critical infrastructure
reported in 2018.40 While dormant access is almost certainly the case,
states are likely to remain stymied by inadvertent or deliberate
discovery of these efforts prior to a crisis. More importantly, [**[even
if]{.mark}** pre-positioned accesses and [capabilities are available in
the opening]{.mark} moments [of a crisis]{.mark}, the [difficulties of
**maintaining them**]{.mark} during iterated volleys between adversaries
are likely to persist and **[blunt]{.mark} the
[ability]{.mark}**]{.underline} of a given party **[[to continue
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}** of cyber capabilities.

### 2NC -- No Escalation -- Tech Barrier

Second, in addition to being dependent on access, [[offensive]{.mark}
cyber [capabilities lack universal effectiveness]{.mark}]{.underline}.
While nuclear or conventional munitions are target agnostic---in most
cases, the same munition can be used to target an aircraft hangar, a
massed enemy formation, a munitions factory, or a hospital---some
[[cyber weapons must be **tailored to a specific target**]{.mark} set or
type]{.underline}.23 As Martin Libicki notes, "[A piece of malware that
brings one system down may have absolutely no effect on
another]{.underline}. The difference between the two may be as simple as
which patch version of a piece of software each system runs."24 The 2017
WannaCry ransomware attack that wreaked billions of dollars in damage
and was attributed to North Korea's Lazarus Group, for instance,
targeted hundreds of thousands of computers around the world across a
range of industries that were running an older version of Windows.25 The
widespread damage belies the highly specific and targeted nature of the
malware---almost all of the affected systems were running a version of
Windows 7; the same strain of malware had no effect on computers running
more up-to-date operating systems. Moreover, [asset [owners of targets
of strategic significance]{.mark}]{.underline}[---[such as critical
infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}---typically [[employ]{.mark} highly
[customized]{.mark} software and specific hardware with [tailored
configurations]{.mark} that are [unique to those systems]{.mark}
and]{.underline} usually [[only]{.mark} intimately [understood
by]{.mark} the [original **dev**]{.mark}eloper**[s]{.mark}** and
manufacturers]{.underline}. It has been reported, for example, that the
malware employed in the Stuxnet cyberattacks against the Iranian nuclear
program was tailored to target the specific model of Siemens
programmable logic controllers (PLC) used at the Natanz enrichment
facility.26 Indeed, while Stuxnet was discovered in computers around the
world, it delivered destructive effects only against the centrifuges in
Natanz.27 The [[non-substitutability of]{.mark} entire classes of
[offensive capabilities]{.mark} by definition [increases]{.mark} the
[cost]{.mark} of developing an arsenal of offensive cyber
capabilities]{.underline}.28

Therefore, the [[time and resource requirements to gain access and
develop specific]{.mark} offensive [capabilities]{.mark} may
**[render]{.mark} important [escalatory response options
infeasible]{.mark} or impractical**]{.underline} at the desired time.
[Operational planning and execution must consider that [a]{.mark} given
[capability may not be usable or even exist at a chosen time]{.mark} of
employment]{.underline}.29 As the above discussion illustrates, [many of
[the target sets that]{.mark} would [represent]{.mark} strategic (and
therefore [escalatory) targets, such as]{.mark} a state's [critical
infrastructure or nuclear command]{.mark} and control, [demand
extensive]{.mark} planning, [pre-positioning, and capability development
in advance]{.mark} of employing offensive capabilities]{.underline}.
Therefore, the [**[timing of a crisis plays a crucial role]{.mark}** in
decisions about cyber escalation responses]{.underline}. Specifically,
[the [time required to develop access]{.mark} to hold strategic targets
at risk [means]{.mark} that]{.underline}, [**[even if a state seeks to
escalate]{.mark} against an adversary [using cyber means]{.mark}**[, it
may find itself **limited by**]{.mark} **the [accesses and capabilities
it possesses at the moment]{.mark} a crisis occurs**]{.underline}. Cyber
response options may be limited to less decisive or more vulnerable
target sets, rather than those that are more strategically significant.

### 2NC -- No Escalation -- Attribution

#### Lack of attribution is a [neg]{.underline} warrant\-\--nobody will escalate randomly before they've attributed an attack, and that [time delay]{.underline} builds in opportunities for de-escalation

Second, beyond operational requirements for secrecy, [[states]{.mark}
make political decisions to [**eschew attribution** for offensive cyber
**op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.64 [States employ
technical methods to avoid attribution]{.underline} (e.g., [[obfuscating
points of departure]{.mark} of attacks [by using spoofing, proxy
servers, third-party infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}, compromised
certificates, and other anonymizing capabilities) [as well as make
deliberate efforts to obscure command and control for
cyberattacks]{.underline} (e.g., [[using]{.underline}]{.mark} cyber
[[proxies]{.mark} with varying degrees of plausible
deniability]{.underline}).65 The [[time requirements for a targeted
state to achieve attribution]{.mark} at a reasonable confidence
threshold, [as well as]{.mark} its [willingness to share]{.mark}
potentially [sensitive **intel**]{.mark}ligence information with allies
or domestic publics [to justify]{.mark} any [escalatory responses,
create **additional temporal breaks for**]{.mark} **the [pressure of a
crisis]{.mark} situation [to diffuse]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} for
[decision-makers to **evaluate alternative courses**]{.mark} **of
action**]{.underline}.

### 1NC -- Article 5 Not Key

#### No internal link -- no card is [reverse causal]{.underline} and says the plan stops the US from overreacting -- the US could [respond on its own]{.underline} without activating Article 5.

In light of the recent developments of NATO, it would seem to be in
[[NATO's]{.underline}]{.mark} best interest to remain ambiguous and
allow the organization to approach its [[response
to]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[cyber]{.mark}-attack]{.underline} on a
case-by-case basis. [For instance]{.underline}, the
[[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} on Estonia [[might **require
intervention** on behalf of]{.underline}]{.mark} the Estonian people due
to the fact they are [[a small]{.mark}er, [less]{.mark}er [defensible
state]{.mark}]{.underline}. Estonia would not be successful standing up
against Russia, and as Russia becomes more aggressive in the
former-Soviet bloc region, small states like Estonia are at risk. If
another attack were to occur against Estonia, the [[attacks would have
to be]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[severe to invoke]{.mark} an **[Article
5]{.mark}** response]{.underline}. Such a response would enable NATO
states to act as if they too have been attacked as per the mutual
defense announcement against cyber-attacks at the Wales Summit. [[Yet,
if the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [is attacked]{.mark} in a
similar manner, [there]{.mark} likely [does not need to be the same
scale of defense]{.mark} taken, because [the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [has **more resources** and **capabilities** to
**respond on its own**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Remaining ambiguous allows
NATO to choose the best opportunities for supporting and defending
member states.

### 1NC -- Commercial Alt Cause

#### Cyber-vulnerabilities can be inserted at any point in the satellite supply chain and remain latent [indefinitely]{.underline}\-\--no way the aff can solve it

[[For a successful cyberattack]{.underline}]{.mark} to occur, [[the
threat]{.mark} vector [needs to be inserted within the system. This
could take place during]{.mark} the **[manufacture, distribution or
operation]{.mark}** of the products and services that characterize the
system]{.underline}. During the manufacturing and distribution phases,
conventional physical security controls need to be applied to minimize
the risk of cyberattacks. However, during operation, the conjunction of
electromagnetic and cyber vulnerabilities becomes critical. [[As]{.mark}
telecommunication [systems integrate complex **tech**]{.mark}nology to
improve performance]{.underline}, flexibility and efficiency, [[they are
increasingly dependent on software that can be modified during
operation]{.mark} rather than hardware or firmware that remains
relatively unchanged]{.underline} once it has been designed and
deployed. One example is the C-RAN (Cloud-Radio-Access-Network) concept
being developed as part of the evolution of terrestrial mobile networks,
and this type of software will be integrated into future satellite
systems. Commercial tools such as SIM-toolkits are increasingly used to
perform over-the-air provisioning and denial of service. Over-the-air
software (both operating system and application) upgrades will be
familiar to everyone using smart devices.

The [[ability to]{.mark} emulate a network, and to [access]{.mark},
configure [and control]{.mark} communications [devices via wireless
interfaces during normal operations]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[offers
opportunities to an attacker to launch a large-scale cyberattack that
**remains latent**]{.mark} **within a system [indefinitely]{.mark}**[,
until activated]{.mark} at a time of the adversary's
choosing]{.underline}.

[[There exists]{.underline}]{.mark}, therefore, [a [need to create
infrastructure]{.mark} and procedures [that allow full]{.mark} system
[vulnerability assessment]{.mark} to be undertaken and mitigation
strategies to be developed]{.underline}, taking into account both
electromagnetic and cyber techniques. [Such facilities need to be
[available during]{.mark} the **[design, development and operational
phases]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As the internet has become
near-ubiquitous, as devices become ever more interconnected and as
critical infrastructure becomes more complex, vulnerability to
cyberattacks is increasingly becoming the focus of network security,
risk management, mitigation and resilience techniques. [A
multidisciplinary approach to vulnerability assessments and the design
and implementation of mitigation strategies is required]{.underline},
while cybersecurity and wireless professionals alike require both
greater awareness and sophisticated tools. Assuring the space-based
capability must be the principal driver of the agenda. The industry
needs to take stock of the GNSS vulnerabilities and develop pragmatic
approaches to countering them,41exploring and adapting new technologies,
and building in redundancies.42 This will include ascertaining the
prevalence of unintentional jamming and interference, and how jamming
and spoofing play out in the realm of offensive state-initiated
cyberattacks or may be used by terrorist groups.

### 1NC -- Cyber Norms Fail

#### Cyber governance [fails]{.underline} to stop risks to satellites\-\--tech changes [too fast]{.underline} and offensive capabilities are [too diffused]{.underline}

• Cyberattacks on satellites can include jamming, spoofing and hacking
attacks on communication networks; targeting control systems or mission
packages; and attacks on the ground infrastructure such as satellite
control centres. Possible [[cyberthreats against space]{.mark}-based
[systems include]{.mark} state-to-state and [military actions;
**well-resourced organized criminal elements**]{.mark} seeking financial
gain; **[terrorist groups]{.mark}** wishing to promote their causes,
even up to the catastrophic level of cascading satellite collisions;
[and **individual hackers**]{.mark} who want to fanfare their
skills]{.underline}.

• Space is changing from a selective preserve of wealthy states or
well-resourced academia, into one in which market forces dominate.
Current technologies bring space capability into the reach of states,
international organizations, corporations and individuals that a decade
ago had no realistic ambition in this regard; and capabilities possessed
a few years ago only by government security agencies are now in the
commercial domain.

• The [[pace at which **tech**]{.mark}nology [evolves makes
it]{.mark}]{.underline} hard, or even [[**impossible**, to devise a
timely response to space cyberthreats]{.underline}]{.mark}. Humans too
are affected by 'digital ageing' and legacy issues, and younger people
use space-based and cyber communications in ways that make it difficult
for older generations -- and thus by implication some senior
decision-makers -- to fully understand the range of technologies and
threats.

• Technology alone cannot provide the basis for policymaking on
cybersecurity. [Entirely or largely technological approaches do not have
the breadth or depth to allow comprehensive participation, and would
**exclude many stakeholders** who could otherwise contribute
usefully]{.underline} to responses to the variety of threats propagated
through the internet.

• Development of a flexible, multilateral space and cybersecurity regime
is urgently required. [International **[coop]{.mark}**eration [will be
crucial, but]{.mark} highly [regulated action]{.mark} led [by
government]{.mark}]{.underline} or similar institutions [[is likely to
be **too slow to enable**]{.mark} **an [effective response to
space-based cyberthreats]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Instead, a lightly
regulated approach developing industry-led standards, particularly on
collaboration, risk assessment, knowledge exchange and innovation, will
better promote agility and effective threat responses.

• An international 'community of the willing' -- made up of able states
and other critical stakeholders within the international space supply
chain and insurance industry -- is likely to provide the best
opportunity to develop a space cybersecurity regime competent to match
the range of threats.

### 2NC -- Cyber Norms Fail

#### Attribution's impossible\-\--means the plan's norm can't be enforced 

Kenneth **Lieberthal 12**, director of the John L. Thornton China Center

at Brookings; and Peter W. Singer, director of the 21st Century Defense
Initiative and a senior fellow in Foreign Policy at Brookings, February

https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/0223_cybersecurity_china_us_lieberthal_singer_pdf_english.pdf

Beyond just the issue of terminology, however, there are also other
[dimensions in the cyber arena that are especially consequential to
U.S.-China relations]{.underline} and **[must inform any process aimed
at engagement]{.underline}**. Put simply, in this dynamic arena, [it is
necessary to [be realistic about what]{.mark} types of
[activities]{.mark} can potentially be brought under control through
agreed-upon actions and what things [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
effectively **[[beyond the capacity of institutions to
control]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is important to appreciate why this
is so and, in that context, to focus on those areas that are still
potentially subject to meaningful controls. Perhaps the [[most difficult
is]{.underline}]{.mark} the problem of
**[[attribution]{.underline}]{.mark}**.41

The [ability to capture]{.underline} the operations of [another computer
and]{.underline} use it to [launch activities]{.underline} that [its
owner does not intend]{.underline} and might even be unaware of
(described inside the field as to "pwn," a computer hacker term meaning
to "own") [is very well developed and widely used]{.underline}. This
often takes the form of creating botnets that link unrelated computers
and enable the controller to leverage their combined computing and
communications capabilities for a particular purpose. [[The]{.mark}
resulting [network of]{.mark} secretly [linked devices can]{.mark}
easily [grow to extraordinary dimensions]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
example, three not terribly sophisticated Spaniards allegedly created a
global botnet that included over twelve million computers.42 In other
cases, a controller may seek to capture and leverage only one or a small
number of computers. In this case, the major purpose is more likely to
be to conceal the controller's identity.

[Three key features of this capability to capture and utilize other
computers are particularly important]{.underline}. First, [[there are
**no geographical limits**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, [a
pernicious actor in Brazil can compromise computers in Russia and South
Africa to launch attacks on systems in China]{.underline} (one can
substitute almost any countries for the ones named here). Second, [the
owner of [a captured computer]{.mark}]{.underline} typically [[has no
idea that the computer is being used]{.mark} by a remote actor [for
pernicious purposes]{.mark}]{.underline}. And third, [[when]{.mark} some
pernicious [activity is perpetrated, sophisticated analysis
can]{.mark}]{.underline} typically, [[at best, identify the
computer]{.mark} being used to launch the attack. [It is far more
difficult to determine whether that computer is]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
turn, [[being remotely controlled and]{.underline}]{.mark}, if so, [[by
whom]{.underline}]{.mark}. Equally, even if it is not being remotely
accessed, in many situations (such as a computer being used at a
university or an internet café), [it will be difficult to determine who
the individual behind the computer is]{.underline}, or even what [his
nationality]{.underline} is [or what organization he actually
represents. [Such information]{.mark} would be **crucial in a crisis**
but [is **rarely available**]{.mark} in a timely manner]{.underline}. In
short, [[it is]{.underline}]{.mark} typically [[not feasible to identify
the]{.mark} underlying [command structure]{.mark} behind an attack
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} complete [[certainty]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Instead, painstaking forensics may be a key driver to understanding the
full chain of events.

It does not take much imagination to see how pernicious the resulting
problems can be. [Since many]{.underline} are inclined to
[assume]{.underline} that [the Chinese government is behind most
insidious activities]{.underline} that [are launched by computers
located in China]{.underline}, for example, **[[bad actors elsewhere
may]{.underline}]{.mark}** be inclined to [**[capture Chinese
computers]{.mark}** to use in their activities, [and vice versa for the
U.S. This]{.mark} same logic]{.underline}, though, also [**[enables
Chinese bad actors to deny responsibilit]{.mark}y**,
arguing]{.underline} that [activities launched from China]{.underline}
almost certainly [are being perpetrated by others who want to take
advantage of the widespread suspicions of China]{.underline}. And the
same type of misdirection can be argued regarding computers physically
located inside the U.S.

The issue of [attribution is]{.underline} further [complicated
by]{.underline} the [difficulty of establishing complicity]{.underline}.
An effort might be attributed to an actor emanating from a certain
geographic locale, but [[it is]{.mark} even [more difficult to establish
a]{.mark} formal role of a [government as perpetrator]{.mark} or
sanctioner of the operation]{.underline}. That is, the situation often
parallels that of maritime security in centuries past, where the lines
between what was criminal piracy and what was state-sanctioned
privateering often proved fuzzy.43 There have been frequent reports of
"[patriotic hacker" communities and other [non-state
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}, including student and even cyber criminal
groups that [[have been mobilized]{.mark} by their governments
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} such purposes of **[[deniable, but directed,
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}**.44 Thus, in certain cases where the local
state government may be needed to investigate and then prosecute those
behind questionable cyber activity, the victims perceive that some
elements of the state are actually a willing accomplice or planner of
the attack, and thus unlikely to assist. An example would be the DDoS
attacks on Estonia. Many believed Russian security services actually
instigated them and thus that Russia was certainly not interested in
finding and stopping the perpetrators.45

Attribution is further complicated by the fact it is quite difficult
initially to determine even whether a packet is intended to be "hostile"
or not (as one expert put it, "[Packets are not like
ICBMs]{.underline}"). A DNS query, for instance, may be a legitimate
look up attempt or it may be an attempted penetration. And, even in the
latter case, it may be a legitimate DNS lookup or it may be part of a
large scale DDoS attack. On top of this, once malware enters into a
system, it does not necessarily bear a telltale sign of where it was
designed and sometimes even what its actual intent may be. Unlike
fissionable materials, for example, where each nuclear reactor has a
distinctive "signature" that typically permits tracking the origins of
the material, [even when malware is uncovered it usually does not point
a finger at a particular culprit]{.underline}.

The [long-running effort to figure out the origin and intent of the
Conficker worm illustrates this problem]{.underline}. The worm was one
of the most effective in recent history, assembling a global botnet of
some 7 million compromised computers in networks that ranged from the
British Parliament to Southwest Airlines to the French and German
military to scores of computers in China (one security expert called it
"the Holy Grail of a botnet"). Yet, [even as the worm spread,
investigators could only sift through the data for clues to its
origin]{.underline}, which still left them uncertain. In one
breakthrough, [they found certain programming linked to a Ukrainian
language keyboard]{.underline}. But, [even then, they could not conclude
whether this meant the malware was designed in Ukraine or whether the
clue was a clever attempt at misdirection]{.underline}.46

Though we might still believe that outer space is somewhat out of our
reach, the fact is that we are dependent on [[space
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} in many ways. Their [expensive and
vulnerable nature makes them a [**perfect target** for]{.mark} those who
want to severely disrupt [opponents']{.mark} **communication,
coordination, or intelligence activities**]{.underline}. As such,
[[several nations]{.mark} are currently [equipped with]{.mark} or at
least developing means of [satellite disposal]{.mark} that range [from
**ballistic missiles** to **communication
jammers**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, **[China, Russia, India, and even Japan and

**counterspace arsenal** to protect their ever more important space

still in the process, the [[number of nations capable]{.mark} of
in-space operations has increased since the Cold War]{.underline}. The
current geopolitical tension provides a catalyst for further [incentives
for the development of new weapons]{.underline}. Types of ASAT weapons
When we talk about anti-satellite weaponry, what usually comes to mind
are **[[kinetic physical weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The [technology
behind kinetic weapons is [**accessible** to a **greater number of
states**]{.mark}]{.underline} (as it is based on ballistic weapons
already in use) and their [use has [rather horrifying]{.mark} results,
as illustrated clearly by the aftermath of the **[Fengyun-1C
case]{.mark},**]{.underline} which was easily attributed to the Chinese
and harmed the environment disastrously for the next few decades or even
centuries \[1\]. In addition to direct ascent missiles, [[kinetic
weapons]{.mark} can also take the form of a [co-orbital]{.mark} device
-- a satellite [equipped with]{.mark} a payload (usually
[explosive]{.mark}) sent [to]{.mark} an [intercept]{.mark}ing orbit with
[another satellite]{.mark}]{.underline} \[2\]. The [US, China, and India
all have some degree of developed, tested, and somewhat operational
**ASAT kinetic capabilities**.]{.underline} For example, the [Indian
missile test of 2019 (Mission Shakti) or the Chinese 2007 test
(Fengyun-1C), which managed to destroy targeted satellites
successfully]{.underline}. The US did not declare any official
direct-ascent weapons, but it is agreed that their anti-ballistic
missile interceptors could be used against enemy satellites.
Furthermore, the US would be able to quickly develop dedicated ASAT
systems \[3\].

the targeted killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, [Iran flexed a
bit of its ballistic missile muscle in retaliation, striking several
bases in Iraq that housed U.S. troops. Striking a target just across a
national border is relatively easy]{.underline}. What is much harder,
however, is [striking an adversary's satellites]{.underline}. Could Iran

Iran's conventional ballistic missile capabilities, the report fails to
mention that Iran's missile arsenal is fully adequate for reaching
satellites of varying orbits[.]{.underline} [Converting a missile from
**ground attack to space attack** is not necessarily difficult. And
**space is a ripe target**]{.underline}. [Satellites are **virtually
defenseless** from strikes by kill vehicles]{.underline}. The United
States, and virtually [the entire world is dependent on satellites for
peaceful reasons like communications, for navigating by GPS---and for
violent reasons, like guiding precision-guided munition, or snapping
photos from nuclear test sites]{.underline}. One expert on the danger
posed by anti-satellite capabilities wrote, "[the military applications
of ASAT missiles appear fairly obvious.]{.underline} [**China** would
seek to **use the ASAT missiles to knock out U.S. satellites** in order
to degrade its C5ISR \[Command, Control, Computers, Communications,
Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance\]
capabilities]{.underline}, rendering distributed U.S. military and
allied assets unable to communicate or share information." If enough
satellites were knocked out in a conflict scenario, troops would have to
dust of the ole map and compass. Still, striking a satellite is no walk
in the park---and more complicated that just launching a missile into
space. Satellites are small, and some travel along their orbits quite
fast. Striking satellites has been compared to hitting a bullet with
another bullet. No Mental Limitations Challenges aside, could Iran knock
out the United State's satellites? A Defense Intelligence Agency report
acknowledged [**Iran's desire to shape the space battlefield**. \"Iran
recognizes the **strategic value of space and counterspace**
capabilities and will attempt to deny an adversary use of space during a
conflict." Iran does also have some capabilities, due to the
aforementioned ballistic missile arsenal it maintains: "Because of the
inherent overlap in technology between ICBMs and SLVs, Iran's
development of larger, more capable SLV boosters remains a concern for a
future ICBM capability.]{.underline} Also, these [advancements could be
**applied** to **developing a basic ground-based ASAT
missile**]{.underline}, should Iran choose to do so in the future."
Desire aside, Iran has some practical limitations to deal with: "Tehran
states it has developed sophisticated capabilities, including SLVs and
communications and remote sensing satellites, but its SLVs are only able
to launch microsatellites into LEO \[Low Earth Orbit} and have proven
unreliable."

**Progress** in]{.mark} [**multinational** **organizations**]{.mark}

[demonstrated]{.mark} [exoatmospheric capabilities]{.mark} that [brew
unease]{.mark} about the potential for overt conflict in

counterspace capabilities. For instance, Russia has conducted on-orbit
maneuvers that some perceive as hostile, and in April conducted a
missile test with anti-satellite applications, which the United States
condemned.

### 2NC -- Say No -- Turkey

#### Turkey will say no--they've been undermining NATO's cybersecurity with troll groups, the last thing they'll want to do is strengthen it

**Nordic Monitor 19**, The Nordic Research Monitoring Network (Nordic

As [[NATO]{.mark} has been [working on a counter stra]{.mark}tegy [to
neutralize]{.mark} the non-conventional [cyber threat]{.mark} that
originates from Russia, Iran, China and others, NATO member
[Turkey]{.mark} has [secretly]{.mark} been [running]{.mark} a [project
to]{.mark} **[undermine]{.mark}** the [**alliance** **structure** from
within.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [[social media and Internet campaigns]{.mark} run [by]{.mark}
associates of Turkish President Recep Tayyip [Erdoğan harbor]{.mark}
[**anti**-**NATO**]{.mark} and **anti**-**Western** [sentiments]{.mark}
and portray **NATO** and allies as **enemies** that are bent on harming
Turkey. The most vicious [group]{.mark} among various entities that were
[coordinated by Erdoğan]{.mark} and his office is identified as the
[**Pelican** **group**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[President **Erdoğan** [paid]{.mark} a [**visit** to]{.mark} the
**[headquarters]{.mark}** of his troll group Pelican, which is linked to
his son-in-law, Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak. The visit
on August 3, 2019 came [just after announcements by]{.mark} the US and
UK revealing that Turkey's [NATO allies]{.mark} had decided [to create
**cyber**-**armies**]{.mark} to fight against foreign
adversaries.]{.underline}

The [latest developments, in July, 2019, marked a turning point for
Western military strategic planning. Officials from the [US]{.mark} and
the UK revealed that they had [launch]{.mark}ed new
[military]{.mark}/intelligence [divisions to]{.mark} [counter]{.mark}
malign Russian activity and [threats from]{.mark} technologically
sophisticated terror groups such as the [Islamic State]{.mark} in Iraq
and the Levant (ISIL]{.underline}). According to official releases, the
new units will have an offensive and defensive propaganda mandate,
taking the social media fight to Russia as well as to various
state-sponsored terrorist groups using social media platforms to stir
unrest and interfere in the workings of the West.

The [US's National Security Agency (NSA) chief, Gen. Paul Nakasone,
announced the new US cybersecurity directorate on July 23 at the
International Conference on Cyber Security. In parallel, Lt. Gen. Ivan
Jones, the commander of the UK Field Army, said a new army formation of
the UK, named 6 Division (6 Div), would widen its net]{.underline},
looking for a new generation of social media skills. To cybersecurity
expert Zak Doffman, these structures are as close as we have seen in the
West outside the intelligence and private contractor domain to the
government-run hacking groups seen in Russia and China as well as in
Iran and North Korea.

It is obvious that [Erdo[ğan's Ak trolls]{.underline}]{.mark} [(a
speculative term referring to the regime's social media network) will
also be under the surveillance of these divisions because of the alleged
[links to]{.mark} some [**terrorist** **groups**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Furthermore, [Ak troll strategies are [**similar** **to**]{.mark} the
[**hybrid** **threat**]{.mark} posed [**by** **Russia**]{.mark} with its
own unique propaganda war and psychological warfare operations
**targeting** the **US** and its **allies**.]{.underline}

[President Erdoğan's presence at Bosporus Global, the public face of the
Pelican group, was a sign of his support for the hard-core Ak troll
group, which benefited regularly from **anti**-**American**,
**anti**-**Israeli** and **[anti]{.mark}**-[**NATO** rhetoric
for]{.mark} their [propaganda]{.mark}. During the meeting he was
informed about the international activities of the Internet trolls as
well as their projects,]{.underline} in which social media serves
certain regime functions with the goal of protecting Erdoğan's Islamist
authoritarian rule, disseminating false information[, **promoting**
**anti**-**Western** **propaganda** and mitigating
dissidence.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Say No -- Europe

#### The EU will say no--they can't afford to put China on the backburner

Federica **Russo 20**, researcher at the university of Amsterdam,
7/15/2020, "Assessing the EU-China relationship in Cyberspace", EIAS,
https://eias.org/publications/op-ed/assessing-the-eu-china-relationship-in-cyberspace/

The [[global system]{.mark} which is to emerge in the post-pandemic era
-- ever more connected and digitalised -- [will]{.mark} lead to the
[need]{.mark} of reinforced [cyber security]{.mark} mechanisms [and
**diplomacy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, the Internet of Things
(IoT) will significantly expand the frontiers of cyberspace, connecting
sensors and actuators within a cyber-physical ecosystem, reaching 100
billion of objects networked by 2025. According to data reported by the
independent cybersecurity company McAfee, cybercrimes related to
criminals gaining illicit access to personal network costed the world
USD 600 billion in 2017, which is up to 0.8% of the global gross
domestic product (GDP). However, with the advent of IoT, the economic
impact is destined to be even greater because of the extraordinary flow
of data which brings challenges in boosting cyberattack capabilities and
increasing the scale of the disruption across several sectors with a
potential domino effect.

Besides the above-mentioned obstacles, [internal coordination can no
longer be dissociated from international cooperation and key players
such as [**China** **and**]{.mark} the **[EU]{.mark}** will [**have**
**to**]{.mark} **navigate** this complex reality [and act
**accordingly**]{.mark}. The [**EU** **should** **deepen**]{.mark} its
[**ties** **with** **China** in]{.mark} the [framework of]{.mark} a
[pragmatic cyber]{.mark} [partnership to strengthen]{.mark} the
[dialogue, build **mutual** **trust**, **improve**]{.mark} the
**[sharing]{.mark}** of key information to [**mitigate**
**threats**,]{.mark} prompt action in **[response]{.mark}**, enhance
[**law** **enforcement**]{.mark} and shared [understanding of]{.mark}
domestic [**cyber** **policies**]{.mark}, as well as identify lessons to
learn from.]{.underline} For example, the [EU's General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) has been object of research in China following the aim
of improving the country's Cyber Security Law on data
protection.]{.underline}

Evidently, the [world will not benefit from]{.underline} cyber chaos,
generated by the spread of disinformation, intellectual property and
data theft[, or cyberattacks on critical infrastructures.
**[Building]{.mark}** a heterogeneous [**network** **of**]{.mark}
**[partnerships]{.mark}** and a constructive dialogue **[in]{.mark}**
the [**cyberspace** **with** **China**]{.mark}, could also
**[support]{.mark}** the **[E]{.mark}uropean** **[U]{.mark}nion** in
positioning itself as a reliable and stable interlocutor even in the
physical domain, where the veil of mistrust among countries -- along
with societal and economic fractures created by the virus emergency --
is altering the equilibrium of the global system.]{.underline}
International [[**collaboration** **and**
**dialogue**]{.mark}]{.underline} at the bilateral and multilateral
stage will therefore [be **[indispensable]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Say No -- Canada

#### Canada will say no--they're working closely with China over cybersecurity, but the plan puts them on the backburner

Dan **Bousfield 17**, researcher at the university of western Ontario,
8/2017, "Revisiting Cyber-Diplomacy: Canada-China Relations Online",
ResearchGate,
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319142200_Revisiting_Cyber-Diplomacy_Canada-China_Relations_Online

[[New avenues of **Cyber**-**Diplomacy** between **Canada** **and**
**China**]{.mark} emerged during US House Intelligence Committee
hearings over the Chinese manufacturers Huawei and ZTE Inc.]{.underline}
(U.S. Panel, 2012). American concerns about close links between these
companies and the Chinese government have led to bans on their products
in the American national broadband network (China's Huawei, 2012). The
US government drew upon national security concerns to politicize the
Chinese regulation of network effects, [forcing Huawei to abandon its
expansion into the American market and to look instead toward
Europe]{.underline} (Pfanner, 2012). Protectionism through national
security is not new, and cyber threats can be used to undermine the
liberal commitments to trade (seen most recently in the tensions
following the US election). However, as a middle power in the postwar
era, [Canada has long been able to leverage its autonomy to facilitate
greater coordination and cooperation between states.]{.underline} In the
past this was linked to the cultivation of a strong Pearsonian
peacekeeping mythos. However, increasingly, Canada has characterized its
geopolitical image in terms of commerce and finance (Bousfield, 2013).
[The **Cyber**-**Diplomacy** of [Canada's support for]{.mark} the
[Chinese]{.mark} [ICT industry presents **new** **avenues** for
**expanded** **engagement**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In particular, despite
Canadian involvement in North American security arrangements, the
[[Canad]{.mark}i[a]{.mark}n government has been [much more willing to
work with]{.mark} [Chinese]{.mark} ICT [firms to foster]{.mark} the
[image of]{.mark} being a '[Silicon Valley North']{.mark} and it has
**worked** **closely** **with** Chinese **ICT**
**providers**.]{.underline} In addition, [Huawei recently sponsored a
report from the Economist Intelligence Unit on the extent to which
countries were ICT globalized, ranking Canada in the top 10]{.underline}
(The ICT Globalisation Index, 2014). It is important to note that the
report highlighted how [[**cyber**-**security**]{.underline}]{.mark} was
not a primary concern in the relationship between developing and
developed countries, and that ICT globalization also required support
for ICT R&D, for which Canada was ranked first (The ICT Globalisation
Index, 2014). [Thus, there are **[opportunities]{.mark}** for network
efforts to [facilitate]{.mark} ICT globalization despite geopolitical
security concerns, and [ways for]{.mark} middle-power countries such as
[Canada to mobilize]{.mark} their [ICT strengths]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [impact of network effects and ICT development in Canada establish a
foundation for [parallels with China]{.mark}]{.underline} while
establishing the importance of the academy in facilitating non-state
1054 D. Bousfield [diplomacies]{.underline}. This stems from what
Marshall Beier has characterized as the struggles of Canadian
autonomy---namely, the tension between adopting independent policy
positions while also being overshadowed and influenced by closeness to
the American hegemon (Beier, 2005). Specifically, Canada's longstanding
cooperation in the 'Five Eyes Intelligence Community' and the 1946
UK/USA intelligence agreement has meant that Communications Security
Establishment Canada has remained heavily classified and thus largely
unable to [[**engage** **in**]{.underline}]{.mark} public debates about
[[**cyber** **issues**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Cox, 2012). As Barry and
Bratt have described, [Canada's security strategies are a 'defense
against help', that is, doing enough to prevent the United States from
acting unilaterally on Canada's behalf]{.underline} (Barry & Bratt,
2008). This situation also explains [[Canada]{.mark}'s [limited funding
to securitize cyberspace]{.mark}, its delay in formulating a cyberpolicy
framework, and its relative lack of transparency about its cyber policy
options]{.underline} (Levin, Goodrick, & Ilkina, 2013; Van der Meulen,
2013). Secrecy, combined with Canada's desire to preserve market
autonomy in the face of American ICT network effects, has produced an
oligopolistic ISP market with close ties to government interests.
Because the government's goals have been determined by the national
interest in responding to global market forces, discussions in Canada
about user actions and social preferences have fallen to non-state
forums.

Cyber-Diplomacy in China remains defined by strong state centralization
and efforts to pursue regulation through traditional diplomatic forums.
Whereas Canada's middlepowerdom has been characterized by a reliance on
American security mechanisms, [China is increasingly using traditional
sites of diplomacy, such as the UN, to pursue its right to manage
internet access.]{.underline} Proposals from China, Russia and
Tajikistan have utilized intergovernmental forums to push for acceptance
of circumscribed internet rights and efforts to push private governance
of the internet web addresses (through the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers) into systems of governance more directly
controlled by nation states (General Assembly, 2011). The [legitimacy of
the UN system, combined with the justifications for sovereign control of
the amorphous security threats online gives China wide latitude to
institute [**Cyber**-**Diplomacy**]{.mark} as it chooses]{.underline}.
One common impact is China's ability to enforce the removal of
references to the GFC from UN publications and literature, exposing the
susceptibility of Other Diplomacies to hierarchical governance (Deibert,
2012b). [Yet, as Montsion argues, China's ability to access
non-traditional economic actors such as Canadian indigenous groups over
the internet also speaks to challenge Other Diplomacies can pose to
states]{.underline} (Montsion, 2016). [Given that [**Canada** **and**
**China**]{.mark} have several regions defined by graduated sovereignty,
the significance of Other **[Diplomacies]{.mark}** is [**likely** **to**
**continue**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the Hong Kong protests
demonstrated, the ability to constrain the horizontal capabilities of
the internet is a complex relationship between nationalism, regulatory
capacity and local resistance.

### 2NC -- Say No -- Germany

#### Germany will say no--they want to cooperate with China over cybersecurity to improve their economy, but the plan puts them on the backburner

[[**China** **and** **Germany** aim to **wrap** **up**]{.mark} a [deal
over]{.mark} commercial **[cyberespionage]{.mark}** as early as next
year, according to German ambassador to China Michael
Clauss.]{.underline}

The [two [countries]{.mark} had [agreed to start negotiating]{.mark} an
agreement [to abstain]{.mark} from such activity when
[Chancellor]{.mark} Angela Merkel [visited China]{.mark} at the end of
last month, Clauss said.]{.underline}

The aim was to sign the deal at the next Sino-German intergovernmental
consultations in Beijing in the first half of 2016, he said, adding that
the [agreement would cover not only the cybertheft of intellectual
property, but also data security.]{.underline}

[\"Such an [agreement]{.mark} would also help to [**promote**
**bilateral** **innovation** **cooperation**]{.mark}, such as on
Industry 4.0 and Made in China 2025,\" said Clauss, referring to the two
countries\' development strategies for their manufacturing
sectors.]{.underline}

He said [[**private** **companies**]{.mark} and in particular small and
medium-sized firms were [**important** **drivers** **for**]{.mark}
[**Germany\'s** **Industry** 4.0 **strategy**]{.mark}, and that
[China]{.mark} was [hoping to involve more German tech]{.mark}nology
companies [in]{.mark} its [market]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[\"Improving data security and removing obstacles to moving data
internationally would be [important]{.mark} steps [to]{.mark} enhance
[**Sino**-**German** **cooperation**]{.mark} on innovation,\" Clauss
said.]{.underline}

cyberspying as new China-US pact agreed against threat of sanctions

In September, US President Barack Obama hinted he was considering
sanctions against Chinese institutions and individuals suspected of
perpetrating cyberattacks against commercial targets.

At the time, Chinese officials said China was itself a victim of such
attacks and denied the country had any cyberattack forces.

Shortly afterwards, during President Xi Jinping\'s state visit to the US
in late September, Obama said the two countries had reached \"a common
understanding\" against cyberespionage and agreed to \"promote
international rules of the road for appropriate conduct in cyberspace\".

During Xi\'s trip to Britain a month later, the two countries agreed to
establish a \"high-level security dialogue\" on issues such as
cybercrime.

They also [agreed \"not to conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of
intellectual property or trade secrets of confidential business
information with the intent of providing competitive
advantage\".]{.underline}

[[Business exec]{.mark}utive[s]{.mark} are [concerned]{.mark} that a
[lack of progress on]{.mark} protection of [property rights,]{.mark}
market access and data security as well as slow internet speeds will
dissuade foreign investors from entering [China]{.mark} and may **hurt**
the [**business** of those already established]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Clauss said internet speeds in China were a frequent gripe of German
entrepreneurs and needed to be addressed.

Wang Yiwei, the director of the Centre for European Studies at Renmin
University, said that the internet was \"key for reindustrialisation\"
efforts.

[\"[**Cooperation** **and** **innovation** **requires**]{.mark} a
[**consensus** on cybersecurity]{.mark}\", he said.]{.underline}

[\"**Cybersecurity** is becoming a [**prominent** **issue**]{.mark}.

[[Rather than attacking]{.mark} the [satellites]{.mark} on-orbit, an
**[adversary]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[could **achieve similar
effects**]{.underline} [by **attacking**]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
**[ground stations]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that support them]{.mark}.
Ground [stations are]{.mark} perhaps]{.underline} **[[more
vulnerable]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to attack, because they are
[often]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**highly visible**]{.mark}, located
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**foreign countries**]{.mark}, and
relatively]{.underline} **[soft targets]{.underline}**. [For military
communications satellites, the data transmitted to and from
forward-deployed users is often sent via satellite to a teleport ground
station, where it is **relayed**]{.underline} [through another satellite
or terrestrial networks to users around the world.]{.underline} To
reduce the dependence on ground stations, some military space systems
use inter-satellite links to transmit data directly between satellites
without passing through an intermediary ground station.

[Ground [stations are vulnerable to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[kinetic
[physical attack]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[by]{.mark} several means.
**[Guided missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[[rockets]{.underline}]{.mark}** [can be used to attack ground
stations [from]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[range]{.underline}**]{.mark},
[while rocket-propelled **[grenades]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and **small
arms**]{.underline}]{.mark} [fire can be used to disable ground station
antennas [at]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[close
range]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [Ground [stations can]{.mark} also [be
disrupted by attacking the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[electrical [power
grid]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[water]{.mark} lines]{.underline}**[,
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [the high-capacity **[communications
lines]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that support them]{.underline}. While
attacks against ground stations could have large implications, the
effects would not be permanent. Unlike satellites, which require years
to build and often cannot be repaired once they are launched, ground
stations can be repaired in a matter of days or weeks, depending on the
level of damage incurred.

#### Satellites are primarily attacked by targeting ground infra, AND targeting individual ones can't cause their impacts

Sandra **Erwin 5/19**, covered the military, the Pentagon, Congress and
the defense industry for nearly two decades as editor of NDIA's National
Defense Magazine and Pentagon correspondent for Real Clear Defense,
5/19/2022, "U.S. Space Force to step up protection of satellite ground
systems in the wake of Russia's cyber attacks", Space News,
https://spacenews.com/u-s-space-force-to-step-up-protection-of-satellite-ground-systems-in-the-wake-of-russias-cyber-attacks/

Almost [[three months into]{.mark} the [war in Ukraine]{.mark}, it's
still [too early to draw conclusions about Russia's capabilities to
disrupt satellite]{.mark}-based communication[s]{.mark}]{.underline} but
one clear takeaway is the [importance of protecting the ground systems
and network user equipment that provide many entry points for cyber
attackers, a senior U.S. Space Force official said May 19.]{.underline}

Space Force Lt. Gen. B. Chance Saltzman, deputy chief of space
operations for nuclear and cyber, said he has been briefed on the
details of Russian cyber attacks aimed at Ukrainian users of satellite
internet services. "One of the observations that I would offer on that
is that, [if you think the only way to dismantle space capabilities is
by shooting down satellites, you're [missing]{.mark} the [bigger
picture]{.mark} ... as these [cyber attacks are on ground]{.mark}
[networks]{.mark},"]{.underline} Saltzman told reporters at a Defense
Writers Group breakfast meeting.

[The U.S. State Department last week formally blamed Russia for a late
February [cyberattack on Viasat's]{.mark} KA-SAT [satellite]{.mark}
internet network. The attack disabled user terminals in Ukraine and
across Europe that provide internet services to private
citizens.]{.underline} Viasat said the [**[satellite itself was
not]{.mark} [targeted]{.mark}** and the attack **affected 40,000** user
**terminals**, a small fraction of the **[hundreds of
thousands]{.mark}** of customers of the network. Viasat said services
have since been restored.]{.underline}

Separately, Elon Musk tweeted this month that [Russian hackers have been
trying to take down SpaceX's Starlink **broadband** **service** the
company is providing in Ukraine.]{.underline}

[If the [**ground** **infra**]{.mark}**structure** **that**
[**supports** **satellites** becomes]{.mark} the main [target]{.mark},
it will be important to have]{.underline} "assured networks that are
defended by cyber professionals, or we're not going to be effective in
accomplishing our missions," Saltzman said. "[I think that's a
[**critical** **point**]{.mark} that we've learned from this

Operations Command, told SpaceNews last month that the [[most
likely]{.mark} [form of attack facing satellite]{.mark}
network[s]{.mark} today does [**not** happen **in** **space**]{.mark}
[but **on**]{.mark} the [ground]{.mark}. "Cyberspace is the soft
underbelly of our global space networks," said Whiting.]{.underline}

In response, the Space Operations Command is retraining cybersecurity
specialists who protect desktop systems at Space Force bases to more
demanding roles defending military satellite networks.

Saltzman said more time will be needed to evaluate the events in Ukraine
as the conflict grinds on. "As a history major from Boston University, I
will say some of these things take time and perspective to really draw
the lessons. However, there's clear observations that you can't ignore."

He said one of those observations is that [[satellite services]{.mark}
today are [**nearly** **impossible** **to** **disrupt**]{.mark}
completely [because of]{.mark} the [large numbers of]{.mark}
[satellites]{.mark} that are [now operating]{.mark} in
orbit]{.underline}, Saltzman said, echoing comments made last week by
the Space Force's vice chief of space operations Gen. David Thompson.

"The [commercial capabilities that have been given to the Ukrainians,
those are in proliferated constellations like Starlink, and we're seeing
the value,"]{.underline} said Saltzman. [Proliferated constellations are
"[very hard to deny,]{.mark} because it's such a widespread set of
targets. You [**can't** **just** **jam** **one**]{.mark} [satellite and
achieve that effect]{.mark}."]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Solar Flare Alt Cause

#### Various extreme space weather conditions makes satellite disruption inevitable

Assuming a [[satellite]{.mark} survives the launch and calls home
without any troubles, it [faces]{.mark} a [consstant **battle for
survival**]{.mark} out in the harshness of space]{.underline}. Even
Earth satellites in low orbits can see [temperature swings of [minus
50°C]{.mark} (-58°F) [to plus 50°C]{.mark} (122°F) [every 90 minutes,
which can have a **big effect**]{.mark}]{.underline} on the equipment
onboard, as can the lack of air. "Materials that you thought were quite
solid can actually have some liquid or gaseous components which can
leave into the vacuum of space, changing the properties of the material
and causing it to shrink or become brittle," says Andy Vick, head of
disruptive technology at RAL Space. [Space [weather]{.mark} is another
[major **contributor** to **satellite**]{.mark}
**[failures]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Many of these [bus-sized, multi-ton
satellites are out in GEO, thousands of miles from Earth where there is
little atmospheric protection from extreme conditions and **[large
amounts of radiation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And the [void can be
**surprisingly active** and unpredictable when it comes to **weather.
[X-rays, ultraviolet rays, radiation]{.mark}**[, and **geomagnetic
storms**]{.mark} can all **[wreak havoc]{.mark} on-board**]{.underline};
[[components]{.mark} can be [damaged by the high current that discharges
into the satellite]{.mark} or damaged [by]{.mark} high-[energy
particles]{.mark} that **penetrate the satellite**]{.underline}. [[Space
dust]{.mark} -- literally tiny particles of rock dust -- can hit the
sats and [**become plasma** and **damage
equipment**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Sun Outages]{.underline}]{.mark}[,
where the satellite passes in front of the Sun, don\'t harm the
satellite. However, the sun\'s [**interference swamps the
signal**]{.mark} from the satellite[, causing a **loss of
data**]{.mark}]{.underline}. These outages affect the signals from
geostationary satellites, and can last for around ten minutes a day
during the Equinox - but they are predictable. The University of Reading
recently recorded the first 'space hurricane' which it described as a
'1,000km-wide swirling mass of plasma raining electrons several hundred
kilometers above the North Pole.' [The [most **notorious space
weather**]{.mark} event was the [Carrington Event,]{.mark} a **solar
flare in 1859** that [caused auroras]{.mark} as far south as the
Caribbean, woke people in the night thinking it was morning, and [caused
**telegraph**]{.mark} **lines to [fail]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Smaller
events in [[1989]{.mark} caused blackouts and [communication
failures]{.mark}.]{.underline} A [[Carrington-level event today]{.mark}
would [cause **worldwide electronics failures**]{.mark}, and could
**[wipe out all the satellite]{.mark} networks** of the world if action
wasn't taken ahead of time.]{.underline} In a disaster report, space
insurance consortium Atrium warned a [single anomalously large proton
flare or a number of flares in quick succession from our sun could
result in a loss of power to all satellites in geosynchronous orbit and
cost billions of dollars to fix]{.underline}. Dr. Holger Krag, head of
the Space Safety Programme Office for the European Space Agency, tells
[DCD there is [little that can be done to **protect satellites**
from]{.mark} the impact of a [solar flare]{.mark}]{.underline} beyond
turning off key electrical systems ahead of time. But the
**[[unpredictable nature]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of the sun can [make
this a difficult task]{.mark}]{.underline}. To better predict coronal
ejections from the sun and provide more notice about potential space
weather events, the ESA has planned a mission called Lagrange, where
spacecraft will be positioned at \"Lagrange points\", where the gravity
of the Earth and Sun balance providing stable locations to observe the
sun's activity a few days ahead of the Earth's position. "From \[the
L5\] position, it can see the surface of the sun that would turn towards
Earth three days later. We can see an advanced view of the activity area
on the sun as it's rotating around its axis towards the Earth," says Dr.
Krag. "At the same time, you can have a side view on the line between
Earth and Sun so it can see coronal mass ejection traveling from the Sun
to the Earth and it can measure the velocity of the ejections.\"

#### [Too many]{.underline} groups can cyber-attack satellites\-\--terrorists [certainly]{.underline} have the capability to inflict catastrophic damage

[[Cyberthreats against space]{.underline}]{.mark}-based [[systems may be
classified as]{.mark} follows]{.underline}:

• [[States setting out to create military
advantages]{.underline}]{.mark} in space, or seeking to steal strategic
quantities of intellectual property and having sufficient computing
power to crack encryption codes, for example;

• Often [well-resourced [organized criminal
elements]{.mark}]{.underline} seeking financial gain;

• [[Terrorist groups wishing to promote]{.mark} their [causes, even up
to]{.mark} the [catastrophic]{.mark} level of [satellite
collisions]{.mark} with space debris [including]{.mark} a cascade of
collisions]{.underline} -- called [the [Kessler]{.mark}
Effect]{.underline},23 denying the use of space for all actors;

• [[Individual hackers]{.mark} who]{.underline} simply [want to prove
and fanfare their skills]{.underline};

• [[**Any combinations** of the]{.mark} organizations and individuals
[above]{.mark}]{.underline}.

And their methods would be:24

• Jamming, spoofing and hacking attacks on, for example, communication
networks, by using space infrastructure;

• Attacks on satellites, by targeting their control systems or mission
packages, perhaps taking control of the satellite to exploit its
inherent capabilities, shut it down, alter its orbit (perhaps thereby
'weaponizing' it), or 'cook' or 'grill' its solar cells through
deliberate exposure to damaging levels of highly ionizing radiation;

• Attacks on the ground infrastructure, such as satellite control
centres, the associated networks and data centres, leading to potential
global impacts (for example on weather forecasting systems, which use
large quantities of space-derived data).

International cooperation will be crucial in any response to space-based
cyberthreats, and is at the heart of current debates, for the following
reasons:

• [Large numbers of satellites orbit the Earth]{.underline}, traversing
all territories, [and their [uplinks and downlinks are transmitted via
**ground stations from all around the world**]{.mark}]{.underline};

• These satellites are used worldwide, whether for communications, Earth
observation or precise navigation and timing capabilities;

• [Satellites are built with components from an internationalized supply
chain]{.underline}.

Space is thus no longer a technological playground for the privileged
few countries involved in sending humans to the moon, spying on others
or putting communications leviathans into geostationary orbit.

For some states, there is still the simple allure of national prestige
to be gained by entering the space race, with the successful launch of a
sovereign vehicle being seen as a demonstration of technological
achievement. More importantly, however, [an ever increasing number of
countries and private enterprises are commissioning satellites or buying
timeshares in satellites for an equivalent number of
reasons]{.underline}; and market forces and technological advances are
leading to lower-cost launches, smaller and more reliable satellites,
and satellite constellations that can provide aggregated capability. As
service providers become more aware of how space can be used, they are
looking to satellites to deliver reliable, cheap and persistent
capabilities that support commercial enterprises.

The [[Emergence of **New Actors in Space**]{.mark} The sixty-year-old
paradigm of state-led agencies dominating the space is slowly
[experiencing a shift]{.mark}]{.underline}. The space sector faces a
[swarm of privately owned companies that wish to invest in the
billion-dollar industry]{.underline}. From providing services and
equipment for space missions to space launchers, human spaceflight,
space tourism, and asteroid mining. These companies are working to
develop easier, cheaper, and faster ways to access the space.16A [few
examples of these companies are SpaceX, Scaled Composites, Blue Origin,
Virgin Galactic, Bigelow Aerospace, and the Sierra Nevada
Corporation]{.underline}.The increase in investment in space programs
has led to what one might call the commercialization or privatization of
space. The emergence of new actors in space brings with it the emergence
of new challenges. Unlike before, when a small group of states and big
aerospace industries dominated the space, these new actors are likely to
transform the oldstable system. As mentioned, the [[privatization of
space]{.mark} will [result in a **decrease in** ]{.mark}**the
[cost]{.mark}** of space activities]{.underline}. While this does
promise a sizeable increase in space development, it does have its fair
share of drawbacks. R[eduction in cost [means **increased
participation**]{.mark}. Furthermore if privatization continues at the
same pace, soon it **would [not]{.mark} remain [easy to regulate]{.mark}
or control the [actors]{.mark}** [in space]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hence,
making it [**[easier for terrorist]{.mark} groups [to
participate]{.mark}** in space activities **without attracting too much
[attention]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In addition, [reduced costs will
[allow them to **develop** ]{.mark}**their [capacity]{.mark}** to
participate in sophiscated space activities.]{.underline}

Threat of Terrorism in space: Possibilities and Capabilities [The
[**threat of terrorism** in space]{.mark} was [**highlighted**
by]{.mark} the US Under **[secretary of State]{.mark}**, Robert Joseph,
who warned the public at the George C. Marshall Institute about the
potential terrorist attacks on US space ass]{.underline}ets in 2006.5His
view was in conformity with the US 2006 Space policy, which argues about
the capabilities and possible role played by transnational actors in
interfering with space assets. There are [three widely identified
categories of '[potential terrorist acts]{.mark} in space']{.underline}:
[[measures against satellites]{.mark}, attacks on launch facilities and
ground stations, and user/service equipment attacks]{.underline}. An
[[attack against]{.mark} [satellites]{.mark} or an attempt to hijack
them [can **cripple any state** in today's **digital world** since they
relay on signals]{.mark}]{.underline} around the world and are [used to
operate our televisions, telephones, help in navigations through Global
Positioning System (GPS), weather and climate prediction and
monitoring]{.underline} systems, [detecting underwater minerals, and for
rapid and efficient communication]{.underline}.6 [The **ideal way** to
make affairs of a state on stand-hold]{.underline} would be through
**[[eliminating a satellite communication]{.underline}]{.mark}** in its
uses. However, that can be a difficult task. [Other ways to
[achieve]{.mark} the same objective can be [through disruption, denial,
degradation]{.mark}, and [deception]{.mark}]{.underline} of the space
system. Different satellites have different purposes; military
satellites are better shielded than a commercial satellite. Therefore a
[commercial satellite can be a **suitable target for
terrorists**]{.underline} looking for new methods to achieve their
objective of mass casualties and psychological effects. In advanced and
developed states such as the US, traffic signals are controlled through
cyber and satellite signals. A single [[disruption]{.mark} can
[cause]{.mark} accidents that can have a **[domino
effect]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Eventually it was observed that the
[first step to [attack]{.mark} a satellite is to track it. To do so it
only **[requires minimal technology]{.mark}** such as stopwatches, sky
maps, personal computers, and binoculars]{.underline} to observe a
satellite's orbital element. That's why the [US Undersecretary of State
Robert Joseph showed concern [overnon-governmental]{.mark} satellite
[observers]{.mark} tracking and **[posting]{.mark} [satellite
orbits]{.mark} on the internet**]{.underline},
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[terrorist organizations can
use]{.mark} for achieving their agendas]{.underline}. The simplest way
to disrupt the satellite is through [electronic interference, i.e.
jamming or spoofing the satellite's signals]{.underline}. Jamming means
blocking or disturbing the communication signals travelling to and from
the satellite by producing noise of the same radio frequency within the
field of view of the satellite\'s antennas.7In contrast, spoofing is to
mimic the characteristics of accurate signal so that the users receive a
fake signal.Occurrences of [hijacking and [jamming]{.mark} are becoming
**[increasingly common]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 2006,
[[Thuraya]{.mark} Satellite Telecommunications of Abu Dhabi pinpointed
that **[months-long intentional]{.mark} [jamming]{.mark}** of mobile
satellite was detected to be originating from three different places in
Libya]{.underline} .This major jamming event recorded in commercial
satellite sectors were executed by some Libyan nationals. They were
smuggling Marlboro cigarettes from Chad or Nigerinto Libya and they were
usingThuraya satellite phones8to communicate with each other. They aimed
to disrupt the communication signals to prevent the Libyan officials
from overhearing their conversation. However, [they jammed the signals
on a large scale and ended up **[disrupting]{.mark} the [signals beyond
Libyan borders]{.mark}** as well]{.underline}. As a result, [[Thuraya
**suffered huge losses**]{.mark} as it tried to expand its network by
launching a third satellite]{.underline}. If a [**gang of
[cigerrete]{.mark}** [**smugglers**]{.mark} in Libya **in 2006**
[can]{.mark} have the capability to **[jam]{.mark} the [signals outside
Libyan borders]{.mark}**, it is [alarming]{.mark} to **[imagine what
terrorists can]{.mark} [do]{.mark}**]{.underline} now, 14 years
later.9Sri Lankan Tamil Tigers (LTTE) are declared terrorists by the US
government.10 They [hijacked Intelsat Ltd and used satellite transponder
to broadcast their propaganda across the Indian
subcontinent]{.underline}. Intelsat tried to shutdown LTTE's pirating,
but [[LTTE]{.underline}]{.mark} [continued its [satellite **piracy for
two years**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly in China, China's [Falun
[Gong hijacked]{.mark} the broadcasting signals of **[nine China
Central]{.mark} Television stations**, [and **ten provincial
stations**]{.mark} and broadcasted their agenda of religious
spiritualism in 2002]{.underline}. Later in 2004, they again disrupted
AsiaSat signals for 4 hours.Another way to attack satellites is by
targeting their sensors with lasers. The laser beam can either interfere
with or damage the satellite sensor. Also, it can melt fragile
electronic connections as it induces thermo-mechanical stresses and
structural damages. Moreover, satellites could be targeted as a whole
through energy beams. However, it is a highly technical operation and
requires several elements: reliable booster system with payload
capacity, type of target that affects the delivery, up-to-date
maintenance, and efficient crew, extensive space surveillance and
tracking system, a medium to place the target in the range of the
weapon, ability to kill the target, and ability to determine if the
attack was successful or not. This is dangerous as an attack targeting a
satellite may lead to secondary damages in the space orbitand may also
hit the astronauts.

#### Space terror likely and easy to succeed

Now, the [question arises [why]{.mark} the [space sector]{.mark} would
be an **[attractive target for weak]{.mark} [actors]{.mark}** like
terrorist groups or individuals]{.underline}. A good way to answer it is
to draw an analogy between the space sector and civil aviation because
the latter for decades has been subject to various terrorist attacks. J.
Laskowski names four main reasons why it has been so, i.e[., (1)
[extensive **media coverage**]{.mark}, (2) **[symbolic meaning]{.mark}**
-- by attacking the industry, the terrorist attacks the state the agency
or company is registered]{.underline} in, [(3) [**relative easiness** to
carry out]{.mark} such an attack, and (4) **[severe economic
consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Laskowski, 2013:159-162). We can
extend this list by the ones recognized by J. Harrison, namely that (5)
[such attacks are international events, (6) they can **[generate]{.mark}
a [sense of shame]{.mark}** [among]{.mark} the politicians of the
attacked [state]{.mark}, (7) **[they are
effective]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Harrison, 2012: 49-52). It seems that
the [abovementioned reason could also **apply to the space industry**
and because of the **unique and special character** of it,]{.underline}
like the amount of money involved, its symbolic significance, and
worldwide media coverage, any act of space terrorism would release the
goals the terrorists had in mind and hoped for. This is also why
[**traditionally weak actors** and **[adversaries of]{.mark}** the
states like the **[US]{.mark}**A, Russia, or China [would be]{.mark}
**potentially [interested]{.mark}** [in targeting]{.mark} the
**[space]{.mark} industry** of those countries]{.underline}. For, a
[successful attack, i.e.]{.underline} such that would result in death
and/or [[bring]{.mark} a lot of destruction to the
infrastructure]{.underline}, would be a [**[real blow]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [the country's internal and external
[perception]{.mark}, its [finances]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} would
definitely **slow down** the development of **[space]{.mark}
[exploration]{.mark}**]{.underline} As we can see in figure 1, all the
odds are against strong actors and in favor of the weak ones, like more
or less organized terrorist groups. **Graphics excluded**

#### Weak adversaries particularly likely to pursue space strikes

What is [**more significant** from the safety and security perspective
is the fact that the [space industry]{.mark} has been [gaining]{.mark}
more and **more strategic [importance]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Nowadays,
we **[witness an unprecedented process]{.underline}** [of
democratization of space technologies, including weapons, [that could
become a]{.mark} **[serious threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} for orbital
objects [in the future]{.underline}. Obviously, [[weak
actors]{.underline}]{.mark} are not in possession of ASAT weapon systems
able to destroy satellites in the orbit (as for today, there are just
five nation-states that have that capability, i.e., USA, Russia, China,
Israel, and India); they [do have though **[significant
potential]{.mark}** to [disrupt / jam signals]{.mark} from and to
satellites that may **[turn out to be lethal]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The
[cases of the latter have already happened]{.underline}. For example,
Sri Lankan terrorist group the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
otherwise known as the [[Tamil Tigers, hacked]{.mark} an Intelsat
satellite and used a vacant Ku-band transponder to broadcast its message
in Sri Lanka and the surrounding region **[without Intelsat's knowledge
for over a year]{.mark}**]{.underline} (de Selding, 2007) until Intelsat
decided to shut down the satellite transponder in late April 2007
(McCoy, 2007). There might have also been cases of sabotage. In early
2015, a twenty-year-old U.S. Air Force Defence Meteorological Satellite
Program Flight 13(DMSP-F13) craft blew up. The U.S., according to S.M.
Pekkanen, attributed the event to a power failure and minimized its
importance. However, the delay in admitting the event to the public
caused speculations, whether it was an actual act of sabotage (Pekkanen,
2015). Of course, for obvious reasons, it is difficult to determine what
truly happened. Another case worth mentioning is the [launch of four
rogue satellites on Indian PSLV launch vehicle on 12 January
2018]{.underline}. The [satellites belonged to the Swarm Technologies --
a space start-up based in California that had been denied placing them
onto the orbit]{.underline} due to the small size of the devices (the
concern was that they were too small to be tracked in space)
(Christensen, 2018). [While, as it seems, this case did not pose any
danger for global security]{.underline}, it [raises many questions
regarding our current control system what is sent to the outer
space]{.underline}. If it was possible for an American company to place
in the orbit unlicensed satellites, it seems, that [**any other agent**,
including **[weak]{.mark} actors [adversaries]{.mark}** discussed in
this paper, [could do the same]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"Strengthening crisis management, the most urgent task in current
China--US and China--Japan security relations.\" China International
Strategy Review 3, no. 1 (2021): 34-55. // Ali

First, at present and in the foreseeable future, the focus of [China--US
crisis management should be placed on issues concern[i]{.mark}ng the
Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, and
cyberspace]{.underline}. Among these issues, security frictions in [the
S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea [and on
cybersecurity have emerged as the newest challenges]{.underline} for
China and the US over the past 10 years. When strengthening crisis
management measures, it is necessary to clarify each party's bottom line
as soon as possible. With regard to the Taiwan Strait and the Korean
Peninsula, after long-term consultation, both China and the US have a
clearer idea of the other's bottom line. [The key to crisis avoidance
lies in never crossing one another's bottom line]{.underline}. In the
long run, [the East China Sea and outer space will also become important
areas that require strengthened crisis management.]{.underline}

Second, for the time being, [China and the US should redouble their
efforts to prevent contingencies in the sea or air due to the potential
for misunderstanding, miscalc]{.underline}ulation[,]{.underline} or
accidental discharge of fire. The two sides [must earnestly strengthen
the military maritime consultation mechanism; strictly observe the rules
of conduct for air and maritime encounters]{.underline} in order to
ensure safety, as well as the mechanism of [notification of major
military activities]{.underline} plus the two annexes; and constantly
enrich and improve these rules and mechanisms in practice. To this end,
in addition to holding annual meetings to analyze the overall situation
and evaluate various risks, relevant departments must [strengthen
regular and ad hoc consultations to eliminate hidden
dangers]{.underline} in a timely manner [and minimize security
risks.]{.underline}

Third, while trying to resume and strengthen security and defense
dialogues, the two sides should make crisis management an important item
on their agendas. To this end, they must strive to create conditions to
first [resume]{.underline} the diplomatic and security dialogue (or [the
defense consultation), the joint staffs dialogue]{.underline}, [the
annual meeting of the military maritime consultation, and the law
enforcement and cyber-security dialogue]{.underline}. These dialogues
should cover setting up and [improving bilateral crisis communication
mechanisms, establishing various]{.underline} [c]{.underline}onfidence-
and security-[b]{.underline}uilding [m]{.underline}easure[s (including
codes of conduct [in]{.mark} the sea, air, space, and
[cyber]{.mark}-space]{.underline}), and ways to avoid the militarization
of the South China Sea. In addition, the two sides should work hard to
[launch]{.underline}, as soon as possible, [a strategic stability
dialogue]{.underline}53 [[that focuses]{.mark} on nuc]{.underline}lear
[s]{.underline}trategy[, nuclear development strategy, and related
cyber]{.underline}security [issues, as well as outer space security,
missile defense deployment, and new conventional strategic weapons, and
touches upon crisis stability and
c]{.underline}onfidence-[b]{.underline}uilding [m]{.underline}easure[s
in the nuclear field.]{.underline}

Fourth, [China and the US should explicitly assign a crisis management
function to the head-of-state and defense hotlines and strengthen the
function to ensure the hotlines' role in crisis prevention and
control]{.underline}. To this end, the two sides should try to set up
more frequent phone conversations and allow them to happen on short
notice, thus giving full play to the hotlines' role in exchanging
information promptly, [clarifying intentions, and sending clear
signals]{.underline}. To establish crisis communication more quickly,
the two sides should also seriously consider [establish]{.underline}ing
[a military hotline at the theater level.]{.underline} The various
hotlines may, of course, be used in peacetime, but [their function
during a crisis is critical]{.underline}. The head-of-state hotline did
not serve such a function during the 1999 embassy bombing incident and
the 2001 aircraft collision incident. [This history must not repeat
itself]{.underline}.

Fifth, in addition to the various hotlines, [the two sides should also
give full play to the role of emergency communication through Chinese
and American embassies and special envoys]{.underline}. [The two should
also set up a joint working group to respond to emergencies]{.underline}
and task it with collecting and sharing risk information; discussing
crisis prevention, control, and response plans; engaging in crisis
communication as soon as possible and making recommendations to decision
makers; and carrying out post-crisis review and evaluation. The joint
working group may be placed under the diplomatic and security dialogue
and led directly by the foreign and defense departments.

Sixth, [the top leaders of the two countries and militaries should reach
a common understanding on the basic principles of crisis
management]{.underline}. In the Track 2 dialogue on security crisis
management, experts from the two sides jointly proposed several basic
principles of crisis management, such as "[maintaining direct channels
of communication]{.underline} and sending clear and specific signals",
"[escalating slowly and responding in a tit-for-tat
manner]{.underline}", "acting on interests instead of ideology",
"[[exercis]{.mark}ing restraint in using extreme pressure and avoiding
commitment traps]{.underline}", and "dividing hard-to-resolve disputes
into smaller, more manageable issues and aiming at gradual
resolution"(Zhang and Swaine 2007, 7--10). [If agreed upon and adopted,
these basic principles will serve crisis management between China and
the US well]{.underline}.

Seventh, [China and the US should continue supporting and strengthening
the role of Track 2 dialogues]{.underline}. Over the years, as a
supplement to intergovernmental interactions, dialogues hosted by think
tanks [have played a positive role in helping the two sides conduct
security cooperation, manage differences and crises, reduce
mis-understanding and miscalc]{.underline}ulations[, and increase mutual
trust]{.underline}. Now that [security and defense dialogues between the

various [Track 2 security dialogues]{.underline}, such as the China--US

Fifth, even absent related agreements, [[it is possible to]{.mark}
pursue some measure of mutual restraint in the most dangerous and
volatile areas]{.underline}. On the positive side of the ledger, some
degree of cooperation is possible even when both parties face a security
dilemma, although factors such as offense vs. defense, technology, and
geography must be considered with particular care.43 Yet negotiating
durable agreements under a great-power security dilemma can be extremely
difficult, as both sides have incentives to cheat, and no outside party
can adjudicate effectively.44 Each side's belief that the other will
simply pocket any concessions without reciprocal actions or benefits
strongly disincentivizes unilateral restraint or accommodation.
Fortunately, effective arms control and [deterrence relations need not
be limited to formal treaties; they simply require arranging forces in
such a way that neither side has the incentive to act adversely toward
the other]{.underline}. Thomas Schelling and Morton Halperin's
explication of this issue is worth considering in depth.45 [A broader,
more flexible form of [engagement]{.mark}]{.underline} that applies
Schelling and Halperin's conceptual approach to [focus on reducing the
incentives to use capabilities rather than reducing the capabilities
themselves]{.underline} can thus address U.S. and Chinese concerns that
would render aspects of formal agreements deal-breakers. [[China]{.mark}
appears absolutely unwilling to accept technical inferiority, and any
agreement that attempts to keep the PLA in such a position will
fail;]{.underline} nor will the United States voluntarily relinquish
capabilities that it has labored and invested to develop, particularly
in the face of a security dilemma. [[Informal understandings]{.mark}
may]{.underline} evolve over time through informal communication, and
may even [lead to more explicit agreements.]{.underline}46 The overall
strategic positions of the United States and China are relatively clear;
it may be difficult to justify extensive dialogues that fail to go
beyond policy platitudes. What could be useful to discuss are
operational and perhaps even tactical specifics, which remain far less
clear. [The most realistic possibility to pursue over time
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore [some form of implicit,
non-treaty-based understanding between the United States and China that
even if the use of certain lower-end capabilities may be impossible to
rule out, []{.mark}other [types]{.mark} of capabilities are primarily
for deterrence rather than actual operational use.]{.underline} This
[[would help clarify]{.mark} thresholds, [an]{.mark} important aspect of
risk management]{.underline}.47 As explained previously, however, this
approach will only be effective to the extent that both sides restrain
themselves. It will fail if Beijing expects preemptive or unilateral
concessions from Washington.

[NATO in Cyber and Outer Space]{.underline}

Cyber and space is a promising arena for NATO to address China
challenges by building member state resilience. Like the air and sea
domains, as areas that belong to no one state and which provide access
to much of the globe, they form part of the global commons. Command of
the commons has been the key enabler of the US global position of power
for many decades.26 However, [China wields a **sufficient range** of
**sea**, **air**, **cyber**, and **space** capabilities such that the
**global commons** is now]{.underline} a [contested]{.underline} zone.
In contrast to the sea and air domains, [[cyber and space are sparsely
regulated]{.underline}]{.mark}. This [lack of]{.underline} international
[norms enhances the risk of conflict based on misperception, making
**NATO cooperation pertinent**]{.underline}. Adversarial activities
toward the US and Europe in the cyber and space domain threaten
transatlantic security[. [These come not just from China, but
also]{.mark}]{.underline} from other adversaries such as [[**Russia**
and **Iran**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Mechanisms for addressing these
challenges in the military sector are essentially generic and not, at
least in their basic design, established with a particular country in
mind. Thus[, [cyber and space provide an avenue]{.mark} for NATO [to
contribute]{.mark} **significantly** [to deterrence]{.mark} of China
without]{.underline} having to combat major [internal
resistance]{.underline}. [[NATO would]{.mark} also [benefit from]{.mark}

https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/outer-space-the-new-horizon-on-eus-strategic-autonomy/,
sg

Where is the EU's strategic autonomy in outer space?

[[Space policy]{.mark} is nothing new [to the EU]{.mark}]{.underline},
but it is only [now]{.underline} that [it [has been
given]{.mark}]{.underline} the outlook of **[strategic
[autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, both [[in **markets**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} in **[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
defence. There are two reasons for this. The first is that the European
space industry recorded a €1 billion drop in sales in 2020 (a 13%
decrease year on year), an unprecedented figure in the past 30 years,
according to the leading European association ASD Eurospace. This
explains why Commissioner Breton recently announced the creation of a
comprehensive package of measures:

- The [[launch of]{.mark} the CASSINI **space investment [fund]{.mark}**
  [with]{.mark}]{.underline} an investment capacity of at least [[€1
  billion to support]{.underline}]{.mark} new space
  [start-ups;]{.underline}

- The use of [**public [procurement]{.mark}** in a strategic way [to
  reduce]{.mark}]{.underline} the [commercial [risk
  of]{.mark}]{.underline} new [[trials]{.underline}]{.mark} (test and
  de-risk), [provide security]{.underline} to start-ups and build
  confidence [[with]{.mark} **private [investors]{.mark}**]{.underline}
  in space projects;

- The [development]{.underline} of a technology roadmap [[with
  long-term]{.mark} plans and [investments]{.mark}]{.underline}
  coordination in space innovation [through a **Space
  Partnership**;]{.underline}

- [Greater [communication between]{.mark} all **industrial
  [sectors]{.mark}** [working on space]{.mark}]{.underline} capabilities
  through the Space Launcher Industry Alliance and the Space Traffic
  Management Strategy. [This is]{.underline} not only about space
  companies, but also [about dependences on the **supply
  chains**]{.underline} from other industries, such as semiconductors,
  or industries [which may impinge on]{.underline} European [leadership
  over space]{.underline}, such as quantum technology.

The **[[second pillar]{.underline}]{.mark}** of measures [[touches on
security]{.underline}]{.mark} and defence. The launch [announcement of a
Strategy on Defence and Space]{.underline} in 2023 and the integration
of more space issues into the expected Strategic Compass are positive
news due to the urgency of this topic, but also because they represent a
major evolution with respect to previous strategies. The [2000 strategy
addressed how to improve **scientific knowledge**]{.underline}, foster
its benefits to society and how to strengthen the space market. Next
strategies from 2011 and 2016 made reference to security issues, but
mainly for civilian affairs. As of 2022, [[Borrell]{.underline}]{.mark}
has [[committed to developing]{.underline}]{.mark} new mechanisms to
respond to a [[space]{.underline}]{.mark} which is likely [[to become a
battlefield]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [idea is to focus on space domain
awareness,]{.underline} the [[reinforcement of]{.mark} dual-use **space
[infrastructures]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a Galileo Threat Response
Mechanism, and a first joint exercise by March 2022, among others.
Additionally, [space was included]{.underline} for the first time [as a
critical infrastructure]{.underline} in the latest proposal for the
Directive on the Resilience of Critical Entities.

There is no doubt that the [[EU has positioned]{.mark} outer [space as a
**new asset** on]{.mark} its strategic autonomy's horizon]{.underline}.
There are still many issues to be discussed, resolved and even opened
up. Some are: how to tackle the use of space data markets to increase
the economic [[competitiveness]{.mark} of **European
companies**]{.underline} and greater collaboration with each other; the
need to carry out a [mapping on **existing
[assets]{.mark}**]{.underline}, dependences and shortcomings in several
project scenarios which are significant, critical or vital to assess and
ensure the [resilience of **[supply chains]{.mark}** for **space
capabilities**]{.underline}; which [cooperation instruments should exist
between **member states**]{.underline}, the EU
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the European Space Agency to make sure
funding for innovation is impactful; [[how to cooperate for]{.mark} a
**joint response** to **security** and [**defence**
threats]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. [following]{.underline} the
**[cyber]{.underline}**-diplomacy model on coordinated attribution at

policy with other plans in semiconductors, quantum technology and
cyberspace, among others.

preexisting]{.mark} bilateral [arrangements]{.mark} for sharing
information]{.underline}, such as in the cooperation between the
respective national CERTs from the two countries. However, what
[[arrangements]{.underline}]{.mark} are [now [in place **do not

and avert explosive incidents]{.underline} especially in the political
and military spheres. [Blocking communications and blinding

as high level]{.mark} [decisionmakers]{.mark} with corresponding
political/policy guidance to endow them with real
substance]{.underline}.

It is also worth considering in this context how to apply the MOU on
Notification of Major Military Activities in cyberspace. In this
memorandum, signed by the U.S. Defense Department and Chinese Ministry
of National Defense in November 2014, [[both sides "affirm their
aspiration to establish a voluntary foundation for notifications]{.mark}
of major military activities]{.underline}, such as exchange information
voluntarily about their respective country's security policy, strategy,
and legal information, including the adjustment of respective national
defense policies and strategy, by providing briefings and information
about speeches, major government publications such as White Papers,
strategy publications, and other official announcements related to
policy and strategy," [and allow for "observation of military exercises
and activities]{.underline} that should be voluntary and occur within
the existing framework of bilateral U.S.-China military relations."33
[[Similar voluntary exchange]{.mark} of information, interpretation of
cyber strategy and publication, and invitation from either side to
observe cyber exercises]{.underline} hosted or co-hosted by the other
side [[could be one part of confidence-building efforts in
cyberspace]{.underline}.]{.mark}

## Terrestrial CP

### 1NC -- CP

#### Overreliance on Satellite-based GPS makes NATO vulnerable to Russian attack. Only terrestrial systems as backups solve.

**Goward '22** (Dana A. Goward,  president of Resilient Navigation &
Timing Foundation. "Get the Bullseye Off GPS" 04/19/22,
<https://spacenews.com/op-ed-get-the-bullseye-off-gps/>)

On Nov.15, 2021, a missile streaked into space from Russia. Once above
the atmosphere, it released a kinetic kill vehicle that destroyed a
retired Russian satellite. The resulting debris endangered other
satellites and the International Space Station, including the Russian
members of its crew. 

A week later Russian troops massed along the border with Ukraine. A
Russian news commentator recognized as [[Putin's
mouthpiece]{.mark}[[ bragged that Russia could destroy all]{.mark} 32
[US]{.mark} Global Positioning System
[(GPS)]{.mark}](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/220404_Harrison_SpaceThreatAssessment2022.pdf?K4A9o_D9NmYG2Gv98PxNigLxS4oYpHRa)[ satellites
and blind NATO forces.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

This was a particularly ominous warning. 

U.S. [[critical infrastructure relies on]{.underline}]{.mark} precise
timing and navigation signals from [[GPS
satellites]{.underline}]{.mark}. At a December public meeting, a member
of the National Security Council summed this up by[ saying "GPS is still
a single point of
failure"](https://www.gpsworld.com/nsc-director-gps-still-a-single-point-of-failure/#:~:text=The%252520Global%252520Positioning%252520System%252520(GPS,director%252520for%252520Response%252520and%252520Resilience.) for
America.

If GPS signals suddenly disappeared, transportation systems would
immediately suffer. Everything would slow down, carry less capacity, and
be more dangerous. Air travel would be less efficient and safe. Delivery
services would be hamstrung. Uber and Lyft would be out of business.  

Other critical systems would follow over subsequent days. Cellphone
towers and internet switches would lose synchronization. Banks could not
timestamp transactions. Control systems for electrical grids, sewer and
water systems, and many industrial applications would fail or revert to
inefficient manual operations.

And, of course, Putin would not even need not go through the trouble of
shooting down satellites and risking all-out war. He could do it with
the flip of a switch.

Russia excels at cyber and electronic warfare. State media has boasted
of Russia's ability to[ make aircraft carriers
useless](https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Russian_E_Warriors_Render_Aircraft_Carriers_Useless_999.html).
[Russian forces regularly jam GPS and other satellite
signals]{.underline} in various parts of the world. [They]{.underline}
also have [perfected "spoofing," sending false signals to make GPS users
think they are someplace they are not.]{.underline} 

[[Russian]{.underline}]{.mark} capabilities also reportedly extend into
space with[[ [nuclear-powered electronic warfare
satellites]{.mark}](https://www.thespacereview.com/article/3809/1).]{.underline}
These [could [jam GPS signals across]{.mark} the face of [the
planet.]{.mark}  ]{.underline}

A cyber or jamming attack would have clear advantages over destroying
satellites. Cyber-attacks are often difficult to attribute and would be
less likely to prompt a shooting war. Putin also would have the
flexibility to undo things if they started to get out of hand, or once
he got what he wanted. 

Protecting GPS satellites and signals is essential to U.S. national and
economic security. And to keep our national policy and global leadership
from being held hostage by threats.

[[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} have recently [[opined]{.underline}]{.mark}
in SpaceNews and other publications that the [[solution is more and
better GPS]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is true that a modernized and
capable GPS is essential. 

Yet [[more of the same]{.mark} is [unlikely to fix]{.mark} the
[problem]{.mark}. The [most effective]{.mark} and [least expensive
solution is to make GPS]{.mark} a much [less attractive
target]{.mark}]{.underline}. 

America's over-dependence on GPS for essential positioning, navigation,
and timing (PNT) services has long been recognized. To help manage the
problem, in 2004 President Bush mandated the [[establishment of an
alternative]{.mark} and backup [system for GPS]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Administrations promised
in[ 2008](https://rntfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/DHS-Press-Release-GPS-Backup-2008.pdf) and[ 2015](https://rntfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/DSD-and-Dep-DOT-reply-to-Mr.-Garamendi.pdf) to
do so. In 2018 a[[ law was enacted requiring a [terrestrial
backup]{.mark} for
GPS](https://www.gpsworld.com/gps-to-get-terrestrial-backup-system/) ]{.underline}by
the end of 2020. Each time, though, a lack of perceived real threat and
bureaucratic inertia resulted in no action being taken. 

[[Russia has]{.mark} a [terrestrial PNT]{.mark} system [it]{.mark}s
civilians and military [can use when signals from space are not
available. So
do[ China](https://www.gpsworld.com/china-leads-world-with-plan-for-comprehensive-pnt/),[ South
Korea](https://www.gpsworld.com/south-korea-partners-with-broadcaster-on-eloran-and-10-cm-gps/),
Iran,]{.mark} and [Saudi Arabia.]{.mark}]{.underline}

We shut ours down in 2010. 

And so, our GPS, and our way of life, remain hostage to those better
prepared to survive severe solar storms, accidents, and malicious
attacks of all kinds. 

In a[ January 2021 report to
Congress](https://www.gpsworld.com/dot-report-l-band-uhf-lf-and-fiber-pnt-needed-to-protect-us/),
the Department of Transportation identified the technologies and
services needed to make GPS, and thus America, more secure. It offered a
user-focused systems engineering approach that included signals from
space, terrestrial transmitters, and fiber. 

All these are readily available as mature commercial services. And the
projected annual price tag to contract for them is a small fraction of
the \$1.5B spent on GPS each year. 

PNT is critical tech infrastructure. Expanding and securing our national
PNT capability could easily be included and funded as a project in
the recently enacted Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework.

While GPS satellites and services are at risk from threats like severe
solar weather and human error, the greatest risk is undoubtedly from
malicious acts by other nations, terrorists, criminal organizations, and
hackers.

[Providing GPS alternatives will help protect satellites and signals by
making them much less attractive targets. [Why attack a system if it's
not a single point of failure?]{.mark} Or if users have alternatives
operating in parallel or they can switch to in an instant? ]{.underline}

GPS and the American people must be protected. We have the legal
mandates and funding mechanisms in place. All we need is for the
administration to follow the[ 2018
law](https://www.gpsworld.com/gps-to-get-terrestrial-backup-system/) and
get the bullseye off GPS as soon as possible.

### 2NC -- satellites bad

#### Satellites suck -- their ever-increasing presence leads to collisions, which would take out the grid, GPS systems, and the internet.

**Demiyanov, '22** (Andrey Demiyanov, Jordan News Reporter. "Kessler
Syndrome: An existential wave of doom across the horizon?" 09/01/22
https://www.jordannews.jo/Section-129/Technology/Kessler-Syndrome-An-existential-wave-of-doom-across-the-horizon-11705)

Knowing just how dangerous space debris can be and its century-long
orbital decay, let's now dive into the deep rabbit hole that is
modern-day's tech giant's aspirations to launch more satellites into
space.\
\
[[We have launched over 12,170 satellites into
space]{.underline}]{.mark}; 7,630 are currently in orbit at varying
orbits. Of those 7,630 there are over 3,000 inactive satellites,
essentially space junk, hovering around the earth's atmosphere cruising
around at speeds of 27,500km per hour or more. \
\
Elon Musk, the modern-day layman's hero of space exploration, has set
forth a plan to put over 1,300 satellites into space to establish a
satellite internet network that would enable even the most distanced
individuals across the earth to gain access to the internet. \
\
Jeff Bezos has also set his sights on launching satellites into space to
gain access to the developing industry of satellite internet, and there
are currently [[over a dozen companies]{.mark} that are [seeking to do
the same]{.mark}]{.underline}. \
\
While the notion of internet access for all at an affordable rate
throughout the world with a satellite dish sounds appealing --- how far
are can we push the envelope before Kessler's model starts ringing the
alarms? \
\
While many would argue it is essential to do so, the measure of sending
out hundreds, if not thousands of satellites into orbit by these
companies to simply provide a need that in theory can be provided
through other means seems highly irrational when considering the
long-term effects that this innovation may develop. \
\
[Access to the internet, however, is just one side of the coin ---
countless telecommunication [companies]{.mark}, [government]{.mark}
entities, and other [stakeholders]{.mark} vested in the use of orbital
bodies are continuously [pushing Kessler's model further]{.mark} and
further [into the red]{.mark}, wherein in the coming future, we may
begin to genuinely have to worry about the aforementioned domino
effect. \]{.underline}
\
The real problem \
\
Hypothetically[, [if the Kessler Syndrome becomes a
reality]{.mark}]{.underline} and a chain of collisions to commence, the
earth won't exactly be bombarded with debris like in a sci-fi movie
where the entire planet has fiery fail raining down on its residents. \
\
However, it will mean that [[hundreds of services that rely on
satellite]{.mark} technologies [will come to a]{.mark} complete
[standstill.]{.mark} \
\]{.underline}
Life without [[internet, telecommunications, or]{.mark} even basic
[GPS]{.mark}]{.underline} will become a reality. Launching further
satellites into space will become extremely challenging, and space
exploration may, in fact, be reasonably impacted as a result of the
debris that will be left hovering thousands of kilometers over the
earth. \
\
Kessler admitted that the chance of the collision is currently sitting
at almost null percent back in 2009. The harsh reality is that ever
since then, [satellite launches have increased significantly, therefore
[increasing]{.mark} the total [number of cosmic bodies making their
rounds around the earth.]{.mark} \
\]{.underline}
And it appears that unless genuine exploration into the topic is
performed and regulation is put into place[, [Kessler's
Syndrome]{.mark}]{.underline} won't just be a hypothetical reality ---
but an inevitable [[time bomb that will]{.mark} eventually [set
humanity]{.mark} back [into the dark ages.]{.mark} \]{.underline}
\
While the obvious solution at first glance may be to clean out space of
such debris, not only is it highly costly but there is no rational way
to determine what debris is potentially on its way to set off a
collision chain and what debris can be left alone. Therefore, the only
method to the madness is developing powerful enough systems that can
measure trajectories of most, if not all, known space debris around the
earth --- and then mapping out their trajectories years ahead to predict
what objects may pose a threat in the forthcoming future. \
\
But even that, in essence, is impossible. As mentioned, the earth's
gravitational pull extends hundreds of light-years, albeit at a
significantly reduced strength. \
\
Considering that we have several planets in our solar system, all of
which have their own gravitation fields that indirectly affect the
trajectories of these objects, it becomes nearly impossible to
accurately predict any kind of potential future. \
\
Perhaps, in the end, [[the only]{.mark} real [way to prevent
Kessler's]{.mark} model from ever being realized [is to]{.mark} simply
[limit the number of]{.mark} total [space objects
themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps tech enterprises must stop
chasing the great and instead strive to do good.

What can space asset organizations do? [[Organizations developing space
assets are]{.mark} **largely [unregulated for cybersecurity]{.mark}**
purposes.]{.underline} The lack of specific space asset cybersecurity
requirements necessitates a considerable degree of self-policing.
Without mandatory standards, space asset organizations can improve their
security either individually or collectively. [What follows are some
options to consider: • Employ existing cybersecurity standards and
**develop new standards for space systems** where needed.]{.underline}
There is no lack of cybersecurity standards and best practices available
for developers to follow when attempting to design and develop secure
systems[.]{.underline} Many of these standards, like the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework,
are well-documented and widely adopted in some form.28 [Most [**space
systems' security** can benefit from]{.mark} using these
[standards]{.mark}. In some cases, these standards may not apply for the
specific technologies used in space systems. [For]{.mark} these
[systems]{.mark}, space asset organizations should [create new **space
asset-specific standards**]{.mark} and best practices [so that security
can be applied]{.mark} consistently across the
organization.]{.underline} Vendors of space asset organizations should
also be held to these standards. This should involve the explicit
testing and demonstration that vendors to these organizations conform to
the security standard in place for the space asset organization. •
[**[Establish cybersecurity capabilities for mission systems]{.mark}**
and internal network/server systems.]{.underline} Similarly to what was
done at NASA JPL, it is important to establish separate cybersecurity
specialists for mission systems and internal networks/server systems.
The distinction between the two systems are operational technology
versus information technology---each one has very different operating
and security requirements and need to be addressed accordingly. 28
Nicole Cieslak. "NIST Cybersecurity Framework Adoption on the Rise."
Tenable. 2016. https://www.
tenable.com/blog/nist-cybersecurity-framework-adoption-on-the-rise. [To
date, [congress has provided **little guidance**]{.mark} in terms of
**enabling cybersecurity across sectors**.]{.underline} One of the few
examples includes the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) which
was signed into law in late 2015 by President Obama. CISA is meant to
help facilitate information sharing between the government and the
private sector by limiting the liability of the private sector for
certain attack disclosure.29 [**[Congress should develop more
laws]{.mark}** that could be specifically **relevant to space assets.**
Recommendations concerning these laws follows.]{.underline} • This is
Urgent. Act quickly. Be proactive, not reactive. Do not wait to pass a
law on space cybersecurity until there is a WannaCry (major ransomware
attack that compromised healthcare systems around the world) or Mirai
(IoT attack that took down a major DNS provider on the East Coast
resulting in downtime for websites such as Facebook, Twitter and Reddit)
equivalent for Space. [It seems that action only occurs when a disaster
strikes. A space cyberattack can have serious consequences as detailed
previously and we cannot wait until something happens to pass
legislation protecting these critical systems. • **[Clarify critical
infrastructure security requirements]{.mark}** to include underlying
systems. [Current]{.mark}ly, [policy]{.mark} **concerning critical
infrastructure security** [does not require third-party]{.mark},
enabling [infrastructure to]{.mark} also [comply with]{.mark} the same
[requirements. Space systems should be held **to the same
standards**]{.mark} of the critical infrastructure on which they
rely.]{.underline} • [[**Assign responsibility and liability for
cyber**. Cybersecurity]{.mark} responsibility and associated
[liability]{.mark} for a breach [should be clarified]{.mark} and
assigned for space asset organizations.]{.underline} An important
component of cybersecurity legislation currently under review concerns
the liability of technology developers, owners and operators. In January
2017, the FTC sued D-Link for the vulnerability in their routers leading
to the widespread Mirai botnet attack in October 2016.30 This was the
first time a manufacturer was sued for the cybersecurity failures of
their devices. [**[Legal guidance]{.mark} concerning where liability
falls** [will encourage the]{.mark} responsible [party to]{.mark} take
the **necessary measures** to [secure]{.mark} their [systems. Today's
**lack of clarity**]{.mark} around liability for the space asset
ecosystem [results in]{.mark} poor accountability and inaction to secure
these important systems. • [Make space asset
**org**]{.mark}anization**[s]{.mark}** [accountable]{.mark} for
cybersecurity. All [government contracts]{.mark} with space asset
organizations [should require the contractor to comply with]{.mark}
**key performance parameters** ([KPPs]{.mark}) pertaining to
cybersecurity.]{.underline} Today, cybersecurity KPPs are a subcomponent
of system survivability KPPs. Cybersecurity KPPs should be firmly
enforced for all government contracts. • Expand 32 CFR 236 to include
space asset organizations. [Currently, the defense industrial base is
required to report all cyber incidents that have affected or could
affect national security under the Department of Defense-Defense
Industrial Base Cybersecurity Activities Regulation31. Considering the
critical posture of space systems and the U.S. reliance on these assets
for both national security and critical infrastructure, space asset
organizations should be included under this ruling. [This would improve
cybersecurity transparency]{.mark} **between the government and space
asset organizations.**]{.underline} • [[Establish a]{.mark} **Space
System Information Sharing and Analysis Center**
([ISAC]{.mark}).]{.underline} Government agencies such as the Department
of Homeland Security (DHS) could play a crucial role as a convener for
public and private sector entities that work with space systems. [[The
DHS could become **a**]{.mark}n **important [facilitator]{.mark} for
this sector's** efforts to improve cybersecurity by creating a Space
System Information Sharing and Analysis Center.]{.underline} The DHS
should require participation of government agencies that work with space
systems ranging from the Department of Defense (DoD) to NASA to
participate in the Space System ISAC. [This would [provide an
**incentive for private**]{.mark} **sector space asset
[org]{.mark}anization[s to]{.mark} also [join]{.mark}**. If 32 CFR 236
were expanded to include space asset organizations, the Space System
ISAC could be made compulsory through this requirement.]{.underline}
Sharing threat information across space system agencies and space asset
organizations would be a logical step to improve the security posture of
the sector. Some agencies or private organizations may be much further
ahead in securing systems than others and sharing insights will help all
ISAC members involved. What can a Space System ISAC do? [**[Sharing
threat information]{.mark}** across space system agencies and space
asset organizations [would]{.mark} be a logical step to [improve]{.mark}
the [security posture]{.mark} of the sector. Some agencies or private
organizations may be much further ahead in securing systems than others
and **sharing insights will [help all ISAC members]{.mark}**
involved.]{.underline} The recommendations for what a Space System ISAC
should are as follows. • Encourage collaboration among space-relevant
organizations. The DHS should require participation of government
agencies that work with space systems ranging from the Department of
Defense (DoD) to NASA to participate in the Space System ISAC. This
would provide an incentive for private sector space asset organizations
to also join. If 32 CFR 236 were expanded to include space asset
organizations, the Space System ISAC could be made compulsory through
this requirement. Sharing threat information across space system
agencies and space asset organizations would be a logical step to
improve the security posture of the sector. Some agencies or private
organizations may be much farther ahead in securing systems than others
and sharing insights will help all ISAC members. • [**[Establish
information sharing req]{.mark}**uirement**[s]{.mark}**. The Space
System ISAC should [require member entities to disclose vulnerability
and attack information]{.mark} to one another within a predefined
period.]{.underline} This would be in the spirit of the UK's General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that requires an organization to
disclose when personally identifiable information is breached within 72
hours of discovery. • [**[Document]{.mark} and maintain space system
cybersecurity [best practices]{.mark} and standards**. Member
organizations should [share]{.mark} internal or contractor
[standards]{.mark} for cybersecurity in a manner that does not release
sensitive information.]{.underline} A master list of best practices
should be shared across the Space System ISAC and curated. Member
organizations can comment on the merits of the best practices and cater
existing cybersecurity standards to be highly relevant to the
idiosyncrasies of space systems. • Cooperate with ISACs for other
critical infrastructure sectors that rely on space systems. Because
space systems underpin other sectors, certain threat information for
space systems should be shared with the relevant sectors that might be
affected if an attack occurs. [The Space System ISAC should [work
with]{.mark} the [oil/gas, electricity]{.mark} and emergency services
ISAC [to communicate threats]{.mark} that are relevant to these critical
infrastructure and services. The potentially affected [critical
**infra**]{.mark}structure **[org]{.mark}**anization**[s]{.mark}** could
[then work with]{.mark} the [space]{.mark} asset
**[org]{.mark}**anization**[s]{.mark}** [to remediate]{.mark} the
[vulnerability]{.mark} where appropriate.]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Cyber Sanctions

#### Counterplan: The United States federal government should adopt a policy of unilateral cyber sanctions.

#### Unilateral cyber sanctions solves [all of their internal links]{.underline}\-\--best mode of deterrence.

They Here to Stay?",

\\\\SYang

[[When]{.mark} international [cooperation fails]{.mark} to take root,
[unilateralism blossoms]{.mark} -- as we see in the field of
cybersecurity. [Unilateral cyber sanctions are restrictive economic
measures]{.mark} of a temporary nature [imposed against]{.mark}
individuals, legal [entities]{.mark}, government bodies and officials
[that conduct]{.mark} or facilitate [cyber-attacks]{.mark} or engage in
other malicious cyber activities. They are imposed [without]{.mark} any
prior [authorization of a]{.mark} regional or an [international
organization]{.mark}, i.e., according to states' domestic
laws.]{.underline}

[[The 2014 cyber-attack]{.mark} on Sony Pictures Entertainment, as a
result of which private data, including unreleased movies, was stolen
and emails were hacked as well as thousands of confidential documents
were leaked, [paved the way for]{.mark} the US [cyber sanctions]{.mark}
targeting North Korea, thus adding pressure to one of the most
sanctioned countries in the world. In the following years, [the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [expanded]{.mark} its [cyber
sanctions]{.mark} framework and used it to sanction malicious actors as
well as states sponsoring them.]{.underline}

The European Union introduced a new framework for cyber sanctions in
2019 and the first cyber sanctions were announced in July 2020. Several
non-EU member states expressed their desire to align with the EU cyber
sanctions. The United Kingdom closely follows the EU cyber sanctions and
enacted the Cyber Sanctions Regulations, which came into force on the
exit day.

Leaving aside the politically salient debate on the legality of
unilateral economic sanctions, the next paragraphs are devoted to the
analysis of international law obligations that unilateral cyber
sanctions may breach. A more in-depth analysis can be found here.

[The existing cyber sanctions [target government bodies]{.mark} as well
as senior government officials and thus may entail freezing of
government bodies' assets along with travel bans on senior government
officials.]{.underline} Freezing of government bodies' assets may in
theory violate the customary international law of state immunity, yet it
is debatable. In particular, whether state property benefits from the
enforcement immunity irrespective of the existence of a court proceeding
is unsettled. Travel bans preventing senior government officials from
fulfilling their functions encroach on the immunities guaranteed to such
officials under international law, but this immunity entitlement is only
guaranteed to the officials who represent the government and hence
travel to other states for that purpose.

The consistency of unilateral cyber sanctions with the minimum due
process rights may be questioned. For example, persons targeted under
the EU cyber sanctions regime are guaranteed the right to good
administration, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial,
which are enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European
Union. These guarantees are frequently invoked in disputes questioning
the EU economic sanctions. Besides due process rights, other possible
grounds to question the legality of unilateral cyber sanctions are the
right to property, the right for family and private life and a
prohibition of attacks on honour and reputation that are guaranteed
under various international human rights treaties as well as domestic
laws.

[Against this backdrop, [states may]{.mark} advance an [argu]{.mark}ment
that [cyber sanctions are justified]{.mark} as countermeasures. Indeed,
states are allowed to [impose countermeasures]{.mark} if certain
preconditions are met.]{.underline} First and foremost, there should be
a previous violation of international law, which is remedied by
countermeasures. Second, such violation should be attributed to a state.
Third, countermeasures should not affect obligations for the protection
of fundamental human rights. Furthermore, countermeasures should be
proportional, temporary and adopted only after the procedural
prerequisites were fulfilled. Even a shallow analysis demonstrates that
the possibility to justify cyber sanctions as countermeasures is
hindered by two main hurdles: the lack of internationally agreed
obligations regulating malicious behaviour in cyberspace and the
attribution of cyberattacks to a state under the rules of state
responsibility.

Unilateral cyber sanctions may also violate bilateral agreements of
economic nature and WTO commitments. By imposing unilateral cyber
sanctions that either entail a complete economic boycott of sanctioned
persons, as it is the case with the US cyber sanctions, or prohibit the
provision of funds and economic resources to sanctioned individuals and
entities as the EU regulations prescribe, states are blatantly acting in
contradiction to their professed WTO commitments. Whether such actions
can be justified either under national security exceptions embedded in
bilateral agreements or under the WTO national security clause is
debatable. Moreover, cyber sanctions, such as freezing of assets,
property and interests in property can result in legal claims of
indirect expropriation, violation of the Fair and Equitable Treatment
and other standards of treatment incorporated in international
investment agreements.

[On a normative value of [cyber sanctions]{.mark}, they may [signal "red
lines" of unacceptable behaviour]{.mark} in cyberspace and in such a way
[contribute towards the formulation of rules]{.mark} on responsible
behaviour in cyberspace.]{.underline}

[Given the ever-growing digitalization of all aspects of life and a
steadily increasing number of cyber-attacks, it is expected that
[states]{.mark} would [increasingly rely upon unilateral cyber sanctions
to deter and punish]{.mark} cyber-attacks as well as their
[perpetrators]{.mark}. In this context, one may ponder what role is left
for multilateralism when society is faced with imminent threats and
there is a lack of effective international cooperation and whether in
such circumstances [unilateralism should be]{.mark} discussed and
[explored more]{.mark} openly?]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Solves Allies

#### Solves their internal links about attacks on allied countries\-\--US unilateral action enables it to act as a cyber framework nation for allies and causes follow-on.

https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/resrep03691.8.pdf \\\\SYang

[In a conflict, [**cyber security** will be]{.mark} as or more
[important]{.mark} in forward theaters as it will be [in the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates. Most US allies and partners do
not have the same cyber capabilities as DoD, yet it will be their
infrastructures and national capabilities that US forces will be relying
upon for numerous tasks.]{.underline} [Accordingly, the concept of
"[**extended cyber deterrence**" will be]{.mark} an [important]{.mark}
role [for the DoD]{.mark} in connection with each of the theaters noted
above.]{.underline} The concepts are set forth in the issue brief
"Cyber, Extended Deterrence, and ATO,"90 but their application goes
beyond NATO to all arenas where US critical interests are intertwined
with allies and partners. [Most obviously, [the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [will]{.mark} continue to [develop
**doctrine**]{.mark} **and capabilities** to provide [for]{.mark} the
effective use of [cyberspace]{.mark} in a conflict [as part of
**US**]{.mark} **war-fighting [capabilities]{.mark}**. As noted above,
cyber tools potentially could disrupt an adversary's **communications,
logistics, sensors**, and **military supporting
infrastructure**.]{.underline} The secretary of defense has stated that
cyber is currently being used in the conflict with ISIS,91 and NATO has
recently designated cyber an operational domain.92 Cyber will continue
to be integrated into combat planning. Cyber security will be important
not only for US forward forces, but also for the militaries and the
critical infrastructures of host nations. It is notable that in each of
the theaters that the United States plans for, the potential adversary
has been identified as the source of significant cyber intrusions.
Russia is responsible for the hacking of the Democratic National
Committee, among many other cyber incidents.93 China is responsible for
the attack on the Office of Personnel Management and Chinese officers
have been indicted for continued cyber espionage.94 Iran is behind the
tack on Saudi Arabia's oil company and Iranian hackers have been
indicted for attacks on American banks.95 North Korea is behind the
attack on Sony and has regularly attacked South Korean networks.96 [What
these attacks demonstrate is the **vulnerability of host nations** to
cyberattack, a vulnerability that could significantly undercut
deterrence or the capacity of the United States and its allies and
partners to prevail in a conflict. [To mitigate]{.mark} such
[vulnerability, three]{.mark} key [elements should be used: First, the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [needs to act as a "**cyber
framework nation**]{.mark}" to support host nation
capabilities.]{.underline} This would involve the establishment,
transfer, training, and support of cyber capabilities to enhance
protection, resilience, and restoration. For example, the United States
could help a less cyber-capable ally establish an effective intrusion
protection system, provide forensic support, and develop resilience
capabilities to be utilized in the event of an attack by an adversary.
There are several ways to undertake such efforts but one of the most
useful would be to utilize the National Guard's State Partnership
Program. The program pairs state National Guard units with seventy-six
countries.97 As noted above, the National Guard is substantially
increasing its cyber capabilities, including its focus on critical
infrastructures. That expertise can be utilized in working with allies
and partners in conjunction with the relevant combatant command. The
National Guard's partnership efforts can build on what the NMTs and the
National Guard are doing in the United States, adapted, of course, to
the particulars of the host nation. The National Guard could also be
part of an initiative to provide "fly away" cyber-warfare teams to
provide host nation states' "blue team" assistance to "operate in
degraded environments," including providing malware forensics and
recovery/restoration support. In addition to the National Guard, the DoD
Cyber Crime Center (DC3) could have a valuable international role. DC3's
current mission revolves around five focus areas: digital forensics,
cyber training, technical solutions, Defense Industrial Base (DIB)
cybersecurity, and analytics.98 Like the Guard, DC3 provides tremendous
depth and breadth of support; applied to international requirements it
could enhance a greater USG role through a modest budget. DC3's mission
could be expanded to support extended cyber deterrence, especially in
the areas of building greater allied cyber resilience. Key elements
could include growing international training and information-sharing
programs for allies (similar to ongoing programs with DIB companies in
the United States). Second, associated with US assistance, [[it will be
important]{.mark} for the host nation [to **establish operational
partnerships**]{.mark} with key private entities, including **ISPs and
power grid operators**. As discussed in the context of the United
States, military, telecommunications, and electrical grid operators
should help create, in advance, capabilities that would mitigate a
high-end attack.]{.underline} The United States, as a cyber framework
nation, would help the host nation organize for this effort. Depending
on the theater, it may be important to undertake such efforts on a
regional, as opposed to a national, basis. Again, the United States will
be well positioned to help create the necessary regional activities.
[Third, host [nations will need to undertake **steps comparable
to**]{.mark} **those identified for [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates**. These [include • identifying
**highest-priority**]{.mark} **national military [cyber
asset]{.mark}**[s]{.mark} and supporting telecom and power grid networks
that would need to be protected; • **[extending]{.mark}/enhancing
automated [intrusion protection]{.mark}** and developing resilience
efforts, starting with data classification and segmentation, to
participating host nations' militaries, telecommunication companies, and
electrical grids. It will be important to utilize high-end protection
capabilities, such as multi-factor authentication, end-to-end data
encryption, and diverse and redundant networks to ensure best
information ssurance practices in data confidentiality, integrity, and
availability; • **[increasing detection capabilities]{.mark}** by
provisioning shared cyber threat intelligence capabilities. A cyber
threat intelligence capability would develop and share cyber indications
and warnings regarding the movement of high-end state cyberthreat
activity towards host nation networks and information assets; and •
**[develop]{.mark}ing [cyber defense "playbooks]{.mark}**" and training
exercises for cyber-attack response, with techniques, tactics, and
procedures (TTPs) developed to maximize the value of the defense and
resilience capabilities noted above. [National]{.mark} **grid and
telecommunications [partners in the private sector ]{.mark}**[would be
included]{.mark} as part of the playbook TTPs and training
exercises]{.underline}. As previously discussed by the authors:
"Initially, the cyber framework nation can help to establish or enhance
an existing national framework. Over time, simulations, exercises, and
information sharing will help direct and prioritize other efforts by
exposing gaps and opportunities. Joint exercises, when effective,
usually result in some degree of information sharing. [[Explicit]{.mark}
and incidental [**information sharing**, especially **between private
and public sector**]{.mark} partners, [will be]{.mark} a
[critical]{.mark} requirement if operational protection and/or
resilience is to be achieved]{.underline}. Each country should pick a
model it finds compatible, but the keys are a combination of speed and
full interchange. [[In the US]{.mark}, one of [the most effective
model]{.mark}s [is the]{.mark} '**Information Sharing and Analysis
Center** ([ISAC]{.mark}), a nonprofit organization that provides a
central resource for gathering information on cyber threats to critical
infrastructure and providing two-way sharing of information between the
private and public sector.]{.underline}' ISACs are typically developed
around a critical infrastructure sector, such as the electrical grid or
telecommunications sectors. The Financial Services ISAC is often
considered the greater among equals, as it has a highly automated system
for rapid cyber threat information exchange."99 As the foregoing
indicates, cyber will be a critical element of high-end conflict.
Enhancing deterrence and defense will require extensive actions by
allied and host nation militaries along with civil authorities and the
ISPs and grid operators in the host nation. VI. CONCLUSION High-end
conflict will create challenging requirements for cyber, far beyond
those that are already faced on an ongoing basis. [[The DoD needs to
**work with civil authorities and**]{.mark} **the ISPs and [grid
operators]{.mark}** [in the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates and
forward theaters to create the **prospects [for deterrence]{.mark}
and**, if necessary, to defend and prevail in conflict.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Solves Commercial

#### Integration of cybersecurity into private sector supply chains is uniquely key.

\\\\SYang

[The Biden administration has recently focused its [efforts on quelling
cybersecurity threats]{.mark} here on Earth. But security threats also
[exist in outer space as the U.S. increasingly relies on]{.mark}
government and [commercial satellites]{.mark} and other space assets
needed for telecommunications, 5G networks and defense systems
technology.]{.underline}

[The Wilson Center\'s Science and Technology Innovation Program will
provide an overview of potential cyberthreats in space during a July 14
virtual program titled \"Cybersecurity on the Final Frontier: Protecting
Our Critical Space Assets from Cyber Threats.\" The Washington,
D.C.-based center is holding the event in partnership with The Aerospace
Corp. and the Space Information Sharing and Analysis
Center.]{.underline}

Historically, the U.S. has been very dependent on space-based systems to
power everything from global positioning systems to 5G networks and to
provide the ability to take pictures of the Earth for weather
information, said Melissa Griffith, a public policy fellow with the
center\'s Science and Technology Innovation Program.

That reliance will only increase as rapidly evolving technology further
enables satellite capabilities.

\"There is an incredible range up there in terms of what we are using
them for,\" Griffith said. \"As our dependency increases on space-based
systems, so does our need to protect those systems, to build out secure,
defensible and resilient systems.\"

There have not been any publicly disclosed space security threats on the
same level of, say, the SolarWinds Corp. breach, Griffith said.

[But possible cyberspace threats could stem from nations such as Russia
and China, which have considerable space technology capabilities, as
well as criminal groups seeking to hack into systems that may result in
the loss of critical connectivity with defense weapons and or
communications systems. Those potential threats have increasingly become
a concern as the U.S. intelligence community investigates reports of
\"unidentified aerial phenomena\" that could indicate extraterrestrial
activity. Griffith could not speak to that specifically as it is not her
area of expertise.]{.underline}

[But the [cybersecurity issues are taking on extra significance]{.mark}
at a time [when]{.mark} a growing number of [private companies are doing
business in space with various business models]{.mark} and approaches to
the way they manage security risk. As of January, there were a total of
1,897 operating U.S. satellites, 1,486 of which are commercial,
according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. There are also a total
of 411 government, military and civil U.S. satellites.]{.underline}

[Among the [companies doing business in space]{.mark} are Blue Origin
LLC, which was founded in 2000 by former Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos,
and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., which operates the Starlink
satellite broadband service. Amazon Web Services Inc. helps commercial
and government customers build satellites and conduct space and launch
operations. Lockheed Martin Corp. is the prime government contractor
building NASA\'s Orion spacecraft.]{.underline}

[Thus far, companies have generally [focused less on security threats in
space and more on ensuring system functionality]{.mark} in one of the
harshest conditions known to mankind, Griffith said.]{.underline}

[But the Wilson Center is [encouraging policymakers]{.mark} and industry
players [to create framework]{.mark}s for cybersecurity best practices,
including [identifying vendors in the supply chain that are high risk
and pinpointing locations where ground-based stations]{.mark} --- the
brains of the satellites --- [can be more secure.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[\"One of the things that we are doing is saying, \'You\'re worried
about this, we\'re worried about this, here are some questions [you need
to start asking industry to understand risk]{.mark} in this space,\'\"
Griffith said.]{.underline}

#### 

#### [Solves]{.underline} better \-\-- [implementation of cyber norms]{.underline} at all [levels]{.underline} of the [supply chain]{.underline} is uniquely key \-\-- that requires [collaboration with the private sector]{.underline} that the plan can't access.

Amber **Gillette 21**, Staff Assistant Intern, Science and Technology
Innovation Program, September 16 2021, "From Supply Chains to
Spacecraft: Taking an Integrated Approach to Cybersecurity in Space",
https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/supply-chains-spacecraft-taking-integrated-approach-cybersecurity-space
\\\\SYang

In his opening remarks, Morin noted key ways in which the average
American interacts with space systems, including timing synchronization,
banking systems, and emergency service provisions. "[[Space is]{.mark}
really **[fully integrated into our society]{.mark}** and it's becoming
more so everyday,"]{.underline} said Morin. "Both U.S. national security
and our economic prosperity are dependent on space to a degree that most
people just don't fully appreciate."

[**Space systems** are [not one of]{.mark} the 16 **[critical
infrastructure sectors]{.mark}** that are recognized as vital to U.S.
national security and economy.]{.underline} However, developments in
space technology, from advancing rocket designs to commercial deorbit
services, are elevating space systems towards an official critical
infrastructure designation, according to Erin Miller, Executive Director
of the Space ISAC. "Even before Richard Branson travelled, space systems
were and are critical infrastructure... It's not necessarily the degree
to which we're dependent that makes the case, it's just the fact that we
are dependent upon space systems," she said.

At the same time that our dependence on space has grown, the increased
threat of cyberattacks has become a frightening reality for governments
and individuals alike. "If you've even modestly been following the news,
it's clear that adversaries---criminal adversaries, state adversaries, a
melange of both---are using cyberattacks that have an increasing
sophistication and they are reaching a wider impact then they have
before," said Morin. "There is no reason to believe that trend isn't
going to continue."

Space systems are not exempt from cyberattacks by any means, whether the
ground stations to satellites in orbit, or the data links in between.
This begs the question Morin posed to the speakers: "What needs to be
done, both from a policy standpoint but also at the technical
level---where the metaphorical rubber meets the road---to protect our
space systems from cyberattacks?"

Tackling the Unique Vulnerabilities of Space Technologies & Systems

Space systems---which are composed of the vehicles and infrastructure
needed to complete a task in the space environment, including but not
limited to ground stations, data links, and satellites---are vulnerable
to cyberattacks at multiple points, noted several speakers. "Satellites
present a unique challenge: \[they\] have a limited amount of storage,
memory and power on board and once you launch it, that's what you get,"
explained Prashant Doshi, Associate Principal Director of the Cyber
Security Subdivision. "You have to run the mission on the hardware
that's already there. So there's not a lot of extra hardware leftover to
run McAfee or some other anti-virus \[software\]."

[When thinking [about]{.mark} protecting [space infra]{.mark}structure,
[you have to look at the **entire**]{.mark} **space [system]{.mark}**,
according to Miller, [because all elements]{.mark} involved [are
**vulnerable to cyberattacks**]{.mark}. For example, low costs to entry
and a **wide pool of capable adversaries**---from "script kiddie"
hackers to sophisticated state actors---fosters an environment where an
attack against a ground station could come from anywhere.]{.underline}

Additionally, as more and more adversaries place spacecraft in orbit and
establish their capacity to conduct command link intrusions, the risk of
satellite disruption or even loss of operational control to an adversary
increases. The consequences of a cyberattack on space infrastructure can
be "anything from temporary disruption to complete mission failure,"
noted Brandon Bailey, The Aerospace Corporation's Cybersecurity Senior
Project Leader in the Cyber Assessments and Research Department.

[The [commercialization of the supply chain introduces]{.mark} new
[risk]{.mark} as well. Satellites used to be built according to a
"boutique" model, where one satellite was uniquely designed for its
purpose. However, with space becoming more accessible to a greater
number of operators, [it is]{.mark} now more [common to use
off-the-shelf components]{.mark}. This means that [all satellites are
vulnerable]{.mark} to cyber intrusion [if]{.mark} even [one part of
the]{.mark}ir shared [supply chain is corrupted]{.mark}. This threat of
supply chain intrusion, alongside the nature of cyberattacks in general,
means that [the consequences of supply chain attacks]{.mark} by
adversaries [could be wide-reaching]{.mark}. "It may not be practical to
fire hundreds of thousands of missiles at once, but it may be possible,
with a single \[cyber\]attack, to attack multiple spacecraft," said Ryan
Speelman, Principal Director of The Aerospace Corporation's Cyber
Security Subdivision.]{.underline}

Fortifying the Supply Chain through Information Sharing

One of the conclusions reached by the panel was that unique threats to
space systems are not being addressed to the same extent as unique
threats to other critical infrastructures[. In order to address these
vulnerabilities and prevent such attacks from taking place, several
panelists noted that [the U.S. must incorporate cybersecurity planning
into all stages of]{.mark} space system [development]{.mark}. The [first
step]{.mark} to reaching this goal is **[increas]{.mark}**ing
[collaboration and information sharing among **government organizations,
commercial companies**]{.mark}, and international partners [in the space
industry]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[According to Speelman, [the government uses a higher standard]{.mark}
of defense and security requirements for space systems [than private
companies]{.mark} do. This becomes a [problem when]{.mark} commercial
[companies do not fortify]{.mark} their space system components [against
cyberattacks]{.mark}.]{.underline} "It may be easy for DOD missions and
the military to say, 'well we don't care.' But when we're buying a bunch
of services, potentially bandwidth and other things from them, it
becomes a really big deal," he said.

[This alludes to a problem faced by space system developers: [due
to]{.mark} the [different **reg**]{.mark}ulation**[s]{.mark}** and
requirements used [by firms and]{.mark} within [the
**gov**]{.mark}ernment, [it is difficult to ensure]{.mark} that
[components from]{.mark} **all levels of [the supply chain]{.mark}**
[have the same quality of cyber protection]{.mark}. Miller explained
that [promoting **transparency across the industry will be
vital**]{.mark} to securing the entire supply chain for space
technologies. "I'm not asking that we specifically regulate those
companies, I'm asking that [in the Space ISAC]{.mark} that we come
together and we [collaborate]{.mark}," said Miller. "So that we're all
aware of the baseline expectation for cybersecurity and we have active
information sharing, so we have actionable intelligence around the
threats."]{.underline}

With the increasing prevalence of threats like ransomware attacks,
information sharing across sectors and stakeholders will only become
more critical. "We need to be very concerned and aware of whether or not
the space industry has visibility on these different types of attacks
and \[when\] they're getting the information in a timely manner, it's
going to the right people who can take action," Miller stated.

Overcoming Classification Barriers: Sharing What You Can

Transparency can be a difficult goal to reach in an industry where
classification and intellectual property protection are salient
concerns. However, there are ways to address potential vulnerabilities
without divulging sensitive information. "To help somebody, you don't
necessarily need to right away share everything you have. Just the fact
that you believe something is going on and it affects this particular
subsystem---you don't necessarily have to say what it is---that could be
really useful for a lot of people... A little bit of information early
on can help quite a bit." said Speelman.

The Space ISAC and other government agencies are working to provide as
much information as possible even with classification restrictions.
Designating space systems as a critical infrastructure would help the
flow of information. As Miller noted, "There's a concerted effort
towards making sure that the information that doesn't need to be
classified, that needs to be out there in the global space community, is
reaching the global space community\... We need to empower them, those
space system critical infrastructure owners and operators, and give them
the information they need."

[For successful prevention, [information sharing must take place **all
the way down the supply chain,**]{.mark} taking special effort to share
information [with **small and medium sized companies**]{.mark} involved
in space system development. It's not enough to target the large
companies and organizations in this effort, because "[if you're not
sharing]{.mark} that [with your supply chain]{.mark}, then [you're
introducing]{.mark} **additional unnecessary [risk]{.mark},"** said
Miler.]{.underline}

Building Resilience in Space Using a Defense-in-Depth Model

On a more technical level, the panelists discussed strategies to build
resiliency by fortifying space systems at multiple levels and leveraging
new modeling technologies to test space systems. According to Bailey,
the U.S. must incorporate a defense-in-depth model within its space
systems to ensure that multiple layers, from the software to the
encryption, are fortified against attack. "That's another way to look at
\[defense-in-depth\]: redundancy in your defenses," he explained, noting
that these defenses should provide not only preventative measures, but
detection and recoverability capacity as well.

Penetration testing is another critical component to finding and
mitigating vulnerabilities before they become problems, according to
Speelman. "If we are not constantly attacking and finding holes and
vulnerabilities in our own systems, our adversaries will do it for us,"
he said. "I don't think you can ever say your system is secure unless
you\'re willing to try and break it yourself." While project managers
are hesitant to put their systems at risk, additional system engineering
around the test itself and evolving digital twin technology allow
penetration tests to be conducted without significant risk to the space
asset itself.

Next Steps: Moving the Space Industry Towards Greater Cyber Awareness

Cybersecurity is not an issue that can be ignored or glossed over. If
the U.S. is not proactive in securing its space systems against
cyberattack, our adversaries will undoubtedly take advantage of our
vulnerabilities. "We make ourselves as a country so vulnerable to a
disruption in our space systems that it really will affect our society
and quality of life. On that day when we get into a conflict, we will
not be ready for \[it\]." said Doshi.

[In order to fortify space systems, **[policymakers]{.mark}, engineers,
[and private corporations]{.mark}** [must make a concerted
effort]{.mark} to change the way we develop and operate spacecraft.
Cybersecurity must be [built into **each layer of**]{.mark} **the
spacecraft's [design]{.mark}** and [at each stage of]{.mark} the
[supply]{.mark} chain, an endeavor that will require an entire industry
to adjust its operating procedures. "If we can get as many people as
possible pushing in that direction, I think we can make some big
progress," concluded Speelman.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Solves NC3

#### Solves NC3\-\--forensics techniques, backdoor reduction, shift in architecture, honeypots can be implemented solely by the US.

Dr. Jared **Dunnmon 17**, postdoctoral fellow in the Computer Science
Department at Stanford, xx/xx/2017, "Nuclear Command and Control in the
Twenty-First Century: Maintaining Surety in Outer Space and Cyberspace",
https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/resrep23162.5.pdf \\\\SYang

One approach to the above scenarios would be an in-depth analysis of
each question to determine exactly how the United States should respond.
[However, in light of substantial modernization to the NC3 system
currently planned and under way, [it is]{.mark} perhaps most [useful to
consider]{.mark} technological and policy [avenues]{.mark} that could be
pursued with the goal of [ensuring]{.mark} that the above
[scenarios]{.mark}, each of which is [fraught with uncertainty around
nuclear intentions]{.mark} and appropriate U.S. response, would [never
come to pass]{.mark}.]{.underline} Distinct sets of technology and
policy recommendations intended to inform discussion around
modernization and design of the future nuclear enterprise are presented
below. Technological Directions [[Several]{.mark} concrete technological
[initiatives]{.mark} would [help]{.mark} reduce operational uncertainty
and ensure resilient NC3 functionality. **[Apply Advanced Forensics
Techniques]{.mark}** All NC3 satellites should be outfitted with
advanced forensics capability.]{.underline} Motion sensors, heat
sensors, and EM intensity sensors should be emplaced in order to assess
whether any given satellite inoperability resulted from external
physical attack. [[For **protection from cyber attack**]{.mark},
domestic control over supply chains should be pursued to [reduce]{.mark}
the possibility of **[backdoors]{.mark}**, **[insecure]{.mark} or
undocumented [protocols]{.mark}**, and **[hard-coded
credentials]{.mark}**. Finally, in addition to traditional antivirus
scans of satellite software, commercially available [assessments]{.mark}
based on computationally efficient code-level machine learning tools
[that]{.mark} proactively [detect]{.mark} both new variants and
repackaged versions of existing [malware should be
implemented]{.mark}.48 Such methods should prove powerful in
**[reduc]{.mark}**ing [the possibility of a]{.mark} successful [cyber
attack on NC3]{.mark} systems.]{.underline} Emphasize Modern Network
Defense Techniques in NC3 [Traditionally, network defense has focused on
keeping attackers outside of a virtual "wall," while keeping all
critical functionality accessible to those with valid credentials. In
**[today]{.mark}**'s democratized cyber environment, [cost to attackers
is]{.mark} substantially [lower than]{.mark} cost to [defenders]{.mark}.
Thus [it is useful to]{.mark} consider **[mov]{.mark}**ing
**[to]{.mark}**ward [an architecture that is]{.mark} more akin to a
building [with all]{.mark} of its [doors open, but riddled with
traps]{.mark} and misdirection.]{.underline} As NC3 is modernized to
utilize Internet-based protocols,49 for instance, considering widespread
implementation of mechanisms designed to increase costs to attackers via
such methods as honeypots, script white-listing, and address scrambling
would help to deter and frustrate potential attackers.
[**[Honeypots]{.mark}**, or environments that look like useful targets
to an attacker but are in fact benign, [can]{.mark} be particularly
useful in enabling U.S. personnel to **[identify]{.mark} candidate
[attack vectors]{.mark} and enact defenses** before critical systems are
compromised.]{.underline} Script white-listing entails using efficient
data structures to enable a computer to run only code with a bit
representation that has been explicitly pre-specified as part of an
allowed execution set. [Finally, **address space scrambling methods**
such as **address space layout randomization** ([ASLR) protect
from]{.mark} common buffer [overflow attacks by **randomly
arranging**]{.mark} **address space positions of [key portions]{.mark}**
of a process, such that an attacker cannot jump between dif­ferent points
reliably.]{.underline} As a higher-level consideration, the United
States should consider the idea that it is generally not possible to be
completely sure that a networked computer system has not been
compromised. If an adversary informed the United States that it had
compromised U.S. NC3 and that surety of the nuclear deterrent had been
affected, it would be extraordinarily difficult for the United States to
prove otherwise, which fundamentally undermines the strength of the U.S.
deterrent posture. Thus, it is imperative that the United States be able
to viably make the argument that compromising the entirety of NC3 would
be a statistical impossibility; and for this to occur, there must exist
no possible mechanism for a single point of failure. While the command,
control, and communications triad architecture ensures this posture
adequately from a physical standpoint, it is imperative that NC3 systems
be constructed with the same ideas in mind. Specifically, the United
States should consider a fractionated NC3 network design, with a large
number of sub-networks, each secured via dif­ferent sets of protocols or
standards. In this case, it would be nearly impossible for an adversary
to convince either itself, the United States, or third parties that the
surety of the U.S. nuclear deterrent could be fully compromised by what
would effectively be a first cyber strike. [[**Minimize Code Base Size**
As systems are modernized]{.mark} to take advantage of twenty-first
century information technology (IT), the temptation will exist to
implement a great deal of additional functionality. While there may
exist substantial operational benefits to additional features, these
should always be balanced with the reality that **[more code]{.mark}
almost always [equates]{.mark} to [more vulnerability]{.mark}**---and
NC3 is an area wherein a vulnerability could result in mistakes of
nuclear import.]{.underline}50 Thus, the usual analysis around the
cost-benefit trade-off of IT upgrades may not apply to NC3 systems, and
this reality should be taken into account in system design processes.
Maintain Small-Scale Launch and Inexpensive NC3 Communications Hardware
A particularly interesting suggestion put forth by Dr. John Harvey,
former principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear,
chemical, and biological defense, is that "small, single-purpose
'cheap-SATs' to replenish lost communication or GPS \[global positioning
system\] functionality" could improve system-level resilience of
space-based NC3 assets. Instead of or in addition to large,
multifunctional satellites, leveraging the widespread proliferation of
small, inexpensive CubeSats51 that cost on the order of \$100,00052 to
construct and launch could substantially reduce overall system cost and
improve reliability. In addition to allowing inexpensive system updates
as technology improves, these small satellites would be extremely
difficult to target for ASAT operators. Further, since Dr. Harvey's
address in 2014, small-scale launch technology has seen significant
advances. In fact, several commercial entities currently have the
technology to offer 150-kilogram payloads to sun-synchronous orbit
(500-kilometer altitude) on a single dedicated rocket costing only \$5
million.53 These rockets could be retained specifically for emergency
NC3 launches as backups to current satellites. In this way, expensive
AEHF satellites that would require an expensive, large-scale launch to
reconstitute would be supplemented or ultimately replaced by a small
satellite and dedicated launch ecosystem that would result in a
substantially more resilient NC3 system. Moving to a reserve of small
satellites as a backup for the NC3 network would also have the advantage
of increasing the number of possible launch sites the United States can
use. At present, only a handful exist, and these are well-known to any
potential adversary.54 Decrease Reliance on Space-Based NC3 In addition
to shoring up the reliability of space-based NC3, ultimately decreasing
U.S. reliance on these assets would likely enhance overall NC3 surety.55
In particular, relying more on the various airborne components of the
NC3 system and deploying "long-range airborne communications relay
networks that could be stood up on short notice" would potentially
mitigate the vulnerabilities posed by cyber threats to space-based
assets. This risk reduction would result not only from the ability to
more rapidly deploy space-based systems, but also from the simple
reality that 50. Danzig, Surviving on a Diet of Poisoned Fruit. 51. A

Policy Considerations [[Carefully Consider **Unilateral
Action**]{.mark}: Anticipatory Self-Defense and Belligerent Reprisal
Given the Tallinn Manual's clear authorization of anticipatory
self-defense and the potentially dire consequences of the scenarios
outlined above, it [would be prudent to]{.mark} pursue a national policy
that enables U.S. intervention to [**combat the development of cyber
capabilities** that would compromise NC3]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the
context of peacetime international law, this would likely entail either
claiming extraterritorial jurisdiction over those developing anti-NC3
cyber capabilities and/or claiming anticipatory self-defense if an
attack is imminent. Were the United States to already be engaged in an
armed conflict, the functional equivalent of anticipatory self-defense
would be legally termed belligerent reprisal.57 In this case, if the
United States views attacks on NC3 as outside the boundaries established
by the LOAC, the question would become whether a proportional attack on
opponent (potentially on their NC3) would be appropriate, and, if so,
what form that proportional response would take[. Even in the case that
U.S. NC3 is compromised, for instance, [it is still desirable]{.mark}
from the U.S. point of view [for the adversary]{.mark}'s NC3 systems
[to]{.mark} be able to [verify that the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [has not launched a **nuclear
attack**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Thus, in the context of belligerent
reprisal, it is critical to make a clear policy decision on what
constitutes a proportional, but practically optimal response to an
attack on U.S. NC3.

[[The response to]{.mark} a complex and specifically internationalized
[cybersecurity]{.mark} problem [needs to be]{.mark} based on
**[a]{.mark}**n international **[coherent approach]{.mark}**, which can
be defined as a regime]{.underline} -- that is, a set of: ... implicit
or explicit principles, norms, rules and decision-making procedures
around which actors' expectations converge in a given area of
international relations. Principles are beliefs of fact, causation and
rectitude. Norms are standards of behaviour defined in terms of rights
and obligations. Rules are specific prescriptions or proscriptions for
action, decision-making procedures are prevailing practices for making
and implementing collective choice. [[There is an urgent requirement to
develop a]{.mark} space cybersecurity [regime that will inform and
organize policy efforts]{.mark} and subordinate strategies, [while
remaining federally networked]{.mark} rather than controlled from a
centre or hierarchically driven. [**Too centralized an approach** would
give]{.mark} the [illicit actors]{.mark}, who are generally unencumbered
by process or legislative frameworks, **[an unassailable
advantage]{.mark}** simply [because their **response**]{.mark} and
decision-making [**time** is]{.mark} more flexible and [faster
than]{.mark} that of their [legitimate opponents]{.mark}. To be
successful and durable, the space cybersecurity regime should be one
that functions intelligently and responsively, and possesses enough
flexibility to be able to react in a coordinated way as the environment
and circumstances alter.]{.underline} As noted above, over-zealous
central direction by regulators in a market-driven sector tends to lead
to the supply chain finding 'workarounds', leading to the risk of
developing a general culture of cyber insecurity in which the default
condition is simply to identify the best way to dodge the rules. This
hands another advantage to the adversaries of legitimate users of the
space domain. However, [[the international]{.mark} space [community has
not]{.mark} yet [acted as **a coherent system**]{.mark} in the area of
cybersecurity. This problem is compounded by the fact that the nature of
space and its relationship to society are entering a period of
fundamental change]{.underline}. The stakeholders required for the space
cybersecurity discourse remain essentially segregated (apart from
occasional meetings at events such as conferences), and are only
concerned with managing risks within their narrow fields of interest.
Left unaddressed, this dynamic will in all likelihood continue unless
there is an external stimulus. As a result, there will be little
recognition that each stakeholder can be affected by another's security,
or lack of it, unless there is a change in perceptions. A significant
element of self-help is required to make up for the shortcomings of the
regulatory cadre. A space cyber regime, based on a lightly regulated
initiative from the supply chain, seems to offer the most suitable and
sustainable basis for channelling multinational contributions to an
internationalized space cybersecurity capability which has to include an
ever greater number of different stakeholders. [[Such a regime must be
agile]{.mark} enough to meet the rapidly evolving security challenge
facing the space domain, and [to continue to develop]{.mark} as the
market is transformed over the next decades.]{.underline} Policy
requirements Ideally, the policy needed to establish a space
cybersecurity regime would align the needs of all the various concerns:
on an already complex international stage this would include the
millions of end users, individual scientists, the corporate sector and
the military; address technical, political, economic and social
interests; and combine the tactical with the strategic and the bottom-up
with the top-down approach. To align across and within all sectors, one
approach is to adopt a single focus -- such as the provision of assured
broadband via space -- and make that the driving force, organizing all
other initiatives around it. But the space domain is now becoming so
intrinsic to every human activity, whether government, private-sector or
individual, that the foundation of a more robust and coherent space
cybersecurity regime requires a common understanding of what is
essential to determine both the nature of the problem and threat
mitigation responses. The approach must be non-hierarchical, where each
stakeholder is empowered by knowledge provided by the regime and feels
valued as a contributor. Ensuring security in space must correspondingly
be a common ambition for all concerned players. Thus a common approach
to cybersecurity can be developed and encouraged by applying the
principles of governance, management and inclusiveness as outlined
below. Governance There are three paramount dimensions in the governance
of a space cybersecurity regime. First, whatever is done to combat space
cyber insecurity, policy should be adopted and applied in order to
enable legitimate users of space-related capability, while increasing
the costs (of entry, for example, or discovery and being subject to law
enforcement action) for illegitimate users. A culture of space
cybersecurity must lead to the development of an innate instinct for
what is safe and what is risky throughout the supply chain. [Second,
[the governance]{.mark} of space cybersecurity **[needs a collective
approach,]{.mark}** involving as many legitimate stakeholders as
possible and practical. This will also create a progressive and dynamic
environment where knowledge is a key ingredient; [if
participants]{.mark} can [share experiences]{.mark} and lessons learned,
[cybersecurity will become]{.mark} increasingly [instinctive]{.mark},
from the boardroom down to the shop floor, and its sum will increase.
Third, the regime needs to be based on a self-governing and lightly
regulated effort by a wide range of legitimate users of space
capability.]{.underline} This is because space infrastructure, with its
multiple uses, is a complex and constantly adapting area that defies
control, centralized management and oversight by any single stakeholder
(except for some very specific processes such as orbit or communications
frequency allocation). Experience suggests that there is no other option
but to deliver this effort within a business environment of transparency
and accountability involving collaboration designed to share knowledge.
Effective and durable governance of cyberspace requires a shared
awareness that implies a dynamic, common approach to raising cyber
capability. [A culture of space cybersecurity must lead to the
development of an innate instinct for what is safe and what is risky
throughout the supply chain.]{.underline}

[event could have]{.mark} **disproportionate [implications for the

security.]{.underline} For example, there may be places on the grid
where, because of system interdependencies, the loss of a particular
substation could trigger a cascade of impacts in multiple critical
infrastructure sectors. While many utilities have taken inventories to
identify critical facilities or customers, a broader national inventory,
combined with modeling and scenario analysis, should help to identify
priority areas for cybersecurity investment from the perspective of
protecting the grid as a whole. • [**[Event analysis.]{.mark}** While
NERC, FERC, state and provincial agencies, and potentially federal law

https://www.fifthdomain.com/international/2018/07/09/cyber-ambiguity-natos-digital-defense-in-doubt-amid-unstable-alliances/

Today, [[the alliance counts **cyber**]{.mark}**security**]{.underline}
[[as one]{.mark} of its]{.underline} [**[core missions]{.mark}**. It has
placed a]{.underline} **[new cyber research]{.underline}** [center in

[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} very [[future of NATO's]{.mark} cyber

During a May speech, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he is

Article 5 in the case for a cyberattack.

[**[Article 5]{.mark}** is the alliance's principle of **collective

unveiled in late June, [NATO added cyberwarfare to its joint operations
programs]{.underline}. The document boasts of the historic threat the
organization faces: "[For the first time since the end of the Cold War,
the Alliance has to be able to conduct operations."]{.underline}

[In 2014, [the alliance]{.mark} said for the first time that a
cyberattack could trigger the organization's collective-defense
mechanism. It [has proven a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[successful
deterrent]{.underline}** [to combat
**large**]{.underline}]{.mark}**[-scale]{.underline}** [digital
[attacks]{.mark} like the]{.underline} reported [Russian cyber assault
on **Estonia** in 2007]{.underline}, said Sorin Ducaru, a former
assistant secretary general of NATO. But he added that the alliance has
to be more creative in deterring medium- and low-grade cyberattacks
"because that is the world we are living in."

For Estonia, an aggressive NATO cyber policy could be the difference
between the smooth withdrawal of cash or a disturbing "error" sign
flashing on an ATM screen. An Estonian intelligence report from earlier
this year predicts Russia will continue its campaign of aggression in
Eastern Europe and the Baltic states through a combination of
cyberattacks and information warfare.

When it comes to digital threats, "each country has faced them alone.
NATO has not adopted a unified response," former Estonia President
Toomas Hendrik Ilves said during a May conference.

Today, nations are still loath to share information on cyberattacks,
Ilves said, recounting a story about how as president he reported a hack
on Estonia to NATO. "The response was: 'Oh, you, too.' I don't think
that's how we should be doing things."

Ilves is among those who have called for a cyber NATO ― an alliance of
nations cooperating in digital defense.

The top civilian of Estonia's Ministry of Defence also told Defense News
that international cooperation could help thwart cyberattacks.

"I think people are realizing that we need international cooperation,
and without international cooperation we simply cannot succeed in this
new domain," Jonatan Vseviov said.

Yet a bolstered NATO cyber response could mean a wave of new tension
with Russia and China, which are seen as two of the alliance's biggest
digital challengers.

[[It is]{.underline} **[unclear]{.underline}** [under
existing]{.underline}]{.mark} [NATO [**rules** how the alliance could be
**more aggressive**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in response to
cyberattacks]{.underline}, said Alex Crowther, a senior research fellow
at the National Defense University.

["In order [for Article 5 to be **voted on**, it has to]{.mark}
be]{.underline} [**something [major]{.mark}**. It [pretty much]{.mark}
has to be [an]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[armed attack]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline}]{.mark} [a]{.underline} [**[use of force]{.underline}**
[as discussed in the U.N. Charter. The]{.underline}]{.mark} [most
**[commonly adopted]{.mark} point of [view]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[is]{.mark} that [people have to be hurt or killed, or property]{.mark}
is damaged or [destroyed]{.mark}]{.underline}," Crowther told Fifth
Domain, a sister publication of Defense News. "I have met people who say
that [the [only]{.mark} attack that meets that criteria was the
[Stuxnet]{.mark} attack because it [caused damage]{.mark} to Iranian
centrifuges."]{.underline}

[[Even]{.mark} the hack on [Estonia did not]{.mark} meet the criteria
for [trigger]{.mark}ing the principal of [collective]{.mark}
self-[defense]{.mark}]{.underline}, Crowther added.

#### Cyber defense is [intentionally ambiguous]{.underline} -- the plan [removes flexibility]{.underline} and encourages [adversary probing]{.underline} -- current Article 5 threshold [properly responds]{.underline} to [armed attacks]{.underline}.

Z'hra **Ghavam 16**; Navy Lieutenant Commander; September 2016, \"NATO's

[[NATO's]{.mark} publicly **declared [policy]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on
**cyber**]{.mark} threats [is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**consciously** and
**[purposefully vague]{.mark}**]{.underline}.207 Why? [Strategic
**[ambiguity]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[has]{.mark} its
[benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to the Atlantic Council panel,
[[there is no "**redline**]{.mark}" or "**determined threshold**" that
would **automatically define**]{.underline} [a cyber act as an act of
war]{.underline}.208 [[Leaving]{.mark} the rules]{.underline}
**[undefined]{.underline}** [affords [NATO **ample
room**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in which [to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[operate]{.underline}**]{.mark}. For a 28-member multinational
organization that operates on the principle of consensus, [[**time** and
**latitude**]{.mark} for solidifying strategic-level decisions
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**critical**. If NATO
**publicized**]{.underline}]{.mark} [a cyber]{.underline} [[**redline**,
it would]{.underline} [**box the Alliance into a corner**.
This]{.underline}]{.mark} [kind of policy could]{.underline}
**[[embolden]{.mark} cyber [offenders]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and
provoke]{.mark} **[massive intrusions]{.mark}** that target NATO's
networks at]{.underline} **[[just below this
threshold]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Having a **defined
redline**]{.underline} [could [also invite]{.mark} **nefarious cyber
[actors]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to **cross**]{.underline} [it to
**test**]{.underline}]{.mark} [NATO's [resolve, **damage its
reputation**]{.mark}]{.underline} [as a leader in Euro-Atlantic
security, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[undermine]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} **[credibility]{.underline}** [of its]{.underline}
**[[Article 5]{.underline}]{.mark}** [commitments.]{.underline}

Following the Wales Summit in 2014, [NATO affirmed its stance on law and
cyberspace]{.underline} while refusing to address cyber redlines:

Our [policy]{.underline} also [recognizes that international
law]{.underline}, including international humanitarian law and the UN
Charter, [applies in cyberspace. Cyber attacks can reach a]{.underline}
**[threshold]{.underline}** [that **threatens**]{.underline} [national
and Euro-Atlantic **prosperity**, **security**, and
**stability**]{.underline}. Their impact could be as harmful to modern
societies as a conventional attack. We affirm, therefore, that [cyber
defense is part of NATO's]{.underline} **[core task]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} [**collective defense**. A decision as to when a cyber
attack would lead to the]{.underline} [**[invocation]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[Article 5]{.underline}** [would
be]{.underline}]{.mark} [taken by the **N**orth **A**tlantic **C**ouncil
on a **[case-by-case]{.mark} basis**]{.underline}.209

However, an [invocation of [Article 5 does]{.mark} not necessarily
[mean]{.mark} that a NATO response would **include [force]{.mark}**.
Article 5]{.underline} of the Washington Treaty [states]{.underline} the
following:

The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in
Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all
and consequently they agree that, [if such an]{.underline} [**armed
attack** occurs, each of them]{.underline}, in exercise of the right of
individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the
Charter of the United Nations, [will assist the Party or Parties so
attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other
Parties, such action **as it deems necessary**, including the use of
armed force, to]{.underline} **[restore]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[maintain]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[security]{.underline}**
[of the North Atlantic area]{.underline}.210

Thus, [as long as each Alliance member takes "such action as it deems
necessary," it cannot be found in violation of the collective defense
principle.]{.underline}211 [In the case of a]{.underline} **[major
act]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[cyberwar]{.underline}** [against
one of its members, [NATO could invoke Article 5 as
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[show of solidarity]{.underline}** [but opt
to]{.underline} **[refrain]{.underline}** [from]{.underline}]{.mark}
[employing **[kinetic]{.mark} military [force]{.mark}**]{.underline};
instead, [[the Alliance could use]{.mark} **purely [cybernetic
means]{.mark}**]{.underline} [or a **hybrid alternative**]{.underline}
that combined cybernetic tools with military force to fulfill its
objectives.

In all, [[NATO's]{.mark} **establishment**, **organization**, and
**employment** of its sophisticated cyber [response
agencies]{.mark}]{.underline} and IT resources like the NCIRC, NCIO,
NCIA, and RRT [[are indicative of how]{.underline}
**[serious]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[ly]{.underline}** [[the Alliance has
implemented]{.mark} its **cyber [defense]{.mark} policies**]{.underline}
[[at the]{.underline} **[operational level]{.underline}**]{.mark}[.
NATO's [**cyber policy**, **s**]{.mark}tandard **[o]{.mark}**perating
**[p]{.mark}**rocedure[**s**, and]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[ambiguous
thresholds]{.underline}**]{.mark} [for the use of military force [make
the Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[highly prepared]{.mark} to respond
effectively]{.underline}** [to major acts of cyber
aggression]{.underline} against one or more of its members. [If an act
of cyberwar **met the threshold**]{.underline} [of an]{.underline}
[**armed attack**, NATO would]{.underline} probably [be prepared [to
**manage**, **counter**, and **resolve** the issue]{.mark}]{.underline}
in cyberspace; still, one cannot exclude the possible need to take
kinetic measures. Out of a numerical ranking of 1--3, the Alliance
earned a preparedness score of 3 in cyber strategy.

### 2NC -- Turns Case

#### This solves their offense -- a general consensus is good but [shouldn't be official policy]{.underline} -- ambiguity [stops miscalculation]{.underline} and [preserves flexibility]{.underline} for [unanticipated threats]{.underline}. 

Ken **Jones 15**; MS in Cyber Systems and Operations from the Naval
Postgraduate School; March 2015, \"Cyber War: The Next Frontier for
NATO,\"
https://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/45201/15Mar_Jones_Ken.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y

Finally, [[NATO needs]{.mark} to **maintain [ambiguity]{.mark}** [on
what **justifies**]{.mark} an **[Article 5]{.mark}**
response]{.underline}. As mentioned previously, ambiguity has served
NATO well. [A **set threshold** for when NATO will invoke an Article 5
response to a cyber-attack on a member country is **not necessary**.
This [ambiguity has **historically** served]{.mark} the alliance
[well]{.mark}, as [demonstrated by]{.mark} the **[9/11]{.mark}**
attacks. If the alliance had said weapons]{.underline} were [only
include guns, bullets, tanks, and bombs, it would have set a threshold
precluding a NATO response to attacks that turned four planes into
improvised missiles. The **larger issue** of ambiguity is that there is
**no set definition** of what constitutes an armed attack]{.underline}
and what circumstances dictate a collective response, as per Article 5.
[[Remaining ambiguous on]{.mark} the **[severity threshold]{.mark}** of
a cyber-attack [allows the alliance to act in cases of]{.mark} future
cyber-attacks that cause [**severe damage**, but also]{.mark} allow NATO
to **[refrain from over-reacting]{.mark}**, even if an event is a
**cyber**, or **kinetic**, attack as per a definition. [It would be a
**mistake** to **set a threshold** for attacks that **cannot currently
be anticipated**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[When NATO was]{.underline} originally [formed, it was with the purpose
to be unambiguous]{.underline}, with the promise of "massive
retaliation" by Eisenhower. This was meant [to constantly act as a
reminder to the Soviet Union]{.underline} and the Red Army that if they
were to surge into Western Europe, in no uncertain terms NATO would
respond with nuclear weapons. [Ambiguity is useful in times, and at
other times, it is not]{.underline}. Had NATO been ambiguous in dealing
with the Soviet Union, there could have been opportunity for the Red
Army to advance further across Europe, to test and see what NATO, and
the United States, would allow them to get away with, without an attack.
[Ambiguity can]{.underline} also [cause problems]{.underline},
particularly in the event of a cyber-attack with some members feeling an
attack might warrant retaliation through Article 5, with others feeling
that the necessary thresholds have not been met. [[It is important for
NATO to have a]{.mark} **clear understanding**, or [**general belief**,
of what would constitute a **serious**]{.mark} enough
[cyber-attack]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to respond, [[but **not
through official policy or rules** to ensure **proper
consideration**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- ! -- Non-State

#### Ambiguity specifically solves [non-state actors]{.underline} -- spills over to [responding to state actors]{.underline} which solves case. 

Łukasz **Kulesa 19**; Deputy Head of Research at the Polish Institute of
International Affairs, MA in International Relations from the Faculty of
Law of Jagiellonian university; 11/28/19, \"The Future of Deterrence:
Effectiveness and Limitations of Conventional and Nuclear Postures,\"
https://carnegieeurope.eu/2019/11/28/future-of-deterrence-effectiveness-and-limitations-of-conventional-and-nuclear-postures-pub-80440

[[NATO needs to be]{.underline} **[careful]{.underline}**
[about]{.underline} **[defining]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline}
**[signaling]{.underline}** [its [**redlines**. Making these]{.mark}
boundaries **too [specific]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[could]{.underline}
**[embolden adversaries]{.underline}** [to intensify their
actions]{.underline}]{.mark} [below NATO's declared
threshold]{.underline} of response. [[Being **deliberately
ambiguous**]{.mark} and [raising]{.mark} the **[fear of
retribution]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[may be]{.underline} **[more
useful]{.underline}** [for encouraging]{.underline}]{.mark}
[adversaries' self-[restraint]{.mark}]{.underline}.

At the same time, [[NATO should]{.mark} aim to [deter]{.mark} specific
types of particularly threatening unconventional activities. These
include **major**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[sophisticated]{.underline}** [[cyber attacks]{.mark} against allies'
military forces and critical military and civilian infrastructure, proxy
military and special forces operations, and state-sponsored terrorism.
[NATO could **declare**]{.mark} that [such activities]{.mark} may lead
it to [invoke **Article 5** and respond]{.mark} in **various ways**,
including]{.underline} **[asymmetrically]{.underline}** (for example,
the response to a cyber attack may not involve only cyber capabilities).

The alliance must be able to identify early whether and when
unconventional and hybrid gray-zone actions have become a more
substantial and coordinated campaign. In such a case, [NATO should aim
to deter the adversary from escalating further.]{.underline} This
requires increasing the alliance's capacity to share early-warning
intelligence and pool national intelligence-gathering, investigation,
and attribution capabilities. [NATO should not shy away from
**attributing**]{.underline} [ongoing operations to **state
adversaries**, relying on **national data**]{.underline} as needed. The
alliance and its members should be prepared to use direct channels of
communication and other means to deliver immediate deterrence signaling
in specific cases.

On the Southern flank, [[NATO faces]{.mark} state actors that use
unconventional tactics and proxy forces (for example, **Iran** and
**Syria**); **[state collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and the emergence
of [ungoverned spaces]{.mark}]{.underline} in Libya, Yemen, and parts of
the Sahel; [and the activities of a range of]{.underline} [**[nonstate
actors]{.mark}**, from **[loose groups]{.mark}** to]{.underline}
**[[terrorist]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and **[criminal
networks]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} highly organized
[quasi-state structures]{.mark} like]{.underline}
**[Hezbollah]{.underline}**. Cooperation with regional partners in
addressing these threats will be vital. NATO's primary task, as
elsewhere, should be to deter states in the region from using
unconventional tactics against NATO and its allies, using signaling and
attribution tools. When possible, the alliance should aim to affect the
calculus of nonstate actors to prevent them from harming alliance
interests. This may not work with jihadist groups but may be possible
with actors motivated by political or economic interests.

[[Since]{.mark} many of the [**unconventional threats** are not]{.mark}
linked to [specific regions or actors, a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[more
general approach]{.underline}** [is called for]{.underline}]{.mark}[.
The alliance and its members need to **continue investing**]{.underline}
[in passive and active measures to neutralize unconventional threats,
including in peacetime. Further [developing]{.mark} **cyber
[defense]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[offensive
capabilities]{.underline}**]{.mark}---[NATO's toolbox for countering
hybrid tactics]{.underline}---[and strengthening resilience [can affect
adversaries' **willingness**]{.mark} to use unconventional
means]{.underline} against NATO [[and]{.mark} thus help
[establish]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**deterrence by denial**. The
toolbox]{.underline}]{.mark}---counterterrorism, special forces,
information operations, disruption of terrorist groups' cyberspace
activities---[that allies develop [for]{.mark} dealing with]{.underline}
**[[non]{.mark}state]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline}
**[quasi-state]{.underline}** [entities]{.underline}]{.mark} [posing
unconventional threats [can also]{.mark} be used to]{.underline}
**[[deter state adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that rely on such
tactics]{.underline}.

### 2NC -- Link -- Deterrence

#### Ambiguity deters attacks -- clarification [encourages attackers]{.underline} and causes [alliance disputes]{.underline}.

60\. [[NATO]{.mark} maintains a **[cyber]{.mark}
deterrence**]{.underline} [policy of]{.underline}
**[[ambiguity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. First, [it [does not draw
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[clear line]{.underline}** [for
when]{.underline}]{.mark} [a [cyber]{.mark} attack [is
**sufficiently**]{.mark} **harmful** [to cross]{.mark}]{.underline} the
threshold [[to]{.mark} an]{.underline} **[[armed
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Second, [it does not currently have an
**operational definition**]{.underline} [of what the **collective
response**]{.underline} [would be]{.underline} if that threshold were to
be crossed. [Such a cyber deterrence policy offers]{.underline}
**[several advantages]{.underline}**, but also poses distinct
challenges.

61\. A certain degree of [[ambiguity is beneficial]{.mark} because [it
could **make opponents wary**]{.mark}]{.underline} [of going too far in
their cyber attacks. [The opponent]{.mark} **always [fears]{.mark}**
stepping over [the **invisible line**, and]{.mark} thus
[prefers]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[treading
lightly]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [A similarly vague deterrence
posture]{.underline} arguably [worked well during the Cold]{.underline}
War. However, ambiguity on where the threshold lies could indeed lead an
opponent who is sufficiently comfortably with taking risks, to
continuously exploit the 'grey zones', test the defender's resolve, and
conduct ever more daring cyber attacks.

62\. [[If the Alliance were to set]{.mark} a]{.underline} [[**clear
threshold**, the opponent would]{.mark} **better [understand]{.mark}**
[how to **stay below that**]{.mark} **threshold**]{.underline}. [This
would strengthen deterrence of threats above the threshold
but]{.underline} would [**encourage** the **opponent** to **increase
attacks** just **below the threshold**]{.underline}. Arguably, the
solution for such attacks cannot be found in deterrence, but rather in
clearly defined policy response for hybrid operations. Despite its best
efforts, the Alliance continues to struggle to develop such options.
[[Setting]{.mark} **specific [thresholds]{.mark}** without strong
options for hybrid operations [would]{.mark} only [encourage
more]{.mark} of them]{.underline}. Moreover, the [[Allies could]{.mark}
also **[find it hard to agree]{.mark}**]{.underline} [on and perhaps
also credibly commit to a specific threshold.]{.underline} Thus, [[on
balance]{.mark}, the policy of]{.underline} **[[ambiguity]{.mark} on
thresholds [makes sense]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

63\. [[NATO's ambiguity]{.mark} also [extends to]{.mark} the type of
[punishment]{.mark} it threatens were it to suffer a cyber attack. [The
Alliance]{.mark} has made **clear**]{.underline} [that it
neither]{.underline} **[limits punishment]{.underline}** [to similar
cyber attacks **nor excludes**]{.underline} [them]{.underline}. Instead,
[it [keeps the **option**]{.mark} **open**]{.underline} [[to use
the]{.underline} **[full range]{.underline}** [of Allied capabilities
to]{.underline} **[deter]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[counter]{.underline}**]{.mark} [cyber [attacks]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Once again, [[this **introduces useful doubt**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in
an opponent's mind. While NATO would **retaliate**]{.underline} [in
a]{.underline} [**proportional manner**, it could do so through similar
**cyber attacks**]{.underline}, [**air strikes**, or worse. A more
**technical reason**]{.underline} [for the difficulty of restricting
retaliation to cyber attacks is that it is]{.underline} **[hard to
credibly threaten]{.underline}** [the assets of the attacker in a
similar fashion]{.underline}. If an attacker shuts down a power plant,
would the Alliance have cyber options to attack an opponent's power
plants or similar infrastructure? Would NATO even want to if it could?

64\. [On balance, NATO's **[ambiguity]{.mark}** on the **type of
retaliation**]{.underline} [serves a]{.underline} [**convincing
purpose**. It **produces doubts**]{.underline} [in the would-be
attacker's mind and **[presents]{.mark} more
[options]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to **tailor**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[scale]{.underline}**]{.mark} [a [response to
**re-establish deterrence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. That being said, in
practice, this so-called cross-domain deterrence can be complicated,
problematic, and difficult to control (Nye, 2017). For example,
proportional response in the mind of the defender might look escalatory
to the attacker.

#### The plan [gives adversaries impunity]{.underline} to confidently act [below the threshold]{.underline} -- case-by-case evaluation is [intentional]{.underline} and [advantageous]{.underline}.

Mustafa **Canbolat and** Emrah **Sezgin 16**; PhD in Management Science

and Business Analytics at the State University of New York; MBA as an
International Military Officer from the Naval Postgraduate School,
Senior Program Manager at Amazon; December 2016; \"Is NATO Ready for a
Cyberwar?\" https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=810939

One of the most discussed issues in the international arena after the
9/11 attacks was the Digital Disaster scenario that could be experienced
in a member country (Bicakci, 2014). [Many countries have **incorporated
cyber security** strategies in their **national security** strategies in
order to **address** cyber-attacks]{.underline} that could threaten the
state. The role of NATO in the case of a serious cyberattack against a
member country has been a conundrum.

Due to the difficulty of attributing a cyber-attack, [[NATO]{.mark}
appears to have a **pragmatic** cyber **security posture** that
[handles]{.mark} each **[attack]{.mark}** on a **[case-by-case]{.mark}**
basis]{.underline} (Burton, 2015). However, [NATO [officially]{.mark}
stated that "[NATO will consider]{.mark}]{.underline} (and potentially
implement) [a collective [**Article 5** response to
cyber]{.mark}-attacks against NATO members, just as it did in response
to]{.underline} the terrorist attacks on **[9/11]{.underline}**"
(Burton, 2015, p. 308). Nevertheless, [the **[threshold]{.mark}** for
the cyber-attacks that could **invoke** Article 5 [is **not
certain**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The head of
[[NATO's]{.underline}]{.mark} Emerging Security Challenges division,
Jamie Shea stated that "\[w\]e are [[keeping that **ambiguous** so
a]{.mark} potential [**aggressor** does not get the **idea** they
can]{.mark} carry out cyber-[attack]{.mark}s [**up to a certain level**
with impunity]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Ashford, 2014, para. 8). [Even
[though setting a]{.mark} **specific** and [**certain threshold** would
make it easier]{.mark} for NATO [to determine when to invoke]{.mark}
Article 5]{.underline} against a cyber-attack, [[keeping]{.mark} it
[ambiguous gives]{.mark}]{.underline} an [**[advantageous
flexibility]{.mark}** to the alliance [regardless of the **attack** or
**adversary**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Jones, 2015).

[[Article 5 was **purposely**]{.mark} **left [vague]{.mark}** to give
NATO **more flexibility** to **assess** a threat and **determine a
response**. Therefore, it is also uncertain what kind of a response NATO
would give]{.underline} against a cyber-attack. Would it be a cyber or a
kinetic operation against the adversary if Article 5 were triggered?
[The answer to this question is **deliberately** left **ambiguous**,
[reinforcing NATO's position]{.mark} that [it will **evaluate**
cyber-attacks on **case-by-case** basis]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Closing the [window of escalation]{.underline} encourages adversaries -- their [choice]{.underline} of grey-zone threats [signals sensitivity]{.underline} to escalation. 

Sugio **Takahashi 19**; Chief of Policy Simulation at the National
Institute of Defense Studies, MA in Political Science from Waseda
University; 1/9/19; \"Development of gray-zone deterrence: concept
building and lessons from Japan's experience,\" The Pacific Review, Vol.
31, Issue 6, p. 787-810

Third aspect of gray zone deterrence is that [[deterring states should
**never close the window**]{.underline} [for
**escalation**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}]{.mark} [**main
[reason]{.mark}** why the [**challengers** use **gray zone
threats**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to change the status quo [is]{.mark}
that,]{.underline} first, [they are]{.underline}
**[discontent]{.underline}** [with the status quo and, second, [they
**recognize**]{.mark} **their [inferiority]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in
**conventional**]{.mark} **military [challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Mazzar, 2015). [The challenger may choose gray zone creeping expansion,
rather than conventional military challenge, because
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[cost]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [conventional [military challenge
would]{.mark}]{.underline} **[easily [exceed]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[potential **[gain]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Therefore, [[they]{.mark}
may]{.underline} **[[refrain]{.mark} from launching]{.underline}** [the
challenge in the first place [if they realize]{.mark} that their
[expansion has **plausible risk**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of
**escalating**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to **military
conflict**]{.underline}. [[The **tripwire**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[definitely [has an effect]{.mark} that [the challenger estimates
**higher possibility for escalation**. If deterring states]{.mark}
absolutely **[refrain]{.mark} from escalating**]{.underline}
[countermeasures, [the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[challenger]{.mark}
side]{.underline}** [[can **continue** gray zone **creeping**]{.mark}
**expansion [eternally]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[without]{.mark} taking
**[any risk]{.mark}**]{.underline} [accompanied with escalation. In
order [to stop them]{.mark}, the deterring side needs to **develop
robust posture to win**]{.underline} [the **possible war**]{.underline}
[in the case of escalation, and **[make]{.mark} the [challengers

To answer this question, [it is important to look at the first (and
only) time NATO invoked an Article 5 response;]{.underline} namely,
[following the **9/11** attacks on the **U**nited **S**tates. When the
partners of the alliance first wrote the Washington Treaty, it was
initially to deter the Russians]{.underline} from expanding and to deter
nuclear warfare at the onset of the Cold War. [[Article 5 is
**purposefully vague** to give]{.mark} NATO considerable [**room to
maneuver**. Before]{.mark} the [9/11]{.mark} attacks led by Al Qaida,
[it would have been]{.mark}]{.underline} [**nearly [impossible]{.mark}**
[for anyone]{.mark}, anywhere, including the framers of the Washington
Treaty, [to **imagine** such an **attack**.]{.mark} Likewise, at the
2014 summit]{.underline} in Wales, [[NATO]{.mark} announced that it
would and [could invoke]{.mark} an [Article 5]{.mark} response to a
cyber-attack, [and]{.mark} that the [ambiguity would
stand]{.mark}]{.underline}.158 NATO's Ambassador Sorin Ducaru, NATO's
assistant secretary general [[for "**emerging**]{.mark} **security
[challenges]{.mark}**]{.underline}," made the following remarks:

[\[T\]here's [no **predetermined
threshold**]{.mark}]{.underline}...[there [was a **conscious
decision**]{.mark} by the allies in this policy that there is benefit in
keeping **flexibility** and **ambiguity**]{.underline}...[article 5 was
**by design** something that should be **invoked politically** by
\[member\] nations in a specific context, on a case by case
basis]{.underline}...[article 5 was never designed to be triggered by a
certain threshold.]{.underline} The only time it was invoked was after
9/11, which was a scenario that had never been contemplated by the
founding partners.159 In this same vein, Christopher Painter, the U.S.'
State Department cyber coordinator said:

[The NATO leaders' declaration that **international law** including the
**UN Charter**, the **L**aw **o**f **A**rmed **C**onflict,
**i**nternational **h**umanitarian **l**aw,]{.underline} etc. [applies
in cyberspace just like]{.underline} it does in [the physical
world]{.underline}...[\[t\]his is a **clear statement** that this is not
a lawless space]{.underline}. There was some doubt before. There was
some thought you had different rules entirely for the cyber world than
the physical world, which made no sense and in fact would be very
destabilizing.160

In light of the recent developments of NATO, [[it
would]{.underline}]{.mark} seem to [[be in NATO's **best interest** to
remain **ambiguous** and allow]{.mark} the organization to approach its
[response]{.mark} to a cyber-attack [on]{.mark} a [case-by-case
basis]{.mark}. For instance]{.underline}, the
[[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} on Estonia [[might **require
intervention** on behalf of]{.underline}]{.mark} the Estonian people due
to the fact they are [[a smaller]{.mark}, lesser defensible
[state]{.mark}]{.underline}. Estonia would not be successful standing up
against Russia, and as Russia becomes more aggressive in the
former-Soviet bloc region, small states like Estonia are at risk. If
another attack were to occur against Estonia, the attacks would have to
be more severe to invoke an Article 5 response. Such a response would
enable NATO states to act as if they too have been attacked as per the
mutual defense announcement against cyber-attacks at the Wales Summit.
[[Yet]{.mark}, if [the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates is
attacked in a similar manner, there [likely does not need]{.mark} to be
[the same scale]{.mark} of defense taken, [because the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [has]{.mark} **more resources**
and [**capabilities** to respond on its own. Remaining ambiguous allows
NATO to **choose the best**]{.mark} **opportunities** for
**[support]{.mark}ing** and **defending** member states]{.underline}.

#### Article 5 is [appropriately flexible]{.underline} -- builds in discretion and [empirically works]{.underline} for traditional and cyber threats.

Strategic Ambiguity on Cyber Deterrence,\"
https://breakingdefense.com/2014/11/natos-hews-to-strategic-ambiguity-on-cyber-deterrence/\]

[[NATO is]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[taking **cyber**]{.mark}
**threats** [as]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[seriously]{.underline}**
[as]{.underline}]{.mark} the [Russian tanks and **[nuclear]{.mark}
weapons**]{.underline} it was created to deter. But the alliance has a
long way to go just to shore up its own network defenses, and it
explicitly eschews any role on the offense. NATO has not even written a
formal policy on how it would deter a cyber attack.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} net [[result is]{.mark} a certain degree
of]{.underline} **[[strategic ambiguity]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- but
then [[NATO has]{.mark} survived and even]{.underline} [[**thrived on
ambiguity** for decades]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The crucial development: September's NATO summit declaration that [the
alliance's hallowed Article 5]{.underline} --- which says an attack on
one member is an attack against all --- [applies equally to virtual
attacks]{.underline} as to physical ones.

"\[In\] linking cyber defense to collective defense and Article 5, the
declaration says that cyber attacks...could be as harmful to modern
society as conventional attack," said Amb. Sorin Ducaru, NATO's
assistant secretary general for "emerging security challenges."

That said, the Romanian diplomat emphasized at an Atlantic Council panel
this week, [["there's no]{.mark} predetermined threshold," no defined
"[red line]{.mark}" beyond [which]{.mark} a [cyber attack counts
as]{.mark} an act of war]{.underline}. But then [NATO **never
defined**]{.underline} [an automatic trigger for
**conventional**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[nuclear]{.underline}**
[conflict either, even during the height of the Cold War. [Article
5]{.mark} **only [commits]{.mark}**]{.underline} [a [NATO]{.mark} member
[to **"assist"** allies]{.mark} under attack [by]{.mark} "such
**[actions]{.mark} as [it deems necessary]{.mark}**]{.underline},
including the use of armed force" --- [[which leaves]{.mark} vast
amounts of **[wiggle room]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

There was always doubt whether the United States would really risk
nuclear escalation against its homeland to defend West Germany, and, for
that matter, whether West Germany would stick with the alliance once
wartime commanders started using tactical nuclear weapons on its soil to
slow the Soviet horde. Yet despite these uncertainties, the Soviets were
ultimately still deterred.

So [when it came to cyber]{.underline}, Ducaru said, "[[there
was]{.mark} a]{.underline} **[[conscious decision]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[by [the]{.mark} allies in this policy that there is]{.underline}
**[[benefit]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in keeping
**[flexibility]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[ambiguity]{.underline}**]{.mark}."

"[[Article 5 was by design]{.mark} something that should be invoked
politically]{.underline} by \[member\] nations [in a]{.underline}
[**specific context**, on a]{.underline} **[[case by
case]{.underline}]{.mark}** [basis]{.underline}," Ducaru said. "[Article
5 was never designed to be triggered by a certain
threshold.]{.underline} \[In fact,\] the only time it was invoked was
after 9/11, which was a scenario that had never been contemplated by the
founding partners.

Despite that one area of (arguably inevitable) strategic ambiguity, the
NATO summit made the situation in cyberspace much clearer, argued
Christopher Painter, the State Department's cyber coordinator. Beyond
Article 5, "the NATO leaders' declaration \[stated\] that international
law including the UN Charter, the Law of Armed Conflict, international
humanitarian law, etc. applies in cyberspace just like it does in the
physical world," Painter said at the Atlantic Council event. "This is a
clear statement that this is not a lawless space --- \[and\] there was
some doubt before. There was some thought you had different rules
entirely for the cyber world than the physical world, which made no
sense and in fact would be very destabilizing."

"[[Cyber seems]{.mark} so weird and [different]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[that\] [it's really inhibited seeing which of [the old laws]{.mark}
and ways of thinking about it]{.underline} might
[[apply]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Jason Healey, the Atlantic Council's
in-house cyber strategist. In fact, he argued, "[[the more]{.mark}
**strategically [significant]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[the conflict,
the]{.underline} **[more similar]{.underline}** [it is
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [conflict in the [**air**, **land**, and

The idea that [[**public data** can]{.mark} point to future
cyberattacks]{.underline} has been embraced by several government
agencies.

[The intelligence community's **research** arm]{.underline}, the
Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, [is researching how
data can help **[forecast]{.mark} a [cyberattack]{.mark}** by using
sensors that predict when a target is vulnerable]{.underline} to
hackers. BAE Systems, Charles River Analytics, Leidos, and the
University of Southern California are the prime contractors on the
project.

[There is a "**significant link** between hackers use of social
media]{.underline} platforms, [especially Twitter and
Facebook,]{.underline} and the volume of web defacement attack,"
according to 2017 research backed by the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence and IARPA.

But experts have had mixed results with predicting cyberattacks with
machine learning and open data.

By [[analyzing conversations]{.mark} of known criminals on the dark web,
researchers]{.underline} from the University of California also tried to
[[create]{.mark} an **[early warning system]{.mark}** for incoming
cyberattacks]{.underline} in 2017. [That approach was [84 percent
effective]{.mark} at **predicting current** or **imminent
cyberattacks**]{.underline}.

Also in 2017, three researchers used historical attack count data to
predict future cyberattacks to some success. It was 14 percent more
effective than other models.

However, others believe [[the **future** of **predicting**]{.mark}
cyberattacks [through **artificial intelligence** will combine]{.mark}
both [**humans** and **computers**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology created a
computer system in 2016 that continuously incorporated information from
human experts with a success rate of 85 percent while also [[decreasing

["[The more]{.mark} attacks [the system detects, the more]{.mark}

#### Cyber security reform is seen as authoritarian surveillance legislation. 

Peter **Hess 16**, writer for Scienceline, \"Controversial new
cybersecurity law may compromise privacy\"; Scienceline; Published:
1-24-2016; Accessed: 2-5-2022;
https://scienceline.org/2016/01/controversial-new-cybersecurity-law-may-compromise-privacy/

The recent, highly publicized cyberattacks on Sony and the U.S.
government's Office of Personnel Management exposed sensitive data about
millions of people. In Congress, lawmakers responded by approving the
[[Cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark} Information Sharing Act, or CISA.
But some critics say the bill, which President Obama signed into law on
Dec. 18, not only would have done nothing to prevent those attacks, but
also erodes personal privacy.

CISA encourages companies to share digital signatures --- unique codes
that track the origins of electronic communications, including the
sender's IP address --- associated with possible security threats, both
with each other and with the U.S. government. Supporters say this
information sharing makes it easier for companies and the government to
quickly get out ahead of security threats by alerting each other to the
origin and nature of potential breaches. [[Opposition]{.mark} to the new
law has [come from tech]{.mark}nology [companies]{.mark}, along with
[advocacy groups]{.mark}, such as the American Civil Liberties Union,
that are [worried about **protecting privacy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Critics say CISA's focus on digital signatures is invasive and fails to
include more current and relevant threats. Some even question whether
the slow-moving machinery of lawmaking can ever keep up with the
breakneck pace of the online world, where entirely new kinds of security
threats regularly arise in an instant, seemingly out of nowhere.

"It was the intention of our founding fathers that policy should be slow
because it prevents tyranny," says Elissa Shevinsky, head of product at
Brave, a company that focuses on easy-to-use privacy software. "If
policy were fast, we'd be in a surveillance state. We'd have CISA
already. It's on us to fight hackers at the pace of hacking." [[Private
cybersecurity companies]{.underline}]{.mark} like hers, she adds, [[are
**better positioned**]{.underline}]{.mark} to handle these security
issues.

Privacy concerns are a key issue for [[critics]{.underline}]{.mark} like
Shevinsky, who [say]{.underline} CISA [[erodes **privacy rights** by
going too far in encouraging companies **to share private
information**]{.underline}]{.mark} [with the U.S.
government]{.underline}. An important element of the bill would protect
companies from liability if they shared such data. According to
Shevinsky, that would encourage companies to flout their own privacy
policies by sharing their customers' personal information. Before the
bill passed, federal agencies could penalize companies for betraying
their privacy policies, she says. CISA in its current form would not
require companies to scrub customers' identifying information from the
data before sending it to other companies or the government. "CISA makes
it so they can \[share private information\] in broad daylight,"
Shevinsky says.

But he's also a [[major **reason** **little** **legislation**]{.mark} on
these topics [**ever** **passes**]{.mark}, [according to]{.mark}
lobbyists, [cybersecurity]{.mark} policy [experts]{.mark}, lawmakers and
congressional aides from both parties who spoke with

[**[Johnson]{.mark}** or members of his staff have [**derailed**

study whether the growing use of encrypted apps hampers law enforcement,
and hold companies accountable for the proliferation of insecure
connected devices, people who track the legislation told
POLITICO.]{.underline}

[[His panel]{.mark} "is the place [where legislation **goes** **to**
**die** on cybersecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Mieke Eoyang, a
former Hill aide and vice president for the national security program at
Third Way, a centrist think tank in Washington that works on national
technology policy issues.

While [no official accounting exists [of cybersecurity bills]{.mark} in
Congress, Third Way counted [15]{.mark} in the last Congress that passed
the House and [didn't advance through]{.mark} the Senate Homeland
Security and Governmental Affairs [Committee]{.mark}, which
[Johnson]{.mark} has [led since 2015.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"The record speaks for itself," [former House Homeland Security Chairman
Michael McCaul (R-Texas) told POLITICO, expressing frustration over the
fact that [Johnson **hasn't** **advanced** **cybersecurity**
**bills**]{.mark} that [his panel approved]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Many of the 15 people POLITICO spoke with for this story refused to be
named for fear of angering a chairman who [**holds** **sway** over
legislation]{.mark} now pending in Congress. But all agreed that Johnson
[either]{.mark} actively [**stymied** **cybersecurity**]{.mark} matters
[or]{.mark} has shown [**little** **interest** **in**
**advancing**]{.mark} them in his committee, which oversees the
Department of Homeland Security, one of the government agencies most
focused on digital security.]{.underline}

Johnson came to Congress in 2010 touting his background in manufacturing
as the basis for his strong anti-regulatory bent, which critics say is a
chief reason he's resisted cyber bills that could enforce new standards
on industry. And since Donald Trump won the White House in 2016, the
senator has adopted many of the president's views --- such as
downplaying Russian interference in the last presidential election ---
and sought to focus on topics favored by conservatives.

"I think he's [[more interested in]{.mark} the waste, fraud and abuse,
and more the [political issues]{.mark}]{.underline}," a former committee
staffer told POLITICO. "[Immigration --- that's a political issue.

The [[**Pentagon** maintains]{.underline}]{.mark} these new

also [[fear]{.mark} that the [armed forces could **outstrip** NASA in

Aaron Boley, co-director of Outer Space Institute at the University of

are used to support military operations and global security.

"But once we move to the moon, this should really be driven by civilian
organizations to ensure that peaceful purposes are maintained," he said.

Some leading military strategists, however, say there is simply too much
at stake in the space race to leave it to civilians, and that the
Pentagon will likely be compelled to take on a bigger role.

China's space agency has made significant strides in its plan to develop
the moon, including landing the first spacecraft on the south pole in
2019. It also plans at least three additional robotic missions,
beginning in 2024, to build a lunar base, with missions involving
taikonauts to follow.

Proponents for a more muscular U.S. military say they fear China cannot
be trusted to pursue only peaceful aims and could use its space program
for both economic and military advantage, including a new partnership
with Russia to build a moon base.

"Power abhors a vacuum," said Peter Garretson, a retired Air Force
lieutenant colonel and space strategist who is now a senior fellow in
defense studies at the American Foreign Policy Council. "You should
expect that other actors will act in ways that favor their interests to
the exclusion of others."

"I think we all hope that NASA will rise to the occasion again and be
able to perform that traditional exploration role," he added. "But with
the slipping of budgets and slipping the timelines, I think there is
some concern as to whether or not NASA is scaling its efforts and will
be able to rise to the occasion."

The primary legal instrument for managing the militarization of outer
space is the 1967 **[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**uter
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**pace **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty.64
The treaty [[regulates]{.underline}]{.mark} space [exploration and

**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**estruction in space, [although [it does not
prohibit]{.mark} military
**[op]{.mark}**]{.underline}eration**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**
altogether.65 While the prospects for multilateral governance of space
seem grim, especially in context of current American policymaking, the
inception of the **[[Space Force]{.underline}]{.mark}** necessarily
[[raises questions about the future of]{.underline}]{.mark} multilateral
[management of [space]{.mark}]{.underline}. Will the
institutionalization of the Space Force make it easier or more difficult
to develop mechanisms for multilateral space governance?

Military [[services]{.underline}]{.mark} tend to [[warily]{.underline}
[view]{.underline}]{.mark} [**arms [control]{.mark}**
[arrangements]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that affect their
**auto­nomy**]{.mark} in their **specialized domains**.]{.underline} The
events described in the 1964 film (and 1962 novel) Seven Days in May, in
which an Air Force general seeks to topple an arms control--minded
American president in a coup, are overstated, but
[[services]{.underline}]{.mark} have historically [[opposed arms]{.mark}
control [limitations]{.mark}]{.underline} that affect their core
priorities. The Royal Air Force's preference for offensive bombing
doctrines during the interwar period, and its belief that the realities
of war would rapidly blow past any legal limitations, undoubtedly
influenced the United Kingdom's approach to international law in the
1920s and 1930s.66 Similarly, the [**U.S. [Navy]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}]{.underline}[([and]{.underline}]{.mark} [its
[counterparts]{.mark} in **Britain**, **Japan**]{.underline}, and
elsewhere) [[resented]{.mark} [the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**Washington
Naval Treaty** [process because it limited]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[construction]{.underline}]{.mark} of their most prized vessels.67

Even in the prehistory of the U.S. Air Force, Billy Mitchell warned
about the threat that international arms control might pose for aerial
bombardment. However, opposition to arms control was not always
automatic or immediate; the Army Air Forces chiefs offered qualified
support for nuclear arms control in the immediate aftermath of World War
II.68 By the early 1960s, however, the Air Force senior hierarchy
resolutely opposed most multilateral arms control, including the Limited
Test Ban Treaty, the Outer Space Treaty, and the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty.69 In part because of generational change, the
Air Force had minimal influence over the early Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Later
activism on the part of the Air Force and of the Navy focused on the
protection of specific systems, such as the B‑1 Lancer bomber, the
LGM-118 Peacekeeper ballistic missile (then the Missile, Experimental,
or MX), and the Trident submarine‐​launched ballistic missile.70

The reasoning behind this opposition is clear: Strategic bombing (and
later the delivery of nuclear payloads through intercontinental
ballistic missiles) provided the rationale for the autonomy,
independence, and primacy of the Air Force. [**[Limitation]{.mark}**
of]{.underline} these [weapons]{.underline} would not only require
significant revision of doctrine and force structure but also [[would
strike at the]{.mark} **core [cultural stories]{.mark}** []{.mark}that
undergirded the **services**]{.underline}. Moreover,
[**[compliance]{.mark}** with]{.underline} the [[restrictions of]{.mark}
a **[multilateral governance]{.mark}** regime [can be
onerous]{.mark}]{.underline} in terms of financial, human resources, and
intelligence demands.71 Most modern [arms limitation [regimes demand
**transparency**]{.mark}]{.underline} on the part of the participants,
[[which services tend not to welcome]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Given that services tend to pursue autonomy, the [Space
Force]{.underline} could [pose some obstacle to]{.underline} future
[efforts for]{.underline} multilateral [arms control in
space]{.underline}. To be sure, neither the navies nor the air forces of
the 20th century managed to prevent arms control. Nevertheless, if the
**[[Space Force]{.underline}]{.mark}** manages to acquire the
bureaucratic heft it needs to accomplish its core missions, it [[could

reasons for concern about the role that the Space Force could play in
future arms control negotiations. Services tend to resent the imposition
of external limits on their procurement and force structure, although
the extent of this resentment depends on organizational priorities.
Still, the Space Force is unlikely to spearhead a drive for arms control
within the U.S. government and probably will resist limitations imposed
by such arms control on its core interests.

Introduction: Satellites and Surveillance Capitalism \\\\SYang

On 4 October 1957, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics launched
Sputnik, the world's first artificial satellite. Humiliated by the
Soviet feat, the United States quickly countered, launching its Explorer
satellite on 31 January 1958. [On 29 July 1958, the US Congress then
passed the National Aeronautics Space Act, declaring that "activities in
space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of
humankind."1 Signed into law by US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the
Act established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
to conduct all non-military activity in outer space while also
incorporating elements of the US Army Ballistic Missile Agency and Naval
Research Laboratory. [NASA began its official operations on 1 October
1958, with a mission to create a space program based on]{.mark}
non-military and commercially promising satellites for scientific
research, [communications]{.mark}, terrain mapping, meteorological and
environmental monitoring, and other Earth resource
applications.]{.underline} Knowing that NASA's satellites would collect
images from countries other than the United States, the agency's
representatives also entered into cooperative agreements with US allies,
assuring other countries' representatives that NASA had peaceful
intentions.2 Sputnik-1, Explorer-1, the creation of NASA, and a quick
succession of additional satellite launches by the United States and the
USSR captured the imagination of technological enthusiasts around the
world. [As conspicuous political acts performed on the world stage
during the Cold War, [those launches]{.mark} also [inaugurated a global
space race, accelerated the arms race, and encouraged other nations to
compete for the military and commercial spoils of satellite
surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline}.3 In an agreement with the United
States, the United Kingdom soon entered the space race, sending its
Ariel satellite into orbit on 26 April 1962. Constructed by NASA at the
Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, and launched aboard an American
rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, Ariel
distinguished the United Kingdom as the third nation to send a satellite
into orbit. Damaged by an American high-altitude nuclear test, Ariel
never lived up to its promise. Nevertheless, the launch signalled the
United Kingdom's commitment to the development of a space program,
including a pledge to devote its efforts to peaceful scientific research
and commercial applications.4 On 29 September 1962, Canada followed the
United Kingdom into outer space, sending its Alouette satellite into
orbit aboard an American rocket launched from the Pacific Missile Range
at California's Vandenberg Air Force Base. Built by the Special Products
Applied Research (SPAR) division of de Havilland Aircraft of Canada, and
assembled by the Electronics Division of Canada's Defence Research
Telecommunications Establishment (DRTE), Alouette distinguished Canada
as the fourth country to launch and the third one to build a satellite.
Although several more years passed before satellite technologies reached
beyond military, government, and scientific communities, Canada
announced its stake in peaceful Earth observation, including its
intention to develop remote sensing technologies (to acquire information
via aerial photographs, satellite images, and other observation systems,
and to detect and classify objects and phenomena without making physical
contact with them). The country's policymakers also tied Canadians to
American developments, both signing continental trade and defence
sharing agreements as well as vigorously promoting space exploration,
scientific research, and the engineering disciplines as vital for
protecting both national and continental interests.5 As other nations
joined the space race over the next thirty years, developments in
computing, digitization, and satellite reconnaissance, imaging, and
communications pushed the boundaries of surveillance capitalism.
[[Following the]{.mark} formal [dissolution of the USSR]{.mark} on 26
December 1991, [Americans]{.mark} then [moved swiftly to commercialize
the Internet, deregulate communications]{.mark} and financial
industries, and [assist in the further liberalization of the global
economy]{.mark} and the evolving space industry.]{.underline} By the end
of 2012, NASA's National Space Science Data Center confirmed that more
than 6,600 satellites had launched into orbit since Sputnik, with the
vast majority of them reaching outer space after 1993.6 By 2012, Space
Security Index (SSI) reported that artificial orbiting objects had
reached approximately 8,300. The United States owned about half of all
active satellites, with fifty other countries and several international
consortia and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) owning the others.
Although satellites have declined in price, launching them remains
expensive. As a result, by the end of 2012, only nine countries and one
intergovernmental organization (the European Space Agency) had launching
capabilities, with the United States dominant. In 2011 alone, global
actors had embarked upon eighty space launches that placed 126 new
satellites into orbit, with participating nations contributing billions
of dollars to the effort. SSI further revealed that the International
Space Station (ISS) had already cost US\$100 billion, with most of it
paid for by the taxpayers who helped to fund billions of dollars' worth
of other space initiatives. "[Advanced and developing [economies]{.mark}
alike [depend on these space-based systems]{.mark}," SSI observed, [with
commercial space revenues "steadily" increasing]{.mark} "since the
mid-1990s. From satellite manufacturing and launch services to advanced
navigation products and the provision of satellite-based
communications," SSI declared, "the global commercial space industry is
thriving, with estimated annual revenues in excess of \$200
billion."]{.underline}7 SSI also disclosed that operational satellites
accounted for fewer than 5 per cent of the objects orbiting the Earth
during 2012, while the remaining 95 per cent represented orbital debris
due to anti-missile testing, accidents, and dead batteries.8 One of
China's older weather satellites is among that debris, blown out of the
sky in January 2007 when the Chinese conducted their first test of an
anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) and, according to one commercial space
writer, put "other nations on notice that their commercial and military
space assets were vulnerable to attack."9 As part of an article on
Sapphire, Canada's first military satellite, the commercial space writer
mentioned neither the fifty-year history of US and USSR anti-missile
testing nor the more recent space-based collisions and accidents cited
by Space Security Index as central to the creation of orbital debris.
Regardless, the article reflected a trend among business-friendly space
writers employing national security concerns to justify increased
budgets and private-public initiatives for ASAT detection, "collision
avoidance maneuvers," and "debris mitigation efforts."10 All of these
initiatives now promise to become as significant as satellite launches
and what their information-gathering capabilities have revealed about
the Earth and its people, with "rapidly increasing revenues associated
with satellite services" and the protection of commercial space systems
linked to the government contractors who manufacture and maintain the
satellites, ground receiving stations, advanced navigational products,
and security systems that receive data for both civilian and military
users.11 This book weaves the history of one of those government
contractors -- Canada's MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) --
into a larger narrative about the ways in which the forces of
surveillance capitalism integrated Canada into regional, industrial,
academic, and military alliances, particularly but not exclusively with
the United States. Founded in Vancouver, British Columbia, during 1969,
MDA evolved from a four-person software consultancy into a multinational
supplier of space-based systems. A significant provider of the world's
ground stations that receive, process, archive, and exploit satellite
data, MDA received global recognition in the 1970s for its pioneering
work in the commercial applications of remote sensing and synthetic
aperture radar (SAR, a high-resolution device that provides surface
mapping no matter the weather conditions, cloud cover, or levels of
darkness). MDA also became the prime contractor for Canada's powerful
Radarsat-2 Earth observation satellite and the official data distributor
for Radarsat images worldwide. Other notable feats include MDA's global
delivery of the navigational systems that support aircraft and unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs, commonly known as drones), as well as its role as
primary builder of Sapphire, and central contributor to Canadarm-2 (the
remote manipulator component of the robotic, mobile servicing system
that moves equipment and supplies around the International Space Station
and supports astronauts working in space). MDA has additionally received
credit as the incubator for Vancouver's high-technology corridor, with
many of the firm's former employees launching some of British Columbia's
most successful technology ventures. Of the surviving firms, most work
as important surveillance-related government contractors in their own
right.12 As Canadians celebrated the fifty-year anniversary of
Alouette-1, and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) readied the nation for
the launch of Sapphire at the end of 2012, MDA's strategies culminated
in the acquisition of the US Space Systems/Loral (SS/L), a global
provider of communications satellites and subsystems. According to
industry analysts, the SS/L acquisition furnished MDA with a "critical
mass in the commercial satellite manufacturing industry."13 When the
deal closed on 2 November 2012, MDA had also created one of the world's
most significant communications and information systems integrators, an
achievement that promised "to boost estimated earnings" and provide "a
platform to win upcoming space contracts" and more "defence and
intelligence work" from the US government. The US government soon
fulfilled that promise, in multiple contracts that gave MDA the market
value and visibility its executives and shareholders had long craved as
"the top technology stock in Canada over the past year."14 Although
financial news reports finally acknowledged MDA's significance to
Canada's place within the global surveillance power core, the firm still
remains largely invisible in the historical record and to the general
public. According to David Ebner of the Globe and Mail, MDA's obscurity
has much to do with the ephemeral nature of systems engineering. Whereas
one can touch and see products, MDA's "technology isn't widely
recognized by most people because" the firm "generally operates unseen,
in the background," Ebner argued. As a result, "when MDA's Radarsat
satellites monitor Canada -- the surveillance can spotlight down to a
single metre -- there isn't any obvious MDA or Made in Canada stamp that
people can see or cheer."15 Operating "unseen, in the background," MDA
has played a critical role in the long-term development of the
information systems and [[products that proliferate in global
positioning devices, flight navigation systems, drones, mobile
satellites]{.mark}, Command, Control, Communications, Computers,
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance ([C4ISR]{.mark}, also
known as "Battle Command"), and a host of other networks that
[dominate]{.mark} various [industries, from communications and financial
services to environmental monitoring and resource
extraction]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although they did not initially work on
surveillance technologies for overtly political reasons, MDA's
scientists and engineers also played a part in turning satellites into a
multi-billion-dollar commodity and outer space into a competitive,
militarized zone. Along with other technological enthusiasts, they
embraced satellites, the commercialization of space, and a notion of the
"end of ideology." In practice, however, [[their work has contributed to
the expansion of the neoliberal project of privatization,]{.mark} fiscal
austerity, deregulation, fr[ee trade,]{.mark} and reduced social
spending, as well as the use of [more efficient data mining systems,
precision surveillance,]{.mark} first-strike capabilities, [and the use
of robotics for]{.mark} commerce as well as [war]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Engineering systems such as the ones they developed have also helped to
remove the last barriers to routine aerial surveillance and the
monitoring of everyday life. It would be a mistake, however, to see
MDA's founders, executives, scientists, and engineers as principal
architects of this change; recent scholarship on the importance of
social capital networks as well as ongoing revelations about
surveillance and military-industrial adventurism have exploded the myths
that a bright line divides business from government and the "great" man
or woman from the socially constructed universe in which they operate.
That MDA existed at all made it an entrepreneurial enterprise: the first
of its kind in Vancouver, the firm helped to establish a hightechnology
presence in BC's Lower Mainland. But MDA's history also reveals that
business enterprises succeed or fail not simply on technological
innovation, the personal qualities of those who lead them, the
first-mover advantages that early entrants enjoy, or the "visible hand"
of executives and managers who develop strategies and structures for
continued expansion. Indeed, business survival always reflects the
contingencies of larger social structures and cultural tropes,
government priorities and changing educational, legal, and political
policies, and unanticipated events and exogenous shocks beyond the
control of any inventor, business founder, investor, executive, worker,
government bureaucrat, or policymaking body. No different, MDA depended
on these phenomena as well as the taxpayers who supported government
spending on surveillance and those who hoped to profit from enhanced
information-gathering techniques. "Without the benevolence" of the
Canadian government, one long-time employee suggested, "MDA would never
have grown beyond the size of a very, very small company."16 MDA's
history therefore reminds us that corporations are juridical constructs
and entrepreneurs instruments of state power, with both providing ways
for governments to spread risk and for gatekeepers to favour certain
individuals and businesses over others. By placing surveillance
capitalism at the centre of Canada's political economy, this book argues
that MDA matters to our understanding of poilcymaking and
business-government relations during the Cold War and into the
twenty-first century. Reflecting the assumptions of capitalism's culture
of individual striving, people at MDA hoped to profit from living and
working in a society where government officials promised to nurture
their technical skills, reward their surveillance-based work, and bail
them out when they stumbled. No matter their technical, business, or
political skills, some realized their ambitions while others did not.
Some had the ability to sell their ideas and motivate others, but lacked
the skills to make the firm a profitable one. Others had excellent
negotiating, managerial, and marketing skills, but still failed to
realize returns from the "best practices" they had learned from
management literature and the experiences of others in similar
circumstances. Always, they engaged in complex negotiations with the
capitalist system and government policies that provided incentive for
some activities and discouraged others. MDA survived because members of
the firm's evolving executive team ultimately embraced MDA's role as a
systems integrator and procurement contractor for governments worldwide.
Over time, they also understood that power resided not in the
technologies they developed but rather in Ottawa and Washington, DC.
Once done, they learned how to lobby the government to keep Canada's
space program on the budgetary agenda. In turn, the federal government
encouraged MDA's surveillance-based work because it promised to expand
Canada's influence as a significant, albeit junior member of the
international power club. Canadian policymakers also appreciated that
"countries which have less competitive industrial strengths in the areas
of information technology face an increasing risk of losing trade,
influence and economic power both within the community of developed
nations and in the broader context of trade with developing
countries."17 MDA therefore provides more than a case study about how
one particular firm managed to survive in the competitive space
industry; it serves as a window into a corporate world girded by potent
forces at the nexus of state, capital, and geopolitical power games.
That nexus has included myths about space exploration's peaceful
purposes as well as competitive posturing for the spoils of
surveillance-based commerce. Largely well-intentioned and with little
interest in war, people at MDA nevertheless got caught up in the
excitement of technological development, capitalist ambitions, and state
incentives for both. Their eventual move into military work also
reflects the unique security but problematic cultural relationship that
integrated Canada into a continental defence economy with the United
States while members of each country struggled to define their national
identities and the imperial role each would play during the Cold War and
beyond. As that relationship played out, Canadians consistently feared
the overwhelming influence of their more powerful southern neighbours.
Whether Conservative or Liberal, policymakers thus attempted to protect
Canadian sovereignty and an autonomous international identity while
simultaneously enjoying the benefits of their geographical proximity to
as well as trading relationship with the United States. They also
concerned themselves with foreign investment in the Canadian economy and
the brain drain of technical talent that such investments might
engender. Hoping to realize a "fair share" of the bounty promised by
participation in world trade organizations and international governing
bodies, they additionally wrestled with balancing desires to project
Canada's peacekeeping role and the realities of the country's place
within the American military-industrial complex. Satellites played a
prominent role in that struggle. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SATELLITES,
SOVEREIGNTY, AND SURVEILLANCE STUDIES [[Artificial satellites]{.mark},
those [ubiquitous "eyes in the sky,"]{.mark} twinkle as stars in various
orbits. Some stand alone; others work in constellations. All [contain
powerful computers and subsystems]{.mark}, including those for
propulsion, power, and communications. They vary in size and purpose,
but ultimately they all [gather information]{.mark}, with each of them
launched to perform particular jobs [for military]{.mark} and commercial
[purposes]{.mark}, often both. Whether for [reconnaissance, remote
sensing, or communications,]{.mark} [satellites track assets]{.mark},
map resources, [and communicate information]{.mark} to users on Earth
and in outer space. In constant competition, those who own satellites
[seek to]{.mark} create more powerful features and [capture more
information for]{.mark} their own uses and [profit]{.mark}, for "without
a comparable capability," one Canadian task force on satellite
surveillance stressed, "we may never learn what other nations know about
us, which must be viewed as a serious non-military
threat."]{.underline}18 [Governments and their private contractors use
reconnaissance (or spy) satellites to gather intelligence on military
and other activities in outer space and on Earth.]{.underline} Launched
into polar orbit, the most powerful among them can cover the entire
globe every fourteen days. They come in four basic varieties and
interact with each other. Optical-imaging satellites use light sensors
to detect missile launches and weapons on the ground. Radar satellites
use synthetic aperture radar to see through clouds and darkness.
Signals-intelligence satellites employ powerful receivers to capture
radio and microwave transmissions from every foe and friend. [[Relay
satellites quickly move data]{.mark} from spy satellites to military
bases on Earth, thereby [speeding up the communications process]{.mark}
for engagement. As surveillance studies scholars remind us,
reconnaissance satellites are very useful tools for militaries and the
police-security state.]{.underline}19 Remote sensing (also known as
Earth observation) satellites measure and photograph the surface of the
Earth and oceans as well as the atmosphere. Like most non-military
satellites, Earth observation satellites typically launch into
geostationary orbit over the equator. They use sensor technologies to
detect objects and other phenomena via electromagnetic radiation signals
from aircraft, satellites, and other systems, taking pictures of and
classifying those objects without having to make physical contact with
them. With SAR onboard, remote sensing satellites can map the entire
surface of the Earth in the same ways that sonar technologies map the
oceans, day or night, in all weather. Google Earth provides just one
example of their power. Because they are very expensive to launch, Earth
observation satellites are funded and used mainly by governments, to
detect mineral and oil deposits, changes in agricultural activities and
forests, weather damage, military bases, submarine wakes in the ocean,
and other assets. MDA's Radarsat-2, launched into the sun-synchronous
polar orbit during 2007, can cover the Arctic daily, Canada every
seventy-two hours, and the entire Earth every twenty-four days. The
Canadian government has given MDA the right to sell Radarsat images to
others around the world, as an export for economic development. MDA can
downlink images to multiple ground stations in real time, or store them
in the satellite's computer until within range of a ground station.
[Once other countries, companies, and individuals have those images,
they too can see resources, thereafter exploiting them for various
applications, including city and regional planning, resource extraction,
market segmentation, intelligence work, warfare, and a host of other
reputable and nefarious activities.]{.underline}20 Most communications
satellites also launch into geostationary orbit so they can circle the
Earth within the same time that the Earth rotates just once. With their
powerful antennas, these satellites send radio, television, and
telephone transmissions, so that the Earth-bound can receive live
broadcasts, use cellular telephones, and communicate by e-mail, among
other activities. [[All of these devices record activities, making it
easier for their owners to share information with each
other.]{.underline}]{.mark} 21 There are many other satellites,
including those used for astronomy, meteorology, navigation, search and
rescue, space exploration, and other scientific applications. Working
interactively with the space stations that make living in outer space
possible, as well as with aircraft (including drones), ground-based
computers, multimedia platforms, geographical positioning systems (GPS),
and other technologies, [**[satellites have created the panoptical
architecture for the global surveillance state]{.mark} we experience and
serve, all the [while increasing the power of the elite who own and
control]{.mark} the [technologies]{.mark} and firms that produce them.**
[As]{.mark} Michel [Foucault observed, surveillance networks make us
self-policing subjects. We]{.mark} daily [use technologies we can no
longer seem to do without]{.mark}, whether on the job, through the cash
register, or at the ballot box. [We "check in" with authority figures,
even perform for them. We congregate with online communities]{.mark}
because we have few public spaces left to meet. **[We trade civil
liberties for protection because we receive daily reminders that we live
in a dangerous world.]{.mark}** [We consign our control to the awesome
power of the networks and inanimate objects created to extend
shareholder value and the power of the elite.]{.mark} Ultimately,
[we]{.mark} even [connect our identities to machines]{.mark}, watching,
touching, and speaking into them, inviting them to become one with
us.]{.underline}22 [Investigative journalist Christian Parenti has
argued that we do all of these things [because surveillance
techniques]{.mark} developed in earlier eras [have gone global, become
ubiquitous, "mundane, decentralized, and even convenient."]{.mark}23 The
conveniences of [surveillance technologies come at a price]{.mark}, just
as earlier conveniences came at a price to those enthralled by railroads
and telegraphs, automobiles and radios, and airplanes and televisions.
[Technological revolutions have created great wealth, but]{.mark} they
have [not]{.mark} necessarily effected [a greater distribution]{.mark}
of that wealth or a more peaceful and inclusive world.]{.underline} "If
the twentieth century has shown us anything," Joel Mokyr concluded in
his intellectual history of technology and the "useful" knowledge
economy, "it is that the capacity of humans for intolerance, stupidity,
and selfishness has not declined as their technological power has
increased." He also conceded, "The institutional setup of the world is
such that holdouts that reject modern technology or cannot adopt it will
eventually have to change their minds." Canadian policymakers therefore
embraced space exploration and surveillance technologies as a way to
maintain Canada's sovereignty and relevance, marketing both on their
abilities to create a "new" world order of economic and social
opportunities without end.24 Sociologist Vincent Mosco captured the
force of such strategies a decade ago while tracing the dot-com bust of
the late 1990s to the seductive power of the Internet. With Internet
enthusiasts demonstrating "a remarkable, almost willful, historical
amnesia," Mosco observed that each generation "has renewed the belief
that, whatever was said about earlier technologies, the latest one will
fulfill a radical and revolutionary promise." As a result, when the
dot-com bubble burst, many Internet enthusiasts were shocked to learn
that the power structures they thought they had overthrown remained
remarkably resilient.25 MDA's history resonates with these findings.
Thanks to the mythological power of space exploration, MDA's engineers
and scientists thought they were different from previous generations,
that their technical expertise could insulate them from past imbroglios.
After all, they reasoned, they were well-educated, scientifically adept,
computer-literate professionals, the vanguard of a new economy. 26
People from all walks of life rationalize their decisions and choose
selective memories to make sense of their current circumstances and
imagine themselves as active agents of the systems they develop and the
structures they support. But as social anthropologist Hylton [White
recently observed, in an environment structured for competition and
unending expansion, [capitalism inevitably turns each new wave of
technological enthusiasm]{.mark}, every gadget and new profession from
an exotic first [to a ubiquitous necessity]{.mark}.]{.underline} 27 This
is just one of the consequences of the willful innocence people at MDA
and elsewhere possess. In her study of engineering and the legitimacy of
state power, sociologist Chandra Mukerji has argued that "the
intelligence of engineering is not just pragmatic, but also deeply
invested in social, legal, and moral conceptions of power" that
privilege efficiencies over ecological awareness and quality-of-life
issues as well as "produce an engineered world that shapes our lives --
in ways we systematically ignore."28 Surveillance studies scholars
concur, including David Lyon, whose work continues to stress that
surveillance is a "morally and politically loaded activity," with what
"we disclose to whom, and under what conditions" a highly significant
act of state power. 29 Sociologists and surveillance studies scholars
have contributed a great deal to our understanding about the synergies
between capitalism, state power, military aims, academic research, and
technological change, particularly in the Internet era. With few
exceptions, however, most tend to focus on the United States, the United
Kingdom, and other "great powers" while remaining remarkably silent on
the history of the secondary powers that have helped to serve the
interests of capital and the hegemonic ambitions of the United States.
They also have the propensity to explore the state without examining the
businesses involved in the space-faring enterprise. This omission flows,
in part, from the classified nature of defence-related work; however,
disparate sources can help to connect the dots between governments and
their surveillance contractors. Tug of War draws upon interviews I
conducted with MDA's founders, employees past and present, and
government patrons during 1992--93, and prior to MDA's larger leap into
the secret world of international defence/military contracting. Once
transcribed, the tapes of those interviews produced an oral history of
more than 1,000 pages. As I reread and reflected on that oral history
after the heady dot-com boom had busted, terrorists had flown airplanes
with sophisticated flight information systems into the World Trade
Center and Pentagon, and the US government had stepped up its war
footing, ultimately invading Iraq in 2003 on manipulated intelligence
derived from military briefings and private contractors, I knew I had a
larger story to tell. I therefore turned to archival material at Library
and Archives Canada (LAC), some of it received through several requests
under the Freedom of Information and Protection Act, as well as publicly
available business records, government documents, and other sources that
could place MDA's trajectory within the larger context of surveillance
capitalism's expansion, the Cold War's emphasis on permanent military
preparedness and continental integration, and the rise of the North
American security state. Interviewees who spoke about MDA's first decade
focused on the excitement of their technological innovations. Those who
discussed the 1980s and early 1990s emphasized the business strategies
and structures MDA had instituted to survive the winds of technological
change and global competition, including the pull of military
contracting. And documents collected after MDA went public in 1993
disclosed the ways in which the firm capitalized on neoliberalism,
systems integration, and the expansion of the world's surveillance
architecture. Together, these sources have given me the luxury of
hindsight, an increasing appreciation about the concatenation of events
that pulled MDA into surveillance capitalism and a larger tug of war,
and a better understanding about the ways in which time, memory, and
selective amnesia shape the histories we tell ourselves and others over
time.30 The MDA case therefore demonstrates that historians have much to
contribute to the field of surveillance studies, particularly when they
search for sources that allow them to trace how [[those]{.mark}
asserting no particular interest in gaining military power nevertheless
[get drawn into]{.mark} the promises of [space exploration]{.mark},
larger [state objectives, and the US military-industrial
complex.]{.mark}]{.underline}31

launches, [satellites]{.mark}, and space infrastructure
[downwards]{.mark}]{.underline}, exerting what industry insiders call
the 'SpaceX effect\' (Henry, 2018), centered on the technological
achievement of 'reusability\', recovering used rocket boosters for
additional launches, promising to drastically reduce the price of going
to space (Morring, 2016). As one report observes, 'Not only has the
number of private companies engaged in space exploration grown
remarkably in recent years, these companies are quickly besting their
government-sponsored competitors\' (Houser, 2017). What the rockets,
shuttles, ships, and landing pods will carry beneath their payload
fairing or in their cargo hold, however, along with supplies and
satellites, is the capitalist worldview, a particular ideology---just as
Robinson Crusoe, in Marx's ironic retelling in Capital, 'having saved a
watch, ledger, ink and pen from the shipwreck... soon begins, like a
good Englishman, to keep a set of books\' (Marx, 1976, p. 170), brings
with him English political economy---\'Freedom, Equality, Property and
Bentham\', as Marx (1976, p. 280) says elsewhere---to his desert island.

In early 2018, astronomers across the world learned that a New Zealand
start-up, Rocket Lab, which aimed to launch thousands of miniature
satellites into orbit around Earth (so-called 'smallsats\'), had planned
to launch a giant, shining 'disco ball\'---the 'Humanity Star\'---into
orbit around Earth. It was an elaborate marketing stunt masked by
humanistic idealism. 'No matter where you are in the world, or what is
happening in your life\', said Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck, 'everyone will
be able to see the Humanity Star in the night sky\' (Amos, 2018). Many
astronomers expressed outrage at these plans, fearing that the light
from the Human Star would threaten their ability to carry out scientific
observations. But while these astronomers were incensed by the idea of a
bright geodesic object disrupting their ability to carry out
observations, [concerns with the effects of the arrival of
capitalistkind on their ability to collect data were non-existent. [The
astronomical community]{.mark} was angered by the idea of a material,
concrete, visible object polluting "pure" scientific data, but it [paid
less attention to the]{.mark} (invisible and abstract) [recuperation of
the night sky as it was brought into the fold of
capitalism.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In an interview, Beck was quizzed about the Humanity Star and asked by a
reporter about the difficulties of generating profits in space (Tucker,
2018). To this Beck replied, 'It has always been a government domain,
but we're witnessing the democratization of it...\[I\]t \[is\] turning
into a commercially dominated domain\'. Beck established an equivalence
established between the dissolution of space as the rightful domain of
states and the advent of profit-making ventures as signs of
'democratization\'. In space, according to Beck's logic, democratization
involves the disappearance of the state and the rise of capital. The
argument, of course, is impeccably post-statist: on this account, states
are monolithic, conservative Leviathans beyond the reach of popular
control; corporations, on the other hand, are in principle
representatives of the everyman: in the age of the start-up, any humble
citizen could in theory become an agent of disruption, a force for
change, an explorer of space, and a potential member of the cadre of
capitalistkind. [Following this logic, [the question for]{.mark} the
entrepreneurs of [NewSpace is how to monetize outer space,]{.mark} which
means [turning space into a space for capital]{.mark}; their question is
how they can [deplanetarize capital and universalize it]{.mark},
literally speaking, that is, turn the Universe into a universe for
capital. In this light, Peter Beck's distortion of democratic ideals
appears eminently sensible, equating democratization with monetization,
that is, capital liberated from its earthly tethers.]{.underline}

Emblematic of this capitalist turn in space was the founding of Moon
Express in 2011, composed of a 'team of prominent Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs...shooting for the moon with a new private venture aimed
at scouring the lunar surface for precious metals and rare metallic
elements\' (Hennigan, 2011). Following Google's Lunar XPRIZE---an
intertwining of Silicon Valley and NewSpace's capitalistkind---which
promised a \$20 million prize for the first private company to land a
spacecraft on the Moon, travel 500 meters, and transmit high-definition
images back to Earth, all by March 2018,Footnote9 Moon Express claimed
that it would be capable of landing on the lunar surface and earn the
cash prize. Their stated goal was twofold: first, to mine rare resource
like Helium-3 (a steadily dwindling scarce resources on Earth), gold,
platinum group metals, and water, and, second, to carry out scientific
work that would 'help researchers develop human space colonies for
future generations\' (Ioannou, 2017). The ordering is telling: first
profits, then humanity. These were the hollow, insubstantial promises of
a venture-capitalized NewSpace enterprise: in early 2018, Google
announced that none of the five teams competing for the Lunar XPRIZE,
including Moon Express, would reach their stated objectives by the 31
March deadline and they were taking their money back (Grush, 2018). In
this sense, it was typical for NewSpace in its formative years: a
corporate field populated by (overly exuberant) private enterprises who
promised more than they could deliver. But the belief in NewSpace is
real enough. In a tome bursting with the optimism of NewSpace, Wohlforth
and Hendrix claim that 'the commercial spaceflight industry is
transforming our sense of possibility. Using Silicon Valley's money and
innovative confidence, it will soon bring mass space products to the
market\' (2016, p. 7).

The trope of humanity plays a key role in the rhetoric of the adherents
of NewSpace. To fulfill the objectives of NewSpace, including profit
maximization and the exploitation of celestial bodies, the symbolic
figure of a shared humanity serves a useful purpose, camouflaging the
conquest of space by capitalism with a dream of humanity boldly
venturing forth into the dark unknown, thereby also providing the
legitimacy and enthusiasm needed to support bolster the legitimacy of
NewSpace. So long as the stargazers and SpaceX watchers are permitted
their fill of 'collective effervescence\', to use Durkheim's (1995, p.
228) concept, capitalist entrepreneurs will be able to pursue their
business interests more or less as they please. The spectacle of outer
space is crucial in this regard.

Crucially, however, and despite this spectacle, SpaceX's technology
might not necessarily be more sophisticated than its competitors or
predecessors. Some industry insiders have rebuffed some of the more the
spectacular claims of NewSpace's proponents, arguing that launch vehicle
reusability requires a (perhaps prohibitively) expensive refurbishing of
the rocket engines involved in launches: 'The economics will depend on
how many times a booster can be flown, and how much the individual
expense will be to refurbish the booster...each time\' (Chang, 2017).
Reusability may be a technological dead-end because of the inherently
stressful effects of a rocket launch on the launch vehicle's components,
with extreme limitations on reusability beyond second-use as well as
added risks of malfunctions that customers and insurers are likely to
wish to avoid. Furthermore, the Falcon Heavy still has not matched the
power and payload capacity of NASA's Saturn V, a product of 1960s
military-industrial engineering and Fordist state spending programs.
What SpaceX and other NewSpace corporations do with great ingenuity,
however, is to manage the spectacle of outer space, producing
outpourings of public fervor, aided by a widespread adherence to the
'Californian Ideology\' (Barbrook and Cameron, 1996), or post-statist
techno-utopianism, in many postindustrialized societies.

The very centrality of these maneuvers has initiated a new phase in the
history of capitalist relations, that of 'charismatic
accumulation\'---certainly not in the sense of any 'objective\' or
inherent charismatic authority, but with a form of illusio, to speak
with Bourdieu, vested in the members of capitalistkind by their uncanny
ability to spin mythologizing self-narratives. This has always been part
of the capitalist game, from Henry Ford and onwards, but the charismatic
mission gains a special potency in the grandiose designs of NewSpace's
entrepreneurs. Every SpaceX launch is a quasi-religious spectacle,
observed by millions capable of producing a real sense of wonder in a
condition of (legitimizing) collective effervescence.

[[Outer space necessarily reduces inter-human difference to a common
denominator or a shared species-being]{.mark}.]{.underline} An important
leitmotiv in many Hollywood science fiction movies, including Arrival
(2016), is that a first encounter with an alien species of intelligent
beings tends to flatten all human difference (including ethnoracial and
national categories), thereby restoring humankind to its proper
universality (see also Novoa, 2016). Ambassadors of Earth as a whole,
not representatives of particular nations, step forth to meet alien
emissaries. But even in the absence of such an encounter, the search for
habitable domains (or rather, profitable locales) beyond Earth will
necessarily forge a shared conception of the human condition, initiated
with the Pale Blue Dot photograph in 1990. Typical of this sentiment are
the words of the astronomer Carl Sagan, who famously observed of this
photograph: 'On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you
ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives\'.

[[This naïvely humanistic vision has been]{.mark} one of [the dominant
tropes in the discourse on space]{.mark} since the 1950s, and it remains
strong today, as with the claims of the United Nations Office for Outer
Space Affairs (UNOOSA) that their task is to 'uphold the vision of a
more equitable future for all humankind through shared achievements in
space\'. This [representational tendency mobilizes humanism to generate
enthusiasm]{.mark} about space-related activities. But [such
representations are]{.mark} increasingly [being recuperated by
capitalist enterprise, so that it is not humankind]{.mark} but its
modulation by space capitalists that will launch into the dark unknown.
It is not humankind [but capitalistkind that ventures
forth]{.mark}.]{.underline} In early 2018, NASA was set to request \$150
million in its 2019 budget to 'enable the development and maturation of
commercial entities and capabilities which will ensure that commercial
successors to the ISS...are operational when they are needed\', only one
of many signs that space is becoming a space for capitalism. According
to one estimate, the value of just one single asteroid would be more
than \$20 trillion in rare earth and platinum-group metals (Lewis,
1996), a precious prize indeed for profit-hungry corporations.Footnote10
Even the UNOOSA spoke vociferously in favor of the commercialization of
space, appealing variously to the 'industry and private sector\' and
elevating the 'space economy\' to a central pillar in its Space2030
Agenda (including the 'use of resources that create and provide value
and benefits to the world population in the course of exploring,
understanding and utilizing space\'), even as the UN agency falls back
on a humanistic, almost social-democratic vision of the equitable
distribution of benefits (and profits) from space mining, exploration,
and colonization (UNOOSA, 2018).

We find evidence of this strategic humanism in all manner of
pronouncements from NewSpace entrepreneurs. To take but one example:
Naveen Jain, the chairman and co-founder of MoonEx, a lunar
commercialization firm, has claimed that 'from an entrepreneur's
perspective, the moon has never truly been explored\'. The moon, Jain
has claimed, 'could hold resources that benefit Earth and all humanity\'
(Hennigan, 2011). We should note the recourse to the trope of all of
humanity by this NewSpace entrepreneur, mimicked in the 1979 Moon
Agreement, a UN treaty, which also held that the Moon's resources are
'the common heritage of mankind\' (Tronchetti, 2013, p. 13).Footnote11
In a purely factual sense, of course, Jain is wrong: Google Moon offers
high-resolution images of the lunar surface,Footnote12 and the moon has
already been explored, in the sense of being mapped, albeit
rudimentarily and with room for further data collection. Crucially,
however, these cartographic techniques have not been put to capitalist
uses: mapping minerals, for instance, or producing detailed schemata
that might one day turn the Moon into a 'gas station\' for commercial
space ventures, as Wilbur Ross, Trump's Secretary of Commerce, has
proposed (Bryan, 2018). What is lacking, in short, are capitalist maps
of the Moon, i.e., a cartography for capital. But as Klinger (2017: 199)
notes, even though no one is 'actively mining the Moon\' at present, at
least 'six national space programs, fifty private firms, and one
graduate engineering program, are intent on figuring out how to do so\';
furthermore, Klinger draws attention to mapping efforts that have
revealed high an abundance of rare earth metals, thorium, and iron in
the Moon's 'Mare Procellarum KREEP\' region (Klinger, 2017, p. 203).

We have already noted that it is not humanity, conceived as
species-being, a Gattungswesen, that makes its way into space. The term
Gattungswesen, of course, has a long intellectual pedigree, harking back
to Hegel, Feuerbach, Marx, and others. The term can 'be naturally
applied both to the individual human being and to the common nature or
essence which resides in every individual man and woman\', Allan Wood
(2004, p. 17) writes, as well as 'to the entire human race, referring to
humanity as a single collective entity or else to the essential property
which characterizes this entity and makes it a single distinctive thing
in its own right\'. Significantly, the adherents of NewSpace often
resort to the idea of humanity in its broad universality (e.g., Musk,
2017), but this denies and distorts the modulation of humanity by its
imbrication with the project of global (and post-global, i.e.,
space-bound) capitalism. [[It is]{.mark} precisely [the sort of false
universality implied in]{.mark} the humanism of the supporters of
[NewSpace that Marx subjected to a scathing critique]{.mark} in the
sixth of his Theses on Feuerbach. Here Marx noted that [the human
essence is not made up of some 'abstraction inherent in each single
individual\']{.mark} (1998, p. 570[). Instead, humans are defined by the
'ensemble of social relations\']{.mark} in which they are enmeshed.
Under [NewSpace,]{.mark} it is not humanity, plain and simple, that
[ventures forth,]{.mark} but [a specific set of capitalist
entrepreneurs, carrying a particular ideological payload]{.mark},
alongside their satellites, instruments, and supplies, a point noted by
other sociologists of outer space, or 'astrosociologists\' (Dickens and
Ormrod, 2007a, 2007b).]{.underline}

The spatial fix of outer space

[[No longer terra nullius, space is now the new terra firma of
capitalistkind]{.mark}: its naturalized terroir, its next necessary
terrain. [The logic of capitalism dictates that capital should seek to
expand outwards]{.mark} into the vastness of space, a point recognized
by a recent ethnography of NewSpace actors (Valentine, 2016, p. 1050).
[The operations]{.mark} of capitalistkind [serve to resolve a series of
(]{.mark}potential) [crises of capitalism, revolving around]{.mark} the
slow, steady decline of **[spatial fixes]{.mark}** (see e.g., Harvey,
1985, p. 51--66) as they come crashing up against the quickly vanishing
blank spaces remaining on earthly maps and declining (terrestrial)
opportunities for profitable investment of surplus capital (Dickens and
Ormrod, 2007a, p. 49--78).]{.underline}

[A '[spatial fix\' involves the geographic modulation of capital
accumulation]{.mark}, consisting in the outward expansion of capital
onto new geographic terrains, or into new spaces, with the aim of
filling a gap in the home terrains of capital. Jessop (2006, p. 149)
notes that spatial fixes may [involve a number of strategies, including
the creation of new markets within the capitalist world]{.mark},
engaging in trade with non-capitalist economies, and exporting surplus
capital to undeveloped or underdeveloped regions. The first two address
the problem of insufficient demand and the latter option creates a
productive (or valorizing) outlet for excess capital. [Capitalism must
regularly discover]{.mark}, develop, and appropriate such [new spaces
because of its inherent tendency to generate surplus capital]{.mark},
i.e., capital bereft of profitable purpose. In Harvey's (2006, p. xviii)
terms, a spatial fix revolves around 'geographical expansions and
restructuring...as a temporary solution to crises understood...in terms
of the overaccumulation of capital\'. [It is a temporary solution
because]{.mark} these newly [appropriated spaces will]{.mark} in turn
[become exhausted]{.mark} of profitable potential and are likely to
produce their own stocks of surplus capital;]{.underline} while 'capital
surpluses that otherwise stood to be devalued, could be absorbed through
geographical expansions and spatio-temporal displacements\' (Harvey,
2006, p. xviii), this outwards drive of capitalism is inherently
limitless: there is no end point or final destination for capitalism.
Instead, capitalism must continuously propel itself onwards in search of
pristine sites of renewed capital accumulation. In this way, Harvey
writes, society constantly 'creates fresh productive powers elsewhere to
absorb its overaccumulated capital\' (Harvey, 1981, p. 8).

[Historically, [spatial fixes have played an important role in
conserving the capitalist system]{.mark}. As Jessop (2006, p. 149)
points out, 'The export of surplus money capital, surplus commodities,
and/or surplus labour-power outside the space(s) where they originate
[enabled capital to avoid]{.mark}, at least for a period, [the threat of
devaluation\']{.mark}. But these new spaces for capital are not
necessarily limited to physical terrains, as with colonial expansion in
the nineteenth century; as Greene and Joseph (2015) note, [various
digital spaces]{.mark}, such as the Internet, can also be considered as
spatial fixes: the Web [absorbs overaccumulated capital]{.mark},
heightens consumption of virtual and physical goods, and makes
inexpensive, flexible sources of labor available to employers. Greene
and Joseph offer [the example of online high-speed frequency
trading]{.mark} as a digital spatial fix that furthers the 'annihilation
of space by time\' first noted by Marx in his Grundrisse (see Marx,
1973, p. 524).]{.underline}

[[Outer space]{.mark} serves at least two [purposes]{.mark} in this
regard. In the short-to medium-term, it allows [for the export of
surplus capital into emerging industries]{.mark}, such as satellite
imaging and communication. These are significant sites of capital
accumulation: global revenues in the worldwide satellite market in 2016
amounted to \$260 billion (SIA, 2017, p. 4). Clearly, much of this
activity is taking place 'on the ground\'; it is occurring in the
'terrestrial economy\'. But all that capital would have to find some
other meaningful or productive outlet were it not for the expansion of
capital into space. Second, outer space serves as [an arena of
technological innovation, which feeds back into the terrestrial economy,
helping to avert crisis]{.mark} by pushing capital out of technological
stagnation and innovation shortfalls.]{.underline}

[In short, [outer space serves as a spatial fix]{.mark}. It [swallows up
surplus capital,]{.mark} promising to deliver valuable resources,
technological innovations, and communication services to capitalists
back on Earth.]{.underline} This places outer space on the same level as
traditional colonization, analyzed in Hegel's Philosophy of Right, which
Hegel thought of as a product of the 'inner dialectic of civil
society\', which drives the market to 'push beyond its own limits and
seek markets, and so its necessary means of subsistence, in other lands
which are either deficient in the goods it has overproduced, or else
generally backward in creative industry, etc.\' (Hegel, 2008, p. 222).
In this regard, SpaceX and related ventures are not so very different
from maritime colonialists and the trader-exploiters of the British East
India Company. But there is something new at stake. [As the Silicon
Valley entrepreneur Peter Diamandis has gleefully noted: 'There are
twenty-trillion-dollar checks up there, waiting to be cashed!\' (Seaney
and Glendenning, 2016). [Capitalistkind consists in the naturalization
of capitalist consciousness and practice]{.mark}, the (false)
universalization of a particular mode of political economy [as inherent
to the human condition]{.mark}, followed by the projection of this
naturalized universality into space---capitalist humanity as a
Fukuyamite 'end of history\', the end-point of (earthly) historical
unfolding, but the starting point of humanity's first serious advances
in space.]{.underline}

What role, then, for the state? The frontiersmen of NewSpace tend to
think of themselves as libertarians, pioneers beyond the domain of state
bureaucracy (see Nelson and Block, 2018). 'The government should leave
the design work and ownership of the product to the private sector\',
the author of a 2017 report, Capitalism in Space, advocates. 'The
private companies know best how to build their own products to maximize
performance while lowering cost\' (Zimmerman, 2017, p. 27). One
ethnographer notes that 'politically, right-libertarianism prevails\'
amongst NewSpace entrepreneurs (Valentine, 2016, p. 1047--1048). Just as
Donald Rumsfeld dismissed the opponents to the Iraq War as 'Old
Europe\', so too are state entities' interests in space exploration
shrugged off as symptoms of 'Old Space\'. Elon Musk, we are told in a
recent biography, unlike the sluggish Big State actors of yore, 'would
apply some of the start-up techniques he'd learned in Silicon Valley to
run SpaceX lean and fast...As a private company, SpaceX would also avoid
the waste and cost overruns associated with government contractors\'
(Vance, 2015, p. 114). This libertarianism-in-space has found a willing
chorus of academic supporters. The legal scholar Virgiliu Pop introduces
the notion of the frontier paradigm (combining laissez-faire economics,
market competition, and an individualist ethic) into the domain of space
law, claiming that this paradigm has 'proven its worth on our planet\'
and will 'most likely...do so in the extraterrestrial realms\' as well
(Pop, 2009, p. vi). This frontier paradigm is not entirely new: a
'Columbus mythology\', centering on the 'noble explorer\', was
continuously evoked in the United States during the Cold War space race
(Dickens and Ormrod, 2016, pp. 79, 162--164).

But the entrepreneurial libertarianism of capitalistkind is undermined
by the reliance of the entire NewSpace complex on extensive support from
the state, 'a public-private financing model underpinning long-shot
start-ups\' that in the case of Musk's three main companies (SpaceX,
SolarCity Corp., and Tesla) has been underpinned by \$4.9 billion
dollars in government subsidies (Hirsch, 2015). In the nascent field of
space tourism, Cohen (2017) argues that what began as an almost entirely
private venture quickly ground to a halt in the face of insurmountable
technical and financial obstacles, only solved by piggybacking on large
state-run projects, such as selling trips to the International Space
Station, against the objections of NASA scientists. The business model
of NewSpace depends on the taxpayer's dollar while making pretensions to
individual self-reliance. The vast majority of present-day clients of
private aerospace corporations are government clients, usually military
in origin. Furthermore, the bulk of rocket launches in the United States
take place on government property, usually operated by the US Air Force
or NASA.Footnote13

This inward tension between state dependency and capitalist autonomy is
itself a product of neoliberalism's contradictory demand for a minimal,
"slim" state, while simultaneously (and in fact) relying on a state
reengineered and retooled for the purposes of capital accumulation
(Wacquant, 2012). As Lazzarato writes, 'To be able to be
"laissez-faire", it is necessary to intervene a great deal\' (2017, p.
7). Space libertarianism is libertarian in name only: behind every
NewSpace venture looms a thick web of government spending programs,
regulatory agencies, public infrastructure, and universities bolstered
by research grants from the state. SpaceX would not exist were it not
for state-sponsored contracts of satellite launches. Similarly, in 2018,
the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)---the famed
origin of the World Wide Web---announced that it would launch a
'responsive launch competition\', meaning essentially the reuse of
launch vehicles, representing an attempt by the state to 'harness
growing commercial capabilities\' and place them in the service of the
state's interest in ensuring 'national security\' (Foust, 2018b).

This libertarianism has been steadily growing in the nexus between
Silicon Valley, Stanford University, Wall Street, and the Washington
political establishment, which tend to place a high value on Randian
'objectivism\' and participate in a long American intellectual heritage
of individualistic 'bootstrapping\' and (allegedly) gritty
self-reliance. But as Nelson and Block (2018, p. 189--197) recognize,
one of the central symbolic operations of capitalistkind resides in
concealing its reliance on the state by mobilizing the charm of its
entrepreneurial constituents and the spectacle of space. There is a case
to be made for the idea that SpaceX and its ilk resemble semi-private
corporations like the British East India Company. The latter,
"incorporated by royal charter from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth I in
1600 to trade in silk and spices, and other profitable Indian
commodities," recruited soldiers and built a 'commercial business
\[that\] quickly became a business of conquest\' (Tharoor, 2017).
SpaceX, too, is increasingly imbricated with an attempt on the part of a
particular state, the United States, to colonize and appropriate
resources derived from a particular area, that of outer space; it, too,
depends on the infrastructure, contracts, and regulatory environment
that thus far only a state seems able to provide. Its private character,
like that of the East India Company, is troubled by being deeply
embedded in the state. As one commentator has observed of SpaceX, 'If
there's a consistent charge against Elon Musk and his high-flying
companies...it's that they're not really examples of independent,
innovative market capitalism. Rather, they're government contractors,
dependent on taxpayer money to stay afloat\' (cit. Nelson and Block,
2018, p. 189).

Perhaps this should not come as a surprise. As Bourdieu (2005, p. 12)
observed, 'The economic field is, more than any other, inhabited by the
state, which contributes at every moment to its existence and
persistence, and also to the structure of the relations of force that
characterize it\'. The state lays out the preconditions for market
exchanges. Under neoliberalism, the state is the preeminent facilitator
of markets. The neoliberal state is not so much a Minimalstaat, night
watchman state, or slim state as it is the prima causa of market society
(see, e.g., Wacquant, 2012). Similarly, in the political theory of
Deleuze and Guattari, any economic development presupposes the political
differentiation caused by the state (Deleuze and Guattari, 2004a, p.
237--238). Even in the global environment of contemporary capitalism,
the market cannot operate without the state becoming integrated with
capitalism itself, as 'it is the modern state that gives capitalism its
models of realization\' (Deleuze and Guattari, 2004b, p. 480). For
capitalism to survive in outer space, the state must create a regulatory
environment, subsidize infrastructure, and hand down contracts -- in
short, assemble outer space as a domain made accessible in legal,
technical, and economic ways.

Universalizing capital

[As Earth's empty spaces are filled, as our planet comes to be shorn of
blank places, capitalistkind emerges to rescue capitalism from its
terrestrial limitations, launching space rockets, placing satellites
into orbit, appropriating extraterrestrial resources, and, perhaps one
day, building colonies on distant planets like Mars.]{.underline} But
why limit ourselves to Mars? As of mid-2017, NASA's Kepler observatory
had discovered more than 5000 exoplanets---planets that seem like
promising alternatives to Earth, located at an appropriate distance from
their respective suns in the famed 'Goldilocks zone\'. These 'planetary
candidates\', as they are known---that is, candidates for the
replacement of Earth, capable of supporting human life with only minimal
technological augmentation or cybernetic re-engineering---are above all
viable candidates for selection by specific capitalists seeking to
discover new profitable ventures beyond the limits of an Earth-bound
capitalism. Space reveals the impotence of the neoliberal, post-Fordist
state, its incapacity and unwillingness to embark on gigantic
infrastructural projects, to project itself outwards, and to fire the
imagination of (actual) humankind. Capitalistkind steps in to fill the
vacuum left behind by a state that lacks what Mann (2012, p. 170) calls
'infrastructural power\'. The old question, the question of Old Space,
was quite simply: is this planet a viable site for humankind, a suitable
homeland for the reproduction of human life away from Earth? But the new
question, the question for NewSpace, will be: can this celestial body
support capitalistkind? Will it support the interests of capitalist
entrepreneurs, answering to the capitalist desire for continued
accumulation?

While some elements of the astrosociological community, such as the
Astrosociology Research Institute (ARI),Footnote14 insist on elucidating
the "human dimension" in outer space, Dickens and Ormrod recognize that
this humanization-through-capitalism really involves the
'commodification of the universe\' (2007b, p. 2). While Dickens and
Ormrod develop similar arguments to those sketched here---from their
concept of an 'outer spatial fix\' to their argument about outer space
becoming woven into circuits of capital accumulation---they were writing
at a time when their remarks necessarily remained speculative: the
commercialization of space was still in its infancy. In an inversion of
Hegel's owl of Minerva, reality has since largely confirmed their ideas
and caught up with theory. Above all, when considering the various
ventures ongoing in space today, it is not so much the universalizing
human dimension as the specifically capitalist dimension that is
striking. With the advent of NewSpace, outer space is becoming not the
domain of a common humanity but of private capital.

[The arguments laid out above [mirror an ongoing turn]{.mark} in
critical scholarship [away from the]{.mark} notion of the [Anthropocene
towards]{.mark} a more rigorously political-economic concept of
[Capitalocene]{.mark}, premised on the 'claim that capitalism is the
pivot of today's biospheric crisis\' (Moore, 2016, p. xi). Just as the
exponents of the concept of Capitalocene emphasize that it is
capitalism, and not humanity as such, that is the driving force behind
environmental transformation, so too does the notion of capitalistkind
emphasize that it is not humankind tout court but rather a set of
specific capitalist entrepreneurs who are acting as the central
transformative agents of and in outer space, with the 'ever-increasing
infiltration of capital\' into what was formerly the domain of the state
(Dickens and Ormrod, 2007a, p. 6).]{.underline} We can also think about
these issues in terms of what Philippopoulos-Mihalopoulos (2015) terms
'spatial justice\'. This concept captures the fact that struggles over
justice are often struggles to occupy space, as the term is more
conventionally understood, as with urban battles over the 'right to the
city\' (Harvey, 2008), to provide just one example. But the same also
holds true for outer space: there is an ongoing struggle over the right
to take up space in outer space. So far, the capitalist side appears to
be winning. [[As the proto-communism of the Cold War-era Outer Space
Treaty is abandoned]{.mark}---in tandem with the increased technological
feasibility of exploiting resources and accumulating profits in outer
space---[spatial justice in outer space increasingly comes to mean the
'justice\' of capital, capitalistkind taking the place of
humankind]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is comparatively easy to declare that
outer space is a commons, as the Outer Space Treaty did in the late
1960s, when that domain is, for all practical purposes, inaccessible to
capital; with the heightened accessibility of outer space, however, it
is unsurprising that central political agents, such as President Trump's
administration, should seek to dismantle this regulatory framework and
ensure the smooth functioning of capital accumulation beyond the
terrains of Earth.

[What kind of [capitalism is being projected into space]{.mark}? The
complexity of state-market relations is sufficient to force us to hedge
against a simplified reading of space commercialization: it is not a
matter of states against markets, as if the two were mutually
exclusive.]{.underline} Instead, as Bratton (2015) suggests, we are
witnessing the emergence of a 'stack\', a complex intertwining of
commercial, geopolitical, and technological concerns, which challenges
previous notions of state sovereignty. This can be seen as a hybridized
state-market form, with technology playing a central role in reciprocal
processes of political and economic transformation. On the one hand,
outer space was in some sense always already the domain of
marketization, albeit to a limited extent, even during the Cold War,
from the first commercial satellite launch in the early 1960s to
President Ronald Reagan's implementation of the Commercial Space Launch
Act of 1984, which aimed to encourage private enterprise to take an
interest in an emerging launch market. As Hermann Bondi, the head of the
European Space Organization, wrote in the early 1970s, 'It is
clear...that there must be three partners in space, universities and
research institutions on the one hand, the government on the second and
industry on the third\' (Bondi, 1971, p. 9).

On the other hand, outer space still remains firmly within the domain of
the state and is likely to do so for the foreseeable future, with the
likely continued importance of military uses of satellite technology and
the weaponization of Earth's orbit---crucially, the Outer Space Treaty
only prohibits nuclear arms and other 'weapons of mass destruction\' in
space, not conventional weapons, such as ballistic missiles. One novel
element in this phase of capitalism-in-space is the interrelationship
between Silicon Valley, NewSpace, and the state (see, e.g., Vance,
2015). Silicon Valley's capitalist class, including Amazon's Jeff Bezos,
play an outsize role in NewSpace. Behind and around these figures,
however, remains the state---through its weighty fiscal, regulatory,
military, and symbolic investments.Footnote15 To take but one example:
In June 2018, SpaceX won a \$130 million contract with the U.S. Air
Force to launch an 'Air Force Space Command\' satellite onboard a Falcon
Heavy rocket (Erwin, 2018).

Fredric Jameson's (2003, p. 76) oft-quoted observation that it is easier
to imagine the end of humankind than the end of capitalism, is realized
in the ideals and operations of capitalistkind. Elon Musk has observed
that the goal of SpaceX is to establish humankind as a 'multiplanetary
species with a self-sustaining civilization on another planet\' whose
purpose is to counteract the possibility of a 'worst-case scenario
happening and extinguishing human consciousness\' (Vance, 2015, p. 5).
But couldn't we view this idealistic assertion on behalf of humanity in
another way? It is not human consciousness, over and against what the
writer Kim Stanley Robinson (2017, p. 2) calls 'mineral
unconsciousness\' (i.e., the mute, geological reality of the natural
universe), so much as a specifically capitalist consciousness that is at
stake. While the actions of capitalistkind may primarily be aimed at
ensuring the future survival of the human species, an additional result
is to ensure that the very idea of capitalism itself will outlive a
(distantly) possible extinction event. Capitalism is a self-replicating
system, pushing to expand ever outwards, using a territorializing
strategy of survival. As David Harvey notes, 'a steady rate of growth is
essential for the health of a capitalist economic system, since it is
only through growth that profits can be assured and the accumulation of
capital be sustained\' (1990, p. 180). In this respect, outer space is
ideal: it is boundless and infinite. As Earth comes to be blanketed by
capital, it is only to be expected that capital should set its sights on
the stars above. [[The actions of capitalistkind serve to bolster the
capitalist mode of production and accumulation]{.mark}: it is not only
life but capital itself that must outlive Earth---even into the darkness
of space.]{.underline}

[In the aftermath of the so-called linguistic turn in the social
sciences, an increasing number of scholars in International Relations
studied how [environmental problems have been discursively framed as
security problem]{.mark}s. Starting from the assumption that security
threats are not simply objectively given, they showed how different
[authorized actors]{.mark} -- including politicians, scientists, and
military officials -- have successfully [reframed environment
problems]{.mark} like climate change as security concerns (Buzan et al.,
1998; Floyd, 2010). The merit of these works has been to demonstrate
that 'framing matters' (Dalby and O'Lear, 2016: 5): that the way in
which environmental problems are perceived and treated politically
depends on how they are framed discursively.]{.underline} They revealed
that different discourses of environmental security identify different
threats (e.g. climate-induced migration, scarcity-induced conflicts, or
natural disasters), multiple referent objects to be protected (e.g. the
environment vs. the nation-state vs. vulnerable populations), and
heterogeneous policy responses to organize this protection (Detraz and
Betsill, 2009; McDonald, 2013; Trombetta, 2008).

[Notwithstanding these merits, the literature on the securitization of
the environment has been criticized for its narrow focus on securitizing
speech acts and linguistic threat constructions and for drawing a stark
boundary between the physical reality (which is not directly
perceivable) and the socially constructed world (the meaningful
representation of reality).]{.underline} By concentrating on 'threat
perceptions rather than an actual danger emanating from objective
factors' (Mayer, 2012: 167), linguistic constructivist approaches might
thus unwillingly play into the hands of climate skeptics. Furthermore,
the one-dimensional relation between discourses and practices implied by
linguistic constructivist works has been criticized (Rothe, 2016).
Asking how certain speech acts unidirectionally shape policy responses
to environmental threats, they would fail to acknowledge the mutually
constitutive relationship between discourses and practices.

[A broader understanding of environmental security is provided by
governmentality approaches (Oels, 2013; Rothe, 2016). In this
perspective, environmental security is understood not so much as a
discourse but as a particular field of government shaped by competing
political rationalities, subjectivities, practices, and technologies.
Some of these works, for example, have shown how [environmental problems
such as climate change have been turned into security problems through a
range of expert practices]{.mark} including risk assessment, scenario
development, and hotspot modeling]{.underline} (Mayer, 2012; Methmann
and Rothe, 2014). Others have shown that practices of environmental
security cohere with different ideal-typical governmentalities such as
liberalism, biopolitics, or neoliberalism, each of which produces a
different set of assumptions on the subjects, objects, and means of
government (see Oels, 2013). Governmentality studies, however, have been
criticized for their tendency to simply assign practices and discourses
of environmental security to ideal-typical governmentalities (Corry,
2014). This would risk overstating the coherence of existing
governmentalities and treating practices and political technologies as
epiphenomenal to the broader political discourses that shape them.

[A further important extension of discourse-analytical works on
environmental security has been provided by works that focus on [the
role of visuality in the construction of security threats and
risks]{.mark}. As nicely expressed by Bleiker (2015: 874): 'Images ...
frame what can be seen, thought and said. In doing so, they delineate
what is and is not politically possible.' [Two features]{.mark} are said
to [distinguish pictures]{.mark} and other visuals [from words in the
construction of security. First,]{.mark} pictures and **[satellite
images]{.mark}** are taken as authoritative sources of knowledge, as
they [apparently represent reality in an objective manner]{.mark} (Dodge
and Perkins, 2009: 498; Shim, 2014: 156). [The authority of visuals is
particularly evident in the realm of environmental security.
Here]{.mark}, a whole range of [visualization techniques -- from]{.mark}
colorful data visualizations to computer models or [satellite images --
make abstract and complex phenomena]{.mark} such as climate-induced
migration (Methmann and Rothe, 2014) or the geopolitics of climate
change (Manzo, 2012) [visible and sizable. Second, images are]{.mark}
particularly [suitable for invoking]{.mark} certain emotive
[reactions]{.mark}, such as fear, horror, or grief, that are crucial for
the creation of urgency and danger in security discourses. Again, this
is [mirrored in the debate on environmental security, where powerful
icons]{.mark} -- such as images of polar bears on retreating ice sheets
-- or colors in data visualizations [are used to invoke emotive
reactions]{.mark} and a sense of risk (see Liverman, 2009; Schneider and
Nocke, 2014).]{.underline}

[The [emerging]{.mark} body of [literature]{.mark} on visual security
represents a promising way to broaden the analytical scope of
environmental security beyond the narrow realm of language and speech
acts. However, I hold that it often [follows a too narrow understanding
of visuality]{.mark} -- as simply a particular form of discursive
representation -- [that ignores the complex materiality]{.mark} of the
visual. This materiality is to be found in the visual economies in which
images are produced, circulated, and interpreted (Dodge and Perkins,
2009; Parks, 2009). Furthermore, [images and pictures are not only
semiotic]{.mark} systems of signs [but also physical objects]{.mark}
that can be printed, circulated, blocked, (re-)combined, and reproduced.
Finally, looking at, seeing, touching, or interpreting visuals are
material bodily practices -- [which are increasingly supplemented with
technological practices]{.mark} such as algorithmic pattern detection or
automated image analyses (see Brannon, 2013).]{.underline}

Environmental security as ontological politics

To account for the materiality of the visual and for the special role of
visual technologies in the construction of environmental security, I
reread the existing literature on environmental security through the
lens of ANT and the notion of ontological politics. In short, ANT
radicalizes the assumptions of linguistic or visual constructivism.
Instead of viewing texts, images, and other semiotic systems as
representations of a pre-existing single reality, it holds that the
interplay of expert practices, scientific discourses, technologies, and
visuals constitutes multiple realities (Hind and Lammes, 2016: 81--82).
Annemarie Mol (2002), for example, shows through her long-term
ethnographic research in Dutch hospitals how different medical practices
and diagnostic tools produce multiple versions of atherosclerosis. To
assume that phenomena are multiple implies they are 'more than one but
less than many' (Mol, 2002: 55). According to this understanding,
ontology 'is not given in the order of things but ... ontologies are
brought into being, sustained, or allowed to wither away in common,
day-to-day, sociomaterial practices' (Mol, 2002: 6). As Ingunn Moser
(2008: 99) puts it, natural realities become 'matter-real' and are
'mattering' only through their 'continued enactment and re-enactment in
situated practices'. Following these assumptions, environmental security
can be understood as a form of ontological politics, in which the
ontological status of phenomena such as climate change, deforestation,
or natural disasters -- as well as the ways of knowing them -- becomes
the subject of debate (Barry, 2013: 7; Schouten, 2014).

[I argue that [**visual technologies such as satellite remote sensing**
play a crucial role in the ontological politics of environmental
security]{.mark}. Consider Mol's seminal work in the ontological
politics of disease. A large share of the practices that render a
disease such as atherosclerosis 'matter-real' are based on visual
technologies: X-ray units, MRI scanners, microscopes, molecular imaging
techniques, etc. The same holds true for the realm of environmental
security. Here, [visual technologies, including]{.mark} computer
modeling, [satellite remote sensing]{.mark}, data visualization, hotspot
mapping, and graphs of future scenarios, [enact different versions of
'the environment' as security]{.mark} risk (Randalls, 2014). [Rather
than producing]{.mark} mere [representations of]{.mark} pre-existing
[environmental risks, visual technologies]{.mark} essentially [bring
them abou]{.mark}t: 'The world does not exist before these ways of
sensing' (Hind and Lammes, 2016: 90). For, as Mitchell (2013: 233)
crucially reminds us, 'Nature is unable to speak for itself.... The
facts of nature speak only with the help of measuring devices and tools
of calculation'. [To render a phenomenon such as climate change
visible]{.mark}, intelligible, and thereby 'matter-ing' and
'matter-real', [a global assemblage of visual technologies -- including
satellites]{.mark}, weather stations, computer simulations, researchers,
and mechanisms of international cooperation -- [is required]{.mark}
(Edwards, 2010; Wark, 2015: 166--182).]{.underline}

[To study visual technologies as part of the ontological politics of
environmental security, I first draw on the notion of immutable mobiles
(Latour, 1986). Bruno Latour has coined this term to explain the power
effects of 'technologies of visualisation and inscription' (Latour,
2013: 77), such as the printing press, cartography, photography, or the
computer, that allow inscribing parts of the real world into flat and
mobile artifacts (Latour, 1986: 17). [Through]{.mark} these
[technologies, reality becomes flattened, mobile but immutable.
Inscribed into pictures]{.mark}, maps, or charts, inscriptions of local
realities -- such as a piece of soil -- can be circulated globally,
reproduced, or combined with other inscriptions of reality. Pictures of
different origin and different scale can be layered (Latour, 1986:
7).]{.underline}

[Second, I draw upon the notion of visual assemblage (Bleiker, 2014: 76)
to account for the fact that environmental risks and threats are never
produced by a single technology -- never become visible on a single
image -- but become enacted by a complex web of linked inscription
devices, practices, and discourses (Latour and Hermant, 2006:
29).]{.underline} The notion of assemblage refers to a temporary form of
order of heterogeneous elements 'whose unity comes solely from the fact
that these items function together, that they "work" together as a
functional entity' (Patton, 1994: 158). [The [visual assemblage of
environmental security can be understood as]{.mark} exactly such [a
heterogeneous network of visual technologies and related
infrastructures]{.mark}, people, laws and regulations, discourses, and
practices (van Munster and Sylvest, 2016: 2). [The immutable mobiles
(satellite pictures,]{.mark} global climate models, vulnerability maps),
[which circulate through this assemblage, create new associative
relations between]{.mark} actors as diverse as [satellite operators,
climate scientists, environmental activists, or military
officials]{.mark} (Mayer, 2012). Together they [turn 'nature' into a
range of calculable, perceivable, and governable risks]{.mark} through a
series of calculations, transformations, and translations (Hind and
Lammes, 2016). The notion of visual assemblage makes it possible to
account both for the socio-material character of the visual and for the
messiness and multiplicity of practices and discourses of environmental
security.]{.underline}

Using the framework in practice

The perspective of assemblage calls for a pluralization of methods in
the study of visual politics (Bleiker, 2014). To grasp the
social/technical/discursive/visual character of visual assemblages, I
combine three analytical layers. The first analytical layer is a
semiotic visual analysis (Rose, 2016: 106--146). A corpus of highly
visible demonstration images -- provided on websites, in demonstration
reports, in social networks, or in demonstration videos -- has been
compiled in each case. Such showcase images are particularly promising
for the objectives of this article because they are pre-selected by the
respective actors to demonstrate the whole range of possible
applications and capabilities of satellite imagery. A set of heuristic
questions helps to structure the analysis: What do the images show and
what is hidden? Are there common visual characteristics or patterns? How
are images arranged and how are colors used? And what are the aesthetic
and political effects of decisions on the composition, color, framing,
or resolution of images?1 Second, a discourse-analytical layer reveals
the interdiscursive context of images through a study of the reports,
homepages, flyers, or policy documents in which they are embedded (Rose,
2016: 186--219). Here, I ask how the different texts ascribe meaning to
the images, and how the latter become linked to broader concepts,
narratives, and storylines in environmental security discourse. A third
layer focuses on the performativity of images as immutable mobiles and
their function in broader visual assemblages. So, here the question is
what visuals do rather than what they show: How are images produced by
broader visual assemblages? How are they circulated or blocked? And how
do they enact different versions of the environment? To study this third
layer, I draw on a comprehensive review of the relevant secondary
literature, combined with a thorough document analysis of legislation,
regulations, and related policy documents in each case.

The co-evolution of remote sensing and environmental security

[[The roots of the visual assemblage of environmental security]{.mark}
can be **[trace]{.mark}**d [back to the militarization of geophysical
research]{.mark} in the early years of the Cold War (Dalby, 2013: 41).
With its successful launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 during the
so-called International Geophysical Year, the Soviet Union fired the
starting pistol for a technological and scientific race between the two
superpowers. As a crucial part of this race, [satellite remote sensing
emerged as a dual-use technolog]{.mark}y, or 'cyborg science -- the
result of an irreparable fusion of scientific and military concepts,
materials and skills' (Elam, 1999: 106). At the same time, the strategic
communities' interest in the atmospheric impact of nuclear weapons
boosted advancements in numerical weather modeling, which in the 1960s
were further developed into the first simulation models of global
climate change. The [ever more detailed global models at the same time
produced 'an insatiable thirst for data from every corner of the
world']{.mark} (Edwards, 2010: 24), which since the late 1970s and 1980s
was increasingly satisfied by satellite-based remote sensors. In
addition, in 1972 the US administration established the Landsat program
within the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as
the first civilian satellite remote sensing program. The program's eight
satellites provided multispectral Earth imagery at moderate spatial
resolution -- perfectly suited for land (change) monitoring -- and
thereby contributed considerably to the discovery of macro-scale
environmental problems, including deforestation, land degradation, and
the ozone hole (DeLoughrey, 2014: 261).]{.underline}

[[NASA's Landsat and other]{.mark} emerging remote sensing [programs can
be considered]{.mark} as [parts of an emerging visual assemblage of
heterogeneous]{.mark} human and non-human [components]{.mark} (Barry,
2013: 14; Edwards, 2010). This assemblage includes hardware such as
satellites, sensors, ground stations, and data centers;
imagery-processing-and-analysis software; data such as images or digital
maps; human actors like system operators, policymakers, scientists, and
national security personnel; and legal and regulatory frameworks
(Thompson, 2007: 2). [The capacity to 'see' environmental
problems]{.mark}, and to see the planet from a distance, [is distributed
across this visual assemblage]{.mark}. Neither the satellites, which
translate the electromagnetic radiation reflected from the Earth's
surfaces into numerical grey-values, nor the operators in the control
room, which process 'wavelengths in false colours' (Latour and Hermant,
2006: 8), nor the software tools that turn the data into realistic
true-color images, nor the analysts or algorithms that interpret the
resulting images would be able see anything were it not for the other
elements in the assemblage.]{.underline}

A securitization precursor

[I would argue that [there was a close co-evolution between the
emergence of a global visual assemblage of satellite remote sensing and
the emerging discourse on environmental security]{.mark} in the 1980s
and 1990s. The notion of co-evolution stresses the reciprocity of this
development. While the satellite gaze made it possible to conceive of
environmental change as a global threat in the first place (Van Munster
and Sylvest, 2016: 6), [environmental security]{.mark} also [became
inscribed into technical decisions]{.mark}, for example when Landsat's
remote sensors were optimized to monitor land change and resource
degradation. The mutual imbrication of satellite technology and
environmental security played out at several levels. First, the
militarization of geophysical research during the Cold War created new
associations between geoscientists and security actors that were crucial
for the emerging imaginary of the environment as a security problem.
Marzec (2014: 244) describes how this emerging actor-network led, for
example, to the US defense and intelligence community's interest in
climate change in the early 1990s:]{.underline}

In 1992 the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) began to establish
relations with climate scientists in the program Measurements of Earth
Data for Environmental Analysis, or MEDEA, when it declassified
satellite imagery for 'patriotic' climate scientists.

[Second, [the]{.mark} described [visual assemblage enabled a new 'way of
seeing' the Earth]{.mark} and the human environment, [which might be
called a planetary gaze]{.mark} (DeLoughrey, 2014; Jasanoff, 2004: 44).
The new possibility to look at the planet from the outside produced a
sense both of the earth's singularity and of its radical fragility. The
planetary gaze [produced a]{.mark} certain uncanniness -- a [feeling of
being detached from planet Earth]{.mark} (DeLoughrey, 2014: 264). In so
doing, the planetary gaze invoked deep-rooted 'apocalyptic fears about
the end of the earth' (DeLoughrey, 2014: 266). This sense of urgency
created by satellite remote sensing resonated well with the early
environmental security debate in the 1990s and its alarmist tone
(Marzec, 2014: 235). Yet the planetary gaze of the described visual
assemblage did not simply produce another discursive frame of a
pre-existing environment. Rather, it [constituted a whole new reality of
the Earth as a singular]{.mark}, interconnected, and [fragile
system]{.mark} (Van Munster and Sylvest, 2016: 4--8). This fragile Earth
system became 'matter-real' through the immutable mobiles -- such as
true-color satellite images, simulation models, graphs, or numerical
calculations -- produced by two central inscription technologies:
satellite remote sensing and computer modeling (Edwards, 2010: 2). By
developing these technologies into a comprehensive global monitoring
system, it was believed it would be possible to monitor, predict,
control, and manage the Earth system (Jasanoff, 2004: 42; Marzec, 2014:
245). This global monitoring approach, which highlighted the role of
national leaders as planetary or environmental managers, considerably
influenced the early environmental security debate.]{.underline}

[Third, [the focus of the early environmental security debate]{.mark} in
the 1990s [was on]{.mark} large-scale global problems such as
scarcity-induced conflict or migration (Rothe, 2016). The detection of
these large-scale problems was closely linked to the technical
capabilities of satellite remote sensing, for to detect large-scale,
slow-onset changes like land degradation and resulting scarcities, an
abstracted, distant view from above was required. What is more,
multispectral sensors, such as those carried by Landsat satellites, made
it possible to visualize processes of plant degradation in the infrared
range of radiation. To be precise, these [large-scale environmental
changes]{.mark} were [considered as drivers of conflict]{.mark} and
migration in the early environmental security discourse. [Remote sensors
and their planetary gaze]{.mark} thus [considerably influenced the
epistemological horizon of environmental security
thinking.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Opening and commercializing remote sensing

During the Cold War, access to the visual assemblage of satellite remote
sensing was restricted to a closed 'club' of a few geoscientists,
military research centers, and international bureaucrats (Elam, 1999:
98). The monopolization of space technology and security concerns
imposed heavy restrictions on the circulation of the immutable mobiles
of satellite sensors. Landsat is a good case in point: while the civil
Landsat program was used by the USA to promote ideals of transparency
and international scientific cooperation, the US government at the same
time restricted the permitted spatial and spectral resolutions of
Landsat images (Thompson, 2007: 8). Furthermore, the inaccessibility of
satellite images and their abstract, scientific enactment of the
environment further limited the number of potential users.

Shortly before the end of the Cold War, however, this picture began to
change. The USA reacted to privatization efforts in France and the
Soviet Union and decided to open and commercialize its remote sensing
industry with the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 (Elam, 1999:
99). The commercialization process was accompanied by the triumphal
march of the personal computer and the spread of geographic information
system (GIS) software to read, process, and interpret geodata, which
further increased the number of users of commercial satellite imagery.
As a result, satellite remote sensing grew into a massive and complex
global market with a projected size of US\$2.6 billion by 2020. The
current global market is characterized by the dominance of a few global
players, such as DigitalGlobe, and national space agencies as well as
the emergence of myriad medium- and small-sized enterprises that are
turning satellite data into maps, GIS products, or data visualizations.

[[The opening and commercialization of remote sensing technology
happened at the same time as a shift in environmental security discourse
towards human security]{.mark} and resilience (Corry, 2014; Detraz and
Betsill, 2009; Trombetta, 2008). Increasingly, the focus of
environmental security was [shifted from the international
system]{.mark} or the nation-state [towards individuals' and local
communities' vulnerabilities and local environmental risks]{.mark}
(McDonald, 2013: 46--47). A global managerial command-and-control
approach to environmental problems made way for more regionalized
approaches of risk management and other measures to enhance the adaptive
capacities of vulnerable populations against environmental shocks (Oels,
2013: 24--26).]{.underline}
