Fourth, traditional military alliances exercise influence in a variety
of ways. Allied countries are better equipped to meet one another's
modernization needs, more likely to face common threats, and more likely
to share foreign-policy goals. Thus, [[alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}
should generally [[increase demand for DCAs]{.mark}.]{.underline}
However, I anticipate [a [unique]{.mark} influence [for NATO]{.mark}
because its]{.underline} unusually [broad mandate spills into issue
areas]{.underline}---training, defense research, joint exercises,
etc.---[also addressed by DCAs]{.underline}. Accordingly, [demand for
DCAs should be lower between NATO states]{.underline}. At the same time,
because **[[DCAs are]{.mark} an [important]{.mark} mechanism [for
prospective NATO members to signal alignment]{.mark}]{.underline}**, I
anticipate a positive effect for pairings between NATO members and
Partnership-for-Peace (PfP) states.

[[Coordination problems are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[apparent in
DCAs. Variations in]{.underline}]{.mark} the institutional
[[characteristics]{.underline}]{.mark} of DCAs partially [[reflect
distributional concerns]{.mark}. Governments worry about]{.underline}
[asymmetric gains]{.underline}---that is, the possibility that one's
partners will gain more than oneself.47 Further, [negotiators know that
revealing a preference for]{.underline} particular design [features may
lead others to increase their demands]{.underline} accordingly. Given
these incentives, [governments anticipate that their interlocutors may
not be fully transparent]{.underline} about their treaty preferences.
**[That [uncertainty]{.mark},]{.underline}** in turn, **[[increases the
risk of bargaining failure]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Given their broad
flexibility as framework agreements, [[DCAs]{.mark} particularly [raise
concerns about **scope, precision, and**]{.mark} **the [degree of
reliance]{.mark}** on implementing arrangements]{.underline}.

A contentious 2007 negotiation between [[Singapore and Indonesia]{.mark}
offers an illuminating example.]{.underline} In response to Singapore's
request for access to Indonesian waters for training purposes, [the
resulting [DCA included a seemingly]{.mark} [benign]{.mark} implementing
[arrangement]{.mark}]{.underline} that designated an "Area Bravo"
southwest of Indonesia's Natuna Islands.48 Almost
[immediately]{.underline} upon signature of the DCA, [[Indonesian
politicians accused Singapore of disingenuousness]{.mark} and began
speculating on the "broad latitude" that the Singapore military would
wield]{.underline} in Area Bravo, involving naval exercises, air
support, live fire, and even participation of third parties---[all of
which]{.underline}, given Singapore's growing military strength,
[would]{.underline} likely [intensify over time]{.underline}.49
[Indonesia's defense minister, seizing on ambiguities]{.underline}
within the agreement, [declared that "Singapore still wants rules of
their own, without having to negotiate]{.underline} \... on their
military training here."50 He further asserted, "We want clear rules of
the game on the frequency and scope of Singapore military training,
including how many times Singapore can fire its missiles in our
territory."51 While Singapore's true preferences remain opaque, **[[the
mere perception of duplicity]{.mark} by the Indonesian government [was
sufficient to doom the proceedings]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

####  2 -- mistrust and obligational concerns

[[DCAs show]{.mark} strong [evidence of **collaboration problems**. When
governments coordinate their defense policies]{.mark}, pool]{.underline}
defense-related research-and-development ([R&D) resources,
transfer]{.underline} sophisticated [weapons and military technologies,
exchange classified information, hold joint exercises, and]{.underline}
so on, they [engage in]{.underline} inherently [risky activities [that
**create opportunities for exploitation.** The key danger in]{.mark}
signing [a DCA]{.mark}]{.underline} with an untrusted partner [[is that
**the partner might**]{.mark}]{.underline} ultimately **[[employ]{.mark}
the [gains]{.mark} of cooperation [for its own]{.mark} strategic
[advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the event of direct confrontation,
the [improvements in military capacity]{.underline} that DCAs
enable---better training, access to classified material, first-hand
knowledge of others' tactics and operating procedures---[can be readily
used to exploit a nominal defense partner. [These concerns further
extend to]{.mark}]{.underline} relations with [[third
parties]{.underline}]{.mark}, both governmental and nongovernmental. For
example, [the US has long worried that military cooperation with
countries like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan indirectly supports extremist
organizations.]{.underline} More benignly, [[DCA]{.mark}
partnership[s]{.mark} also [involve **managerial concerns** about the
ability of partners to fulfill their obligations]{.mark}]{.underline}.40
In 2007, for example, the Japanese self- defense force unintentionally
leaked classified details of the US-built Aegis weapons system, causing
a furor in the US defense community.41 For all these reasons[, DCAs
require credible assurances of trustworthiness.]{.underline}

### 2AC \-\-- Unilat Fails

#### US unilat foreign policy [fails]{.underline} -- makes us [unable]{.underline} to tackle [common challenges]{.underline} or succeed [domestically]{.underline}

Whatever the failings of this new paradigm[, there is no going
back;]{.underline} history does not offer do-overs. [Nor should
Washington return to a foreign policy that]{.underline}, for much of
three decades, largely [failed]{.underline} both in what it did and in
what it did not do.

[[The starting point for]{.mark} a new [internationalism should
be]{.mark} a clear [recognition that although foreign policy begins at
home, it cannot end there. The U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, regardless of its diminished influence
and deep domestic divisions, [[faces]{.mark} a world with]{.underline}
both traditional [[geopolitical threats]{.mark} and]{.underline} new
[challenges [tied to globalization]{.mark}]{.underline}. An American
[president must]{.underline} seek to [fix what ails the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [without neglecting what
happens abroad. Greater [disarray in the world will
make]{.mark}]{.underline} the task to "build back better"---or whatever
slogan is chosen for [[domestic renewal]{.underline}]{.mark}---much more
difficult, if not [[impossible]{.mark}. Biden]{.underline} has
[acknowledged]{.underline} the "fundamental truth of the 21st century .
. . that **[[our]{.mark} own [success is bound]{.mark} up [with
others]{.mark} succeeding as wel]{.underline}**l"; [the question is
whether he can craft and carry out a foreign policy that reflects
it.]{.underline}

**[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited [**[S]{.underline}**t]{.mark}ates
also **[[cannot succeed alone. It must work with
others]{.underline}]{.mark}**, through both formal and informal means,
**[[to set international norms]{.mark} and standards [and marshal
collective action]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [Such an approach will
require]{.underline}]{.mark} [the involvement of traditional [allies in
Europe]{.mark} and Asia, new partners, countries that]{.underline} may
[need]{.underline} U.S. or international [help at home, and
nondemocracies[. It will require]{.mark} the use of]{.underline} all the
instruments of power available to the United
States---[[diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}, but also [trade, aid,
**[intelligence, and the military]{.mark}**. Nor can the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [risk letting unpredictability
give it a reputation as unreliable; other states will determine their
own actions]{.underline}, especially when it comes to balancing or
accommodating China, [based]{.underline} in no small part [on how
dependable]{.underline} and active [they believe the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will be]{.underline} as a partner.

**[[In the absence of]{.underline}]{.mark}** a new **[[American
internationalism, the]{.underline}]{.mark}** likely [**[outcome will be
a world]{.mark} that is [less free, more violent, and less
willing]{.mark}**]{.underline} or able [**[to tackle common
challenges]{.mark}**. It is]{.underline} equal parts [ironic and
dangerous that at a time when the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is more affected by global developments than
ever]{.underline} before, [it is less willing to carry out a foreign
policy that attempts to shape them]{.underline}.

The Strategic Concept is also clear with regard to the referent object
of security. In the broadest sense, NATO refers to the security of the
'alliance' constituted of North America and Europe (NATO 1991, Article
16). However, [throughout]{.underline} **[the whole Strategic Concept
NATO makes clear that its security conception refers to the member
states of the alliance]{.underline}**. In particular [NATO refers "to
security amongst the members of the alliance]{.underline}, regardless of
differences in their circumstances or in their national military
capabilities relative to each other" 46. NATO refers to 'collective
security' as a broad framework that is constituted of member states. In
terms of both agency and referent object the security conception of NATO
remains both statist and state-centric. With regard to the policy to
