As the argument has progressed, a de facto [[alliance
between]{.underline}]{.mark} ostensibly [[progressive identitarians and
Wall Street]{.underline}]{.mark} Democrats [[has come together around
asserting]{.underline}]{.mark}, along with Paul Krugman and others,3
that "[[horizontal inequality]{.underline}]{.mark}"---i.e., inequality
between statistically defined racial/ethnic groups---is a more important
problem than "vertical inequality," characterized as inequality between
individuals and households. That distinction instructively makes class
and class inequality disappear, which is consistent with the trajectory
of American liberalism across the more than seven decades since the end
of World War II. Moreover, [[in a sort of mission creep, opponents of
what they decry as a "class-first"]{.mark}]{.underline} position
increasingly [[have come to denounce any expressions of concern for
economic inequality]{.underline}]{.mark} as in effect catering to white
supremacy. This tendency, which Touré Reed has argued rests on a
race-reductionism,4 has surfaced and spread within the newly revitalized
Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), as even many among those who
consider themselves socialists object to the organization's selection of
Medicare for All as its key political campaign on the ground that
pursuit of decommodified health care for all is objectionable because
doing so does not sufficiently center antiracist and anti-disparitarian
agendas. I submit that there's clearly a problem when anti-socialism is
defined as socialism. The race-reductionist argument is propelled by a
combination of intense moral fervor and crude self-interest. I've argued
in 2018 articles in nonsite, The Baffler, and Dialectical Anthropology,
that, as it has evolved, the post-2016 debate has thrown into bold
relief the class character of antiracist and other expressions of
identity politics.5 That could be a salutary product of the controversy.
It's good in this sort of debate for the mist of ideology to burn off
and the material stakes involved to be clear and in the open. However,
many people who have followed or even participated in the debates have
not connected the dots to see that obvious point or to acknowledge its
implications. One reason for failure to do so is summed up pithily in
Upton Sinclair's quip, "[[It is difficult]{.underline}]{.mark} to get a
man [[to understand something when]{.underline}]{.mark} his [[salary
depends upon]{.underline}]{.mark} his [[not]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[understanding]{.underline}]{.mark} it." Not only would pursuit of an
agenda focused on addressing "horizontal inequality," if successful,
disproportionately benefit upper-status, already well-off people---as
Walter Benn Michaels and I have noted tirelessly over the past decade at
least, the [[reality of a standard of justice based on eliminating group
disparities is that a society could be just]{.underline}]{.mark} [[if 1%
of the population controlled 90% of the resources so long as the one
percent featured]{.underline}]{.mark} blacks, Hispanics, women, lesbians
and gays, etc. in rough [[proportion to]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[[representation]{.underline}]{.mark} in the general population; also,
advocacy of defining the only meaningful inequality as disparities
between groups is itself a career trajectory in the academy, as well as
in the corporate, nonprofit and freelance commentary worlds. There's no
point trying to communicate with those whose resistance stems from such
material investment; no matter what their specific content, their
responses to class critique always amount to the orderly Turkle's lament
to McMurphy in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest---"This is my fucking
job!" Purblindness to identitarianism's ever more clearly exposed class
character also rests on naively habituated ideological thinking. [[Most
of us operate with]{.underline}]{.mark} more or less
[[vague]{.underline}]{.mark} or inchoate [[recognition that the past
included bad]{.underline}]{.mark} old-timey [[times marked by openly
racist practices like slavery]{.underline}]{.mark} and compulsory racial
[[segregation, genocide against Native]{.underline}]{.mark}
American[[s,]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Chinese Exclusion, imposed gender
hierarchies]{.underline}]{.mark}, etc. [[In lieu of examining the
discrete sources of inequality in the present]{.underline}]{.mark},
antiracist ideology in particular depends on asserting [[superficial
analogies to]{.underline}]{.mark} those [[earlier]{.underline}]{.mark}
historical [[periods when racial exclusion]{.underline}]{.mark} and
discrimination [[were more direct impediments]{.underline}]{.mark} to
black Americans' and other nonwhites' social position and well-being.
Thus, for example, Michelle Alexander proposes that contemporary mass
incarceration be understood as a "new Jim Crow"6---though even she
allows that the analogy doesn't work---and expressions of outrage at
miscarriages of justice in the present commonly allude to practices
associated with slavery or the segregation era. As I have argued, [[such
assertions]{.underline}]{.mark} are not to be taken literally as
empirical claims; they [[are rhetorical.]{.mark} No sane or at all
knowledgeable person can believe that black Americans live under
similarly constrained and perilous conditions as they did a century ago
or longer.]{.underline} [[Those analogies]{.underline}]{.mark} and
allusions [[carry a silent preface:]{.underline}]{.mark}
"([[This]{.underline}]{.mark} incident/phenomenon/pattern [[makes it
seem as though) Nothing has changed]{.underline}]{.mark}." Yet [[the
claim itself presumes]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[things have changed
because the]{.underline}]{.mark} charge is essentially a denunciation of
objectionable conditions or incidents in the present as atavistic and a
call for others to regard them as such. [[Attempting to mobilize
outrage]{.underline}]{.mark} about some action or expression [[through
associating it with]{.underline}]{.mark} [discredited]{.underline} or
[[vilified]{.underline}]{.mark} views or
[[practices]{.underline}]{.mark} is a common gambit in hortatory
political rhetoric, more or less effective for a rally or leaflet. But
this antiracist politics [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} ineffective and even
[[destructive when it **takes the place of**]{.underline}]{.mark}
scholarly interpretation or **[[strategic political
analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}**.7 Political controversies in
contemporary New Orleans provide an apt frame of reference for
demonstrating antiracism's limitations, and class character, as a
politics. Antiracist political critique failed abysmally after Katrina
to mobilize significant opposition to elimination of low-income public
housing or to the ongoing destruction of public schools. In a context in
which black people participate as administrators, functionaries,
contractors, and investors---all in the blesséd name of racial
representation---in the commercial opportunities provided by
privatization and destruction of those institutions, that politics,
which posits an abstract "black community" against an equally abstract
"racism," could not provide persuasive responses to the blend of
underclass ideology that stigmatizes public housing as an incubator of a
degraded population or that proffers culturalist explanations for
failing schools.8 Debate over displacement for upscaling redevelopment,
including proliferation of the Airbnb industry, is another powerful case
in point in that city as elsewhere. In opting for a language of
"gentrification," opponents of displacement, often without necessarily
intending to do so, cloud a simple, straightforward dynamic---public
support of private developers' pursuit of rent-intensifying
redevelopment---with cultural implications that shift critique away from
the issue of using public authority to engineer upward redistribution
and impose hardship on relatively vulnerable residents. Instead,
discussion of gentrification slides into objections about display of
privilege, and lack of recognition or respect that, notwithstanding the
moral outrage that accompanies them, accept the logic of
rent-intensifying redevelopment as given and demand that newcomers
acknowledge and honor aboriginal habitus and practices and that the
"community" be involved in the processes of upgrading. The same racial
or cultural discourse has unhelpfully shaped opposition to
charterization of public education by focusing on the racial dimension
of the process. The fundamental problem with Teach For America and the
corporate privatizers for whom TFA are shock troops, after all, is not
that the missionaries are mainly white and unfamiliar with native
culture or even that many of them are tourists building extracurriculars
for their graduate and professional school dossiers. Those are only
idiosyncratically distasteful features of a particular line of attack on
one front in a broader war on public goods and the idea of social
solidarity, in line with marketization of all human needs. And that sort
of culturalist discourse also opens opportunities for petty, and not so
petty, entrepreneurship in the name of respect or recognition of the
community, within the logic of neoliberalization. Race reductionism
enables a sleight-of-hand in which benefits to individuals can appear to
be victories for the generic racial population or community. The more
deeply embedded a groupist notion of fairness or justice becomes as
common sense, t[he more easily that sleight-of-hand works under labels
like "community empowerment," "voice," "opportunity," or
"representation" to propel and legitimize accumulation by
dispossession]{.underline}.9 This takes us back to Sinclair's dictum,
which underlies the material truth of antiracist politics and other
expressions of identitarianism that are hostile to politics based on
class solidarities. Yet even the crudest self-interest depends on
ideological mystification for legitimacy. And race/racism---the former
term is inconceivable without the latter---has always worked in exactly
that way; only now, in the aftermath of the victories of the 1960s, it
can work to the benefit as well as the detriment of nonwhites. **[[The
cornerstone of race ideology, which]{.underline}]{.mark}** is not now
and **[[never has been incompatible with capitalism, is presumption of
ontological]{.underline}]{.mark}**-level **[[differences
among]{.underline}]{.mark}** human **[[populations apportioned into
racial groups.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Just as nineteenth and early
twentieth century white supremacists insisted that fundamental
differences preempt political alliances based on common material
conditions, antiracists posit whites' transhistorical---and thus
primordial---commitment to racial supremacy toward the same end. That's
the more insidious basis of the impulse to argue for the primacy of race
in contemporary politics via allusion to the past. [Like all forms of
race-reductionism [it masks a class-skewed agenda]{.mark}.]{.underline}
That underlying reality helps make sense both of why antiracists seem
unconcerned that their elevation of challenging disparities to the
paramount, if not exclusive, goal of **[[egalitarian politics is
entirely consistent]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[with
neolib]{.underline}]{.mark}eralism's regime of intensifying economic
[[inequality]{.underline}]{.mark} an[[d why their de facto alliance with
corporate]{.underline}]{.mark} and Wall Street
[[Democrats]{.underline}]{.mark} against the conventional left [[has
been automatic and untroubling.]{.mark}]{.underline} So I'll conclude as
I'd initially intended to begin this rumination, with several postulates
about black American political history to counter the idealist
mystifications that posit a primordial white racism or a
transhistorical, reified White Supremacy capable of acting in the world
on the conviction that, as Nihkil Singh and Joshua Clover most recently
characterized it in a Verso blogpost, "black lives matter less."
**[[Slavery was]{.underline}]{.mark}** fundamentally **[[a labor
relation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[not an extreme system of race
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To paraphrase Barbara and Karen
Fields, [[its objective was to produce cotton, sugar, tobacco, and
rice]{.underline}]{.mark}, not white supremacy. [[Its appeal to the
planter class was that it secured a labor force that had no rights or
recourse]{.underline}]{.mark}, not that it was a permanent sadistic
camp. Historian Kenneth Stampp quotes a slaveowner's succinct
explanation: "For what purpose does the master hold the servant? Is it
not that by his labor, he, the master, may accumulate wealth?"10 [An
irony of the view that defines slavery as institutionalized brutality is
its implication that slavery without extremes of brutalization might not
be objectionable. [The segregationist regime was]{.mark}]{.underline} an
historically specific social order [[based on disfranchisement of the
vast majority of blacks and a substantial percentage of
whites]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[imposed]{.underline}]{.mark} by southern
elites [[after defeat of the interracial]{.underline}]{.mark} Populist
[[political insurgency]{.underline}]{.mark} in the late nineteenth
century. It was defined by an extensive, legally codified system of
racial subordination. That order was not fully consolidated before World
War I, and its institutional foundations were crushed by the late 1960s.
That is, it was a regime that prevailed for roughly sixty years,
depending on location. **[There is no singular]{.underline}**,
transhistorical "**[Black]{.underline}** Liberation
**[Struggle]{.underline}**" or "Black Freedom Movement," and there never
has been. [Black Americans have engaged in many]{.underline} [different
forms of political expression]{.underline} in many different domains,
around many different issues, both those considered racial and not. They
have engaged in race-solidaristic formations and in close concert with
others, in class-based and multiclass alliances. As Cedric Johnson has
argued forcefully, [[contemporary]{.underline}]{.mark} scholarly
[[discussion reads "black politics]{.underline}]{.mark}"---the ethnic
pluralist group politics articulated mainly since the 1960s---back
[[anachronistically]{.underline}]{.mark} [[onto the
varying]{.underline}]{.mark} and pragmatically grounded [[political
expressions in which black Americans have engaged]{.underline}]{.mark}
since Emancipation, which he describes as "black American political
life." Political differentiation has been as common among black
Americans as among all others. Moreover, [[issues
bearing]{.underline}]{.mark} specifically [[on]{.underline}]{.mark} race
or [[racial disparities have never exhausted]{.underline}]{.mark}, or
exclusively defined, [[black]{.underline}]{.mark} Americans' expressed
[[political concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a corollary of 3, the
issues driving the postwar southern mass mobilization against
segregation and the emergent black interest-group urban politics in the
North and West, and the big city South, were distinct. Lumping them
together under a blanket construct like the "long civil rights movement"
does not help us comprehend the discrete features of either or, more
important, the distinct trajectories each set in motion. Black Power was
not a mass, radical insurgent movement. It was a militant expression of
ethnic pluralism. Radicals of various sorts---including ideological race
nationalists---occupied its fringes, but the driving and commanding
forces of Black Power politics were always the assertive elements within
the new black political and professional-managerial class that emerged
from opportunity structures opened by the victories of the Civil Rights
movement, the dynamics of urban demographic transition and incorporation
into governing regimes, and War on Poverty, Model Cities, and
foundation-funded programs. Nominally radical groups, such as the Black
Panther Party (BPP), the League of Revolutionary Black Workers, and
others with less cachet among the left, were not serious alternatives,
certainly not the romantic "roads tragically not taken" of post-New Left
fantasies. General Baker, longtime United Auto Workers activist and
co-founder of both the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM) and the
League of Revolutionary Black Workers, was emphatically clear that those
tendencies were entirely specific to Detroit and the centrality of the
union in local Democratic politics. The BPP was founded in 1966, and by
the end of the decade was already in disarray, especially outside
Oakland, as a result of police repression, to be sure, but also of their
political incoherence. [Neither Malcolm X, Frantz Fanon, C.L.R. James,
nor Stuart Hall can tell us anything strategically useful about the
black American political situation. Appeals to their putative wisdom
stem from academic leftists' romantic attachments and commitments to
race-reductionist politics]{.underline}. Malcolm was dead before nearly
all the big events understood to define "The Sixties" had occurred.
Fanon died several years before Malcolm, and in any case his focus was
always elsewhere; he gave only the most general, perfunctory attention
to the United States. James's time in the United States, as I have said,
was on the political equivalent of a tourist visa. He was not enmeshed
in black American politics and understood its internal and external
dynamics in only an abstract, formalist way. The same pertains to Stuart
Hall. [Attachments to the likes of Malcolm, Fanon, James, and Hall are
more totemic than intellectually or politically productive. There is a
more pernicious aspect of embrace of those figures' supposed cultural
authority. Each is read as propounding trans-contextual insights about
"race." And such insights are necessarily
race-reductionist]{.underline}.

causes of global aggression, it cannot afford to ignore the nature of
the beast that breeds it. And this means that it cannot afford to ignore
the insights of Marxism. [The same goes for
environmentalism]{.underline}. Wood argues that [[capitalism cannot

**[given]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the antisocial nature of [its drive

accommodate some degree of ecological care,]{.underline} especially when
the technology of environmental protection is itself profitably
marketable. [But [the essential irrationality]{.mark} of the drive for
capital accumulation, which subordinates everything to the requirements
of the self-expansion of capital and so-called **growth, [is]{.mark}
[unavoidably hostile to ecological balance]{.mark}.**]{.underline}'' The
old communist slogan ''Socialism or barbarism'' always seemed to some a
touch too apocalyptic. [[As history lurches towards]{.mark} the prospect

[The term \"horizon\" marks a division]{.underline}. Understood
spatially, the horizon is the line dividing the visible, separating
earth from sky. Understood temporally, the horizon converges with loss
in a metaphor for privation and depletion. T[he \"lost horizon\"
suggests abandoned projects, prior hopes that have now passed
away]{.underline}. Astrophysics offers a thrilling, even uncanny,
horizon: [the \"event horizon\" surrounding a black]{.underline} hole.
The event [horizon is the boundary beyond which events cannot
escape]{.underline}. Although \"event horizon\" denotes the curvature in
space/time effected by a singularity, it\'s not much different from the
spatial horizon. [Both evoke a fundamental division that we experience
as impossible to reach, and that we can neither escape nor
cross]{.underline}. [[I use \"horizon]{.mark}\" not to recall a
forgotten future but [to designate a dimension of experience]{.mark}
that [we can never lose, even if,]{.mark} lost in a fog or focused on
our feet, [we fail to see it]{.mark}. The horizon is Real in the sense
of impossible-we can never reach it-and in the sense of
actual]{.underline} (Jacques Lacan\'s notion of the Real includes both
these senses). [The horizon shapes our setting. We can lose our
bearings, but the horizon is a necessary dimension of our
actuality]{.underline}. [Whether the effect of a singularity or the
meeting of earth and sky, the horizon is the fundamental division
establishing where we are]{.underline}. With respect to politics, the
horizon that conditions our expe1ience is communism[. I get the term
\"communist horizon\" from Bruno Bosteels]{.underline}. In The Actuality
of Communism, Bosteels engages with the work of Alvaro Garcia Linera.
Garcia Linera ran as Evo Morales\'s vice presidential ru1ming mate in
the Bolivian Movement for Socialism-Political Instrument for the
Sovereignty of the Peoples (MAS-IPSP). He is the author of multiple
pieces on Marxism, politics, and sociology, at least one of which was
written while he served time in prison for promoting an armed uprising
(before becoming vice president of Bolivia, he fought in the Tupac
Kataii Guerrilla Army). [Bosteels quotes Garcia Linera\'s]{.underline}
[response to an interviewer\'s questions about his party\'s plans
following their electoral victim]{.underline})\': \"[[The general
horizon of the era is]{.mark} [communist]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"1 Garcia
Linera doesn\'t explain the term. Rather, as Bosteels points out,
[[Garcia Linera invokes the communist horizon]{.mark} [\"as if it were
the most natural thing in the world]{.mark}]{.underline},\" as if it
were [[so obvious]{.mark} as [to need neither explanation nor
justification]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} He assumes the communist
horizon as an ineducible feature of the political setting: \"We enter
the movement with our expecting and desiring eyes set upon the communist
horizon.\" [For Garcia Linera]{.underline}, **[[communism conditions the
actuality of politics]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Some]{.mark} on the Left
[dismiss the communist horizon as]{.mark} a [lost]{.mark}
horizon]{.underline}. For example, in a postmodern pluralist approach
that appeals to many on the Left, the economists writing as J. K .
[**[Gibson-Graham]{.underline}** [reject]{.underline}
[communism]{.underline}]{.mark}, offering \"post-capitalism\" in its
stead. [They argue that descriptions of capitalism]{.underline} as a
global system [miss the rich diversity of practices]{.underline},
relations, and desires [constituting yet exceeding the economy and so
advocate \"reading the economy for difference rather than
dominance\"]{.underline} (as if dominance neither presupposes nor relies
on difference).2 [[In their view, reading for difference opens up new
possibilities for politics]{.mark} as it reveals previously
unacknowledged loci of creative action within everyday economic
activitie]{.underline}s. Gibson-Graham do not present Marxism as a
failed ideology or communism as the fossilized remainder of an
historical expe1iment gone horribly wrong. On the contrary, they draw
inspiration from Marx's appreciation of the social character of labor.
They engage Jean-Luc Nancy\'s emphasis on communism as an idea that is
the \"index of a task of thought still and increasingly open.\" They
embrace the reclamation of the commons. And they are concerned with
neoliberalism\'s naturalization of the economy as a force exceeding the
capacity of people to steer or transform it. Yet at the same time,
[Gibson-Graham push away]{.underline} [from communism to
launch]{.underline} their vision of [postcapitalism]{.underline}.
[Communism is that against which they construct their alterative
conception of the economy. It\'s a constitutive force, present as a
shaping of the view they advocate]{.underline}. Even as Nancy\'s
evocation of communism serves as a horizon for their thinking, **[[they
explicitly jettison]{.mark} the term
\"[communism]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" which they position
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the object of \"widespread
aversion]{.underline}]{.mark}\" and [which they associate with the
\"dangers of posing a positivity, a nonnative
representation.\"]{.underline} Rejecting the positive notion of
\"communism,\" [they opt for a te1m that suggests an empty relationally
to the capitalist system they ostensibly deny,
\"post-capitalism]{.underline}.\" For Gibson-Graham, the term
\"capitalist\" is not a term of critique or opprobrium; it\'s not part
of a manifesto. The term is a cause of the political problems facing the
contemporary Left. They argue that the discursive dominance of
capitalism embeds the Left in paranoia, melancholia, and moralism.
[[Gibson-Graham\'s view is]{.mark} a specific instance of [a **general
assumption shared by leftists**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[who]{.underline}]{.mark} embrace a generic post-capitalism but
[[eschew]{.mark} a more [militant anticapitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Instead of actively opposing capitalism, [[this]{.mark} tendency
[redirects]{.mark} anticapitalist [energies into efforts to **open up
discussions** and **find ethical spaces for
decision**]{.mark}]{.underline}-and [[this]{.underline} **[in a world
where one bond trader can bring down a bank in]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[a matter of [minutes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I take the opposite
position. The dominance of [capitalism]{.underline}, the capitalist
system, **[is material]{.underline}**. Rather than entrapping us in
paranoid fantasy, [[an analysis that treats capitalism as a]{.mark}
global [system]{.mark} of appropriation, exploitation, and circulation
[that]{.mark} enriches the few as it [dispossesses the many]{.mark} and
that has to expend an enormous amount of energy in doing so [can
**anger, incite, and galvanize**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Historically, in
theory and in practice, [[critical analysis]{.mark} of capitalist
exploitation [has been a **powerful weapon in collective
struggle**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It persists as such today, in global
acknowledgment of the excesses of neoliberal capitalism. [As recently
became]{.underline} [clear in worldwide rioting, protest, and
revolution, linking multiple sites of exploitation to narrow channels of
privilege can replace **melancholic fatalism** with new assertions of
will, desire, and collective strength]{.underline}. The problem of [[the
Left]{.underline}]{.mark} hasn\'t been our adherence to a Marxist
critique of capitalism. It\'s that we have **[[lost sight of the
communist horizon]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [a glimpse of which new
political movements are starting to reveal. Sometimes
capitalists]{.underline}, conservatives, and liberal democrats [use a
rhetoric that treats communism as a lost horizon.]{.underline} But
[usually they keep communism firmly within their sight. They see
communism as a threat, twenty years after its ostensible
demise]{.underline}. To them, [communism is so threatening that they
premise political discussion on the repression of the communist
alternative.]{.underline} In response to left critiques of democracy for
its failure to protect the interests of poor and workingclass people,
conservatives and liberals alike scold that \"everybody knows\" and
\"history shows\" that communism doesn\'t work. Communism might be a
nice ideal, they concede, but it always leads to violent, authoritarian
excesses of power. [They shift the discussion to communism, trying to
establish the limits of reasonable debate]{.underline}. Their critique
of communism establishes the political space and condition of democracy.
[Before the conversation even gets going]{.underline}, liberals,
democrats, capitalists, and conservatives unite to block communism from
consideration. [[It\'s off the table]{.mark}.]{.underline} Those who
suspect that the inclusion of liberals and democrats in a set with
capitalists and conservatives is illegitimate are probably democrats
themselves. To determine whether they belong in the set of those who
fear communism, they should consider whether they think any evocation of
communism should come with qualifications, apologies, and condemnations
of past excesses. If the answer is \"yes,\" then we have a clear
indication that liberal democrats, and probably [[radical
democrats]{.underline}]{.mark} as well, still [consider communism a
threat that must be suppressed]{.underline}-**[and so they [belong in a
set with capitalists]{.mark} and conservatives]{.underline}**. [[All
are]{.mark} [anxious about **the forces** that **communist desire risks
unleashing**]{.mark}.]{.underline} There are good reasons for liberals,
democrats, capitalists, and conservatives to be anxious. Over the last
decade **[a return to [communism has re-energized the
Left]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Communism is again becoming a discourse
and vocabulary for the expression of universal, egalitarian, and
revolutionary ideals]{.underline}. In March 2009, the Birkbeck Institute
for the Humanities hosted a conference entitled \"On the Idea of
Communism.\" Initially planned for about 200 people, the conference
ultimately attracted over 1 ,200, requiring a spillover room to
accommodate those who couldn\'t fit in the primary auditorium. Since
then, multiple conferences-in Paris, Berlin, and New York-and
publications have followed, with contributions from such leading
scholars as Alain Badiou, Etienne Balibar, Bruno Bosteels, Susan
Buck-Morss, Costas Douzinas, Peter Hallward, Michael Hardt, Antonio
Neg1i, Jacques Ranciere, Alberto Toscano, and Slavoj Zizek. The
[conferences and publications consolidate discussions that have been
going on for decades]{.underline}. For over thirty years, Antonio [Negri
has sought to build a new approach to communism out of a Marxism
reworked via Spinoza and the Italian political experiments of the
1970]{.underline}s. The Empire trilogy that Negri coauthored with
Michael Hardt offers an affirmative, non-dialectical reconceptualization
of labor, power, and the State, a new theory of communism from below.
Alain [Badiou]{.underline} [has been occupied with communism for over
forty years]{.underline}, from his philosophical and political
engagement with Maoism, to his emphasis on the \"communist
invariants\"-egalitarian justice, disciplinary tenor, political
volunteerism, and trust in the people-to his recent appeal to the
communist Idea. [Communism is not a new interest for Slavoj Zizek
either]{.underline}. In early 2001 he put together a conference and
subsequent volume rethinking Lenin. Where Negri and Badiou reject the
Party and the State, Zizek retains a certain fidelity to Lenin. \"The
key \'Leninist\' lesson today,\" he writes, is that \"politics without
the organizational form of the Party is politics without politics.\"4 In
short, a vital area of radical philosophy considers communism a

[Some might object to my use of the second-person plural \"we\" and
\"us\"-what do you mean \"we\"? This objection is symptomatic of the
fragmentation that has pervaded the Left]{.underline} in Europe, the U
K, and North America. [[Reducing invocations of \"we\"]{.mark} and
\"us\" [to]{.mark} sociological statements requiting [a
concrete]{.mark}, delineable, empirical [referent]{.mark}, it [erases
the division necessary for politics]{.mark} as if interest and will were
only and automatically attributes of a fixed social
position]{.underline}. [**[We-skepticism]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[displaces the performative component of the second-person plural as it
**[treats collectivity with suspicion]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and
privileges]{.mark} a fantasy of [**individual singularity** and
**autonomy**]{.mark}. I write \"we\" hoping to enhance a partisan sense
of collectivity]{.underline}. [My break with conventions of w1iting that
reinforce individualism by admonishing attempts to think and speak as
part of a **larger collective subject is deliberate**.]{.underline} The
boundaries to what can be thought as politics in certain segments of the
post-structuralist and anarchist Left only benefit capital.
[[Some]{.mark} activists and theorists [think that **micropolitical
activities**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [whether [practices of
**self-cultivation**]{.mark} or individual consumer choices, [are more
important]{.mark} loci of action [than large-scale organized
movement]{.mark}]{.underline}[-]{.mark}[an assumption [which adds to the
**difficulty** of building new types]{.mark} of organizations [because
it makes thinking in terms of collectivity]{.mark} rarer,
[harder]{.mark}, and seemingly less \"fresh.\"]{.underline} [Similarly[,
some]{.mark} activists and theorists [treat aesthetic]{.mark}
object[s]{.mark} and creative works [as displaying]{.mark} a [political
potentiality missing from class]{.mark}es, parties, and
unions.]{.underline} [[This]{.mark} aesthetic focus **[disconnects
politics]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[from the **organized struggle of
working people**]{.underline}, [making **politics into what spectators
see**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Artistic products]{.underline}, whether
actual commodities or commodified experiences, thereby [**buttress
capital** as they circulate political affects while displacing political
struggles **from the streets to the galleries**. Spectators can
pay]{.underline} (or donate) [to feel radical without having to get
their hands dirty. The dominant class retains its position and the
contradiction between this class and the rest of us doesn\'t make itself
felt as such]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} celebration of momentary
[actions]{.mark}]{.underline} and singular happenings-[[the]{.underline}
**[playful disruption]{.underline}**]{.mark}, the temporarily
controversial film or novel-works the same way. [Some]{.underline} on
the anarchist and post-structuralist Left [[treat]{.mark} these
flickers]{.underline} **[[as the only proper]{.mark}
instances]{.underline}** [of a contemporary [left
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. A pointless action involving the
momentary expenditure of enormous effort-the artistic equivalent of the
5k and 10k runs to fight cancer, that is to say, to increase awareness
of cancer without actually doing much else-the singular happening
disconnects task from goal. [Any \"sense\" it makes]{.underline}, any
meaning or relevance it has, [is up to the spectator]{.underline}
(perhaps with a bit of guidance from curators and theorists). Occupation
contrasts sharply with the singular happening. Even as specific
occupations emerge from below rather than through a coordinated
strategy, their common form-including its images, slogans, terms, and
practices-links them together in a mass struggle. [The power of the
return of [communism stands or falls on its capacity to inspire]{.mark}
large-scale [organized collective struggle toward a
goal]{.mark}.]{.underline} For over thirty years, [[the **Left has
eschewed such a goal**]{.underline}, [accepting]{.underline}]{.mark}
[instead]{.underline} [[liberal notions that goals are]{.mark} strictly
[individual lifestyle choices]{.mark} or social-democratic claims that
history already solved basic problems of distribution]{.underline} with
the compromise of regulated markets and welfare states -- a solution the
Right rejected and capitalism destroyed. [[The Left]{.mark} failed to
defend a vision of a better world]{.underline}, an egalitarian world of
common production by and for the collective people. [Instead, it
[accommodated capital, succumbing to the lures of individualism]{.mark},
consumerism, [**competition**, and privilege]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and
proceeding as if there really were no alternative to states that rule in
the interests of markets. [Marx expressed the basic principle of the
alte]{.mark}rnative]{.underline} over a hundred years ago: **[[from each
according to ability, to each according to need]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[This principle contains the urgency of the struggle for its own
realization. We don\'t have to continue to live in the wake of left
failure, stuck in the repetitions of crises and spectacle. [In light of
the **planetary climate disaster**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and
the]{.mark} **ever-[intensifying]{.mark} global [class war]{.mark}** as
states redistribute wealth to the rich in the name of austerity, **[the
absence of a common goal is the absence of a
future]{.mark}**]{.underline} (other than the ones imagined in
post-apocalyptic scenarios like Mad Max). [The premise of communism is
that collective determination of collective conditions is possible, if
we want it.]{.underline} To help incite this desire, to add to its
reawakening force and presence, I treat \"communism\" as a tag for six
features of our current setting: 1. A specific image of the Soviet Union
and its collapse; 2 . A present, increasingly powerful force; 3 . The
sovereignty of the people; 4. The common and the commons; 5. The
egalitarian and universalist desire that cuts through the circuits and
practices in which we are trapped; 6. The party. The first two features
can be loosely associated with the politics that configures itself via a
history linked to the end of the Soviet Union as a state, as refracted
through the dominance of the US as a state. What matters here is less
the historical narrative than the expression of communism as the force
of an absence. My discussion of these first two features highlights [how
the absence of communism shapes our contemporary setting]{.underline}.
In the sequence narrative as the triumph of capitalism and liberal
democracy, [[the communist horizon makes itself felt as a \"**signifying
stress**]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} This is Eric L. Santner\'s term for a
way that reality expresses its nonidentity with itself. As Santner
explains, the \"social formation in which we find ourselves immersed\"
is \"fissured by lack\" and \"permeated by inconsistency and
incompleteness.\" **[[The lack calls out to us]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Inconsistency and incompleteness make themselves felt. \"What is
registered,\" Santner explains, \"are not so much forgotten deeds but
forgotten failures to act. \"7 [The frenetic activity of
contemporary]{.underline} communicative [capitalism]{.underline}
[deflects us away from these gaps]{.underline}. [[New
entertainments]{.underline}, [unshakeable burdens,
and]{.underline}]{.mark} [growing [debt displace our attention toward
the immediate]{.mark} and the coming-up-next [as they attempt to **drown
out** the]{.mark} forceful effects of the [unrealized]{.mark}-the
unrealized potentials of [unions and collective
struggle]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the unrealized claims for [equality
distorted by a culture that celebrates]{.mark} the excesses of [the very
rich]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the unrealized achievements of [collective
solidarity in redressing poverty and redistributing risks and
rewards]{.mark}]{.underline}. The first two chapters thus treat the
gaps, fissures, and lack Santner theorizes as signifying stresses in
terms of a missing communism that makes itself felt in the setting
configured by its alleged failure and defeat.

#### The alternative is to orient political and social struggle toward the communist horizon -- this redirection is crucial to redefine the political futures psychoanalytically imagineable-- anything less is mere apologism for continued leftist failure

[The term \"horizon\" marks a division]{.underline}. Understood
spatially, the horizon is the line dividing the visible, separating
earth from sky. Understood temporally, the horizon converges with loss
in a metaphor for privation and depletion. T[he \"lost horizon\"
suggests abandoned projects, prior hopes that have now passed
away]{.underline}. Astrophysics offers a thrilling, even uncanny,
horizon: [the \"event horizon\" surrounding a black]{.underline} hole.
The event [horizon is the boundary beyond which events cannot
escape]{.underline}. Although \"event horizon\" denotes the curvature in
space/time effected by a singularity, it\'s not much different from the
spatial horizon. [Both evoke a fundamental division that we experience
as impossible to reach, and that we can neither escape nor
cross]{.underline}. [[I use \"horizon]{.mark}\" not to recall a
forgotten future but [to designate a dimension of experience]{.mark}
that [we can never lose, even if,]{.mark} lost in a fog or focused on
our feet, [we fail to see it]{.mark}. The horizon is Real in the sense
of impossible-we can never reach it-and in the sense of
actual]{.underline} (Jacques Lacan\'s notion of the Real includes both
these senses). [The horizon shapes our setting. We can lose our
bearings, but the horizon is a necessary dimension of our
actuality]{.underline}. [Whether the effect of a singularity or the
meeting of earth and sky, the horizon is the fundamental division
establishing where we are]{.underline}. With respect to politics, the
horizon that conditions our expe1ience is communism[. I get the term
\"communist horizon\" from Bruno Bosteels]{.underline}. In The Actuality
of Communism, Bosteels engages with the work of Alvaro Garcia Linera.
Garcia Linera ran as Evo Morales\'s vice presidential ru1ming mate in
the Bolivian Movement for Socialism-Political Instrument for the
Sovereignty of the Peoples (MAS-IPSP). He is the author of multiple
pieces on Marxism, politics, and sociology, at least one of which was
written while he served time in prison for promoting an armed uprising
(before becoming vice president of Bolivia, he fought in the Tupac
Kataii Guerrilla Army). [Bosteels quotes Garcia Linera\'s]{.underline}
[response to an interviewer\'s questions about his party\'s plans
following their electoral victim]{.underline})\': \"[[The general
horizon of the era is]{.mark} [communist]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"1 Garcia
Linera doesn\'t explain the term. Rather, as Bosteels points out,
[[Garcia Linera invokes the communist horizon]{.mark} [\"as if it were
the most natural thing in the world]{.mark}]{.underline},\" as if it
were [[so obvious]{.mark} as [to need neither explanation nor
justification]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} He assumes the communist
horizon as an ineducible feature of the political setting: \"We enter
the movement with our expecting and desiring eyes set upon the communist
horizon.\" [For Garcia Linera]{.underline}, **[[communism conditions the
actuality of politics]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Some]{.mark} on the Left
[dismiss the communist horizon as]{.mark} a [lost]{.mark}
horizon]{.underline}. For example, in a postmodern pluralist approach
that appeals to many on the Left, the economists writing as J. K .
[**[Gibson-Graham]{.underline}** [reject]{.underline}
[communism]{.underline}]{.mark}, offering \"post-capitalism\" in its
stead. [They argue that descriptions of capitalism]{.underline} as a
global system [miss the rich diversity of practices]{.underline},
relations, and desires [constituting yet exceeding the economy and so
advocate \"reading the economy for difference rather than
dominance\"]{.underline} (as if dominance neither presupposes nor relies
on difference).2 [[In their view, reading for difference opens up new
possibilities for politics]{.mark} as it reveals previously
unacknowledged loci of creative action within everyday economic
activitie]{.underline}s. Gibson-Graham do not present Marxism as a
failed ideology or communism as the fossilized remainder of an
historical expe1iment gone horribly wrong. On the contrary, they draw
inspiration from Marx's appreciation of the social character of labor.
They engage Jean-Luc Nancy\'s emphasis on communism as an idea that is
the \"index of a task of thought still and increasingly open.\" They
embrace the reclamation of the commons. And they are concerned with
neoliberalism\'s naturalization of the economy as a force exceeding the
capacity of people to steer or transform it. Yet at the same time,
[Gibson-Graham push away]{.underline} [from communism to
launch]{.underline} their vision of [postcapitalism]{.underline}.
[Communism is that against which they construct their alterative
conception of the economy. It\'s a constitutive force, present as a
shaping of the view they advocate]{.underline}. Even as Nancy\'s
evocation of communism serves as a horizon for their thinking,
**[[they]{.mark} [explicitly jettison]{.mark} the term
\"[communism]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" which they position
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the object of \"widespread
aversion]{.underline}]{.mark}\" and [which they associate with the
\"dangers of posing a positivity, a nonnative
representation.\"]{.underline} Rejecting the positive notion of
\"communism,\" [they opt for a te1m that suggests an empty relationally
to the capitalist system they ostensibly deny,
\"post-capitalism]{.underline}.\" For Gibson-Graham, the term
\"capitalist\" is not a term of critique or opprobrium; it\'s not part
of a manifesto. The term is a cause of the political problems facing the
contemporary Left. They argue that the discursive dominance of
capitalism embeds the Left in paranoia, melancholia, and moralism.
[[Gibson-Graham\'s view is]{.mark} a specific instance of [a **general
assumption shared by leftists**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[who]{.underline}]{.mark} embrace a generic post-capitalism but
[[eschew]{.mark} a more [militant anticapitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Instead of actively opposing capitalism, [[this]{.mark} tendency
[redirects]{.mark} anticapitalist [energies into efforts to **open up
discussions** and **find ethical spaces for
decision**]{.mark}]{.underline}-and [[this]{.underline} **[in a world
where one bond trader can bring down a bank in]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[a matter of [minutes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I take the opposite
position. The dominance of [capitalism]{.underline}, the capitalist
system, **[is material]{.underline}**. Rather than entrapping us in
paranoid fantasy, [[an analysis that treats capitalism as a]{.mark}
global [system]{.mark} of appropriation, exploitation, and circulation
[that]{.mark} enriches the few as it [dispossesses the many]{.mark} and
that has to expend an enormous amount of energy in doing so [can
**anger, incite, and galvanize**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Historically, in
theory and in practice, [[critical analysis]{.mark} of capitalist
exploitation [has been a **powerful weapon in collective
struggle**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It persists as such today, in global
acknowledgment of the excesses of neoliberal capitalism. [As recently
became]{.underline} [clear in worldwide rioting, protest, and
revolution, linking multiple sites of exploitation to narrow channels of
privilege can replace **melancholic fatalism** with new assertions of
will, desire, and collective strength]{.underline}. The problem of [[the
Left]{.underline}]{.mark} hasn\'t been our adherence to a Marxist
critique of capitalism. It\'s that we have **[[lost sight of the
communist horizon]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [a glimpse of which new
political movements are starting to reveal. Sometimes
capitalists]{.underline}, conservatives, and liberal democrats [use a
rhetoric that treats communism as a lost horizon.]{.underline} But
[usually they keep communism firmly within their sight. They see
communism as a threat, twenty years after its ostensible
demise]{.underline}. To them, [communism is so threatening that they
premise political discussion on the repression of the communist
alternative.]{.underline} In response to left critiques of democracy for
its failure to protect the interests of poor and workingclass people,
conservatives and liberals alike scold that \"everybody knows\" and
\"history shows\" that communism doesn\'t work. Communism might be a
nice ideal, they concede, but it always leads to violent, authoritarian
excesses of power. [They shift the discussion to communism, trying to
establish the limits of reasonable debate]{.underline}. Their critique
of communism establishes the political space and condition of democracy.
[Before the conversation even gets going]{.underline}, liberals,
democrats, capitalists, and conservatives unite to block communism from
consideration. [[It\'s off the table]{.mark}.]{.underline} Those who
suspect that the inclusion of liberals and democrats in a set with
capitalists and conservatives is illegitimate are probably democrats
themselves. To determine whether they belong in the set of those who
fear communism, they should consider whether they think any evocation of
communism should come with qualifications, apologies, and condemnations
of past excesses. If the answer is \"yes,\" then we have a clear
indication that liberal democrats, and probably [[radical
democrats]{.underline}]{.mark} as well, still [consider communism a
threat that must be suppressed]{.underline}-**[and so they [belong in a
set with capitalists]{.mark} and conservatives]{.underline}**. [[All
are]{.mark} [anxious about **the forces** that **communist desire risks
unleashing**]{.mark}.]{.underline} There are good reasons for liberals,
democrats, capitalists, and conservatives to be anxious. Over the last
decade **[a return to [communism has re-energized the
Left]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Communism is again becoming a discourse
and vocabulary for the expression of universal, egalitarian, and
revolutionary ideals]{.underline}. In March 2009, the Birkbeck Institute
for the Humanities hosted a conference entitled \"On the Idea of
Communism.\" Initially planned for about 200 people, the conference
ultimately attracted over 1 ,200, requiring a spillover room to
accommodate those who couldn\'t fit in the primary auditorium. Since
then, multiple conferences-in Paris, Berlin, and New York-and
publications have followed, with contributions from such leading
scholars as Alain Badiou, Etienne Balibar, Bruno Bosteels, Susan
Buck-Morss, Costas Douzinas, Peter Hallward, Michael Hardt, Antonio
Neg1i, Jacques Ranciere, Alberto Toscano, and Slavoj Zizek. The
[conferences and publications consolidate discussions that have been
going on for decades]{.underline}. For over thirty years, Antonio [Negri
has sought to build a new approach to communism out of a Marxism
reworked via Spinoza and the Italian political experiments of the
1970]{.underline}s. The Empire trilogy that Negri coauthored with
Michael Hardt offers an affirmative, non-dialectical reconceptualization
of labor, power, and the State, a new theory of communism from below.
Alain [Badiou]{.underline} [has been occupied with communism for over
forty years]{.underline}, from his philosophical and political
engagement with Maoism, to his emphasis on the \"communist
invariants\"-egalitarian justice, disciplinary tenor, political
volunteerism, and trust in the people-to his recent appeal to the
communist Idea. [Communism is not a new interest for Slavoj Zizek
either]{.underline}. In early 2001 he put together a conference and
subsequent volume rethinking Lenin. Where Negri and Badiou reject the
Party and the State, Zizek retains a certain fidelity to Lenin. \"The
key \'Leninist\' lesson today,\" he writes, is that \"politics without
the organizational form of the Party is politics without politics.\"4 In
short, a vital area of radical philosophy considers communism a
contemporary name for emancipation)\', egalitarian politics and form
part of the communist legacy. These ongoing theoretical discussions
overlap with the changing political sequences marked by 1968 and 1989.
They also overlap with the spread of neoliberal capitalist domination, a

It is in the light of this more subtle perspective on the real that
zizek has also revised his approach to the question of ideology. In the
sublime object of ideology, zizek developed his famous inversion of the
classical \'false consciousness\' thesis. Thus ideology does not conceal
or distort an underlying reality (human nature, social interests etc.)
But rather reality itself cannot be reproduced without ideological
mystification (zizek, 1989: 28). What ideology offers is the symbolic
construction of reality -- the ultimate fantasy -- as a way to escape
the traumatic effects of the real. Reality is always a \'virtual\' take
on the real; virtualization that can never fully overcome the real or
achieve homeostasis. In the language of laclau and mouffe, this means
that society as an integrated unity is universally impossible precisely
because of the constitutive excess of the real qua the unmasterable
negativity upon which every positivization finally depends. And it is
here that ideology performs its supreme conjuring trick.
[What]{.underline} [[ideology aims at]{.underline}]{.mark} [is a
[fantasmatic re-staging of]{.mark}]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
[[encounter with the real]{.underline}]{.mark} in [[such]{.mark} a way
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [[impossibility of society
is translated into]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[theft of society by
some]{.mark}]{.underline} historical [[other]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
[[nazi ideology]{.underline}]{.mark}, [for example, i]{.underline}t
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} [the contingent figure of the]{.underline}
[[jew]{.underline}]{.mark} [who is]{.underline}
[[made]{.underline}]{.mark} [directly]{.underline} [[responsible
for]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
[[theft]{.underline}]{.mark}/[sabotage]{.underline} [[of social
harmony]{.underline}]{.mark} [-- thereby concealing the traumatic fact
that social harmony never existed and that it is an inherent
impossibility]{.underline} (1989: 125-7; 1993: 203-4). [[By
imputing]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[status of the
real to]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[particular other,]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[dream of holistic fulfilment -- through]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[elimination]{.underline}]{.mark}, [expulsion or suppression [of the
other -- is]{.mark}]{.underline} thereby
[[sustained]{.mark}.]{.underline} More recently, however, Zizek has
developed a new twist to this perspective. Ideology not only constructs
a certain image of fulfillment (Plato\'s City of Reason, the Aryan
Community, multiculturalist harmony etc..), it also endeavours to
regulate a certain distance from it.
[4](http://www.lacan.com/zizek-daly.htm#4) On the one hand we have the
ideological fantasy of being reconciled with the Thing (of total
fulfilment), but, on the other, with the built-in proviso that we do not
come too close to it. The (Lacanian) reason for this is clear: if you
come too close to the Thing then it either shatters/evaporates (like the
frescoes in Fellini\'s Roma) or it provokes unbearable anxiety and
psychical disintegration. Crucial here is the status of the category of
the impossible For Zizek impossibility is not the kind of neutral
category that we tend to find in Laclau and Mouffe (as in their
impossibility-of-Society thesis) where it tends to connote a basic
constitutive frontier of antagonism. Like the immanent markers of the
Real, impossibility gets caught up in ideology and is configured in such
a way that it both structures reality and determines the coordinates of
what is actually possible. As Zizek argues in this book, beyond the
prima facie ideological operation of translating impossibility into an
external obstacle there is a further deeper stage to the operation: that
is, the \"very elevation of something into impossibility as a means of
postponing or avoiding encountering it\". Ideology is the impossible
dream not simply in terms of overcoming impossibility but in terms of
sustaining that impossibility in an acceptable way. That is to say, the
idea of overcoming is sustained as a deferred moment of reconciliation
without having to go through the pain of overcoming as such. The central
issue is one of proximity; of maintaining a critical distance by keeping
the Thing in focus (like the image on a screen) but without coming so
close that it begins to distort and decompose. A typical example would
be that of someone who fantasizes about an ideal object (a sexual
partner, promotion, retirement etc.) and when they actually encounter
the object, they are confronted with the Real of their fantasy; the
object loses its ideality, The (ideological) trick, therefore, is to
keep the object at a certain distance in order to sustain the
satisfaction derived from the fantasy \"if only I had x I could fulfil
my dream\". Ideology regulates this fantasmatic distance in order to, as
it were, avoid the Real in the impossible: i.e. the traumatic aspects
involved in any real (impossible) change. This allows for a more nuanced
reading of ideologies. Let us take the case of an international crisis:
the so-called \"liberation of Kuwait\" during the 1990s Gulf conflict.
Here the ideological discourse tended to operate along the following
tines: \"we must achieve the liberation of Kuwait \... while recognizing
that any true liberation (i.e. abolishing Kuwait\'s feudal dynasty and
setting up democratic structures) is currently impossible.\" And do we
not have something similar with the so-called New World Order? Any real
(or indeed Real) attempt to establish such an order would inevitably
require traumatic far-reaching changes: global democracy based on
universal rights, popular participation, the eradication of poverty and
social exclusion (etc.) as part of a genuine \"reflexive
modernization\". However, what we actually have is the routine
invocation of the New World Order in term of an indefinite ideal that
functions precisely as a way of preventing any real movement towards it.
In the Kantian terms of the sublime, any convergence with what might be
called the Bush-Blair \"axis of Good\" would become an unbearable evil.
So we have the same type of ideological supplement at work: \"we are
moving towards a New World Order that will not tolerate the Saddam
Husseins of this world\... while recognizing that a true New World Order
(one that would be intolerant of all the autocrats, royal families and
the corporate dictatorships of global capitalism) is currently/always
impossible . . .\" In this way, impossibility loses its innocence and,
far from comprising a simple repressed dimension, is rather something
that can be seen to function as an implicit-obscene ideological
supplement in today\'s realpolitik. There is a further potential danger.

[7](http://www.lacan.com/zizek-daly.htm#7) and focuses instead on the
very organizing principles of today\'s social reality: the principles of
global liberal capitalism. This requires some care and subtlety. For far
too long, Marxism has been bedeviled by an almost fetishistic economism
that has tended towards political morbidity With the likes of Hilferding
and Gramsci, and move recently Laclau and Mouffe, crucial theoretical
advances have been made that enable the transcendence of all forms of
economism. In this new context, however, Zizek argues that the problem
that now presents itself is almost that of the opposite fetish. That is
to say, the prohibitive anxieties surrounding the taboo of economism can
function as a way of not engaging with economic reality and as a way of
implicitly accepting the latter as a basic horizon of existence. In an
ironic Freudian- Lacanian twist, the few of economism can end up
reinforcing a de facto economic necessity in respect of contemporary
capitalism (i.e. the initial prohibition conjures up the very thing it
fears). This is not to endorse any kind of retrograde return to
economism. Zizek\'s point is rather that in rejecting economism we
should not lose sight of the systemic power of capital in shaping the
fives and destinies of humanity and our very sense of the possible. In
particular we should not overlook Marx\'s central insight that in order
to create a universal global system the forces of capitalism seek to
conceal the politico-discursive violence of its construction through a
kind of gentrification of that system. What is persistently denied by
neo-liberals; such as Rorty (1989) and Fukuyama (1992) is that the
gentrification of global liberal [[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}
i[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} [one whose]{.underline}
\"[[universalism]{.underline}]{.mark}\" [fundamentally]{.underline}
[[reproduces and depends upon a disavowed violence that excludes vast
sectors of the world]{.underline}]{.mark}\'s [population]{.underline}.
In this way, neo-liberal ideology attempts to naturalize capitalism by
presenting its outcomes of winning and losing as if they were simply a
matter of chance and sound judgement in a neutral marketplace.
Capitalism does indeed create a space for a certain diversity, at least
for the central capitalist regions, but it is neither neutral nor ideal
and its price in terms of social exclusion is exorbitant. That is to
say, [[the human cost in]{.mark} terms of inherent [global poverty and
degraded \"life-chances\" cannot be calculated within]{.mark} the
[existing]{.mark} economic [rationale]{.mark}]{.underline} [and, in
consequence,]{.underline} [[social exclusion remains]{.mark} mystified
and [nameless]{.mark}]{.underline} (viz. the patronizing reference to
the \"developing world\"). And Zizek\'s point is that this mystification
is magnified through capitalism\'s profound capacity to ingest its own
excesses and negativity: to redirect (or misdirect) social antagonisms
and to absorb them within a culture of differential affirmation. Instead
of Bolshevism, the tendency today is towards a kind of political
boutiquism that is readily sustained by postmodern forms of consumerism
and lifestyle. Against this Zizek argues for a new universalism whose
primary ethical directive is to confront the fact that our forms of
social existence are founded on exclusion on a global scale. While it is
perfectly true that universalism can never become Universal (it will
always require a hegemonic-particular embodiment in order to have any
meaning), what is novel about Zizek\'s universalism is that it would not
attempt to conceal this fact or to reduce the status of the abject Other
to that of a \"glitch\" in an otherwise sound matrix. Risking the
impossible The response of the left to global capitalism cannot be one
of retreat into the nation-state or into organicist forms of
\"community\" and popular identities that currently abound in Europe and
elsewhere. For Zizek it is, rather, a question of working with the very
excesses that, in a Lacanian sense, are in capitalism more than
capitalism. It is a question, therefore, of transcending the provincial
\"universalism\" of capitalism. To illustrate the point, Zizek draws
attention to the category of \"intellectual property\" and the
increasingly absurd attempts to establish restrictive dominion over
technological advances - genetic codes, DNA structures, digital
communications, pharmaceutical breakthroughs, computer programs and so
on - that either affect us all and/or to which there is a sense of
common human entitlement Indeed, the modern conjuncture of capitalism is
more and more characterized by a prohibitive culture: the widespread
repression of those forms of research and development that have real
emancipatory potential beyond exclusive profiteering; the restriction of
information that has direct consequences for the future of humanity; the
fundamental denial that social equality could be sustained by the
abundance generated by capitalism. Capitalism typically endeavors to
constrain the very dimensions of the universal that are enabled by it
and simultaneously to resist all those developments that disclose its
specificity-artificiality as merely one possible mode of being. The
left, therefore, must seek to subvert these ungovernable excesses in the
direction of a political (and politicizing) universalism; or what
Balibar would call égaliberté. This means that the left should demand
more globalization not less. Where neo-liberals speak the language of
freedom - either in terms of individual liberty or the free movement of
goods and capital - the left should use this language to combat today\'s
racist obsessions with \"economic refugees\", \"immigrants\" and so on,
and insist that freedoms are meaningless without the social resources to
participate in those freedoms. Where there is talk of universal rights,
the left must affirm a responsibility to the universal; one that
emphasizes real human solidarity and does not lose sight of the abject
within differential discourses. Reversing the well-known
environmentalists\' slogan, we might say that the left has to involve
itself in thinking locally and acting globally. That is to say, it
should attend to the specificity of today\'s political identities within
the context of their global (capitalist) conditions of possibility
precisely in order to challenge those conditions. Yet here I would
venture that, despite clearly stated differences (Butler et al., 2000),
the political perspective of Zizek is not necessarily opposed to that of
Laclau and Mouffe and that a combined approach is fully possible. While
Zizek is right to stress the susceptibility of today\'s \"alternative\"
forms of hegemonic engagement to deradicalization within a
postmodern-p.c. imaginary - a kind of hegemonization of the very terrain
(the politico-cultural conditions of possibility) that produces and
predisposes the contemporary logics of hegemony - it is equally true to
say that the type of political challenge that Zizek has in mind is one
that can only advance through the type of hegemonic subversion that
Laclau and Mouffe have consistently stressed in their work. The very
possibility of a political universalism is one that depends on a certain
hegemonic breaking out of the existing conventions/grammar of hegemonic
engagement. It is along these lines that Zizek affirms the need for a
more radical intervention in the political imagination. The modem
(Machiavellian) view of politics is usually presented in terms of a
basic tension between (potentially) unlimited demands/appetites and
limited resources; a view which is implicit in the predominant \"risk
society\" perspective where the central (almost Habermasian) concern is
with more and better scientific information. The political truth of
today\'s world, however, is rather the opposite of this view. That is to
say, the demands of the official left (especially the various
incarnations of the Third Way left) tend to articulate extremely modest
demands in the face of a virtually unlimited capitalism that is more
than capable of providing every person on this planet with a civilized
standard of living. [For Zizek, a [confrontation with]{.mark} the
obscenities of abundance]{.underline} [[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}
[also [requires]{.mark}]{.underline} a transformation of the
ethico-political imagination. It is no longer a question of developing
ethical guidelines within the existing political framework (the various
institutional and corporate \"ethical committees\") but of developing a
[[politicization of ethics]{.underline}]{.mark}; [an ethics of the
Real]{.underline}. [8](http://www.lacan.com/zizek-daly.htm#8) [The
starting point here is]{.underline} [[an insistence on
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [unconditional [autonomy of the
subject]{.mark}]{.underline}; [of accepting that as]{.underline} [[human
beings]{.underline}]{.mark} [we]{.underline} [[are ultimately
responsible for our actions]{.mark} and being-in-the-world up to and
including the construction of the capitalist system itself]{.underline}
Far from simple norm-making or refining/reinforcing existing social
protocol, [[an ethics of the Real]{.underline}]{.mark} [tends
to]{.underline} [[emerge through]{.underline}]{.mark} [norm-breaking and
in finding new directions that, by definition, involve]{.underline}
[[traumatic]{.underline}]{.mark} [changes]{.underline}: i.e. the Real in
genuine ethical challenge. [An]{.underline} [ethics of the
Real]{.underline} [[does not]{.underline}]{.mark} simply [[defer to the
impossible]{.underline}]{.mark} (or infinite Otherness) as an
unsurpassable -horizon that already marks every act as a failure,
incomplete and so on. [Rather]{.underline}, [such an ethics is one that
[fully accepts contingency but]{.mark} which [is]{.mark} nonetheless
[prepared to risk]{.mark} the [impossible in]{.mark}]{.underline} [the
sense of [breaking out of standardized positions]{.mark}]{.underline}.
We might say that it is an ethics which is not only politically
motivated but which also draws its strength from the political itself.
For Zizek an ethics of the Real (or Real ethics) means that [[we cannot
rely on any]{.mark} form of [symbolic Other that would endorse
our]{.mark}]{.underline} ([in)decisions and (in)[actions]{.mark}: for
example, the \'neutral\' financial data of the stockmarkets;
the]{.underline} [[expert knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark} [of Beck\'s
\'new modernity\' scientists]{.underline}; [the eco­nomic and military
councils of the New World Order; the various (formal and informal)
[tribunals of political correct­ness]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[or
any]{.underline}]{.mark} [of the mysterious [laws of God, nature or the
market]{.mark}]{.underline}. What Zizek affirms is a radical culture of
ethical iden­tification for the left in which the alternative forms of
mili­tancy must first of all be militant with themselves. That is to say,
they must be militant in the fundamental ethical sense of not relying on
any external/higher authority and in the development of a political
imagination that, like Zizek\'s own thought, exhorts us to risk the
impossible.

#### Political agency is psychoanalytically structured by drive -- orienting our political horizons away from communism makes failure satisfying and forecloses the political itself 

**Dean 12** \[Jodi, Professor of Political Science at Hobart and William
Smith Colleges, *The Communist Horizon*, Verso: Brooklyn, NY, 2012, p.
65-67\]

For the Left, democracy is the form the loss of communism takes. Rather
than fighting for a collective ideal, engaging in a struggle on behalf
of the rest of us, [[the Left]{.mark} repetitively [invokes democracy,
calling for what is already there]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [These
invocations]{.underline}]{.mark} [of democracy [take on a
pattern]{.mark} that [Lacan describes via the psychoanalytic notion of
**drive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Like desire, [[drive refers to a way
that the subject arranges her enjoyment]{.underline}]{.mark}
(jouissance). [[With]{.underline}]{.mark} respect to [[desire, enjoyment
is what the subject can never reach, what the subject wants but never
gets]{.underline} -- **[oh, that\'s not it]{.underline}**. [Drive
differs in that enjoyment comes from missing one\'s
goal;]{.underline}]{.mark} [it\'s what the subject gets, even if she
doesn\'t want it]{.underline}.22 Enjoyment is that little extra charge
which keeps the subject keeping on. [The subject\'s [repeated yet ever
failing efforts]{.mark} to reach her goal [become **satisfying on their
own**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Left appeals]{.underline}]{.mark} to
democracy [[take on the structure of the drive insofar as **they circle
around and around**.]{.underline} [We perpetually miss our goal and
**get satisfaction through this very missing**]{.underline}]{.mark}[**.
[Or we don\'t even have an actual goal, and we take the absence of a
goal to be a strength. We talk, complain, and
protest]{.mark}**.]{.underline} We make groups on Facebook[. We sign
petitions and forward them to everyone in our contact list.]{.underline}
[**[Activity becomes passivity]{.underline}**, **[our stuckness in a
circuit]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [which is then mourned as the absence of
ideas or even the loss of the political itself]{.underline} and then
routed yet again through a plea for democracy, although it doesn\'t take
a genius to know that the real problem is capitalism. [[What leftists
call the loss of the political is the **fog they wander through**
because they\'ve **lost sight of the communist
horizon**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Some contemporary theorists commend
drive\'s sublimation, its substitution of partial objects and the bits
of enjoyment accompanying repetitions of a process for the impossible
object of desire. [[Multiple voices]{.underline}]{.mark} in networked
and digital media circuits, for example, [[celebrate]{.mark}
communicative capitalism for its provision of opportunities for [small
victories and momentary pleasures]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[Millions die
in war and poverty, but at least we have the
internet]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [Others admire drive\'s creative
destruction]{.underline}, the way its dissolution of the old is the
opening to the new. Admittedly, [repeating the same act over and over
can shift from order to chaos]{.underline}-it\'s one thing to scratch an
itch a couple of times; [it\'s something else entirely to claw through
to the bone]{.underline}. The reiterations that fail to respond to
changes in their setting themselves change the setting. But [the embrace
of drive as destruction,]{.underline} like the view of drive as
sublimation, [treats a feature of our setting as an alternative without
drawing the necessary separation]{.underline}: **[what makes it a
feature of a different formation]{.underline}**, a different politics,
or even a critique? In the contemporary networks of communicative
capitalism, drive is a feedback circuit that captures our best energies.
[[Invigorating communism as a political alternative requires
**amplifying the collective desire** that can **cut through these
affective networks**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Their basic frame for politics reconfirms the failures of the Left, turning debate into a Vampires' Castle where the propagation of guilt and cycles of pseudo-activity overcome meaningful theorizing and political change -- this [destroys]{.underline} resistance to capitalism.

**Fisher 13** (Mark Fisher, commissioning editor at Zer0 Books,
programme Leader of the MA in Aural and Visual Cultures at Goldsmiths,
University of London, lecturer at the University of East London,
"Exiting the Vampire Castle," The North Star, November 22, 2013)

Inside the Vampires' Castle The first configuration is what I came to
call the Vampires' Castle. **[The [Vampires' Castle specialises
in]{.mark} propagating [guilt]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [It is driven by
**a priest's desire to excommunicate and condemn**]{.underline}, **[an
academic-pedant's desire to be the first to be seen to spot a
mistake]{.underline}**, and **[a hipster's desire to be one of the
in-crowd]{.underline}**. [The danger in [attacking the Vampires'
Castle]{.mark} is that **it [can look as if]{.mark}**]{.underline} --
and **[it will do everything it can to reinforce this
thought]{.underline}** -- **[that [one is also attacking the struggles
against racism]{.mark}, sexism, heterosexism]{.underline}**. **[But, far
from being the only legitimate expression of such struggles, the
Vampires' Castle is best understood as a bourgeois-liberal perversion
and appropriation of the energy of these movements]{.underline}**.
[**The Vampires' Castle was born the moment when [the struggle not to be
defined by identitarian categories became the quest to have 'identities'
recognised by a bourgeois big Other]{.mark}.** The privilege I certainly
enjoy as a white male consists in part in my not being aware of my
ethnicity and my gender]{.underline}, and [it is a sobering and
revelatory experience to occasionally be made aware of these
blind-spots]{.underline}. [**But, rather than seeking a world in which
everyone achieves freedom from identitarian classification, the
Vampires' Castle seeks to corral people back into identi-camps, where
they are forever defined in the terms set by dominant power, crippled by
self-consciousness and isolated by a logic of solipsism which insists
that we cannot understand one another unless we belong to the same
identity group.** I've noticed a fascinating **magical inversion
projection-disavowal mechanism** whereby [**the sheer mention of class**
is]{.mark} now **automatically [treated as if that means one is trying
to downgrade the importance of race]{.mark} and gender**]{.underline}.
**[In fact, [the]{.mark} exact [opposite is the case,]{.mark} as
[the]{.mark} Vampires' [Castle uses a]{.mark}n ultimately [liberal
understanding]{.mark} of race and gender [to obfuscate]{.mark}
class]{.underline}**. [In all of the absurd and traumatic twitterstorms
about privilege]{.underline} earlier this year **[it was noticeable that
the discussion of class privilege was entirely absent]{.underline}**.
[The task]{.underline}, as ever, **[remains the articulation of class,
gender and race -- but the founding move of the Vampires' Castle is the
dis-articulation of class from other categories. The problem that the
Vampires' Castle was set up to solve is this: how do you hold immense
wealth and power while also appearing as a victim, marginal and
oppositional?]{.underline}** **[The solution was already there -- in the
Christian Church]{.underline}**. **[So the VC has recourse to all the
infernal strategies, dark pathologies and psychological torture
instruments Christianity invented,]{.underline}** and [which Nietzsche
described in The Genealogy of Morals]{.underline}. **[This priesthood of
bad conscience, this nest of pious guilt-mongers, is exactly what
Nietzsche predicted when he said that something worse than Christianity
was already on the way. Now, here it is ... The Vampires' Castle feeds
on the energy and anxieties and vulnerabilities of young students, but
most of all it lives by converting the suffering of particular groups --
the more 'marginal' the better -- into academic capital]{.underline}**.
**[The most lauded figures in the Vampires' Castle are those who have
spotted a new market in suffering]{.underline}** -- **[those who can
find a group more oppressed and subjugated than any previously exploited
will find themselves promoted through the ranks very quickly. The
[first]{.mark} law of the Vampires' Castle is: individualise and
privatise everything]{.underline}**. While **[in theory it claims to be
in favour of structural critique, in practice [it never focuses on
anything except individual behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Some of
these working class types are not terribly well brought up, and can be
very rude at times. Remember: [condemning individuals is always more
important than paying attention to impersonal structures]{.underline}.
The actual ruling class propagates ideologies of individualism, while
tending to act as a class. (Many of what we call 'conspiracies' are the
ruling class showing class solidarity.) [The VC]{.underline}, as
dupe-servants of the ruling class, does the opposite: it **[pays lip
service to 'solidarity' and 'collectivity']{.underline}**, **[while
always acting as if the individualist categories imposed by power really
hold]{.underline}**. **[Because they are petit-bourgeois to the core,
the members of the Vampires' Castle are intensely competitive, but this
is repressed in the passive aggressive manner typical of the
bourgeoisie]{.underline}**. [What holds them together is not solidarity,
but mutual fear -- the fear that they will be the next one to be outed,
exposed, condemned. **The [second]{.mark} law of the Vampires' Castle
is: [make]{.mark} thought and [action appear]{.mark} very, very
[difficult]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[There must be no lightness, and
certainly no humour. Humour isn't serious, by definition,
right]{.underline}**? **[Thought is hard work, for people with posh
voices and furrowed brows]{.underline}**. **[Where there is confidence,
introduce scepticism]{.underline}**. **[Say: don't be hasty, we have to
think more deeply about this. Remember: having convictions is
oppressive, and might lead to gulags. The [third]{.mark} law of the
Vampires' Castle is: [propagate]{.mark} as much [guilt]{.mark} as you
can]{.underline}**. **[The more guilt the better]{.underline}**.
**[People must feel bad: it is a sign that they understand the gravity
of things]{.underline}**. [It's OK to be class-privileged if you feel
guilty about privilege and make others in a subordinate class position
to you feel guilty too. You do some good works for the poor, too, right?
The [fourth]{.mark} law of the Vampires' Castle is:
**[essentialize]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[While fluidity of identity,
pluarity and multiplicity are always claimed on behalf of the VC
members]{.underline}** -- [partly to cover up their own invariably
wealthy, privileged or bourgeois-assimilationist background]{.underline}
-- **[the enemy is always to be essentialized]{.underline}**. **[Since
the desires animating the VC are in large part priests' desires to
excommunicate and condemn, there has to be a strong distinction between
Good and Evil, with the latter essentialized. Notice the
tactics]{.underline}**. [X has made a remark/ has behaved in a
particular way -- these remarks/ this behaviour might be construed as
transphobic/ sexist etc]{.underline}. **[So far, OK]{.underline}**. But
[it's the next move which is the kicker**. X then becomes defined as a
transphobe/ sexist etc. Their whole identity becomes defined by one
ill-judged remark or behavioural slip**]{.underline}. **[Once the VC has
mustered its witch-hunt, the victim (often from a working class
background, and not schooled in the passive aggressive etiquette of the
bourgeoisie) can reliably be goaded into losing their temper, further
securing their position as pariah/ latest to be consumed in feeding
frenzy. [The fifth law]{.mark} of the Vampires' Castle: think like a
liberal (because you are one).]{.underline}** **[The VC's work of
[constantly stoking up reactive outrage]{.mark} consists [of]{.mark}
endlessly pointing out [the]{.mark} screamingly [obvious]{.mark}:
capital behaves like capital (it's not very nice!), [repressive state
apparatuses are repressive]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We must protest!
Neo-anarchy in the UK [The second libidinal formation is
neo-anarchism]{.underline}. By neo-anarchists [I definitely do not mean
anarchists or syndicalists involved in actual workplace
organisation]{.underline}, such as the Solidarity Federation. **[I mean,
rather, those who identify as anarchists but whose involvement in
politics extends little beyond student protests and occupations, and
commenting on Twitter]{.underline}**. Like the denizens of the Vampires'
Castle, [neo-anarchists usually come from a petit-bourgeois background,
if not from somewhere even more class-privileged]{.underline}. They are
also overwhelmingly young: in their twenties or at most their early
thirties, and what informs the neo-anarchist position is a narrow
historical horizon. Neo-anarchists have experienced nothing but
capitalist realism. By the time the neo-anarchists had come to political
consciousness -- and many of them have come to political consciousness
remarkably recently, given the level of bullish swagger they sometimes
display -- the Labour Party had become a Blairite shell, implementing
neo-liberalism with a small dose of social justice on the side. **[But
the problem with neo-anarchism is that it unthinkingly reflects this
historical moment rather than offering any escape from
it]{.underline}**. It forgets, or perhaps is genuinely unaware of, the
Labour Party's role in nationalising major industries and utilities or
founding the National Health Service. [Neo-anarchists will assert that
'parliamentary politics never changed anything']{.underline}, or [the
'Labour Party was always useless']{.underline} while attending protests
about the NHS, or retweeting complaints about the dismantling of what
remains of the welfare state. **[[There's a strange implicit rule
here:]{.mark} [it's OK to protest]{.mark} against what
[parliament]{.mark} has done, [but it's not alright to enter into
parliament]{.mark} or the mass media to attempt to engineer change from
there]{.underline}**. [Mainstream media is to be disdained, but BBC
Question Time is to be watched and moaned about on Twitter]{.underline}.
**[[Purism shades into fatalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**; **[better not to
be in any way tainted by the corruption of the mainstream, [better to
uselessly 'resist' than]{.mark} to risk [get]{.mark}ting [your hands
dirty]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It's not surprising, then, that so many
neo-anarchists come across as depressed. This depression is no doubt
reinforced by the anxieties of postgraduate life, since, like the
Vampires' Castle, neo-anarchism has its natural home in universities,
and is usually propagated by those studying for postgraduate
qualifications, or those who have recently graduated from such study.
[**What is to be done?** Why have these two configurations come to the
fore]{.underline}? **[The first reason is that they have been allowed to
prosper by capital because they serve its interests]{.underline}**.
**[Capital subdued the organised working class by decomposing class
consciousness, viciously subjugating trade unions while seducing 'hard
working families' into identifying with their own narrowly defined
interests instead of the interests of the wider class]{.underline}**;
but [**why would capital be concerned about a 'left' that replaces class
politics with a moralising individualism, and that, far from building
solidarity, spreads fear and insecurity?** The second reason
is]{.underline} what Jodi Dean has called **[communicative
capitalism]{.underline}**. **[It might have been possible to ignore the
Vampires' Castle and the neo-anarchists if it weren't for capitalist
cyberspace]{.underline}**. **[The VC's pious moralising has been a
feature of a certain 'left' for many years]{.underline}** -- **[but, if
one wasn't a member of this particular church, its sermons could be
avoided]{.underline}**. [Social media means that this is no longer the
case, and there is little protection from the psychic pathologies
propagated by these discourses. So what can we do now]{.underline}?
**[First of all, it is imperative to reject identitarianism, and to
recognise that there are no identities, only desires, interests and
identifications]{.underline}**. [Part of the importance of the British
Cultural Studies project]{.underline} -- as revealed so powerfully and
so movingly in John Akomfrah's installation The Unfinished Conversation
(currently in Tate Britain) and his film The Stuart Hall Project --
**[was to have resisted identitarian essentialism]{.underline}**.
**[Instead of freezing people into chains of already-existing
equivalences, the point was to treat any articulation as provisional and
plastic]{.underline}**. **[New articulations can always be
created]{.underline}**. **[No-one is essentially
anything]{.underline}**. [Sadly, the right act on this insight more
effectively than the left does]{.underline}. **[The
bourgeois-identitarian left knows how to propagate guilt and conduct a
witch hunt, but it doesn't know how to make converts]{.underline}**. But
[that, after all, is not the point]{.underline}. [The aim is not to
popularise a leftist position, or to win people over to it, but to
remain in a position of elite superiority, but now with class
superiority redoubled by moral superiority too. **'How dare you talk --
it's we who speak for those who suffer!'**]{.underline} But **[[the
rejection of identitarianism can only be achieved by]{.mark} the
[re-assertion of class]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[A left that does not
have class at its core can only be a liberal pressure
group]{.underline}**. [Class consciousness is always
double]{.underline}: [it involves a simultaneous knowledge of the way in
which class frames and shapes all experience, and a knowledge of the
particular position that we occupy in the class structure]{.underline}.
**[It must be remembered that the aim of our struggle is not recognition
by the bourgeoisie, nor even the destruction of the bourgeoisie
itself]{.underline}**. **[It is the class structure]{.underline}** --
**[a structure that wounds everyone, even those who materially profit
from it]{.underline}** -- **[that must be destroyed]{.underline}**.
**[The interests of the working class are the interests of
all]{.underline}**; **[the interests of the bourgeoisie are the
interests of capital]{.underline}**, **[which are the interests of
no-one]{.underline}**. [**Our struggle must be towards the construction
of a new and surprising world, not the preservation of identities shaped
and distorted by capital.** If this seems like a forbidding and daunting
task, it is]{.underline}. But **[we can start to engage in many
prefigurative activities right now]{.underline}**. Actually, **[such
activities would go beyond pre-figuration -- they could start a virtuous
cycle, a self-fulfilling prophecy in which bourgeois modes of
subjectivity are dismantled and a new universality starts to build
itself]{.underline}**. [[We need to]{.mark} learn, or re-learn, how to
[build comradeship]{.mark} and solidarity [instead of doing capital's
work for it]{.mark} by condemning and abusing each other]{.underline}.
**[This doesn't mean]{.underline}**, of course, **[that we must always
agree]{.underline}** -- on the contrary, **[[we must create conditions
where disagreement can take place without]{.mark} fear of
[exclusion]{.mark} and excommunication]{.underline}**. [We need to think
very strategically about how to use social media]{.underline} -- [always
remembering that, despite the egalitarianism claimed for social media by
capital's libidinal engineers, that this is currently an enemy
territory, dedicated to the reproduction of capita]{.underline}l. But
**[this doesn't mean that we can't occupy the terrain and start to use
it for the purposes of producing class consciousness]{.underline}**.
**[We must break out of the 'debate' that communicative capitalism in
which capital is endlessly cajoling us to participate in, and remember
that we are involved in a class struggle]{.underline}**. **[[The goal is
not to 'be' an activist, but to aid the working class to]{.mark}
activate -- and [transform]{.mark} -- itself. Outside the Vampires'
Castle, anything is possible.]{.underline}**

#### They don't create a space of resistance -- they instead carve out a pseudo-radical space in an activity that remains funded by white elites and sustained through labor exploitation. Capitalism thrives on exactly this sort of politics -- the simulation of agency allows people to pretend there's an outside to the system. It's that rush of agency that allows us to simulate the reclamation of the subject.

Yet the [established [patterns of self-construction]{.mark},
which]{.underline} thus [have to be defended and]{.underline} further
[developed]{.underline} at any price, [[have]{.mark} fundamental
[problems]{.mark}]{.underline} attached to them: ﬁrstly, [[the attempt
to constitute]{.mark}, on the basis of]{.underline} product choices and
acts of [consumption, [a Self]{.mark} and identity]{.underline} that are
[[distinct from]{.mark} and autonomous vis-a\`-vis [the market is a
contradiction]{.mark} in terms]{.underline}. Secondly, [late-modern
society's established patterns of consumption are known to be socially
exclusive and environmentally destructive]{.underline}. Despite all
hopes for ecological modernization and revolutionary improvements in
resource efﬁciency (e.g. Weizsa¨cker et al., 1998; Hawkenet al., 1999;
Lomborg, 2001), [physical environmental limits imply that the lifestyles
and established patterns of consumption]{.underline} cherished by
advanced modern societies [cannot even be extended to all residents of
the richest countries]{.underline}, let alone to the populations of the
developing world. For the sake of the (re)construction of an ever
elusive Self, [in their struggle against
self-referentiality]{.underline} and in pursuit of the regeneration of
difference, [late-modern [societies are]{.mark}]{.underline} thus
[[locked into the imperative of maintaining]{.underline}]{.mark} and
further developing the principle of [exclusion]{.underline} (Blu¨hdorn,
2002, 2003). At any price they have to, and indeed do, defend [[a
lifestyle that requires]{.mark} **ever increasing social [inequality,
environmental degradation]{.mark}, predatory [resource wars, and]{.mark}
the tight [policing of]{.mark} potential internal and external
[enemies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.14 For this effort, [military and
surveillance technology provide ever more sophisticated and efﬁcient
means]{.underline}. Nevertheless, the principle of [exclusion is
ultimately still unsustainable, not only because of spiralling
'security' expenses but also because it]{.underline} directly
[contradicts the]{.underline} modernist [notion of the free and
autonomous individual]{.underline} that late-modern society desperately
aims to sustain. For this reason, late-modern society is confronted with
the task of having to sustain both the late-modern principle of
exclusion as well as its opposite, i.e. the modernist principle of
inclusion. Very importantly, the conﬂict between the principles of
exclusion and inclusion is not simply one between different individuals,
political actors or sections of society. Instead, it is a politically
irresolvable conﬂict that resides right within the late-modern
individual, the late-modern economy and late-modern politics. And if, as
Touraine notes, late-modern society no longer believes in nor even
desires political transcendence, the particular challenge is that the
two principles can also no longer be attributed to different dimensions
of time, i.e. the former to the present, and the latter to some future
society. Instead, late-modern society needs to represent and reproduce
itself and its opposite at the same time. If considered [within this
framework]{.underline} of this analysis, the function of Luhmann's
system of protest communication, or in the terms of this article, [the
signiﬁcance of]{.underline} late-modern societies' [discourses of
radical change becomes immediately evident]{.underline}. [At a stage
when the possibility]{.underline} and desirability [of
transcending]{.underline} the principle of [exclusion has been pulled
into]{.underline} radical [doubt but when]{.underline}, at the same
time, the principle of [[inclusion]{.mark} is vitally
important]{.underline}, **[these [discourses simulate the validity of
the latter as a social ideal]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In other words,
[latemodern society reconciles the tension between the]{.underline}
cherished but exclusive [status quo]{.underline} -- for which there is
no alternative -- [and the non-existent]{.underline} inclusive
[alternative]{.underline} -- on whose existence it depends -- **[by
means of simulation]{.underline}**. The analysis of Luhmann's work has
demonstrated how the societal self-descriptions produced by the system
of protest communication, or late-modern society's discourses of radical
change, fulﬁl this function exactly. [They are]{.underline} an
[indispensable]{.underline} function system not so much because they
help to resolve late-modern society's problems of mal-coordination, but
**[because [by performing the]{.mark} possibility of the [alternative
they help to cope with]{.mark} the fundamental problem of
[self-referentiality]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In this sense, late-modern
society's discourses of sustainability, democratic renewal, social
inclusion or global justice, to name but a few, suggest that advanced
modern society is working towards an environmentally and socially
inclusive alternative -- genuinely modern -- society, but they do not
deny the fact that the big utopia and project of late-modern society is
the reproduction and further enhancement of the status quo, i.e. the
sustainability of the principle of exclusion. Protest movements as
networks of physical actors and actions complement the purely
communicative [discourses of radical change]{.underline} in that they
bring their narrative and societal selfdescription to life. Whilst the
declarations of institutionalized mainstream politics cannot escape the
generalized suspicion that they are purely rhetorical, social movements
[provide an **arena for**]{.underline} the physical expression and
[experience of the **authenticity and reality of the
alternative**,]{.underline} or at least of the reality of its
possibility and the authenticity of the commitment to its realization.
For late-modern individuals who seek to find their elusive identity in
ever new acts of consumption, protest movements offer [[an opportunity
to experience themselves as autonomous]{.mark}, as subjects, as actors,
as distinct from and opposed to the all-embracing market]{.underline}.
[Social movements and the more or less institutionalized discourses of
radical change]{.underline} thus [[transmute]{.mark}]{.underline} from
germ cells of the alternative society [[into reserves]{.mark} of
alterity, or **[theme-parks for simulated
alterity]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Blu¨hdorn, 2005a). This interpretation
reflects Luhmann's suggestion that contemporary discourses of radical
change are not so much about the actual implementation of radical social
change as about the 'symbolism of the alternative'. And it nowappears
that the [societal self-descriptions]{.underline} they [generate fulfil
a vital function]{.underline} not in so far as they increase the
reflexivity of late-modern society but [in so far as they are arenas for
the experience of simulated subjectivity, duality and
modernity]{.underline}. [They provide an opportunity to reconcile the
cherished]{.underline} but exclusive [status quo with the]{.underline}
equally cherished but [unsustainable belief in the inclusive
alternative]{.underline}. Protest movements and **[[discourses of
radical change are the implantation of the alternative into the system
itself]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or the simulated reproduction of alterity
fromthe system's own resources. [As the real alternatives]{.underline}
to the system [are utterly unattractive,]{.underline} disappearing fast,
and indeed resisted and annihilated at any price, [this internal
simulation]{.underline} of alterity [is]{.underline} becoming
[late-modern society's only remaining way of coping with the threat of
self-referentiality.]{.underline}

#### Vote negative to embrace the academic position of comrade against capitalist planetary devastation -- that requires a politics of solidarity and mass struggle that the affirmative theorizing precludes

**Dean interviewed by Alvarez 19** \-- Maximillian Alvarez is an
associate editor at The Chronicle Review. Jodi Dean, a professor of
political science at Hobart and William Smith. (\"The Comradely
Professor,\" Chronicle of Higher Education,

For Jodi Dean, a professor of political science at Hobart and William
Smith, [the word "[comrade]{.mark}" is by no means a simple
descriptor]{.underline}, nor is it some dusty relic of the bygone days
of actually-existing state socialism[. It **[is a perennial call to
action]{.mark}**, a challenge [to accept one's responsibility
toward]{.mark} others who are "on the same side of a [political
stru]{.mark}ggle." [In her new book, Comrade: An Essay on Political
Belonging](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3060-comrade) (Verso), Dean
argues that we are living in an era where **[the battle lines of a
world-historical struggle]{.mark}** --- a struggle [against planetary
destruction, forever war]{.mark}, rising [fascism]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
[a global return to
[feudalism]{.mark}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGq3hdWEe10) ---
[have already been drawn]{.mark}. And **[neutrality is not an
option]{.mark}. Everyone must answer the questions: [Which side are you
on]{.mark}? And [what are you going to do about
it?]{.mark}**]{.underline} This, according to Dean, is [why [it's
imperative to examine the]{.mark} figure of the [comrade]{.mark}, and
[to]{.mark} [eschew]{.mark} concepts of [identity and]{.mark} political
[organization]{.mark} [that leave no room for collective
struggle]{.mark}]{.underline}. To be and be called a comrade is to know
where you stand and whom you stand with. It is to recognize that we all
need to be clear about what we're fighting for --- and what we're
fighting against. As a scholar and a political organizer herself, Dean
takes this responsibility seriously. She spoke with The Chronicle Review
about the relationship between political and scholarly work, what it
means to be a communist professor today, and [what [academics]{.mark}
could be --- as researchers, teachers, colleagues, and even public
servants --- if they **[took comradeliness as their primary
directive.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Was there something about our
political moment, or the arc of your own scholarship, that made you feel
that a political theory of "comrade" needed to be worked out? Oh god,
yes. It comes out of contemporary politics, out of a [concern with the
ways that [liberal assumptions of individuality]{.mark}
[undercut]{.mark} left [concerns with collectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In [the vague, inchoate contemporary left of social media, university
campuses, NGOs, and socially engaged art, [appeals to]{.mark} individual
[identity]{.mark}, endeavors to protect individual identity, and
vigilance against suspected threats to]{.underline} individual
**[[identity displace efforts to build
collectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. My goal with Comrade is reminding
leftists of [[another]{.mark} figure of [politics]{.mark}, one that was
prominent in the 20th century as a figure for all [united in
emancipatory egalitarian struggle]{.mark} against [racism, sexism,
capitalism, and imperialism.]{.mark}]{.underline} \"My political and
scholarly work are deeply interconnected. They inform each other. Each
is better because of the other." [So I have a detailed critique of [the
figure of the ally]{.mark} and the [politics of
allyship](http://www.guidetoallyship.com/)]{.underline}. It's strange,
isn't it, that a name associated with sovereign nation states pulling
together to protect their own sovereignty, secure their own borders, has
become so ubiquitous in sectors that understand themselves as on the
left? But this effort to secure borders is the clue to the limits of
allyship: Individuals are imagined as like little sovereign states,
defending their territory and only joining together under the most
cautious and self-interested terms. Those taken to share an identity are
presumed to share a politics, as if the identity were obvious and the
politics didn't need to be built. Should academics see themselves as
comrades? It's hard. And it's hard because it indexes a real antagonism
in the academy between the university as a workplace and academia as a
collection of scholarly practices and intellectual ideals. The [relation
between [comrades]{.mark} is political; comrades [are]{.mark} those
**[on the same side of a political struggle]{.mark}**. In the socialist
and communist tradition, this struggle has been understood as a struggle
[between t]{.mark}he oppressed and the op]{.underline}pressors,
**[[proletariat and bourgeoisie]{.underline}]{.mark}**, tenant and
landlord, oppressed nations and imperialist powers, etc. Were academics
to see ourselves as comrades, we would need to see ourselves on the same
political side against, say, austerity-oriented, tax-cutting state
governments and neoliberal, financialized, corporate-minded boards of
trustees. And this might not always prioritize teaching and research ---
both of which involve enormous amounts of unpaid labor. Adjuncts and
faculty in nontenurable lines carry by far the bulk of this burden. But
many in even nominally secure positions are experiencing intensifying
precarity, and yet made to think that fighting for better conditions is
wrong or suspect because it hurts the students or delays valuable
research. From another angle, we can say that [[universities are already
sites of intense politicization]{.underline}]{.mark}, whether one thinks
of, [**[say, the role of [Chicago school
economists](https://slate.com/business/2016/01/in-chicago-boys-the-story-of-chilean-economists-who-studied-in-america-and-then-remade-their-country.html)]{.mark}**
in undermining social democracy and ushering in an era of intensifying
inequality [or]{.mark} in terms of [the various]{.mark} sorts of
"[studies]{.mark}" (gender studies, ethnic studies, Africana studies,
indigenous studies, etc.)]{.underline} fighting to redress the biases of
the centuries of scholarly production that buttress forms of
discrimination, oppression, exploitation, apartheid, and genocide. [But
this intense politicization doesn't point to researchers and teachers in
general as comrades. [It points to the]{.mark} way that researchers and
teachers may find comrades or build [comradely relations in the
struggles]{.mark} in which they participate]{.underline}. When people
think "comrade," their minds are probably conjuring some Cold-War image
of ushanka-wearing Soviets. So, what does the term "comrade" mean, and
what does it mean to consider yourself a comrade to others?
Etymologically, comrade derives from camera, the Latin word for room,
chamber, and vault. The generic function of a vault is producing a space
and holding it open. This lets us home in on the meaning of comrad**[e:
Sharing a room, sharing a space generates a closeness, an intensity of
feeling and expectation of solidarity that differentiates those on one
side from those on the other]{.underline}**. Politically, [[comradeship
is a relation of supported]{.mark} cover, that is, the expectation of
[solidarity that those on the same side have of each
other]{.mark}]{.underline}. Comrade, then, [is a mode of address, figure
of political belonging, and [carrier of expectations for action]{.mark}.
When we call ourselves comrades, we are saying that we are on the same
side, **[united around a common political
purpose]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Many within and outside academe call you
a comrade. Do you feel like there's a clear distinction between your
political and scholarly work? Maybe we could say that my political and
scholarly work are deeply interconnected. They inform each other. Each
is better because of the other. I am a better political theorist than I
was before I was engaged seriously in organized political struggle
because I now think more about audience and addressee, about the
collectivities that might engage or respond to my ideas, about the forms
of political action and belonging that my ideas presuppose. Who are they
for? Why? ["To be a communist professor today **means to try to find and
forward revolutionary optimism** in a setting of climate
catastrophe."]{.underline} The comradely scholar is committed, fierce,
and resolutely partisan. That means that she is more likely to be hated
than loved in the academy. Her commitments are political, not
disciplinary or professional commitments, which of course does not mean
that she is undisciplined or unprofessional. Think of Angela Davis.
Ronald Reagan, as governor of California, tried to prevent her from
being able to teach in the state's university system because she was a
Communist. Is there a difference between a "public scholar" and a
"comradely scholar"? Public scholars are rewarded by the same U.S.
academic system that demonizes communists as traitors, cogs, and
automatons, that blocks and dismisses them from academic jobs ...
comradely scholars, not so much. In the grand scheme of things, we're
not that far removed from the days when people were silenced, hunted,
and purged en masse from academe for being communists (or for just being
accused of communist sympathies). What does it mean to be a communist
professor today? Over the past few years a number of brilliant scholars
have been hounded out of the academy because of their political
convictions, their commitments to struggles for Palestinian rights and
against white supremacy. At the same time, cowardly administrations
repeat right-wing talking points about free speech. It's indicative of
this capitalist, upside-down world that tells us that corporations are
people but people are disposable, that we live in a knowledge society
but facts, learning, and education are simultaneously devalued and
commodified, that success brings freedom when in fact it brings debt and
entrapment in the service of the capital accumulation of the very rich.
**[[To be a communist]{.underline}]{.mark}** professor today [[means to
try to find and forward revolutionary optimism]{.underline}]{.mark} in a
setting of climate catastrophe. **[[The source of this optimism is
comradeship.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### We can't do both

**Naschek 18** \[Melissa Naschek is a co-chair of the Philadelphia
chapter of Democratic Socialists of America, "The Identity Mistake,"
Jacobin, August 2018,

**[[We Can't "Do Both]{.underline}]{.mark}**" Today, [with]{.underline}
the popularity of Bernie [[Sanders and]{.mark} a resurgence
in]{.underline} trade [[union activity]{.underline}]{.mark},
[circumstances [are]{.mark} finally [re-emerging]{.mark} for a political
program capable of fostering [mass working-class
solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, Haider would have us turn to
[[the model that has failed the working class for years: rhetorically
accepting identity]{.underline}]{.mark}-based particularism [[at the
implicit expense of class]{.underline}]{.mark}-based
[[universalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Of course, Haider does not overtly
suggest that this is an either/or. Instead, he insists that we must do
both --- working-class politics and identity politics. But "**[[doing
both]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[is easier said than
done]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Identity]{.underline}]{.mark} politics
[[and class politics understand capitalist]{.underline}]{.mark} power
[[structures in distinct ways and]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [[lead
to distinct political strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}. More importantly,
however, "**[[doing both]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[misreads the balance
of power]{.underline}]{.mark} in America today: institutionally [[on the
Left]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[we have nothing but a fraction of
the]{.underline}]{.mark} already miniscule [[labor movement to
back]{.underline}]{.mark} [[our platform and]{.underline}]{.mark} our
[[analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[But liberalism has a
major]{.underline}]{.mark}** political **[[party]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[the media]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[academia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.mark} the]{.underline}
entire world of [[nonprofits]{.underline}]{.mark}, which today controls
about as much wealth as the Church did before the French Revolution. And
[[it's in the "do both"]{.underline}]{.mark} strategy [[that
these]{.underline}]{.mark} powerful enemies of the Left (and [[allies of
capital]{.underline}]{.mark}) [worm their way into our coalition and
play up identity to [reshape working-class demands until]{.mark} they're
[neutralized]{.mark}.]{.underline} Haider fails to recognize the
profound asymmetry between the power of institutions of the
working-class and the advocates of universal class-based reforms, and
those of the liberal establishment and their own embrace of
identity-based particularism. Concretely, this asymmetry does not lead
to the best of identity politics and the best of universal demands in
some sort of synthesis. Instead, the lopsided advocacy for particularist
demands serves only to further marginalize the universalist demands. An
[[anticapitalist politics]{.underline}]{.mark} capable of fighting
against such forces [[must appeal to the whole working
class]{.underline}]{.mark} to build a mass movement.
[[Masses]{.underline}]{.mark} of people [[become interested in politics
when]{.underline}]{.mark} [[organizations offer a real possibility to
change]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[lives]{.underline}]{.mark} for the
better. **[[The only way to forge a movement]{.underline}]{.mark}**
capable of achieving that **[[is by fighting for
shared]{.underline}]{.mark}** working-class **[[political and economic
interests]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[This remains the only plausible path
to harnessing]{.underline}]{.mark} the only [[power]{.underline}]{.mark}
offered to workers in society: their position as **[[an exploited
majority]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The good news is that the needs for
affordable medical care, a livable planet, quality education, and
respect and security in the workplace satisfy such a mandate. It is two
of Mistaken Identity's supposed interlocutors, Barbara J. Fields and
Karen Fields, who note that downplaying class demands "is a devastating,
intolerable mistake. It leads people to say that race is fundamental ---
not economics, not class --- and if you bring class in then you're
trying to deny the reality of human existence and identity. That is the
big mystification achieved by racecraft." While Haider rightly
identifies the ineptitude of identity politics, he does not craft a
political strategy that could serve as the basis for a socialist
politics. Ultimately, Mistaken Identity is a manifesto of the Zombie New
Left, claiming to overcome identity politics but leading us down the
same dead end.

#### [They don't get one]{.underline}. Perm doesn't mean "vote aff 'cause you didn't impact turn every 1AC claim" -- it's shorthand for a test of opportunity cost between political actions, and this round already discarded that model. It's reciprocal to the strategic advantage given to affs that leverage offense from something other than the plan text. Their is metaphorical and aspirational \-\-- any decent 2A could semantically morph their 2-paragraph solvency advocate into agreeing with nearly any specific, detailed, or well-worked advocacy of any sort. Quality debate on difficult questions about how to approach a violent world requires a meaningful role for the negative \-\-- otherwise we're just tilting at windmills and training to become sophists. But, even if we lose the perm, kick the alt and vote for a residual link since it doesn't prove their advantages outweigh our links. 

#### [No sandbagging]{.underline}. If there's another theory of competition that justifies something like a perm, the 1AR is [too late]{.underline} to establish it---we can only base research on our limited knowledge of the 1AC, so [holding them to it]{.underline} is key to prevent aff condo and opportunistic reframing.

#### Even if they get perms, you should assess any link we win to a 1ac argument as severance, which is a reason to reject the ground on the fairness grounds above, and also on substantive grounds: allowing the aff to morph by becoming the alt is actively hostility to debate -- their ability to forego position-taking is a common post-political ploy that serves as a proxy for substantive engagement and makes both the aff and perm counter-productive

Unlike that of some earlier critics of academic theory, [my
position]{.underline}, first off, [is entirely from within]{.underline}.
Theory is what I professionally teach and write about, and I came of age
in precisely the years when it rose to prominence in the university. I
am not against theory, only the monopolization of the term by a narrow
lineage within it that drew on ideas from the interwar German
philosophical Right which were later picked up and modified by
posthumanist intellectuals in France after World War II before being
imported into the United States and Britain in the 1970s. [My view is
not that theory should abandon its demanding lexicon and obscure
phrasings to \"get down\" with larger audiences]{.underline}, or that it
should make itself colloquial by returning to the models of the public
intellectual. For [the problem with the theory that
predominates]{.underline} today in the humanities [is not that it is
obscure but that it is **formulaic** and **conventional**]{.underline}.
The problem with theory is not that it is too theoretical rather than
praxis oriented but that it is not theoretical enough. [Its
philosophical bases operate without reference to intellectual
history]{.underline}---the understanding of not only what a writer is
saying but what tradition they are adopting by saying it---in short,
[the preconditions of knowing and speaking understood in terms of
conceptual]{.underline} \[End Page 66\] [leads]{.underline}, the
ramifications of context, [and intellectual debts.]{.underline} This
would lead to a certain dialectical understanding of the complexity of
theory. For example, one learns much more about what the revisions of
Hegel mean in a book of intellectual history like political theorist
Shadia Drury\'s study of Alexandre Kojève, for example, than in the far
more philosophically adept work of Judith Butler on the French
receptions of Hegel. The former is for that reason, I would argue, a
more profound work---and certainly a more enabling one. Tedesco Okay,
you declare that theory\'s had an impact publicly and that the impact
has been negative. Like what? Brennan **[A lot of humanities [theory in
practice is characterized by hostility to debate]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[[The theorist mixes]{.underline}]{.mark} a phatic mode of address with
a tendency to reconfigure incompatible [[ideas in a new amalgam that
they]{.underline}]{.mark} then [[present as]{.mark} a new ideological
\"[pluralism]{.mark}.\" [The whole mode]{.mark} of thought [is]{.mark}
one of **[deliberate circularity]{.mark}**]{.underline}---that is, [[the
rhetorical gesture that suggests]{.mark} that philosophical [depth is
achieved when one acknowledges]{.mark} that [what they are]{.mark} in
the act of **[saying is really not being said]{.mark}** and that any
attempt at establishing a position must always be undercut by the mode
of utterance that announces it[, the impossibility of achieving an
en]{.mark}]{.underline}d. The habit these days is not to say that you
oppose a position but that you want to \"put pressure\" on it, that you
are not disagreeing with your interlocutor but \"thinking with\" them,
and so on. This does not mean, of course, that harsh rejections and
emphatic hostilities are not taking place, only that they are reserved
for subrosa commentary or corridor talk. It has, at any rate, become a
conceit, a sign of one\'s sophistication[[, to **forgo the taking of a
position**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the very act of giving a reading,
[[one is likely now to **suspend interpretation** on the grounds that it
would **foreclose alternative possibilities**]{.underline}]{.mark}. One
speaks of dialectics today, for example, as a perpetually unresolved
process, an open-ended, essentially self-canceling gesture, although
this is not at all what dialectics means in Hegel. One would actually
have to work through Hegel to know that, but few do. **[[These are
post-political stances]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [which is one of the more
salient ways in which [theory folds itself into]{.mark} a current public
[debate]{.mark}]{.underline} [(**[without having to
debate]{.underline}**]{.mark} and pretending it is beyond the taking of
positions) and why it is given space in the public. I am saying that
[[the]{.underline} [post-political outlook]{.underline}]{.mark} is
within the theory that sees itself as left and that dissidence in that
milieu [[takes its current shape from **reactionary
ideas**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[End Page 67\] derived from the European
interwar era: [above all, the antihumanist]{.underline} (and posthuman)
[concoctions]{.underline} of various sorts in [the work of the inter-war
turn to ontology]{.underline} and immanence [in]{.underline} Georges
**[Bataille]{.underline}**, Kojève, and others and then, after World War
II, by Hyppolite and others, who are the immediate predecessors of
Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, and Jacques Derrida. The invention of
the posthuman in all its variations (death of the author, history
without a subject, the de-transcendentalizing of \"Man,\" and so on) was
devised in the 1930s by the bohemian and antinomian right wing of
Europe, precisely to make the credible gains in the name of the human
(dignity, equality, universal rights) by the organized Left of those
years appear nugatory. [This kind of post-politics operates according to
a different logic from that of the ideologues of today\'s globalization
and takes its leads from the \"revolutionary\" rhetoric]{.underline} of
figures like Ernst Troeltsch, Moeller van der Bruck, Martin Heidegger,
and postwar figures like Maurice Blanchot.
**[[Post-politics]{.underline}]{.mark}** of this sort [[does not pose
itself as]{.mark} a [transcendence]{.mark} of politics [but]{.mark} as
its [**realization on a higher plane**; it does not embrace]{.mark} the
idea of [getting beyond politics]{.mark} or abjuring it [but the
opposite]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[insisting on its
all-encompassing]{.mark} and productive [character]{.mark}, which is to
say **[effacing the distinction between doing politics and
breathing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Theory]{.underline}, of course, is
not itself right wing; it is rather liberal. Nevertheless, it hates the
Left with an intensity that only liberals can have, and so it [gives us
a conception of politics as an untranscendable void in which action is
canceled out as symptom and in which **[ethics steps in to play the role
of a proxy for politics.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Perhaps predictably,
[[such]{.mark} an autotelic understanding of theory [has produced a

philosophically inclined commentators like Naomi Klein, Serge Halimi, or
Thomas Frank. I take this to be an imperial problem---that is, the
product of a metropolitan outlook of citizen-spectators living under the
obligatory distractions of the entertainment state, which is more and
more characterized by a culture of compulsory television watching. [It
is the problem, we might say, of the global spread of a metropolitan

**Young 6** \[Iris Marion, was Professor of Political Science at the
University of Chicago, "Responsibility and Global Justice"\]

Some moral theorists argue that responsibility names a form of obli-
gationdistinctfromduty.JoelFeinberg,forexample,distinguishesbetween an
ethic that focuses on obligation or duty and an ethic that focuses on
responsibility. On the one hand, a duty specifies a rule of action or
delin- eates the substance of what actions count as performing the duty.
[A responsibility]{.underline}, on the other hand, [while no less
obligatory, is more open with regard to what counts as carrying it
out.]{.underline}49 A person with responsibilities is obliged to attend
to outcomes that the responsibilities call for, and to orient her
actions in ways demonstrably intended to contribute to bringing about
those outcomes. Because a person may face many moral demands on her
actions, and because changes in circumstances are often unpredictable,
just how a person goes about discharging her responsibilities is a
matter subject to considerable discretion.5° [Given that **[a
combination of responsibilities may be overly
demanding]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and given that agents have discretion
in how they choose to discharge their responsibilities, [it is
reasonable to say that it is up to each agent to decide what she can and
should do under the circumstances, and how she should order her moral
priorities.]{.underline} Others have the right to question and criticize
our decisions and actions, however, especially when we depend on one
another to perform effective collective action. [[Part of what it means
to be responsible on the social connection model is to
be]{.underline}]{.mark} accountable to others with whom one shares
responsibility---**[[accountable for what one has decided to
do]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and **for which structural injustices one
has chosen to address**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [When an agent is able to
give an account of what she has done,]{.underline} and why, in terms of
shared responsibilities for structural injustice, then [others usually
ought to accept her decision and the way she sets priorities for her
actions]{.underline}.

These considerations begin to provide an answer to the question I stated
above, namel how should one reason about the best way to use one's
limited time and resources to respond to structural injustices? In a
world with many and deep structural injustices[, [most of us]{.mark}, in
principle, [share more responsibility **than we can**
]{.mark}**reasonably [be expected to discharge]{.mark}.**]{.underline}5'
Thus, [**[we must make choices]{.mark}** [about where our action can be
most useful or which injustices we regard as most
urgent]{.mark}.]{.underline} While a social connection model of
responsibility will not give us a list of maxims or imperatives, it
should offer some parameters for reasoning to guide our decisions and
actions. These parameters, in turn, address the other ques tion I raised
earlier---the question about kinds and degrees of responsi bility.
Different agents plausibly have different kinds of responsibilities in
relation to particular issues of justice, and some arguably have a
greater degree of responsibility than others.

### 2nc turns case

#### Group the solvency / role of the ballot debate 

#### If we win a single link, it means that the aff is psychoanalytically trapped in a cycle of failure -- leftist academics who focus inward on studies and projects that don't direct themselves towards communist revolution know internally that they've sold out the proletariat, because they'll benefit continuously from academic rewards without pushing those back towards the hopes of political change -- they then displace their guilt with the same type of incessant micropolitical activity over and over again. Dean, Burghum, and Alvarez explain this through the psychoanalytic phenomenon of drive -- the reason so many self-described radicals waste their time in hapless protests, in academic life, or in places like debate is that they ENJOY failing, and come to enjoy the PROCESSES of politics without structuring their enjoyment around the GOAL

#### This psychoanalytic phenomenon couldn't describe the aff better -- their depictions of impacts utterly detached from any theoretical apparatus capable of challenging them aren't meant to change things, but simply marketed and sold to the judge, sustaining an endless loop of debate and ballot, whereby the process replaces any goal -- they do this because it's ENJOYABLE, because debate is fun -- but that just means capitalism has won

[Is Brown right]{.underline}? [Having diagnosed left
immobility]{.underline} and self-loathing [as melancholic,
does]{.underline} [she correctly identify what was **lost** and what is
**retained**]{.underline}, [what is displaced and what is
disavowed]{.underline}? And does her account of melancholia as a
structure of desire exhaust the potential of her move to Freud or might
additional elements of his analysis also prove helpful for coming to
grips with the left and the force of loss?
[[Benjamin's]{.underline}]{.mark} own [[account]{.mark} of left-wing
melancholy [suggests]{.mark} a loss of a different sort]{.underline}
than Brown's---[[the **betrayal of**]{.mark} **revolutionary
ideals**]{.underline}, [of [the **proletariat**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[He criticizes]{.underline}]{.mark} Kästner and other [new objectivists
not only for [clinging to a form marked by the **depiction of the
brutalities of**]{.mark} **[everyday life]{.mark}** but for
[commodifying this form]{.mark}]{.underline}, [for [packaging up the
**traces**]{.mark} of **spiritual goods** [as]{.mark} so much
[commercial content to be **marketed and sold** to the
bourgeoisie]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Benjamin argues in "The Author as
Producer," however revolutionary the political tendency associated with
the "new objectivity" may appear, "it actually functions in a
counterrevolutionary manner as long as the writer experiences his
solidarity with the proletariat ideologically and not as a producer"
(3). Attached to an ideological experience of solidarity, the left
melancholic disavows his practice, the practical effect of his
journalistic activities. What Brown construes as a real loss of
socialist ideals for which the left compensates via an obstinate and
narcissistic attachment, [Benjamin presents]{.underline} as [compromise
and betrayal]{.underline}, a compromise and betrayal [that ideological
identification with the proletariat **attempts to
displace.**]{.underline} Brown suggests a left defeat and left behind in
the wake of historical changes. [Benjamin compels us to [consider a
**left that gave in**, **sold out**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Freud's
gesture to the melancholic's loss of self-respect points in a similar
direction. To be sure, he isn't explicit here. His discussion evades,
somewhat, the reason for the loss of self-respect (to which I said I
would return). Nonetheless, the example he takes from the clinic hints
at why the subject loses self-respect. Describing a woman who "loudly
pities her husband for being tied to such an incapable wife," Freud
observes that she is really accusing her husband of incapacity. Her
self-reproaches, some of which are genuine, "are allowed to obtrude
themselves, since they help to mask the others and make recognition of
the true state of affairs impossible." Moreover, these reproaches
"derive from the pros and cons of the conflict of love that has led to
the loss of love" (247). Might it not be the case, then, that the woman
is quite rightly recognizing her own incapacity in finding a capable
husband, one capable of sustaining her desire? Might she not be
punishing herself for compromising, for making due, for allowing the
pros and cons of the conflict of love to constrain her desire as she
acquiesces to a reality of acceptance and moderation to which there
seems to be no alternative? If the answer to these questions is yes,
then the woman's loss of self-respect is an indication of the guilt she
feels at having ceded her desire. To use the terms given to us by Lacan,
"the only thing one can be guilty of is giving ground relative to one's
desire." The woman's identification with her husband is a compromise,
the way she sublimates her desire so as to make him the object of it.
The ferocity of her super-ego and the unrelenting punishment to which it
subjects her indicates that she has given up on the impossibility of
desire, desire's own constitutive dissatisfaction, to accommodate
herself to everyday life. Freud notes the delight super-ego takes in
torment as well as the fact that the subject enjoys it: If the love for
the object---a love which cannot be given up though the object itself is
given up---takes refuge in narcissistic identification, then the hate
comes into operation on this substitutive object, abusing it, debasing
it, making it suffer and deriving sadistic satisfaction from its
suffering. The self-tormenting in melancholia, which is without doubt
enjoyable, signifies, just like the corresponding phenomenon in
obsessional neurosis, a satisfaction of trends of sadism and hate which
relate to an object, and which have been turned round upon the
subject\'s own self . . . (250). His analysis here uses the terminology
of the drives set out in "Instincts and Their Vicissitudes." In that
essay, Freud says that the drives, lamentably translated as instincts in
the Strachey edition of his papers, undergo the following vicissitudes:
reversal into their opposite, turning round upon the subject's own self,
repression, and sublimation. As Lacan makes clear, what is crucial in
the Freudian account of the drives is the way drive provides the subject
with another way to enjoy. The enjoyment, jouissance, that desire can't
attain, drive can't avoid. Unable to satisfy or maintain desire, the
subject enjoys in another way, the way of the drive. [[If desire
is]{.mark} always a desire to desire]{.underline}, [[a desire that can
**never be filled**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [a desire for [a
**jouissance**]{.mark} or enjoyment [that can **never be
attained**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [**drive** functions as a way to
**enjoy through failure**. In **drive**, one doesn't have to reach the
goal to enjoy]{.underline}. [The activities]{.underline}]{.mark} [one
undertakes to achieve a goal **[become satisfying own their
own]{.mark}**. Because they provide a little kick of enjoyment, they
come themselves to take the place of the goal.]{.underline} Attaching to
the process, **[[enjoyment captures the subject]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Further, as Slavoj Zizek argues, the shift from desire to drive effects
a change in the status of the object. Whereas the object of desire is
originally lost, "which emerges as lost," in drive loss itself is an
object. In other words, [[drive isn't a quest for a lost
object]{.underline}]{.mark}; it's the enactment of loss or the force
loss exerts on the field of desire. So [drives don't circulate around a
space that was once occupied by an ideal, impossible
objec]{.underline}t. Rather, [[**drive is the sublimation of desire** as
it turns back in on itself,]{.mark} this turning thereby [**producing
the loop of drive** and providing its own **special
charge**]{.mark}]{.underline}. An emphasis on the drive dimension of
melancholia, on Freud's attention to the way sadism in [melancholia is
"turned round upon the subject's own self,"]{.underline} leads to an
interpretation of the general contours shaping the left that differs
from Brown's[. [Instead of a left attached to]{.mark} an
**unacknowledged [orthodoxy]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [we have
one]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that has **given way on the desire for
communism**]{.underline}, [betrayed its]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[historical [commitment to the proletariat]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
[and sublimated **revolutionary energies** into]{.underline}]{.mark}
[restorationist [practices that **strengthen the hold of the
capitalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This left has replaced]{.mark}
[commitments to]{.mark}]{.underline} the emancipatory, [[egalitarian
struggles]{.mark} of working people against capitalism]{.underline},
commitments that were never fully orthodox, but always ruptured,
conflicted, and contested, **[[with incessant]{.mark}
[activity]{.mark}]{.underline}** (not unlike the mania Freud also
associates with melancholia) and so now satisfies itself [[with
**criticism**]{.mark} [and **interpretation**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[**[small projects]{.underline}** and **[local
actions]{.underline}**]{.mark}, particular issues and legislative
victories, art, technology, [**[procedures]{.underline}**, [and
**process**]{.underline}]{.mark}[. [It sublimates **revolutionary
desire** to **democratic drive**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[to the
repetitious practices]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[offered up as
democracy]{.underline}** (whether representative, deliberative, or
radical), [having **already [conceded to the inevitably of
capitalism]{.mark}**,]{.underline} "noticeably abandoning any striking
power against the big bourgeoisie," to return to Benjamin's language.
[For such a left [enjoyment comes from its **withdrawal from power and
responsibility**]{.mark}, its sublimation of goals and responsibilities
[into]{.mark} the branching, fragmented practices of
[**micro-politics**,]{.mark} [**self-care**, and **issue
awareness**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[Perpetually
slighted]{.underline}**, harmed, and undone, [[this left remains]{.mark}
**[stuck in repetition]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [unable to break
out]{.underline}]{.mark} [of the circuits [of drive]{.mark} in which it
is caught, unable **[because it enjoys]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### That means it's try or die for orienting our politics towards the Communist horizon -- even if their politics would be good in the abstract, they'll never be actualized because of their entrapment within the repetitive cycle of drive -- Communist desire is the ONLY psychoanalytic structure capable of breaking through drive's endless cycling, through tapping into a common will that provides COLLETIVE desire, such that our politics can be communally redirected towards an egalitarian ends

### 1nc link -- structural claims

#### The AFF's structural claims and refusal of institutional politics results in a politics of cynicism that makes any kind of material change impossible

**Burgum 15** (Samuel, PhD candidate in Sociology at the University of
Warwick and has been conducting research with Occupy London since 2012,
"The branding of the left: between spectacle and passivity in an era of
cynicism," *Journal for Cultural Research*, Volume 19, Issue 3)

[Rather than the Situationist spectacle]{.underline}, then, I argue that
**[[the reason]{.underline}]{.mark}** those on [[**the left are
rendered** post-politically **impotent**]{.mark} to bring about change
**[is not because we are deceived, but because we enact apathy despite
ourselves.]{.mark}**]{.underline} In other words, the relationship
between the resistive subject and ideology is not one of false
consciousness, but one of cynicism: [[we are]{.mark} not misdirected by
shallow spectacles, but instead somehow [distracted by our cynical
belief that we are being "distracted"]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this
section, I begin by outlining the concept of cynicism as it has been
theorised by Peter Sloterdijk and Slavoj Žižek. This then leads us to an
analysis of the cynical position adopted by Brand's critics, which I
argue actually demonstrates more political problems on the part of the
left than those suggested by Brand himself. For Sloterdijk, cynicism is
an attitude that emerges right at the centre of the enlightenment
project, where, in contrast to a modernist illumination of truth, "a
twilight arises, a deep ambivalence" (1987, p. 22). Rather than the
promised heightened consciousness of science that would allow us to see
the hidden essential truths behind appearances, the very conception of
truth as unconcealedness (aletheia)3 instead creates a widespread
mistrust and suspicion of every appearance. Subsequently, ["a new form
of realism bursts forth]{.underline}, a form that is [driven by the fear
of becoming deceived or overpowered]{.underline} ... [everything that
appears to us could be a deceptive manoeuvre of an overpowering evil
enemy"]{.underline} (Sloterdijk, 1987, p. 330). The surface becomes
suspect and the subject therefore retreats from all appearances: judging
them to be spectacles that are seeking to oppress through falsity. The
result is cynicism. Subsequently, [this leads]{.underline} Sloterdijk
[to]{.underline} his well-known paradoxical definition of [cynicism as
"enlightened false consciousness"]{.underline} which he describes as [a
"modernized, unhappy consciousness on which enlightenment has laboured
both successfully and in vain ... it has learned its lessons in
enlightenment, but it has not, probably was not able to, put them into
practice"]{.underline} (1987, p. 5). In other words, **[[in the search
for a higher consciousness behind appearances]{.mark}, the subject
[is]{.mark} paradoxically ["duped" by their very suspicion of being
duped.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Furthermore, **[[because the subject
thinks they "know" that appearances are just a mask, they
disbelieve]{.mark} the truth when it does appear.]{.underline}** Like
the story of the Emperor's New Clothes, [they fancy themselves to know
what is right in front of their eyes (that the emperor is nude and
vulnerable) yet they choose "not to know" and don't act upon
it]{.underline} (they still act as if the emperor is all-powerful). As
such, cynical reason is no longer naïve, but is a paradox of enlightened
false consciousness: one knows the falsehood very well, [one is well
aware of a particular hidden interest hidden behind the ideological
universality, but still one does not renounce it.]{.underline} (Žižek,
1989, p. 23) [The audience to the parade of power can see that the
emperor is not divine]{.underline} -- just a fragile human body like the
rest of us -- yet they cynically choose not to know and objectively
retain his aura. **[[They congratulate themselves on "knowing"]{.mark}
that Brand is [a trivial spectacle, yet they choose to remain
apathetic]{.mark} towards his [calls for action.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
As such, [the dismissive reaction to Brand **reveals a regressive
interpassive tendency of the left to subjectively treat ourselves as
"enlightened" to authentic politics and yet objectively render ourselves
passive.** In a kind of defence mechanism, the left believes that it can
avoid becoming the dupe of the latest fashion or advertising trend by
treating everything as]{.underline} a matter of [fashion and
advertising, **reassuring ourselves** as we flip through television
channels]{.underline} or browse through the shopping mall [that **at
least we know what's really going on.**]{.underline} (Stanley, 2007, p.
399) [The critics disbelieve Brand, distrusting his motives and seeing
him as inauthentic, yet they continue to "believe" objectively in their
own marginalisation.]{.underline} As such, **[[the cynical left believe
they are dismissing]{.mark} shallow [spectacle in the direction of
a]{.mark} stronger [authentic radicalism, yet]{.mark} what
[their]{.mark} "[doing]{.mark} believes" [is the maintenance of their
apathetic position]{.mark}.]{.underline}** More precisely, [**[it
maintains the attitudes of left melancholy and anti-populism.]{.mark}**
The problem of ["left melancholy" points towards the forever-delayed
search for authenticity]{.mark}]{.underline} on the part of a cynical
left that is in mourning. Coined by Walter Benjamin (1998), [the concept
points towards "the revolutionary who is]{.underline}, finally,
[attached more to a particular political analysis or ideal]{.underline}
-- even to the failure of that ideal -- [than to seizing possibilities
for radical change]{.underline} in the present" (Brown, 1999, p. 19).
[[Suffering from]{.mark} a history of [defeat]{.mark} and embarrassment,
**[the left persist in a narcissistic identification with
failure]{.mark}**]{.underline}, fetishising the "good old days" and
remaining faithful to lost causes. As Benjamin himself points out, the
cynical kernel of this attitude is clear, as "melancholy betrays the
world for the sake of knowledge ... but in its tenacious self-absorption
it embraces dead objects in its consumption in order to redeem them"
(1998, p. 157). In other words, [the sentiment is a [deliberate
self-sabotage]{.mark} that takes place even before politics proper has a
chance to begin]{.underline} or "the paradox of an intention to mourn
that precedes and anticipates the loss of the object" (Žižek, 2001, p.
146). [This]{.underline} then [leads us to the second
problem]{.underline} of leftist cynicism: [anti-populism.]{.underline}
As a result of melancholia, [[the left has developed the bad habit of
prejudging all instances of popular]{.mark} radical
[expression]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as Brand's) [[as]{.mark}
necessarily [flawed.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, to return to Dean
again, she points out that **[[this aversion]{.mark} to being popular
and successful [is a defining feature of a contemporary left, who prefer
to adopt an "authentic" underdog position]{.mark} [in advance than take
risks towards political power.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As she argues,
[["we"]{.mark} on the left [see "ourselves" as "always]{.mark} morally
[correct but never]{.mark} politically
[responsible"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Dean, 2009, p. 6) **[[prepositioned
as righteous victims and proud political losers]{.mark} from the
outset.]{.underline}** What this cynicism towards instances of popular
radicalism ultimately means, therefore, is that any concern for
authenticity is ultimately a regressive one, a defence mechanism for a
left that "as long as it sees itself as defeated victims, can refrain
from having to admit is short on ideas" (Dean, 2009, p. 5). [Such an
attitude means never risking potential failure and residing in the
safety of marginal righteousness.]{.underline} It is the contention
here, therefore, that both melancholia and anti-populism can be seen in
the cynical reaction to Brand's radicalism. Somewhat ironically, Brand
(2013) even recognised these problems himself when he wrote in his *New
Statesman* piece that the right seeks converts while the left seeks
traitors ... this moral superiority that is peculiar to the left is a
great impediment towards momentum ... for an ideology that is defined by
inclusiveness, socialism has become in practice quite exclusive.
Automatically, then, the left denounce Brand and self-proclaimed
"radical left-wing thinkers and organisers" bitterly complain how he is
getting so much attention for the arguments they have been making for
years (for example, Park & Nastasia, 2013). The left maintain distance
and label Brand trivial, yet such a distance only renders these
critiques even more marginal and prevents them from becoming popular,
effective or counter-hegemonic. As Žižek has pointed out, [the political
issue of cynicism is "not that people 'do not know what they want' but
rather that cynical resignation prevents them from acting upon
it]{.underline}, with the result that a weird gap opens up between what
people think and how they act", adding that "today's post-political
silent majority is not stupid, but it is cynical and resigned" (2011, p.
390). In terms of Brand, [[this]{.mark} blanket [cynical]{.mark}
[melancholy is typical of the]{.mark} left's [distrust of anything
popular, rendering them "like **the last men" whose "immediate reaction
to idealism is mocking cynicism"**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Winlow & Hall,
2012, p. 13). [Proponents of a radical alternative immediately adopt
caution with the effect of forever delaying change, holding out for that
real and authentic (unbranded) struggle and therefore denying it
indefinitely]{.underline}.

around [a]{.mark} **general [sense of]{.mark} intellectual** and
**consumeristic [self-satisfaction]{.mark}** [as opposed to]{.mark}
**pressure-cooking it down** to a core of **[concerted political
actions]{.mark}** and **commitments**]{.underline}. The market for
leftist ideas and criticism is something akin to a concentrated mist:
refreshing in the moment, but ungraspable, and perhaps hazardous over
the longer term. Second claim: [this has largely been the result of
**fundamental changes** to the ways we write, share, act, and think that
have occurred under]{.underline} the system called ["**[communicative
capitalism]{.mark}**"---a system that encourages us to **communicate
more** even as the rapid proliferation of new platforms and outlets
**[sucks away]{.mark} the [potential]{.mark}** for our communications to
have **any sort of political impact**]{.underline}. Third claim: while
the writing and publishing left may be "succeeding" by the standards set
by communicative capitalism, [we're **actively feeding the mechanisms**
by which communicative capitalism **makes us obsolete**]{.underline}.

[The left has always relied on "**organs**" for **basic functions** of
its **many political bodies**]{.underline} (here we'll stick to print
and typed media, but this also includes radio, video, illustrations,
art, etc.). There's a beautiful and dusty history to publications like
New Masses, The Militant, The Daily Worker, and The Partisan Review in
the days of the "Old Left, succeeded by the New Left Review (itself the
product of a 1960 merger between The New Reasoner and Universities and
Left Review), politics, Dissent, Socialisme ou Barbarie, The Socialist
Register, Monthly Review, The National Guardian, In These Times, Mother
Jones, etc., to say nothing of anarchist zines and liberal pillars like
The Nation and The New Republic.

Take a cursory glance at some of the older issues of these and many more
publications, and note [our **recent intellectual
lineage**]{.underline}. Some of the writing is incredible, some of it
sucks, but one thing stands out immediately. These media outlets,
[representing **[different ideological]{.mark} factions** and
[**causes**, **never let you forget how** ]{.mark}**impressively
[goal-oriented they are]{.mark}**. Their communicative goals include,
but [aren't limited to: **introducing a working left agenda** to
moldable "publics]{.mark}"; **cultivating ways of viewing the world**
consistent with core leftist principles; **[providing a public forum for
key arguments]{.mark}** and **strategies** to be **debated**; organizing
targeted readerships]{.underline} (specific geographic, class,
employment-based, etc. demographics) [and **[mobilizing
resistance]{.mark} movements with urgent objectives** (**strikes**,
**unionization**, **congresses**, **positions to take on elections** and
**wars**, "**the revolution**," etc)]{.underline}.

Please resist the urge to write this question off as the ignorant
burbling of an idealistic wag: What are the goals of the typing and
publishing left today[? [If we are]{.underline}]{.mark}[,
**independently** or [**collectively**, organs of a political body,
**what is our function**]{.mark}?]{.underline} Even as a minor
participant in written leftism, [I have the]{.underline} same
**[knee-jerk responses]{.underline}** to this question that most would
have. [[Our function is to **critique**]{.mark}: to **expose the unseen
workings of unjust power**, to **enlighten** and "**sway public
opinion**." Our organs **take in the world's faults** and **explain
them** through a mode of political criticism that]{.underline}, for all
its variations, [is informed by **more-or-less shared
notions**]{.underline} of anti-capitalist resistance. We in the left
publishing world largely agree that the capitalist political economy is
far-reaching, evil, and violent, and [that forms of
injustice]{.underline} (like discrimination, persecution, exploitation,
etc.) [are **perpetuated by broad social-historical forces** whose
traces are **present in many institutions** and **traditions**
today]{.underline}. This core critique feels pretty consistent with the
work done by radical publications of the past.

[But this **hard work**, the **work of critique**, **doesn't really
qualify us as organs**. Even if they were **entirely unrealistic**, the
critiques from organs in bygone eras were **oriented toward targeted
groups achieving tangible goals**. [Today]{.mark}]{.underline}, by
contrast, [it's **seemingly a given** that critique is an **end in
itself**. [The **implied**]{.mark}, **intangible [goal]{.mark}** [of
"**raising public awareness**" is enough,]{.mark} and we **generally
assume** all the **conventional measures** of media
success---**popularity**, **traffic**, **virality**, **circulation
boosts**---are a **useful stand-in metric** for attaining that goal. And
with an **abundantly supplied market** for left critique, achieving this
goal **inherently depends** on strategies of **product
differentiation**]{.underline}---or, to borrow an ever-apt phrase from
the Freudian lexicon, the narcissism of small differences.

[The [**leading venues** for political]{.mark} criticism all seek to
**[differentiate themselves through rhetorical
style]{.mark}**]{.underline}, layout [**aesthetic**, and]{.underline},
to some extent, [**theoretical affiliations**. And they have **every
market incentive** to push these **second-order distinctions** over the
advancement of **any clear** and **overarching visions of what the world
should be** and **how to go about changing it**. And as producers and
consumers in this marketplace of political criticism, we're
**[encouraged]{.mark} not to tie ourselves down to one look**, but [to
**explore** and **cherry-pick arguments** from all over]{.mark} in a way
that **expresses the depth** and **variation** of our leftism while
confirming that leftism [itself has **become**]{.mark} **just that**---a
**[marketplace]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[The function of an organ is defined by the body it serves]{.underline}.
Without a body, it's just greasy tissue. So[,]{.underline} perhaps
[the]{.underline} better [question is: what body (or bodies) are we
serving?]{.underline} Is there a body at all, or has that question
become, in an all-too literal sense, immaterial to us? Behind the
thousands of faceless "likes" and "favorites" and shares and
subscriptions, is there a thunderous thing with teeth and fists? [Is
there]{.underline}, at this moment, for instance, [a **discernible body
of** and **for socialism** that we, as organs, are **helping to
sustain**? I suspect not]{.underline}. Almost all twenty-first-century
evidence suggests, instead, that [the bodies we like to think we're
commanding are **disjointed**, **dispersed**, and
**shapeless**]{.underline}. In fact, [[they're **not bodies**]{.mark}
**at all**, [just a **thousand points of light trying to outshine each
other**]{.mark}]{.underline} in cold, dead space.

Which means we are not organs. At best, we're organs in vitro, suspended
on our own, connected to nothing, taking in raw material through one
rubbery ventricle and passing through another some smart,
different-looking sludge that falls on the floor, splotch.

Two things: (1) Marxist theorist Jodi Dean has provided some of the most
illuminating studies of [how "**[communicative
capitalism]{.mark}**"---the marriage between [**neoliberalism** and our
**jungle of mass**]{.mark} and **social [media]{.mark}**---[has
created]{.mark} **multiple [traps]{.mark}**]{.underline} from which the
"academic and typing left" can't seem to escape; (2) you should be
reading Jodi Dean. For the sake of space, we'll just proceed assuming a
shared beginner's understanding of neoliberalism as, in David Harvey's
words, a "counterrevolutionary project" cooked up and "carried out by
the corporate capitalist class . . . \[who\] felt intensely threatened
both politically and economically towards the end of the 1960s into the
1970s . . . \[and who\] desperately wanted to launch a political project
that would curb the power of labor." Across the globe, this project has
taken many discrete forms, infiltrating bodies politic and, like a
virus, restructuring their DNA to destroy the tissue of Keynesian
liberal democracy and communism alike. It has likewise reconfigured the
playing field in the writing world, bigly.

[One of the **central goals** of the neoliberal project was to **replace
collective ways of living** with **thoroughly individualized ones**.
**Collective social** and **political formations**]{.underline} (labor
unions, mass movements, etc.) [were **dethroned** by the **righteousness
of solitary pursuits**]{.underline} (reclaiming the "right to work,"
becoming your own boss in a gig economy, fighting discrimination as a
personal matter, etc.). [Collective ways of taking the world
in]{.underline} (reading major newspapers, going to the movies, mass
marketing, or otherwise "tuning in" with the rest of the nation at
designated times) [gave way to a **utopia of personal
accommodation**]{.underline} (binge watch whatever and whenever you
want, personalize all commodities, follow whichever blogs or magazines
fit your tastes, control your content as you move through space walled
off by tiny earphones).

In this new, deeply individualistic media surround, [once power has been
**successfully transferred**]{.underline} from collective doing and
being to a burning desire for hyper-customized choice, once that has
become the gold standard of living well, then [we're **forever playing
on neoliberalism's turf**. [Neoliberalism has **successfully
engineered** our desire for an **ideal of freedom** molded from
**pre-existing models** of]{.mark}]{.underline} consumer choice ("have
it your way"), **[[self-care]{.underline}]{.mark}** ("because you're
worth it"), and personal uniqueness ("be together, not the same"), [and
it will **always be able to provide more avenues** for fulfilling that
desire]{.underline}. This absolutely applies to [the world of writing
and ideas]{.underline}, which [[appear]{.mark} to us [in an **endless**,
**Matrix-style candy store**]{.mark} from which we can **choose whatever
we need** to suit **whatever we want to be** at **any given
time**]{.underline}.

As Dean points out, this process is increasingly embedded in our hard-
and software. [Mass production of digital revolution
technologies]{.underline} (computers, the internet, digital and smart
phones, etc.) [have provided the **perfect media environment** for
neoliberalism to **materialize these changes to humanity** in the form
of communicative capitalism]{.underline}. And it's not hard to see how
[such changes have **profoundly altered the market** for leftist
thinking and political criticism]{.underline}. As a marriage between new
technologies and the neoliberal project, [[communicative capitalism gets
us to **buy into**, **become dependent on**,]{.mark} [and even
**celebrate**]{.mark} **the things** that are **[wiping]{.mark} our
political [resistance off the map]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Communicative capitalism opens up more opportunities for the left to
**communicate**, to **publish**, to **reach** and "**connect**" with
people, while also ensuring that such activities **actually strengthen
the very beast we love to think about overthrowing**]{.underline}. This
isn't just because our surfing, clicking, and communicating are
providing digital marketers and data harvesters with new revenue streams
and profit centers. [[The **real tectonic shift**]{.mark} here is the
creation [of a **digital universe**]{.mark}, a realm where people can
play out the fantasy of democracy while **growing evermore detached**
from the "**real world**" of neoliberal politics]{.underline}. Leftist
political criticism in the twenty-first century, like everything else
that circulates through our datastreams, is fundamentally caught up in,
and restructured by, the physics of that universe.

The first law of physics in the universe of communicative capitalism is
the fetishization of Capital-D Democracy, which it uses as a marketing
tool. "New media" invite us to participate (log in, communicate, click,
share, post, buy, etc.) under the banner of democratized access
(everyone can join) to democratized information (everything is
searchable) and the realization of a truly democratic public sphere
(everyone has a voice). This flexible bit of brand sloganeering promotes
a liberal humanist ideal of the democratic digital universe as a place
where pluralism reigns, where we all have different spaces to express
ourselves and connect with people and content that suit our different
identities and interests. Moreover, it assures us that we're actually
carrying out our democratic duties of communicating, speaking out,
deliberating, and sharing (more so than ever before) while also ensuring
that our politics are limited to just that: the circulation of content.
"In this mediated dimension," Dean writes, "politicians, governments,
and activists struggle for visibility, currency, and, in the now quaint
term from the dot-com years, mindshare. On the other hand . . .
institutional politics, the day-to-day activities of bureaucracies,
lawmakers, judges, and the apparatuses of the police and national
security state . . . seem to run independently of the politics that
circulates as content."

Now, this isn't to say that all digital politics is useless and that all
leftist criticism that does the bulk of its circulation online is purely
cerebral "slacktivism." Digital technologies have indeed made some
significant political action possible. And, of course, things have
gotten particularly interesting with Trump, who actually does seem to be
greatly affected by what goes on in the anything-goes world of the
internet. But that doesn't mean that the left can pretend it isn't, like
everyone else, still caught in this perverse and debilitating system.

We are facing a media market and a political arena in which
communication aggressively comes hither as an end in itself, alongside a
purely instrumental model of "democracy" as the circulation of content
with no need to promote action. We are trying to write our way out of a
networked system that has already captured our writing as another
commodity for people to choose from, as consumers, in order to suit
their individual, not collective, tastes in leftist critique. This isn't
to say that failure is a foregone conclusion, though; it is, however, to
say that, in order to begin conceptualizing how we might actually win in
the marketplace of ideas, we need to take full and honest measure of how
the game board tilts.

While the age of Trump is bringing more eyeballs to our articles and
more subscribers to sustain our efforts, that has little to no impact on
the much larger problems confronting leftist criticism and politics
under communicative capitalism. In fact, [such **[provisional
victories]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the digital mediasphere [**might
actually be bad** if they **[lull us into the false sense]{.mark}** that
[things are **going smoothly**]{.mark} and that **our ideas** and
**arguments** are becoming **gradually more ubiquitous**. When
contrasted with **historic levels of inequality**, **perpetual war**,
**climate instability**, the **Trumpian takeover** of American
government, etc., the **very notion that greater circulation corresponds
to leftist success proves**]{.underline} that the digital universe is
every bit as **[disconnected]{.underline}** from everything else as Dean
claims.

"Traffic," "circulation," and "uniques" are the expressed goals of any
publication in the digital age. These are the metrics keeping most
publications alive. But [we are]{.underline} suicidally
[**\[tragically\] misguided** to think that these things **correspond to
any graspable success** for the left itself or its internal "**battle of
ideas**."]{.underline} To make this sobering point more sobering, we can
use these same metrics to note that the top leftist publications are
still getting traffic-whipped by morons like Tomi Lahren or even Rush
Limbaugh.

Even worse, [for venues of leftist political criticism, there's a
**general sense** that [we can **gain traffic**]{.mark} **now**,
[**build up a base**, and **mobilize**]{.mark}
**[later]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But, again, [one **has to wonder** if
**increasing our circulation** corresponds to **building a base** that
can **actually be mobilized** when "**the time is right**."]{.underline}
My reluctant but unambiguous verdict here is that [**no**, **we are
not**. Otherwise, **what the hell have we been waiting
for**?]{.underline} Maybe we've already registered awareness of this at
some gut level already, and we realize at bottom that ["**getting more
traffic**" is **[just an excuse]{.mark}** we can use to **[always defer
action we know won't come]{.mark}**]{.underline}---a can we're able to
perpetually kick down a dusty, desert road to never.

For the new generation, [**socialism is rising** as a **forceful
feeling**]{.underline}, yes, [but it's **still incredibly
nebulous**]{.underline}. So nebulous, in fact, that many of us
millennials still wanted to see if it could attach itself to, and become
concrete through, the resistant body of a thoroughly neoliberal
Democratic Party. It can't. And [it **[must now be called forth
into]{.mark}**]{.underline} other [[**viable forms** that can be
**followed** and **supported**]{.mark}, or else it will **join the other
wandering souls** of bodiless leftist ideas that give us all **plenty to
write about** and **little to hope for**]{.underline}.

[**Just [acknowledging these obstacles]{.mark}** for leftist political
criticism **[won't make them go away]{.mark}**. To **fight for a
[leftist future]{.mark} while combating the traps of communicative
capitalism**, we **need to do more**, and some of it won't be
pleasant]{.underline}. It goes without saying that [leftist criticism
**can't just point to** or **encourage action**; it needs to be
**steeped in it from the beginning**]{.underline}. In the same vein,
[publications **can't just be venues for critical reflection** on
political action---they [must]{.mark} be **vital organs** whose
functions [include **mobilization**, **strategizing**, and
**on-the-ground collaboration**]{.mark} with the
**grassroots**.]{.underline}

[Leftist critics need to **get out of their head**]{.underline} right
now (yesterday, in fact) [the idea that **more** and **different
critique is an end in itself**. There will **always be opportunities**
to make **newer** and **[better critiques]{.mark}** in the media market
of communicative capitalism, but this **doesn't address the basic
problem** that there is now]{.underline}, by most measures, [a **glut of
good criticism** out there already. [Did any of it]{.mark}]{.underline}
secure a victory for Sanders over Clinton? Did it **[stop
Trump]{.underline}**? Did any of it [**stall [the prison-industrial
complex]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} **stop [ICE raids]{.mark}**]{.underline}
under Obama and now Trump?

[Lack of critique is **not our problem**---more and better **will not
alone be enough** to strike back against these grim forces. And the
**more that we each individually entertain our**]{.underline} egoistic
[**desire** to be **distanced intellectual leaders of a movement through
our criticisms**, the **less we'll be able to see things as they really
are**, and to **call them by their true names**. For all the talk of
growing resistance, there's **no serious connection between leftist
critique** and **some consistent movement**---yet]{.underline}. And, [as
of this moment, we critics are]{.underline} carrying on like thousands
of Don Quixotes, [all **charging in different directions with no one
behind us**]{.underline}. (And, yes, I'm as guilty of operating under
such delusions as the next person---that's the point.)

Once we've set aside the seductions of memeing, we must understand and
take seriously that we are embarked on something far more momentous.
We're now plunged into the thick of a battle royale for the soul (and
body) of the left. [How do we contribute to **summoning the
actually-existing political bodies** for which we can be **vital
organs**?]{.underline} How do we begin to coax forth something solid,
consistent, from the hazy and dispersed leftist non-body? [[How do
we]{.mark} **throw down forms** of political criticism that **[actively
refuse]{.mark}** to be **casually absorbed by permanently scattered
individuals** in an intellectual market of leftism that, under
communicative capitalism, most resembles a **thrift store** where
different brands can be **mixed** and **matched to each consumer's
liking**?]{.underline}

For starters, [[we need **more goal-oriented**]{.underline}]{.mark}
journalistic campaigns, [**[campaigns]{.mark} that repeatedly fuse
critical positions** and **political demands with clear** and **present
visions for mobilization**. Campaigns that **collaborate with** and
**harness existing mobilization efforts**]{.underline}. As with
political journalism of the past, which heavily featured local labor
leaders, political actors, and imminent concerns, our [campaigns should
**more collectively strive to summon forth an urgency** in readers whose
reading **activity [embroils them]{.mark}** [in a **drastic political
landscape**]{.mark} that is **[unfolding right now]{.mark}** (**not just
in abstract arguments** or **visions of a distant past** or
**future**)]{.underline}. To capture the critical now-ness of our daily
reading, for example, our campaigns should continue to make the work and
positions of activists like Aly Wane, Lucas Benitez, and
Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor as much, if not more, of a recurring focus than
Debord, Rorty, and Gramsci.

At historical moments of extreme tension, like our own, [such campaigns
**helped bring forth**, starting with **relatively small student
protests** in '68 Paris, the **mobilization of a general strike
demanding worker** and **student rights**, **antiwar measures**, and the
**potential resignation of a national leader**. Such [campaigns]{.mark},
which would **eventually help relay** and **articulate demands [for
policy changes]{.mark}** and **community action**, **[grew out
of]{.mark}**, and **learned from**, **[local grassroots efforts by
black]{.mark} civil rights [activists]{.mark}** organizing the
**boycotts**, **sit-ins**, "**freedom rides**," etc]{.underline}.
Regardless of how things changed drastically after WWII, [such campaigns
helped **foment an American labor movement with considerable communist
influence**.]{.underline}

[Perhaps another byproduct of a revived on-the-ground focus]{.underline}
for leftist political journalism [will be the need for individual
outlets to **concretize actual schools of thought** and **strategy**
that can be **differentiated** from each other]{.underline}. Perhaps, in
other words, [people **must be encouraged to take sides**]{.underline}.
This is not because our leftist infighting and jockeying for position is
somehow more important than the larger battles we are collectively
facing. Rather, [we may very well recognize that the **stakes are so
high now** that this is an **unavoidable move**, one of the **few things
we can actually do** to draw ourselves]{.underline} and our readers out
of the communicative capitalist haze, to summon ourselves [into
**working**, **organized leftist bodies**. It may be **one of the only
ways left to suit up** and **take leftist politics out of the neoliberal
marketplace of circulating content** and **put it back onto the
battlefield**, where it belongs]{.underline}.

### 1nc link -- identity

#### Ideologies of ascriptive difference serve to stabilize labor relations in the class hierarchy---Marxism is key to demystify the role of identity within broader class conflict---voting aff only makes neolib more efficient

**Reed 13** \[Adolph, professor of political science at the University
of Pennsylvania, specializing in race and American politics. He has
taught at Yale, Northwestern and the New School for Social Research. An
expert on racial and economic inequality, he is a founding member of the
Labor Party and a frequent contributor to The Nation, *New Labor Forum*
22.1, "Marx, Race, and Neoliberalism," 2013\]

[A Marxist perspective can be most helpful for understanding race and
racism insofar as it perceives capitalism]{.underline} dialectically,
[as]{.underline} a social totality that includes modes of production,
relations of production, and [the pragmatically evolving ensemble of
institutions and ideologies that lubricate and propel its reproduction.
From this perspective, [Marxism's most important contribution]{.mark} to
making sense of race]{.underline} and racism in the United States [[may
be demystification]{.mark}. A historical materialist perspective should
stress that ["race"]{.mark}]{.underline}---which includes "racism," as
one is unthinkable without the other---[[is a historically specific
ideology]{.mark} that emerged]{.underline}, took shape,
[and]{.underline} has [evolved]{.underline} as a constitutive element
within a definite set of social relations [[anchored to a]{.mark}
particular [system of production]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Race]{.mark} is]{.underline} a taxonomy of ascriptive difference, that
is, [an ideology that [constructs]{.mark} populations as groups and
sorts them into [hierarchies]{.mark}]{.underline} of capacity, civic
worth, and desert [[based on]{.mark}]{.underline} "natural" or
[[essential characteristics]{.mark} attributed to them. **[Ideologies of
ascriptive difference]{.mark}** help to [stabilize a social order by
legitimizing it]{.mark}s hierarchies of wealth, power, and privilege,
including its social division of labor, [as]{.mark} the [natural]{.mark}
order of things]{.underline}.1 [Ascriptive ideologies]{.underline} are
just-so stories with the potential to become self-fulfilling prophecies.
They [emerge from self-interested common sense as folk knowledge: they
are "known" to be true unreflectively because they seem to comport
with]{.underline} the evidence of [quotidian experience. They
are]{.underline} likely to become generally [assumed as
self-evident]{.underline} truth, [and imposed as such by law and
custom]{.underline}, when they converge with and reinforce the interests
of powerful strata in the society.

[[Race and gender are]{.mark} the [most familiar]{.mark} ascriptive
hierarchies]{.underline} in the contemporary United States. [Ironically,
that is so in part because egalitarian forces have been]{.underline}
successful in the last half-century in [challenging them]{.underline}
and their legal and material foundations. Inequalities based directly on
claims of race and gender difference are now negatively sanctioned as
discrimination by law and prevailing cultural norms. [[Of course,
patterns of inequality persist]{.underline}]{.mark} in which
disadvantage is distributed asymmetrically along racial and gender
lines, [[but practically no one]{.underline}]{.mark}---even among
apologists for those patterned inequalities--- [openly [admits
to]{.mark} espousing [racism or sexism]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[It is telling in this regard that Glenn Beck stretches to appropriate
M]{.underline}artin [L]{.underline}uther [K]{.underline}ing, Jr., [and
denounces]{.underline} Barack [Obama as racist, and that]{.underline}
Elisabeth [Hasselbeck and Ann Coulter accuse Democrats of
sexism]{.underline}. Indeed, [[just as race has
been]{.underline}]{.mark} and continues to be [[unthinkable without
racism]{.mark}, today [it is]{.mark} also [unthinkable without
antiracism]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Crucially, the significance of race and gender, and their content as
ideologies of essential difference have changed markedly over time in
relation to changing political and economic conditions. Regarding race
in particular, [classificatory schemes have varied substantially, as
have the narratives elaborating them. That is, [which populations count
as races]{.mark}, the criteria determining them, and [the stakes]{.mark}
attached to counting as one, or as one or another at any given time,
[have been]{.mark}]{.underline} much [[more fluid]{.mark} matters
[than]{.mark} our [discussions]{.mark} of the notion would
[suggest]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[And that is]{.underline} as it must be [because race, like all
ideologies of ascriptive hierarchy, is fundamentally pragmatic. After
all, [these]{.mark} belief [systems emerge as]{.mark} legitimations of
[concrete]{.mark}]{.underline} patterns of [[social relations]{.mark} in
particular contexts]{.underline}.

[Race emerged historically along with the institution of
slavery]{.underline} in the New World. A rich scholarship examines its
emergence, perhaps most signally with respect to North America in Edmund
Morgan's American Slavery, American Freedom and Kathleen Brown's Good
Wives, Nasty Wenches, and Anxious Patriarchs. Both focus on the
simultaneous sharpening of distinctions between slavery and indentured
servitude, and the institutional establishment of black and white, or
African and English, as distinct, mutually exclusive status categories
over the course of the seventeenth century in colonial Virginia.2 Race
and racism took shape as an ideology and material reality during the
following century initially in the context of the contest between
free-and slave-labor systems and the related class struggle that
eventually produced the modern notion of free labor as the absolute
control of a worker over her or his person.3

[[After]{.underline}]{.mark} defeat of the Confederate insurrection led
to slavery's [[abolition, race]{.mark} as white supremacy
[evolved]{.mark} in the South as an element [in the struggle
over]{.mark} what [freedom]{.mark} was to mean [and how it would be
harmonized with the]{.mark}]{.underline} plantocracy's desired [[labor
system]{.underline}]{.mark} and the social order required to maintain
it. [That struggle culminated in [the]{.mark} planter-dominated [ruling
class's victory]{.mark}, which [was consolidated in]{.mark}]{.underline}
racialized [[disfranchisement and]{.underline}]{.mark} imposition of the
codified white supremacist regime of racial
[[segregation]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the]{.underline} West
Coast [[fights over]{.underline}]{.mark} importation of [Chinese labor
and Japanese [immigration]{.mark} also [condensed around]{.mark}
racialist [ideologies. Railroad operators]{.mark} and other importers of
Chinese labor [imagined that Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline} workers'
distinctive [[racial characteristics made them more tractable]{.mark}
and capable of living on less]{.underline} than white Americans;
opponents argued that those very racial characteristics would degrade
American labor and that Chinese were racially "unassimilable."
Postbellum [[southern planters imported Chinese to the Mississippi
Delta]{.mark} to compete with black sharecroppers [out of the
same]{.mark}]{.underline} racialist [[presumptions]{.underline}]{.mark}
of greater tractability, [[as did later importers of Sicilian
labor]{.mark} to the sugarcane and cotton fields]{.underline}.

[Large-scale industrial production]{.underline} in the latenineteenth
and early-twentieth centuries, [of course, depended on mass labor
immigration mainly from the eastern and southern fringes of
Europe]{.underline}. The innovations of race science---that is, of
racialist folk ideology transformed into an academic
profession---promised to assist employers' needs for rational labor
force management and were present in the foundation of the fields of
industrial relations and industrial psychology. Hugo Münsterberg, a
founding luminary of industrial psychology, included "race psychological
diagnosis" as an element in assessment of employees' capabilities,
although he stressed that racial or national temperaments are averages
and that there is considerable individual variation within groups. He
argued that assessment, therefore, should be leavened with consideration
of individuals' characteristics and that the influence of "group
psychology" would be significant only if the employment not of a single
person, but of a large number, is in question, as it is most probable
that the average character will show itself in a sufficient degree as
soon as many members of the group are involved.4

[As]{.underline} scholarship on race science and its kissing cousin,
[eugenics]{.underline}, [has shown, research that sets out to find
evidence of racial difference will find it, whether or not it
exists.]{.underline} Thus, race science produced increasingly refined
taxonomies of racial groups---up to as many as sixty-three "basic"
races. The apparent specificity of race theorists' just-so stories about
differential racial capacities provided rationales for immigration
restriction, sterilization, segregation, and other regimes of
inequality. [It also held out the promise of assisting employers in
assigning workers to jobs]{.underline} for which they were racially
suited. John Bodnar and his coauthors reproduce a Racial Adaptability
Chart used by a Pittsburgh company in the 1920s that maps thirty-six
different racial groups' capacities for twenty-two distinct jobs, eight
different atmospheric conditions, jobs requiring speed or precision, and
day or night shift work. For example, Letts were supposedly fair with
pick and shovel, and concrete and wheelbarrow, bad as hod carriers,
cleaners and caretakers, and boilermaker's helpers; good as coal passers
and blacksmiths as well as at jobs requiring speed or precision; and
good in cool and dry, smoky or dusty conditions; fair in oily or dirty
processes; and good on both day and night shifts.5

[Of course, all this was bogus, nothing more than narrow upper-class
prejudices parading about as science]{.underline}. It was convincing
only if one shared the folk narratives of essential hierarchy that the
research assumed from the outset. [But the race theories did not have to
be true to be effective.]{.underline} They had only to be used as if
they were true to produce the material effects that gave the ideology an
authenticating verisimilitude. [[Poles became steel workers]{.mark} in
Pittsburgh]{.underline}, Baltimore, Buffalo, Chicago, and Gary [not for
any natural]{.underline} aptitude or [affinity but
[because]{.mark}]{.underline} employers and [[labor recruiters sorted
them]{.mark} into work in steel mills]{.underline}.

[Even the New Deal embedded premises of racial and gender
hierarchy]{.underline} in its most fundamental policy initiatives. [The
longer-term implications of the two-tiered system of social benefits
thus created persist]{.underline} to the present day. [[This]{.mark}
[extensive history illustrates that]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Marxist
theorist Harry Chang observed in the 1970s, [[racial formation has
always been an aspect of class]{.mark} formation, as a "social condition
of production." Race has been a constitutive element in a capitalist
social dynamic in which "social types (instead of persons) figure as
basic units of]{.underline} economic and political
[management]{.underline}."6 [[Chang]{.underline}]{.mark} perceptively
[[analogized race to what Marx described as the fetish character of
money. Marx]{.mark}, he noted, [described money as]{.mark}]{.underline}
"the officiating object (or subject as an object) in the reification of
a relation called value" and as [[a "function-turned-into-an-object."
Race is similarly a function]{.mark}---[a relation of hierarchy]{.mark}
[rooted in the capitalist division of labor---turned into an
object]{.mark}]{.underline}.7 "[[Money seeks gold to objectify
itself]{.mark}--- [gold does not cry out to be money."]{.mark}
[Similarly]{.mark}, "[the cutting edge of racial determinations of
persons is a social]{.mark} '[imposition']{.mark}]{.underline} on
nature," which on its own yields no such categories.8

Research that sets out to find evidence of racial difference will find
it, whether or not it exists. [Although discussing race specifically,
[Chang also puts his finger on the central characteristic of ideologies
of ascriptive hierarchy in general:]{.mark} In practice, [the political
economic]{.mark} [raison d'etre]{.mark} [of racial categories lies in
the]{.mark} ironclad [social validity]{.mark} that is [possible if
relations are]{.mark} [objectified as]{.mark} the intrinsic quality of
"[racial features]{.mark}."]{.underline} Blacks as the absence of the
minimum guarantee of bourgeois rights (against enslavement and bondage)
presupposes Whites as a guarantee of immunity from such social
degradation.9

[[This]{.mark} formulation [applies equally to populations stigmatized
as feebleminded,]{.mark} natural-born [criminals, "white trash,"]{.mark}
[poverty cultures]{.mark}, [the underclass,]{.mark} [crack
babies]{.mark}, superpredators, [and other narratives]{.mark} of
ascriptive hierarchy. [Each]{.mark} such [narrative]{.mark} [is a
species of the genus of ideologies that legitimize capitalist social
relations by naturalizing them]{.mark}. [The]{.mark} characteristic
[link]{.mark}ing the]{.underline} species of this genus of [ascriptive
ideologies [is that they are]{.mark}]{.underline} populations living, if
not exactly [[outside]{.mark} "the]{.underline} minimum [guarantee of
[bourgeois rights,"]{.mark}]{.underline} at least beneath the customary
floor of social worth and regard. In practice, the latter devolves
toward the former.

Chang's perspective may help us see more clearly how ascriptive
ideologies function. [It]{.underline} certainly [is no surprise that
dominant classes operate among themselves within a common sense that
understands their dominance unproblematically, as]{.underline} decreed
by [the nature of things]{.underline}. At moments [when their dominance
faces challenges, those narratives may be articulated more
assertively]{.underline} and for broader dissemination. [[This
logic]{.mark}, for example, [underlay the]{.mark} antebellum [shift, in
the face of mounting antislavery agitation, from]{.mark} pragmatic
[defenses of slavery as a necessary evil]{.mark}]{.underline}---a stance
that presumed a ruling class speaking among itself alone---[[to
essentialist arguments, putatively transcending class]{.mark}
interests,]{.underline} namely, [that slavery was a positive
good]{.underline}. It also may be seen in the explosion of racialist
ideology in its various forms, including eugenics, in justifying
imperialist expansionism and consolidating the defeat of populism and
working-class insurgency in the years overlapping the turn of the
twentieth century. That same dynamic was at work displacing the language
of class and political economy by culture and culturology in the postwar
liberalism that consolidated the defeat of CIO radicalism. Later, racial
essentialism helped reify the struggles against southern segregation,
racial discrimination, inequality, and poverty during the 1960s by
separating discussions of injustice from capitalism's logic of
reproduction. Poverty was reinvented as a cultural dilemma, and "white
racism" singled out as the root of racial inequality.

[In this way, Chang's perspective can be helpful in sorting
out]{.underline} several [important limitations in discussions
of]{.underline} [race and class characteristic of today's
left.]{.underline} It can also help to make sense of the striking
convergence between the relative success of identitarian understandings
of social justice and the steady, intensifying advance of neoliberalism.
It suggests a kinship where many on the left assume an enmity. [The rise
of neolib]{.underline}eralism [in particular suggests a serious problem
with arguments that represent race and class as dichotomous]{.underline}
or alternative [frameworks of political critique]{.underline} and
action, [as well as those arguments that posit the dichotomy while
attempting to reconcile its elements with formalistic gestures, for
example, the]{.underline} common ["race and class"
construction.]{.underline}

This sort of [[historical materialist perspective throws into relief
a]{.mark} fundamental [limitation of the "whiteness"
notion]{.mark}]{.underline} that has been fashionable [[within
the]{.mark} academic [left]{.mark}]{.underline} for roughly two decades:
[it reifies whiteness as a transhistorical social category. In effect,
it treats "whiteness"--- and therefore "race"---]{.underline}as existing
prior to and [above social context]{.underline}.10 [[Both who qualifies
as white and the significance of being white have altered over
time.]{.mark} Moreover, [whiteness discourse functions as a kind of
moralistic exposé rather than a basis for strategic politics; this is
clear in]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} program
signally articulated in its name has been simply to raise a [[demand to
"abolish whiteness,"]{.mark} that is, to call on whites to renounce
their racial privilege. In fact, [its fixation on]{.mark} demonstrating
the depth of [whites' embrace of]{.mark}]{.underline} what was known to
an earlier generation's version of this argument as "white skin
[[privilege]{.underline}]{.mark}" and the inclination to slide into
teleological accounts in which groups or individuals "approach" or
"pursue" whiteness [[erases the real]{.mark} historical
[dynamics]{.mark}]{.underline} and contradictions
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} American [[racial
history]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The]{.mark} whiteness [discourse overlaps other arguments that
presume]{.mark}]{.underline} racism to be [a [sui generis]{.mark} form
of [injustice]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite seeming provocative, these
arguments do not go beyond the premises of the racial liberalism from
which they commonly purport to dissent. [They differ only in rhetorical
flourish, not content.]{.underline} Formulations that invoke metaphors
of disease or original sin reify racism by disconnecting it from the
discrete historical circumstances and social structures in which it is
embedded, and treating it as an autonomous force. [Disconnection from
political economy is also a crucial feature of postwar liberalism's
construction of racial inequality as prejudice]{.underline} or
intolerance. [[Racism becomes an independent variable in a moralistic
argument that is idealist intellectually and ultimately defeatist
politically]{.underline}]{.mark}.

This tendency to see racism as sui generis also generates a resistance
to precision in analysis. It is fueled by a tendency to inflate the
language of racism to the edge of its reasonable conceptual limits, if
not beyond. [Ideological commitment to shoehorning into the rubric of
racism all manner of inequalities that may appear statistically as
racial disparities has yielded]{.underline} two related [interpretive
pathologies. One is a constantly expanding panoply of
neologisms---"]{.underline} institutional racism," ["systemic racism,"
"structural racism,"]{.underline} "color-blind racism," ["post-racial
racism," etc.---]{.underline} [intended to graft more complex social
dynamics]{.underline} [onto a simplistic]{.underline} and frequently
psychologically inflected racism/anti-racism [political
ontology]{.underline}. Indeed, these efforts bring to mind \[Thomas S.\]
Kuhn's account of attempts to accommodate mounting anomalies to salvage
an interpretive paradigm in danger of crumbling under a crisis of
authority.11

[A second essentialist sleight-of-hand advances claims]{.underline} for
the primacy of race/racism as an explanation of inequalities in the
present [by invoking analogies to regimes of explicitly racial
subordination in the past]{.underline}. [[In these arguments, analogy
stands in for]{.mark} evidence and [explanation of the
contemporary]{.mark} centrality of racism]{.underline}. Michelle
Alexander's widely read and cited book, The New Jim Crow, is only the
most prominent expression of this tendency; even she has to acknowledge
that the analogy fails because the historical circumstances are so
radically different.12 Rigorous pursuit of equality of opportunity
exclusively within the terms of capitalist class relations has been
fully legitimized under the rubric of "diversity."

From the historical materialist standpoint, the view of racial
inequality as a sui generis injustice and dichotomous formulations of
the relation of race and class as systems of hierarchy in the United
States are not only miscast but also fundamentally counterproductive.
[It is]{.underline} particularly [important]{.underline} at this moment
[to]{.underline} [recognize]{.underline} [that the]{.underline} familiar
[taxonomy of [racial difference is but one historically specific
instance of a genus of ideologies]{.mark} of ascriptive hierarchy [that
stabilize capitalist]{.mark} social [reproduction]{.mark}.]{.underline}
I have argued previously that [[entirely new]{.mark} race-like
[taxonomies could]{.mark} come to [displace the familiar
ones]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, [[the "underclass" could
become]{.underline}]{.mark} even more race-like as [[a
distinctive]{.mark}, [essentialized population]{.mark}]{.underline}, by
our current folk norms, [[multiracial in composition]{.mark},
albeit]{.underline} most likely [including in]{.underline} perceptibly
[greater frequencies people]{.underline} who would be [classified as
black and Latino "racially," though as small enough pluralities to
preclude assimilating the group ideologically as a simple proxy for
nonwhite inferiors]{.underline}.13

This possibility looms larger now. [[Struggles]{.mark} for racial and
gender equality]{.underline} have largely divested race and gender of
their common sense verisimilitude as bases for essential difference.
Moreover, versions of racial and gender equality are now also
incorporated into the normative and programmatic structure of "left"
neoliberalism. Rigorous pursuit of equality of opportunity exclusively
[[within the terms of]{.underline}]{.mark} given patterns of
[[cap]{.mark}italist class relations]{.underline}---which is after all
the ideal of racial liberalism---has been fully legitimized within the
rubric of "diversity." That ideal is realized through gaining rough
parity in distribution of social goods and bads among designated
population categories. As Walter Benn Michaels has argued powerfully,
according to that ideal, the society [[would be just if 1 percent of the
population controlled 90 percent of the resources, provided that blacks
and other nonwhites, women, and]{.mark} lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
transgender ([LGBT) people were]{.mark} represented [among the 1 percent
in]{.mark} roughly [similar proportion]{.mark}]{.underline} as their
incidence in the general population.14

Given the triumph of racial liberalism, it is entirely possible that
[new discourses of ascriptive difference might take shape that fit the
folk common sense]{.underline} of our time and its cultural norms and
sensibilities. Indeed, the explosive resurgence in recent years of
academically legitimated determinist discourses---all of which simply
rehearse the standard idealist tropes and circular garbage in/garbage
out faux scientific narratives---reinforce that concern. The
undergirding premises of intellectual programs like evolutionary
psychology, behavioral economics, genes and politics, and
neurocriminology are strikingly like straight-line extrapolations from
Victorian race science--- although for the most part, though not
entirely, scholars operating in those areas are scrupulous, or at least
fastidious, in not implicating the familiar racial taxonomies in their
deterministic sophistries. Some scholars imagine that "epigenetics"---a
view that focuses on the interplay of genes and environment in producing
organisms and genotypes---avoids determinism by providing causal
explanations that are not purely biological. Recent research purporting
to find epigenetic explanations for socioeconomic inequality already
foreshadows a possible framework for determinist "underclass" narratives
that avoid the taints associated with biological justifications of
inequality and references to currently recognized racial categories.15
Ironically, some enthusiasts for this epigenetic patter expressly liken
it to Lamarckian evolutionary theory, which stressed the heritability of
characteristics acquired after birth, as though this were insulation
against determinism. As historian of anthropology George Stocking, Jr.,
and others have shown, Lamarckian race theory was no less determinist
than its Darwinian alternative, which posited strictly biological
determinism. As Stocking notes, Lamarckians' dependence on a "vague
sociobiological indeterminism" made it all the more difficult to
challenge their circular race theories.16 In any event, narrow
approaches that reduce ascriptive ideology to reified notions of
race/racism are not at all up to the challenge posed by this new
determinist turn.

Finally, the adamant commitment to a racefirst perspective on
inequalities that show up as statistical disparities has a material
foundation. [The victories of the civil rights movement carried with
them a more]{.underline} benign and [unavoidable political imperative.
Legal remedies can be sought for injustices understood as discrimination
on the basis of race, gender, or other familiar categories]{.underline}
of invidious ascription; [no such recourse exists for injustices
generated through capitalism's logic of production and reproduction
without mediation through]{.underline} one of those [ascriptive
categories]{.underline}. As I have argued elsewhere, this makes
identifying "racism" a technical requirement for pursuing certain
grievances, not the basis of an overall strategy for pursuit of racial
justice, or, as I believe is a clearer left formulation, racial equality
as an essential component of a program of social justice.17 [Yet, for
those who insist that racial reductionism is more than a pragmatic
accommodation to the necessities of pursuing]{.underline} legal or
administrative [grievances, something more is at play. A historical
materialist perspective can be helpful for identifying the glue that
binds that commitment to]{.underline} a race-first political discourse
and [practice]{.underline}.

[[All politics]{.mark} in capitalist society [is]{.mark} class, or [at
least a class-inflected, politics. That is also true
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the political perspective that condenses in
[programs such as [reparations, antiracism, and insistence on]{.mark}
the sui generis character of racial [injustice]{.mark}]{.underline}. I
submit that [[those tendencies come together around a]{.mark} politics
that is "entirely consistent with the [neoliberal redefinition of
equality]{.mark}]{.underline} and democracy along disparitarian lines."
[[That]{.mark} politics [reflects]{.mark} the social position of [those
positioned to benefit from the view that the market]{.mark} is, or [can
be]{.mark}]{.underline}, a [[just]{.underline}]{.mark}, effective, or
even acceptable, system for rewarding talent and virtue and punishing
their opposites [[and that]{.mark}, therefore, [removal of "artificial"
impediments]{.mark} to functioning [like race and gender will make it
even more efficient]{.mark}]{.underline} and just.18

[[This is the politics of]{.underline}]{.mark} actual or would-be [[race
relations administrators, and it is]{.underline}]{.mark} completely
embedded within American capitalism and its structures of elite
brokerage. It is [[fundamentally antagonistic to working-class politics,
notwithstanding left identitarians' gestural claims to the
contrary]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Identity politics [is neoliberalism]{.underline} and prevents class analysis -- our critique doesn't obviate differences but explains intersectionality better because of the importance of materiality. 

**Norton & Reed 15** --- Ben Norton an investigative journalist //
Adolph Reed a Professor of political science at the University of
Pennsylvania ("Adolph Reed: Identity Politics Is Neoliberalism," 29 Jun
2015,
<http://bennorton.com/adolph-reed-identity-politics-is-neoliberalism/>,
accessed 12 Jul 2016)

Political scientist and race theorist Adolph Reed has long maintained
that **[[identity politics is]{.underline}]{.mark}** a form of
**[[neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In a June article, he
explains:

[[(Identity) politics is not an alternative to class politics]{.mark};
it is]{.underline} a class politics, [the politics of the left-wing of
neoliberalism]{.underline}. [[It is the]{.mark} expression and [active
agency of a political]{.mark} order [and moral economy in which]{.mark}
capitalist [market forces are]{.mark} treated as
[unassailable]{.mark}]{.underline} nature.

[[An integral element]{.mark} of that moral economy [is displacement of
the critique of]{.mark} the]{.underline} invidious [outcomes produced by
capitalist [class power onto]{.mark} equally [naturalized categories of
ascriptive identity]{.mark} that sort us into groups supposedly defined
by what we essentially are rather than what we do]{.underline}. As I
have argued, following Walter Michaels and others, [[**within that moral
economy a society in which 1% of the population controlled 90% of the
resources could be just**, provided that]{.mark} roughly [12% of the 1%
were black, 12%]{.mark} were [Latino, 50%]{.mark} were [women]{.mark},
and whatever the appropriate proportions were LGBT people]{.underline}.

It would be tough to imagine a normative ideal that expresses more
unambiguously the social position of [[people]{.underline}]{.mark} who
[[consider themselves]{.mark} candidates [for inclusion
in]{.mark}]{.underline}, or at least significant staff positions in
service to, [[the ruling class]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Reed has been arguing this point for years. In his 2009 essay "The
Limits of Anti-Racism," Reed condemns [**identity politics** for,
despite its putative good intentions, **[disguising objectively
right-wing, neoliberal ideology with superficially "progressive"
rhetorical window dressing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Reed's criticisms of
"antiracism" can been taken to be criticisms of identity politics more
generally (emphasis mine).

[Antiracism is a favorite concept on the]{.underline} American
[left]{.underline} these days. [Of course, all good sorts want to be
against racism, but what does the word mean exactly?]{.underline}

The contemporary discourse of "[antiracism]{.underline}" ([and [identity
politics]{.mark} overall]{.underline}) [[is focused]{.mark} much [more
on **taxonomy than politics**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It emphasizes the
name by which we should call some strains of inequality]{.underline} ---
whether they [should be]{.underline} broadly [recognized as evidence of
"racism"]{.underline} --- [[over specifying the **mechanisms that
produce** them or]{.mark} even the **[steps that can be taken to combat
them]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [And, no, [**neither "overcoming racism"
nor "rejecting whiteness" qualifies as such a step** any more
than]{.mark} does [waiting for]{.mark} the "revolution" or urging [God's
heavenly intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}. If organizing a rally
against racism seems at present to be a more substantive political act
than attending a prayer vigil for world peace, that's only because
contemporary antiracist activists understand themselves to be employing
the same tactics and pursuing the same ends as their predecessors in the
period of high insurgency in the struggle against racial segregation.

This view, however, is mistaken. The postwar activism that reached its
crescendo in the South as the "civil rights movement" wasn't a movement
against a generic "racism;" it was specifically and explicitly directed
toward full citizenship rights for black Americans and against the
system of racial segregation that defined a specific regime of
explicitly racial subordination in the South. [The]{.underline} 1940s
[March on Washington Movement was]{.underline} also [directed against
specific targets, like employment discrimination]{.underline} in defense
production. Black Power era and post-Black Power era struggles similarly
focused on combating specific inequalities and pursuing specific goals
like the effective exercise of voting rights and specific programs of
redistribution.

Whether or not one considers [those goals]{.underline} correct or
appropriate, they [were clear and strategic in a way that]{.underline}
"antiracism" ([identity politics]{.underline}) [simply is
not]{.underline}. Sure, those earlier struggles relied on a discourse of
racial justice, but their targets were concrete and strategic. [It is
only in a period of political demobilization that the [historical
specificities of]{.mark} those [struggles have become smoothed out of
sight in a romantic idealism that homogenizes them into]{.mark} timeless
abstractions like "[the black liberation movement]{.mark}"]{.underline}
--- [an entity [that]{.mark}]{.underline}, like Brigadoon, [sporadically
appears and [returns impelled by its own logic]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Ironically, as the basis for a politics]{.underline}, antiracism
([[identity politics]{.underline}]{.mark}) [seems to reflect, several
generations downstream, the victory of the postwar psychologists in
depoliticizing the critique of racial injustice by shifting its focus
from the social structures that generate and reproduce racial inequality
to an ultimately individual, and ahistorical, domain of "prejudice" or
"intolerance."]{.underline} (No doubt this shift was partly aided by
political imperatives associated with the Cold War and domestic
anticommunism.)

[I've been struck by the level of visceral and vitriolic anti-Marxism
I've seen from this strain of defenders of antiracism as a
politics]{.underline}. It's not clear to me what drives it because it
takes the form of snide dismissals than direct arguments. Moreover, [the
[dismissals]{.mark} typically [include **empty acknowledgment** that "of
course we should oppose capitalism," **whatever that might
mean**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In any event, [[the tenor of this
anti-Marxism is]{.mark} reminiscent of those [right-wing]{.mark}
discourses]{.underline}, many of [which masqueraded as
liberal]{.underline}, in which only invoking the word "Marxism" was
sufficient to dismiss an opposing argument or position.

[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} sort of thing [only [deepens]{.mark} my
suspicions about]{.underline} antiracism's ([[identity
politics']{.underline}]{.mark}) [status [within the **comfort zone of
neoliberalism**]{.mark}'s discourses of "reform."]{.underline} More to
the point, [I suspect as well that this vitriol toward radicalism is
[rooted]{.mark} partly [in the conviction that]{.mark} a left politics
based on [class analysis and]{.mark} one focused on [racial injustice
are Manichean alternatives]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[This should]{.underline}]{.mark} not by any means
[[be]{.underline}]{.mark} interpreted [as a blanket condemnation of
anti-racism, feminism, or other movements for social
equality]{.underline}. [Rather, it should be construed as [a
condemnation of]{.mark} a [politics]{.mark} that is **[centered on
social constructs like race or gender, rather than on material
conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[White supremacy, patriarchy, cisheteronormativity,
ableism]{.underline}]{.mark}, and more [[should]{.mark} specifically [be
seen as what they are]{.mark}]{.underline}[:]{.mark} the social
relations that are created by a white supremacist, patriarchal,
cisheteronormative, ableist system of production --- that is to say
**[[created by capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[[Race and gender must be analyzed in a true intersectional
manner]{.mark}, as **[inextricably linked to the material]{.mark}**
(i.e., economic) **[conditions of which they are
constituted]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

As Reed writes in his 2013 article "Marx, Race, and Neoliberalism,"

[[A Marxist perspective can be]{.mark} most [helpful for understanding
race and racism]{.mark}]{.underline} insofar [[as it perceives
capitalism dialectically]{.mark}, as a social totality that includes
modes of production, relations of production, and the pragmatically
evolving ensemble of institutions and ideologies that lubricate and
propel its reproduction]{.underline}. From this perspective, [Marxism's
most important contribution to making sense of race and racism in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [may be
**demystification**]{.underline}. [A historical materialist perspective
should stress that "race"]{.underline} --- which includes "racism," as
one [is unthinkable without the other]{.underline} --- is a historically
specific ideology that emerged, took shape, and has evolved as a
constitutive element within a definite set of social relations anchored
to a particular system of production.

In other words, [we need anti-racist marxism and feminist
marxism]{.underline} (and anti-racist feminist marxism), **[not identity
politics]{.underline}**.

### 1nc link -- afro-pessimism/wilderson

#### Afro-pessimist literature is a product of middle-class neoliberal academia that obfuscates the need for action and is subjected to corporate capture

[[Afro-pess]{.mark}imism in this original sense has reflected a
disastrous approach to, and **[had disastrous consequences for]{.mark}
[Africa]{.mark} and its inhabitants**]{.underline}. [So how can we
understand the bizarre use of this historically loaded term]{.underline}
(complete with its own history of colonial and imperialist exploitation)
by numerous African-American intellectuals and activists? The use of the
term 'Afro-pessimism' is symptomatic of the historical ignorance of the
Afro-pessimist™ (or what Greg Thomas has recently called Afro-pessimism
2.0), whose grasp of African history is about as solid as that of Hegel.
[In its initial iteration, [Afro-pess]{.mark}imism 2.0 (from now on AP™)
[is a product of middle-class academia; a framework]{.mark} either
consciously or subconsciously [created to allow]{.mark} relatively
[well-off academics to view themselves as]{.mark} the most
[discriminated and oppressed]{.mark} people in the world.
**Characterised by misinterpretations and clever appropriations of Black
radicals like Frantz Fanon and Silvia Wynter**, the theories of the AP™
have spilled over into activist circles, contaminating the global
political discourse on race.]{.underline} The central premise of the AP™
is that anti-Black violence is the structuring regime of the modern
world. [Drawing on Orlando Patterson's concept of 'social death', Frank
[Wilderson]{.mark}, arguably the most prominent and controversial AP™
intellectual, [asserts]{.mark} that [the Black condition is not
characterised by]{.mark} oppression or
[exploitation,]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[like]{.mark} that of the Marxist
[proletariat]{.mark} or the (neo)colonial subject]{.underline}**, [but
rather by the distinction between the Human and the Slave]{.underline}.
For Wilderson, the Black is a priori a slave and therefore we cannot
speak of Blackness without reference to the Slaveness that constitutes
it on an ontological level. In his essay 'Ante-Anti-Blackness:
Afterthoughts', fellow University of California professor Jared Sexton
argues that the condition of the Black/Slave is a state of total
powerlessness, natal alienation ('the loss of ties of birth in both
ascending and descending generations') and generalised dishonour. In
short, Black existence is an ontological absence of sorts, and the
Black/Slave is a living dead (non-entity) in the modern world. In 'The
Black Liberation Army and the Paradox of Political Engagement',
Wilderson offers some further meditations on the concept of 'social
death', explaining that 'the point of social death is a condition, void,
not of land, but of a capacity to secure relational status through
transindividual objects -- be those objects elaborated by land, labour
or love'. Unlike colonial racisms perpetuated by the rational systems of
white supremacy, neo-colonialism or imperialism, or women's oppression
and exploitation driven by patriarchy and capitalism's need for
reproductive labour, anti-Black violence is humanity's irrational desire
for violence against Black people. As Wilderson declares in an interview
with C. S. Soong, 'violence against Black people is a mechanism for the
usurpation of subjectivity, of life of being'. What settlers wanted from
Indians is land, so they killed Indians 'in the main' to get it, whereas
what non-Blacks want from Blacks is not land but 'being'. Anti-Blackness
is thus qualitatively different from the regimes of violence that affect
the Marxist proletariat; or the non-Black person of colour; or the
non-Black woman; or the non-Black woman of colour; or (as Wilderson has
famously claimed) Palestinians. Black suffering is incomparable and
unique: to speak of any experience of oppression without reference to
the ontological disparities between Black/non-Black people is ultimately
an act of 'anti-Blackness'. [But what exactly is it about the makeup of
modern society that displaces the Black/Slave from the realm of politics
and precludes the articulation of concrete political
demands]{.underline}? For Wilderson and Sexton, the very foundations of
political discourse are inherently anti-Black. Or, to put it in terms of
Giorgio Agamben's political ontology (of which the AP™ are rather fond),
the political -- i.e. the ontological character of a political situation
that separates it from other social actions -- or what he calls 'the
Symbolic Order', is skewed against the Black/Slave. The Symbolic Order
is based on the recognition of the 'other's' humanity, which then
enables this 'other' to challenge the order on the grounds of, for
instance, political economy. Since the Black is a priori a Slave, and
Blackness and Slaveness are coterminous, the Black/Slave cannot
participate in the Symbolic Order as her status is not that of the
Human. And because the category of humanity is founded and relies on the
existence of the slave, there is no way the Black/Slave can ever gain
the recognition required to assert political demands and identities in
the realm of the Symbolic Order. It is for this reason that, as Sexton
points out in his essay 'The Social Life of Social Death: On
Afro-Pessimism and Black Optimism', we must posit a 'political ontology
dividing the Slave from the world of the Human in a constitutive way'
and take this as our analytical starting point. [Wilderson's and
Sexton's work contributes to a wider debate on the nature of Black
studies in the United States, which is frequently tied into discussions
on Black performance art, evidenced by the titles of Wilderson's Red,
White and Black: Cinema and the Structure of US
Antagonisms]{.underline}, Kara Keeling's The Witch's Flight: The
Cinematic, the Black Femme, and the Image of Common Sense or Fred
Moten's essays on Black Operations/Black Optimism in musical
performance. [Despite various disagreements and differences among these
scholars, they are united by the common interest in 'the afterlife of
slavery']{.underline} -- first described by Saidiya Hartman in her 2006
memoir Lose Your Mother. For Hartman -- whose project is not that of AP™
and should not be mistaken for this essay's target -- official abolition
in the United States did not engender a decisive break with the
racialised violence of slavery; in contemporary society, we can see
traces of such violence in the 'skewed life chances, limited access to
health and education, premature death, incarceration, and
impoverishment' of African-Americans. The 'afterlife of slavery' she
describes constitutes Black studies' object, and loosely ties a range of
scholars together into a coherent discourse. [It is worth briefly
considering Fred Moten's work to understand the AP™'s ability to co-opt
or usurp other approaches to Black Studies and activism]{.underline}.
Moten attempted to counter the AP™ conception of social death by
foregrounding Black agency and asserting that it is ontologically prior
to the all-encompassing anti-Blackness of the modern world. In the
unpublished paper 'Black Optimism/Black Operation', Moten attempts to
counter the 'anti-essentialism' of radical discourses that disavow Black
studies' own object i.e. Blackness. For Moten, this Blackness exists in
what he (along with his frequent collaborator Stefano Harney) has
famously called 'the undercommons' -- a space outside of official social
structures, where Black people can assert their 'right to refuse'. [But
as Annie Olaloku-Teriba points out in her excellent critique
'Afro-Pessimism and the (Un)Logic of Anti-Blackness', the AP™ finds a
'comfortable antagonist' in Moten, whose Black Ops can be neatly
reintegrated into the concept of social death.]{.underline} [It is also
telling that Sexton, in 'Ante-Anti-Blackness', rather successfully
merges the AP™ conception of social death with Moten's Black
Ops]{.underline} by arguing that: A living death is as much a death as
it is living. Nothing in Afro-pessimism suggests that there is no black
(social) life, only that black life is not social life in the universe
formed by the codes of state and civil society, of citizen and subject,
of nation and culture, of people and place, of history and heritage, of
all the things that colonial society has in common with the colonised,
of all the things that capital has in common with labour -- the modern
world system. Sexton shows that Moten's Black Ops is nothing other than
what he instead calls 'the social life of social death'. There is no
either/or distinction between social life and social death: we can think
both together by positing that Black life is lived in the underground.
Moten even acknowledges, in 'Blackness and Nothingness (Mysticism in the
Flesh)', that the AP™ and Black Ops are engaged in the same theoretical
project: In the end, though life and optimism are the terms under which
I speak, I agree with Sexton -- by way of the slightest most
immeasurable reversal of emphasis -- that Afro-pessimism and black
optimism are not but nothing other than one another. I will continue to
prefer the black optimism of his work just as, I am sure, he will
continue to prefer the Afro-pessimism of mine. For both Afro-pessimists
and Black Optimists, the afterlife of slavery is characterised by the
social death of the Black/Slave and a heavily distorted version of
Fanon's concept of the 'fact of blackness'. This assumption, however,
precludes the participation of Black Ops in radical politics and
confines resistance to spaces of Black performance art. [[By]{.mark}
[confining Black resistance]{.mark} to spaces [outside of the anti-Black
structures of civil society, and by undercutting the possibility for
anti-imperialist solidarity]{.mark} between racialised people across the
world]{.underline}, **[the AP™ [theories have opened]{.mark} up [a space
for]{.mark} the [corporate capture]{.mark} of Blackness]{.underline}**.
[We need only [recall]{.mark} last year's [Nike campaign]{.mark},
prominently [featuring]{.mark} the face of former NFL quarterback Colin
[Kaepernick]{.mark}, who has been blackballed by the league for kneeling
during the national anthem.]{.underline} Since the incident, he has
taken on the role of radical Black activist, complete with Panther-esque
leather jackets, an afro and Afrocentric jewellery. [While Kaepernick's
struggle against the racist and exploitative NFL owners and executives
is, of course, legitimate and necessary, **[the co-opt]{.mark}ation [of
his]{.mark} [struggle]{.mark} by a large corporation [is]{.mark}
certainly a [cause for concern]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Nike is
notorious for its use of sweatshop labour]{.underline} (including both
forced and child labour), [and its history of exploitative labour
practices has been well-documented throughout the years.]{.underline}
[By detaching the struggles of African-Americans from those of
racialised workers in the Global South, Nike can present itself as a
progressive vehicle for Black emancipatory politics, while completely
sidelining the plight of non-white workers outside of the
US.]{.underline} Here we might recall a powerful statement by Fred
Hampton to illustrate just how far from revolutionary Black politics we
find ourselves: [We [don't]{.mark} think you [fight fire with
fire]{.mark} best; we think you fight fire with water best.]{.underline}
[[We're going to fight racism]{.mark} not [with]{.mark} racism, but
we're going to fight with [solidarity]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[We say
[we're not going to fight capitalism with black
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [but [we're going to fight it
with]{.mark} socialism \[...\] We're going to fight \[...\] with all of
us people getting together and **having [an international proletarian
revolution.]{.mark}** [Wilderson and Sexton have been captured by
corporate interests]{.mark} in much the same way.]{.underline} In their
case, however, [[it is not a l]{.mark}arge [corporation]{.mark} that
co-opts Blackness, **[but rather the neoliberal
university]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Is it at all surprising that [two
professors]{.mark} working within the prestigious University of
California system [promote a]{.mark} theoretical
fra[mework]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[that requires no political
action]{.mark} from Black writers and activists [other than]{.mark}
simply [being Black]{.mark}]{.underline}**? [Not only is [AP]{.mark}™ a
product of the neoliberal university, it also [promotes its authors
survival and flourishing within the corporate structures]{.mark} of
higher education]{.underline}. When asked about his framework for
psychological and physical resistance by the hosts of iMiXWHATiLiKE,
[[Wilderson]{.mark} neatly [dodges any commitment]{.mark} to radical
politics [with the excuse that it could cost him his]{.mark} academic
[job]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is so much a part of what it means to be
a professor. I feel like cussing people out all the time. But if I do, I
violate University of California's civility laws, tenure or not I'm out
the door, right? And that tempers my speech. So, I think that what I
have to offer is not a way out. What I have to offer is an analysis of
the problem. And I don't trust me as much as I trust Black people on the
ground. [Wilderson is aware that the AP™ rely on their activist
supporters and social media following to maintain their privileged
position within the university -- without the activists and organisers
on the ground, the AP™ could not prove the market value of its work to
the neoliberal institution]{.underline}. [By creating a framework for
the analysis of race that lends itself to co-optation by corporate
interests]{.underline}, **[the [AP]{.mark}™ has certainly demonstrated
that it [can convert Blackness into profit]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [All
the [while]{.mark}, these [theorists delude themselves]{.mark} that
[they are spearheading a]{.mark} truly radical Black
[movement]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the introduction to a collection of
essays on AP™, the editors (who presumably include Sexton and Wilderson)
even have the audacity to claim that they are 'motivated by a desire to
contribute to \[...\] bringing these writings out of the ivory towers of
the academy' and that they wish to 'remove the materials from this
sitting place and see them proliferate among those in the streets and
prisons'. True, [they have succeeded in disseminating a watered-down
version of their musings to activists and organisers; but what they have
passed on is nothing short of anti-Black, in the sense that it works
against the true liberation of Black people of all classes.
[Today]{.mark}, such [Blackness]{.mark} (and the pseudo-politics that is
attached to it) [is more useful for academic promotions]{.mark},
Instagram hashtags, and Nike adverts than for any revolutionary or
emancipatory politics worthy of the name.]{.underline} **[[The people
who]{.mark} truly [benefit]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- or rather profit --
from the AP™ brand [**[are the academics and]{.mark} the various
[university presses ]{.mark}**and journals who jump at every opportunity
to unleash a plethora of AP™ books and articles onto the academic book
market.]{.underline} [While the AP™ may seem like a niche theoretical
discourse, its influence extends far beyond the university: as
Olaloku-Teriba argues, the AP™'s theoretical framework provides 'the
structuring logic of various political formations in the era of
#BlackLivesMatter'.]{.underline} What is at stake in the debate,
therefore, is nothing less than the possibility of a revolutionary Black
politics. [Maybe African-Americans on the streets or in prison would do
well to reach for George Jackson's Soledad Brother and steer clear of
the AP™ and Black Ops.]{.underline}

#### Framing politics around the gratuitous violence of racism blocks recognition of political economy---this entrenches neoliberal ideology and overlooks class antagonism

**Reed 2013** -- professor of political science at the University of
Pennsylvania, specializing in race and American politics. He has taught
at Yale, Northwestern and the New School for Social Research. An expert
on racial and economic inequality, he is a founding member of the Labor
Party and a frequent contributor to The Nation (2/25, Adolph, Nonsite,
"Django Unchained, or, The Help: How "Cultural Politics" Is Worse Than
No Politics at All, and Why",
http://nonsite.org/feature/django-unchained-or-the-help-how-cultural-politics-is-worse-than-no-politics-at-all-and-why)

In both films the bogus happy endings are possible only because they
characterize their respective regimes of racial hierarchy in the
superficial terms of interpersonal transactions. In *The Help*
segregationism's evil was small-minded bigotry and lack of sensitivity;
it was more like bad manners than oppression. [[In Tarantino's vision,
slavery's definitive injustice was its **gratuitous**]{.mark} and
sadistic [brutalization]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}and sexualized
degradation. [Malevolent, ludicrously arrogant whites owned slaves most
conspicuously to degrade and torture them.]{.underline} Apart from
serving a formal dinner in a plantation house---and Tarantino, the
Chance the Gardener of American filmmakers (and Best Original
Screenplay? Really?) seems to draw his images of plantation life from
Birth of a Nation and Gone With the Wind, as well as old Warner Brothers
cartoons---and the Mandingo fighters and comfort girls, [[Tarantino's
slaves do no actual work]{.mark} at all; [they're present only to be
brutalized]{.mark}. In fact, [the cavalier sadism]{.mark} with which
owners and traders treat them [belies the fact that slaves were, **first
and foremost, capital investments.** It's not for nothing that New
Orleans has]{.mark} a monument to the estimated 20,000-[30,000]{.mark}
antebellum [Irish immigrants who died constructing the]{.mark} New Basin
[Canal; slave labor was **too valuable** for such lethal
work]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[*The Help* trivializes Jim Crow by reducing it to its most
superficial]{.underline} features [and irrational extremes. The
[master-servant]{.mark} nexus was]{.underline}, and [[is, a labor
relation. And the problem]{.underline}]{.mark} of labor relations
[particular to the segregationist regime [wasn't]{.mark} employers'
[bigoted]{.mark} lack of respect or [failure to hear]{.mark} the [voices
]{.mark}]{.underline}of the domestic servants, or even benighted refusal
to recognize their equal humanity. [[It was]{.mark} that [the labor
relation]{.mark} was structured within and sustained by a political and
institutional order [that]{.mark} severely [impinged
on]{.mark},]{.underline} when it didn't altogether deny[, black
citizens' avenues for [pursuit of grievances and standing before the
law. The]{.mark} crucial [lynchpin ]{.mark}]{.underline}of that order
[[was neither myopia nor malevolence; it was suppression of]{.mark}
black]{.underline} citizens' capacities for direct participation in
civic and [[political life, with]{.mark} racial
[disfranchisement]{.mark} and the constant threat of terror]{.underline}
intrinsic to substantive denial of equal protection and due process
before the law [[as its]{.mark} principal
[mechanisms]{.mark}]{.underline}. [And the point of the regime wasn't
racial hatred or enforced disregard; [its roots lay in the **much more
prosaic concern** of]{.mark} dominant [elites to maintain]{.mark} their
political and [economic heg]{.mark}emony [by suppressing]{.mark}
potential [opposition]{.mark} and in]{.underline} the linked ideal of
maintaining access to [a labor force with no options but to accept
employment on whatever terms employers offered.]{.underline} (Those who
liked *The Help* or found it moving should watch *The Long Walk Home*, a
1990 film set in Montgomery, Alabama, around the bus boycott. I suspect
that's the film you thought you were watching when you saw The Help.)

[*Django Unchained* trivializes slavery by reducing it to its most
barbaric and lurid excesses. Slavery]{.underline} also [was
fundamentally a labor relation. It was a form of forced labor
regulated]{.underline}---systematized, enforced and sustained---[through
a political and institutional order that specified it as a civil
relationship granting owners absolute control]{.underline} over the
life, liberty, and fortunes of others defined as eligible for
enslavement, including most of all control of the conditions of their
labor and appropriation of its product. [Historian]{.underline} Kenneth
M. [[Stampp quotes a slaveholder's]{.mark} succinct
[explanation:]{.mark} "'For what purpose does the master hold the
servant]{.underline}?' asked an ante-bellum Southerner. ['[Is it not
that by his labor, he]{.mark}, the master, [may accumulate
wealth?'"]{.mark}1]{.underline}

[[That]{.underline}]{.mark} absolute control [[permitted]{.mark}
horrible]{.underline}, unthinkable [[brutality,]{.mark} to be
sure,]{.underline} **[[but]{.mark} perpetrating [such]{.mark} brutality
[was neither the point of slavery nor its essential
injustice]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The master-slave relationship could,
and did, exist without brutality, and certainly without sadism and
sexual degradation. In Tarantino's depiction, however, it is not clear
that slavery shorn of its extremes of brutality would be objectionable.
[[It does not diminish]{.mark} the historical [injustice]{.mark} and
horror of slavery [to note that it was **not** ]{.mark}**the product of
*[sui generis]{.mark}*, transcendent [Evil but a]{.mark} terminus on a
[continuum of bound labor]{.mark}** [that was more norm than exception
]{.mark}]{.underline}in the Anglo-American world until well into the
eighteenth century, if not later. As legal historian Robert Steinfeld
points out, [[it is]{.mark} not so much slavery, but]{.underline} the
emergence of [[the notion of free labor---]{.mark}as the absolute
control of a worker over her person---that is the historical anomaly
[that needs to be explained]{.mark}.2 *[Django]{.mark} Unchained*
[sanitizes the]{.mark} essential [injustice]{.mark} of slavery by not
problematizing it and [by **focusing instead** on the]{.mark} extremes
of [brutality]{.mark} and degradation [it
permitted]{.mark}]{.underline}, to the extent of making some of them up,
just as does *The Help* regarding Jim Crow.

*The Help* could not imagine a more honest and complex view of
segregationist Mississippi partly because it uses the period ultimately
as a prop for human interest cliché, and *Django Unchained*'s absurdly
ahistorical view of plantation slavery is only backdrop for the merger
of spaghetti western and blaxploitation hero movie. [Neither film is
really about the period in which it is set. Film critic Manohla Dargis,
reflecting a decade ago on what she saw as a growing Hollywood penchant
for period films, observed that such films are typically "stripped of
politics and historical fact]{.underline}...and instead will find
meaning in appealing to seemingly timeless ideals and stirring scenes of
love, valor and compassion" and that "the Hollywood professionals who
embrace accuracy most enthusiastically nowadays are costume designers."3
That observation applies to both these films, although in *Django*
concern with historically accurate representation of material culture
applies only to the costumes and props of the 1970s film genres
Tarantino wants to recall.

To make sense of how *Django Unchained* has received so much warmer a
reception among black and leftoid commentators than did *The Help*, it
is useful to recall Margaret Thatcher's 1981 dictum that "economics are
the method: the object is to change the soul."4 Simply put, she and her
element have won. [Few observers---among opponents and boosters
alike---have noted how deeply and thoroughly both films are embedded in
the practical ontology of neoliberalism]{.underline}, the complex of
unarticulated assumptions and unexamined first premises that provide its
common sense, its lifeworld.

Objection to *The Help* has been largely of the shooting fish in a
barrel variety: complaints about the film's paternalistic treatment of
the maids, which generally have boiled down to an objection that the
master-servant relation is thematized at all, as well as the standard,
predictable litany of anti-racist charges about whites speaking for
blacks, the film's inattentiveness to the fact that at that time in
Mississippi black people were busily engaged in liberating themselves,
etc. An illustration of this tendency that conveniently refers to
several other variants of it is Akiba Solomon, "Why I'm Just Saying No
to 'The Help' and Its Historical Whitewash" in Color Lines,August 10,
2011, available
at:http://colorlines.com/archives/2011/08/why_im_just_saying_no_to_the_help.html.

[[Defenses]{.mark} of *Django Unchained* [pivot on claims about
the]{.mark} social [significance ]{.mark}]{.underline}of the narrative
[[of a black hero.]{.mark}]{.underline} One node of [[this argument
emphasizes]{.mark} the need to validate]{.underline} a history of
[autonomous black agency and ["resistance" as]{.mark} a
politico-existential [desideratum]{.mark}. It]{.underline} accommodates
a view that [stresses the importance of recognition of
rebellious]{.underline} [or militant]{.underline}
[individuals]{.underline} [and revolts]{.underline} in black American
history. [Another centers on a notion that exposure to fictional black
heroes can inculcate the sense of personal efficacy necessary to
overcome [the]{.mark} psychological effects of inequality]{.underline}
and to facilitate upward mobility and may undermine some whites'
negative stereotypes about black people. In either register [assignment
of social or political]{.underline} [[importance]{.underline}]{.mark} to
depictions of black heroes [[rests on]{.mark} presumptions
about]{.underline} the nexus of mass [[cultural
representation]{.underline}]{.mark}, social commentary, and racial
justice [that are more significant politically than the controversy
about the film itself]{.underline}. In both versions, [this argument
casts political and **economic problems in psychological
terms**]{.underline}. Injustice appears as a matter of disrespect and
denial of due recognition, and [[the remedies]{.underline}]{.mark}
proposed---[which are all about images projected]{.underline} and the
distribution of jobs associated with their projection---[[look]{.mark} a
lot [like self-esteem engineering. Moreover, nothing could indicate
more]{.mark} strikingly the extent of [neolib]{.mark}eral ideological
hegemony [than the idea that]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}the mass
culture industry and its [[representational practices constitute a
**meaningful terrain for struggle**]{.underline} ]{.mark}to advance
egalitarian interests. [It is possible to entertain that
view]{.underline} seriously [only by ignoring]{.underline} the fact
[that [the production and consumption of]{.mark} mass [culture is
thoroughly embedded in capitalist]{.mark} material and ideological
[imperatives]{.mark}.]{.underline}

That, incidentally, is why I prefer the usage "mass culture" to describe
this industry and its products and processes, although I recognize that
it may seem archaic to some readers. The mass culture v. popular culture
debate dates at least from the 1950s and has continued with occasional
crescendos ever since.5 For two decades or more, instructively in line
with the retreat of possibilities for concerted left political action
outside the academy, the popular culture side of that debate has been
dominant, along with its view that the products of this precinct of mass
consumption capitalism are somehow capable of transcending or subverting
their material identity as commodities, if not avoiding that identity
altogether. [[Despite]{.mark} the dogged
[commitment]{.mark}]{.underline} [[o]{.mark}f]{.underline} several
generations of American Studies and cultural studies [[graduate students
who want]{.underline} [to valorize]{.underline}]{.mark} watching
[television and immersion in]{.underline} [[hip-hop or]{.mark}
other]{.underline} [[specialty]{.underline}]{.mark} market
[[niches]{.underline}]{.mark} centered on youth recreation and the most
ephemeral fads [[as]{.mark} both [intellectually avant-garde and
politically "resistive,"]{.mark} it should be time to admit [that
]{.mark}]{.underline}that earnest disposition [[is **intellectually
shallow** ]{.mark}**and an [ersatz politics]{.mark}**[. The
idea]{.mark}]{.underline} of "popular" culture [[posits a
spurious]{.mark} autonomy and [organicism that actually affirm]{.mark}
mass [industrial processes by effacing them, especially in]{.mark} the
[putatively rebel]{.mark}, fringe, or underground market [niches that
**depend on** ]{.mark}**the fiction of [the authentic]{.mark}** [to
announce ]{.mark}]{.underline}the birth of [[new product
cycles.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The power of the hero is a cathartic trope]{.underline} that connects
mainly with the sensibility of adolescent boys---of whatever nominal
age. [Tarantino]{.underline} has allowed as much, responding to black
critics' complaints about the violence and copious use of "nigger" by
proclaiming "Even for the film's biggest detractors, I think their
children will grow up and love this movie. I think it could become a
rite of passage for young black males."6 This response stems no doubt
from Tarantino's arrogance and opportunism, and some critics have
denounced it as no better than racially presumptuous. But he [is hardly
alone in defending the film with an assertion that it gives black youth
heroes, is generically inspirational or both]{.underline}. Similarly, in
a January 9, 2012 interview on the Daily Show, George Lucas adduced this
line to promote his even more execrable race-oriented live-action
cartoon, *Red Tails*, which, incidentally, trivializes segregation in
the military by reducing it to a matter of bad or outmoded attitudes.
The ironic effect is significant understatement of both the obstacles
the Tuskegee airmen faced and their actual accomplishments by rendering
them as backdrop for a blackface, slapped-together remake of *Top Gun*.
(Norman Jewison's 1984 film, *A Soldier's Story*, adapted from Charles
Fuller's *A Soldier's Play*, is a much more sensitive and
thought-provoking rumination on the complexities of race and racism in
the Jim Crow U.S. Army---an army mobilized, as my father, a veteran of
the Normandy invasion, never tired of remarking sardonically, to fight
the racist Nazis.) Lucas characterized his film as "patriotic, even
jingoistic" and was explicit that he wanted to create a film that would
feature "real heroes" and would be "inspirational for teenage boys."
Much as *Django Unchained*'s defenders compare it on those terms
favorably to *Lincoln*, Lucas hyped *Red Tails* as being a genuine hero
story unlike "*Glory*, where you have a lot of white officers running
those guys into cannon fodder."

Of course, the film industry is sharply tilted toward the youth market,
as Lucas and Tarantino are acutely aware. But Lucas, unlike Tarantino,
was not being defensive in asserting his desire to inspire the young; he
offered it more as a boast. As he has said often, he'd wanted for years
to make a film about the Tuskegee airmen, and he reports that he always
intended telling their story as a feel-good, crossover inspirational
tale. Telling it that way also fits in principle (though in this
instance not in practice, as *Red Tails* bombed at the box office) with
the commercial imperatives of increasingly degraded mass entertainment.
Dargis observed that the ahistoricism of the recent period films is
influenced by market imperatives in a global film industry. The more a
film is tied to historically specific contexts, the more difficult it is
to sell elsewhere. That logic selects for special effects-driven
products as well as standardized, decontextualized and
simplistic---"universal"---story lines, preferably set in fantasy worlds
of the filmmakers' design. As Dargis notes, these films find their
meaning in shopworn clichés puffed up as timeless verities, including
uplifting and inspirational messages for youth. But something else
underlies the stress on inspiration in the black-interest films, which
shows up in critical discussion of them as well.

All [[these]{.mark} films]{.underline}---*The Help, Red Tails, Django
Unchained*, even *Lincoln* and *Glory*---[make a [claim]{.mark} to
public attention based partly on their social [significance
beyond]{.mark} entertainment or [art, and]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}they do so [[because they engage]{.mark} with]{.underline}
significant moments in the history of [[the nexus of race and
politics]{.underline}]{.mark} in the United States. There would not be
so much discussion and debate and no Golden Globe, NAACP Image, or
Academy Award nominations for *The Help*, *Red Tails*, or *Django
Unchained* if those films weren't defined partly by thematizing that
nexus of race and politics in some way.

[The pretensions to social significance]{.underline} that fit these
films into their particular market niche [don't conflict with the
mass-market]{.underline} film [industry's imperative of infantilization
because those pretensions are only part of the show; they are little
more than empty bromides, product differentiation in the patter of
"seemingly timeless ideals" which the mass entertainment industry
constantly recycles]{.underline}. (Andrew O'Hehir observes as much about
*Django Unchained*, which he describes as "a three-hour trailer for a
movie that never happens."7) That comes through in the defense of these
films, in the face of evidence of their failings, that, after all, they
are "just entertainment." [[Their]{.mark} substantive [content is
ideological; it is their contribution to]{.mark} the naturalization of
[neoliberalism's]{.mark} ontology as they propagandize its
[universalization across]{.mark} spatial, [temporal, and]{.mark} [social
contexts]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Purportedly in the interest of popular education cum entertainment,
*Django Unchained* and *The Help*, and *Red Tails* for that matter, read
the sensibilities of the present into the past by divesting the latter
of its specific historicity. [They reinforce the sense of the past as
generic old-timey times distinguishable from the present by superficial
inadequacies]{.underline}---outmoded fashion, technology, commodities
and ideas---since overcome. In *The Help* Hilly's obsession with her pet
project marks segregation's petty apartheid as irrational in part
because of the expense rigorously enforcing it would require; the
breadwinning husbands express their frustration with it as financially
impractical. Hilly is a mean-spirited, narrow-minded person whose rigid
and tone-deaf commitment to segregationist consistency not only reflects
her limitations of character but also is economically unsound, a fact
that further defines her, and the cartoon version of Jim Crow she
represents, as irrational.

[[The deeper message]{.underline}]{.mark} of these films, insofar as
they deny the integrity of the past, [[is that there is **no thinkable
alternative to the** ]{.mark}**ideological [order under which we
live]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This message is reproduced throughout the
mass entertainment industry; [it shapes the normative reality even of
the fantasy worlds that masquerade as escapism. Even among those who
laud the supposedly cathartic effects of Django's insurgent violence as
reflecting a greater truth of abolition than passage of the Thirteenth
Amendment, few commentators notice that he and Broomhilda attained their
freedom through a market transaction]{.underline}.8 [This reflects an
ideological hegemony in which students all too commonly wonder why
planters would deny slaves or sharecroppers education because education
would have made them more productive as workers]{.underline}. And,
tellingly, in a glowing rumination in [[the Daily
Kos]{.underline}]{.mark}, Ryan Brooke [[inadvertently thrusts]{.mark}
mass [culture's destruction of historicity into]{.mark} bold [relief
by]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}declaiming on "the segregated society
presented" in *Django Unchained* and [[babbling on---with]{.mark}
the]{.underline} absurdly ill-informed and [pontifical
[self-righteousness]{.mark} that the blogosphere enables---[about our
need to take "responsibility for preserving racial
divides"]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}if we are "to put segregation in
the past and fully fulfill Dr. King's dream."9 It's all an
indistinguishable mush of bad stuff about racial injustice in the
old-timey days[. Decoupled from its moorings in a historically specific
political economy, [slavery becomes]{.mark} at bottom [a problem of race
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [and, as historian]{.underline}
Michael R. [West argues forcefully, "race relations" emerged as and has
remained a discourse [that substitutes etiquette for
equality]{.mark}.]{.underline}10

[[This is]{.underline}]{.mark} the context in which we should take
account of what "inspiring the young" means as a justification for those
films. In part, the claim to inspire is a simple platitude, more filler
than substance. It is, as I've already noted, both an excuse for films
that are cartoons made for an infantilized, generic market and an
assertion of a claim to a particular niche within that market. More
insidiously, though, the ease with which "inspiration of youth" rolls
out in this context resonates with three related and disturbing
themes: 1) underclass ideology's narratives---now all Americans' common
sense---that link poverty and inequality most crucially to (racialized)
cultural inadequacy and psychological damage; 2) [the [belief that
racial inequality stems from]{.mark} prejudice, [bad ideas and]{.mark}
ignorance, and]{.underline} 3) [the cognate of both: [the]{.mark}
neoliberal]{.underline} rendering of social justice as equality of
opportunity, with an [[aspiration of creating "competitive]{.mark}
individual [minority agents]{.mark} who might stand **a better fighting
chance [in the neoliberal rat race rather than a positive
alternative]{.mark} vision [of a society that eliminates the need to
fight constantly against]{.mark} disruptive [market whims]{.mark}** in
the first place]{.underline}."11

This politics seeps through in the chatter about *Django Unchained* in
particular. Erin Aubry Kaplan, in the [[L]{.mark}os
[A]{.mark}ngeles]{.underline} [[Times]{.underline}]{.mark} article in
which Tarantino asserts his appeal to youth, [[remarks that the "most
disturbing detail]{.mark} \[about slavery\] [is the emotional
violence]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}and degradation [directed [at
blacks that]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}effectively [[keeps them at
the bottom of the social order]{.mark}, a place they still occupy
today.]{.underline}" Writing on the Institute of the Black World blog,
one Dr. Kwa David Whitaker, a 1960s-style cultural nationalist, declaims
on Django's testament to the sources of degradation and "unending
servitude \[that\] has rendered \[black Americans\] almost incapable of
making sound evaluations of our current situations or the kind of steps
we must take to improve our condition."12 [[In its blindness to
political economy, this]{.mark} notion of black cultural or
psychological damage as either a legacy of slavery]{.underline} or of
more indirect recent origin---e.g., urban migration, crack epidemic,
matriarchy, babies making babies---[[comports well with]{.mark} the
[reduction]{.mark} of slavery and Jim Crow]{.underline} [[to
interpersonal dynamics]{.mark} and bad attitudes.]{.underline} [[It
**substitutes** ]{.mark}**a "politics of
[recognition"]{.mark}**]{.underline} and a patter of racial uplift [[for
politics]{.mark} and underwrites a conflation of political action and
therapy]{.underline}.

With respect to the nexus of race and inequality, [[this discourse
supports victim-blaming]{.underline}]{.mark} programs of personal
rehabilitation [[and self-esteem engineering]{.mark}---inspiration---[as
easily as]{.mark} it does]{.underline} multiculturalist
[[respect]{.mark} for difference]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}, by
the way, [also feeds back to self-esteem engineering and inspiration as
nodes within a larger political economy of race
relations]{.underline}**.** Either way, [[this]{.mark} is a discourse
that [**displaces a politics** **challenging** ]{.mark}**social
[structures that reproduce inequality ]{.mark}**[with concern for the
feelings]{.mark} and characteristics [of
individuals]{.mark}]{.underline} and of categories of population
statistics reified as singular groups that are equivalent to
individuals. [[This]{.mark} discourse [has made it
possible]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(again, but more sanctimoniously
this time[) [to characterize]{.mark} destruction of low-income housing
as an uplift strategy for poor people; [curtailment of]{.mark} access to
public [education as "choice"; being cut]{.mark} adrift [from]{.mark}
essential social [wage protections as "empowerment"; and individual
]{.mark}]{.underline}material [[success as]{.underline}]{.mark} socially
important [[role modeling]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

[[Neolib]{.mark}eralism's triumph [is affirmed with unselfconscious
clarity]{.mark}]{.underline} in the ostensibly leftist defenses of
*Django Unchained* that center on the theme of slaves' having liberated
themselves. [Trotskyists, would-be anarchists, and psychobabbling
identitarians have their respective sectarian garnishes: [Trotskyists
see everywhere the bugbear of "bureaucratism"]{.mark} and mystify
"self-activity;" [anarchists]{.mark} similarly [fetishize direct

[Despite oppression, exploitation and racial discrimination, the
out-right murder and imprisonment of our peoples by a handful of
racist-imperialist, the Black liberation movement has kept on
pushing]{.underline}, like a powerful train headed for freedom. Through
hundreds of years of unremitting [struggle [the Black liberation
movement has been steadily maturing despite the class forces that have
held]{.mark} the reign of [leadership]{.mark}.]{.underline} [In recent
times [the most important]{.mark} and significant [trend has been
the]{.mark} dramatic [awakening of the Black **working
class**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[in its fight for its own
independent organization and ideological and political leadership of the
Black struggle.]{.underline} [The Black Bourgeoisie]{.underline} (Uncle
Toms) [has already proven to the masses of Black people that it is
incapable of leading the great struggle for Black
emancipation]{.underline}, and not only are these "Toms" incapable of
leading the struggle, [they themselves have proven to be one of **its
mortal enemies.**]{.underline} The main forces of the Black Liberation
movement are the Black proletariat Black youth, revolutionary
intellectuals and students, and other revolutionary nationalists in the
Black community, with the Black proletariat in the lead as the key and
most through going revolutionary class. [[The political task]{.mark} of
the Black liberation movement [is]{.mark} complete [emancipation]{.mark}
of Black people [through a revolutionary union with the entire U.S.
working class, of which it is an important part, to overthrow
cap]{.mark}italism and imperialism in the U.S.]{.underline} In a word,
[**[Black Liberation today means freedom]{.mark} for Black people
[through proletarian revolution]{.mark}.** [Which road should
the]{.mark} Black liberation [struggle travel?]{.mark}
S]{.underline}hould it take the road of Jesse Jackson and "Black
Capitalism"? [[Should it rely on]{.mark} Mr. Muhammad and [Allah's wheel
in the sky]{.mark} to save the Black Masses]{.underline}? Should it take
the "pork chop" road of cultural nationalism -- Immamu Barakaism?
[[Should it dream]{.mark} with Stokely Carmichael [of returning to
Africa]{.mark} to "free Ghana". [Should it take the road of electing the
black Bourgeoisie]{.mark} to puppet, show-front, positions of mayor,
City-councilman, Legislators, and Congressmen]{.underline}? Or should it
take the road of "Pan-Africanism", where the Black masses are asked to
play "first aid" for the liberation struggles in Africa? Of all these
"roads" which one is correct? [[Anyone who takes a serious look]{.mark}
at the world today [cannot help but see that oppressed]{.mark} and
exploited [peoples are]{.mark} locked [in a death-bed struggle
against]{.mark} international [cap]{.mark}italism.]{.underline} [Who can
deny that the major enemy of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America,
are a gang of international imperialist]{.underline}, head by the two
"super-powers" the U.S. and the Soviet Union? Who are the murderers of
the miners of South Africa? The peasants and workers of Vietnam? The
Attica Brothers? The people of Chile? The Indians at Wounded Knee? Who
is responsible for police brutality in Detroit? In Chicago? In Atlanta?
Who benefits from the high price of bread and meat? Who benefits from
the lowest possible wages? Whether we like it or not our position in the
world as an oppressed people does not allow us to follow the bankrupt
road of U.S. imperialism which is heading for its doom. [In the present
international situation, [the Black masses must line up with the]{.mark}
heroic [peoples of the world who have struck blow after blow at
imperialism, or we must line up with the imperialists themselves
who]{.mark} send their puppets into the Black communities to [preach
"Black Capitalism". **There is no third path**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Only the Black proletariat deserves to lead the Black liberation
movement. As far as we are concerned, [none of the other classes in the
Black community can do it. [If none of the bourgeois and **petty
bourgeois "isms" cited above** is capable of lighting the road]{.mark}
for the Black liberation struggle, [then what is?]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}We say it is Marxism-Leninism and the Thought of Mao Tse Tung.
All those who genuinely (in word and deed) take up Marxism-Leninism and
Mao's Thought and put it into practice are communists. Chairman Mao runs
it down like this: "[[Communism]{.mark} is at once a complete system of
proletarian ideology and a new social system. It [is different from any
other ideology]{.mark} and social system, [and is the most]{.mark}
complete, progressive, [revolutionary]{.mark} and rational [system in
human history]{.mark}".]{.underline} (New Democracy) REVOLUTIONARY
IDEOLOGY OF THE MODERN ERA Marxism-Leninism and the Thought of Mao Tse
Tung is the ideology of the working class in the present era. It takes
its name from the great teachers of the working class and
oppressed-Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao Tse Tung. [Without
Marxism-Leninism]{.underline} Mao Tse Tung Thought to guide it, **[the
Black liberation movement cannot possibly be victorious.]{.underline}**
[And whom do we think is most hostile to this ideology, proletarian
ideology? What class and their lap dogs do the most to try and poison
our minds against communism? The very same class that is the cause of
our oppression and exploitation--the imperialist ruling class and their
agents **in the Black Nation.**]{.underline} While constantly preaching
to us about the "horrors and perils of communism", [the imperialist
bourgeoisie and their lackeys in the U.S. have concocted the most insane
arguments possible for the rejection of communist ideology]{.underline}.
Everyone, knows how the bourgeoisie hates everything which hints of
socialism and communism. We are even treated to the spectacle of a
person like 'Senator Eastland' of Mississippi, practically a slaveholder
today, talking about how communism is "bad for the people". What people
is this blood-sucker talking about? Certainly not Black people,
especially those who work on "his" plantation, or even the masses of
white people for that matter. Eastland knows that communism is "bad" for
people like himself, ex-slaveholders and modern imperialists, who
communists and communism seek to wipe off the face of the earth. No, it
is not so difficult to see the motives behind the massive anti-communist
hysteria in the U.S[. The buffoons who really take the cake are those
among us. The Jesse Jacksons, Imamu Barakas]{.underline}, Thomas
Mathews, Stokely Carmichaels, and the jive Black politicians [and
sinister Black capitalists who roam about the Black
community.]{.underline} These people feel that Senator Eastland is not
enough, he needs an echo. After the many years of bitter experience that
Black people have had in this country one would have thought, perhaps,
that when 'massa' says "something is bad for you", that it is likely to
be something good. Malcolm summed it up this way: "There are basically
two kinds of Negroes. The first kind of Negro when he sees his master is
sick he says good, let him die. If he sees his master's house burning
down he prays for a strong wind. He hates his master because he wants to
be free. The other kind of Negro is a fool. He identifies himself with
his master. When the 'massa' wants something, he runs and gets it. When
the master gets sick, he says: "'massa' we sick?" This Negro loves his
master because he wants to stay a slave." So it is today. The Black
Nation is and has always been divided into classes, and each class has
its own "ism", and there are even different groups within the same class
with different "isms." The ruling circles of the U.S. preach that
capitalism is the best of all possible worlds. Black bourgeois forces
echo and mimic the "big" bourgeoisie under the cover of
"assimilationism" "integrationism" and now and then, "back to
Africanism." [[This]{.mark} same [Black bourgeoisie spreads its own form
of nationalism]{.mark}, "bourgeois nationalism." Mr. Muhammad talks
about meeting Allah on a street corner]{.underline} in Detroit one cold
winter day. Therefore, [[Islamism is the road to freedom]{.mark} and
salvation]{.underline}, [even [though it hasn't served the Arabs]{.mark}
too [well]{.mark} in. the Middle East; in **fact it hinders their
liberation**.]{.underline} And there is the "Black 'Christian
Nationalism" of certain Black preachers who are trying to convince us
how "revolutionary" Christianity can be if you only paint Jesus Black!
And then there's Imamu Baraka (Swahili for "high priest") who loves to
enlighten us by calling Marxism-Leninism "a honky thing." There is the
"Pan-Africanism" of the Black bourgeois and petty bourgeois classes who
want to fight the U.S. and Portugal in Africa, but who don't want to
fight the rulers of the U.S. and Portugal who live in the United States
and who murder Black people right under their noses! And they do this
without the blessings of the African revolutionaries who have
consistently told them that the best way to help Africa become free and
independent is to take up the struggle against U.S. imperialism right
inside the U.S.A. Additionally, the Black bourgeois and petty bourgeois
classes have the many other "isms" of 'cultural nationalism',
communalism, 'lumpenism', and etc., etc., etc.. [Since there are so many
"isms" in the Black community representing the interests of the Black
bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, what is wrong with the Black
proletariat having Communism for its ideology, since it is the one
ideology which doesn't rely on magic, and the one ideology standing up
to the imperialists of the world, and the one ideology which has changed
the material conditions for over a billion of the world's
people]{.underline}? [Clearly it is the only ideology leading people to
their liberation in the modern era]{.underline}. When Imamu Baraka
claims that Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tse Tung Thought is a "Honky Thing",
what is he really saying? Is he saying that the millions of dead
Vietnamese workers and peasants who were guided by this outlook were
dying in the interest of a "honky thing?" Is he saying that the great
Chinese revolution was led by a "honky thing?" Or maybe he is saying
that the great TANZAM Railway Project' which is being built through
Zambia and Tanzania, with the fraternal aid of the Chinese, is a "honky
thing" project. [[The entire international anti-imperialist united
front]{.mark} today [depends on the international proletariat]{.mark}
and its ideology of Marxism-Leninism and the Thought of Mao Tse Tung as
a guiding light and an unshakable force. For]{.underline} Imamu Baraka
and his like to reject Marxism-Leninism means they are rejecting the
leading role of the Black proletariat in the Black liberation movement,
and in the final analysis, selling out the Black liberation movement
altogether. Despite their phrase-mongering, [people like Baraka cannot
possibly have the interests of the Black Nation at heart. [These
elements]{.mark} like Baraka himself, [accuse us communists of "dividing
Black people along class lines,"]{.mark} "keeping us from all uniting as
one," etc. [But]{.mark} they are wrong. [It is not]{.mark} us
[communists who "divide Black people along class lines," but the
objective development of society itself]{.mark}]{.underline}. Booker T.
Washington preceded the Bolshevik Revolution by fifty years! Whether we
like it or not, [[class divisions]{.mark} exist in the Black community
and they [will not, be "wished" away by rhetoric, only by]{.mark} the
establishment of world communism and [a classless society]{.mark}. Black
magic just will not do!]{.underline}

#### Class struggle is a better framework to address gratuitous violence, even if it's not sufficient---we have empirical support for our method and a better explanation for patterns like segregation and police brutality

**Camp and Kelley 13** \[Jordan, visiting scholar in the Institute of
American Cultures and the Bunche Center for African American Studies at
UCLA, and Robin, PhD in History, Professor of American History at UCLA,

Camp [[What is to be learned from the A]{.mark}labama [C]{.mark}ommunist
[P]{.mark}arty's organizing around unemployment]{.underline},
homelessness, evictions, [and foreclosures]{.underline} during the
period you call "the underground," 1929--1935? Kelley Some of their
lessons are ones they learned in the process by making mistakes. For
example, [the traditional way of organizing was mass
protest]{.underline}. They had some demonstrations---one attracted as
many as five thousand people in 1933. [But mass protests were not the
most effective forms of organizing. The most effective ones were
invisible.]{.underline} That is why that chapter is called "an invisible
army." [[People were being evicted]{.mark} constantly. [The
Chicago]{.mark}]{.underline}, Detroit, New York, [and Los Angeles
[approach was to confront the police]{.mark} in a]{.underline} kind of
[street theater [to say "we are]{.mark} the Communist Party we are
[going to put the furniture back in the house]{.mark} after you've been
evicted]{.underline}. We are going to challenge the police who are
putting the furniture out, if we can't convince the police to let you
stay there." This street theater was not just to put people back in
their homes but also to recruit new members. That is why those scenes
were so dramatic. [[In Alabama]{.mark} they couldn't do that. [What they
would do is]{.mark}]{.underline} quietly [[approach the
owner]{.underline}]{.mark} of the house being rented [[and say,
"Well]{.mark} look]{.underline}, we really hope that you can let that
person come back to the house, because [[if it is empty I can
guarantee]{.mark} you by the next morning [the house is going to be
firewood. People are]{.mark} so [desperate for fuel]{.mark} they will
tear down your house piece by piece]{.underline}. I'll tell you what,
[[why don't you pay the person]{.underline}]{.mark} a dollar a month
[[to take care of your house rather than throw them out?" That worked.
Or when people's electricity was cut off, the]{.mark} Communist [Party
would show up with jumper cables and hook it up to public
utilities]{.mark} to make sure people had electricity.]{.underline} Camp
Can you describe the role of the Communist Party in the mobilizations
around the Scottsboro case and the Angelo Herndon case, a black labor
organizer whom James Baldwin calls the "George Jackson of the era"?5
Kelley [[Angelo Herndon]{.mark} actually cut his teeth in Alabama as a
Communist. He was one of the first rural organizers]{.underline}. He was
a veteran when he was arrested on\[End Page 219\] this old bogus
conspiracy law in Georgia. The Herndon case became a kind of cause
célèbre because [he [was incarcerated on trumped-up charges of
conspiracy as a leading black Communist. The Party took]{.mark} what
looked like [a local incident and made it an international
scandal]{.mark}]{.underline}. Everyone knew Angelo Herndon's name. [You
could walk around [Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline}, Johannesburg, and
Peking, [and they [knew]{.mark} Angelo Herndon [because the]{.mark}
Communist [Party put the word out. Similarly, the Scottsboro case was
one in which the Party's international links made]{.mark} what was
essentially a local]{.underline} common [case---meaning that many black
men have been "legally lynched" for being accused of raping]{.underline}
or attempting to rape white women[---[a scandal]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Nine young men, almost all minors, were just riding in a freight car
"hoboing" and looking for work. Two white women were also on the train.
They were forced to cry rape in some ways by the police. It is very
probable that [[had it not been for the]{.mark} Communist [Party, the
Scottsboro boys would have been executed]{.mark}]{.underline} or
lynched. [[It is significant that]{.mark} the Alabama [Communists
basically defined a class war prisoner]{.mark}]{.underline} or political
prisoner [[as any black person arrested under this unjust
system]{.mark}. As a result, a number of]{.underline} rape
[cases]{.underline} and lynchings [were made]{.underline} into
[international]{.underline} cause célèbres. One of the tragedies is that
there was another case of a young twelve-year-old woman Murdis Dixon,
who was raped and beaten by a white man. The Communist Party stepped in
and said, here is another case that we need to step in on and bring to
the attention of the world. Unfortunately the Party leadership didn't
take up her case. The Garveyites took up her case and tried to make
something out of it, but it was a real failure. Not just a failure,
because it also spoke ideologically to one of the problems that the
Party had. That is, at the national level at least, the value of black
women as a whole was not as great as that of white women or black men.
That is one of the lessons that I took from the case. I don't fault the
local Communists per se because they were the ones who investigated and
tried to make it a story. They ran the story in the Southern Worker, but
nothing else happened after that. Camp [[What are the stakes]{.mark}
involved [in understanding]{.mark} the role of [white supremacy and
anticommunism in crushing]{.mark} radical [movements in the
region?]{.mark}]{.underline} Kelley First, [[white supremacy has been
fundamental in the structure of capitalist
exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark} in the South. It would not have worked
without it. Here [you had a budding [industrial]{.mark} center of
[Birmingham]{.mark}, Alabama, which [was]{.mark} a]{.underline} fairly
[new city. It was [not fifty years old]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
industrial core had been established for a generation, perhaps a
generation and a half. [In order [for industrial capitalists to be
profitable they needed]{.mark} to [lower wages and]{.mark} maintain [a
more docile]{.mark}]{.underline}\[End Page 220\] [[workforce]{.mark}.
They did not just use race to reduce wages, they also used company towns
that were highly policed to keep workers enclosed]{.underline} and
sequestered. [These systems of]{.underline} white supremacy and
[segregation made it almost impossible for white workers to see that
uniting with black workers was in their class interest.]{.underline}
Camp Were the patterns of segregation different [in]{.underline}
Birmingham than [other regions such as Detroit?]{.underline} Kelley Yes,
definitely. It was not modern segregation with slums, massive
unemployment, and warehousing people. [The [segregation was built around
industrial parks]{.mark}]{.underline} where you had steel, iron ore, and
then mining where black and white workers lived in close proximity. In
the city itself there were alleyways with black people living behind
white people or in very close vicinity because whites depended on black
female domestic labor. [Industrial workers were housed all together,
maybe separated by a street or a particular building. Yet segregation
wasn't about separation at all. [It was about being able to justify a
superior position for white workers that was only slightly superior to
black workers and also corralling all workers in a way that made them
constantly policed]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The Tennessee Coal, Iron and
Railroad Company was [a company town]{.mark}. It [had local
private]{.mark} police [agencies that patrolled with
shotguns]{.mark}]{.underline} to make sure that people couldn't escape.
[It was very [similar to the mining compounds in South
Africa]{.mark}]{.underline} where people on contract labor were locked
in barbed-wire fences and prevented from leaving until their contracts
were up. The whole system of economic exploitation was built on a very
explosive racial situation. [People wanted to organize because
conditions were so bad, but the system could not tolerate any
organization. [The antiunion position]{.mark} in the South [was so
severe that capitalists wouldn't even tolerate industrial
organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Any challenge to the system resulted
in violence, both official police violence and extralegal violence. [You
had police supporters in the form of the]{.underline} Ku Klux
[Klan]{.underline}, the White Legion, various white supremacist
organizations, and then vigilantes who did the dirty work of the police.
Camp [[There was continuity between police and mob
violence.]{.mark}]{.underline} Kelley Right. That was actually very
common. It kept the police fairly clean by allowing some of the most
violent acts, such as people being kidnapped, to occur at night. [The
police would arrest black workers and say, "We dropped the charges."
Then they would release them]{.underline} in the middle of the night
[into]{.underline}\[End Page 221\] [the hands of a waiting
mob]{.underline}. These are the conditions under which the Party
operated. Of course they imagined things were changing after 1935 with
the Popular Front when several developments converged. First, the Soviet
Union took the position that they needed to build as broad an alliance
as possible of intellectuals, activists, and labor against fascism. That
meant reducing the sectarianism of the Party. It also meant fighting
fascism not just abroad but at home. It coincided with things like the
La Follette Committee and the Senate's investigations of antiradical and
antilabor violence; the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and
its industrial organizing campaign that was changing the nature of labor
itself; the New Deal's new focus on protecting union rights; and
meanwhile more intellectuals became involved with the Party. The
difference is that in Alabama most liberals were prosegregationist and
extremely anticommunist. [In the South---and really throughout the rest
of the country---[prosegregationist and anticommunist sentiments were
two sides of the same coin. Evidence of procommunist sympathies included
being]{.mark} for integration and [against segregation]{.mark}. If you
were antiracist you are automatically a communist. J. Edgar Hoover said
that you could tell a Communist because they are the ones that have
Negroes coming into their house]{.underline}. Although that is kind of
funny because when you think about it, Negroes had Negroes coming into
their house that were not Communist. You had to be a white person for
this to mean anything. But the fact that the Party could not win a
significant white liberal following in Alabama meant that the Popular
Front in the South was kind of a disaster. The few liberals who came out
got badly beaten. Joseph Gelders, a Jewish radical I write about and
whose daughter Marge Gelders and her husband were all radicals, got
beaten so badly he almost died. No one expected that. He was a professor
and an intellectual. [[You had antiblack racism, but anti-Semitism also
justified beatings of liberals and radicals]{.mark} in the
South]{.underline}. Antiradical violence in Alabama actually did not
subside after the Popular Front.

#### Our Camp and Kelley ev proves Marxism is a useful framing for collective struggle---in fact, black labor movements have used these tropes to universalize the struggle, even in hostile conditions like early 1900s Alabama

Robin D. G. Kelley

The timing is really important. The project was conceived in the early
1980s. [[My interest was in]{.underline}]{.mark} southern Africa,
specifically [[the South African Left]{.underline}.]{.mark} At the same
time, the Jesse Jackson campaign and the Rainbow Coalition was taking
off, as was the idea of multiracial and multiethnic organizing actually
led by people of color. [I was involved in campaigns at UCLA and was
simultaneously trying to write about an original rainbow
coalition]{.underline}. My dissertation began as a comparative study of
radicalism in South Africa and the US South. I ended up dropping the
South Africa piece because I was denied access to the country. Yet with
a South African framing of what became a US story I was forced to think
hard about things like intraracial class tensions and conflicts. [[I had
to look at Alabama differently. I couldn't look at the black working
class as a]{.underline}]{.mark} kind of [[solid whole, nor could I look
at the white working class]{.mark} in [the same]{.mark}
way]{.underline}. Part of what Hammer and Hoe tried to do was look at
Alabama society as whole, not just black workers. \[End Page 215\]

Kelley

It's been interesting. [I am]{.underline} really [happy with that
book]{.underline}. Looking over it again, I am not sure what I would do
differently because I said what I needed to say. The reviews over all
have been great, but more importantly the way a number of activists and
organizers on the Left have talked about that book has been very
heartening. For many readers, [the book does three things. First, it
demonstrates that [substantial, effective organizing can occur under the
worst of circumstances]{.mark}; that immense poverty, depression, and
violence weren't]{.underline} successful [deterrents to movement
building.]{.underline}

[Second,]{.underline} that even the most ardent racists are not fixed in
their ideology. People can be transformed in the struggle. [[Racism is
definitely a fetter to multiracial organizing, but]{.underline}]{.mark}
Hammer and Hoe shows how [[people built a movement across the color line
in the most racist place of all. Anyone watching]{.mark} footage of
[Bull Connor in]{.mark} Ingram Park in [1963 could not believe that
thirty years before that there had been an interracial group]{.mark} of
five thousand people [in Birmingham]{.mark} standing on the street
[demanding]{.mark} relief, [jobs, and an end to police
brutality.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Third, that [class politics are alive]{.mark}]{.underline} and well.
[[But any class politics that pretend]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[race
and]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[gender get in the way of class
organizing miss the point]{.mark} altogether. [You can actually build
white support for antiracism]{.mark}]{.underline}, male support for
antisexism, [[and black support for white working-class justice]{.mark}.
People can and do cross the boundaries]{.underline} that historians and
scholars impose on people. [The levels of empathy that many]{.underline}
of the people in Hammer and Hoe [showed---the fact that people were
willing to be beaten or die for others---is an]{.underline} extremely
[important lesson]{.underline}. We spend so much time theorizing race,
class, and gender and wondering whether or not you can get people of a
particular identity to move, but we don't even ask the question "Can you
get Steve to risk his life for Hosea Hudson?" [[It is not that Steve is
supporting Hosea Hudson because he is black and male; Steve is
supporting Hosea Hudson because he is part of a movement that
says,]{.mark} solidarity is the only answer. [Collective struggle is the
only answer to solving all of our problems, and your problem is
mine]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Even though the Alabama Communist Party faded out, their a priori fatalism toward class struggle undercuts consideration of alternatives---this card smokes their alt answers

Kelley I think the most important lessons are not the ones I recognize
or acknowledged, but the lessons activist/readers take from the book
upon reflecting on their own experiences and dreams of the world they
are trying to build. That said, I do think that [[the book
proves---again---that antiracism and class solidarity are not
trade-offs]{.underline}]{.mark} or mutually exclusive [but mutually
constitutive. [The same holds true for all forms of oppression---sexism,
homophobia, et cetera]{.mark}.]{.underline} Second, Hammer and Hoe
should not be seen as a road map or a source of strategic knowledge to
be drawn on for current movements. Indeed, [[the biggest
criticism]{.mark} of the book [is that the Communist Party "lost" in
Alabama, and therefore]{.mark} it [isn't worth]{.mark} even [writing
about. I disagree: it matters because]{.mark} (1) [these struggles do
make a difference]{.mark} on a small level, [improving the lives of
working-class African Americans on many occasions (keeping them from
being evicted, helping them survive by getting more]{.mark} relief and
[electricity]{.mark} and coal, [defending]{.mark} local [people in
court, et cetera); (2) through a different]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}analysis or [[theoretical framework, it placed what appeared to
be local]{.underline}]{.mark} and isolated [[struggles]{.mark}
against]{.underline} "mean" bosses and [landlords [into a global
context]{.mark}, one [that exposed the structural dimensions of
cap]{.mark}italism]{.underline} as a system [[and offered a different
path; (3) the movement did]{.underline}]{.mark}, in some ways, [[lay the
groundwork for the next generation]{.mark} of activists]{.underline} who
truly transformed the face of the South and the United States as a
whole. [Finally, this work reveals something about how people think and
how struggle changes their ideas about what is possible, why they are
poor and oppressed, and what are the alternatives to Jim Crow
capitalism]{.underline}. I've come to realize that this task might have
been the most important of all.

#### Castigating us by referring to everything we do and say as "whiteness" is such a vague and amorphous neoliberal tool that reifies both racism and the K

**Reed 13** \[Adolph, professor of political science @ U Pennsylvania,
Marx, Race, and Neoliberalism, New Labor Forum January/February 2013 22:
49-57\]

[This]{.underline} sort of [historical materialist perspective throws
into relief a fundamental limitation of the ["whiteness]{.mark}" notion
that has been]{.underline} [fashionable]{.underline} within the academic
left for roughly two decades: **[it [reifies whiteness as a
transhistorical social category]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In effect, [[it
treats "whiteness"---]{.mark}and]{.underline} therefore
"[race]{.underline}"---[[as]{.mark} existing [prior to]{.mark} and above
[social context]{.mark}]{.underline}.10 [[Both who qualifies as white
and the significance of being white have altered over
time.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moreover, **[[whiteness discourse functions
as a]{.mark} kind of [moralistic exposé rather than a basis for
strategic politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**; this is clear in that [[the
program]{.underline}]{.mark} signally [articulated]{.underline} in its
name [[has been]{.underline}]{.mark} [[simply]{.mark} to raise [a demand
to "abolish whiteness]{.mark}," that is, to call on whites to renounce
their racial privilege]{.underline}. In fact, its [[fixation on]{.mark}
demonstrating the depth of]{.underline} whites' embrace of what was
known to an earlier generation's version of this argument as
"[[white]{.underline}]{.mark} skin [[privilege]{.underline}]{.mark}"
[and the]{.underline} inclination to slide into [teleological accounts
in which groups]{.underline} or individuals "approach" or
"[pursue]{.underline}" [whiteness]{.underline} **[[erases the]{.mark}
real [historical dynamics and contradictions of American racial
history]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The whiteness discourse overlaps other
[arguments that presume racism to be a sui generis]{.mark} form of
[injustice]{.mark}. Despite seeming provocative, these arguments [do not
go beyond the]{.mark} premises of the [racial liberalism from which
they]{.mark} commonly [purport to dissent]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
**[[They differ only in rhetorical flourish, not
content]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Formulations that invoke [metaphors
of]{.mark}]{.underline} disease or [[original sin **reify**]{.mark}
**[racism by disconnecting it from]{.mark} the [discrete historical
circumstances and social structures]{.mark} in which it is embedded, and
[treating it as]{.mark} an [autonomous]{.mark} force.**]{.underline}
[Disconnection from political economy is]{.underline} also [a crucial
feature of]{.underline} [postwar liberalism's construction of racial
inequality as prejudice or intolerance]{.underline}. [Racism becomes an
independent variable in a moralistic argument that is idealist
intellectually and ultimately defeatist politically.]{.underline} [[This
tendency to see racism as sui generis]{.mark} also [generates]{.mark} a
**[resistance to precision in analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It is
[fueled by a tendency to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[inflate]{.mark} the
language of [racism to the edge of its reasonable conceptual
limits]{.mark},]{.underline} if not beyond. [Ideological commitment to
shoehorning]{.underline} [into the rubric of racism all manner of
inequalities that may appear statistically as racial disparities has
yielded two related interpretive pathologies. One is a constantly
expanding panoply of neologisms---"institutional racism,"]{.underline}
["systemic racism," "structural racism," "color-blind racism,"
"post-racial racism," etc.---intended to graft more complex social
dynamics onto a simplistic and frequently psychologically inflected
racism/anti-racism **political ontology**]{.underline}. Indeed, these
efforts bring to mind \[Thomas S.\] Kuhn's account of attempts to
accommodate mounting anomalies to salvage an interpretive paradigm in
danger of crumbling under a crisis of authority.11 [A
second]{.underline} essentialist [sleight-of-hand advances claims for
the primacy of race/racism as an explanation of inequalities in the
present by invoking analogies to regimes of explicitly racial
subordination in the past.]{.underline} In these arguments, **[analogy
stands in for evidence]{.underline}** [and explanation of the
contemporary centrality of racism]{.underline}. Michelle Alexander's
widely read and cited book, [The New Jim Crow]{.underline}, is only the
most prominent expression of this tendency; even she has to acknowledge
that the [analogy fails because the historical circumstances are so
radically different]{.underline}.12 Rigorous pursuit of equality of
opportunity exclusively within the terms of capitalist class relations
has been fully legitimized under the rubric of "diversity."

### at: vote for minorities

#### Voting for them to promote black success is a neoliberal uplift narrative that insidiously reproduces racist ideologies 

**Reed 18** \[Adolph Reed is a professor of political science at the
University of Pennsylvania, "The Trouble With Uplift," September 1,
2018, https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-trouble-with-uplift-reed\]

[[This vision of]{.mark} unyielding [black pathology
is]{.mark}]{.underline} yet [a]{.underline}nother [[testament to]{.mark}
**[the harmony of antiracist and neolib]{.mark}**]{.underline}eral
[[ideologies]{.underline}]{.mark}---and it, too, harks directly back to
the origins of the black leadership caste at the dawn of the last
century. Washington and Du Bois, together with Garvey and other
prominent racial nationalists, envisioned their core constituency as a
politically mute black population in need of tutelage from their
ruling-class-backed leaders. Touré F. Reed persuasively argues that the
mildly updated version of this vision now serves as an essential
cornerstone of the new [black]{.underline} professional-managerial class
politics. Underclass mythology grounds [[professional-class claims to
race leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}, while
[[providing]{.underline}]{.mark} the normative foundation of [[uplift
programs directed toward enhancing self-esteem]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[rather than the material redistribution of wealth and
income]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Exhortations to
celebrate]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[demand
accolades]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[career
opportunities]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and material
accumulation]{.underline}]{.mark} for black celebrities and rich
people---e.g., box office receipts for black filmmakers or contracts and
prestigious appointments for other well-positioned black people---as a
racial politics are consistent with the sporadic eruptions of "Buy
Black" campaigns since the 1920s and 1930s. Such efforts stood out in
stark contrast to more working-class based "Don't Buy Where You Can't
Work" campaigns that demanded employment opportunities in establishments
serving black neighborhoods. Like "Buy Black" campaigns, which seem to
[[have risen]{.underline}]{.mark} again [[from]{.underline}]{.mark} the
tomb of petit-bourgeois **[[wishful thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[projections of successes for the rich and famous as generic racial
victories]{.underline}]{.mark}** depend on **[[a sleight-of-hand that
treats benefits for any black person as benefits for all black
people]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This brings to mind comedian Chris Rock's
quip that he went to his mailbox every day for two weeks after the not
guilty verdict in the O.J. Simpson murder trial looking for his "O. J.
prize," only to be disappointed. Pain and Proprietorship At times,
[[this tendency to absorb the plural into the singular can
be]{.underline}]{.mark} strikingly crude and [[transparently
self-interested.]{.underline}]{.mark} The torrent of hostility directed
at Rachel Dolezal for having represented herself as black rested on
groundless---sometimes entirely made up---claims that she had
appropriated jobs, awards, and other honorifics intended for blacks. In
addition to the annual contretemps over whether blacks win enough of the
most prestigious Oscars, recent racial controversies in the art world
illustrate how easily the narrowest guild concerns can masquerade as
burning matters of racial justice. The Brooklyn Museum's hiring of a
white person as consulting curator of African art sparked objections
that the hire perpetuated "pervasive structures of white supremacy in
the art field." The 2017 furor over the Whitney Biennial's display of
Dana Schutz's "Open Casket"---inspired by the infamous 1955 photograph
of Emmett Till's brutalized body---reduced to a question of ownership of
"black suffering," or more accurately, of the right to represent and
materially benefit from the representation of black suffering. The
protesters' objection, as Walter Benn Michaels put it succinctly, was
that "black pain belongs to black artists." It's worth noting that one
of the leading critics of the painting and its display was Hannah Black,
who contended that "non-black people must accept that they will never
embody and cannot understand" the gesture Till's mother, Mamie, made in
insisting on an open-casket funeral. Black, who not only called for the
painting to be removed from display, but also offered an "urgent
recommendation" that it be destroyed, is a Briton who lives in Berlin.
From a different standard of cultural proprietorship, one might argue
that Schutz, as an American, has a stronger claim than Black to
interpret the Till story. After all, the segregationist Southern order
and the struggle against that order, which gave Till's fate its broader
social and political significance, were historically specific moments of
a distinctively American experience. In fact, most claims of cultural
ownership and charges of appropriation are bogus. While sometimes they
provide an instrumental basis for tortious claims, as in pursuit of
restitution for Nazi and other imperialists' looting of artifacts, more
often they posit a dead-end conflation of fixed and impermeable racial
identity with cultural expression. As Michaels has argued for more than
twenty-five years, the discourse of cultural ownership stems from the
pluralist mindset that treats "culture" as a key marker of social groups
and thereby inscribes it as racial essentialism. In order to legitimate
what Michaels describes as "racial rent-seeking," [[a curiously
inflexible brand of race-first neolib]{.underline}]{.mark}eralism [[has
taken]{.underline}]{.mark} [[root in American political
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[proposing a trickle-down model of
racial progress]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[anchored in the mysticism of
organic black community]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Against this exoticized
backdrop, neoliberal race leaders stage the beguiling fantasy that
individual "entrepreneurialism" is the key path to rising above one's
circumstances---i.e., the standard American social myth that obscures
the deeper need to combat systemic inequalities. The most tragic, and
pathetic, expressions of this faith are the versions of the "gospel of
prosperity," which fuse pop self-realization psychology and a barely
recognizable Christianity to exploit desperation and the desire for life
with dignity and respect among their black-majority congregations. The
false hopes of the prosperity gospel encourage already vulnerable people
to fall prey to all sorts of destructive get-rich-quick schemes; they
are the "sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world,
and the soul of soulless conditions" channeled through a
market-idolatrous Protestant psychobabble. Black ministers and other
proponents of entrepreneurialist ideology as racial uplift also played a
largely unrecognized role in pushing subprime mortgages, and even payday
loans, in black communities. The racial trickle-down success myth is
partly a vestige of an earlier era, during which individual black
attainments could be seen as testaments to the race's capacities---and a
refutation of the white-sanctioned view of black people as generally
inferior. Even then, however, this model of black uplift was enmeshed in
the race theory of the time---notably the belief that a race's
capacities were indicated by the accomplishments of its "best"
individuals---and it was always inflected with the class perspectives of
those who saw themselves as such individuals. [[The class legacies of
this]{.underline}]{.mark} foundational moment [[in modern black politics
may]{.underline}]{.mark} well [[contribute to the]{.underline}]{.mark}
firm [[insistence among today's "black voices" that slavery and Jim Crow
mark the transcendent truth of black]{.underline}]{.mark} Americans'
[[experience]{.underline}]{.mark} in the United States---and **[[that an
irreducible racism is the source of all manifest racial
inequality]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[That diagnosis certainly masks
class asymmetries]{.underline}]{.mark}** among black Americans'
circumstances **[[as well as in the remedies proposed to improve
them.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Nevertheless, **[[we continue to indulge
the]{.mark}]{.underline}** politically wrong-headed,
**[[counterproductive]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** even **[[reactionary
features]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the "representative black voice"
industry [[in whatever remains of our contemporary public
sphere]{.underline}]{.mark}. And we never reckon with the truly
disturbing presumption that any black person who can gain access to the
public microphone and performs familiar rituals of "blackness" should be
recognized as expressing significant racial truths and deserves our
attention. [[This presumption rests on the unexamined premise that
blacks share a common, singular mind that is at once radically
unknowable to non-blacks and readily downloaded by any random
individual]{.underline}]{.mark} setting up shop as a racial voice. And
[[despite]{.underline}]{.mark} what all of our age's many **[[heroic
narratives of individualist race-first triumph]{.underline}]{.mark}**
may suggest to the casual viewer, **[[that premise is the essence of
racism]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### That reinforces the symbiotic relation between antiracist politics and Democratic neoliberalism

**Reed 18** \[Adolph Reed Jr., professor of political science at the
University of Pennsylvania, "Black Politics After 2016," Feb 11, 2018,
*nonsite* issue #23,
<https://nonsite.org/article/black-politics-after-2016>\]

Like any ideology that gains traction, [race reductionism also has a
material foundation]{.underline}. [Black ethnic politics consolidated
around exponential growth of a stratum of office holders and public
functionaries, and it has encouraged and reinforced development of what
might be called a **political economy of race-relations or diversity
management**]{.underline}. [That includes a burgeoning, multibillion
dollar diversity industry that extends to corporations and universities,
where pursuit and monitoring of diversity is woven into human resource
functions]{.underline} and overseen by in-house diversity professionals
and administrators and freelance consultants. [Insofar as diversity is
valued in personnel policies, the significance of this political
economy, and the ideology that emanates from and underwrites it, ranges
far beyond those who work in the diversity/race relations economy
directly.]{.underline} Diversity as a norm of fairness pervades the
professional-managerial strata and ratifies an ideal of social justice
that harmonizes seamlessly with market-driven neoliberalism because it
combines celebration of difference and aggressive pursuit of equality of
opportunity, to the exclusion of economic redistribution. This is the
essential truth reflected in the subtitle of Walter Benn Michaels's
book, The Trouble with Diversity, namely that we---at least in the
professional-managerial strata---have come to "love identity and ignore
inequality." [The political economy of race relations management has
grown symbiotically with neoliberalism]{.underline}. [The symbiosis may
be clearest in the privatization, outsourcing, and overall retraction of
social services, as **claims to authentic representation of "community"
voices** and perspectives]{.underline} factor into criteria for awarding
contracts and standing in policy processes that are increasingly
insulated from democratic oversight and accountability. [The norm of
representation as embodiment of appropriate categories of identity gives
private and nonprofit contractors an easy standard of legitimacy that
collapses possible differences on policy issues and directions into
vacant liberal proceduralism]{.underline} (having a "seat at the table")
and Victorian racialist mysticism ("reflecting the perspective of the
X"). The symbiotic relationship shows up also in the ways that a
politics grounded on identity can obfuscate dynamics of economic
inequality and dispossession by rendering them in cultural terms. Debate
over displacement for upscaling redevelopment is a case in point. In
opting for a language of "gentrification," opponents of displacement,
often without intending to do so, cloud a simple, straightforward
dynamic---public support of private developers' pursuit of
rent-intensifying redevelopment---with cultural implications that shift
critique away from the issue of using public authority to engineer
upward redistribution and impose hardship on relatively vulnerable
residents. Instead, discussion of gentrification slides into objections
about display of privilege, and lack of recognition or respect that,
notwithstanding the moral outrage that accompanies them, accept the
logic of rent-intensifying redevelopment as given and demand that
newcomers acknowledge and honor aboriginal habitus and practices and
that the "community" be involved in the processes of upgrading. A
similar racial or cultural discourse has unhelpfully shaped opposition
to charterization of public education by focusing on the racial
dimension of the process. The fundamental problem with Teach For America
and such privatizers, after all, is not that the missionaries are mainly
white and unfamiliar with native culture or even that many of them are
tourists building extracurriculars for their graduate and professional
school dossiers. Those are only idiosyncratically distasteful features
of a particular line of attack on one front in a broader war on public
goods and the idea of social solidarity in line with marketization of
all human needs. And that sort of culturalist discourse also opens
opportunities for petty, and not so petty, entrepreneurship in the name
of respect or recognition of the community, within the logic of
neoliberalization. Race reductionism enables a sleight-of-hand in which
benefits to individuals can appear to be victories for the generic
racial population or community. The more deeply embedded a groupist
notion of fairness or justice becomes as common sense, the more easily
that sleight-of-hand works under labels like "community empowerment,"
"voice," "opportunity," or "representation" to propel and legitimize
accumulation by dispossession. [The symbiotic relation between
antiracist politics and Democratic neoliberalism helps to make sense of
the vitriol with which so many antiracist activists have reacted to
Sanders and the renewed interest in challenging economic
inequality]{.underline}. Notwithstanding copious evocations of the
heroic period of black insurgent activism, [this politics is not
directed toward generating the deep and broad solidarities necessary for
building an insurgent political movement]{.underline}. [It is an
insider, elite-driven interest group politics that is concerned less
with reducing inequality than with establishing and
maintaining]{.underline} what Kenneth Warren describes as "[managerial
authority]{.underline} over the nation's Negro problem." As West
observed regarding the race relations framework's emergence at the dawn
of the twentieth century, **[claims to speak for black concerns in this
politics do not depend on demonstration of accountability to any
specific constituencies of black people]{.underline}**. From Coates and
other pundits to the many random Black Lives Matter activists those who
expatiate about black Americans' lack of interest in social-democratic
politics claim [interpretive authority based on the mysticism of organic
racial representation and]{.underline}, most immediately, [recognition
by corporate media and elites as authentic voices.]{.underline}

[Russell]{.underline} (1998, 2001) [takes a different approach to the
political economy of disability, situating her analysis within the
tradition of critical [Marxism]{.mark}. She [traces]{.mark} the effects
of the interactions between the [economic structures and the political
system]{.mark} as they influence the lives [of disabled people
through]{.mark} state-supported [eugenics]{.mark}, the systematic
[exclusion]{.mark} of people with disabilities [from]{.mark} the
[labor]{.mark} force, and both the both corporate and charity-based
[privatization]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the public responsibilities of
providing [services]{.mark} and equipment for people with
disabilities.]{.underline} In her book, Beyond Ramps: Disability at the
End of the Social Contract, [Russell]{.underline} (1998) [begins her
political economic analysis with a critique of [the medical
model]{.mark} of disability, that [which seeks to cure]{.mark} the
impairments of people with [disabilities]{.mark}, thereby situating
disability as an individual crisis or personal tragedy to be overcome or
fixed. She argues that it [as a result of]{.mark} this model that
[political and financial efforts focus on correcting]{.mark} the [bodies
and minds]{.mark} of individuals rather than on removing barriers to
social participation for people with disabilities. Additionally, she
indicates that [the individualization of disability]{.mark} [that
accompanies the medical model has]{.mark} historically [been employed to
differentiate]{.mark} [people]{.mark} with disabilities [from the
general population]{.mark}, to cast them as abnormal, as less than
human]{.underline}. Next, [Russell]{.underline} (1998) [traces the
shameful histories of eugenics in the United States, England and Germany
from the turn of the 20th century through World War II. She highlights
the economic rationalization of forced sterilization programs in the
United States and England and the mass extermination of first children,
and then adults, with disabilities in Hitler's Germany. In particular,
she describes how [people with disabilities were characterized]{.mark}
by the Nazi government [as drains on]{.mark} the [social welfare]{.mark}
system ([due to their inability to produce]{.mark} in a capitalist
economic system while at the same time requiring the state to spend
money on their behalf). This economic justification combined with the
Social Darwinism of the time, contributed to the creation of a
state-supported program of eugenics of people with disabilities that was
not only sanctioned by but also enforced by the medical establishment of
the time]{.underline}. From the political economy of Nazi era eugenics,
Russell (1998) moves to the current debate over euthanasia and "the
right to die" for people with disabilities. Citing a study from the New
England Journal of Medicine that surveyed physicians in Oregon (the
first state to legalize euthanasia), she demonstrates the connections
between financial considerations and policies Grossman, 2004 around
physician-assisted suicide by recounting that in addition to the 60% of
physicians who reported supporting assisted suicide, 80% indicated that
economics might influence patient decisions. Moreover, she offers the
example of Larry McAfee, a quadriplegic in Georgia who, facing forced
institutionalization as a consequence of insufficient state-supported
programs that allow for independent living, petitioned the courts for
and was granted the right to suicide, as a further example of the
political bias toward the extermination of people with disabilities over
the provision of services. As a result, Russell (1998) is left asking
the haunting questions: "But are patients who face destitution really
choosing death? Or are they victims of Social Darwinist euthanasia
policy under which the rich can buy all the care they need while the
poor must do without?" (40). [Continuing her exploration of the
political economy of disability, Russell (1998) provides a history of
the opposition to the passage of Social Security in the United States,
detailing the roles played by the private insurance industry and the
American Medical Association. In addition, she highlights the
difficulties that eligibility requirement for [programs]{.mark} like
Medicaid and Social Security which [require restricted incomes]{.mark}
and/or limited assets present [for people with disabilities]{.mark} who
want to work. Moreover, she is extremely critical of the emphasis on
private sector charities over a public safety net.]{.underline} In
particular, she blasts Jerry Lewis and his Muscular Dystrophy
Association (MDA) for their [portrayal of people with disabilities as
pitiable and in need of cures, as well as the profit-making tactics that
govern the distribution of funds raised by the
organization]{.underline}. She provides evidence that two-thirds of the
money raised by MDA in 1991 was spent on overhead, with only the
remaining one-third of funds to be split between direct patient services
and research grants.Grossman, 2004 Furthermore, [Russell (1998)
discusses the effect of the ideology of capitalism in attracting the
interest of then President George H.W. Bush to support [the Americans
with Disabilities Act]{.mark} (what [has]{.mark} since [been]{.mark}
touted as the most sweeping piece of legislation for people with
disabilities in the history of the United States) as a [low-cost way to
reduce]{.mark} the number of people on government [assistance under the
disguise of civil rights]{.mark} for people with disabilities. In
addition, [she identifies economics as the primary motivation for the
political actions]{.mark} that initiated continuing disability reviews
(CDRs) and the multiple changes to federal definitions of disability,
both of which were intended to reduce access to state systems of
support.]{.underline} In a later article, [Russell (2001) continues to
elaborate on the relationships between political and economic spheres as
evidenced by her redefinition of disabled people as "persons deemed less
exploitable or not exploitable by the owning class who control the means
of production in a capitalist economy" (87). She identifies the role of
(the [capitalist) class interests in determining the level of
participation in social life afforded to people with disabilities
through economically rationalized decisions about]{.mark} both the
[exclusion and inclusion]{.mark} of people with disabilities in the
labor force at different times in America's history]{.underline} (i.e.,
sheltered workshops; unwillingness of employers to offer accommodations,
despite the ADA). Again, [she highlights the interplay between
capitalist interests and the medicalization of disability that result in
a focus on curing the individual, avoiding the institution of policies
that remove barriers to social and economic participation]{.underline}.
In "Mainfesto of an Uppity Crip", the penultimate chapter of Beyond
Ramps, [[Russell]{.mark} (1998) [outlines a plan for change]{.mark},
offering more than twenty-five suggestion [for anti-capitalist]{.mark}
[reform]{.mark} that include actions like ensuring greater corporate
accountability, instituting campaign finance reform, returning the media
to the public, adopting the principles of universal design to public and
private spaces, mandating a living wage, and replacing the current mode
of "institutional profiteering]{.underline}" (222) through the provision
of Personal Assistance Services that support people with disabilities
living in the community. She [concludes the book by [arguing]{.mark}

University, "Hardt and Negri and the Geo-Political Imagination: Empire,
Multitude and Critical Disability Studies," Critical Sociology 39.3\]

[Critical disability studies must respond to the inequities of
globalization]{.underline} and place an analysis of disability at the
epicentre of a geo-political imagination. Specifically [[Global North
critical disability studies have failed to engage with the Global
South]{.underline}]{.mark} (Grech, 2009, 2011; Meekosha, 2008, 2010,
2011). [[There are 400 million disabled people in the Global
South]{.underline}]{.mark} (66--75% of the world's disabled people). As
Grech notes (2011), guesstimates have emerged, claiming that
[[82%]{.mark} of disabled people [live in]{.mark} the Global South in
[conditions of poverty and]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[one-fifth of the
world's poorest people are disabled]{.mark} people]{.underline}. The
assumption of a disability and poverty relationship has created the
strongest linkages between disability and the broader development
agenda. Whilst [[disabled people]{.underline}]{.mark} do indeed make up
the majority world, they [[remain excluded from global
citizenship.]{.underline}]{.mark} As Goodley (2011: 39) notes:

Citing a number of resources (including
http://wecando.wordpress.com/about/ and http://www.apids.org),
[[Meekosha]{.underline}]{.mark} (2008) [[questions the implicit values
of Northern hemisphere disability studies including]{.underline}]{.mark}
(i) [[claims to universality]{.underline}]{.mark} (what happens in the
'Global North' should happen in the South); (ii) [[a reading from the
Metropole]{.underline}]{.mark} (a methodological projection of ideas
from the centre into the periphery); (iii) [[emphasis on the importance
of Northern]{.mark} feudal/[capitalist modes of production (with an
accompanying ignorance and grand erasure of
indigenous]{.mark}/traditional [modes of living]{.mark} of the
South]{.underline}); (iv) [[a colonialism of psychic, cultural and
geographical life]{.mark} of the South [by the North
and]{.mark}]{.underline} (v) [[ignorance of the
resistant-subaltern-positions of 'Global
Southerners']{.underline}.]{.mark}

Grech (2011: 3) makes the powerful case that:

[[Disability studies ... has not served the subject of majority world
disability, dominated by white, Western, middle class academics, its
debate imbued with ideological, theoretical, cultural and historical
assumptions]{.mark} -- those pertaining to, and grounded in Western
urban post-industrialised societies]{.underline}, notably West European
and North American (WENA). Despite Western foundations, [[disability
studies has reached hegemonic status in the disability and majority
world debate as the exportation of its ideas]{.mark} (notably the social
model of disability) [from North to South continues unabated. This seems
to be legitimised by]{.mark}]{.underline} numerous factors: the
marginalisation/exclusion of disability in the development sector; [[the
monopolisation of most things disability by]{.mark} the [Western]{.mark}
disability [studies; and the assumption that disability theories]{.mark}
and writings [from the West are transferable across the globe]{.mark}
with few or no modifications]{.underline} ... Overall, as Stone (1999)
contends, [[this]{.mark} transfer/[imposition]{.mark} of epistemologies
[is more]{.mark} akin to [imperialism than]{.mark} to
[empowerment]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

**RedEd 11** \[May 22 2011, Communism: The real movement to abolish

<https://libcom.org/library/communism-real-movement-abolish-disability>\]

[[The following]{.underline}]{.mark} article [[is a tentative attempt to
combine communist theory with the insights of disability
activists]{.mark} and theorists in order [to promote revolutionary
approaches to]{.mark} understanding and [overcoming the oppression of
disabled people]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Communism: The real
movement to abolish disability [The dominant ideas of the ruling class
are the dominant ideas of the age]{.underline}. As revolutionaries we
know this and must constantly be alert to the ways in which they
influence and limit our own conception of how things are and where they
might go. [We are alert to the fact that [in our popular culture it is
easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In the revolutionary milieu we
reject -with varying degrees of success- the universality of wage
labour, the state, the nuclear family and so on. In the piece I want to
focus on an area most revolutionaries never bring into their analysis of
political economy: disability. [[Disability]{.underline}]{.mark}, I will
argue, [[is a feature of present day social relations]{.mark}, that it
is [specific to capitalism]{.mark}, that it [will not go away as long as
capitalism persists and finally that communism presents the answer to
the problem]{.mark} of disability.]{.underline} In doing so [I locate
disability firmly in 'the present state of things' that Marx argued
communists must seek to abolish]{.underline}. What is disability?
[Disability as it is commonly tacitly understood as the category we use
to group together people whose bodies or minds are in some way
defective]{.underline}. We have a certain conception of how bodies and
minds ought to be, and people who deviate too much from that template we
call disabled. Disability is usually thought of in terms of what people
are not able to do: seeing, concentrating, walking, communicating and so
on. Disabled people cannot do some important thing. Their ability to
function is impaired. [This conception of [disability makes two
important assumptions. First]{.mark}, it assumes [that there is some
'natural' set of characteristics]{.mark}]{.underline} that non-defective
people have, deviation from which we can call disability[.
[Second]{.mark}, it assumes [that society is]{.mark}, in some universal
sense, [a place where for a person to be living optimally]{.mark} they
[must]{.mark} be able to [do all the things that the non-disabled
reification Template Man]{.mark}]{.underline} ([and he is a
man]{.underline}) [[can do]{.mark} and that people who can't present
some sort of problem]{.underline} needing to be, by turns, managed,
cared for and ignored. But where do these assumptions come from?
Template Man is an elusive figure. He is usually only visible by
inspecting his opposite. By seeing that a deaf person can't hear and
that a person with fatigue needs to sleep 11 hours a night, we know that
Template Man can hear and sleeps eight hours a night. But quite why
Template Man must be able to hear, we can't say. These two features of
Template Man are fairly universal throughout the capitalist world. But
others are much more variable. For example in some parts of the world
Template Man finds that meeting new people and moving jobs and houses
comes easily to him. We know this because by examining pathologies such
as social anxiety disorder, which are in part characterised by not being
able to do these things, we know that Template Man can do these things.
But in other parts of the world no such pathologies are apparent and
Template Man neither has nor does not have these characteristics. So
where is the key to this strange metaphysical entity defined only
through deviations from him? [[Template Man is, of course, the ideal
worker]{.mark} as defined by the needs of capital at any given moment
and in any given place. Template man is negatively defined precisely
because capital has no interest in nature of individual workers, or
workers as individuals]{.underline}. Workers must be able to do certain
things for certain periods of time. Everything else about them is
irrelevant to the needs of capital. [[Workers must be able to sell their
labour]{.underline}]{.mark} according to the needs of a large enough
segment of the employing class that they can fulfil their role as
commodities on the labour market. Workers must also be able to
'reproduce' (feed, rest, clean, relax, etc.) themselves for the cost of
the wages they can command and in the time they are not having to sell
their ability to work. [Workers also need to take part in the purchasing
of commodities capitalism uses to reproduce itself, from housing to
entertainment to insurance. Bodies and minds which are not well adjusted
to the tasks involved in carrying out these functions are
disabled.]{.underline} They are at odds with the demands of capital in
that place and time. To illustrate using the final example from the
paragraph above, [social anxiety stands in the way of the sale of labour
power in Britain today since capital demands we be able to move around
quickly and easily in order to do so]{.underline} and the content of
much work in many industries involved interacting in a 'friendly' manner
with strangers. There are plenty of communities in the world where
almost none of the wage labour involves these things, and in these
communities there is also no need for the idea of social anxiety
disorder, and this is reflected in medical practice. You can\'t get a
social anxiety disorder diagnosis in most of China, for instance
(thought this may not last). [To give another example, [the explosion in
Britain of diagnoses of specific learning disorders]{.mark}, such as
dyslexia, [has gone hand in hand with rising demand for more
literate]{.mark}, numerate [workers]{.mark}]{.underline} and the
increased difficulty workers have reproducing themselves outside of work
without these skills. We should also notice another implication of the
fact that Template Man is negatively defined. Being able to do things
well, or do things most people can't, has nothing to do with disability.
Disability is about what a person cannot do, not about what they can.
The implications of this are quite important, as we will see later when
we examine the first half of the dictum 'from each according to their
ability, to each according to their needs'. The failure of reformism
[[In the reformist notion of disability the problem of disability is a
problem of inclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}. The basic category 'disabled'
is taken as given (or natural), and the task of the reformer is to win
changes in the institutions, buildings, etc. that disabled people want
to use so that they can start to approach the level of access to things
that non-disabled people have. In the technical jargon of the movement
'reasonable adjustments' should be made so that a person's impairment (a
characteristic such as chronic illness, autism, down's syndrome or
whatever) does not stop them accessing things as easily as people who do
not have impairments. The extent to which they cannot access these
things on an equitable basis is the extent to which they are disabled
according to this view. As usual, [[the revolutionary examining the
reformists' approach has a great deal of sympathy]{.mark} for their
goals, [but]{.mark} also [sees the forces that contradict the aims of
the reformists, and which will]{.mark}, at a certain point, [overpower
them.]{.mark} Our aim is to remove such forces, not fight an
interminable battle against them]{.underline}. If, as we have seen,
disabled people are people who, as a group, cannot be easily integrated
into the logic of capital then there is only so far they can go towards
equality before capital starts to push them back. Of course, [[the
reformist approach will win victories]{.underline}.]{.mark} Indeed,
[[they will often appeal to the smooth functioning of capital]{.mark} in
order [to do so]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} For example, in the UK a
program called 'access to work' has helped disabled people get jobs by
funding equipment, building alterations and so on which mean that the
labour power of particular disabled people is raised in value so it can
compete in the labour market with that of non-disabled people. To give a
simple illustration of how this works, there is no point in a company
hiring a wheel chair user if their building cannot be accessed by them,
and there's no point splashing out on ramps if a similar worker can be
hired instead, but if the state pays for the ramps, then the wheelchair
user represents good value to the employer in the labour market. The
state wins in this deal too, since through access to work it shifts
people off of benefits and into work, and the scheme payed for itself
through the tax revenue of the disabled people it got into employment
alone. However, [[when there is a glut of unemployed labour and]{.mark}
when [the state is cutting benefits]{.mark} for disabled people [anyway,
the logic of the scheme breaks down since non-disabled people are there
to do the jobs without the state expending money, and disabled people
are 'costing' the state less anyway.]{.mark} Given that those are the
conditions we are now living in, access to work is being
scrapped]{.underline}. We should not, of course, deny the important role
of disabled people in winning concessions from the state. The dynamic is
not simply one of the state managing disabled people so as to maximise
profits for bosses. Disabled people, like the working class in general,
struggle and win concessions and in doing so alter the operation of
capitalism. But when these concessions start to get in the way of the
functioning of capital, it becomes extremely difficult to defend them.
In times like this, when the conditions of the entire working class are
under attack, it should come as no surprise that those sectors of the
working class who are least well integrated in capital should be hit the
hardest and this includes disabled people. Finally, it is worth noting
that as [disabled people win more and more concessions from the state
due to their desire to participate in capitalist society on an equal
footing, the more dependent they will become on the state, and when, as
inevitably will happen, the state rolls back their victories, it will
hit them much harder.]{.underline} These contradictions within the
disability rights movement must lead us on to look for more radical
solutions to the problem. The abolition of disability The abolition of
disability has been a goal of many social movements and popular
fantasies under capitalism. Examples of this abound. Eugenics had its
heyday in Nazi Germany, but significantly predates Nazism and is a
tendency that is still with us in attempts to make sure no children with
down's syndrome are born by scanning and aborting foetuses, to
'managing' the sexual behaviour of people with profound learning
difficulties or mental health conditions, to flat out murder dressed up
as 'mercy killing'. Less despicable, but structurally similar, are the
techno-fantasies that imagine that with the right medical science, no
one need be disabled in the future. What these approaches have in common
is that they do not wish to do away with disability; they wish to do
away with disabled people. [[Since disability is]{.mark} not simply a
collection of individuals, but [a feature of capitalist social
relations]{.mark}, their approaches are doomed to failure regardless of
how morally acceptable we do or don't find them. If disability is a
feature particular to capitalism, and [if communism abolishes
capitalism, it follows then that communism abolishes
disability.]{.mark}]{.underline} But how does it do this? [[It's always
dangerous to sketch out]{.underline}]{.mark}, even in the broadest
terms, [[possible future societies.]{.underline}]{.mark} However, we may
risk a few comments explaining why disability cannot exist under
communism. Taking communist society characterised to be characterised by
self management of production and life in general, and where the slogan
'from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs'
is applied, it is possible to see how disability can be done away with.
[[It is easy to see how the phrase 'to each according to their needs'
will abolish an aspect of disability.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[If we
produce for need]{.underline}]{.mark} rather than profit [[there is no
reason why we should not chose to produce buildings, equipment,
technologies and so on that are designed on the assumption that physical
and psychological variation of all sorts is a normal part of human
society]{.underline}]{.mark} and that it is right to take this fully
into account when producing thing for people to use. The phrase 'from
each according to their ability' less obviously deals with disability,
but is in fact more fundamental to understanding why communism abolishes
it. As we have seen, disability is defined by people's inability to do
certain things that they are supposed, as good worker, to be able to do.
Under capitalism workers are interchangeable. We are only allowed to
produce (or, for that matter, consume) in ways designed to maximise
profit. In a society where production is self managed and for use, it
would be inconceivable to prevent people from contributing to society on
the grounds of what they were unable to do, when there was a great
number of things that they could do. In societies with less abundance
than western capitalism, there simply has not been the surplus to allow
people to go without contributing, albeit often in horrifically
exploitative ways. Capitalism has created both the necessary surplus and
the logic of production to stop disabled people in particular, and the
working class in general, from contributing fully or often at all.
[[Communism]{.underline}]{.mark}, through the self management of
production according to the principle that people contribute in the ways
they are most able to, [[overcomes capitalism's exclusionary practice
and overcomes the logic of alienation upon which capitalist production
is built.]{.mark}]{.underline} The full and equal integration of all
people into the reproduction of society, regardless of factors such as
impairment, is surely the goal of communism and the foundation of a
society in which the free development of each is the condition for the
free development of all.

no]{.mark} known **[possibility]{.mark} for any

**[[Baudrillard hesitated to put forward a political
program]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Also, in his later works, Baudrillard
accords with Marx in capitalist society was governed by production
during a certain period of time, there were class clashes, and that this
forced society to develop. According to Baudrillard, however, society
reached "the end of production" and thus the end of the Marxist research
program and the Marxist worldview. Yet even if Marx is explicitly
rejected in MoP, Baudrillard continues to work with problems that are
common to Marxism. [The effect of [Baudrillard\'s abandonment of
Marx]{.mark}ism is that **his investigation** of a theory of value never
gets down to particulars but [remains a **programmatic
sketch**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The value]{.underline} theory is
[located in a position that largely rejects historical materialism but
that uses dialectics and Marxian economic concepts]{.underline}. This
position can be debated, but it makes Baudrillard\'s edifice look fresh
and contemporary---and possible to use for dialogue with thinkers from
similar standpoints (see Karatani 2008; Engeström 2005).7

#### Voting aff makes class revolt impossible

**Smith 90** \[Tony, Professor of Philosophy at Iowa State, "The
Critique of Marxism in Baudrillard\'s Later Writings," *Rethinking
Marxism*, Spring 1990\]

From all that has been said thus far it follows that [the project of
revolutionary action]{.underline} [oriented by the rational
understanding of a dialectical social reality must be completely
abandoned]{.underline}. **[[Any attempt to escape
from]{.underline}]{.mark}** the simulations of
**[[hyperreality]{.underline}]{.mark}** only [further [entraps us in
it.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Where does this leave us? [Baudrillard seems
to propose]{.mark} two answers. One]{.underline} suggestion [is [that a
radical]{.mark} project today]{.underline} **[[does not attempt to
struggle against]{.underline}]{.mark}** the ceaseless production of
**[[hyperreality]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Instead, [the radical today is
[like a judo master who]{.mark}]{.underline} accepts the force thrown
against her, and who even [[reinforces that force]{.underline}]{.mark},
thereby [[throwing it off]{.underline}]{.mark}. Baudrillard's advice to
us is to amplify the hyperreality around us, to give in to its
fascination, rather than to attempt to resist it. He terms this
hyperconformism: "The strategic resistance is that of\...the
hyperconformist simulation of the very mechanisms of the system, which
is a form of refusal and of non-reception"1 (1983a, 108). This
amplification may then lead to the "implosion" of the hyperreality, to a
catastrophe whose dimensions cannot be predicted or imagined at this
point. [A second option seems to involve a more [active]{.mark} form of
[resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}. It involves a "challenge" to the
production of hyperreality: "Challenge is the opposite of dialogue: it
creates a nondialectic, ineluctable space. It is neither a means nor an
end: [it opposes its own space to political space]{.underline}. [It
knows neither middle-range nor long-term; its [only]{.mark} terms [is
the immediacy of a response]{.mark} [or]{.mark} of
[death]{.mark}]{.underline}. Everything linear, including history, has
an end; challenge alone is without end since it is indefinitely
reversible" (1987, 56). "[Challenge]{.underline}" in this sense [counts
as the purest form of defiance, for "defiance always comes from that
which has no meaning]{.underline}, no name, no identity---it is a
defiance of meaning, of power, of truth" (1983a, 70). [For Baudrillard
[the greatest moments of]{.mark} working-class [rebellion were
**not**]{.mark} **the [goal-directed attempts]{.mark}** [to seize state
power, but]{.mark} those **revolts that fit this notion of
challenge**]{.underline}. Here, too, [what was sought was an
"[implosion]{.mark}," not a revolution: "]{.underline}The real history
of class struggle\...(its) only moments were those when the dominated
class fought on the basis of its self-denial 'as such,' on the basis of
the sole fact that it amounted to nothing.. .When the class itself, or a
faction of it, prefers to act as a radical non-class, i.e. to act out
its own death right away within the explosive structure of capital, when
it chooses to implode suddenly instead of seeking political expansion
and class hegemony" (1987, 58). But [[for
Baudrillard]{.underline}]{.mark} even this seems to be a matter of the
past. [[The socialist project]{.mark} of a class-based revolution [is
ruled out]{.mark} today [because in]{.mark}]{.underline} a world of
[[hyperreality there **cannot be any real classes**]{.mark} to serve as
revolutionary agents]{.underline}. From this perspective, **[[the very
project]{.mark} of socialism [is dissolved]{.mark}]{.underline}**: ["The
social will never have had time to lead to socialism, it will have been
short-circuited by the hypersocial]{.underline}, by the hyperreality of
the social" (1983a, 85). In a world of undifferentiated individuals "the
concept of **[[class will have dissolved]{.underline}]{.mark}**\... into
some parodic, extended double, [like 'the mass of workers' or simply
[into]{.mark} a retrospective [simulation]{.mark} of the
proletariat]{.underline}" (1983a, 86). (278)

#### Group the link turns -- filter your reading of the words "production" and "consumption," "symbolic exchange," and "utility" in all of their cards through this piece of evidence, which is the only one that systematically defines them engages in a comparison with Marx's reading -- Baudrillard's totalizing criticism of the possibility of change is a baseless rejection that destroys politics

To recapitulate, [the ostensible basis for the [shift from production to
consumption in post-al theory is that \"Because it reduces the need for
raw materials, labor and time, space and capital, knowledge becomes the
central resource of the advanced economy]{.mark}]{.underline}\"
(Toffler, Powershift 88). [The advanced, [symbolic economy]{.mark}, in
turn, [creates]{.mark} such socio-cultural [complexities that]{.mark} no
relation of necessity (\"de- termination\") holds any longer among the
highly layered political, cultural and theoretical practices. Each
practice in the social formation [is]{.mark} (semi-)autonomous and thus
[not subject to]{.mark} the laws of an \"outside,\" such as the \"[labor
theory of value]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" In this post-al situation, [th[e
individual is the site of the free play of desire: the alea,
contingency, and differance]{.mark}]{.underline} annul the laws of
motion of labor, and \"[consumption\" becomes the unique expression of
subjectivity as an ever moving, indeterminate and shifting
frontier.]{.underline} In short, the dogma is that \"The Fordist era of
mass-production workers and mass consumers confirmed the sense that
individual interests could be read off with some confidence from the
social blocs formed by production\" (Leadbeater 139). In contrast to the
Fordist regime in which a \"social bloc\" (a code for \'class\"
constructed in the social relations of \"production\") could determine
subjectivity, the post-al scene of the social defies such lavvs of
determi- nation of class and production. Consequently, in the post-al
society, \"[the theatre of consumption has become more important.
[Choice in consumption, lifestyle]{.mark}, sexuality is [more important
as an assertion of identity]{.mark}. The dynamics of most people\'s
lives is where they can assert their difference from
others]{.underline}\" (140). The anti-productionist theories (putting
aside the pop post-ality of Toffler and Gingrich) have a wide
theoretical and political range-from the postmarxist (\"New Times\")
views of Leadbeater, Aronowitz and ludic feminists, and queer theorists
to the speculative philosophical writings of Georges Bataille on
\"general economy.\" In this essay, however, I will focus on the
writings of Baudrillard since I have discussed in great length these
other theories especially the work of Georges Bataille and the role of
his notion of \"general economy\" in the consumptionist theories of
post-ality (Theory and Its Other). I begin with Baudrillard\'s violent
era- sure of what he calls (in The Mirror of Production) the \"spectre
of production.\" \"Today,\" Baudrillard elaborates in his other texts,
\"we are surrounded by there- emergence of \"consumption\" to be \"a
fundamental mutation in the ecology of human species\" (Selected
Writings 29). Since my focus in this text is on the theo- retical issues
rather than historical analysis, I will simply note that Baudrillard\'s
notion that a \"consumer society\" emerged \"today\" is a capitalist
story and an ahistorical fantasy. The pioneering writings of Neil
Kendrick, John Brewer, and J. H. Plumb (The Birth o f Consumer Society:
The Commercialization o f Eighteenth- Century England) as well as the
histories of consumption and consumerism that have been brought out
since the publication of their work in 1982, have clearly
demonstrated-in spite of their historical and theoretical limits-that
consumer society is closely tied to the rise of capitalism and the
regime of profit: the hege- mony of exchange value. [[Baudrillard\'s
\"consumption\"]{.mark} is a totalizing concept and not identical with
the traditional functional consumption of, for example, food for
survival. Rather it is a post-al consumption which is an end in itself,
an articulation of an \"identity\" and an \"individuality[\"]{.mark}
that he believes is an expression of those deeper human needs such as
giving and receiving: not in a causal and exchange circuit but giving
without expecting to receive-that is, for its own sake (pleasure),
prodigality and destruction]{.underline}. His notion of \"destruction\"
as an original human need is a conceptual condensation of the
conservative views of Bataille and Joseph A.Schumpteter\'s economic
writings (Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy) who believed
that\"creative destruction\" and the \"social\" rather than \"economic\"
forces are central to historical change. For Baudrillard
\"[destruction\" means a return to noncommodified and elemental social
relations by removing \"use\" and \"value\" from an object and thus
situating it outside the sphere of causal \"exchange]{.underline}.\" It
is a process that in Forget Foucault (41) he calls \"disaccumulation[.\"
For Baudrillard, [these anti-productionist, anti-utilitarian acts that
affirm the freedom of humans are repressed in capitalism, which is
obsessed with]{.mark} \"use,\" \"[utility]{.mark}\" and \"trade\"
([giving for receiving). The Marxist critique of capitalism, Baudrillard
believes, is inadequate because it \"mirrors\" the capitalist
preoccupation]{.mark} [with production]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is
the embodiment of the control ethos of utility, usefulness and
functionalism-those very beliefs that are, according to him, responsible
for the domination and repres-markable conspicuousness of consumption
and affluence,\" and he regards the on of human beings. [Capitalist
[domination can be terminated]{.mark}, according to Baudrillard, only
[by those practices that place human beings beyond the regime of
exchange and end the rule of utility]{.mark}. He calls the ensemble of
these post-exchange relations, \"[sym- bolic exchange]{.mark}\":
exchanges which are anti-productionist and in the very process of
exchange negate the circuit of exchange]{.underline}. In formulating his
notion of an extra- economic relations, Baudrillard falls back on
Mauss\'s The Gift. In his book, Mauss writes that an awareness of the
practice of gift giving in \"archaic societies\" will resurrect the
\"elemental\" and bring about a radical shift in social life in a way
that \"once again we shall discover \... the joy of giving in public,
the delight in generous artistic expenditure, the pleasure of
hospitality in the public or private feast\" (57). Mauss\'s
interpretation of \"gift\" is part of his larger discontent with
\"economism\": a theme developed in all theories of \"consumption\" and
turned into an axis of inter- pretation of post-al society by Bataille
whose own anti-economistic lessons are the frame of intelligibility of
such post-al theorists as Baudrillard, Derrida, Lyotard and various
post-al marxists. [For Baudrillard, it is through \"symbolic
exchange\"-the gift that places the subject outside economic
relations-and [not class struggle that a genuine revolution is set in
motion and humanity is set free]{.mark}.]{.underline} The symbolic
social relation\" he writes in The Mirror of Production is the
uninterrupted cycle of giving and receiving, which, in primitive
exchange, includes the consumption of the \'surplus\' and deliberate
anti- production whenever accumulation (the thing not exchanged, taken
and not returned, earned and not wasted, produced and not destroyed)
risks breaking reciprocity and begins to generate power. It is this
symbolic relation that the political economy model (of capital), whose
only process is that of laws of value, hence appropriation and
indefinite accumulation, can no longer produce. It is its radical
negation. What is produced is no longer symbolically exchanged and what
is not symbolically exchanged (the commodity) feeds a social relation of
power and exploitation\" (\'143). [This noninstrumental \"consumption\"
is [a semiotic act; \"a system of communicatio]{.mark}n\" (Selected
Writings 46), a mode of forming and disseminating \"mean- ings\" above
and beyond the functionality of consumption]{.underline}. \"A washing
machine serves as equipment and plays as an element of comfort, or of
prestige, etc. It is the field of play that is specifically the field of
consumption\" (Selected Writings 44; emphasis added). When one buys a
pair of \"designer\" jeans, one does not simply respond to a \"need\"
(to keep warm, for instance) but acts on the pulsation of \"desire\": to
express oneself and in doing so become involved in a purposeless
practice [that is essentially an aesthetic act (\"play\"). For
Baudrillard, post-ality is [the articulation of this mode of
consumption]{.mark}: early capitalism is marked by functional
consumption which perpetuates production while post-al capitalism
(\"consumer society\") is a break from this functionalism. Consumption,
in post-al capitalism becomes an end in itself, an \"excessive play: a
sheer \"waste\"-a carnival, a regime of festivities and prodigalities.
Consumption in Baudrillard\'s theory, then, is not determined by such
classical Marxist concepts as \"use-value\" and \"exchange\" value but
by \"sign value]{.underline}.\" The signs and meanings produced through
prodigal expenditure are signs that cannot be easily absorbed back into
the established system of codes that now controls all significations.
[Consumption is both anti- production and anti-regulatory: it is a
process of excessive signification that cannot be contained by the
dominant mode of signification.]{.underline} \"[Conspicuous
consumption\" for Baudrillard is then essentially a resistant semiotic
act-an act of intervention in the order of established meanings and rep-
resentations legitimated by capitalism. Prodigal \"consumption\" is,
according to him, a\' radical negation of capitalism. The act of
consumption therefore is not exhausted by its instrumentality and
usefulness]{.underline} (it is, in terms of his later writings, a mode
of \"seduction\" a form of opposition to production and procreation);
[it is the signifier of an irradicable negative (that cannot be
assimilated in a Marxist dialecti- cal synthesis) and constitutes the
principle of post-al mutation. The form of capital- ism that could be
analyzed in Marxist terms of political economy, Baudrillard maintains,
has ended and, an entirely new analytics that he calls, the \"political
economy of the sign]{.underline}\" (Mirror 121) is needed to make sense
of post-al capitalism. However[, [Baudrillard\'s]{.mark} understanding
of the Marxist concept of \"production\" as a \"mirror\"]{.underline} is
not simply a misrecognition but [is also [ideological in the
sense]{.mark} that the logic of its misrecognition is a class logic: [it
legitimates the (economic) interests of the ruling class. The Marxist
theory of \"production,\" contrary to Baudrillar]{.mark}d]{.underline},
Habermas, Butler, Cornel West and other critics of the \"production
paradigm,\" [[does not reduce all human activities to \"labor\"; rather·
it is a theory of the emancipation of humans from necessity and the
freedom from the capitalist form of labo]{.mark}r. Baudrillard\'s notion
of \"[symbolic exchange\" is simply a post-al colonial nostalgia for
\"primitive\" society; a transhistorical utopia for the]{.mark} North
Atlantic [elite who has freed itself from necessity-at the cost of the
labor of the other-and now regards the main question of humanity to be
not \"production\" but destructive \"consumption.\" For this class, life
is lived ludically]{.mark}: the playfulness that erases the use-value of
the objects of necessity in order to turn them into moments of the
aesthetic sublime.]{.underline} Post-al theories, in general, proclaim
to \"deconstruct\" the metaphysics of labor. Consumptionist theories
after Baudrillard, however, have used the deconstruction of
\"production\" as their foundation for proving the autonomy of capital
from labor and consumption from class/production. One of the main signs
of post-al society, according to Stuart Hall, is that \"there is a
leading role for con- sumption, reflected in such things as greater
emphasis on choice and product dif- ferentiation, on marketing,
packaging and design, on \'targeting\' of consumers by life-style, taste
and culture rather than by the Registrar General\'s categories of so-
cial class\" (\"The Meaning of New Times\" 118). One of the un-saids of
the displace- ment of production by consumption is the notion that
capitalism is a response not to profit but to the \"free choice\"
(desire) of individuals: it is the consumption and desire for difference
that drives capital, and, as such, capitalism is not only not
antagonistic to human needs but is in fact a direct response to them.
\"The private control of the sovereign consumer\" is portrayed in these
reactionary theories as \"real, visible and tangible\" (Mulgan, \"The
Power of the Weak\" 358). Consumption in post-al theory has become the
trope of the indeterminacy of production. [[In its privileging of
\"consumption,\" post-al theory privileges individual \"choice\" over
human \"needs\": it i]{.mark}s, in short, [a class theory]{.mark}. Thus,
[even though the displacement of production is a move made in the name
of epistemological neces- sity-to provide a more accurate knowledge of
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}now-[[it is, in practice, an
ideological alibi for]{.mark} what Hall\'s statement clearly marks: [the
removal of \"class struggle\"]{.mark} from the scene of the social in
the interest of increasing the freedom of choice from the upper middle
classes within the existing socio-economic structures]{.underline}.
These critics [announce the end of socialism and with it [the
outdatedness of the praxis of abolishing private property]{.mark} (that
is, congealed alienated labor) in the post- al moment. Instead of
abolishing private property, they envision an enlightened radical
democracy]{.underline} to supplant socialism las Laclau. Fukuyama,
Mouffe, Cornell West, Aronowitz, Butler and others have advised) and
make property holders of each citizen. [This, needless to say, is the
Thatcherist notion of property-owning democracy]{.underline} represented
as a radical differential socialism. [For theorists of radical
democracy, it is only by means of conspicuous and prodigal \"owning\"
(which en· abies consumption to become transfunctional and symbolic)
that one can be resituated outside the system of exchange and be set
free from the repressive utili- tarianism of capitalism. The \"sign\"
(constructed through conspicuous consump- tion) and not \"labor\" is the
formative force in post-al capitalism, and, therefore, it is the
\"control of the code]{.underline}\" (Mirror 122) [and not seizing of
the means of produc- tion that is the urgent question for political
struggle in the post-al moment.]{.underline} The post-al question, to be
clear, [is [no longer the end of exploitation]{.mark} in the form
ofputting an end to [the extraction of surplus labor]{.mark}
(communism]{.underline}) but a more equi- table distribution
(\"consumption\") among people, regardless of their race, gender,
sexualities, nationalities, of the surplus value produced by the
exploitation of the proletariat.

#### Group their "not our Baudrillard" arguments -- whatever politics they think the aff could result in are mutually exclusive with effective class warfare -- Baudrillard's theory of symbolic exchange says that non-quantifiable signs overdetermine any system of exchange, meaning that the objective analysis and class-based ideology required to orient politics toward the Communist horizon are impossible -- we have a litany of other reasons that the core philosophical tenets undergirding their opaque claims preclude the alt: 

#### \--The fundamental thesis behind their argument rejects production focus 

**Smith 90** \[Tony, Professor of Philosophy at Iowa State, "The
Critique of Marxism in Baudrillard\'s Later Writings," *Rethinking
Marxism*, Spring 1990\]

[Marx's analysis focused on contradictions within **modes of
production**. The most basic]{.underline} [contradiction is that between
the class with a fundamental interest in maintaining the
given]{.underline} [mode of production and the class with a fundamental
interest in attaining a new set of institutions.]{.underline} These
classes are [defined in terms of their place in the system of
production]{.underline}. [The former class appropriates the labor of the
latter, although ideologies will be generated that attempt to mask this
truth]{.underline}. [The latter class is both exploited]{.underline} at
the point of production [and enjoys a precarious]{.underline} and
incomplete [satisfaction of its needs]{.underline}, although here, too,
ideologies will be generated that distort this state of affairs. [In the
capitalist mode of production capital]{.underline} and wage labor form
these two poles. [The task of Marxist theory is to **undermine the
ideologies supporting capital** and to **orient revolutionary struggles
to replace capitalism** with socialism.]{.underline} [For Baudrillard
all of the above is hopelessly out of date]{.underline}. [The Marxist
account]{.underline} utterly [fails to appreciate the specificity of our
postmodern condition. Baudrillard's rejection of Marxism can be
**summarized under four headings**]{.underline}, four ways in which
Baudrillard claims to be beyond Marx. (275-6)

#### \--Symbolic exchange undermines objective basis of class critique 

**Smith 90** \[Tony, Professor of Philosophy at Iowa State, "The
Critique of Marxism in Baudrillard\'s Later Writings," *Rethinking
Marxism*, Spring 1990\]

[Marxist discourse essentially involves truth claims]{.underline} that
are supposedly [grounded by objectively existing referents]{.underline}.
In specific, the theory of needs was a crucial component of Marx's
critique of capitalism[. "Unmet social needs" provided a naturally
existing reference point in terms of which the failures of capitalism
could be objectively measured]{.underline}. In this manner the truth of
the critique could be grounded. [Baudrillard]{.underline}, however,
[rejects the notion that there is some]{.underline} transcendental
[referent for the signs that we use, grounding the truth of our
assertions. He speaks of the "liquidation of all
referentials]{.underline}" (1983b, 4). "[Needs]{.underline}," for
example[, are not natural or given, and thus **cannot ground the truth
of Marxist discourse**]{.underline}. (276)

#### \--Simulation makes critique of ideology impossible 

**Smith 90** \[Tony, Professor of Philosophy at Iowa State, "The
Critique of Marxism in Baudrillard\'s Later Writings," *Rethinking
Marxism*, Spring 1990\]

The concept of [ideology implies that some reality has been falsely
presented]{.underline}. The concept of ideology critique implies that it
is possible to present the truth of that reality[. If reality has been
replaced by hyperreality, and if the notion of truth must be abandoned
along with that of reference]{.underline}, [then it follows at once that
the concepts of **ideology** and **ideology critique** cannot be
retained]{.underline}. [Baudrillard does **not shy away from drawing
this conclusion**]{.underline}. Today "[it is no longer a question of
the false representation of reality (ideology), but of concealing the
fact that the real is no longer real"]{.underline} (1983b, 25).
[Here]{.underline}, too, **[Marxism must be rejected]{.underline}**, for
"[it is always a false problem to want to **restore the truth beneath
the simulacrum**]{.underline}" (1983b, 48). (277)

### at: baudrillard k of marx

#### K of "being productive" conflates utility before and after capitalist modernity -- they reify the modern meaning of "utility" as an expression of DESIRE which is an independent impact turn to their deployment of affect in this round.

**Goux 01** -- (2001, Jean-Joseph, Lawrence Favrot Professor of French
and chair of French Studies at Rice University, "Utility: Equivocation
and Demoralisation," Discourse 23.3 (2001) 3-23)

[Critiquing [utilitarianism]{.mark}]{.underline}, then, [[cannot
mean]{.mark} rising up against [an implicit morality that valorises only
what is strictly necessary]{.mark} according to an]{.underline}
anthropological and naturalist [a priori determination of human
need]{.underline}s, which would be those considered elementary or vital.
[[This form]{.mark} of utilitarianism]{.underline} (which in the extreme
case might lay claim to a certain Aristotelianism or Thomism) **[[is not
only nowhere to be found in political economy]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}, as I have tried to show, **[[a rigorous and
explicit denial of it]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[is at the very
origin]{.mark} of]{.underline} the constitution of [political economy in
its claims to be a science]{.underline}, that is, to be morally
disengaged and indifferent. This claim is strictly and systematically
allied with utilitarianism and which deserves to be investigated in its
own right. [[To critique utilitarianism could only mean to cast
suspicion on the roots]{.underline}]{.mark}, the causes, the contiguous
elements and the end results [[of this]{.mark} emphatic [axiological
indifference]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} radical
and **[[inaugural de-moralization]{.underline}]{.mark}** [which
is]{.underline} perhaps [**not as innocent and disinterested** as it
would like to claim]{.underline}. It is inscribed in a very powerful
structure that is not foreign---I will return to this later---to the
hegemonic logic of the general equivalent.

[Defined extensively in this way, **utility leaves nothing outside
itself**]{.underline}. It suffers no reserve or alternative. The ring
(is it the alliance \[End Page 14\] of symbolic exchange?) or the piece
of lace (metonymy of the superfluous?), the ornament and the monument,
the legendary gadget (of consumer society) or the survival rations of
popular soup, the insolent luxury of the rich and the medicine needed by
the dying man, the stupidly ostentatious detail of a fashion that is as
arbitrary as it is ephemeral and the weapon that kills, the relic of
filial piety and murderous poison---there is nothing that does not enter
into the category of the useful, if only it is at some time or another
desired or sought after by a subjectivity ready to place a price on it
in order to have it or to keep it. If this inventory has a surrealistic
air, in the manner of Lautréamont\'s unforeseen encounters, or if it
seems compatible with an aesthetic of \"anything at all,\" this
compatibility is perhaps not by chance. Like the strange poetic quality
that suddenly infuses Charles Gide\'s style when he writes: \"\[ . . .
\] reasonable, stupid or guilty. bread, diamond or opium. it matters
not.\" This sounds like Baudelaire unmasking the features of modernity.

Neither the attempt by Pareto to avoid the terminological equivocation
of utility by inventing the learned word \"ophelimite\" (from the Greek
ophelimos)---whose coinage as a neologism would exclude all
contamination with ordinary language---nor the attempt by Charles
Gide---who suggested the term \"desirability,\" which, he writes, has
the advantage \"of indicating no prejudice concerning the moral or
immoral, the reasonable or unreasonable character of the desire\"---came
to be accepted. As if the equivocation were not simply a
misunderstanding of vocabulary, but was a necessity and an advantage
rather than a regrettable source of misinterpretation. Must we not
conclude from this persistence that economics draws some profit from
this equivocation? That it is in its interest to create the ambiguity
even as it dissipates it? For is it not this axiological indifference,
at once denied and affirmed, that invents desire as a pure category, as
a subjective, variable, ephemeral desire unchained from every natural,
cosmic or metaphysical order, an autonomized desire disintricated from
that which founds it? Is it not this category of desire, unheard of up
to then, that economics brought forth?

For we would be wrong to see **[[in this imperialism of
utility]{.underline}]{.mark}** thus defined a simple and insignificant
tautology. [[What intervenes]{.underline}]{.mark} here
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a radical operation of de-moralization (but
one which establishes **[[the ontological sovereignty of
\"desire\"]{.underline}]{.mark}**); and it is all the more totalitarian
in that it leaves intact none of the external instances that one might
oppose to it. [The radical notion of utility undoes all the oppositions
that the traditional and normative sense of utility allowed
one]{.underline} \[End Page 15\] [to posit]{.underline}. It has a
deconstructive power in relation to all notions of the type
natural/artificial, reasonable/fanciful, rational/irrational,
necessary/superfluous, serious/frivolous, symbolic/utilitarian,
arbitrary/grounded, noble/ignoble, moral/immoral,
legitimate/illegitimate, and even, paradoxically, useful/harmful.

**[[If we fail to recognize this]{.mark} enveloping force, [we risk
falling short of the true stakes]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which it puts
into play. Baudrillard\'s partial and illusory critique 5 of the notions
of use-value and utility bypasses the more radical operation that is at
issue in the ideology of economic liberalism. [[What is presented as a
ground-shaking discovery]{.underline}]{.mark} ([the inherence of
exchange-value in use-value]{.underline}, the existence of a \"code of
utility,\" etc.) [[that would supposedly confront]{.mark} [the political
economy of]{.mark} use-value and [utility]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [is in
fact **nothing but a consequence** of the rupture which **political
economy itself introduces**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[by means of the
radical notion of utility]{.underline}** (a consequence made more
visible, indeed, by the democratization of \"useless\" consumption).
[[If value can]{.mark} so obviously appear to [escape]{.mark} from a
naturalist and finalist metaphysics of [\"needs,\" to
become]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, a
**[[\"sign-value\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** and to enter into a
differential code of utility like fashion (which I am not contesting),
**[[this is because it was from the beginning]{.underline}]{.mark}** (in
an exemplary way in Condillac), **[[and ever more
clearly]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Say, Jevons, Walras, Pareto, etc.),
**[[exonerated from all predetermined normative and functional
signification]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Not only does this
disjunction]{.mark} **[not contradict a properly economic logic, it is
in perfect agreement with it,]{.mark} is [inherent to it, and]{.mark} is
[foreseen in its constitutive act of
birth]{.mark}**]{.underline}---which consists precisely in this vigorous
gesture of detachment and autonomisation which attempts to liquidate all
theological and naturalist allegiance claiming to determine the needs of
man in general and a priori. Thus the critique of Baudrillard, though it
might work wonders against an Aristotelian or Thomist interpretation of
use (with which, in fact, he credits Marx), in no way touches the
utilitarian base and in fact only serves to confirm its solidity and its
extension. [[Hence]{.underline}]{.mark} the fascination that **[[this
pseudo-critique without alternative]{.underline}]{.mark}** eventually
confesses having for a culture given over to simulacra and seduction,
and in which, following the sound principle affirmed by J.-B. Say,
supply precedes and creates demand.

We can add that [if reflection on luxury]{.underline} (to which every
thinker of the eighteenth century felt obliged to contribute) [soon
disappeared from [economic thought]{.mark}, this is not because the
bourgeoisie was hostile to luxury]{.underline}; [rather]{.underline},
[it is because in constructing the concept of utility **it [went beyond
the opposition between the luxurious and the
necessary]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[[All questions concerning]{.mark}
the [ethical]{.mark} motivation of [expenditure
disappeared]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The fact that the notion of
luxury]{.underline} (and the interrogation of envy, \"jealous vanity,\"
the desire to distinguish \[End Page 16\] oneself from one\'s neighbor,
etc.) [was no longer a preoccupation for the economists of the
nineteenth century]{.underline}, although it had flourished a century
earlier, **[is the simple consequence of the axiological indifference of
economics]{.underline}**. Condillac, for example, although he still
distinguishes between natural and artificial needs (both of which are
seen as determining the value of goods, that is, their \"utility\"),
immediately recognizes the great relativity of this distinction, and
therefore the social and historical relativity of the notion of luxury.
\"**[What is a luxury for one people is not a luxury for
another]{.underline}**; and for the same people, what has been a luxury
may cease to be\" (Le Commerce 90). The most sought after things appear
first as an excess, a luxury, but then gradually come into common usage,
thus attesting to \"progress in the arts.\" Thus Condillac is led to his
own theory of \"sign-value\" and of \"distinction\" when he remarks that
potatoes would be a luxury on our tables if our fields did not produce
them, for then the rich, \"whose taste is in proportion to the rarity of
the dishes, would deem them excellent\" (Le Commerce 192). The price of
what one consumes can therefore be entirely determined by the gaze of
the other. If potatoes were rare, it would indeed be a social sign of
wealth and distinction that one would be eating potatoes, and not only
their nutritive substance. Furthermore, when speaking of a capital city
where wealth abounds and frivolity and fashion reign, Condillac finally
states: \"Caprice gave value \[donnait du prix\] to the most negligeable
things: if you did not enjoy them, you wanted to appear to enjoy them,
because you assumed that other people did\" (Le Commerce 335).
[[**Political economy did not wait for Veblen or the theoreticians of
consumer society** to liberate]{.mark} the notion of [use-value]{.mark}
and utility [from]{.mark} all [naturalist anchorings]{.mark} and to
include the gaze of the other in the intensity of desire]{.underline}.
This is even a systematically a part of its act of birth; and we can see
here the role and the enveloping power of the utilitarian philosophical
base that makes this operation possible.

**[The concept of [utility was constructed to be inclusive enough to
absorb all possible oppositions]{.mark}]{.underline}** (almost all of
which have a moral origin) [between]{.underline} the [necessary
and]{.underline} the [superfluous]{.underline}, between expenditure that
is [reasonable or ruinous]{.underline}, between consumption that is
[serious or frivolous]{.underline}, [thoughtful or
capricious]{.underline}, [functional or fanciful]{.underline}. [This
enlarged concept]{.underline} therefore [dispenses with all meditation
on the moral meaning of consumption]{.underline}, **[[for it has in fact
only one goal: to favor consumption by every
means]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Anything that can be the object of a
demand, whether from elementary necessity or caprice, fantasy, vanity,
fashion, etc., acquires by this very fact a \"utility\" and a
\"use-value.\" It is at the moment when luxury is no longer perceived as
a moral problem and enters into the field of economics that it \[End
Page 17\] also ceases to be a special object for the economist. And it
is quite clear that in this rhetoric of the useful, in this operation of
scientific purification which will claim its ethical indifference in
order better to define its object, it is nothing other than a certain
law of the market that is demanding to be theorized and, finally, in a
subtle form, to be legitimized. The middle ages had its theology and its
casuistry; the modern (and, if we hold to this denomination, the
post-modern) world has its economic science.

#### Baudrillard's K of Marx is just as totalizing as the systems he criticizes, except worse because he basically has zero warrant -- if you don't understand the specific reasoning for their claim, assume it's nonsense

in the Marxist Bath Water?," *Rethinking Marxism: A Journal of
Economics, Culture & Society*, Volume 26, Issue 3, 2014\]

The Problems with Baudrillard\'s Anti-Marxism [Baudrillard has lined up
a number of arguments for abandoning Marxism]{.underline}, and perhaps
as a result, his value theory has not attracted wide attention.
Nevertheless, I will argue both that [we can see some major weaknesses
with the abandonment and also for the potential in his value
theory]{.underline}. Although Smith (1990) dealt with Baudrillard\'s
arguments in MoP, additional consideration is warranted. Before this
attack on Baudrillard\'s late position, I want to highlight that his
transition from Marxism to anti-Marxism does not mean the rejection of
all his previous insights before MoP. It should be noted that the French
subtitle of Mirror of Production is critique du matérialisme historique.
Baudrillard concentrates his attack primarily on historical materialism,
which is only a single part of the Marxian system, although some of the
central tenets of dialectical materialism also get their share of
critique. Baudrillard positions himself beyond needs, beyond truth,
beyond ideology, and beyond revolution. Smith (1990) has convincingly
refuted all these claims by showing that they are either untenable or
tenable but compatible with the writings of Marx. But an important
criticism not mentioned by Smith concerns Baudrillard\'s critique of
historical universalism. The Marxist conceptions of (for example)
history and material production are developed within the temporal
context of capitalism. [Marx conceives history as the history of modes
of production, and thus periods before capitalism can also be analyzed
through production, the concept is no longer temporal, and the Marxist
analysis becomes universal]{.underline} (see Baudrillard 1975, 48).
[Baudrillard objects to this universalism, peculiarly enough by merely
postulating that there were no dialectics in primitive
societies.]{.underline} Poster (1975) rightly points out that this
argument is problematic in several ways. Poster\'s strongest argument
states that, if we accept that applying any contemporary concept to the
past is a kind of universalism, Baudrillard is defeated by his own
argument. Poster observes that Baudrillard\'s texts are infested with
such "universalism." For instance, [his semiotic concepts are
problematic, as he employs them on all stages of human societies without
justification]{.underline}. [Another problem is that Baudrillard has
framed his critique so that it is in **need of empirical
support**]{.underline}. [He **claims** that there are **no longer any
exchange-value transactions untouched by sign values. That begs for
empirical evidence**]{.underline}, and the onus is on Baudrillard, if he
is to be believed, rather than other social scientists. There may be
some nonempirical explanation as to why exchange-value transactions must
be dominated by sign values, but that is not the way Baudrillard frames
the discussion. Instead, [he treats current trends and possibilities as
finalities, treats tendencies as realized states]{.underline} (see
Kellner 1989), **[and extrapolates wildly from interesting
insights]{.underline}** (see Smith 1990). Related to this, [Baudrillard
makes no qualification or delimitation as to the scope of his ideas.
Indeed, he tends to **totalize the system of the society**]{.underline}.
[This is **very problematic** because **totalization** is the germ
source that will cause Baudrillard to r**ule out all political
strategies**]{.underline}, including his own theoretical interventions.
In his later works, Baudrillard positions himself, in Smith\'s (1990)
words, "beyond truth," yet Baudrillard\'s arguments (in particular those
in MoP) are made in such a way as to invite empirical evidence[. He
extrapolates from singular cases in his search for a
strategy.]{.underline} From studies in fashion (CS), goods consumption
(MoP), and French Communist Party activity (UB), Baudrillard wildly
extrapolates that every political activity has one or more sign values
as its objective, making any political activity futile (including even
gifts and Saussurean anagrams). But this is an unwarranted
extrapolation. A political activity that is use-value-oriented is
conceivable, and theorization may also be proffered as an act governed
by use value. A final problem is that [his later theories generally
overlook or neglect many aspects of many people\'s current social
experience]{.underline}. This does not necessarily make the theory
false---but it needs to be taken into account (Kellner 1989). [How does
**Baudrillard respond** to the many third-world workers who feel
**resentment** over their **labor being exploited**]{.underline}?
[According to Baudrillard, they should rather be immersed in
sign-value-related activity,]{.underline} [such as identity
management]{.underline}. [He leaves unarticulated whether the
**perception of social injustice** is exactly that. Before there is
reason to take Baudrillard\'s later standpoints seriously, they need to
be **grounded in empirical investigations**]{.underline}, [or at least
**theoretically justified**.]{.underline} What stands clear from the
analysis of [Baudrillard\'s attack on Marxism is]{.underline} that,
while some of it is relevant, the attack is **[far too
weak]{.underline}** [to justify abandoning his own value theory
altogether]{.underline}---his theory from "within"---from the power of
that analysis alone. [And while Baudrillard simply abandoned Marxism
because he thought that he had proven it completely untenable, there is
**no problem in continuing down the path from which he
diverted**]{.underline}.

#### Their alternative indicts are wild speculation, not rational argument. Class critique is a more effective and sustainable strategy than aff 

**Smith 90** \[Tony, Professor of Philosophy at Iowa State, "The
Critique of Marxism in Baudrillard\'s Later Writings," *Rethinking
Marxism*, Spring 1990\]

[Two questions can be considered]{.underline} under this heading: (a)
[Does Baudrillard present a compelling case against the project of
revolutionary class struggle?]{.underline} (b) [Does he present an
acceptable alternative?]{.underline} (a) We have seen that Baudrillard
holds that the idea of a revolution furthering the interests of the
working classes is senseless today. His argument was that in the age of
hyperreality the very concept of class becomes a "parody," a
"retrospective simulation." [Baudrillard]{.underline} does not really
claim that there are no classes today, but only that class struggle is
useless. He [holds that there is no dialectic within the present
epoch]{.underline} that could possibly point to socialism's being on the
historical agenda. "Once capital itself has become its own myth, or
rather an interminable machine, aleatory, something like a social
genetic code, it no longer leaves any room for a planned reversal; and
this is its true violence" (1987, 112). Arguments for the inevitable
success of socialism are surely suspect. But are arguments for the
inevitability of the failure of socialism any less suspect?
[Baudrillard's case for the thesis that capital "no longer leaves any
room for a planned reversal" appeals to the fact that in the
industrialized West the labor union apparatus has been integrated into
the bourgeois order]{.underline}. "Strikes\...are incorporated like
obsolescence in objects, like crisis in production\... There is no
longer any strikes or work, but\...a scenodrama (not to say melodrama)
of production, collective dramaturgy upon the empty stage of the social"
(1987,48). **[The wild extrapolation here is transparent]{.underline}**.
[From the present relative passivity of the labor movement]{.underline},
[Baudrillard jumps to the conclusion that all capital/wage labor
confrontations in principle can **never be more than the mere simulation
of conflict.**]{.underline} **[He completely rules out]{.underline}**
[in principle any possibility of there ever being dissident movements
within the labor movement that successfully unite workers with
consumers, women, racially oppressed groups, environmental activists,
and so on in a common struggle against capital]{.underline}. [He
completely rules out in principle the possibility of a dynamic unfolding
of this struggle to the point where capital's control of investment
decisions is seriously, called into question.]{.underline} He makes a
wild extrapolation from the fact that these things are not on the agenda
today to the conclusion that in principle they cannot ever occur. [To
say that he **fails to provide any plausible arguments** for such a
strong position is to put things **far too mildly**]{.underline}. **[For
a Marxist]{.underline}**, [capitalism remains a contradictory
system]{.underline}. Baudrillard is correct when he states that some
phenomena of contemporary capitalism make struggles for social change
more difficult (for instance, the proliferation of electronically
transmitted images celebrating hyperconsumerism). However, he fails to
see that such [things are systematically connected to other sorts of
phenomena]{.underline} that may have quite different implications, [such
as increasing stratification]{.underline}, increasing [extraction of
surplus-value through job speed-ups]{.underline}, [environmental
degradation]{.underline}, the gradual [delegitimation of
established]{.underline} political [parties]{.underline}, and so on. [By
overlooking the contradictions]{.underline} that pervade contemporary
capitalism, [Baudrillard is blind to the possibility that capitalism
**remains vulnerable to crises** and to **social movements aiming at its
transformation**]{.underline}. (b) [Baudrillard's
alternatives]{.underline} to organized struggle against capital **[are
hyperconformism and defiance]{.underline}**. Examples of the former
range from yuppies who accumulate the latest electronic gadgets with the
proper demeanor of hip irony, to the crack-dealing B-Boys whose
obsession with designer labels and BMWs simulates the hypermaterialism
of the very system that has destroyed their communities. [Rampant
hyperconformism]{.underline} of this sort [may very well lead the system
to implode]{.underline}, from the waste, environmental damage, and
community disintegration imposed by hyperconsumerism[. The only problem
is that by the time this implosion occurs it may **be too late for the
human species to pick up the pieces**.]{.underline} Baudrillard's
crypto-existentialist odes to defiance perhaps present a more attractive
option. However, [these odes romanticize defeat]{.underline}. They honor
the memory of rebels not for the heroism exemplified in their defeats,
and not for the lessons that can be learned from those defeats. It is
the defeats themselves that meet with Baudrillard's approval, the fact
that the rebels were "acting out (their) own death right a way\...
instead of seeking political expansion and class hegemony." [This form
of implosion is like a fireworks display that brilliantly illuminates
the landscape when it goes off, only to dissolve at once, leaving
everything immersed in darkness as before. And this form of implosion is
an option for suicide]{.underline}. In my view, [neither of
Baudrillard's proposals provides a satisfactory alternative to
revolutionary Marxism]{.underline}, however unfashionable the latter may
be today. (284)

#### Baudrillard's rejection of truth is laughable -- can't undermine all of Marxist theory

**Smith 90** \[Tony, Professor of Philosophy at Iowa State, "The
Critique of Marxism in Baudrillard\'s Later Writings," *Rethinking
Marxism*, Spring 1990\]

[Baudrillard is quite correct to insist that needs are socially and
culturally defined]{.underline}. But [he is mistaken if he believes that
Marx was not aware of this]{.underline}.3 More importantly, [he is wrong
when he extrapolates from this to the conclusion that needs are solely a
matter of codes, systems of signifiers that **refer to no
referent**]{.underline}. In its own way, [the view that states that
human needs have no natural or biological basis is as
one-sided]{.underline}---and therefore false---[as the sociobiology
position that ignores the historical and cultural component of our
nature.]{.underline} Rather than developing this point, however, I would
like to concentrate on Baudrillard's more general claim. [The denial
that we can say anything true]{.underline} about the nature of our needs
[is just a specific case of a **general rejection of the referent**, a
rejection of our being able to formulate truth claims regarding the
signified in language.]{.underline} Let us consider some of the examples
Baudrillard discusses. Baudrillard has a very plausible insight into the
Watergate saga of the Nixon era. The Washington Post employed precisely
the same undercover methods in breaking the story as the Nixon
administration employed in planning the initial break-ins. Also, the
source for the Post\'s stories, "Deep Throat," may well have been
someone within the Nixon administration itself. All of this is
interesting enough. But [at this point Baudrillard heads for the
stratosphere, and extrapolates from the fact that in this case we may
never know the truth of the matter to the conclusion that the very
category of "truth" must be abandoned]{.underline} (1983b, 26-27). Or
take another of Baudrillard's cases: In the Franco years Franco ordered
the public execution of some Basque nationalists. Baudrillard points out
that this was Franco's gift to Western Europe. Western Europe could
piously complain about Franco, thereby indulging in pompous and
pointless self-congratulations regarding its own liberalism. And this
response was, in turn, Western Europe's gift to Franco. The attacks on
Spain allowed him to solidify his own rule by appealing to Spanish
national unity. It is certainly true that in this complex web is it hard
to distinguish posturing from the facts of the matter. But [Baudrillard
derives a much stronger conclusion: "Where is the truth in all that,
when such collusions admirably knit together without their authors ever
knowing it?"]{.underline} (1983b, 34). [This implies that the category
"truth" would only have validity if states of affairs corresponded to
the subjective intentions of the social actors who brought them
about.]{.underline} This is surely a wild extrapolation. [Baudrillard
himself has illuminated at least an essential part of the truth of this
situation, and so he is hardly in a position to claim that this sort of
situation undermines the category of truth]{.underline}. [Anyone
deriving this conclusion from the case being considered ought to feel
dizzy]{.underline}. But anyone attempting to reject on these grounds a
theory such as Marx's that makes truth claims ought to think twice. Two
more general points can be made here. First, [Baudrillard presupposes
that a cognitive validity claim necessarily implies a claim to possess
absolute truth. This does not follow. One can hold a fallibilist
epistemology while rejecting Baudrillard's complete abandonment of the
concept of "truth]{.underline}." Second[, Habermas has considered a
number of postmodern thinkers who have followed Nietzsche in abandoning
the notion of trut]{.underline}h (1987). He has shown that **[none of
them has avoided self-referential paradox]{.underline}**. **[They all
assert as true that there is no truth]{.underline}**. [Baudrillard must
be added to this list]{.underline}.4 (280-2)

#### Move to hyperreality/simulation proves fundamentals of marxism correct 

**Smith 90** \[Tony, Professor of Philosophy at Iowa State, "The
Critique of Marxism in Baudrillard\'s Later Writings," *Rethinking
Marxism*, Spring 1990\]

Baudrillard begins with an interesting insight. [Capitalism has indeed
become so productive that the danger of producing commodities that are
not absorbed by the market is ever present.]{.underline} This means that
[great effort must continually be made to create demand for]{.underline}
[products]{.underline}. [When products are cultural signs the demand for
them will not be limited by any functional use those products may
have]{.underline}. In this sense, there is no longer any sphere of
production separate from the sphere of culture.2 From this observation
[Baudrillard extrapolates to the claims that any attempt to consider
production independently of culture is mistaken]{.underline}. A number
of things can be noted in response. First, [producers for the market
have always had to concern themselves with demand manipulation, which
typically occurs through appeal to cultural images]{.underline}. [Marx
was well aware that production is ultimately interconnected with
consumption in this manner]{.underline}: "The needs of consumption
determine production. Mutual interaction takes place between the
different moments" (Marx 1973, 100). Second, it is true that the modes
of demand manipulation have shifted with the evolution of electronic
media. However, it does not necessarily follow that the consumption of
images is now more crucial to the present stage of capital than the
production of material products. After all, the very hyperreality of
which Baudrillard speaks requires a vast expansion of material
production. Television sets, VCRs, satellites, satellite discs, and so
on, must all be produced. Finally, [we cannot extrapolate from the new
forms of demand manipulation to the conclusion that the question of the
ownership and control of the means of production is not of crucial
significance]{.underline}. There is a tremendous concentration of
capital in the ownership and control of the means of producing messages.
Robert Maxwell and Rupert Murdoch have created global media empires that
spread through book, magazine, and newspaper publishing, TV station
ownership, TV program planning, cable TV network ownership, satellite TV
distribution, and electronic hardware production. Time and Warners have
merged into a media conglomerate with revenues of \$10 billion a year.
The next Madonna wannabe will be signed by Wamers, given an HBO special,
reviewed in Time, and appear on the cover of People in a hyperreal
blitz, all as a result of a decision made by headquarters in New York.
Surely a consideration of such matters cannot be avoided if we wish to
understand the dynamics of our hyperreal postmodern world. [Baudrillard
cannot possibly provide any sort of argument that his thought leads us
beyond Marx's concern with the ownership and control of the means of
production.]{.underline} [Marxism has not suddenly become outdated with
the rise of the electronic mass media. The age of hyperreality confirms
Marx's essential insight that the concentration and centralization of
control of the means of production is inherent in the logic of capital,
and that this generates alien social forces standing above the members
of society]{.underline}. (279-80)

#### Marx better understands the nature of reality- Baudrillard's theories are logically untennable

**Smith 90** \[Tony, Professor of Philosophy at Iowa State, "The
Critique of Marxism in Baudrillard\'s Later Writings," *Rethinking
Marxism*, Spring 1990\]

[Marx's category of ideology depends upon there being an underlying
reality that has been masked. In]{.underline} the age of
[hyperreality]{.underline}, however, **[Baudrillard insists that this
cannot be the case.]{.underline}** [When it comes to]{.underline} the
question of [social reality, there is no doubt that Baudrillard once
again begins with an important insight]{.underline}.
[Baudrillard's]{.underline} notion of [simulacrum]{.underline}
tremendously [illuminates our contemporary fate]{.underline}. An Italian
girl from Michigan with a fairly ordinary voice has become an icon
because of her sophisticated manipulation of the signs of sexuality in
countless5 MTV videos. The producers of colored sugarwater have built
vast corporate empires by associating sugarwater with the signs of youth
in endlessly repeated commercials. In both cases, these signs do not
refer back to the commodity in question; they refer to nothing at all.
And yet they are more real than real; they are hyperreal. [Baudrillard
is at his best when he shows how contemporary politics is also nothing
but a series of meaningless simulations]{.underline}. "Propaganda and
advertising fuse in the same marketing and merchandising of objects and
ideologies" (1983b, 125). A better description than his of our
Redemopublicratic system could not be given: "Simulation of opposition
between two parties, absorption of their respective objectives,
reversibility of the entire discourse one into the other" (1983b, 133).
[Politics too has been taken over by the hyperreal. Consider the manner
in which Bush wrapped himself in the American flag. What did this
signify? To what did it refer? There was no reality to which his
employment of the flag as sign referred, and yet the employment of the
flag as sign had a reality of its own. In fact it, too, was more real
than real; it was hyperreal]{.underline}. Or consider the Willie Horton
ads. Those ads functioned as signs that were clearly designed to be
perceived as referring to hordes of black rapists leniently treated by
liberal administrators. But the social effect of those ads, those
signifiers, had nothing whatsoever to do with the question of whether or
not there was any real signified to which they referred. The only thing
that mattered was that they were taken to refer to the real. In this
sense, the ads took on a power that made them more than real. [They also
created a hyperreality]{.underline}. [We are surrounded by signs that
have profound effects in the social world without referring to anything
rea]{.underline}l. In forcing us to confront this Baudrillard makes a
significant contribution to contemporary social theory. But he is not
content to leave things there. Instead, [he pushes the wild
extrapolation button and comes up with the thesis that the **very notion
of reality** must be abandoned now that we have entered the epoch of the
simulacrum]{.underline}. The "decisive turning point" that marks our age
is "the transition from signs which dissimulate something to signs which
dissimulate that there is nothing" (1983b, 12). This induces the
sought-for dizziness, but it does so at the cost of coherence. In order
to know that Bush's appeal to the flag created a hyperreality rather
than referring to anything real about Bush, one must already know that
in reality Bush's career as a Texas oilman, CIA director, and Vice
President reflects a commitment to values quite different from those
meant to be invoked through association with the flag. In order to know
that the Willie Horton ads created a hyperreality rather than referring
to anything real in the social world, one must already know that in
reality the myth of the black rapist is just that, a myth (Davis 1983),
and that in reality the U.S. legal system is guilty of massive and
systematic discrimination against black males. [The category of
hyperreality thus cannot be a replacement for the concept of reality as
Baudrillard holds]{.underline}. [We must presuppose the validity of the
latter category in order to determine instances where the former term is
exemplified. The signs around us do not hide from us that there is
nothing; they hide from us that Madonna's poses oversimplify human
sexuality]{.underline}, that Pepsi is colored sugarwater, that Bush is a
hypocrite and a racist. [These signs distort and mask an underlying
reality, a reality that thought in principle can
appropriate]{.underline}, as many of Baudrillard's own writings show.[6
This implies that the age of simulacra is **another stage** within the
**age of ideology** and not some **radically new epoch** where the
**Marxist concept of ideology has become irrelevant.**]{.underline}

### link -- gender

#### Capitalism polices identity along gendered and sexual lines---identity politics based on intersectional theories serve to atomize resistance and limit the potential for abolishing alienated labor itself

**Mitchell 13** \[12/2, Eve, "I Am a Woman and a Human: A
Marxist-Feminist Critique of Intersectionality Theory", Unity and
Struggle began in 2003 among a number of activists primarily involved in
anti-Israeli apartheid work. Searching for a means to deepen our
association and build on our experiences we formed a small grouping of
people, which provided the basis for further discussion and support
organizing in other areas important to us. Some of the areas of work we
are or have been involved in include labor, anti-budget cuts in the
schools, anti-racist, anti-apartheid, queer liberation work, as well as
around public transportation.
http://unityandstruggle.org/2013/09/12/i-am-a-woman-and-a-human-a-marxist-feminist-critique-of-intersectionality-theory/\]

[In order to understand "identity" and "intersectionality theory," we
must have an understanding of the movement of capital]{.underline}
(meaning the total social relations of production in this current mode
of production) that led to their development in the 1960s and 1970s in
the US. More specifically, [since "intersectionality theory" primarily
developed in response to second wave feminism, we must look at how
gender relations under capitalism developed. [In the movement from
feudalism to cap]{.mark}italism, the gendered division of labor, and
therefore gender relations]{.underline} within the class began to take a
new form that [corresponded to the needs of capital. Some of these [new
relations included the following: (1) The]{.mark} development of the
[wage]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The wage is the capitalist form of
coercion. As Maria Mies explains in her book, Patriarchy and
Accumulation on a World Scale, [the wage replaced serf and slave
ownership]{.underline} as the method [to coerce alienated
labor]{.underline} (meaning labor [that the worker does for someone
else]{.underline}). Under capitalism, those who produce (workers) do not
own the means of production, so they must go to work for those who own
the means of production (capitalists). Workers must therefore sell the
only thing they own, their ability to labor, or their labor power, to
the capitalist. This is key because workers are not paid for their
sensuous living labor, the act of producing, but the ability to labor.
The labor-labor power split gives rise to the appearance of an equal
exchange of value; it appears as though the worker is paid for the
amount of value she produces but in essence she is paid only for her
ability to labor for a given period of time. Furthermore, the working
day itself is split into two parts: necessary labor time and surplus
labor time. Necessary labor time is the time it takes the worker (on
average) to produce enough value to buy all the commodities he needs to
reproduce himself (everything from his dinner to his iPhone). Surplus
labor time is the time the worker works beyond the necessary labor time.
Since the going rate for labor power (again, our capacity to labor --
not our actual living labor) is the value of all the commodities the
worker needs to reproduce herself, [[surplus labor is value that goes
straight into the capitalist's pocket]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example,
let's say I work in a Furby factory. I get paid \$10 a day to work 10
hours, I produce 10 Furbies a day, and a Furby is worth \$10 each. The
capitalist is only paying me for my ability to work 1 hour each day to
produce enough value to reproduce myself (1 Furby = 1 hour's labor =
\$10). So my necessary labor time is 1 hour, and the surplus labor time
I give to the capitalist is 9 hours (10-1). [[The wage obscures
this]{.mark} fact. Recall that under capitalism, [it appears as though
we are paid]{.mark} the equivalent value of [what we
produce]{.mark}]{.underline}. But, in essence, we are paid only for our
necessary labor time, or the minimum amount we need to reproduce
ourselves. This was different under feudalism when it was very clear how
much time humans spent working for themselves, and how much time they
spent working for someone else. For example, a serf might spend five
hours a week tilling the land to produce food for the feudal lord, and
the rest of her time was her own. The development of the wage is key
because it enforced a gendered division of labor. [[(2) A separation of
production and reproduction]{.underline}]{.mark}. Along with commodity
production came a separation between production and reproduction. To be
clear, [["reproduction"]{.underline}]{.mark} does not solely refer to
baby making. It also [[includes meeting]{.mark} the]{.underline} many
[[various needs]{.underline}]{.mark} we have [under capitalism, [from
cooking]{.mark}]{.underline} food and cleaning the home, to listening to
a partner vent about their shitty day and holding their hand, [[to
caring for the]{.underline}]{.mark} young, [[sick]{.underline}]{.mark},
elderly and disabled members of society. [[As cap]{.mark}italism
[developed]{.mark},]{.underline} generally speaking,
[[productive]{.underline}]{.mark} (value-producing) [[labor corresponded
to the wage, and reproductive labor was unwaged]{.underline}]{.mark} (or
extremely low waged), [[since in appearance it produced no
surplus]{.mark} value]{.underline} for the capitalist. This separation,
characterized by the wage, took on a specific gendered form under
capitalism. [Women were largely excluded from productive sphere and
therefore did not receive a wage]{.underline} for the reproductive work
they did. [[This gave men a certain]{.mark} amount of
[power]{.mark}]{.underline} over women, [[and created
antagonisms]{.mark} within the class based on a gendered division of
labor. Silvia [Federici]{.mark}]{.underline}, in Caliban and the Witch,
[[calls this the "patriarchy of the wage"]{.underline}]{.mark} (97-100).
[[(3)]{.mark} The contradictory development of the nuclear
family.]{.underline} With the development of capitalism and large-scale
industry, the content of the nuclear family took a contradictory turn.
[On the one hand,]{.underline} as pointed out by theorists such as Selma
James and Mariarosa Dalla Costa in "The Power of Women and the
Subversion of the Community," [[the nuclear family was strengthened
by]{.mark} the [gendered division of labor]{.mark}]{.underline}
characterized by the wage. [Women and children]{.underline}
[were]{.underline} excluded from the wage and [relegated to reproductive
work; men received a wage and were relegated to productive
work.]{.underline} This meant that men needed women and children to
reproduce them, and women and children needed men to bring in a wage to
reproduce the family as a whole (of course this wage was sometimes
supplemented by a woman's low wage earnings as a domestic or other paid
reproductive worker). And so on the one hand, the development of
capitalism strengthened the nuclear family. [[On the other
hand]{.underline}]{.mark}; however, capitalist relations also undermined
the nuclear family. As James and Dalla Costa point out, [[the gendered
division of labor is:]{.underline}]{.mark} "rooted in the framework of
capitalist society itself: [[women at home and men in the
factories]{.underline}]{.mark} and office, separated from the other the
whole day ... [[Cap]{.mark}ital, [while it elevates heterosexuality to a
religion,]{.mark} at the same time in practice [makes it
impossible]{.mark}]{.underline} for men and women to be in touch with
each other, physically or emotionally --- it undermines heterosexuality
as a sexual, economic, and social discipline" (James, Sex, Race and
Class, 56). [[(4) The development of "identity" and alienation]{.mark}.
John D'Emilio runs with this concept]{.underline} of the contradictory
development of the nuclear family, arguing that "gay identity" (and we
can infer "female identity") as a category developed through this
contradictory movement of the nuclear family. He argues for a
distinction between gay behavior and gay identity, [stating, "There
was]{.underline}, quite simply, [no 'social space']{.underline} in the
colonial system of production [that allowed men and women to be
gay.]{.underline} Survival was structured around participation in the
nuclear family. There were certain homosexual acts --- sodomy among men,
'lewdness' among women --- in which individuals engaged, but family was
so pervasive that colonial society lacked even the category of
homosexual or lesbian to describe a person ... By the second half of the
nineteenth century, this situation was noticeably changing as the
capitalist system of free labor took hold. [[Only when individuals began
to make their living through wage labor,]{.mark} instead of parts of an
interdependent family unit, [was it possible for]{.mark} homosexual
[desire to coalesce into a personal identity]{.mark}]{.underline} --- an
identity based on the ability to remain outside the heterosexual family
and to construct a personal life based on the attraction to one's own
sex" ("Capitalism and the Gay Identity," 104-105). D'Emilio's
understanding of "identity" is key for understanding identity politics
and intersectionality theory; however, I would slightly change his
framework. [In distinguishing between "behavior," and "identity,"
D'Emilio is touching on]{.underline} what could be broadened out to the
[Marxist categories, "labor" and "alienation."]{.underline} I digress in
order to fill out this idea. For Marx, labor is an abstract category
that defines human history. In his early texts, Marx refers to labor as
self- or life-activity. In "Estranged Labour," Marx writes, "For in the
first place labour, life-activity, productive life itself, appears to
man merely as a means of satisfying a need --- the need to maintain the
physical existence. Yet the productive life is the life of the species.
It is life-engendering life. The whole character of a species --- its
species character --- is contained in the character of its life
activity; and free conscious activity is man's species character. Life
itself appears only as a means to life" (76). Life-activity, or labor,
is an abstraction that transcends a specific form, or a specific mode of
production (capitalism, feudalism, tribalism, etc.). However, labor can
only be understood within the context of these forms; [it is
through]{.underline} these forms, [the social organization of our labor,
that humans engage in the ever-expanding process of satisfying our
needs]{.underline}, introducing new needs, and developing new ways of
fulfilling our needs. [[Labor encompasses everything from our
jobs]{.mark} under capitalism to tilling the land under feudalism, [to
creating]{.mark} art and [poetry, to]{.mark} having [sex]{.mark} and
raising children]{.underline}. Through labor and its many expressions,
or forms, we engage with the world around us, changing the world and
changing ourselves in the process. [[Under cap]{.mark}italism, [there is
a separation between our labor and our conscious
will]{.mark}]{.underline}. When Marx says "Life itself appears only as a
means to life," he is pointing toward this contradiction. As noted
above, under capitalism, labor is divorced from the means of production
so we must work for those who own the means of production. We engage in
the same form of labor all day every day, and we receive a wage for this
activity in order to exchange to meet our needs. We produce value in
order to exchange for the use-values we need to survive. So what appears
under capitalism as a mere means to satisfy our needs (work), is in
essence the activity of life itself (labor). [[Because of this
schism]{.mark} between our labor and our conscious will, our
[labor]{.mark} under capitalism [is alienated,]{.mark} meaning it is not
used for our own enrichment, instead, [we give it away to the
capitalist]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our multi-sided labor becomes
one-sided; [our labor is reduced to work.]{.underline} In "The German
Ideology," Marx writes, "as soon as the distribution of labour comes
into being, each man has a particular, exclusive sphere of activity,
which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape. He is a
hunter, a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical critic, and must remain
so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood" (53). We are not
fully enriched human beings, engaging in all forms of labor we wish to
engage in, we are relegated into one form of labor in order to exchange
to meet our needs. We are call center workers, hair stylists, nurses,
teachers, etc. This one-sidedness, as the precondition for meeting our
needs, is unique to the capitalist mode of production. In applying
Marx's categories to D'Emilio's explanation of homosexuality, we could
say that homosexual behaviors are an expression of labor, or
self-activity, and homosexual identity is a one-sided, alienated form of
labor unique to capitalism. It distinguishes the difference between a
person who consciously engages in homosexual acts, and one who is
defined by one form of labor: a homosexual. [Women and people of color
experience something similar in the development of capital; a shift from
engaging in certain types of labor to engaging in feminized, or racially
relegated forms of labor. To put it another way, [under
cap]{.mark}italism, [we are forced into a box]{.mark}: we are [a bus
driver, or a hair stylist, or a woman. These different forms]{.mark} of
labor, or different expressions of]{.underline} our life-activity ([the
way]{.underline} in which [we interact]{.underline} with the world
around us) [[limit our ability to be multi-sided]{.mark} human
beings]{.underline}. [[There were]{.mark}]{.underline} plenty of
[homosexual acts, [many forms of gender expression, and some divisions
based on skin color in pre-capitalist societies. But "identity" as an
individualistic category is unique to cap]{.mark}italism]{.underline}.
[[If we understand "identity" in this way, we will struggle for a
society that does not limit us as "bus drivers,"]{.mark} "women," or
"queers," [but]{.mark} a society that [allows everyone to freely use
their multi-sided life]{.mark} activity]{.underline} in whatever ways
they want. In other words, we will struggle for a society that
completely abolishes, or transcends, "identities." I will explain more
on this later. What is Intersectionality Theory and How Did it Develop?
The term "intersectionality" did not become commonplace until the early
1980s. According to most feminist historians, Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw
was the first to coin the term, in a series of articles written between
roughly 1989 and 1991 (for example, see "Mapping the Margins").
[Intersectionality theory]{.underline} [was]{.underline} then
[popularized by many critical race and gender theorists.]{.underline}
Despite where [the term]{.underline} was coined, intersectionality
theory [has its roots in the 1960s and 70s class struggle
movements]{.underline} in the US and Europe (roughly speaking). This
period was generally [characterized by autonomous struggles based on the
gendered and racialized division of labor. Black folks were]{.underline}
the vanguard of this form of struggle, [developing]{.underline} and
leading many types of [organizations from revolutionary parties like the
Black Panther Party, to majority black workplace organizations like the
Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement]{.underline}. These forms of struggle
influenced other groups, such as white women, latinos, gays and
lesbians, to form similar organizations along race, gender and sexuality
lines ([while there were multi-ethnic projects in this]{.underline} time
[period]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} many [contradictions within
these organizations themselves,]{.underline} it can be said that in this
specific time and place, [there was a]{.underline} general [tendency to
organize along these lines). This was due to the gendered and racialized
division of labor]{.underline}; black folks were relegated to certain
neighborhoods and certain forms of labor, the value of a black person's
labor was less than a white person's, and a socially constructed skin
color hierarchy and corresponding antagonisms within the class was fully
developed and materially enforced. [To be black meant to be objectified,
relegated into one form of labor: producing and reproducing blackness.
Black Power was therefore the struggle against the alienation and
one-sidedness of blackness]{.underline}, a struggle to liberate labor,
releasing its multi-sidedness, [unifying labor with its conscious
will]{.underline}. [Similarly, women organized in response to the
gendered division of labor]{.underline} in effort to break free from the
alienation of "womanhood." For example, women struggled for reproductive
[and]{.underline} sexual freedom in effort [to gain control
over]{.underline} the means of production ([their bodies]{.underline}).
Maria Mies describes how women's bodies are their means of production
under capitalism, stating, "The first means of production with which
human beings act upon nature is their own body," and later, she writes,
"women can experience their whole body, not only their hands or their
heads. Out of their body they produce new children as well as the first
food for these children" (Patriarchy and Accumulation on a World Scale,
52 and 53). Since women's use of their bodies is a unique form of
alienated labor for women under capitalism, it is historically the site
of struggle for liberation. However, there was also a tendency within
second wave feminism that sought to reproduce capitalist relations,
arguing for "equal wages for equal work." Both of these tendencies were
acting in response to the gendered social relations under capital, and
[both shared a methodology of identity politics]{.underline}, arguing
that women could unite on the basis of a shared "woman" experience, or
"womanhood." [From this development, [intersectionality]{.mark} theory
took hold.]{.underline} As the autonomous struggles of the 60s and 70s
began to recede, groups like the Combahee River Collective responded to
the material divisions within the movement. [They [argued that
the]{.mark} objectively [white second wave]{.mark} feminist movement
[excluded women of color by assuming]{.mark}]{.underline} the white
woman's experience could be extended to women of color, and [that [white
women were adequate spokespeople]{.mark} for women of color. In
contrast, [they argued]{.mark} that a [revolutionary praxis must be
informed by]{.mark} the experience of [black lesbian women, stating,
"This]{.mark}]{.underline} focusing upon our own oppression [[is
embodied in]{.mark} the concept of [identity
politics.]{.mark}]{.underline} We believe that the most profound and
potentially most radical politics come directly out of our own identity,
as opposed to working to end somebody else's oppression. In the case of
Black women this is a particularly repugnant, dangerous, threatening,
and therefore revolutionary concept because it is obvious from looking
at all the political movements that have preceded us that anyone is more
worthy of liberation than ourselves" ("Combahee River Collective
Statement"). What developed in practice through the Combahee River
Collective's specific set of identity politics (a black, lesbian,
working class-based politics) was solidified theoretically with the
development of intersectionality theory. [The intersectionality
[theorists]{.mark}]{.underline} who emerged in the late 70s and early
80s rightly [[expressed]{.mark} antagonisms]{.underline} within the
class, [arguing [that one cannot discuss gender without discussing race,
class, sexuality, disability, age, etc.]{.mark}]{.underline} Patricia
Hill Collins describes intersectionality theory as an "analysis claiming
that systems of race, social class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity,
nation, and age form mutually constructing features of a social
organization, which shape Black women's experiences and, in turn, are
shaped by Black Women" (Black Feminist Thought, 299). Using this
definition and the prominent intersectionality theorists' writings, I
have identified four core components of the theory: (1) a politics of
difference, (2) a critique of women's organizations and people of color
organizations, (3) the need to develop the most oppressed as leaders and
take the leadership from them, and (4) the need for a politics that
takes all oppressions into account. (1) A politics of difference.
Intersectionality theorists argue that our various identities, such as
race, class, gender, sexuality, etc., necessarily differentiate us from
people who do not have those identities. So a ruling class, gay, black
man will have a different experience, and therefore, a different
politics, than a straight, white, working class woman. On the other
hand, people with shared identities, such as being black or lesbian,
will have a shared experience that organically unites the individuals.
Some of these shared identities are more likely to unite some people
than others. As Collins explains, "On the one hand, all African-American
women face similar challenges that result from living in a society that
historically and routinely derogates women of African descent. Despite
the fact that U.S. Black women face common challenges, this neither
means that individual African-American women have all had the same
experiences nor that we agree on the significance of our varying
experiences. Thus, on the other hand, despite the common challenges
confronting U.S. Black women as a group, diverse responses to these core
themes characterize U.S. Black women's group knowledge or standpoint.
Despite differences of age, sexual orientation, social class, region,
and religion, U.S. Black women encounter societal practices that
restrict us to inferior housing, neighborhoods, schools, jobs, and
public treatment and hide this differential consideration behind an
array of common beliefs about Black women's intelligence, work habits,
and sexuality. These common challenges in turn result in recurring
patterns of experiences for individual group members" (25). This is a
cornerstone of intersectionality theory: some individuals or groups are
differentiated from other individuals or groups based on their
experiences. This can be cut along many different identity lines. (2)
Critiques of women's organizations and people of color organizations.
Women of color were marginalized in the 1960s and 70s women's, Black
Power, Chicanismo, and other people of color-led organizations. Most
intersectionality theorists attribute this to a unique experience women
of color (and particularly Black women) have around race, class, gender,
and other forms of oppression. For example, Collins argues that women of
color have abstained from joining white feminist organizations on the
grounds that they have been "racist and overly concerned with White,
middle-class women's issues" (5). Similarly, Collins argues that black
studies is traditionally based on a "male-defined ethos," and contains a
"predominantly masculinist bias" (7), despite historically joining and
feeling marginalized in African American organizations. Again, this is
an objective and historical situation that intersectionality theorists
attribute to difference along identity lines. (3) The need to develop
the most oppressed as leaders, and take leadership from them. Following
this analysis, [intersectionality theorists argue that the
experience]{.underline} of being an oppressed person [places individuals
in a uniquely privileged position for struggle]{.underline}. In other
words, [if you've experienced the]{.underline} multiple, identity-based
[oppressions, you are the vanguard of the struggle against it. bell
[hooks writes,]{.mark}]{.underline} "As a group, black women are in an
unusual position in this society, for not only are we collectively at
the bottom of the occupational ladder, but our overall social status is
lower than that of any other group. Occupying such a position, we bear
the brunt of sexist, racist, and classist oppression. At the same time,
we are the same group that has not been socialized to assume the role of
exploiter/oppressor in that we are allowed no institutional "other" that
we can exploit or oppress ... Black women with no institutionalized
"other" that we may discriminate against, exploit, or oppress, often
have a lived experience that directly challenges the prevailing
classist, sexist, and racist social structure and its concomitant
ideology. This lived experience may shape our consciousness in such a
way that our world view differs from those who have a degree of
privilege (however relative within the existing system). [[It is
essential]{.mark} for continued feminist struggle that [black women
recognize the special vantage point our marginality gives us]{.mark} and
make use of this perspective to]{.underline} criticize the dominant
racist, classist, sexist hegemony as well as to envision and [create a
counter-hegemony]{.underline}" (Feminist Theory from Margin to Center,
16). This point justifies the need to develop queer, women, and people
of color as movement leaders, and allows intersectionality theorists to
explain why historically the most oppressed tend to be the most
militant. (4) The need for a politics that takes all oppressions into
account. [[Finally]{.mark}, all [intersectionality theorists argue the
need to analyze every form of oppression, using the terms, "interlocking
system]{.mark} of oppressions,"]{.underline} "matrix of domination," [or
some variation]{.underline} thereof. The idea is that it is impossible
to view one identity or category of oppression without looking at all
the others. As Barbara Smith simply puts, "the major 'isms' ... are
intimately intertwined" (The Truth that Never Hurts: Writings on Race,
Gender, and Freedom, 112); they cannot be separated. While
intersectionality theory seems to overcome the limitations of identity
politics, it falls short. The next section will show how
[[intersectionality]{.mark} theory [is]{.mark}, in fact, [a bourgeois
ideology]{.mark}.]{.underline} A Marxist Critique of Identity Politics
and Intersectionality Theory. Identity politics is rooted in a one-sided
expression of capitalism, and is therefore not a revolutionary politics.
As noted earlier, [["identity" can be equated with alienated labor; it
is a one-sided expression of our]{.mark} total [potential]{.mark} as
human beings]{.underline}. Frantz Fanon discusses something similar in
the conclusion to Black Skin White Masks. He writes, "The black man,
however sincere, is a slave to the past. But I am a man, and in this
sense the Peloponnesian War is as much mine as the invention of the
compass" (200 -- Philcox Translation, 2008). [On the one hand, Fanon
points to a particular, one-sided expression: blackness. On the other
hand, he points toward the multi-sides of a potentially universal
human.]{.underline} Fanon is at once both of these things: a black man,
and a man (or, more generally, a human); a particular and a universal.
[Under capitalism, we are both the alienated worker and labor itself,
except the universal has not been actualized concretely.]{.underline}
The identity politics of the 60s and 70s conflates a particular moment,
or a determinant point, in the relations of capitalism with the
potential universal. Furthermore, it reproduces the schism between
appearance and essence. Under capitalism there is a contradiction
between the particular and the universal; appearance and essence. We
appear to be alienated individuals (a bus driver, a hair stylist, a
woman, etc.), though in essence we are multi-sided individuals capable
of many forms of labor. [Identity politics bolsters one side of this
contradiction, arguing for collective struggle on the basis of
"womanhood," or "blackness," or "black lesbianhood," etc.]{.underline}
To borrow from Fanon, identity politics states, "I am a black man," "I
am a woman," or "I am a black lesbian," etc. [This is a key first
step]{.underline}. As he writes in his critical chapter, "The Lived
Experience of the Black Man:" "I finally made up my mind to shout my
blackness" (101), "On the other side of the white world there lies a
magical black culture. Negro sculpture! I began to blush with pride. Was
this our salvation?" (102), and "So here we have the Negro
rehabilitated, 'standing at the helm,' governing the world with his
intuition, rediscovered, reappropriated, in demand, accepted; and it's
not a Negro, oh, no, but the Negro, alerting the prolific antennae of
the world, standing in the spotlight of the world, spraying the world
with his poetical power, 'porous to the every breath in the world.' I
embrace the world! I am the world! The white man has never understood
this magical substitution. The white man wants the world; he wants it
for himself. He discovers he is the predestined master of the world. He
enslaves it. His relationship with the world is one of appropriation.
But there are values that can be served only with my sauce. As a
magician I stole from the white man a 'certain world,' lost to him and
his kind. When that happened the white man must have felt an aftershock
he was unable to identify, being unused to such reactions" (106-107).
For several pages, [[Fanon argues that black people must]{.mark} embrace
blackness, and [struggle on the basis of being black,]{.mark} in order
[to negate white supremacists]{.mark} social relations. [But to stop
there reproduces our one-sided existence]{.mark} and the forms of
appearance of capitalism. [Identity politics argues,]{.mark} "I am a
black man," or ["I am a woman," without filling out the other side of
the contradiction "...and]{.mark} I am [a human."]{.mark}]{.underline}
If the starting and ending point is one-sided, there is no possibility
for abolishing racialized and gendered social relations. For supporters
of identity politics (despite claiming otherwise), womanhood, a form of
appearance within society, is reduced to a natural, static "identity."
[[Social relations]{.mark} such as "womanhood," or simply gender,
[become static]{.mark} objects, or "[institutions]{.mark}."]{.underline}
Society is therefore organized into individuals, or sociological groups
with natural characteristics. Therefore, the only possibility for
struggle under identity politics is based on equal distribution or
individualism (I will discuss this further below). This is a bourgeois
ideology in that it replicates the alienated individual invented and
defended by bourgeois theorists and scientists (and materially enforced)
since capitalism's birth. [Furthermore, this [individualism is
characteristic of the current]{.mark}]{.underline} social
[[moment]{.underline}]{.mark}. As left communist theorist Loren Goldner
has theorized, capitalism has been in perpetual crisis for the last 40
years, which has been absorbed in appearance through neoliberal
strategies (among others). Over time, capital is forced to invest in
machines over workers in order to keep up with the competitive
production process. As a result, workers are expelled from the
production process. We can see this most clearly in a place like
Detroit, where automation combined with deindustrialization left
hundreds of thousands jobless. The effects of this contradiction of
capitalism is that [[workers are forced into precarious working
situations]{.underline}]{.mark}, jumping from gig to gig in order to
make enough money to reproduce themselves. [[Goldner refers to
this]{.mark} condition [as the "atomized]{.mark} individual
[worker."]{.mark}]{.underline} As Goldner has written elsewhere,
[[this]{.mark} increased individualism [leads to a politics of
difference, where]{.mark}]{.underline} women, queers,
[[people]{.underline}]{.mark} of color, etc., [[have nothing in
common]{.underline}]{.mark} with one another. Intersectionality
theorists correctly identified and critiqued this problem with identity
politics. For example, bell hooks, in a polemic against liberal feminist
Betty Friedan, writes, "Friedan was a principal shaper of contemporary
feminist thought. Significantly, the one-dimensional perspective on
women's reality presented in her book became a marked feature of the
contemporary feminist movement. Like Friedan before them, white women
who dominate feminist discourse today rarely question whether or not
their perspective on women's reality is true to the lived experiences of
women as a collective group. Nor are they aware of the extent to which
their perspectives reflect race and class biases..." (3). [[hooks is
correct]{.mark} to say [that basing]{.mark} an entire [politics on
one]{.mark} particular [experience]{.mark},]{.underline} or a set of
particular differences, under capitalism [[is problematic]{.underline}.
[However, intersectionality]{.underline}]{.mark} [theory [replicates
this]{.mark} problem [by simply adding]{.mark} particular
[moments]{.mark}]{.underline}, or determinant points; hooks goes on to
argue for race and class inclusion in a feminist analysis. [Similarly,
[theories of an "interlocking matrix]{.mark} of oppressions," [simply
create a list of naturalized identities, abstracted from]{.mark} their
[material and historical]{.mark}]{.underline} context. This
[[methodology]{.underline}]{.mark} is just as ahistorical and antisocial
as Betty Friedan's. Again, [[patriarchy and white supremacy are
not]{.mark} objects or ["institutions"]{.mark} that exist [throughout
history; they are]{.mark} particular [expressions of our]{.mark}
labor]{.underline}, our life-activity, that are [conditioned
by]{.underline} (and in turn, condition) [our [mode of
production]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Capital, Marx describes labor as the
"metabolism" between humans and the external world; patriarchy and white
supremacy, as products of our labor, are also the conditions in which we
labor. We are constantly interacting with the world, changing the world
and changing ourselves through our "metabolic" labor. So patriarchy and
white supremacy, like all social relations of labor, change and
transform. Patriarchy under capitalism takes a specific form that is
different from gendered relations under feudalism, or tribalism, etc.
There will be overlap and similarities in how patriarchy is expressed
under different modes of production. After all, the objective conditions
of feudalism laid the foundation for early capitalism, which laid the
foundation for industrial capitalism, etc. However, this [similarity and
overlap does not mean that particular, patriarchal relations transcend
the mode of production.]{.underline} For example, under both feudalism
and capitalism there are gendered relations within a nuclear family,
though these relations took very different forms particular to the mode
of production. As Silvia Federici describes, within the feudal family
there was little differentiation between men and women. She writes,
"since work on the servile farm was organized on a subsistence basis,
the sexual division of labor in it was less pronounced and less
discriminating than the capitalist farm. ... Women worked in the fields,
in addition to raising children, cooking, washing, spinning, and keeping
an herb garden; their domestic activities were not devalued and did not
involve different social relations from those of men, as they would
later, in a money-economy, when housework would cease to be viewed as
real work" (25). A historical understanding of patriarchy needs to
understand patriarchy from within a set of social relations based on the
form of labor. In other words, we cannot understand the form of
appearance, "womanhood," apart from the essence, a universal human. A
Marxist Conception of Feminism. At this point, I should make myself very
clear and state that the limitations of identity politics and
intersectionality theory are a product of their time. There was no
revolution in the US in 1968. [The advances of [Black Power, women's
liberation, gay liberation, and the movements themselves, have been
absorbed]{.mark} into capital.]{.underline} Since the 1970s, academia
has had a stronghold on theory**.** [[A nonexistent class struggle
leaves a vacuum]{.mark} of theoretical production and academic
intellectuals have had nothing to draw on except for the identity
politics of the past. [A new politics that corresponds to a new form of
struggle is desperately needed;]{.mark} however, [the Marxist method can
provide some insight]{.mark} into the creation of a politics that
overcomes the limitations of identity politics. Marx offers a method
that places the particular in conversation with the
totality]{.underline} of social relations; the appearance connected to
the essence. Consider his use of the concept of "moments." Marx uses
this concept in "The German Ideology" to describe the development of
human history. He describes the following three moments as the "primary
social relations, or the basic aspects of human activity:" (1) the
production of means to satisfy needs, (2) the development of new needs,
and (3) reproduction of new people and therefore new needs and new means
to satisfy new needs. What is key about this idea is that Marx
distinguishes between a "moment" and a "stage." He writes, "These three
aspects of social activity are not of course to be taken as three
different stages, but just as three aspects, or, to make it clear to the
Germans, three 'moments,' which have existed simultaneously since the
dawn of history and the first men, and which still assert themselves in
history today" (48). The particulars of this specific argument are not
relevant; [[what is key is Marx's use of "moments" juxtaposed to
"stages." Marx makes this]{.mark} distinction [to distinguish himself
from a kind of determinism that sees]{.mark} the development of [history
in a static, linear fashion]{.mark}, versus a fluid and dialectical
historical development]{.underline}. Throughout many of Marx's writings,
he refers back to this term, "moments," to describe particular social
relations in history, or, more precisely, particular expressions of
labor. "Moments" also helps fill out Marx's idea of fluid modes of
production. As noted earlier, for Marx, there is no pure feudalism or
pure capitalism; all relations of production move and must be understood
historically. This concept is useful for understanding our various
alienated existences under capitalism. For example, in the Grundrisse,
Marx writes, "When we consider bourgeois society in the long view and as
a whole, then the final result of the process of social production
always appears as the society itself, i.e. the human being itself in its
social relations. Everything that has a fixed form, such as a product
etc., appears as merely a moment, a vanishing moment, in this movement.
The direct individuals, but individuals in a mutual relationship, which
they equally reproduce and produce anew. The constant process of their
own movement, in which they renew themselves even as they renew the
world of wealth they create" (712). To be a "woman" under capitalism
means something very specific; it is even more specific for women in the
US in 2013; it is even more specific for black lesbians in the US in
2013; it is even more specific for individual women. But, in a universal
sense, to be a "woman" means to produce and reproduce a set of social
relations through our labor, or self-activity. [[Taking a cue from
Fanon, our method must argue: I am a woman and a human. We must
recognize the particular in conversation with the totality;]{.mark} we
must consider a moment, or a single expression of labor, in relationship
to labor itself. It is important to note that [identity politics and
intersectionality]{.mark} theorists [are not wrong but]{.mark} they are
[incomplete]{.mark}. Patriarchal and racialized social relations are
material, concrete and real. So are the contradictions between the
particular and universal]{.underline}, and the appearance and essence.
The solution must build upon these contradictions and push on them.
Again, borrowing from Fanon, we can say "I am a woman and a human," or
"I am a black person and a person." The key is to emphasize both sides
of the contradiction. Embracing womanhood, organizing on the basis of
blackness, and building a specifically queer politics is an essential
aspect of our liberation. It is the material starting point of struggle.
As noted earlier, Frantz Fanon describes this movement in "The Lived
Experience of the Black Man" chapter of Black Skin, White Masks.
However, at the end of the chapter, Fanon leaves the contradiction
unresolved and leaves us searching for something more, stating, "Without
a black past, without a black future, it was impossible for me to live
my blackness. Not yet white, no longer completely black, I was damned"
(117), and, "When I opened my eyes yesterday I saw the sky in total
revulsion. I tried to get up but the eviscerated silence surged toward
me with paralyzed wings. Not responsible for my acts, at the crossroads
between Nothingness and infinity, I began to weep" (119). Fanon points
to the contradiction between the particular form of appearance
(blackness) and the essence, the universal (humanness). In the
conclusion, as noted earlier, Fanon resolves this contradiction, arguing
for further movement toward the universal, the total abolition of race.
He writes, "In no way does my basic vocation have to be drawn from the
past of peoples of color. In no way do I have to dedicate myself to
reviving a black civilization unjustly ignored. I will not make myself
the man of any past. I do not want to sing the past to the detriment of
my present and my future" (201). For Fanon then, and for Marx, the
struggle for liberation must include both the particular and the
universal, both the appearance and essence. We must build upon and push
on both sides of these contradictions. Some Practical Consequences.
Since identity politics, and therefore intersectionality theory, are a
bourgeois politics, the possibilities for struggle are also bourgeois.
Identity politics reproduces the appearance of an alienated individual
under capitalism and so struggle takes the form of equality among groups
at best, or individualized forms of struggle at worse. On the one hand,
abstract "sociological" groups or individuals struggle for an equal
voice, equal "representation," or equal resources. [[Many have
experienced this in]{.mark} organizing [spaces where someone
argues]{.mark} that [there are not enough women of color,]{.mark}
disabled individuals]{.underline}, trans\*folks, [etc., present for a
campaign [to move forward]{.mark}.]{.underline} A contemporary example
of this is the critique of Slut Walk for being too white and therefore a
white supremacist or socially invalid movement. [[Another example
is]{.mark}]{.underline} groups and [[individuals who argue that all
movements should be completely subordinate to queer]{.mark} people of
color [leadership, regardless of how reactionary]{.mark} their politics
are.]{.underline} Again, while intersectionality theorists have rightly
identified an objective problem, these divisions and antagonisms within
the class must be address materially through struggle. Simply reducing
this struggle to mere quantity, equality of distribution, or
"representation," reinforces identity as a static, naturalized category.
On the other hand, identity politics can take the form of individualized
struggles against heteropatriarchy, racism, etc., within the class.
According to Barbara Smith, a majority of Combahee River Collective's
work was around teaching white women to stop being racist by holding
anti-racism workshops (95). Today, we might see groups whose only form
of struggle is to identify and smash gendered, machismo,
male-chauvinist, misogynist, and patriarchal elements within the left.
[Another example is Tumblr users' constant reminder to "check your
privilege." Again, [it is important to address]{.mark} and correct
[these elements; however, contradictions]{.mark} and antagonisms [within
the class cannot be overcome in isolation, and individual expressions of
patriarchy are impossible to overcome without a broader struggle for the
emancipation of our labor. We will never free ourselves]{.mark} of
machismo within the movement [without abolishing]{.mark}]{.underline}
gender itself, and therefore [[alienated labor
itself]{.mark}.]{.underline} A truly revolutionary feminist struggle
will collectively take up issues that put the particular and the form of
appearance in conversation with the universal and the essence.
[Elsewhere, [I have offered]{.mark} the following as [examples]{.mark}
of areas [that]{.mark} would [do that work:]{.mark}]{.underline}
Grassroots clinic defense takeovers and/or nonprofit worker committees
that build solidarity across worker-"client" lines. [Neighborhood
[groups]{.mark} engaged [in tenant struggles with the capacity to deal
directly with violence]{.mark}]{.underline} against women in the
community. [[Parent, teacher, and student alliances]{.mark} that
struggle [against]{.mark}]{.underline} school closures/[[privatization
and for transforming schools to]{.mark} more accurately [reflect]{.mark}
the [needs]{.mark} of children and parents, for example on-site
childcare]{.underline}, directly democratic classrooms and districts,
smaller class sizes, etc. [[Sex worker collectives]{.mark}]{.underline}
that protect women from abusive Johns and other community members, and
build democratically women- and queer-run brothels with safe working
conditions. [[Workplace organizations in feminized
workplaces]{.underline}]{.mark} like nonprofits, the service industry,
pink collar manufacturing, etc., or worker centers that specialize in
feminized workplaces and take up issues and challenges specific to
women. [[There are many]{.mark}, many others that [I cannot
theorize]{.mark}.]{.underline} As noted, [[we cannot project the]{.mark}
forms of [struggle]{.mark}]{.underline} and their corresponding theories
[[without the]{.mark} collective and [mass activity of the class, but it
is our job as revolutionaries to provide tools that help]{.mark}
overthrow the present state of affairs. [To do so, we must return to
Marx and the historical materialist method]{.mark}]{.underline}. We can
no longer rely on the ahistorical, bourgeois theories of the past to
clarify the tasks of today. [For feminists, this means struggling as
women but also as humans]{.underline}.

IV\. Moving Forward

We have identified the current regime of anti-oppression politics as
inadequate in providing a way forward in the task of developing a
revolutionary movement capable of meaningfully challenging systems of
oppression and exploitation. Not only are these politics inadequate, but
ultimately regressive and counter productive. [[Attempts to address the
inadequacies of anti-oppression are often met with accusations of class
reductionism]{.underline}]{.mark}. While we acknowledge that class
reductionism exists as an incorrect political orientation, [the
accusation of such can be used [as a
straw\[person\]]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~man~~ [[attack]{.mark} on those
who transgress the dominant discourse within]{.underline}
anarchist/[radical circles]{.underline}.

Reducing the Class

[As an actual political orientation, [class reductionism can be]{.mark}
largely [described as a]{.mark} tendency on the Left which prioritizes
the economic struggle in the workplace as the primary
terrain]{.underline} of revolutionary or progressive action. Often this
will go further to fetishize a particular segment of workplace struggle,
namely that of blue collar, industrial workers. Whether or not it is
implicitly stated, [the [belief]{.mark} is]{.underline} held [[that the
struggle against other oppressions --- white
supremacy]{.mark},]{.underline} hetero-patriarchy, [[ableism, etc. ---
are]{.mark} incidental to the class struggle,]{.underline} to be engaged
in as secondary, [or]{.underline} that they are simply prejudices
concocted by the ruling class [[to be dealt with \"after the
revolution.\"]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[On the other hand, we have]{.mark} the [proponents]{.mark} of
anti-oppression politics [attempting to amalgamate "class" as another
oppression alongside the rest, which \"intersect\"]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}with one another at various times and places in a person\'s
life. [Here we are presented with the grotesque notion of
\"classism\"---the result of an attempt by anti-oppression theory to
reconcile inadequate politics with the entirety of capitalist social
relations.]{.underline} The School Of the Americas Watch Anti-Oppression
Toolkit section on classism offers a prime example:

The stereotype is that poor and working class people are unintelligent,
inarticulate, and \"overly emotional.\" A good ally (a non-working class
committed supporter) will contradict these messages by soliciting the
knowledge and histories of poor working class people, being a thoughtful
listener, trying to understand what is being said...

Putting aside for a second the conflation of "poor" and "working class"
which indicates this writer\'s lack of insight into the matter they seek
to educate about, there is truth in the descriptions of the
"stereotype".

We are reminded of the 2010 movie, Made in Daginham, where Eddie
O\'Grady attempts to ingratiate himself to his wife by pointing out that
he does not beat her or their children. Frustrated by her husband\'s
lack of consideration of her struggle, Rita replies, "That is as it
should be...You don\'t go on the drink, do ya? You don\'t gamble, you
join in with the kids, you don\'t knock us about. Oh, lucky me. For
Christ\'s sake, Eddie, that\'s as it should be! You try and understand
that. Rights, not privileges. It\'s that easy. It really bloody is."

Similarly, [for all the back-patting going on with regards to "allies"
most of what is advised]{.underline} and done [constitutes nothing more
than a minimal standard of behaviour]{.underline}. We do not feel
respected when someone in a position of power "consults" us before
making a decision regarding our lives, no matter how attentive and
probing they may be. We see this emphasis on listening to rather than
creating-with as uncomradely and tokenizing.

In their essay Insurrections at the Intersections anarchists Jen Rogue
and Abbey Volcano address so-called classism by writing:

Since everyone experiences these identities differently, [many
[theorists]{.mark} writing [on intersectionality have referred to
something called "classism" to complement racism]{.mark} and
sexism]{.underline}. This can lead to the gravely confused notion that
class oppression needs to be rectified by rich people treating poor
people "nicer" while still maintaining class society. [[This]{.mark}
analysis [treats class differences as]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}though they are simply [[cultural]{.underline}]{.mark}
differences. In turn, this leads toward the limited strategy of
"respecting diversity" \[...\] [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} argument
[[precludes a class struggle]{.underline}]{.mark} analysis which views
capitalism and class society as institutions and enemies of freedom.
[[We don't]{.underline}]{.mark} wish to [["get along"]{.mark} under
capitalism [by abolishing]{.mark}]{.underline} snobbery and [[class
elitism]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Both of [these]{.mark} instances of reductionism [point to]{.mark} a
fundamental misunderstanding of class and class struggle, as well as to
[the limits of intersectionality in understanding]{.mark} social
relationships under [capitalism]{.mark}. The class reductionism we
should be critical of is that which attempts to reduce the class to a
mere section of it]{.underline} (whether it is simply the poorest, or
the most blue collar), [and that which attempts to hold up the interests
of that section as that of the entire class]{.underline}. The reality is
that the majority of the planet is working class, and we must recognize
that the material obstacles within our class, and the manner by which
they reproduce themselves must be attacked as a matter of necessity. Not
because we are good allies or because we want to check privileges or
because we want to reduce everything to \"class first!\" but because we
are fucking revolutionaries and we have to.

The (Re)production of Division

If our intention is not strictly limited to maintaining activist
enclaves, we are required to look for the means to understand the
development of identity and division under capitalism. In Caliban and
the Witch, Silvia Federici examines the position of women throughout the
rise of capitalism. With an emphasis on the incredibly violent
subjugation necessary, witch burnings being an especially stark example,
Federici outlines the historical process that fostered the patriarchal
social relationships which uphold, and define capitalism.

This process is one which ran alongside the period of primitive
accumulation in the transition from feudalism to capitalism. [The
[enclosure of the commons]{.mark} by a fledgling bourgeoisie [and the
imposition of private property was the material basis for]{.mark} the
[proletarianization]{.mark} of populations---[without the land]{.mark}
base necessary [for subsistence, peasants became workers who]{.mark}
must [sell]{.mark} their [labour]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}for a
wage in order to survive. [[Primitive accumulation is the subsumption of
life into]{.mark} the rubric of [Capital --- land into property]{.mark},
time into wages, [things into commodities --- and by extension the
transformation of social relationships]{.mark} necessary to maintain and
reproduce these categories. The [subjugation of women]{.mark} to
patriarchal capitalism [was]{.mark} a [crucial]{.mark}
element]{.underline} of this process. [The construction of [the nuclear
family, the assignment of domestic]{.mark} and reproductive [labour as
\"women\'s work\", and the]{.mark} subsequent [devaluation]{.mark} and
erasure [of that labour, were historic tasks achieved through]{.mark}
the development of [capitalism. Attempting to understand patriarchy as
limited to]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}individual
[[attitudes]{.underline}]{.mark} or actions, [or somehow isolated from
capitalism]{.underline} (regardless of patriarchal or gendered divisions
of labour in pre-capitalist history) [[is therefore
impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}. Speaking to the accomplishment of the
implementation of these new social relationships, Federici writes:

... in the new organization of work every woman (other than those
privatized by bourgeois men) became a communal good, for once women\'s
activities were defined as non-work, women\'s labor began to appear as a
natural resource, available to all, no less than the air we breathe or
the water we drink.

[[The social, economic, and political position of women was]{.mark} thus
[defined under cap]{.mark}italism. This new reality meant that the class
struggle]{.underline}, that is the struggle for the emancipation of the
working class, [takes on a particular character whether or not this is
recognized]{.underline} by its would-be partisans. Federici further
explains:

[With]{.underline} their expulsion from the crafts and the [devaluation
of reproductive labor, a new patriarchal order was constructed, reducing
women to a double dependence: on employers and on men]{.underline}.

This "double dependence" thus implies that the oppression of women under
capitalism is not something that is incidental, nor something that can
be addressed in isolation. As having particular features and the product
of (ongoing) historic development, [[attacking patriarchy demands that
we attack the conditions which allow the]{.mark} perpetuation of the
[social relationships]{.mark} by which it is constituted]{.underline}.
As class struggle anarchists then we identify the class struggle as one
against this \"double dependence\" as we struggle against the conditions
which are necessary for capitalism to reproduce itself.

Struggling at the Barricades, Struggling at Home

In 2006, the Mexican state of Oaxaca became engulfed in a popular
uprising that lasted several months. What began as an annual teachers
strike developed into a popular conflict. Barucha Calamity Peller\'s
Women in Uprising: The Oaxaca Commune, the State, and Reproductive
Labour looks at the revolt and the particular role women played. The
essay shows us both what the disruption of the reproduction of
patriarchal social relations can look like and how the reinforcement of
those relations from within the movement ultimately contributed to its
limitation and defeat.

On April 1st, 2006, a march of the Cacerolas (later imitated in Quebec
and across Canada) consisting of over ten thousand women, initiated the
takeover of TV station Canal Neuve. Several hundred women from the march
occupied the building, which was repurposed as a communication hub and
resource to the ongoing struggle. Peller writes:

Besides transmitting, producing daily programming, and holding
workshops, long hours were spent during nightly patrols of the
transmitter and defensive barricades in which the women of Canal Nueve
spoke to each other while huddled around small fires drinking coffee to
stay awake. The dialogue and solidarity that emerged between the women
was perhaps one of the most potent results of the takeover. What was
before "private" and "personal" became a site for resistance. It was
during these conversations that women for the first time experienced a
space not dominated by men, in the absence of the market, in which they
could organize freely and relate experiences, and talk to other women.
This is where the idea of women's autonomy emerged in Oaxaca, and it was
to this formation of women, where there was no exploitation of their
labor, no dominance of the market or the family, that the women would
refer throughout the struggle.

[[What we find important]{.mark} here [is the implication that]{.mark}
the creation of new, anti-capitalist, [anti-patriarchal relations
requires the creation of]{.mark} the [material basis]{.mark} to do
so]{.underline}. The creation of such a basis requires the negation and
disruption of the conditions that produce the old ways of interacting.
Here, the occupation of the Canal Neuve could be understood as what a
revolutionary women\'s movement in embryo might look like---where the
conditions were created for the creation of a new subjectivity and the
destruction of the former identity.

In the case of Oaxaca, patriarchy still persisted within the movement.
Women who attempted to challenge traditional gender roles were subjected
to domestic abuse and/or forced to continue to take on the full burden
of reproductive labour.

[Rather than rely on limited class reductionist understandings, either
limiting itself to the factory floor or sociological definitions of
\"proles,\" [we must strive for a class struggle which directs us
towards the abolition of the divisions]{.mark} within our class that are
[necessary to uphold cap]{.mark}italism]{.underline}. We find the
example of the Oaxaca uprising useful insofar as it provides us with a
glimpse of both the undoing of oppressive social relationships, and the
defense of those relationships in a period of intensified struggle.

While this section has focused primarily on gendered division and
oppression under capitalism, [our intention is to emphasize that these
categories and identities are historically constructed, and have a
material basis to their continued reproduction]{.underline}. We see the
process of their destruction as one that is necessarily part of the
class struggle. To paraphrase Marx, this is the process of moving
towards a class that is conscious of itself, and able to act in its own
interest---a class for itself.

V. Conclusion

It is our belief that the ways in which humans are exploited, assaulted,
pitted against one another, and robbed of individual and collective
agency must (and furthermore, can) be overcome and replaced with a
liberatory existence. While some see anti-oppression politics as
contributing to this endeavour, we see these politics as a substantial
hindrance to revolutionary organizing. [[We]{.mark} would like to
[challenge our comrades]{.mark} and fellow travellers [to do better than
this]{.mark} half-hearted liberal [project that facilitates the
reduction of complex]{.mark} social and economic [problems to
interpersonal dynamics and]{.mark} individual [privileges. Our struggle
is collective, and so too must be our]{.mark} tools and
[analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Different starting point -- they say look to experience, we say look to WHY reality is experienced certain ways -- our method is better because it's the only way to move beyond immediate experience

**Panton 4** \[Margaret, former Prof @ St John's College, Hertford
College, "The Politics of Experience: Second-Wave Feminism and the
Unmediated Society", Political Studies Association Conference, 5-8 April
2004, University of Lincoln\]

According to the British socialist feminist Sheila Rowbotham, writing in
1969, the chief limitation of Marxism is its lack of emphasis upon the
interior or experiential level of social reality: 'Unless the internal
process of subjugation is understood, unless the language of silence is
experienced from inside and translated into the language of the
oppressed community themselves, male hegemony will remain. Without such
a translation, Marxism will not be really meaningful'.68 Yet Marxist
social theory and methodology stands in direct contrast to that of
second-wave feminism: Feminism starts with [the immediate, particular
experience of women and develops a general explanation of society
('patriarchy') from this basis]{.underline}.
[[Marxism]{.underline}]{.mark}, in contrast, [starts with the formation
of society]{.underline} in general [and [aims to explain how
society]{.mark} as a whole [is organised. It]{.mark} then [situates
experience in this context]{.mark}]{.underline}.69 Feminism cannot
incorporate Marxism, and nor can Marxism incorporate feminism.70 The
distinction summarised in this paragraph is developed in more detail in
the remainder of this section. The key difference between Marxism and
feminism is as follows. [[Where feminism begins with immediate
experience, Marxist theory aims towards a theory of the
underlying]{.mark} and determinate [dynamic of society
itself]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and its capacity to
explain]{.underline}]{.mark} particular experiences [[is dependent upon
deriving those experiences from a broader social analysis. The starting
point]{.mark} for Marxism [is not]{.mark}]{.underline} the content of
[[experience]{.underline}, [but the question of **why social reality is
experienced**]{.underline}]{.mark} or perceived [[in a particular
way]{.mark} at a particular time: **[it does not assume the confluence
of immediate experience with social reality]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Experience is not false, but it is limited]{.mark} by its very
immediacy; [**particular experience** cannot be explained in terms of
itself, but only in terms of a **broader social
theory**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Marxism seeks to be a totalising
theory, where feminism implies a rejection of any explanation that seeks
to explain society in its totality precisely because a totalising
explanation cannot at the same time be representative of the diversity
of immediate experiences.

### impact -- patriarchy

#### Capitalism is the root cause of patriarchy

**Cloud 3** \[Dana, "Marxism and Oppression", Talk for Regional
Socialist Conference, Aoril 19, 2003 p. online\]

In order to challenge oppression, it is important to know where it comes
from. Historians, archaeologists, and anthropologists tell us that [[in
pre-class societies]{.mark} such as hunter-gatherer societies, [racism
and sexism were unheard of.]{.mark}]{.underline} Because homosexuality
was not an identifiable category of such societies, discrimination on
that basis did not occur either. In fact, it is clear that [racism,
sexism, and homophobia have arisen in particular kinds of societies,
namely class societies. [Women's oppression originated in the first
class societies, w]{.mark}hile racism came into prominence in the early
periods of capitalism when colonialism and slavery drove the economic
system.]{.underline} The [prohibition against gays and lesbians is a
relatively modern phenomenon. But what all forms of oppression have in
common is that they did not always exist and are not endemic to human
nature. They were created in the interest of ruling classes in society
and continue to benefit the people at the top of society, while dividing
and conquering the rest of us so as to weaken the common fight against
the oppressors.]{.underline} The work of Marx's collaborator Friederich
Engels onThe Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State in
some respects reflects the Victorian times in which in was written.
Engels moralizes about women's sexuality and doesn't even include gay
and lesbian liberation in his discussion of the oppressive family.
However, anthropologists like the feminist Rayna Reiter have confirmed
his most important and central argument that it was in the first settled
agricultural societies that women became an oppressed class. In
societies where for the first time people could accumulate a surplus of
food and other resources, it was possible for some people to hoard
wealth and control its distribution. [The first [governments or state
structures formed to legitimate an emerging ruling class. As settled
communities grew in size a]{.mark}nd became more complex social
organizations, and, most importantly, [as the surplus grew, the
distribution of wealth became unequal---]{.mark}and a small number of
men rose above the rest of the population in wealth and power. In the
previous hunter-gatherer societies, there had been a sexual division of
labor, but one without a hierarchy of value.]{.underline} There was no
strict demarcation between the reproductive and productive spheres. All
of that changed with the development of private property in more settled
communities. [[The earlier division of labor in which men did the
heavier work]{.mark}, hunting, and animal agriculture, [became a system
of differential control over resource distribution. The new system
required more field workers and sought to maximize women's reproductive
potential]{.mark}. Production shifted away from the household over time
[and women became associated with the reproductive role]{.mark}, losing
control over the production and distribution of the necessities of life.
It was not a matter of male sexism, but of economic priorities of a
developing class system.]{.underline} This is why Engels identifies
women's oppression as the first form of systematic class oppression in
the world. Marxists since Engels have not dismissed the oppression of
women as secondary to other kinds of oppression and exploitation. To the
contrary, women's oppression has a primary place in Marxist analysis and
is a key issue that socialists organize around today. From this history
we know that sexism did not always exist, and that [[men do not have an
inherent interest in oppressing women]{.mark} as domestic servants or
sexual slaves.]{.underline} Instead, [[women's oppression always has
served a class hierarchy in society]{.underline}]{.mark}. In our society
divided by sexism, [[ideas about women's nature]{.mark} as domestic
caretakers or irrational sexual beings [justify paying women lower wages
compared to men,]{.mark} so that employers can pit workers against one
another in competition for the same work]{.underline}. Most women have
always had to work outside the home to support their families. Today,
[women around the world are exploited in sweatshops where their status
as women allows bosses to pay them very little]{.underline}, driving
down the wages of both men and women. At the same time, [[capitalist
society relies on ideas about women to justify not providing very much
in the way of social services]{.mark} t]{.underline}hat would help
provide health care, family leave, unemployment insurance, access to
primary and higher education, and so forth---all [because these things
are supposed to happen in the private family, where women are
responsible.]{.underline} This lack of social support results in a lower
quality of life for many men as well as women. [Finally, [contemporary
ideologies that pit men against women encourage us to fight each other
rather than organizing together.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Openness to flux and constant becoming destroys the foundations for political institutions necessary to sustain radical democratic life\-\--some universal, "fixed" guarantees of equality are crucial to politics 

Joseph **Schwartz 8**, Professor of Political Science at Temple
University, The Future of Democratic Equality, 56-61

Butler, Brown, and Connolly reject the essentialism of "narrow" identity
politics as an inverted "ressentiment" of the Enlightenment desire for a
universal, homogenized identity. They judge identity politics to be a
politics of "wounding, resentment, and victimization" that only can
yield bad-faith moralization Wendy Brown takes to task identity politics
for "essentializing" conceptions of group identity. For example, she
critiques the work of Catherine MacKinnon as epitomizing "identity"
political theory, accusing MacKinnon of denying women agency by
depicting them purely as victims.38 Brown also remains wary of the
patriarchal, conformist nature of traditional left conceptions of
solidarity and citizenship. Brown's implicit concept of radical
democratic citizenship rests upon the recognition that political
identity is continually in flux and is socially constituted through
"agonal" political struggle. Brown celebrates an Arendtian conception of
a polity in which both shared and particular identities are continually
open to reconstruction. In this "left Nietzschean" view of an
"everyperson's" will to power, there can be no cultural certainties or
political givens, as such "givens" would repress difference and
fluidity.39 But, [[if the human condition is]{.underline}]{.mark} a
world of [permanent [flux]{.mark}, then we must postulate a human
capability of living with constant insecurity, for in this world there
can be no stable political institutions or political
identitie]{.underline}s.40 [[An ability to calculate the]{.mark}
probabilities of [political actions or public policies would
disappear]{.mark} in this world of infinite liminality.]{.underline} [By
[assuming that the pre-eminent]{.mark} democratic [value is]{.mark} that
of [leaving all issues as permanently open to question,
post-structuralist]{.mark} "democratic [theory" **eschews the**
]{.mark}**theoretical and political [struggle over what established
institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} and consensual values [**[are needed
to underpin a democratic society]{.underline}**.]{.mark}¶
Post-structuralist analysis has contributed to a healthy suspicion of
narrow and "essentializing" identity politics. But a self-identified
feminist, African- American, or lesbian activist is likely to value the
shared historical narratives that partly constitute such group
identities. [[Of course, if one is a democrat]{.mark} and a pluralist,
[one would reject]{.mark} the [oppressive homogenization]{.mark}
and]{.underline} potentially [authoritarian]{.underline} aspects of
ethnic or racial chauvinism and of "essentializing" types of identity
[politics]{.underline}. [The democratic political home should be open,
fluid, and self-reflective; [but if]{.mark}]{.underline} [[participation
is to be open]{.underline}]{.mark} to all, then such a
[[society]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[needs]{.underline}]{.mark} to
reproduce [[a]{.mark} shared democratic culture and the [institutional
guarantee of]{.mark} democratic [rights]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is,
contrary to post-structuralist analysis, [[not all issues can be open
to]{.mark} "agonal [struggle]{.mark}]{.underline}" in a democratic
society. The traditional radical democratic critique of democratic
capitalism remains valid; [[the]{.mark} equal [worth of the individual
is devalued by]{.mark} rampant [social inequality]{.mark} within and
between groups. Thus, [a radical democrat]{.mark}, whether
post-structuralist or not, [must not only be committed to institutional
protections of political and civil rights, but also to social
rights]{.mark}---the equal access to the basic goods of citizenship
(education, **health care**, housing, child care). Of
course]{.underline}, the precise nature and extent of these [rights will
be politically contested and constructed. But a democratic society
cannot leave as totally "open" the minimal institutional basis of
democracy]{.underline}--- a democratic society cannot be agnostic as to
the value of freedom of speech, association, and universal suffrage.¶
Social movements fighting for an expansion of civil, political, and
social rights, rarely, if ever, rest their arguments on appeals to
epistemological truths--- whether "foundational" or "anti-foundational."
To remain democratic, their policy goals cannot be so specific that they
preclude political argument about both their worth and how best to
institutionalize them. If social movements in a 58 democratic society
deemed that every policy defeat meant a betrayal of basic democratic
principles, there would be no give-and-take or winners and losers within
democratic politics. But if a government were to abolish freedom of
speech and competitive elections, or deny a social group basic rights,
it would be reasonable for an observer to judge that democratic
principles had been violated. [[Democratic political
movements]{.underline}]{.mark} and coalitions [[struggle to construct
**shared meanings** about those political]{.underline}]{.mark}, civil,
and social [[rights that should be guaranteed to all]{.mark}
citizens]{.underline}---and they often work to expand the types of
persons to be recognized as citizens (such as excluded immigrants).
**[[Such arguments are inevitably grounded in normative arguments that
go beyond]{.mark} merely [asserting]{.mark} the import of ["flux,"
"difference]{.mark},"]{.underline}** and "anti-essentialism." The civil
rights movement did not demand equal rights for all solely as an
"agonal" assertion of the will of the excluded; they desired to gain for
persons of color an established set of civil and political rights that
had been granted to some citizens and denied to others. The movement
correctly assumed that the exclusion of citizens from full political and
civil rights violated the basic norms of a democratic society. Thus,
[postmodern epistemological commitments to "flux" and "openness"
cannot]{.underline} in-and-of-themselves [sustain the "fixed" moral
positions needed to sustain a radical democracy.¶]{.underline}
Post-structuralist theorists openly proclaim their hostility to all
philosophical "meta-narratives." They reject comprehensive conceptions
of how society operates and the type of society that would best
instantiate human freedom. But
[[post-structuralists]{.underline}]{.mark} go beyond rejecting
"meta-narratives"; they insist that only an "anti-foundational"
epistemology can ground a politics of emancipation. For Butler, Brown,
and Connolly, not only do "meta-discourses" invariably fail in their
efforts to ground moral positions in a theory of human nature or human
reason. They also assert that an agonal politics of democratic "we"
formation can alone sustain democratic society. This agonal [[politics,
they claim, can only be sustained by]{.mark} a recognition
of]{.underline} the inconstant signification of discourse and [the
ineluctable [flux]{.mark} of]{.underline} personal and group
[identity]{.underline}.41 Rejecting the authoritarian, celebration of
the "ubermensch" by Nietzsche, they offer a post-Nietzschean, "amoral"
conception of democracy as an open-ended project of defining a self and
community that is constantly open to the desires of "others." These
theorists constantly reiterate the definitiveness (dare we say
"foundational truth") of this grounding of democracy, **[[despite the
historical reality that social movements]{.mark} often [contest dominant
narratives in the name of a stable alternative narrative of a
democratic]{.mark} and pluralist [community]{.mark}.]{.underline}**¶ One
might well contend that the [post-structuralist political stance is
guilty of a new meta-narrative of "bad faith," that of
"anti-foundationalism."]{.underline} According to this anti-foundational
politics, a true democrat must reject any and all a priori truths
allegedly grounded upon the nature of human reason or human nature. A
committed democrat may well be skeptical of such neo-Kantian or
neo-Hegelian conceptions of freedom; but, many committed democrats
justify their moral commitments using these philosophical methods. A
democrat might also reject (or accept) the arguments of a Jurgen
Habermas or Hans Georg Gadamer that the structure of human linguistic
communication contains within it the potential for a society based on
reasoned argument rather than manipulation and domination. But there are
numerous other philosophically "pragmatic" ways to justify democracy,
even utilitarian ones. Political democrats may well disagree about the
best philosophical defense of democracy. But, invariably, "practicing
democrats" will defend the belief (however philosophically "proved" or
"justified") that democratic regimes best fulfill the moral commitment
to the equal worth of persons and to the equal potential of human beings
to freely develop and pursue their life plans.¶ To contend that only an
anti-foundationalist, anti-realist epistemology can sustain democracy is
to argue precisely for a foundational metaphysical grounding for the
democratic project. It is to contend that one's epistemology determines
one's politics. Hence, [Brown and Butler]{.underline} both
[spoke]{.underline} at a spring 1998 academic conference at the
University [of]{.underline} California at Santa Cruz where some
attributed "reactionary" and "left cultural conservatism" to belief in
"[reactionary" "foundationalist humanism]{.underline}."42
**[Post-structuralism cannot escape its own essentialist conception of
identity.]{.underline}** For example, [Butler]{.underline} contends in
Feminist Contentions that [democratic feminists must embrace the
post-structuralist "nondefinability of woman"]{.underline} as best
suited to open democratic constitution of what it is to be a "woman."43
[But this is itself a "closed" position and runs counter to the
practices of many democratic feminist activists who have tried to
develop a pluralist, yet collective identity around the shared
experiences of being a woman in a patriarchal society]{.underline} (of
course, realizing that working-class women and women of color experience
patriarchy in some ways that are distinct from the patriarchy
experienced by middle-class white women).¶ [One query that
post-structuralist theorists might ask themselves: **[has there ever
existed a]{.mark} mass [social movement that defined its primary
"ethical" values as being those of "instability and
flux"?]{.mark}**]{.underline} Certainly many sexual politics activists
are cognizant of the fluid nature of sexuality and sexual and gender
identity. But only a small (disproportionately university educated)
segment of the women's and gay and lesbian movement would subscribe to
(or even be aware of) the core principles of post-structuralist
"anti-essentialist epistemology." Nor would they be agnostic as to
whether the state should protect their rights to express their
sexuality. [Post-structuralist theorists cannot avoid justificatory
arguments for why some identities should be considered open and
democratic and others exclusionary and anti-democratic]{.underline}.
That is, how could post-structuralist political theorists argue that
Nazi or Klan "ethics" are antithetical to a democratic society---and
that a democratic society can rightfully ban certain forms of "agonal"
(e.g. harassing forms of behavior against minorities) struggle on the
part of such anti-democratic groups.

#### The aff's focus on becoming forever suspends political engagement in favor of self-therapy\-\--accepting some axioms of commonality are necessary to achieve emancipation 

Chamsy **Ojeili 3**, Senior Lecturer School of Social and Cultural
Studies, Victoria University of Wellington, Post-modernism, the Return
to Ethics, and the Crisis of Socialist Values,
[www.democracynature.org/vol8/ojeili_ethics.htm#\_edn9](http://www.democracynature.org/vol8/ojeili_ethics.htm#_edn9)

Notably, anarchists have often been charged with this failing by Marxian
thinkers.\[157\] Anarchism does include those suspicious of the demands
of association, those who fear the tyranny of the majority and who
emphasise instead the uniqueness and liberty of the individual. Here,
the freedom of the creative individual, unhindered by the limitations of
sociality, is essential. This second strand shows clearly the influence
of liberal ideas. It is also, in its bohemian and nihilistic
incarnation, a child to the malevolent trio of De Sade, Stirner,
Nietzsche, that is, those who reject coercive community mores and who
recoil from herdish, conformist pressures. The free individual must
create his or her own guiding set of values, exploring the hitherto
untapped and perhaps darker aspects of him or herself through an art
which chaffs against the standards of beauty and taste of the ordinary
mortal. Given that freedom cannot endure limitations and that all idols
have been driven from the world and the mind, for these revolutionaries,
"all is permitted".\[158\] This emphasis on individual sovereignty is
clear in Godwin and Stirner,\[159\] but also in Goldman's suspicion of
collective life, in her elevation of the role of heroic individuals in
history, and in the work of situationist Raoul Vaneigem.\[160\] This
accent within non-orthodox socialism has been much criticised. For
instance, Murray Bookchin has contrasted "social" with "lifestyle"
anarchism, rejecting the elevation the self-rule of the individual in
the latter to the highest goal of anarchist thinking.\[161\] One might
[consider]{.underline}, here, [the consequences]{.underline}, in the
case of Emma Goldman, [of the substitution of collective revolutionary
change for]{.underline} boheme and for [an intellectualist contempt for
the]{.underline} [masses]{.underline}. [Goldman]{.underline}
[turned]{.underline} more and [more to purely self-expressive
activity]{.underline} and increasingly appealed to intellectuals and
middle class audiences, who felt amused and flattered by her
individualism and exotic iconoclasm.\[162\] **[[This]{.mark} egoistic
and [personalistic turn ignores the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[essential]{.underline}]{.mark} social [anarchist [aspiration to
freedom, the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[commitment to an end to domination
in society]{.underline}**]{.mark}, the comprehension of the social
premises of the individualist urge itself, and the necessity of moving
beyond a purely negative conception of liberty to a thicker, positive
conception of freedom.\[163\] Perhaps, as Bookchin has rather
trenchantly asserted, [[the]{.mark} [recent individualist]{.mark} and
neo-situationist [concern with
subjectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} expression, [and
desire]{.underline} **[[is]{.mark} all [too much like]{.mark} middle
class [narcissism and the self-centred therapeutics of New Age
culture]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Perhaps also, as Barrot has said, the
kind of revolutionary life advocated by Vaneigem cannot be lived.\[164\]
Further, total freedom for any one individual necessarily means
diminished freedom for others. As La Banquise argue, "Repression and
sublimation prevent people from sliding into a refusal of
otherness".\[165\] For socialists, freedom must be an ineradicably
social as well as an individual matter. [The]{.underline} whole [thrust
of libertarian politics is towards a collective project that
reconstructs]{.underline} those [freedom-limiting structures of economy,
power, and ideology]{.underline}.\[166\] It seems unlikely that such
ambitions could be achieved by those motivated solely by a Sadean
ambition to seek satisfaction of their own improperly understood
desires. On this question, Castoriadis is again useful -- [accenting
autonomy as a property of the collective and of each individual within
society, and rejecting the]{.underline} [opposition between community
and humanity]{.underline}, between the "inner man \[sic\] and the public
man \[sic\]".\[167\] [Castoriadis ridiculed abstract
individualism]{.underline}[: "[We are not]{.underline}]{.mark}
['individuals']{.underline}, **[[freely floating]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[above society]{.underline} and history, [who are **[capable of deciding
sovereignly]{.mark}**]{.underline} and in the absolute about what we
shall do, about how we shall do it, and about the meaning our doing will
have once it is done ... Above all, qua individuals, we choose neither
the questions to which we will have to respond nor the terms in which
they will be posed, nor, especially, the ultimate meaning of our
response, once given".\[168\] [Rejecting the]{.underline} contemporary
[tendency to posit others as limitations on our freedom]{.underline},
Castoriadis argued that [[others were]{.mark} in fact [premises of
liberty, "possibilities of action]{.mark}]{.underline}", [and "sources
of facilitation]{.underline}".\[169\] [[Freedom is]{.mark} the most
vital object of politics]{.underline}, [and this freedom]{.underline} --
[[always a process]{.mark} and never an achieved state]{.underline} --
[is equated with the "effective]{.underline}, humanly [feasible, lucid
and]{.underline} [reflective positing of the rules of individual and
collective activity]{.underline}".\[170\] An autonomous society -- one
without alienation -- explicitly and democratically creates and
recreates the institutions of its own world, formulating and
reformulating its own rules, rather than simply accepting them as given
from above and outside. The resulting institutions, Castoriadis hoped,
would facilitate high levels of responsibility and activity among all
people in respect of all questions about society.\[171\] Castoriadis'
notion of social transformation holds to the goals of integrated human
communities, the unification of people's lives and culture, and the
collective domination of people over their own lives.\[172\] He was also
[committed to the free deployment of the person's creative
forces.]{.underline} Just as Castoriadis enthused over the capacity of
human collectivities for immense works of creativity and
responsibility,\[173\] so he insisted on the radical creativity of the
individual and the importance of individual freedom. Congruent with the
notion of social autonomy, Castoriadis posited the autonomous individual
as, most essentially, one who legislates for and thus regulates him or
herself.\[174\] Turning to psychoanalysis, he designated this autonomy
as the emergence of a more balanced and productive relationship between
the ego and the unconscious. For Castoriadis, **[these goals were not
guaranteed by anything outside of the collective activity of people
towards such goals]{.underline}**, [and he insisted that [individual
autonomy **could only arise "under** ]{.mark}**heavily [instituted
conditions ... through]{.mark} the instauration of [a regime that is
genuinely ... democratic]{.mark}**"]{.underline}.\[175\] **[[Such an
outcome could]{.mark} not [be solved]{.mark} in theory but [only
by]{.mark} a [re-awakening]{.mark} of [politics]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[Only in the clash of opinions -- dependent on a restructured social
formation -- not determined in advance]{.underline} by naturalistic or
religious postulates, [could a true ethics emerge]{.underline}.\[176\]
This, I believe, is the highpoint of libertarian thinking about ethics
and politics. Conclusion I have argued that socialist orthodoxy has been
eclipsed as a programme for the good life. On the one hand, it devolves
into a project of pragmatic expediency bereft of a political and ethical
dimension, where statist administration submerges both individual
freedom and democratic decision-making. On the other hand, as social
democracy the orthodox tradition coalesces into a variety of more or
less straightforward liberalism. Liberalism tends to overstate the
conception of humans as choosers, under-theorising and under-valuing the
necessity of political community and the social dimension of
individuality and the necessity of a positive conception of freedom. The
communitarian critique, however, too readily diminishes the freedoms of
the individual, subordinating people entirely to the horizons of
community life and reducing politics to something like a "general will".
Possessed of both liberal and communitarian features, post-modernism has
been skeptical about the idea of a unitary human essence. It has
jettisoned the notion of humans as unencumbered choosers, and it has
underscored the constructedness of all our values. In so doing,
[post-modernism signals]{.underline} a renewed [interest in
ethics]{.underline}, in questions of responsibility, evaluation, [and
difference]{.underline}, within contemporary social thinking.
Post-modernism offers a valuable critique of the tendency of socialist
orthodoxy to bury the socialist insight as to the sociality and
historicity of values. [Nevertheless]{.underline}, advancing as it does
on orthodox socialism, [post-modernism's]{.underline} radical
constructivism and its [horror at]{.underline} the disasters of
confident and unreflective [modernity can issue in an ironic
hesitancy]{.underline}, [indicated]{.underline} in particular [by an
**[uncritical emphasis on]{.mark} pluralism and
[incommensurability]{.mark} that [threatens to forever suspend
evaluation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[177\] [One signal of this is
the]{.underline} cautious and **[[depoliticised obsession with
Otherness]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and the subject as victim of the
return to ethics]{.underline}.\[178\] Further,
[post-modernism]{.underline} all too often [[withdraws from
universals]{.mark} and emancipation [towards particularist]{.mark} --
either [individualist]{.mark}]{.underline} or community-based --
[[answers to]{.mark} questions of [justice]{.mark}]{.underline} and the
content of the valuable life. In contrast, **[those seeking a radical,
inclusive democracy must remain engaged and universalist in
orientation]{.underline}**. A number of libertarians have not hesitated
in committing themselves, most importantly, to [the
[emancipation]{.mark} of humanity]{.underline} without exception.\[179\]
In fact, **[[politics]{.mark} and ethics [seem unthinkable
without]{.mark} such [universalistic aspirations]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[Post-modernists themselves]{.underline} have often had to [submit to
this truth]{.underline}, [**smuggling into their analyses**
universally-binding ethico-political principles and attempting to
theorise the potential linkages between progressive political
struggles.]{.underline} [However, such [linkages **do not amount to a
coherent** ]{.mark}**anti-systemic [movement that addresses]{.mark} the
power of [state and capital]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In contrast, the
[[universalist commitments]{.mark} of the ethics of
emancipation]{.underline} held to by many libertarians [[accents]{.mark}
both freedom and equality**, and [the establishment of a true political
community]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [against the
dominations]{.underline} and distortions [of state and
capital]{.underline}. [Against the contemporary [obsession
with]{.mark}]{.underline} [[ethics]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[is
so]{.mark} often **[sloganistic,
depoliticised]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} defensive, privatised,
[and trivial]{.underline}, [[we should]{.underline}]{.mark}, with
Castoriadis, [[accent politics as]{.mark} primary and as [the condition
of proper ethical engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}. I have argued that,
in line with Castoriadis' strictures, such a political community and the
aspiration to truly ethical and political deliberation, can only be
attained when socialists free themselves from belief in the possibility
of extra social guarantees "other than the free play of passions and
needs",\[180\] and from the expectation of an end to tensions and
dilemmas around questions of social ordering. On these terms,
libertarian goals are not -- contra liberal strictures -- the negation
of aspirations for freedom and democracy but are rather a collective
pressing of these aspirations to the very far limits of popular
sovereignty. It is for this reason that the stubborn durability of these
goals may, against all expectations, be an auspicious sign for
libertarian utopianism.

### link -- indigenous environment affs

#### The mythological grouping of all indigenous groups with land justifies romantic myths about cultural identities that provoke militarization and scapegoating -- treating the globe as a commons where no identity is entitled to any land ownership is crucial to build the institutions capable of solving both the assault on Native peoples worldwide and global environmental catastrophe

[The]{.underline} second problem is Klein\'s [association of communities
with **indigeneity** and **land**.]{.underline} Klein writes,
\"communities with strong ties to the land have always, and will always,
defend themselves against businesses that threaten their ways of life\"
(309). Here again she [denies]{.underline} **[division]{.underline}**,
[as if **everyone** in a community **agreed** on what constituted a
threat, as if they were all similarly situated against a
threat]{.underline}, [as if they were **never too
deluded**]{.underline}, tired, [or exploited to defend themselves, as if
they could never themselves constitute a threat to
themselves.]{.underline} [Cities, towns, states, and regions make bad
decisions all the time]{.underline}; they stimulate industries that
destroy them. Klein, though, has something else in mind, \"a ferocious
love\" that \"no amount of money can extinguish.\" She associates this
love \"with an identity, a culture, a beloved place that people are
determined to pass on to their grandchildren, and that their ancestors
may have paid for with great sacrifice.\" She continues, \"And [though
this kind of connection to place is surely strongest in Indigenous
communities]{.underline} where the ties to the land go back thousands of
years, it is in fact Blockadia\'s defining feature\" (342).
[Participants]{.underline} in my seminar [found this description
**racist** or **fascist**]{.underline}. Even though this is not Klein\'s
intent, her [rhetoric deploys a **set of myths regarding
nature**]{.underline}, [and some people\'s **relation to nature**, that
make some people closer to nature (and **further from
civilization**)]{.underline} than others. It [also justifies an intense
defense of blood and soil on the part of one group\'s attachment to a
place such that others become foreign]{.underline}, invaders, [rightly
excluded as **threats to our way of life**, our **cultural
identity**.]{.underline} [Given]{.underline} that climate change is
already leading to increased migration and immigration and [that the US
and Europe are already **responding by militarizing
borders**]{.underline}, a [language of **cultural defense**]{.underline}
[and **ties to the land**]{.underline} [is exactly **what we don\'t
need** in a global movement for climate justice.]{.underline} Klein\'s
argument, though, gets worse [as it juxtaposes **indigenous people\'s
love of place** with]{.underline} the \"extreme
**[rootlessness]{.underline}**\" [of the fossil fuel
workforce]{.underline}. These \"[highly mobile]{.underline}\"
pipefitters, [miners, engineers, and]{.underline} big rig [drivers
produce a **culture of transience**]{.underline}, even when they \"may
stay for decades and raise their kids\" in a place. [The language of
**rootless** echoes]{.underline} [with descriptions of cosmopolitan
Jews, intellectuals, and communists. **Some are always foreign elements
threatening our way of life**]{.underline}. **[In
contrast]{.underline}**, [I imagine climate politics as breaking the
link between **place** and **identity**]{.underline}. [To address
climate change, we have to **treat the world itself as a commons** and
**build institutions** adequate to the task of managing it]{.underline}.
I don\'t have a clear idea as to what these institutions would look
like. But **[the idea that no one is entitled to any place seems better
to me as an ethos for a red-green coalition]{.underline}**. **[It
requires us to be accountable to every place]{.underline}**.

### link -- settler colonialism

#### Postcolonial studies divorced from capitalist analysis reinforce the dominant interest that there is no alternative to the present -- the resulting amnesia regarding collective political action imperils revolutionary change 

**Eagleton 3** \[Terry, Distinguished Professor of English Literature at
Lancaster University, *After Theory*, 2003, Basic Books: New York, NY,
p. 5-9\]

[Not all students of culture are blind to the Western narcissism
involved in working on the history of pubic hair while **half the
world's population lacks adequate sanitation and survives on less than
two dollars a day.** Indeed, the most flourishing sector of cultural
studies today]{.underline} [is]{.underline} so-called [**post-colonial
studies**, which]{.underline} [deals with just this dire
condition]{.underline}. Like the discourse of gender and sexuality, [it
has been one of the most precious achievements of cultural
theory]{.underline}. Yet [these ideas have thrived among new generations
who,]{.underline} for no fault of their own, **[can remember little of
world-shaking political importance]{.underline}**. Before the advent of
the so-called war on terrorism, it seemed as though there might be
nothing more momentous for young Europeans to recount to their
grandchildren than the advent of the euro. [Over the]{.underline} dreary
decades of post-1970s conservatism, [the historical sense had grown
**increasingly blunted**]{.underline}, [as it suited those in power that
we should be able to imagine **no alternative to the
present**]{.underline}. [The future would simply be the present
infinitely repeated]{.underline} - or, as the postmodernist remarked,
'the present plus more options'. There are now those who piously insist
on 'historicizing' and who seem to believe that anything that happened
before 1980 is ancient history. [To live in interesting times is
not,]{.underline} to be sure, [an unmixed blessing, It is no particular
consolation to be able to recall the Holocaust, or to have lived through
the Vietnam war]{.underline}. Innocence and amnesia have their
advantages. [There is no point in mourning the blissful days when you
could have your skull fractured by the police every weekend in Hyde
Park.]{.underline} To recall a world-shaking political history is also,
for the political left at least, to recall what is for the most part a
history of defeat. In any case, a new and ominous phase of global
politics has now opened[, which not even the most cloistered of
academics will be able to ignore.]{.underline} Even so, [what has proved
most damaging]{.underline}, at least before the emergence of the
anticapitalist movement, [is the absence of memories of **collective**,
and **effective**, **political action**]{.underline}. [it is this which
has warped so many contemporary cultural ideas out of
shape.]{.underline} [There is a historical vortex at the centre of our
thought which drags it out of true.]{.underline} Much of the world as we
know it, despite its solid, wellupholstered appearance, is of recent
vintage. It was thrown up by the tidal waves of revolutionary
nationalism which swept the globe in the period after the Second World
War, tearing one nation after another from the grip of Western
colonialism. The Allies' struggle in the Second World War was itself a
successful collaborative action on a scale unprecedented in human
history - one which crushed a malevolent fascism at the heart of Europe,
and in doing so laid some of the foundations of the world wc know today.
[Much of the global community we see around us was formed]{.underline},
fairly [recently]{.underline}, [by **collective revolutionary
projects**]{.underline} - projects which were [launched often enough by
the weak and hungry, but which nevertheless proved **successful** in
dislodging their **predatory foreign rulers**]{.underline}. Indeed, the
Western empires which those revolutions dismantled were themselves for
the most part the product of revolutions. [It is just that they were
those most victorious revolutions of all -]{.underline} the ones which
we have forgotten ever took place. [And that usually means the ones
which produced the likes of us. Other people's revolutions are always
more eye-catching than one's own]{.underline}. But [it is one thing to
make a revolution, and another to sustain it.]{.underline} Indeed, for
the most eminent revolutionary leader of the twentieth century, what
brought some revolutions to birth in the first place was also what was
responsible for their ultimate downfall. Vladimir Lenin believed that it
was the very backwardness of Tsarist Russia which had helped to make the
Bolshevik revolution possible. Russia was a nation poor in the kind of
civic institutions which secure the loyalty of citizens to the state,
and thus help to stave off political insurrection. Its power was
centralized rather than diffuse, coercive rather than consensual: it was
concentrated in the state machine, so that to overthrow that was to
seize sovereignty at a stroke, But this very same poverty and
backwardness helped to scupper the revolution once it had been made. You
could not build socialism in an economic backwater, encircled by
stronger, politically hostile powers, among a mass of unskilled,
illiterate workers and peasants without traditions of social
organization and democratic self-government. The attempt to do so called
for the strong-armed measures of Stalinism, which ended up subverting
the very socialism it was trying to construct. 8 THE POLITICS OF AMNESIA
[Something of the same fate afflicted many of those nations who managed
in the twentieth century to free themselves from Western colonial
rule.]{.underline} in a tragic irony, [socialism proved least possible
where it was most necessary]{.underline}. Indeed, post[-colonial theory
first emerged in the wake of the failure of Third World nations to go it
alone.]{.underline} It marked the end of the era of Third World
revolutions, and the first glimmerings of what we now know as
globalization. In the I 9 50s and 60s, a series of liberation movements,
led by the nationalist middle classes, had thrown off their colonial
masters in the name of political sovereignty and economic independence.
[By harnessing the demands of an impoverished people to these goals, the
Third World elites could install themselves in power on the back of
popular discontent. Once]{.underline} [ensconced]{.underline} there,
they would need to engage in an ungainly balancing act between radical
pressures from below and global market forces from outside. Marxism, an
internationalist current to its core, lent its support to these
movements, respecting their demand for political autonomy and seeing in
them a grievous setback to world capitalism. But [many Marxists
harboured few illusions about the aspiring middle-class elites who
spearheaded these nationalist currents. Unlike the more sentimental
brands of post-colonialism]{.underline}, [most **Marxism did not assume
that 'Third World' meant good** **and 'First World' bad.**]{.underline}
[They insisted rather on a class-analysis of colonial and post-colonial
politics themselves]{.underline}. Isolated, [poverty-stricken and poor
in civic, liberal or democratic traditions,]{.underline} [some of these
regimes found themselves taking the Stalinist path into]{.underline}
crippling [isolation]{.underline}. Others had to acknowledge that they
could not go it alone - that political sovereignty had brought with it
no authentic economic self-government, and could never do so in a
West-dominated world. As the world capitalist crisis deepened from the
early 1970s onwards, and as a number of Third World nations sank further
into stagnation and corruption, the aggressive restructurings of a
Western capitalism fallen upon hard times finally put paid to illusions
of national-revolutionary independence. 'Third Worldism' accordingly
gave way to 'post-colonialism'. Edward Said's magisterial Orientalism,
published in 1978, marked this transition in intellectual terms, despite
its author's understandable reservations about much of the post-colonial
theory which was to follow in its wake. The book appeared at the
turning-point of the fortunes of the international left. [Given the
partial failure of national revolution]{.underline} in the so-called
Third World, [post-colonial theory was wary of all talk of
nationhood]{.underline}. Theorists who were either too young or too
obtuse to recall that nationalism had born in its time an astonishingly
effective anti-colonial force could find in it nothing but a benighted
chauvinism or ethnic supremacism. Instead, [much post-colonial thought
focused on the cosmopolitan dimensions of a world in which post-colonial
states were being sucked inexorably into the orbit of global
capital.]{.underline} In doing so, it reflected a genuine reality. But
[in rejecting the idea of nationhood, it also tended to jettison the
notion of class, which had been so closely bound up with the
revolutionary nation]{.underline}. Most of the new theorists were not
only 'post' colonialism, but 'post' the revolutionary impetus which had
given birth to the new nations in the first place. [If those
nation-states had partly failed, unable to get on terms with the
affluent capitalist world, then to look beyond the nation seemed to mean
looking beyond class as well - and this at a time when capitalism was
more powerful and predatory than ever]{.underline}. [It is true that the
revolutionary nationalists had in a sense looked beyond class
themselves. By rallying the national people, they could forge a spurious
unity out of conflicting class interests]{.underline}.

**DiCaglio, 21**---Assistant Professor of English, Texas A&M University
(Joshua, "Learning to Scale," *Scale Theory: A Nondisciplinary Inquiry*,
Introduction, 6-9, dml)

[This]{.underline} book traces out the conceptual, perceptual, and
discursive aspects of scale writ large, including how we find ourselves
with scale as a notion, the conditions under which it operates, and the
difficulties it presents for human knowledge built largely on nonscalar
experience. It [tries]{.underline}, first and foremost, [to highlight
**scale** as a]{.underline} certain [way of **thinking** and
**speaking**]{.underline}, [and to **train** the reader in this way of
thinking]{.underline}. I hope to demonstrate that [the **longer you
dwell** with scale]{.underline}, [the **more fundamental** it
appears]{.underline}.

There are three foundational philosophical concepts that [scale
**indelibly alters**]{.underline}. First, scale deals with [the
**delineation** of objects]{.underline}, [**transforming** one field of
objects into others depending on the **scale of inquiry**]{.underline}.
[Scale suggests that any object appears **different**]{.underline}---[or
**does not even exist at all**]{.underline}---[if you **change the
scale** of perception]{.underline}. As two ecologists note, "[If you
move far enough across scales]{.underline}, [the **dominant processes**
change]{.underline}. [It is **not** just that things get **bigger** or
**smaller**]{.underline}, [but the **phenomena themselves**
change]{.underline}."3 [In a **framework of scale**]{.underline},
[objects are **no longer**]{.underline} clearly separate,
[apparent]{.underline}, and self-contained entities "[in
themselves]{.underline}," [since changes in scale reveal that the same
thing also **exists differently**]{.underline}. [All
objects]{.underline}, therefore, [**must be defined** via their **scale
of interaction**]{.underline} and perception. In short, [scale **changes
everything** because it **changes what every thing means**]{.underline}.

Second, because [scale]{.underline} deals with perspective, it [is
**intertwined** with]{.underline} notions of [the subject]{.underline},
[experience]{.underline}, consciousness, [and
interpretation]{.underline}. In applying scale to the body you call
"mine" you find yourself looped into a disorienting question: whose body
is it? The atoms'? The cells'? The planets'? The galaxies'? While this
may seem absurd, this conundrum is already necessitated by scale and is,
I argue, the most fundamental challenge presented by scale. We can only
pretend that objects and relations exist "in themselves" and apart from
these scalar delineations if we leave our conception of ourselves
intact. Doing so makes [scale]{.underline} inevitably abstract; it
[permits us to treat scalar objects as just any other objects and scalar
relations as just more relations]{.underline}. [But scale **ties** those
relations back to our]{.underline} usual **[experience]{.underline}**,
saying that what I am is already atoms, cells, planets, galaxies. But
then who is scaling?

Finally, scale reworks our notions of process, relation, and
organization. Scale presents not only new objects but a tangle of new
relations in two senses: first, [scale reveals relationships that were
**previously not apparent** simply because they were **not
discernible**]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} in turn, scale [provides
new possibilities for **comprehending** these aggregates and
relations]{.underline}. [Schemes of control and
force]{.underline}---[whether called]{.underline}
"**[top-down]{.underline}**," "**[bottom-up]{.underline}**," the "great
chain of being," [or **hierarchy**]{.underline} of things---[contain
presumptions about scale that are **revised** when we carefully examine
this apparatus]{.underline}.

The center of this book (Part II) directly addresses these
reconfigurations, with a chapter devoted to each. But because scale
entails a particular, counterintuitive way of thinking, we must first
experiment with this way of thinking and attempt to make this term
"scale" clear. Thus, Part I provides a series of thought experiments
that define the parameters of scale as I am using it here and train the
reader in thinking in terms of scale.

The Philosophical Status of Scale

Before we begin these experiments, I want to highlight a few ways that
scale has been positioned in theoretical conversations. In discussions
of the "ontological status of scale," [scholars tend to be
**critical**]{.underline} of the concept partially [because it is
**unclear** what scale is]{.underline}.4 Even in accounts favorable to
scale, [scale is said to be an]{.underline} "**[arbitrary mental
device]{.underline}** which allows us to make sense of our existence."5
Or perhaps, "merely a way for humans to perceive and comprehend the
world."6 [Or]{.underline}, as one geographer put it, "[there is **no
such thing**]{.underline} as scale."7 Stripped of their diminutive
qualities, these statements are partially correct: [scale is a
conceptual device]{.underline} that allows us to make sense of our
existence, [but **not**]{.underline} one which is **[entirely
arbitrary]{.underline}**. Scale provides a way for humans to perceive
and comprehend the world, but one that is essential and not necessarily
tied to humans. Finally, scale does not exist, in the sense that
"[scale]{.underline}" [itself is not an **entity** but a **reference**
for the structure of phenomena]{.underline}. The diminutive qualities of
each of these statements relegates scale in relation to the social, the
epistemological, and the ontological, respectively. But scale is not
quite any of these.

[To say that scale is **ontological** would imply that scale **exists
already** as a]{.underline} kind of entity or [fact of the
world]{.underline}. [To say that scale is **epistemological** would
imply that it is a way of **learning** about or **accessing** the
world]{.underline}. [To say that scale is a **social structure** would
imply that scale is **one among many conceptual
frameworks**]{.underline} that society has built for mapping the world.
And yet, scale relies both on the "being" of phenomena and a reference
to the one who is measuring as a means of coming to know being. If we
take the whole scaling process into account, considering whether scale
is an epistemological, ontological, or social construct has less
meaning. Rather, [scale functions at a level **above ontology** and
**epistemology**]{.underline}: [scale is a means of **orienting
yourself** both to experience and to the being of things]{.underline}.
[It is a **metaphenomenal structure** that makes use of a **consistent
measure** to **compare** and **calibrate ourselves** to
phenomena]{.underline}. [Scale]{.underline} does not arise solely from
beings (the ontological) or our mode of accessing beings (epistemology),
but rather [is a way of **systematically organizing** and **comparing**
phenomena as they appear]{.underline}. Scale is an addendum and a
reflecting back on what is discovered phenomenologically, first through
attending to the presentation of the world and then systematically
extending this presentation using a defined measure. In turn, [the
**consistency** of this defined measure]{.underline} then accounts for
the way we are dividing reality, which [means that scale **cannot be
solely a social construct**]{.underline}.

[Once discovered]{.underline}, [scale becomes a **necessary conceptual
adjunct to any mode of inquiry**]{.underline}---[whether we want to
speak of]{.underline} objects (**[ontology]{.underline}**), our learning
about objects (**[epistemology]{.underline}**), [or]{.underline} our way
of organizing, speaking about, and distributing reality
(**[sociality]{.underline}**)---[since the objects in question are
**only** understood through the reorientation mapped by
**scale**]{.underline}. Studying a cell only becomes possible once we
extend our perceptual apparatus to sufficient resolution to identify
cells, but it only becomes coherent when scale orients us to this
perception. [**Regardless** of]{.underline} the
**[ontology]{.underline}** of the cell (whether it actually exists),
[its **epistemological status**]{.underline} (how we find out about it),
[or]{.underline} the **[social aspects]{.underline}** that go into its
discovery (the training required to use a microscope), [scale is
**required** to understand what we mean]{.underline} by "cell."

[Scale provides us with a **reference point** to take note of **how any
phenomenon compares to any other**]{.underline}. [Doing so permits us to
**systematically attend** to how what is is **revised** and
**structured** as beings]{.underline} dissolve, shift,
[combine]{.underline}, [layer]{.underline}, [and relate to each other
**differently** depending on the **scale of examination**]{.underline}.
Scale does not mediate our access to the world; it permits us to make
sense of mediated, extended, and projected experience. This status makes
the scalar relation unlike any other kind of relation we find ourselves
in. When we say that the Earth is made of rocks and the rocks are made
of atoms, we are suggesting that the very being of each phenomenon is
made up of, contained by, and holds reference to the others.

#### [Ground]{.underline}. Allowing the aff to pick the scale of comparison is [unpredictable]{.underline} and [non-reciprocal]{.underline} because they get offense based on scaling a method [down]{.underline} to debate.

#### [Critical rigor]{.underline}. Scalar competition ensures that critical debates generate [new forms of life]{.underline} instead of [self-righteous skeptics]{.underline}.

This last option is not readily apparent in Latour's philosophy, even as
he moves from "critique to concern" in his reckoning with the science
wars. [This simple question]{.underline}---**[what are we talking
about?]{.underline}**---[points us to the ways that]{.underline}
scientific [descriptions **pull us out** of the scale at which we live
and require that we **adjust our**]{.underline}
this-**[scale]{.underline}** behavior on the basis of this reconfiguring
of reality. On the one hand, this is all the more reason we need to
figure out new ways to keep intact these matters of fact, so that we can
make these extensions with some degree of confidence. On the other hand,
these matters of fact are not enough. They become matters of concern not
because they are constructed equally by other actants but because they
run into tension with a this-scale, human way of understanding
reality---when I have [to **reconcile**]{.underline} the struggles of my
life (paying rent, keeping a job, raising my kids) with [the confusing
scalar implications that **connect together** one scalar
object]{.underline} (economics) [with another]{.underline} (ecology) [in
a way that is **not immediately apparent** and **easy to
grasp**]{.underline}.

In this light, we can wonder about Latour's move to concern. While I am
sympathetic with his echoing of Haraway's aim for a
[discourse]{.underline} designed "to protect and to care," "matters of
concern" [seems to]{.underline} also [imply an overbearing scrutiny
**regardless** of whether or not the thing is **clearly
understood**]{.underline}---[or even if we're certain that we're
**talking about the same thing**]{.underline}.35 Is this not already
what happens when science becomes entangled in a concern---about
vaccines, climate change, women's bodies, health-care systems, fracking
sites, clean water, or mask mandates? Latour argues that facts are
closed while points of concern are open, ready to be composed and
recomposed. Yet both facts and these points of concern run into the
problem of doxa, the marriage of opinion with social expectation, where
[everyone proceeds as if the issues at hand are **clear** and the points
of concern are **shared**]{.underline}. In addition, we can follow
Latour's concern about critique and consider the affect here: does
concern not imply worry, of being concerned about your neighbor, certain
that something is wrong, that I must get involved and intervene? Is this
not the unfortunate result of this insistent sociality? Like parents
concerned about their teenager who has been staying out late---and have
you seen what he's been wearing? (and he spends so much time alone)---we
find ourselves plagued with an excess of concern as we contemplate our
scalar entanglements. Is this the attitude with which we will approach
our dear Gaia or our fellow actants?

In this light, [we can]{.underline} further reposition the idea of
critique and push against Latour's critique of critique in order to
[rediscover this **more strictly critical maneuver**]{.underline}:
[discovering what is **not understood** in what we **think** we
understand]{.underline}. Latour's characterization of critique is both
egoic and suspicious, as if the critical move is inherently (1) about
me, the critic, getting the upper hand, being more informed, and less
naive, and (2) wary or even disdainful of the thing that is being
critiqued. Certainly, [there is]{.underline} a real target here (Latour
puts his early work among them), and we need to scrub criticism of this
attitude.36 But Latour uses that characterization to throw out what
remains [an **essential move**]{.underline}: [attending to the
**conditions**]{.underline}, **[parameters]{.underline}**,
**[limits]{.underline}**, [and **implications** of a mode of
knowledge]{.underline}. [Critique does not have to be
**suspicious**]{.underline}; [it does not need to **reduce** an object
to something else]{.underline} (e.g., [your **distress** to a **death
drive**]{.underline}); [it does not need to be an **ego trip** where you
are the **enlightened one bearing the truth** to the
ignorant]{.underline}. Latour mixes up the general tenor of "being
critical" with the Kantian operation he insists that we get beyond: the
task of observing how, within any particular experience, there are
conditions, assumptions, and components that we may not be aware of but
that can and should be examined.

It simply is not true that "what performs a critique cannot also
compose."37 [Criticism is needed because we **already suppose too much**
about reality]{.underline}. [There are already social
practices]{.underline}, [languages]{.underline}, [cultural
regulations]{.underline}, [personal sentiments]{.underline},
[technological infrastructures]{.underline}, [genetic
inheritances]{.underline}, [energy grids]{.underline}, [oil
sources]{.underline}, [residual wastes **slowly dissolving** in the
ocean]{.underline}---[all of which must be **examined** and **reopened**
for us to forge **new forms of existence**]{.underline}. Is it not
strange that Latour would say that "With a hammer . . . you can do a lot
of things . . . but you cannot repair, take care, assemble, reassemble,
stitch together"?38 Need I point out that people do all kinds of repairs
and assembling with a hammer? Surely Latour, who would so readily have
us rethink our conception of science, politics, and things, understands
that if you're going to repave a road, you must first dig it up?

How bewildering! Do we know what we are haggling about?
[This]{.underline}, it seems to me, [is the **fundamental question**
brought on by a **basic critical impulse**]{.underline}: **[what is it
that we are talking about?]{.underline}** **[Is it as clear as it seems
to be?]{.underline}** I'm not taking the strategy shared by Bloor and
Sokal and simply accusing Latour of obscurantism; rather, I am pointing
to a set of more basic questions prompted by a different affect meant to
set stage for a different conversation. What is Latour referring to, for
instance, by "nature" when he insists that "ecology seals the end of
nature"?39 When he says "all the various notions of nature" does he mean
Emerson's nature and the one that evolved in frontier America, and the
national parks movement, and the one assumed by physicists, and the one
environmentalists are trying to save? No. In Latour's own work he means
particular notions and stances tied to this term "nature," such as the
world conceived as a place apart or an object to be dominated by a
knowing subject. Such aspects, uncovered by critique, do not themselves
totalize "nature" in a way that warrants such strong dismissals.

In their deconstructive form, [these questions arise]{.underline} from
bewilderment, in the not-understanding and confusion that is taken as
neither mine (my inability to understand, my not being properly trained
in your discipline) nor yours (your obscurantism) but [as a way past
**pretending to understand** or that there is **only one way** that
descriptions work]{.underline}, [experiences are
configured]{.underline}, [or actions are performed]{.underline}. **[What
are we even talking about?]{.underline}** **[To what does it
apply?]{.underline}** **[How might that be understood?]{.underline}**
**[How do we know it?]{.underline}** **[What is not accounted
for]{.underline}** in this articulation or mode of
knowing**[?]{.underline}** **[How can we work with it?]{.underline}** In
their most productive forms, these questions hinge on wonder: I wonder
what X is? What if we try X? **[How does X relate to Y?]{.underline}**
Can there be something else here? Bewilderment is the feeling one gets
in a tangle, the "confusion arising from losing one's way"; it is the
acknowledgment of the labyrinthine form of our attempt to understand
where we are, what we are doing, and what we are saying (OED). Wonder
arises from the astonishment with objects, things, ideas. The two
affects are complementary, both moving us to appreciate anew and ask
again, more carefully, with less certainty and more interest.40

The same questions could be asked of **[skeptical]{.underline}**
scientists such as Sokal when they adopt the same strong [modes of
rhetoric]{.underline}, which [assume **too much common ground** in the
understanding of the **terms** and **acceptable forms of
proof**]{.underline}. [Skepticism]{.underline} is the counterpart to
critical suspicion; it [risks **hiding** the need to
**specify**]{.underline}, **[trace conditions]{.underline}**, [and
**withhold certainty** behind an **egoic**]{.underline}, **[superior
affect]{.underline}**. In [this]{.underline} form, as Latour fairly
notes, skepticism [has been excellent for]{.underline}
"**[debunking]{.underline}** quite a lot of [beliefs]{.underline},
powers, and illusions," [but it is also **reaching its
limits**]{.underline}.41 [The problem arises when scientists make
skepticism into an **attitude** based in authority and **mistake**
their]{.underline} highly regimented [mode of specification for the
**only mode** of parsing the world]{.underline}.42

By way of illustration, one can wonder what would have happened if Carl
Sagan had taken a different approach in the conversation he recounts at
the beginning of Demon-Haunted World. There, he finds himself in the car
with a driver who, upon finding out that he's "that scientist guy,"
begins to question him about "frozen extraterrestrials languishing in an
Air Force base near San Antonio, 'channeling' . . . , crystals, the
prophecies of Nostradamus, astrology, the shroud of Turin." With each
new topic, says Sagan, "I had to disappoint him. 'The evidence is
crummy,' I kept saying. 'There's a much simpler explanation.'"43
[Instead of]{.underline} being skeptical, [assuming the role as the
**arbiter of truth**]{.underline}, [and simply **recounting the evidence
for** and **against such things**]{.underline}, Sagan could have asked
something different: to what is he referring? I've wondered about
channeling . . . what is it describing? Why are we so certain these are
spirits? What do we mean by that? Undoubtedly these questions can be
disarming, and they probably would have confused the driver. But, if
done with more nuance and less ego, [this approach can respect that
there is some **configuration** toward reality being expressed
here]{.underline}. **[What is it?]{.underline}** [These
questions]{.underline}, if adequately shared, [can induce a **mutual
bewilderment** from which we can start to have a **conversation** about
these different kinds of questions]{.underline}, [what they apply
to]{.underline}, [why we hold to them]{.underline}, [and what they serve
to do]{.underline}.

It certainly is harder to have this kind of conversation with ideas like
Atlantis. But many of the things described by science are closer to
Atlantis than they are to the immediacies of one's life---and harder to
wrap one's head around. In science, bewilderment is thus the first step
toward working with these broader difficulties and reorientations. This
is the method of the current project: it began with a bewilderment (how
is it possible that I am simultaneously atoms, cells, quarks, ecologies,
galaxies?) and a wondering (how does this apparatus function? Why does
it show up in everything from descriptions of mystical union with God to
descriptions of ecological entrainment? But also: have you seen the
"Inner Life of the Cell"?!).44 The method then proceeded by
criticism---a [tracing]{.underline} of [the **conditions** under which
**scale can be articulated**]{.underline}---but also through other
methods of textual exegesis, historical questioning, comparative
analysis, and thought experiment. In many ways, I can hardly get past
the first detail, the basic structure of scale; I keep unfolding more
considerations out of this fractal question that might simply be reduced
to a word, with an affect: scale?!

Yet as the breadth of this inquiry implies, such bewilderment [can be
productive of **new avenues of discussion** as we **unfold a simple
point in the many contexts in which it inevitably
applies**]{.underline}. [It is an invitation to **step back** from the
things assumed]{.underline} (the critical maneuver, but here performed
mutually, starting first with the critic's confusion and willingness to
admit an impasse) [but also to **specify**]{.underline} (Say more about
what you mean by that? I'm not sure that we're talking about the same
thing. I've often wondered . . .). Perhaps [such an affect and
intellectual stance are **difficult** to maintain]{.underline}. But I
wonder if this is only [because we get **so involved** in the
matter]{.underline}, [concerned about its **implications**]{.underline},
[its **problematic uses**]{.underline}, [its **terrible
associations**]{.underline}, [its **naïveté**]{.underline}. My
experience is that [such conversations end in **discord** primarily
because someone]{.underline}, [at some point]{.underline}, [invokes
**authority**]{.underline}, [insists on]{.underline} his
\[[their]{.underline}\] **[understanding]{.underline}**, [or simply
**runs out of energy**]{.underline} (pick it up again tomorrow?). Is
this not a practice for humanists to take up: helping ourselves and
others step back from this insistent sense of knowing, to trace these
disjunctures, and help ourselves navigate these bewildering
transformations of our existence?45

**[t]{.mark}**heory]{.underline}, [[sexual orientation and book

contentious** and **deeply divisive** issues in politics are anchored
**in the classroom**]{.underline}]{.mark} and playing out in school
boards across America.

[[Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark} across the country have been
[[zeroing in on]{.mark} how social issues are covered by
**[teachers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including lessons on race, gender
identity, sexual orientation and more. At least 35 states have
introduced what is being called anti-critical race theory legislation
that limits lessons about race and inequality which are perceived to be
divisive by Republican bill supporters.

The country saw the [[power of]{.underline}]{.mark} \"parental rights\"
and [[education play out in]{.mark} the [Virginia]{.mark}
election]{.underline}, [where the now-[governor]{.mark} was [propelled
to victory by focusing on **those**]{.mark} **exact
[issues]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Experts say that [Democrats have to pay
**close attention** to these debates]{.underline} and shift the
conversation away from the culture wars to avoid losses at the ballot
box [in **2022**]{.underline}. But students themselves are caught in the
middle, especially those in vulnerable groups who are suffering as a
result, experts say.

Parental Rights

While education has always been a key issue in America, it has gained
steam in the past two years a proxy for the culture wars that were
intensified during the pandemic. Many Republicans have been pushing back
against what they believe to be aspects of public education systems run
amok, first with COVID-related restrictions and then with issues like
race and sexuality, attempting to restrict and refocus discussions. The
Florida legislature recently passed the deeply controversial Parental
Rights Education Bill, dubbed the \"Don\'t Say Gay\" bill by LGBTQ
activists, which would limit what some classrooms can teach about sexual
orientation and gender identity.

Under the new legislation, these lessons \"may not occur in kindergarten
through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or
developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state
standards.\" It\'s an effort that gives parents and guardians more
control over what their children learn in school and that opponents say
is overly broad. Similar bills from Republican legislators restricting
LGBTQ education have crept up in several other states, including
Tennessee, Arkansas, Montana and Georgia.

However, a new ABC News/IPSOS poll found that 62% of Americans oppose
legislation that would prohibit classroom lessons about sexual
orientation or gender identity in elementary school, while 37% of
Americans support legislation that would. There have also been attempts
to impart issues like structural racism and comprehensive sex education
into school curricula. Especially since protests sparked by the killing
of George Floyd, there has been a renewed push to highlight the role of
racism in American history and institutions.

Many of those [[efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} have been [[lumped under
the banner of]{.underline}]{.mark} \"[**[c]{.mark}**ritical
**[r]{.mark}**ace **[t]{.mark}**heory]{.underline},\" a discipline in
higher education that teaches about racism in U.S legal systems. [While
it is not taught]{.underline} in K-12 classes, many
[legislators]{.underline} have been [invoking **c**ritical **r**ace
**t**heory broadly in]{.underline} their [arguments to]{.underline}
attempt to [restrict discussions of race in the classroom]{.underline}.
What is taught in schools has typically been a state and local issue
(with relatively recent exceptions like No Child Left Behind), impacting
governor races across the country, according to experts. However, many
[[experts]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[predict]{.underline}]{.mark} that
the [[importance]{.mark} of education]{.underline} may [[**extend
nationally** to the **midterm**]{.mark}
**election[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

A [[recent]{.underline}]{.mark} CNN [[poll found]{.mark} that [81% of
respondents said education was]{.mark}]{.underline} either
**[[extremely]{.underline}]{.mark}** or very
**[[important]{.underline}]{.mark}** to them [heading into the 2022
elections]{.underline}. Shavar Jeffries, the national president of
political advocacy organization Democrats for Education Reform, said he
believed that growing frustrations from parents on their involvement in
education may be swaying them at the polls. Jeffries pointed to
Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin\'s win in Virginia, after making
education a centerpiece of his campaign and promising to "invest more in
schools, raise teacher pay, and demand better performance from our
schools.\" His slogan: \"parents matter.\" "The 2022 midterms will hinge
on Democrats' ability to learn from these lessons and lead on
education," said Jeffries in a press release on Youngkin\'s win.

Republicans steer education debate

Joanna Rodriguez, a spokesperson for the Republican Governor
Association, told ABC News that Republican governors said they are
hearing from parents that they want a say in their children\'s
education. Now, governors are channeling that energy, and believe a
parent\'s say \"needs to be codified into law.\"

Most, if not all, legislation that restricts LGBTQ content or race
education in schools comes from Republican legislators. \"As we begin to
see those successes \-- with those surface-level successes, and public
opinion changing \-- we also begin to have these very big conversations
around the nation\'s history and inequality within the nation\'s
history,\" Rigueur told ABC News. The debate even made it into the White
House, with the Trump administration issuing its 1776 Report in
opposition to the 1619 project which reframes the story of America by
placing \"slavery and its continuing legacy at the center of the
\[country\'s\] national narrative,\" according to the project website.

Rigueur said that so-called \"culture warriors\" are trying to
[[channel]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**fears** and
**vulnerabilities**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}]{.mark} some
[[parents]{.underline}]{.mark} to turn back the clock on social
progress. \"**[[One of the fastest ways to get parents to rally around a
cause is to]{.mark} \[[imply]{.mark}\] that [schools are teaching
something that\'s inappropriate ... something
dangerous]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" Rigueur said. \"[It is a
**relatively easy** way to get parents]{.underline}, [who often feel
powerless]{.underline} in the education process, [deeply invested in
order to change]{.underline} both [the **curriculum** and]{.underline}
the **[subject matter]{.underline}** that their children have access
to.\"

**Wright '20** --- Thomas; Director of the Center on the United States
and Europe and a Senior Fellow in the Project on International Order and
Strategy at the Brookings Institution. April 2020; "The Folly of
Retrenchment"; *Foreign Affairs*;
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2020-02-10/folly-retrenchment>;
//CYang

The [**realists** and the **progressives**]{.underline} arguing for
[retrenchment]{.underline} differ in their assumptions, logic, and
intentions. The [realists]{.underline} tend to be more [pessimistic
about the prospects for peace and frame]{.underline} their [arguments in
**hardheaded terms**]{.underline}, whereas the progressives
[downplay]{.underline} the [consequences of American withdrawal and
make]{.underline} a [moral case against]{.underline} the [current grand
strategy]{.underline}. But they share a common claim: that the United
States would be better off if it dramatically reduced its global
military footprint and security commitments. 

[This is a **false promise**]{.underline}, for a number of reasons.
First, [retrenchment]{.underline} would [worsen regional security
competition in **Europe** and **Asia**]{.underline}. The realists
recognize that the [U.S. military presence in Europe and
Asia]{.underline} does [dampen **security competition**]{.underline},
but they claim that it does so at [too high a
price](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/restraint-new-foundation-us-grand-strategy)
--- and one that, at any rate, should be paid by U.S. allies in the
regions themselves. Although pulling back [would invite regional
**security competition**]{.underline}, realist retrenchers admit, the
United States could be safer in a more dangerous world because regional
rivals would check one another. This is a perilous gambit, however,
because [regional conflicts]{.underline} often [end up implicating U.S.
interests]{.underline}. [They]{.underline} might thus [end up drawing
the **U**nited **S**tates back in]{.underline} after it has left ---
[resulting in a **much more dangerous** venture than heading
off]{.underline} the [conflict in the first place]{.underline} by
staying. Realist retrenchment reveals a hubris that the United States
can control consequences and prevent crises from erupting into war. 

The progressives' view of regional security is similarly flawed. These
retrenchers reject the idea that regional security competition will
intensify if the United States leaves. In fact, they argue, U.S.
alliances often promote competition, as in the Middle East, where U.S.
support for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has emboldened
those countries in their cold war with Iran. But this logic does not
apply to Europe or Asia, where U.S. allies have behaved responsibly. A
U.S. [pullback]{.underline} from those places is more likely to
[embolden the **regional powers**]{.underline}. Since 2008,
[Russia]{.underline}
has [[invaded]{.underline}](https://www.cfr.org/interactive/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-ukraine) two
of its [neighbors that are not **members of NATO**]{.underline}, [and if
the Baltic states were no longer protected by]{.underline} a [U.S.
security guarantee]{.underline}, it is [conceivable]{.underline} that
[Russia would test the boundaries with]{.underline} gray-zone
[warfare]{.underline}. [In East Asia]{.underline}, a [U.S.
withdrawal]{.underline} would force [Japan]{.underline} to increase its
defense capabilities and change its constitution to enable it to compete
with [China]{.underline} on its own, [straining relations with **So**uth
**Ko**rea]{.underline}.

The [second problem]{.underline} with retrenchment [involves **nuclear
proliferation**]{.underline}. If the United States pulled out of NATO or
ended its alliance with Japan, as many realist advocates of retrenchment
recommend, some of its [allies]{.underline}, [no longer protected by the
U.S. **nuclear umbrella**]{.underline}, would be [tempted to acquire
nuclear weapons]{.underline} of their own. Unlike the progressives for
retrenchment, the realists are comfortable with that result, since they
see deterrence as a stabilizing force. Most Americans are not so
sanguine, and rightly so. There are good reasons to worry about [nuclear
proliferation](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-10-15/do-nuclear-weapons-matter):
[nuclear materials]{.underline} could [end up in the hands of
**terrorists**]{.underline}, [states with less experience]{.underline}
might be [more prone to **nuclear accidents**]{.underline}, [and nuclear
powers in **close proximity** have **shorter response times**
and]{.underline} thus [conflicts]{.underline} among them [have a
**greater chance** of spiraling into escalation]{.underline}.

Third, [retrenchment]{.underline} would [heighten **nationalism** and
**xenophobia**]{.underline}. [In Europe]{.underline}, a [U.S.
withdrawal]{.underline} would [send]{.underline} the
[message]{.underline} that [every country must **fend for
itself**]{.underline}. It would therefore [empower]{.underline} the
[far-right groups]{.underline} already making this claim --- such as
the [Alternative for Germany]{.underline}, the [League in
Italy]{.underline}, and the [National Front in France]{.underline} ---
while undermining the centrist democratic leaders there who told their
populations that they could rely on the United States and NATO. As a
result, [Washington]{.underline} would [lose leverage over]{.underline}
the [domestic politics of **individual allies**]{.underline},
[particularly]{.underline} younger and more [**fragile democracies**
such as Poland]{.underline}. And since these nationalist populist
groups are almost always protectionist, retrenchment would damage U.S.
economic interests, as well. Even more alarming, many of the [right-wing
nationalists]{.underline} that retrenchment would empower have [called
for **greater accommodation** of China and Russia]{.underline}.

A fourth problem concerns regional stability after global retrenchment.
The [most likely end state is
a **s**pheres-**o**f-**i**nfluence system]{.underline}, [whereby China
and Russia dominate their neighbors]{.underline}, but [such an order is
**inherently unstable**]{.underline}. The [lines of
demarcation]{.underline} for such spheres tend to be
[unclear]{.underline}, [and there is no guarantee]{.underline} that
[China and Russia will not seek to **move them outward**]{.underline}
over time. Moreover, the United States cannot simply grant other major
powers a sphere of influence --- the countries that would fall into
those realms have agency, too. If the United States
ceded [Taiwan](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-02-15/will-china-seize-taiwan) to
China, for example, the Taiwanese people could say no. The current U.S.
policy toward the country is working and may be sustainable. Withdrawing
support from [Taiwan]{.underline} against its will [would plunge
**cross-strait relations** into chaos]{.underline}. The entire idea of
letting regional powers have their own spheres of influence [has an
imperial air]{.underline} that is [at odds with modern principles of
sovereignty and **i**nternational **law**]{.underline}.

A fifth problem with [retrenchment]{.underline} is that it [lacks
**domestic support**]{.underline}. The American people may favor greater
burden sharing, but there is no evidence that they are onboard with a
withdrawal from Europe and Asia. As a survey conducted in 2019 by
the [Chicago Council on Global
Affairs](https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/publication/rejecting-retreat) found,
seven out of ten [Americans believe]{.underline} that [maintaining
military superiority makes the **U**nited **S**tates safer]{.underline},
and almost three-quarters think that alliances contribute to U.S.
security. A 2019 [Eurasia Group Foundation
poll](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/9QHRCwpR0mHqMQmCVthSz?domain=egfound.org) found
that over 60 percent of Americans want to maintain or increase defense
spending. As it became apparent that China and Russia would benefit from
this shift toward retrenchment, and as the United States' democratic
allies objected to its withdrawal, the [**domestic political backlash**
would grow]{.underline}. One [result]{.underline} could be a [prolonged
foreign policy debate that]{.underline} would [cause the United States
to **oscillate** between retrenchment and reengagement]{.underline},
[creating uncertainty about]{.underline} its [commitments
and]{.underline} thus [raising the risk of **miscalculation** by
Washington]{.underline}, [its allies]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} its
[rivals]{.underline}.

[Realist and progressive retrenchers]{.underline} like to
[argue]{.underline} that the [architects of the United States' postwar
foreign policy]{.underline} naively [sought to remake the world in its
image]{.underline}. But [the **real revisionists** are those who argue
for **retrenchment**]{.underline}, [a **geopolitical experiment** of
unprecedented scale in modern history]{.underline}. If this camp were to
have its way, [Europe and Asia]{.underline} --- two stable, peaceful,
and prosperous regions that form the two main pillars of the U.S.-led
order --- [would be plunged into an **era of
uncertainty**]{.underline}.

[The global scope of American military power has been described in many
ways: **[hegemony]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[primacy]{.underline}**,
[and **unipolarity**]{.underline}. Brooks, Ikenberry, and Wohlforth
(2012)1 cover the nuances of the terminology well, and I agree with
their preference for the term "Deep Engagement" that Joseph Nye coined
in a 1995 article.2 [The complex patterns and nuances of engagement
remain **[poorly understood]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with a [[focus on
**conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[ignores the **preponderance of
cases**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [where U.S. [forces]{.mark} have been
**[peacefully based]{.mark} for decades**]{.underline}. In short,
[foreign policy has **[focused on the heat instead of]{.mark} the
[light]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [countless studies, essays, and books
on [Vietnam,]{.mark} [Afghanistan, and Iraq]{.mark} stand [in
**contrast** to the **negligible attention** given to]{.mark} countries
where the U.S. maintained large-scale and long-term troop basing such as
**[Belgium]{.mark}**, **[Korea]{.mark}**, **[Turkey]{.mark}**, [and
**Kuwait**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Is the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[an empire?]{.underline} [We may just as well debate whether an elephant
most closely resembles a]{.underline} **[T]{.underline}**yrannosaurus
**[Rex]{.underline}** [or **Triceratops**]{.underline}. [Some will point
to the imperial characteristics]{.underline} that are [reflected in
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[force posture]{.underline}. **[But]{.underline}** [[characteristics
of]{.mark} dinosaurs or [empires]{.mark}]{.underline} (size, martial
strength, breadth) really [[have **no meaning**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[in a world where that]{.mark} entire [order is
**extinct**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The **21st century** is filled with a
**new order**]{.underline} [of **nation-states**]{.underline},
[**markedly different** from eras prior to 1945]{.underline}.

**[American power]{.underline}** [is best understood not by its
type]{.underline}: hard, soft, or smart, [but]{.underline} its
**[motivation]{.underline}**. This is not to say the "imperial"
motivation has disappeared from human affairs; self-preservation and
domination are instinctive human qualities. But [[there is a **new
aspect**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to]{.mark} **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations that has been in place for more than a century, a
form of **[altruism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[illustrated by]{.mark} the
**[widespread support]{.mark}** that exists [in the U.S.]{.mark} and
other countries [for]{.mark} **universal [human
rights]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For many decades now,
[nations]{.underline} have routinely sought to [advance something beyond
their narrow national interests]{.underline}. I call this [a
**Promethean motivation**]{.underline}, and America a Promethean power.

The phrase is rooted in the myth of Prometheus, the rebellious god of
ancient Greek mythology who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to the
human race, sparking the beginning of technology, growth, civilization,
and prosperity. Zeus was the ruler of the Gods of Olympus, archetype of
the emperor/king. The Gods were rulers, and humans were mere subjects.
Prometheus represents rebellion, the trickster God, undercutting the
authority of the imperial order. Legend has it that Prometheus tricked
Zeus --- repeatedly --- in order to help uplift the human race.

[[Critics]{.mark} of American intervention **reflexively** [use the
term]{.mark} **["imperial"]{.mark}** when discussing foreign
affairs]{.underline}. By far the dominant theme of imperialism in
American foreign policy has been voiced by Leftist thinkers such as
Howard Zinn, Gabriel and Joyce Kolko, and Gore Vidal. But since 1990,
the end of the Cold War, **[[neo-isolationists]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[on the right have [adopted the term as well]{.mark}]{.underline},
notably Pat **[Buchanan]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} Congressman Ron
**[Paul]{.underline}**. Thus [the tendency is for thinkers on the
**political extremes**]{.underline} --- globalists on the left,
nationalists on the right --- [to find common cause, whereas centrists
tend to view American power more favorably]{.underline}, as do many
foreign scholars.

Following the 9/11 attacks and concerns about state failure abroad,
proponents of American intervention began suggesting American empire in
explicit and favorable ways. Such voices included Richard Haas,
Sebastian Mallaby, and Max Boot. The fullest expression of this new
theme is found in Colossus, a 2004 book by Niall Ferguson3 (now a
colleague at the Hoover Institution), who argued "not merely that the
United States is an empire, but that it always has been an empire" and
that the ultimate threat to the nation is its own "absence of a will to
power." The book is an unappreciated gem, but one wonders if Ferguson
and his intellectual opponents share the same framework, which refuses
to draw a line between imperial states of the 15th-19th centuries and
the modern states of the 21st.

Ferguson wonderfully skewers the slipperiness of the term hegemon, which
remains "the most popular term among writers on international
relations." [Hegemony]{.underline} refers to a coercive state, like an
empire, but one that aims to [create **mutually beneficial
relationships**]{.underline}. Trying to define the nature of state power
by the distribution of benefits (exploitative or shared) misses the
point. The point is: what are first principles that motivate foreign
action?

America on the world stage should be understood in the context of its
revolutionary founding. The republic's anti-imperial birth and its sense
of manifest destiny have colored foreign affairs from early on. Consider
again Thomas Jefferson's "Empire of Liberty," which was more than a
poetic phrase. In 1809 Jefferson wrote to his successor James Madison,
"I am persuaded no constitution was ever before so well calculated as
ours for extensive empire & self-government." In one of his final
letters, written in 1824, Jefferson wrote, "where this progress will
stop no-one can say. Barbarism has, in the meantime, been receding
before the steady step of amelioration; and will in time, I trust,
disappear from the earth."

To simplify matters, let's accept the framework of definitions on the
Left (and also popularly understood by Americans throughout history).
[Define an empire as a nation that exploits foreign peoples, aiming to
colonize them and/or extract their resources for the
advantage]{.underline} of the empire and at the cost of the foreigners.
And for the sake of clarity, recognize a bright line that distinguishes
imperial relationships as those where subjugated peoples do not want but
are forced to abide by foreign intervention. To be specific, [the U.S.
role in South [Korea **fails the imperial test**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[as does the post-1955 role of the U.S. in [**Germany** and
**Japan**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Those three countries [accounted
for]{.mark} nearly [**three-quarters** of U.S]{.mark}. troop
[deployments]{.mark} since 1950]{.underline}. [Not to mention
**[Spain]{.mark}**, **[Turkey]{.mark}**, [**Taiwan**, and
**Kuwait**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[All]{.mark} of these [are]{.mark}
**[voluntary]{.mark} alliances**]{.underline}, and qualitatively
distinct from forces based in Iraq.

[For the **Leftist criticism**]{.underline} [of American empire to hold,
**[ev]{.mark}**idence [of domination should be **easy**]{.mark} **to
see**]{.underline}. [One would expect to see the countries of the world
that are occupied by American troops suffering economic decline as a
result]{.underline}, or at a minimum a relative decline. [Here **the
[critique falls apart]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
[[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} of the world
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[hosted]{.mark} the greatest number of
American [troops]{.mark} since 1950 [have **grown the fastest**]{.mark}
**economically**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [host countries have
[experienced]{.mark} **faster [declines in child mortality]{.mark}**,
**faster [increase in]{.mark} overall [longevity]{.mark}**, **faster
[growth in infrastructure]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} even greater
[improvements in]{.mark} the broadly measured human development index
(**[HDI]{.mark}**)]{.underline}. Consider as evidence the average
economic growth rates presented in table 2, reproduced from Jones and
Kane (2012).4

The record shows that [**[America's engagement]{.mark}** with allied
nations [is **unequivocally beneficial**]{.mark} for those
countries]{.underline}. But the context is what matters for future
policy choices. **[Public [perceptions]{.mark}]{.underline}** of world
affairs [[are dominated by negatives]{.mark}: bombings in Iraqi cities,
AIDS rampant in Africa, genocides, earthquakes]{.underline}. Foreign
policy experts focus on negatives of a subtler nature: the dilemma over
Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, the poppy trade and corruption in
Afghanistan, the strategic mystery that is China. [**Yet** despite real
and looming crises, the **underlying theme** of the American century is
a **patient march of human prosperity**]{.underline}, [deepening and
broadening as economic growth unfolds in the free world]{.underline}.

[The American strategy of patient, forward deployment of U.S.
troops]{.underline}, even and especially when it is not self-interested,
[has **benefitted our allies and the world**]{.underline}. [America's
engagement in Asia and Europe since 1945 created a security umbrella
fostering **peace** and **unprecedented prosperity**]{.underline}. [If
this model were applied to the Middle East]{.underline} --- supporting
allies rather than hunting monsters --- [it would reshape the region's
future for the better]{.underline}. On this point, Fallows might agree.

[The question]{.underline} that haunts contemporary foreign policy [is
**not** whether the U.S. military is a force for good around the
globe]{.underline}. **[It is]{.underline}**. [The question is: Can
Promethean power be sustained?]{.underline} Does the United States have
the willpower to maintain a forward force posture?

### 1NC --- Econ Brink/Link

#### The economy is on the brink but [public perception]{.underline} matters most.

\"Joe Biden, some economists say recession not imminent, but public
disagrees\"; *Newsweek*;
https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-some-economists-say-recession-not-imminent-public-disagrees-1723995;
//CYang

President Joe Biden has insisted for months that the [U.S. is **not
heading** into a recession]{.underline}, pointing most recently to the
[latest jobs report]{.underline} as [proof the economy is **strong** and
on its way to]{.underline} a **[complete recovery]{.underline}** from
the pandemic.

But economists outside the White House, and many Americans, aren\'t so
sure.

The debate around a potential recession reflects widespread concern
about the state of the economy, underscoring Biden\'s struggle to
convince most Americans that they\'re better off financially under him
than his predecessor --- a long standing litmus test that could spell
doom for Democrats in the midterm elections this fall, and for Biden
should he choose to run again in 2024.

In political terms, [the **public perception** of a weak
economy]{.underline} on the brink of recession may be [**much more
important** than]{.underline} the [official determination]{.underline},
which is made by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private
nonprofit organization known as NBER, which most voters know little
about.

Using the Argument for **[Well-Regulated Capitalism]{.underline}** to
[Diagnose]{.underline} the [Problems with Neoliberalism]{.underline}

The literature on political theory, ethics, and society generally, and
on food ethics specifically, often includes critiques of neoliberalism
as the alleged root of many problems, often as a synonym for the root of
problems with capitalism.31 However, the argument previously made for
[[well-regulated capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} can help
[[focus]{.underline}]{.mark} our [[attention on]{.underline}]{.mark}
what the **[important [problems]{.mark}]{.underline}** are [[with
neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark} ([as well as]{.underline} with [crony
capitalism and]{.underline} other [suboptimal]{.underline} forms of
[capitalism]{.underline}), [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} thus on [what
reforms and progress are **genuinely needed**]{.underline}. Recall that
premise 2 defines [well-regulated capitalism]{.underline} in terms of
the conditions that are necessary (as well as sufficient, given
assumptions like perfect information and complete markets),32 according
to mainstream public and welfare economics, to [[generate **ethically
optimal** outcomes]{.underline}]{.mark}; summarizing premise 2, these
conditions are the following:

1\. [[Regulation of **externalities** and **public
goods**]{.underline}]{.mark}: [optimal regulation of]{.underline}
positive and negative [externalities]{.underline}, including investments
in public goods;

2\. [[Distributive justice]{.underline}]{.mark}: [redistribution to
achieve **equity**]{.underline} and distributive justice;

3\. [[Rule of law]{.underline}]{.mark}: rule of law, clearly defined
property rights, [basic]{.underline} rights as [**side constraints**,
and equitable redistribution for]{.underline} historical [rights
violations]{.underline};

4\. [[Free exchange]{.underline}]{.mark}: free exchange [[subject
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[constraints]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
conditions 1, 2, and 3.

With this definition in hand, we can make a number of observations
relevant to evaluating neoliberalism.

First, [well-regulated capitalism]{.underline} need [not ignore
**equity** and **justice**]{.underline}. It is [consistent
with]{.underline} disagreement about what [redistribution]{.underline}
should happen [for purposes of equity]{.underline}; some proponents
favor large-scale redistribution, while others endorse a conception of
equity that favors only minimal redistribution. What all proponents
agree on is that whatever form of [[redistribution]{.underline}]{.mark}
we need, it [should happen within]{.underline} the [**structural
framework** of well-regulated capitalism]{.underline}. Similarly,
proponents might disagree about the empirical reasons for how big the
externality is associated with [[GHG emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
they agree on the basic framework of how they [should be addressed
within]{.underline} the [theory of externalities]{.underline} and within
this [structure of well-regulated capitalism]{.underline}, more
generally. [[Neither]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[concern for **equity**
nor]{.underline}]{.mark} a concern for [**[externalities]{.mark}** such
as environmental pollution [provides]{.mark} a [reason to reject
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} per se, as we saw above.

Indeed, [well-regulated capitalism]{.underline} is [[consistent with
**radical redistribution**]{.underline}]{.mark}. If, for example, large
[reparations]{.underline} are required [due to]{.underline} the
[historical injustices]{.underline} of colonialism, slavery, and
resulting inequities, then [well-regulated capitalism
implies]{.underline} that [**large redistributions** and
corrections]{.underline} should [happen as a matter of distributive
justice]{.underline} (condition 2) [and rule of law]{.underline}
(condition 3). The [argument for well-regulated capitalism]{.underline}
does not itself take a stand on such specific issues, but rather
[argues]{.underline} that insofar as a [[correction of inequity]{.mark}
and injustice is required]{.underline}, it [[should happen
within]{.underline}]{.mark} this [**structural [framework]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} well-regulated [capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Second, the word "[neoliberalism]{.underline}" is often used to refer to
[a **particular undesirable** form of capitalism that falls **far
short**]{.underline} of well-regulated capitalism. Note that in ordinary
language, [economic systems that depart from]{.underline} the
[ideal]{.underline} of well-regulated [capitalism are still regarded
as]{.underline} forms of [capitalism]{.underline}, insofar as they
involve free exchange, the rule of law, and clearly defined property
rights (in other words, the nonnormative parts of free exchange
(condition 4) and the procedural justice components of the rule of law
(condition 3)).33 Neoliberalism is often used to refer to forms of
capitalism that incorporate only these limited features and none of the
others. This [brings into clear focus why such]{.underline} a form of
capitalism [is undesirable]{.underline} --- because ignoring pollution,
inequity, injustice, and failing to provide public goods in such a way
leads to much worse outcomes for society than are possible, and outcomes
that are highly unjust. However, proponents of capitalism would insist
that [[the]{.mark} **best [solution]{.mark}** [is to
adopt]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[better form]{.mark} of
capitalism]{.underline} closer to the ideal [that includes concerns
for]{.underline} the [regulation of externalities and public
goods]{.underline} (condition 1), [distributive justice]{.underline}
(condition 2), [and]{.underline} all aspects of [the rule of
law]{.underline} (condition 3).

### AT: Racial Capitalism

#### Racial capitalism doesn't have [causal explanatory power]{.underline}.

**Go, 21**---Professor of Sociology, University of Chicago (Julian,
"Three Tensions in the Theory of Racial Capitalism," Sociological
Theory, Volume 39, Issue 1, 2021, dml)

Despite this emerging
literature, [the **relevance** of]{.underline} existing [discussions of
racial capitalism]{.underline} for sociological
theory [remains **unclear**]{.underline}. [What might
the]{.underline} racial capitalism [literature teach us
about **theories** or **conceptual frameworks**]{.underline} around race
and capitalism? The problem is that [the term racial capitalism **does
not refer** to a]{.underline} "**[theory]{.underline}**" [in the sense
of a]{.underline} "**[singular logically integrated causal
explanation]{.underline}**" (Calhoun 1995:5). [The term
refers **broadly** to relationships between racial inequality and
capitalism]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} the literature [**does not
specify** a single set of **causal
relations** or **connections** between them]{.underline}. [Nor does the
literature offer **uniform concepts** or a **shared conceptual
apparatus**]{.underline}. Given this, does the racial capitalism
literature---by which I mean the scholars across different disciplines
who centralize the term racial capitalism---have any relevance for
theory at all?1

#### Racial hierarchy isn't [metaphysically intrinsic]{.underline} to capitalism, [even if]{.underline} the two are [empirically]{.underline}connected.

**Go, 21**---Professor of Sociology, University of Chicago (Julian,
"Three Tensions in the Theory of Racial Capitalism," Sociological
Theory, Volume 39, Issue 1, 2021, dml)

The final [tension within racial capitalism is whether the
interconnectedness of racial difference and capitalism is
a **logical** or **contingent** necessity]{.underline}.6 [If]{.underline}, as
the racial capitalism literature suggests, [slavery and its associated
logics of racism have been **crucial** for]{.underline} the development
of [capitalism]{.underline}, [and
if]{.underline} global [capitalism]{.underline} today [**remains
intertwined** with racial stratification]{.underline}, [to **what
extent** are these relations **intrinsic** to capitalism
or **accidental**]{.underline}? Put differently, [is
capitalism **necessarily racist**]{.underline} (Fraser 2019; Lemann
2020)?7

For some, the relationship is only contingent. Walzer (2020) argued
that [in **some** countries]{.underline}, [capitalism **proceeds along
just fine**without racial difference]{.underline}, and if there
is [racial difference on a **global scale**]{.underline},
it [is **historically contingent**]{.underline}. [Although the **vast
majority** of workers are **nonwhite**]{.underline}, Walzer suggested
that [this is **not** due to any **intrinsic logic** of capitalism but
rather the **accident of
demographics**]{.underline} ([because **most** of the world
is **nonwhite**]{.underline}, [the **majority** of the world's workers
will be **nonwhite**]{.underline}). For this reason, Walzer suggested we
disavow the racial capitalism concept. Alternatively, others claim that
racism is indeed intrinsic to capitalism.8 There are two versions of
this claim. One is that racism is necessary to divide the working class
and legitimate the rule of the bourgeoisie. Racism is an ideological
necessity of capitalism, justifying its unequal relations (Camp,
Heatherton, and Karuka 2019; McCarthy 2016; Taylor 2016). "Capitalism
requires inequality," suggested Gilmore (2015), "and racism enshrines
it." A very different version, coming most predominantly from Fraser
(2019), is that capitalism necessarily entails relations of exploitation
and expropriation that feed off each other. Exploitation is the
extraction of value from "free subjects" through wage labor. But
expropriation, which includes slavery and colonialism, extracts value
from racialized "dependent subjects" and is what enables exploitation to
happen in the first place. Expropriation is "a necessary background
condition for the exploitation of 'workers'" (Fraser 2019) and therefore
for capitalism itself. Capitalism is thus logically dependent upon
racism.9

So what is the answer? Again, it helps differentiate between a theory of
capital and a theory of capitalism. [A theory of
capitalism **might**demonstrate that race has been historically
necessary for capitalist accumulation by reference to **empirical
reality**]{.underline}: historically, capitalism and race have always
been intertwined. [But the claim that race is a **logical necessity** to
capitalism would have to derive from a **theory of
capital**]{.underline}, **[not from empirics alone]{.underline}**. [One
would have to **deduce**]{.underline}, [from]{.underline} the categories
of Marx's **[theory]{.underline}**, [the **necessity** of
racism]{.underline} or racial differentiation [in
society]{.underline}. [On this score]{.underline}, [the arguments for
the **logical necessity** of capitalism's entanglements with race **fall
short**]{.underline}.

[Consider the argument that]{.underline} racism is necessary for
capitalism because [capitalism **requires** racist ideology
to **divide** the working class]{.underline}. [This is
a **functionalist** argument that is **not functionalist
enough**]{.underline}, for [it **effaces** the logical possibility
of **functional substitution**]{.underline}. [We may find that racism
has **historically always functioned** to divide the working
class]{.underline}, [but **in
theory** other]{.underline} "**[isms]{.underline}**" [could serve
the **same function**]{.underline}. [There is **nothing inherent** to
the logic of capital that **requires** race to be the ideology of
division]{.underline} (Lebowitz 2006:39).10 [Why
not **ethnicity**]{.underline}? Why
not **[sexuality]{.underline}**? [Consider]{.underline}Fraser's [argument
that **expropriation** is **intrinsic** to capitalism and that racial
differentiation **must be too**]{.underline}. [It
is **plausible** and]{.underline} indeed [**persuasive** to claim
that **expropriation** is necessary for
capitalism]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} it is [**less persuasive** to
claim that racial difference is **logically necessary** for
expropriation]{.underline}. [**Gender** could **easily** serve as
the **main axis**of dependent classification]{.underline} (and, to
feminist-Marxist thought, it has served that function), [as
could **ethnicity**]{.underline}, **[religion]{.underline}**, **[sexuality]{.underline}**, [or **citizenship**]{.underline}.
Fraser would have [to show that **expropriation**]{.underline}, [and
hence **capitalism**]{.underline}, [**requires** a racial classification
as opposed to **other** social categories]{.underline}. This [is
a **task left unfulfilled**]{.underline}.11

bring]{.underline} dignity and psychological [**empowerment** when
they produce **no greater material benefits** or **changes in relational
power**]{.underline} ... By standards of 'realism', ... subjects given
to avoidance and 'lumping it' may be the most sophisticated of all.
(1996: 227)

Thus, their criticism boils down to two main points. First, [[everyday
resistance **fails** to tell us]{.mark} any
[more ]{.mark}about so-called **false consciousness** [than was
**already known**]{.mark}]{.underline} among earlier Left theorists;
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} second, that a focus on discursive
resistance [**[ignores]{.mark}** the role of **[material
conditions]{.mark}** in helping to shape identity]{.underline}.

Indeed, [absent a **broader political struggle** or chance at
**effective resistance**]{.underline} it would seem to the authors that
'[[**powerlessness is learned** out of]{.mark} the
**[accumulated]{.mark} experiences of [futility]{.mark}** [and
**entrapment**]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark} (1996: 228). A lamentable
prospect, but nonetheless a source of closure for the governmentality
theorist. In his own meta-analysis of studies on resistance, Rubin
(1996: 242) finds that 'discursive [practices that neither
**alter material conditions**
nor **directly challenge broad structures** are
nevertheless]{.underline}' [considered]{.underline} by the authors he
examined '[the stuff out of which power is **made** and
**remade**]{.underline}'. If this sounds familiar, it is because the
authors studied by McCann, March and Rubin found their claims about
everyday resistance on the same understanding of power and government
employed by postmodern theorists of risk. [[Arguing **against**
celebrating]{.mark} forms of [resistance that **fail to alter
broader**]{.mark} **power [relations]{.mark}** [or **material
conditions** is]{.mark}]{.underline}, in part, [[**recognizing**
the]{.mark} continued '**real**' [existence of]{.mark} **identifiable**,
**[powerful groups]{.mark}**]{.underline} (classes). In downplaying the
worth of [everyday forms of resistance]{.underline} (arguing that these
acts [are **not as worthy** of the label as those acts which bring about
**lasting social change**]{.underline}), Rubin appears to be taking
issue with [a **locally focused vision** of power and
identity]{.underline} that [**denies the possibility** of opposing
domination at the level of '**constructs**']{.underline} such as class.

Rubin (1996: 242) makes another argument about [celebratory [accounts of
everyday resistance]{.mark}]{.underline} that bears consideration:

\[T\]hese authors generally [[**do not differentiate** between practices
that **reproduce**]{.mark} power [and]{.mark} those that [**alter**
power]{.mark}. \[The former\] [might involve pressing that power to
**become more adept at domination** or]{.mark} to [**dominate
differently**, or]{.mark} it might mean [**precluding alternative acts**
that would]{.mark} **more successfully [challenge]{.mark}
power**]{.underline}. ... [\[[I\]t is **necessary to do
more** than]{.mark} show that such discursive acts **[speak
to]{.mark}**, or **engage with**, [power. It **must also be
demonstrated** that such acts **add up to**]{.mark} or **engender
[broader chang]{.mark}es**]{.underline}.

In other words, [some of the acts of everyday resistance **may** in the
**real world**, through their **absorption into mechanisms of
power**, **reinforce the localized domination** that they **supposedly
oppose**]{.underline}. The implications of this argument can be further
clarified when we study the way 'resistance' is dealt with in a risk
society.

Risk theorists already understand that every administrative system has
holes which can be exploited by those who learn about them. That is
[what **makes governmentality work**]{.underline}: the supposed governor
[is]{.underline} in turn governed -- in part through [the
**noncompliance** of subjects]{.underline} (Foucault, 1991a; Rose and
Miller, 1992). For example, where employees demonstrate unwillingness to
embrace technological changes in the workplace, management consultants
can create:

a point of entry, but also a 'problem' that their 'packages' are
designed to resolve. ... In short, consultants readily constitute
certain forms of conduct as 'resistance to technology' as this gives
them some purchase on its reform by identifying a space in which
expertise can be brought to bear in the exercise of power.
[[Resistance]{.underline}]{.mark} consequently [plays the role of
**continuously [provok]{.mark}ing extensions**, **revisions** and
[**refinements** of]{.mark} those **same [practices]{.mark}** which [it
confronts]{.mark}]{.underline}. (Knights and Vurdubakis, 1994: 80)

This appears to be a very different kind of resistance from that
contemplated by Rubin, but perhaps not so different from that of the
authors whom he and McCann and March [[critique]{.underline}]{.mark}:
those [[whose analysis **ends** at]{.mark} the **discursive [production
of noncompliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Instead, the above account
[is]{.underline} of [a resistance that **almost invariably [helps power
to work better]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A conclusion in the present day
that ominously foreshadows the futuristic, dystopic risk assemblage
described by Bogard (1996).

Another example of the 'resolution' of resistance proposed above is the
institution of a tool library described by Shearing (2001: 204--5). In
this parable, a business deals with the issue of tool theft on the part
of workers by installing a 'lending library' of tools instead of
engaging in vigorous prosecution and jeopardizing worker morale. While
the parable is meant to indicate a difference between actuarial and more
traditional (moral) forms of justice, it also demonstrates how [an act
that may be considered '**resistant**' is **incorporated without
conflict** into]{.underline} the workplace loss-prevention scheme -- [an
**eminently preferable**, '**forward-looking**' solution within the
logic of risk management]{.underline}. The same is possible in the case
of more discursive forms of resistance. If I do not see myself as a
Guinness man, for example, market researchers will do their best to
adapt Guinness to the way I do see myself (Miller and Rose, 1997). The
end result, of course, is that I purchase the beer. As manifested in a
form of justice (Shearing and Johnston, 2005), it always consolidates,
tempers emotions, cools the analysis, reconciles factions, and always
relentlessly moves forward, assimilating as it grows. In this sense,
therefore, Bogard's 'social science fiction' actually pre-supposes and
logically extends Shearing's (2001) rather cheery and benevolent
rendering of risk thinking. [In this context of]{.underline}
governmentality [theory]{.underline} -- as self-described and
[**lauded** for its **political non-prescription**]{.underline} by its
own pundits -- [the **acts** or **attitudes described as resistant**
are, **in the end**, **absorbed by those who govern**. Resistance as an
**oppositional force** -- that **pushes against** or has the potential
to **take power** -- is **theoretically** and **politically
neutralized**. In the neutralization process, **power is
reproduced**]{.underline}.

So, along with McCann and March's observations that [everyday
resistance]{.underline} adds little to our understanding of false
consciousness and that it denies the role of material factors in shaping
identity, we can add Rubin's two main criticisms of everyday resistance:
it [relies on an **inaccurate understanding** of power, and acts of
resistance which supposedly emancipate **actually may reinforce
domination**]{.underline}. All four of [these]{.underline} criticisms
[demand the **same thing**: to **know what is really going on**, to get
an **adequate grasp** of the social]{.underline}.

[[Every policy is a **prediction**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Tax
cuts]{.mark} will [boost the economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Sanctions]{.mark} will [slow Iran's nuclear
program]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Travel bans will limit]{.mark} the
**spread of [COVID]{.mark}-19**]{.underline}. These [[claims all posit a
**causal relationship**]{.mark} between **means** and
**ends**]{.underline}. Regardless of party, ideology, or motive, no
policymaker wants ~~his or her~~ \[their\] recommended course of action
to produce unanticipated consequences. This makes [[every policymaker a
**forecaster**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [But forecasting is
difficult]{.underline}, [[particularly when it comes to
**geopolitics**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- a domain in which the rules of
the game are poorly understood, information is invariably incomplete,
and expertise often confers surprisingly little advantage in predicting
future events.

These challenges present practical problems for decision-makers in the
U.S. government. On the one hand, the limits of imagination create blind
spots that policymakers tend to fill in with past experience. They often
assume that tomorrow's dangers will look like yesterday's, retaining the
same mental map even as the territory around them changes dramatically.
On the other hand, if policymakers addressed all imaginable threats, the
United States would need so large and expensive a national security
establishment that the country could do little else. By many measures,
it is nearing this point already. The United States has military bases
in more than 70 countries and territories, boasts more than four million
federal employees with security clearances, and fields 1.3 million
active-duty troops, with another million in reserve. According to one
estimate, the United States spends \$1.25 trillion annually on national
security. When it comes to anticipating the future, then, the United
States is getting the worst of both worlds. It spends untold sums of
money preparing yet still finds itself the victim of surprise ---
fundamentally ill equipped for defining events, such as the emergence of
COVID-19.

There is a [[better way]{.underline}]{.mark}, one that would [allow the
United States [to make decisions based not on **simplistic
extrapolations**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the past [[but]{.mark} on
**smart [estimates]{.mark}** [of the future]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It
involves]{.underline}]{.mark} reconciling two approaches often seen to
be at philosophical loggerheads: [[**scenario planning** and
**probabilistic forecasting**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Each approach has a
fundamentally different assumption about the future. Scenario planners
maintain that there are so many possible futures that one can imagine
them only in terms of plausibility, not probability. By contrast,
forecasters believe it is possible to calculate the odds of possible
outcomes, thereby transforming amorphous uncertainty into quantifiable
risk. Because each method has its strengths, the [optimal
approach]{.underline} is [to **combine them**]{.underline}. This
**[[holistic method]{.underline}]{.mark}** would [[provide policymakers
with]{.underline}]{.mark} both a [[range of **conceivable futures**
and]{.mark} regular updates as to [which]{.mark}]{.underline} one [[is
likely to emerge]{.underline}]{.mark}. For once, they could
[make]{.underline} shrewd [bets about tomorrow]{.underline},
[today]{.underline}.

PLANNING FOR UNCERTAINTY

Although widely used in business today, the first element of this duo
--- [[scenario planning]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[grew out
of]{.underline}]{.mark} post--World War II national security concerns,
specifically the [**overwhelming [uncertainty]{.mark}** of the nuclear
revolution]{.underline}. Previously, martial experience was thought to
offer some guidance through the fog of war. [Nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, however, [presented a novel problem]{.underline}.
With the newfound ability to destroy each other as functioning societies
in a matter of minutes or hours, the United States and the Soviet Union
[faced an **unprecedented situation**]{.underline}. And unprecedented
situations are, by definition, uncertain. They lack any analogy to the
past that would allow decision-makers to calculate the odds of possible
outcomes.

Still, early U.S. efforts at nuclear-war planning sought to turn that
problem into a calculable one. During World War II, the Allies had great
success with the new field of operations research, the application of
statistical methods to improve the outcome of tactical engagements.
After the war, the RAND Corporation --- a "think factory" that the U.S.
Air Force established as a repository for leading researchers --- hoped
to parlay this success into a new, more rational approach to war, based
less on the intuition of generals and more on the quantification
afforded by models and data.

Unfortunately, methods that worked at the tactical level proved nearly
farcical at the strategic level. As the historian David Jardini has
chronicled, RAND's first attempt to model a nuclear strategy ignored so
many key variables that it nonsensically called for deploying a fleet of
aging turboprop bombers that carried no bombs because the United States
did not have enough fissile material to arm them; the goal was simply to
overwhelm Soviet air defenses, with no regard for the lives of the
pilots. In the wake of such failures, it became clear that [[analysts
could not]{.mark} **entirely [banish]{.mark}**
[uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 1960, even Charles Hitch, a man
predisposed to calculation by dint of being RAND's top economist and
president of what was then the Operations Research Society of America,
cautioned, "[No other characteristic of decision-making is as
**pervasive** as uncertainty]{.underline}."

That, of course, [[raised]{.mark} the [question of how to formulate
**sensible strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unexpectedly, it was a RAND
mathematician and physicist, Herman Kahn, who offered an answer. If the
lived past could not shape strategy, perhaps [[the **imagined
future**]{.mark} could]{.underline}. Frustrated with RAND's attempts to
scientize war, Kahn devoted himself to [[crafting
scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} in the pursuit of "ersatz experience"
that would [[prepare the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [for the
future through]{.mark}]{.underline} what were essentially [[thought
experiments]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark}
could [[use]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[scenarios
as]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[artificial]{.underline}]{.mark} '[case
histories]{.underline}' [and]{.underline} '[historical
[anecdotes]{.mark}]{.underline},'" Kahn wrote, thus [[making up
for]{.mark} a [lack of **actual examples** or]{.mark} **meaningful
[data]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They would [provide analogies where there
were none]{.underline}.

Early methods of generating scenarios were often freewheeling and
discursive. But after scenario planning migrated to the business world,
it took on more structured forms. The most recognizable is a two-by-two
matrix in which planners identify two critical uncertainties and, taking
the extreme values of each, construct four possible future worlds.
Regardless of the specific shape they take, [**[rigorous
scenario-planning]{.mark}** exercises]{.underline} all involve
[[identifying key **uncertainties** and]{.underline}]{.mark} then
[[imagining]{.mark} how [different combinations]{.mark}]{.underline}
could [[yield situations]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [[vastly
different from]{.underline}]{.mark} what [**[mere
extrapolation]{.mark}** of the present]{.underline} would suggest. By
then "backcasting" --- taking one of these imagined futures as a given
and asking what conditions produced it --- [scenario planners
[derive]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[a **story** and a
**system**]{.underline}]{.mark}. They come up with a plausible narrative
of how a future happened and an internal logic that describes how it
operates. [[Scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} are not supposed to be
predictive. They are meant to be provocative, [[challenging]{.mark}
**planners' [assumptions]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[shaking]{.underline}]{.mark} up their [**mental [models]{.mark}** [of
how the world works]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[giving
them]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[cognitive flexibility to better
sense]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[shape]{.mark}, [and adapt to the]{.mark}
**emerging [future]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The pandemic has occasioned a renaissance in the use of scenarios, as
organizations from think tanks to technology companies grapple with the
question of what a "new normal" might look like and how soon it might
arrive. But the national security community has long used scenarios to
address some of its most wicked problems --- particularly high-stakes
issues that are in flux, such as the U.S.-Chinese relationship. This
past summer, RAND released a report on Chinese grand strategy. It
concluded with four scenarios that offered brief vignettes of China's
possible place in the world 30 years from now. "Triumphant China"
dominates the world stage in most domains, with a modern military and an
innovative economy. "Ascendant China" is the preeminent power not only
in Asia but in other regions, as well. "Stagnant China" has suffered
from low growth and faces social unrest. And "Imploding China"
experiences a crisis of existential proportions, in which domestic
instability undercuts the country's international influence.

Although comprehensive, the wide range of these scenarios highlights the
chief challenge of the method: If China's potential futures encompass
rise, fall, and everything in between, how can they aid in the
formulation of strategy and policy? Although this cornucopia of
scenarios could lead policymakers to develop strategies that would
improve the United States' position no matter which future comes to
pass, in practice, having too many different versions of the future can
make it nearly impossible to act. [**Good [scenario planning]{.mark}**
[puts boundaries on the future]{.mark}]{.underline}, but those limits
are often not enough [[for **decision-makers** to work
with]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[They]{.underline}]{.mark} need to [[know
which future is **most likely**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[TURNING **UNCERTAINTY** INTO **RISK**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Probabilistic forecasting]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the second element
of the duo --- tries to [[address]{.mark} that
**[shortcoming]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Forecasters see scenario
planning as]{.underline} maddeningly vague or, worse, [dangerously
misleading]{.underline}. They not only point to the lack of consistent
evidence to support the alleged benefits of scenario planning; they also
argue that the compelling nature of a good story can trigger a host of
biases. Such biases fuel irrationality, in part by tricking
decision-makers into making basic statistical errors. For example, even
though a detailed narrative may seem more plausible than a sparse one,
every contingent event decreases the likelihood that a given scenario
will actually transpire. Nevertheless, people frequently confuse
plausibility for probability, assigning greater likelihood to specific
stories that have the ring of truth. They might, illogically, consider a
war with China triggered by a clash in the Taiwan Strait more likely
than a war with China triggered by any possible cause.

In contrast to scenario planning's emphasis on imagination, forecasting
tends to rely on calculation. Deductive approaches use models or laws
that describe the behavior of a system to predict its future state, much
like Newtonian mechanics allows astronomers to anticipate the position
of the planets. Inductive approaches do not require such understanding,
merely enough data and the assumption that the future will in some way
reflect the past. This is how Netflix anticipates what you might like to
watch or Amazon what you might want to buy, based purely on your
previous actions. Increasingly, thanks to advances in artificial
intelligence and machine learning, analysts use hybrid approaches.
Meteorology is a good example, in which researchers combine
sophisticated models and big data collection, which feed into each other
and enable ever-better weather forecasts.

International politics poses a challenge for these methods because the
laws governing the system are elusive or highly debatable, relevant data
points are often unavailable or unprecedented, and thousands of
variables interact in countless ways. History functions as a series of
unfolding events, with highly contingent branching paths sometimes
separated by mere happenstance. Tectonic shifts can hinge on seemingly
mundane occurrences. That makes it hard to deduce future events from
theoretical principles or to induce them from past experience.

As a result, historians and foreign policy experts are often bad
forecasters. In 2005, one of us, Philip Tetlock, published a study
demonstrating that seasoned political experts had trouble outperforming
"dart-tossing chimpanzees" --- random guesses --- when it came to
predicting global events. The experts fared even worse against amateur
news junkies. Overconfidence was the norm, not the exception. When
experts expressed 100 percent certainty that events would occur, those
events materialized only 80 percent of the time. Yet there were pockets
of excellence amid this unimpressive performance. Those who were surest
that they understood the forces driving the political system
("hedgehogs," in the philosopher Isaiah Berlin's terminology) fared
significantly worse than their humbler colleagues, who did not shy from
complexity, approaching problems with greater curiosity and
open-mindedness ("foxes").

This distinction caught the eye of the Intelligence Advanced Research
Projects Activity, which set up a geopolitical "forecasting tournament,"
in which Tetlock participated. He recruited a team of volunteers to
provide probabilistic answers to sharply defined questions, such as
"Will the euro fall below \$1.20 in the next year?" or "Will the
president of Tunisia flee to exile in the next six months?" By measuring
the difference between estimates and the actual occurrence of events,
Tetlock and his colleagues could calculate a score showing how
"well-calibrated" the expectations of any given forecaster were with
reality. By analyzing these data, Tetlock discovered that the [[key to
more accurate **geopolitical forecasting** was]{.mark} to take
people]{.underline} who were [naturally **numerate** and
**open-minded**]{.underline}, [train them [to think
**probabilistically**]{.mark}]{.underline} and avoid common biases, and
then group them so they could leverage the "wisdom of the crowd." The
**[[best forecasters]{.underline}]{.mark}** would
[[approach]{.underline}]{.mark} seemingly intractable [[questions by
decomposing them]{.underline}]{.mark} into parts, researching the past
frequency of similar (if not precisely analogous) events, adjusting the
odds based the uniqueness of the situation, and continually updating
their estimates as new information emerged. By the end of the
tournament, Tetlock's top performers had achieved scores that were 30
percent better than those of career CIA analysts with access to
classified information. Somehow, they had [[transmuted **uncertainty**
into **measurable risk**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The advantages of being able to put realistic odds on possible futures
are obvious. It gives you a peek into the future. But even the best
forecasters have their limits. If asked to predict events three to five
years out, their performance becomes increasingly indistinguishable from
random guessing. Still, many [[**critical policy questions** are **short
term**]{.underline}]{.mark}: perhaps the most famous recent example
concerned whether Osama bin Laden was in the Abbottabad compound in May
2011. Highly consequential short-term questions now include when a
COVID-19 vaccine will be widely available. As of this writing, the smart
money (68 percent probability) is on or before March 31, 2021.

But to the extent that leaders need to make consequential,
difficult-to-reverse decisions that will play out over the long run ---
the strategic choices that will give the United States an advantage over
time --- it becomes more difficult to link forecasts to policymaking.
Well-calibrated forecasters, for instance, can estimate the likelihood
that a skirmish with the Chinese navy in the South China Sea will result
in at least two American deaths by December 31. But what policymakers
really want to know is the extent to which China will threaten U.S.
interests in the coming years and decades.

Answers to that type of inquiry are beyond the reach of forecasters
because it is impossible to define precisely what constitutes an
interest or a threat. To provide forecasts, questions must pass the
"clairvoyance test," which is to say that were it possible to pose the
question to a genuine clairvoyant, that omniscient seer must be able to
answer it without having to ask for clarification. "Will I fall in
love?" is not a forecasting question. "Will I marry Jane Smith by this
time next year?" is.

From a policy perspective, then, the greatest challenge to forecasts is
that although they can clarify slices of the future, they do not
necessarily provide enough information to inform decision-making.
Indeed, making a decision based on one specific forecast would be a
mistake: the estimated probability of an event is a poor proxy for the
significance of that event. "Will Vladimir Putin relinquish power within
the next two years?" is a far different question from "What would
Vladimir Putin's abdication of power mean for U.S.-Russian relations?"
The problem with forecasting is thus the exact opposite of the problem
with scenarios: if the latter often provide too panoramic a view of the
future to be useful, the former provides too narrow a glimpse.

AN ANSWER FOR THE FUTURE

How should these different approaches to anticipating the future be
linked? The answer lies in developing clusters of questions that give
early, forecastable indications of which envisioned future is likely to
emerge, thus allowing policymakers to place smarter bets sooner. Instead
of evaluating the likelihood of a long-term scenario as a whole,
question clusters allow analysts to break down potential futures into a
series of clear and forecastable signposts that are observable in the
short run. Questions should be chosen not only for their individual
diagnostic value but also for their diversity as a set, so that each
cluster provides the greatest amount of information about which imagined
future is emerging --- or which elements of which envisioned futures are
emerging. As a result, the seductiveness of a particular narrative will
not tempt decision-makers into mistaking plausibility for probability.
Instead, preliminary answers to specific questions can provide a simple
metric for judging in advance how the future is most likely to unfold
--- a metric that analysts can then refine once the event in question
takes place or not.

Consider the scenarios RAND produced as part of its analysis of China's
grand strategy. The four scenarios envisioned for 2050 --- "Triumphant
China," "Ascendant China," "Stagnant China," and "Imploding China" ---
can be roughly placed on a classic two-by-two matrix, with the strength
of China's political leadership on one axis and the strength of China's
economy on the other. A cluster of questions that would give a heads-up
that history is on a "Triumphant China" trajectory might include "On
December 31, 2020, will China exercise de facto control over Itu Aba (or
Taiping Island) in the South China Sea (which is currently under the de
facto control of Taiwan)?" "Will China's GDP growth in 2023 exceed ten
percent?" and "Among African audiences, when will the China Global
Television Network have a higher weekly viewership than Voice of
America?"

These questions are useful both individually and collectively. Knowing
that top forecasters see an increased chance of China controlling the
island (from, say, a ten percent probability to a 20 percent
probability), for instance, would provide immediate tactical value to
the U.S. Navy. It should not necessarily tip the balance in the debate
over whether China will be "triumphant," but if all the forecasts
resulting from the question cluster are trending in the same direction,
the United States may want to recalibrate its strategy. As forecasts
change and individual questions are answered by the course of events,
the view of the far-off future becomes a little bit clearer. Analysts
can then update their scenarios and generate new clusters of questions.
They can thus develop a continually evolving sense of plausible futures,
as well as a probabilistic estimate of which policies will yield the
most bang for the buck today.

This method resembles the U.S. defense and intelligence community's use
of indications and warnings. In the early 1960s, for example, the
National Intelligence Council developed a list of actions --- large
troop maneuvers, for instance --- that might precede an attack by the
Sino-Soviet bloc. The idea was that tactical changes might provide an
early warning of future strategic shifts. Indications and warnings have
come to play an important role in many national security scenarios.
Unfortunately, there are potential problems with scouring today's
environment for hints of tomorrow. For one thing, as psychological
research shows, having envisioned a particular scenario, humans are not
only inclined to consider it more likely; they are also more prone to
see evidence of its emergence---a form of confirmation bias that U.S.
intelligence has battled for decades. For another, analysts are not
particularly good at discerning in real time which events matter---which
signposts are actually indicative of a particular future. Developments
initially considered to be earthshattering may turn out to be
significantly less important, whereas a story buried well beneath the
day's headlines can end up changing the course of history. In a
statistical analysis of nearly two million State Department cables sent
in the 1970s, for instance, one recent study demonstrated that U.S.
diplomats were often bad at estimating the historical importance of
contemporaneous events.

[[Linking scenarios to]{.underline}]{.mark} clusters of [forecasting
[questions mitigates]{.mark} these [problems]{.mark}]{.underline}.
First, because the questions must be precise enough to pass the
clairvoyance test, there is no wiggle room about what constitutes, say,
large troop maneuvers. Second, because questions that disprove
hypotheses often yield the greatest information, selecting questions for
their diagnostic value [[decreases]{.mark} forecasters' susceptibility
to **[confirmation bias]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Third, much as
diversified stock portfolios spread risk through multiple, uncorrelated
investments, the diversity of question clusters
[[prevents]{.underline}]{.mark} forecasters from [[overweighting]{.mark}
a [potentially **unimportant signpost** and **mistakenly
concluding**]{.mark}]{.underline} that a [particular scenario is coming
to pass]{.underline}. Finally, and most important, because [[question
clusters yield]{.mark} forecasts]{.underline}, [one can attach
[**meaningful probabilities** to]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[likelihood]{.mark} that [**particular events** will occur]{.mark} in
the future]{.underline}. This [provides]{.underline} a sort of advance
[**e**arly **w**arning **s**ystem]{.underline}. An event does not need
to actually transpire for the United States to have actionable
information. That, more than anything else, gives question clusters an
advantage over traditional indications and warnings.

PLANNING IN PRACTICE

To be useful, any vision of the future must be connected to decisions in
the present. Scholars and practitioners often claim that [[scenario
planning and probabilistic forecasting]{.underline}]{.mark} are
incompatible given their different assumptions and goals. In fact, they
[[mesh]{.mark} well]{.underline}. A scenario planner's conviction that
the future is uncertain need not clash with a forecaster's quest to
translate uncertainty into risk. Rather, the challenge lies in
understanding the limits of each method. Question clusters [make it
possible [to leverage]{.mark} the [strength of **each
approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[transforming]{.mark} the [**abstract
long term** into]{.mark} the [**concrete short term**
so]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} can
[[understand the future **quickly** and act to **stave off
danger**]{.underline}]{.mark}, seize opportunity, and strengthen
national security.

The [[greatest barrier]{.mark} to]{.underline} a [**clearer vision** of
the future [is not **philosophical** but
**organizational**]{.mark}]{.underline}: the [[potential]{.mark} of
combining scenario planning with probabilistic forecasting [means
**nothing** if it is not **implemented**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On
occasion, the intelligence community has used forecasting tournaments to
inform its estimates, but that is only a first step.
[[Policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark} and consumers of intelligence are
the ones who [[must]{.mark} understand]{.underline} the [importance of
forecasts and [**incorporate them** into]{.mark} their
[decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Too often, operational demands --- the
daily business of organizations, from weighty decisions to the mundane
--- fix attention on the current moment.

[[Overcoming]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[tyranny of the present
requires]{.mark} **high-level action** and broad]{.underline},
[[sustained effort]{.underline}]{.mark}. Leaders across the U.S.
government must cultivate the cognitive habits of top forecasters
throughout their organizations, while also institutionalizing the
imaginative processes of scenario planners. The country's prosperity,
its [[security]{.underline}]{.mark}, and, [ultimately]{.underline}, its
power all [[depend on policymakers' ability to envision **long-term
futures**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[anticipate **short-term
developments**]{.underline}, [and use]{.underline}]{.mark} [both
[**projections** to inform everything]{.mark}]{.underline} from the
budget to grand strategy. Giving the future short shrift only
shortchanges the United States.

"Naughty by NATO," September 2019, *The Baffler* 47\]

The "crises" created by the neoliberal flavored military-foreign policy
establishment will not always be so easy to answer correctly.
[[Imagine]{.mark} that [a **hypothetical**]{.mark} perfect [**leftist**
finds]{.mark} his or her way into [the White House]{.mark}. He or she
will obviously be smart enough not to start stupid wars as
stunts.]{.underline} But [[what]{.underline}]{.mark} happens
[[if]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark} or his
successors [seek to **bolster their**]{.mark} **domestic [standing by
invading the Baltic]{.mark}**]{.underline}
State**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**---Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia---to
reclaim them as former parts of the USSR? [**[What if]{.mark}** another
country, say China or [**Russia**, uses non-state actors]{.mark} as a
proxy [to]{.mark} launch a coordinated [attack]{.mark} via the internet
on critical U.S. [infrastructure? "**LOL aren't you glad I'm not a
warmongering neocon!" isn't**]{.mark} **going to cut it as [a
response]{.mark}**]{.underline}, despite being a true statement. And the
weird idea of **[[a far left]{.mark}-far right
[coalition]{.mark}]{.underline}**---exemplified by Tulsi Gabbard, the
"leftist" candidate every right-winger loves for not-at-all suspicious
reasons---**[[arguing that avoiding conflict with]{.mark} a country like
[Russia is best achieved by doing whatever Russia wants]{.mark}
is]{.underline}**, let us just say, **[not viable]{.underline}**.

What is the appropriate response? Right now, it is impossible to say
what the position of the American left would be in this situation,
because [its foreign policy is ambiguous and situational. The gut
reaction of anti-interventionism has appeal.]{.underline} So too does
the argument that if [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should
not]{.mark} be **[overrun]{.mark}ning small and relatively [defenseless
countries]{.mark}**, then [neither should other]{.mark} military
[powers]{.mark}.]{.underline} There will be situations, no matter how
much they would better be avoided, in which a hypothetical Congress or
White House occupied by a true leftist would need to react to events
beyond his or her control.

Alternatives to That

What would that look like? [What]{.underline}, in short, [is left
foreign policy]{.underline}? Michael Walzer, in his commendable A
Foreign Policy for the Left (2018), is among the few people who have
seriously taken on that question in a practical (as opposed to strictly
academic) context. He gets right the fundamental formulation: left
foreign policy should and must flow naturally from the core values of
the left.

In modern American politics, "defense" and "foreign policy" are
sometimes treated as interchangeable concepts; that's bad[. A basic
first principle for left foreign policy could be a return to the wider,
traditional conception of foreign policy as a toolkit]{.underline}.
Foreign aid, economic agreements, traditional diplomacy, combatting
inequality and violent extremism (including domestically, of course),
and **[[coop]{.mark}eration with international organizations [to
address]{.mark} truly [global issues would]{.mark} all combine to [offer
more]{.mark} potential [than]{.mark} the [current]{.mark}]{.underline}**
bipartisan stance that **[foreign [policy]{.mark}]{.underline}** is best
reduced to "We will bomb the shit out of you or not. Pick one."

A second core principle would be a real commitment to the thing American
foreign policy has paid condescending lip service to for decades: **[the
promotion of democratic institutions in other countries]{.underline}**.
This must obviously stop short of direct intervention in the domestic
affairs of other nations, and [will only be plausible once the United
States deals with its own panoply of problems with voter suppression,
felon disenfranchisement, and other anti-democratic
practices]{.underline}.

A third and more nebulous step must be to define, in accordance with the
left's core values, the "national interest" of the United States. It is
simple enough to say that America must protect "its interests" but much
harder to articulate what those interests are beyond "anything Congress
and the president feel like it is at a given moment." [If the promotion
of economic, gender, LGBTQ+, and racial equality were made a political
priority at home and abroad, the considerable economic power of the
United States could be a game-changer]{.underline}. That will require,
of course, a ground-up rethinking of unregulated free markets as the
basis for all American values and practices. Fortunately the left is
already pretty good at proposing alternatives to that.

Finally and perhaps most obviously, [the nation must shift decisively
away from relying so heavily on military hegemony to advance its
interests]{.underline}. [[Any leftist]{.mark} worth his or her salt
[can]{.mark} tell you that **[reduc]{.mark}ing the
bloated,**]{.underline} economically crippling **[[defense
spending]{.underline}]{.mark}** that is a cornerstone of Washington
consensus politics [is a first step.]{.underline} To implement such
changes will require the same kind of thoroughness and attention to
detail that the left has applied to domestic issues like Medicare for
All. Exactly what will be cut? Why? How will whatever function that
spending performed (if any) be replaced by a more effective form of
foreign policy?

[Articulating a well-developed foreign policy worldview will be aided by
moving beyond today's limited foreign policy
conceptions]{.underline}---to shift the paradigms, to put it in the most
annoying possible terms. Left ideas are usually shoehorned into
easy-to-digest categories like "pacifism" or "isolationism." As the
right has proven repeatedly, **[coming up with better language with
which to communicate ideas to voters will be essentia]{.underline}**l.

HyperSimplification

Look, I don't have all of the answers, and to be frank and crass, if I
did I would not likely give them away to the world for The Baffler's
going rate for freelance contributions. I am certain, though, that the
current state of left foreign policy is a void that needs to be filled
with something other than the Wikileaks Bro politics, perhaps best
exemplified by the phenomenon that is Tulsi Gabbard, of apologias for
authoritarian nationalist leaders around the world. It is not enough to
identify the obvious flaws in liberal foreign policy, with its
convoluted hawkishness and rebranded military-centered consensus
worldview, and simply conclude that the polar opposite must be the best
course.

Criticizing Hillary Clinton's (or now Joe Biden's) campaign for its
terrible foreign policy stances is the low-hanging fruit. Looking inward
and reflecting on the core goals and values of left politics---rejecting
the allure of Tucker Carlson-approved ideas like "Hey, isn't being
friends with Putin a good thing?"---will be the more challenging part[.
For over a century the United States has been a global Bad
Actor]{.underline}, and it is imperative that it interact differently
with the world. But **[pretending that it alone is a Bad
Actor]{.underline}**, [and the intentions of every other nation will
become honorable as the United States renounces its sinful ways, **is
dumb**.]{.underline}

**[[Foreign policy]{.underline}]{.mark}** is not merely a set of
choices; it also **[[requires responding to]{.mark} events [other
actors]{.mark} initiate]{.underline}**. [This is where modern left views
come up shortest. Non-interventionism is intellectually appealing not
only because it fixes many of the current evils and ills of U.S. foreign
policy]{.underline}---Hey, let's stop starting wars!---but because it
reduces everything to one simple answer. [There is no need to learn
about the Spratly Islands dispute among China and its
neighbors]{.underline}, [**[oppression of]{.mark} the
[Uyghurs]{.mark}**[, **Donbas**, **Syria**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the
multi-sided civil war in Yemen, and other current points of
tension]{.underline}. [Like the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s]{.underline},
**[[confusing]{.mark} foreign [conflicts that do not conform to]{.mark}
the narrative of one [good]{.mark} guy fighting one [bad]{.mark} guy are
difficult for our political system to process]{.underline}**. [The urge
to oversimplify or ignore these conflicts]{.underline}, [especially when
they are]{.underline} distant and **[not perceived as directly relevant
to Americans, is strong]{.underline}**.

[Vestigial organs]{.underline} of the Cold War world order [like [NATO
could]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with a better underlying set of values,
**[be useful]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[tools [toward promoting left
foreign policy goals]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is not to assert that
it will, as America's role in NATO is only as good as the domestic
politics driving it. **[[Collective agreements]{.mark} can be a useful
alternative to]{.underline}**, for example, **[multi-trillion-dollar
domestic defense spending]{.underline}**. America's **[military
alliances [are not inherently bad]{.mark}]{.underline}**; the
[choices]{.underline} our [elected officials make are the
problem]{.underline}. [Growing its foothold in domestic politics will be
easier when the left can advance a coherent foreign policy
worldview]{.underline} that communicates what it intends to do rather
than only what it will not do.

### Stop RUS Imperialism!

#### Russia is a petro-autocracy that [must]{.underline} be stopped. Ukraine is exhibit #1 in Russia's [ruthless]{.underline} imperialism.

Jesse **Harasta 6-23**-2022. Associate Professor of International
Studies, Ph.D. in Cultural Anthropology. \"Wars for Oil, Wars by Oil:
Understanding Petro-Autocracy and the 'New' Imperialism\". Journal of
the Research Group on Socialism and Democracy 31(1).
https://doi.org/10.1080/08854300.2021.2076045. DL

In many ways [the Russian Federation is the **most powerful** and
**archetypal petro-autocracy**]{.underline}. [[Russian **imperial
designs**]{.mark} on its neighbors [are]{.mark}]{.underline}, of course,
**[[not]{.mark}hing [new]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Even [during]{.mark}
the **relatively [liberal Yeltsin]{.mark}** Presidency]{.underline}
(1991--1999), [[Russia intervened in]{.underline}]{.mark} conflicts in
[**[Georgia]{.mark}**, **[Moldova]{.mark}**, and **[Tajikistan]{.mark}**
and waged war internally against peripheral regions of the Russian
Federation in **[Chechnya]{.mark}**, **[Dagestan]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark}
**North [Ossetia]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

However, [the **[Putin]{.mark} Regime**]{.underline} (2000--Present)
[[opened]{.mark} a **new, fundamentally [aggressive]{.mark}** strain of
the Russian [imperialism]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The assault upon the
Chechen city of [Grozny]{.mark}, [an]{.mark} **[abomination]{.mark}** of
a siege that involved a **month-long**]{.underline} [bombardment
[resulting in the]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}**[city's
[annihilation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[was]{.mark} among
[Putin's]{.mark} **very [first acts]{.mark}** [in office and set a **new
tone**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[for]{.mark} **ruthlessness** and
**[brutality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. After this victory, the autocracy
took several years to solidify its control over domestic politics.53

[The first major international conflict]{.underline} that [Putin's
autocracy engaged in was the **2008** Russian--Georgian War]{.underline}
which, while a Russian victory, revealed structural weaknesses in the
Russian military. [This led to a **massive reform** of the military
which culminated in the first invasion of]{.underline} the [Ukraine in
**2014**]{.underline}, which marks -- for our purposes -- the point
where the Russian Federation had completed its transformation into an
imperialist petro-autocracy.54 [Since 2014, Russia's imperialist
aggressions have had a **particular focus**]{.underline}
[on]{.underline} the [Ukraine]{.underline}.

Much has been made both in Russia and abroad of Russian security
concerns regarding the [expansion of [NATO]{.mark} and Ukrainian
neutrality]{.underline}, and no doubt these
[[factor]{.underline}]{.mark} highly [[into]{.mark} [Russian
calculations but cannot **explain them**]{.mark}
**entirely**]{.underline}. [[NATO **already borders**]{.underline}
[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the Baltic [and]{.mark} what triggered
[the first]{.mark} wave of imperialist [attack was **not**]{.mark} a
**[security]{.mark} threat**]{.underline}, [[but]{.mark} a crisis
triggered by [Ukrainian **economic reorientation**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[from Russia [to]{.mark} [the EU.]{.mark} It was the potential of
Ukraine joining the]{.underline} **[Western economic]{.underline}**,
**[not military]{.underline}**, [bloc, that started the chain of
events]{.underline} of 2014. This does not preclude the Russians seeking
to strengthen their military position: for instance, early in the war,
the Russian navy seized Snake Island in the Black Sea with a
particularly famous exchange with the defenders.55 The propaganda value
of the defenders' defiance has overshadowed the strategic blow of the
island's loss: Russia now controls access not only to the Ukrainian
western port cities but also the mouth of the Danube River.56

That said, ultimately, [Ukraine is as important to Russian **economic
imperialism** as it is to Russian **military power**]{.underline} --
[only that to admit it would require that the Russian Federation
recognize its own **imperial ambitions**.]{.underline} Likewise for the
West to state that Ukraine would become an economic adjunct and captive
market to Russian manufacturers would invite discussions of how it would
fulfill a similar role for German and Central European firms in the EU.
Accusing Russia of this activity would potentially open up the West to
the same accusations towards its own exploitative relationships with
peripheral nations -- gone is the time when Western diplomats could
recognize that: "It cannot be stressed enough that without Ukraine,
Russia ceases to be an empire, but with Ukraine suborned and then
subordinated, Russia automatically becomes an empire."57

At the heart of any putative transition from semi-periphery to core is a
diversification and expansion of economic activities, including
specialized manufacturing for export to the periphery. [Russia's
manufacturing sector is large but is almost entirely **consumed
domestically**]{.underline}.58 Exceptions to this would include
dependent satrapies in the former USSR "near abroad" such as Belarus.
Russian exports to Belarus are far more diverse than its exports in
general. [**Over half** of Russia's global exports are in **mineral
products**, especially **oil** and **natural gas**.]{.underline} Other
major exports are generally raw materials, such as gold (5.19% of
exports), wheat (2.44%), sawn wood (1.3%) and raw aluminum (1.34%).59
The Russian manufacturing and automotive sectors are negligible elements
of their exports except to dependent nations like Belarus, where
automobiles make up a respectable 3.21% of exports.60 Kazakhstan, a
similarly dependent economy, also imports a significant amount of
manufactured goods from Russia and a diverse number of products.61 In
comparison, other major trading partners like Germany and China
overwhelmingly import oil (63.75% of exports to China and 61.3% to
Germany).62

[It makes sense]{.underline}, therefore, [if the Russian state seeks to
renegotiate its global position from the **semi-periphery** into the
**core of global** nations, it needs to **diversify its economy** and
strengthen its **manufacturing base**]{.underline}. This can be done by
increasing domestic consumption or increasing exports. [Domestic
consumption can be increased]{.underline} through increasing the
percentage of locally produced goods consumed by Russians or [by
**increasing** the **number of Russians**.]{.underline}
Import-substitution policies in the face of external sanctions aim to
increase domestic consumption but [the **conquest and annexation** of
new territories into the Russian Federation is the **quickest way** to
increase the Russian population]{.underline} (tactics to encourage
natural population growth have had marginal success in Russia and are
expensive for the state).63 [Increasing **global exports**]{.underline}
-- [outside of energy and raw materials]{.underline} --
[has]{.underline} also [not been successful, and it is an logical move
within an **imperialist framework** to resolve this through the creation
of new **dependent territories**.]{.underline}

The [Ukraine]{.underline}, with its population of over 44 million, [is
the only significant territory bordering Russia, apart from China, that
is **not yet integrated** into its system or the EU/NATO system and it
makes sense that]{.underline} the [Russians would **seek to expand**
here]{.underline}. [[A successful]{.mark} [imperial project that
annexes]{.mark} large areas of]{.underline} the
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} and creates a dependent state(s) in the
remainder [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [[be]{.mark} a
long-term **[economic boon]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for Russian
manufacturing]{.underline}.

[[It would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[give Russia]{.mark} a
[stranglehold over]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[wheat]{.underline}]{.mark}** export market. In 2021, [Russia
exported 17.7 percent of the world's wheat and Ukraine a further 8
percent]{.underline}.64 [In]{.underline} the Middle East-North Africa
([MENA]{.underline}) nations, [where Russian foreign policy has been
**deeply involved**]{.underline} in the last decade, [Russian and
Ukrainian wheat make up 85 percent of]{.underline} the [imports
for]{.underline} both [Turkey and Egypt and]{.underline} perhaps [60
percent of Tunisian imports]{.underline}.65 [The entire region is
heavily dependent on wheat]{.underline} prices [and [Russian
control]{.mark} over the Ukrainian market would [give]{.mark} the
Russian Federation **strong [leverage]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[over]{.mark} its historic rival, **[Turkey]{.mark}**, and countries
**throughout the region**.]{.underline}

In the aftermath of the 2014 invasion of Crimea and the Donbas, Russia
faced crippling economic sanctions from the West and the federal
government began a process of "Sanctions-proofing" the country,
apparently in preparation for the 2022 war.66

One key tool was the accumulation of foreign currency and gold reserves.
The Russian state drew heavily upon reserves to prop up its economy
after the 2014 sanctions but then, by 2019, had recuperated those
expenditures and greatly exceeded them.67 By the outset of the 2022 war,
they had reached unprecedented highs of over \$600 billion.68 Without
the income from oil and gas sales, these gold and currency purchases
would have been simply impossible. The Russians are not the first
petro-autocracy to hoard gold as a check against foreign intervention.
The Libyans under Col. Muammar Gaddafi had approximately \$6.5 billion
in gold in 2011 that they used to pay mercenaries after being sanctioned
out of the banking system.69

The Russians also constructed the SPFS, an alternative system of
electronic banking payments, in preparation for cut-off form the US-led
SWIFT system; they also worked with China to attempt to harmonize SPFS
with the Chinese CBIBPS system.70 This was part of a broader strategy of
withdrawing from reliance on foreign capital and banking services and an
aggressive import substitution subsidy system.

[While Russia's [invasion of Ukraine]{.mark} **was a
break**]{.underline} [from the norms of post-Cold War international
relations,]{.underline} it was hardly an example of Putin's supposed
insanity -- instead [it [was]{.mark} **carefully [planned]{.mark}**-for
[and consistent with **inherent cruelty**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of
Russia's imperial objectives.]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[Crucially]{.underline}**, [it was an act that would have **been
impossible** without the phenomenal]{.underline}
**[petro-wealth]{.underline}** [flowing into Russia or the **autocratic
system** built **upon that wealth**.]{.underline}

#### Their [criticism]{.underline} of NATO and the West is [imperialism]{.underline} that muddles Russia's inordinate role in its invasion of Ukraine, justifying the war. [Reject]{.underline} their [US-centric]{.underline} explanation.

[[In the]{.underline}]{.mark} immediate [[aftermath of]{.mark}
Russia's]{.underline} 2022 [invasion of]{.underline} the
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, [even those]{.underline} American
[[Left]{.mark} groups that condemned the invasion]{.underline} typically
[coupled their critiques with a **[condemn]{.mark}ation** of [NATO's
expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, on February 26th, the
Democratic Socialists of America71 -- the USA's largest socialist
organization -- released a statement condemning the Russian attack, but
did not use the term "imperialism" to describe it, reserving that term
for the USA and NATO. They opened their last paragraph with the line:

DSA reaffirms our call for the US to withdraw from NATO and to end the
imperialist expansionism that set the stage for this conflict.72

[[This **fundamentally** misunderstands the]{.mark} geopolitical
[situation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[dismantling]{.mark} of
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} and Western empire, while absolutely
necessary to achieve global liberation, [[is]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}** [an]{.underline}]{.mark} [[**immediate** tool for
the prevention of]{.mark} **petro-autocracy**
[imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even if NATO\'s threat to Russia in
Ukraine were to be removed]{.underline}, the [geostrategic **[economic
concerns]{.mark}**]{.underline} are like to remain sufficient to
[continue to **[fuel the war]{.mark}**]{.underline} ([[as evidenced by
the **war continuing**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[despite **Kiev's offers**
of]{.mark} **military [neutrality]{.mark}**]{.underline}) [so long as
victory **remains possible**.]{.underline}73 If we are to accept a
materialist understanding of social relations, [we must be conscious of
the **economics** involved in **imperial** expansion.]{.underline}
[**Socialist** and **Left** movements must **expand their definitions**
of imperialism to include the assaults of petro-autocracies upon their
neighbors]{.underline} and name them as such.

[[We cannot support a **dualistic understanding**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[of geopolitics [where]{.mark} "[imperialism]{.mark}" [is]{.mark}
[solely the]{.mark} province of [West]{.mark}ern core
states]{.underline} and primarily enacted through Wars for Oil
[[and]{.mark} where **[any resistance]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to the
West is]{.mark} **inherently [anti-imperial]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[liberatory]{.underline}** [in nature.]{.underline}
[This should not blunt our critiques of American]{.underline} military
[hegemony]{.underline} or the many tools used by the USA and other Core
states to dominate the peripheral regions of the Global South;
**[instead]{.underline}** [it can expand and sharpen our analysis and
opposition to imperialism in **all its forms**]{.underline}. This paper
aims to begin this process through identifying the general trends and
identifying examples that might be used to demarcate the varying forms
that petro-autocratic imperialism takes. This requires further work to
test hypotheses that emerge out of this preliminary analysis.

In a broader sense, this article's theorizing provokes questions of
praxis: [in situations of **non-US-centered** imperialism, [we **must
reconsider**]{.mark} what international [solidarity]{.mark} looks
like]{.underline}. If the American Left cannot help the Ukrainian
anti-imperial movement through changing US imperial policy (which has
been its ideological go-to since at least the Cuban Revolution), then
what can it do?

In the absence of our presence, [what remains of anti-imperial
international solidarity is likely]{.underline} to be the
often-[**conservative diaspora** politics]{.underline}. [It was
**exactly this** type of organizing by the **non-Left** Armenian
diaspora that allowed Armenia to **resist Azeri** attacks]{.underline}
to the extent it did, [to the point where frustrated Armenians declared
that "**we are alone**."]{.underline} 74 [Imagine if, instead of showing
up to rallies where they met only]{.underline} other [ethnic
Armenians]{.underline}, [they also found]{.underline} **[cadres of
socialists]{.underline}** [ready to **stand with them**]{.underline}
[and bearing an **anti-imperialist critique**]{.underline} of the
situation. In the words of the Azerbaijani anti-war youth:

We don't blame the people though: in the absence of alternative
interpretative frameworks to make sense of the war and the conflict
between the two nations, the nationalist ideology remains uncontested.
75

Future theorization might also focus on the ways that decarbonization
might be understood as as anti-imperial solidarity. If petro-autocracy
imperialism can be demonstrated to be a significant force
internationally, this could be a particularly fruitful area of analysis
and action.

In contrast, [[what will have]{.mark} **absolutely [no
impact]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on]{.mark} the [Ukraine]{.mark} War
[will be a **protest**]{.mark} **[against NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[in New York]{.underline} -- [if anything, [it will have the
**pro-imperial outcome**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[by]{.mark}
**ideologically [muddling]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[the political
discourse]{.mark} and diverting attention from the **imperial nature**
of the Russian assault.]{.underline} This does not mean that solidarity
protests cannot be useful, only that they cannot be our only tool and
they must name all of the imperial actors for what they are and condemn
them accordingly. [[The]{.mark} American [Left's]{.mark} own **cultural
[narcissism]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that]{.mark} **["our"
imperialism]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[must be **the only
target**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of our criticism [is]{.mark} **[itself a
product of an imperial imagination.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} American [Left has]{.mark} **largely
[neglected]{.mark}**]{.underline} [its responsibilities of
**[international solidarity]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and left its
anti-imperial solidarity obligations]{.underline} (ideological and
organizational) to the most sectarian of factions.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[lead to situations
where]{.underline}]{.mark} observers can claim that "[[the
Left]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[supports **Assad**]{.underline}]{.mark},76
**[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}**,77 [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**ian state.78 [[Leftists]{.mark} who
**would be [horrified]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to be associated [with

imperialism]{.underline} that [recognizes]{.underline} **[all

FH: He's going to try to make it as easy for himself as possible.
[Russia can keep on **terrorizing everybody** and **lobbing missiles**
all over the place]{.underline}. [\[It\] can keep on putting an
**embargo on grain** and making it very difficult. [Putin]{.mark}'s
assumption [is]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the Turks, the Lebanese, the
African Union, and everybody will start **putting pressure** on the
United States and the West because he's saying, "That's the result of
**their sanctions**." Which it isn't,]{.underline} of course---[it's him
[**deliberately manipulating** famine]{.mark} in Africa [to]{.mark} [put
us]{.mark} all in the **hot seat** [as the **bad guys**]{.mark} here.
[**Putin's game** is to have us **defeat
ourselves**]{.mark}]{.underline}, basically, because we can't imagine
being able to sustain this over several years.

FP: [A lot of]{.underline} [this sounds like **mind
games**.]{.underline} There's the well-known story from Putin's
childhood where a young Putin chased a rat around his family's apartment
building. He traps the rat in a corner, and then the rat lashes out at
him. [[Putin]{.mark}'s]{.underline} takeaway from that scenario was that
there's never a retreat; you have to fight to the bitter end. But that's
what he [[**wants us** to think]{.underline}]{.mark}, right? [That [if
we go too far, **he'll launch** World War III]{.mark}]{.underline}?

FH: Exactly. And the only documentation of that story is Vladimir Putin
telling his biographers about it.

FP: That's right.

FH: [Putin's been a **wartime president**]{.underline} [from the **very
beginning**]{.underline}. Look, we're already in World War III in terms
of this being an epoch-making conflict. [There's an **information
war**]{.underline}. [He's already **annexed territory**]{.underline}.
World War I wasn't a nuclear war, but there was the using of mustard gas
and chlorine. [Putin has already used **Novichok**, **polonium**, and
all kinds of other **chemical weapons**]{.underline}
[aiding]{.underline} and abetting \[Syrian President\] Bashar
al-**[Assad]{.underline}**.

We've been in this for a very long time. [[Putin takes us on]{.mark}
these **historical [magical]{.mark}**]{.underline} [mystery
**[tours]{.mark}** all the time [for
**justification**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Sometimes he blames
**NATO**]{.mark}. [Sometimes]{.mark} he blames [the]{.mark}
**[E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion**. And then he's always trying to
find the hot-button issues that]{.underline} he [can]{.underline} press
to **[scare people]{.underline}**. In 2019, at the G-20 in Osaka,
\[Japan\], in the last meeting that I sat in between Trump and Putin, he
already threatened Trump about invoking the idea of the euro missile
crisis of the 1980s over the U.S. pull out of the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces Treaty, basically saying, "If there are no treaties left
to underpin European security, what's going to happen then, Donald?" He
says, "Your European allies won't want to go back to the time of the
euro missile crisis." So, [[he's always been in]{.mark} the business of
[nuclear **saber-rattling**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### AT: Nuclear War Anti-Black

#### The argument that nuclear weapons don't affect communities is anti-black white washing. 

**Thompson '18** \[Nicole; April 4th; Creative Writer; RaceBaitR, "Why I
will not allow the fear of a nuclear attack to be white-washed,"
https://racebaitr.com/2018/04/06/2087/; GR\]

I couldn't spare empathy for a white woman whose biggest fear was
something that hadn't happened yet and might not. Meanwhile,
[[my]{.mark} most **significant [fears]{.mark}**
[were]{.mark}]{.underline} in motion: women and men [[dying in
**cells**]{.mark} after being **wrongly imprisoned**]{.underline},
choked out for peddling cigarettes, [[or **shot to
death**]{.underline}]{.mark} during 'routine' traffic stops. I twitch
when my partner is late, worried that a cantankerous cop has brutalized
or shot him because he wouldn't prostrate himself.

[[As a **woman of color**]{.underline}]{.mark}, I am aware of the
[multiple types of [violence]{.mark} that [threaten me
**currently**]{.mark}---[not **theoretically**. Street
harassment]{.mark}]{.underline}, excessively affecting me as a Black
woman, has blindsided me since I was eleven. A premature body
[[meant]{.underline}]{.mark} being catcalled before I'd discussed the
birds and the bees. It meant being followed, whistled at, or groped. As
an adult, while navigating through neighborhoods with extinguished
street lights, I noticed the correlation between women's safety and
street lighting---as well as the fact that Black and brown neighborhoods
were never as brightly lit as those with a more significant white
population.

I move quickly through those unlit spaces, never comforted by the
inevitable whirl of red and blue sirens. In fact, it's always been the
contrary. Ever so often, cops approach me in their vehicle's encouraging
me to "Hurry along," "Stay on the sidewalk," or "Have a good night." My
spine stiffening, I never believed they endorsed my safety. Instead, I
worried that I'd be accused of an unnamed accusation, corned by a cop
who preys on Black women, or worse. A majority of my 50-minute bus ride
from the southside of Chicago to the north to join these women for the
birthday celebration was spent reading articles about citywide
shootings. I began with a Chicago Tribute piece titled "33 people shot,
seven fatally, in 13 hours," then toppled into a barrage of RIP posts on
Facebook and ended with angry posts about police brutality on Tumblr.
You might guess, by the time I arrived to dinner I wasn't in the mood
for the "I can't believe we're all going to die because Trump is an
idiot" shit.

I shook my head, willing the meal to be over, and was grateful when the
check arrived just as someone was asking me about my hair. My thinking
wasn't all too different from Michael Harriot's 'Why Black America Isn't
Worried About the Upcoming Nuclear Holocaust." While the meal was partly
pleasant, I departed [[thinking, "fear of **nuclear**]{.mark}
**demolitio[n]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} just **some [white
shit]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

Sadly, that thought would not last long.

I still vibe with Harriot's statement, "Black people have lived under
the specter of having our existence erased on a white man's whim since
we stepped onto the shore at Jamestown Landing."
[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, a friend---a Black friend---ignited my
nuclear paranoia by sharing theories about when it might happen and who
faced the greatest threat. In an attempt to ease my friend's fear, I
leaned in to listen but accidentally toppled down the rabbit hole too. I
forked through curated news feeds. I sifted through "fake news," "actual
news," and foreign news sources. Suddenly, an idea took root: [**nuclear
[strike]{.mark}** [would]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**disproportionately**
impact **Black** ]{.mark}**people**, **[brown]{.mark} people**, [and
**low-income**]{.mark} **individuals**]{.underline}.

North Korea won't target the plain sight racists of Portland, Oregon,
the violently microaggressive liberals of the rural Northwest, or the
white-hooded klansmen of Diamondhead, Mississippi. No, under the
instruction of the supreme leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea will likely
strike densely populated urban areas, such as Los Angeles, Chicago,
Washington D.C., and New York City. These locations stand-out as targets
for a nuclear strike because they are densely populated U.S. population
centers. [[Attacking]{.underline}]{.mark} the heart of the nation or
**[populous [cities]{.mark}]{.underline}** [would [translate to]{.mark}
**more [casualties]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With that in mind, it's not
lost on me that the most [**populous [cities]{.mark}** [in the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [boast
sizeable]{.mark}]{.underline} diverse populations, or more plainly put:
**[[Black populations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This stresses me out!
There's a creeping chill that follows me, a silent alarm that rings each
time my Google alert chimes letting me know that Donald Trump has yet
again provoked Kim Jong-Un, a man who allegedly killed his very own
uncle. I've grown so pressed by the idea of nuclear holocaust that my
partner and I started gathering non-perishables, candlesticks, a
hand-crank radio, and other must-buy items that can be banked in a
shopping cart. The practice of preparing for a nuclear holocaust strike
sometimes feels comical, particularly when acknowledging that there has
long been a war on Black people in this country.

Blackness is bittersweet in flavor. We are blessed with the melanized
skin, the MacGyver-like inventiveness of our foremothers, and our
blinding brightness---but the anti-blackness that we experience is also
blinding as well as stifling. We are stuck by rigged systems, punished
with the prison industrial complex, housing discrimination, pay
discrimination, and worse. We get side-eyes from strangers when we're
"loitering," and the police will pull us over for driving "too fast" in
a residential neighborhood. We get murdered for holding cell phones
while standing in our grandmother's backyard.

The racism that strung up our ancestors, kept them sequestered to the
back of the bus and kept them in separate and unequal schools still
lives. It lives, and it's more palpable than dormant. To me, this means
one thing: Trump's America isn't an unfortunate circumstance, it's a
homecoming event that's hundreds of years in the making, no matter how
many times my white friends' say, "He's not my president."

In light of this homecoming, [[we]{.mark} **now [flirt]{.mark}** [with
a]{.mark} **new, [larger]{.mark}** fear]{.underline} of a [**Black
[genocide]{.mark}**[. America has]{.mark} **always [worked]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark}wards **Black [eradication]{.mark}**
[through]{.mark}]{.underline} a steady stream of [**life-threatening
[inequality]{.mark}**[, but **nuclear war**]{.mark}]{.underline} on
American soil [would be **[swift]{.underline}**]{.mark}. And for this
reason I've grown tired of whiteness being at the center of the nuclear
conversation. The race-neutral approach to the dialogue, and a tendency
to continue to promote the idea that missiles will land in suburban and
rural backyards, instead of inner-city playgrounds, is false.

"The Day After," the iconic, highest-rated television film in history,
aired November 20, 1983. More than 100 million people tuned in to watch
a film postulating a war between the Soviet Union and the United States.
The film, which would go on to affect President Ronald Reagan and
policymakers' nuclear intentions, shows the "true effects of nuclear war
on average American citizens." The Soviet-targeted areas featured in the
film include Higginsville, Kansas City, Sedalia, Missouri, as well as El
Dorado Springs, Missouri. They depict the destruction of the central
United States, and viewers watch as full-scale nuclear war transforms
middle America into a burned wasteland. Yet unsurprisingly, the
[[devastation]{.underline}]{.mark} from the attack [[is]{.mark}
**completely [white-washed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, leaving out the more
likely victims which are the more densely populated (Black) areas.

**[[Death]{.mark} tolls]{.underline}** would be high for white
populations, yes, but large-scale losses of Black and brown folks would
outpace that number, due to placement and poverty. That number [[would
be]{.mark} **pushed [higher]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} **limited
[access]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} premium **[health
[care]{.mark}]{.underline}**, wealth, and resources. The [[effects
of]{.mark} **radiation [sickness]{.mark}**]{.underline}, burns,
compounded injuries, and malnutrition would throttle Black and brown
communities and [[would **mark us** for
**generations**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It's for that reason that we have
to do more to foster disaster preparedness among Black people where we
can. [[**Black people** deserve]{.mark} the [space to explore]{.mark}
**nuclear [unease]{.mark}**[, even if we have **competing
threats**]{.mark}]{.underline}, anxieties, and worries.

#### Anticipating nuclear extinction [breeds empathy]{.underline} and [entangled care]{.underline}. Distancing ourselves from considering extinction [reifies]{.underline} detached elitism.

**Offord, 17**---Faculty of Humanities, School of Humanities Research

ENTANGLEMENT," Angelaki, 22:3, 17-25, dml) \[ableist language

[You are steered towards **overwhelming** and **inexplicable pain**
[when you consider]{.mark} the **nuclear entanglement** that the
species]{.underline} Homo sapiens [finds itself in]{.underline}. This is
because [the fact of living in [the nuclear]{.mark} age presents an
**[existential]{.mark}**, **aesthetic**, **[ethical]{.mark}** and
**psychological [challenge]{.mark}** that defines human consciousness.
Although an **immanent threat** and **ever-present danger** to the
**very existence** of the human species, living with the possibility of
nuclear war has **infiltrated [the matrix of modernity]{.mark} so
profoundly** as to]{.underline} paralyse [\[**[shut down]{.mark}**\]
[our mind-set to respond]{.mark} adequately. [We have chosen to **ignore
the facts**]{.mark} at the heart of the nuclear program]{.underline}
with its dangerous algorithm; [we have chosen [to **live with the**
]{.mark}**capacity** and [**possibility** of]{.mark} a **collective**,
**pervasive** and even **[planetary-scale suicide]{.mark}**; and the
techno-industrial-national powers that claim there is "**no immediate
danger**" ad infinitum]{.underline}.8

This has led to one of the key logics of modernity\'s insanity. As
Harari writes: "Nuclear weapons have turned war between superpowers into
a mad act of collective suicide, and therefore forced the most powerful
nations on earth to find alternative and peaceful ways to resolve
conflicts."9 This is the nuclear algorithm at work, a methodology of
madness. In revisiting Jacques Derrida in "No Apocalypse, Not Now (Full
Speed Ahead, Seven Missiles, Seven Missives),"10 who described nuclear
war as a "non-event," it is clear that the pathology of the "non-event"
remains as active as ever even in the time of Donald Trump and Kim
Jong-un with their stichomythic nuclear posturing.

[[The question]{.mark} of our times [is whether we have]{.mark} an
**equal** or **more compelling [capacity]{.mark}** and **willingness**
[to **end this**]{.mark} **impoverished but ever-present
[logic]{.mark}** of pain and uncertainty. How not simply to **bring
about disarmament**, but to **go beyond** this politically
charged]{.underline}, as well as mythological and psychological
[**nuclear algorithm**?]{.underline} How to find love amidst the nuclear
entanglement; the antidote to this entanglement? Is it possible to end
the pathology of power that exists with nuclear capacity? Sadly, the
last lines of Nitin Sawhney\'s "Broken Skin" underscore this
entanglement:

Just 5 miles from India\'s nuclear test site

Children play in the shade of the village water tank

Here in the Rajasthan desert people say

They\'re proud their country showed their nuclear capability.11

As an activist scholar working in the fields of human rights and
cultural studies, [[responding]{.mark} to the nuclear algorithm [is an
**imperative**]{.mark}. Your **politics**, **ethics** and **scholarship
are indivisible** in this cause. An **acute [sense of care]{.mark} for
the world**, [informed by **pacifist** and **non-violent**,
**de-colonialist approaches**]{.mark} to knowledge and practice,
**[pervades your concern]{.mark}**. You are **aware** that there are
**other ways of knowing** than those you are familiar and credentialed
with]{.underline}. You are aware that you are complicit in the prisons
that you choose to live inside,12 and that there is no such thing as an
innocent bystander. [You [use]{.mark} your [scholarship to]{.mark}
**shake up the world**]{.underline} from its paralysis, abjection and
amnesia; [to **[unsettle]{.mark} the epistemic** and **structural
[violence]{.mark}** that is ubiquitous to neoliberalism and its
machinery; to **create dialogic** and **learning spaces** for the work
of critical human rights and critical justice to take place. All this,
and to **enable an ethics of intervention** through understanding what
is at the very heart of the]{.underline} critical human rights
[impulse]{.underline}, creating a "dialogue for being, because I am not
without the other."13

Furthermore, as a critical human rights advocate [living in a nuclear
armed world, your challenge is to **[reconceptualise the human
community]{.mark}**]{.underline} as Ashis Nandy has argued, [[to see how
we can learn to]{.mark} **co-exist with others in conviviality** and
also learn to **[co-survive]{.mark} with the non-human**, even to
**flourish**]{.underline}. A dialogue for being requires a leap into a
human rights frame that includes a deep ecological dimension, where [the
planet itself is **inherently involved as a participant** in its
future]{.underline}. This requires scholarship that "thinks like a
mountain."14 A critical human rights approach understands that it cannot
be simply human-centric. It requires a nuanced and arresting clarity to
present perspectives on co-existence and co-survival that are from human
and non-human viewpoints.15

Ultimately, [you realise that your [struggle]{.mark} is **not confined
to**]{.underline} declarations, treaties, [**legislation**, and **law**,
**though they have their role**. It must go further to [produce
"**creative intellectual exchange**]{.mark} [that]{.mark} might [release
**new ethical energies for** ]{.mark}**mutually assured
[survival]{.mark}**."]{.underline}16 [Taking [an **anti-nuclear
stance**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} **enabling a [post-nuclear
activism]{.mark}** demands a **revolution**]{.underline} within the
field of human rights work. [Recognising the **entanglement of
nuclearism**]{.underline} with the Anthropocene, for one thing,
[**[requires]{.mark} a profound [shift in focus]{.mark}** from the
**human-centric** to a **more-than-human co-survival**.]{.underline} It
also requires a fundamental shift in understanding our human culture, in
which the very epistemic and rational acts of sundering from co-survival
with the planet and environment takes place. [In the end, you
realise]{.underline}, as Raimon Panikkar has articulated, ["it is not
realistic to toil for peace if we do not proceed to a disarmament of the
bellicose culture in which we live."]{.underline}17 Or, as Geshe Lhakdor
suggests, there must be "inner disarmament for external disarmament."18
In this sense, it is within the cultural arena, our human society, where
the entanglement of subjective meaning making, nature and politics
occurs, that we need to disarm.

It is 1982, and you are reading Jonathan Schell\'s The Fate of the Earth
on a Sydney bus. Sleeping has not been easy over the past few nights as
you reluctantly but compulsively read about the consequences of nuclear
war. For some critics, Schell\'s account is high polemic, but for you it
is more like Rabindranath Tagore: it expresses the suffering we make for
ourselves. What you find noteworthy is that although Schell\'s scenario
of widespread destruction of the planet through nuclear weaponry, of
immeasurable harm to the bio-sphere through radiation, is powerfully
laid out, the horror and scale of nuclear obliteration also seems
surreal and far away as the bus makes its way through the suburban
streets.

A few years later, you read a statement from an interview with Paul
Tibbets, the pilot of "Enola Gay," the plane that bombed Hiroshima. He
says, "The morality of dropping that bomb was not my business."19 This
abstraction from moral responsibility\-\--the denial of the implications
on human life and the consequences of engagement through the machinery
of war\-\--together with the sweeping amnesia that came afterwards from
thinking about the bombing of Hiroshima, are what make you become an
environmental and human rights activist. You realise that [what **makes
the nuclear algorithm work** involves a politically engineered and
deeply embedded insecurity-based recipe to **elide the nuclear threat
from everyday life**. The spectre of [nuclear
obliteration]{.mark}]{.underline}, like the idea of human rights, [[can
appear **abstract**]{.mark} and **distant**, **[not our]{.mark} everyday
[business]{.mark}**]{.underline}. You realise that [within [this]{.mark}
recipe [is the creation of a **moral tyranny of distance**]{.mark}, an
abnegation of myself with the other. One of modernity\'s greatest and
earliest achievements was the mediation of the self with the world. How
this became a project assisted and shaped through the
military-industrial-technological-capitalist complex is fraught and hard
to untangle. But as a critical]{.underline} human rights [scholar [you
have]{.mark} come [to **see through that** ]{.mark}**complex**,
[and]{.mark} you [put energies into **challenging that tyranny of
distance**]{.mark}, to activate a **politics**, **ethics** and
**scholarship that recognises the other as integral to
yourself**]{.underline}. Ultimately, even, to see that the other is also
within.20

#### Capitalism is not bounded by the exploitation of labor but extends itself through a productive imperative and the expropriation of land from the Native and the body of the slave. Their appeal to a transition state established by a worker's party \[insert their alternative\] strengthens systems of state-based theft, racial accumulation and policing because the state requires these formations in order to function. 

**Wang 18** \[Jackie, writer, poet, musician, and academic whose writing

African-American Studies @ Harvard, p. 112-25//AK47\]

Racial Capitalism and Settler Colonialism Given the dual character of
capitalist accumulation identified by both Rosa Luxemburg and David
Harvey, what new understanding of capitalism would be generated by
focusing on dispossession and expropriation over .work and production?
Contemporary political theorists as well as critical ethnic studies,
black studies, and Native studies scholars and activists analyze how
racial slavery and seeder colonialism provide the material and
territorial foundation for U.S. and Canadian sovereignty. Rather than
casting slavery and Native genocide as temporally circumscribed events
chat inaugurated the birth of capitalism in the New World (\"primitive
accumulation\"), they show how the racial logics produced by these
processes persist to this day: [In order to recuperate the frame of
political economy, a focus on the dialectic of racial slavery and
settler colonialism leads to important revisions of Karl Marx\'s theory
of primitive accumulation]{.underline}. In particular, Marx designates
the transition from feudal to capitalist social relations as a violent
process of primitive accumulation whereby \"conquest, enslavement,
robbery, murder, in short, force, play the greatest part.\" For Marx,
chis results in the expropriation of the worker, the proletariat, who
becomes the privileged subject of capitalist revolution. \[f we consider
primitive accumulation 35 a persistent structure rather than event, both
[Afro-pessimism and settler colonial studies destabilize normative
conceptions of capitalism through the conceptual displacements of the
proletariat.]{.underline} As Coulthard demonstrates, in considering
Indigenous peoples in relation to primitive accumulation, \"it appears
that the history and experience of dispossession, not
proletarianization, has been the dominant background structure shaping
the character of the historical relationship between Indigenous peoples
and the Canadian state.\" [It is thus dispossession of land through
genocidal elimination, relocation, and theft that animates Indigenous
resistance and anticapitalism]{.underline} and \"less around our
emergent status 35 \'rightless proletarians.\'\" If we extend the frame
of primitive accumulation to the question of slavery, [it is the
dispossession of the slave\'s body rather than the proletarianization of
labor that both precedes and exceeds the frame of settler colonial and
global modernity.]{.underline} 13 [As lyko Day notes, Native
dispossession occurs through the expropriation of land, while black dis􀄅
possession is characterized by enslavement and bodily
dispossession.]{.underline} Although [both racial logics buttress white
accumulation and are defined by a \"genocidal limit
concept\"]{.underline} that constitutes these subjects as disposable,
Day notes that \"the racial content of Indigenous peoples is the mirror
opposite of blackness. From the beginning, an eliminatory project was
driven to reduce Native populations through genocidal wars and later
through statistical elimination through blood quantum and
assimilationist policies. For slaves, an opposite logic of exclusion was
driven to increase, not eliminate, the population of slaves.\"14 A
debate has ensued in critical ethnic studies about which axis of
dispossession is capitalism\'s condition of possibility: the
expropriation of Native land or chattel slavery? Was the U.S. made
possible primarily by unbridled access to black labor, or through
territorial conquest? Is the global racial order defined-as Day
writes-primarily by the indigenous-settler binary or the black-nonblack
binary? At stake in this debate is the question of which axis of
dispossession is the \"base\" from which the \"superstructures\" of
economy, national sovereignty, or even subjectivity itself emerge. Those
who argue that settler colonialism is central have sometimes made the
claim that even black Americans participate in settler colonialism and
indigenous displacement by continuing to live on stolen land, while
those who center slavery and antiblackness have sometimes viewed Native
Americans as perpetrators of anriblackness insofar as some uibes have
historically owned slaves and seek state recognition by making
land-based claims to sovereignty-a claim that relies on a political
grammar that black Americans do not have access to, as slaves were rem
from their native lands when they were transported co the Americas (see
Jared Sexton\'s \"The Vel of Slavery\"). Although weighing in on this
debate is beyond rhe scope of this essay, I generally agree with Day\'s
assertion that to treat this set of issues as a zero-sum game obfuscates
the complexity of these processes. With that said, it is important to
note that this book deals primarily with the antiblack dimensions of
prisons, police, and racial capitalism, though I acknowledge that
analyses of settler colonialism are equally vital to understanding the
operations of racial capitalism and how race is produced through
multiple expropriative logics. Gendered Expropriation Though this book
focuses primarily on black racialization in a contemporary context, it
is worth noting that expropriation reproduces multiple categories of
difference\--including the man-woman gender binary. Although categories
of difference were not invented by capitalism, expropriative processes
assign particular meanings to categories of difference. \"Woman\" is
reproduced as inferior through the unwaged theft of her labor, while the
esteem of the category of \"man\" is propped up by the valorization of
his labor. Even when women are in the professional workforce, they are
still vulnerable to expropriation when they are given or take on work
beyond their formal duties-whether it\'s washing the dishes at the
office, mentoring students, or doing thankless administrative work while
male colleagues gee the \"dysfunctional genius\" pass. But above all,
gendered expropriation occurs through the extraction of care labor,
emotional labor, as well as domestic and reproductive labor all of which
is enabled by the enforcement of a rigid gender binary. This system is
propped up by gender socialization, which compels women to
psychologically internalize a feeling of responsibility for others.
Although, at a glance, ic might seem that the expropriation of women\'s
labor happens primarily through housewifeitization, the marriage
contract, and the assignment of child-care duties to women, in the
current epoch-characterized by an aging baby boomer population and a
shortage of geriatric health-care workers-women are increasingly filling
this void by taking care of sick parents, family members, and loved
ones. It is hardly surprising that two-thirds of those who care for
chose with Alzheimer\'s disease are women, even as women are the primary
victims of this disease. Given thac women\'s lives are often interrupted
by both childcare duties and caring for ailing family members, it\'s
also hardly surprising that women accumulate many fewer assets and arc
more likely to retire into poverty than their male counterparts. A
recent report found that the European Union gender pension gap was 40
percent, which far exceeds the gender pay gap of 16 percent. Overall,
gender is a material relation that, among other things, bilks women of
their futures. The aged woman who has toiled by caring for others is
left with little by the end of her life. Though gender distinctions are
maintained through expropriative processes, they also have consequences
beyond the economic and material realm. While it could be said that
disposability is the logic that corresponds to racialized expropriation,
gendered subjectivation has as its corollary rapeability. It also goes
without saying that these expropriative logics are not mutually
exclusive, as nonwhite women and gender-nonconforming people may be
subject to a different set of expropriative logics than white women.
Racalized Expropriation Although I do not claim that expropriation
should be defined exclusively as racialization (again, because different
expropriative logics reproduce multiple categories of difference), this
book deals primarily with the antiblack racial order that is produced by
late-capitalist accumulation. Michael C. Dawson and Nancy Fraser are two
contemporary political theorists who have defined expropriation as a
racializing process in capitalist societies. In \"Hidden in Plain
Sight,\" Dawson takes Fraser to task for not acknowledging racialized
expropriation as one of the \"background domains\" of capitalist
society. [Understanding the logic of expropriation, in his view, is
necessary for understanding which modes of resistance are needed at this
historical juncture.]{.underline} His article begins with a meditation
on the question: Should activists and movements such as Black Lives
Matter focus on racialized state violence (police shootings, mass
incarceration, and so forth), or should they focus on racialized
inequality cawed by expropriation and exploitation? What is the
relationship between the first logic-characterized by disposability-and
the second logic-characterized by exploitability and expropriability?
Rather than describing these logics as distinct forms of antiblack
racism, he analyzes them as two dimensions of a dynamic process whereby
[capitalist expropriation generates the racial order by fracturing the
population into superior and inferior humans: Understanding the
foundation of capitalism requires a consideration of \"the hidden abode
of race\": the ontological distinction between superior and inferior
humans-codified as race-that was necessary for slavery, colonialism, the
theft of lands in the Americas, and genocide.]{.underline} This racial
separation is manifested in the division between full humans who possess
the right to sell their labor and compete within markets, and chose that
are disposable, discriminated against, and ultimately either eliminated
or superexploited.15 [Black racialization, then, is the mark that
renders subjects as suitable for-on the one hand-hyperexploitation and
expropriation, and, on the other hand, annihilation. Before the
neoliberal era, the racial order was propped up by the state, and racial
distinctions were enforced through legal codification, Jim Crow
segregation, and other formal arrangements. In a contemporary context,
though the legal regime undergirding the racial order has been
dismantled, race has maintained its dual character, which consists of
\"not only a probabilistic assignment of relative economic value but
also an index of differential vulnerability to state violence.\" 16 In
other words, vulnerability to hyperexploitation and expropriation in the
economic domain and vulnerability to premature death in the political
and social domains.]{.underline} My essay on the [Ferguson Police
Department and the city\'s program of municipal plunder]{.underline} is
an attempt to [make visible the hidden backdrop of Mike Brown\'s
execution: the widespread racialized expropriation of black residents
carried out by the criminal justice arm of the state. It is not just
that Mike Brown\'s murder happened alongside the looting of residents at
the behest of the police and the city\'s financial manager, but that
racial legacies that have marked black residents as lootable are
intimately tied to police officers\' treatment of black people as
killable. The two logics reinforce and are bound up with each
other.]{.underline} In her response co Dawson\'s analysis of
racialization as expropriation, Fraser develops Dawson\'s claims by
looking at the interplay between economic expropriation and
\"politically enforced status distinctions.\" 17 [Not only does
accumulation in a capitalist society occur along the two axes of
exploitation and expropriation, but one makes the other possible in that
the \"racialized subjection of those whom capital expropriates is a
condition of possibility for the freedom of those whom it
exploits.]{.underline}\" 18 [In other words, the \"front story\" of free
workers who are contracted by capitalists to sell their labor-power for
a wage is enabled by, and depends on, expropriation that takes place
outside this contractual arrangement.]{.underline}

Fraser further extends Dawson\'s analysis by offering a historical
account of the various regimes of racialization. In her analysis of the
\"proletarianization\" of black Americans as they migrated from the
South to industrial centers in the North and Midwest during the flrst
half of the twentieth century, she points out that even in the context
of industrial \"exploitation,\" the segmented labor market was organized
such that a \"confiscatory premium was placed on black labor.\" Black
industrial workers were paid less than their white counterparts. In some
sense, the racialized gap in earnings can be thought of as the portion
that was expropriated from black workers. It is not as though the black
laborers who joined the ranks of the industrial proletariat were newly
subjected to exploitation rather than expropriation, but that these two
methods of accumulation were operating in tandem. [In the \"present
regime of racialized accumulation\"- which she refers to as
\"financialized capitalism\"-Fraser notes that there has been a
loosening of the binary that has historically separated who should be
subjected to expropriation from]{.underline} who should be subjected to
exploitation, and that [during the present period]{.underline}, debt is
regularly deployed as a method of dispossession: Much large-scale
industrial exploitation now occurs outside the historic core, in the
BRICS countries of the semi-periphery. And [expropriation has become
ubiquitous, afflicting not only its traditional subjects but also those
who were previously shielded by their status as
citizenworkers.]{.underline} In these developments, debt plays a major
role, [as global financial institutions pressure states to collude with
investors in extracting value from defenseless populations.]{.underline}
19 While I agree with Fraser\'s claim that the \"sharp divide\" berween
\"expropriab le subjects and exploitable citizen-workers\" has been
replaced by a \"contin uum\" (albeit a continuum chat remains
racialized), I would add that [the existence of poor whites who have
fallen out of the middle class or have been affected by the opiate
crisis at the present juncture represents not racial progress for black
Americans, but the generalization of expropriability as a condition in
the face of an accumulation crisis. In other words, immiseration for all
rather than a growing respect for black Americans.]{.underline} Fraser
rightly points out that \"expropriation becomes tempting in periods of
crisis.\"20 Sometimes the methods of accumulation that were once
reserved exclusively for racialized subjects bleed over and are used on
those with privileged status markings. [If expropriation and
exploitation now occur on a continuum, then it has been made possible,
in part, by late capitalism\'s current modus operandi: the probabilistic
ranking of subjects according to risk]{.underline}, sometimes indexed by
a person\'s credit score. As I will demonstrate in the coming sections,
this method is not a race-neutral way of gleaning information about a
subject\'s personal integrity, credibility, or financial responsibility.
It is merely an index of already-existing inequality and a way to
distinguish between which people should be expropriated from and which
should be merely exploited.

### 2ac capitalism top level 

#### All or nothing critique of capital relies on a flawed critique of reform-no root cause, no alt solvency-those arguments are based on essentialist assumptions 

**ROBBINS, PhD Harvard, 13**

(BRUCE, Old Dominion Foundation Professor in the Humanities,

[BALIBAR']{.underline}S NEW BOOKS [will appear in an intellectual
landscape where a **revolutionary Marxism**]{.underline} --- at least
from a glance at bookstores and syllabi --- [is still in
vogue]{.underline}. Ambivalent as they are about revolution, what kind
of reception will these books receive? Why do people read Marxist
philosophers anyway? [It would be hard to argue]{.underline} that [the
fashion for Marxism]{.underline} during the past decade or so [has had
anything to do with the]{.underline} perceived **[proximity of
revolution]{.underline}** or even the strength or militancy of
working-class organizations. [In the]{.underline} 19[60s]{.underline}
[Marxist]{.underline} writer[s rode a wave of political
energy]{.underline} and hope. [That has]{.underline} mostly [not been
true]{.underline} for the generation that came of age around or [after
September 11]{.underline}, 2001, which saw [inequality and unemployment
rising]{.underline} but [labor unions]{.underline} and left-wing parties
[falling]{.underline}. Interest in Marxism makes more sense as a
response to the intensified financialization and globalization of
capital, with its most revelatory moments in the bursting of the dot-com
bubble in 2000--01 and more recently the 2008 financial crisis. It seems
worth adding here that the digital revolution, which did for today's
generation something like what the Industrial Revolution did for
Marx --- prove that dramatic change was possible --- helps explain some
of the otherwise inexplicable enthusiasm for Hardt and Negri. As Balibar
observes, their argument splits apart the Marxist concept of the
material base, making much of (digital) technology, which has changed,
but leaving out the relations of production, which have not, or at least
not for the better. If you want to be a serious materialist, he says,
you have to hold onto both. [One consequence of
capitalism's]{.underline} ever-firmer annexation of the global scale and
[ever-tighter squeezing]{.underline} of the majority's living standards
has been that ordinary [domestic politics]{.underline}, especially
electoral politics, [have come to feel]{.underline} ever more trivial
and [irrelevant]{.underline}. One need only look at voter turnout, even
for elections like 2008, to see that abstention is the one principle in
the US that enjoys broad consensus. Under these circumstances, [even
hard-won battles in the name of race, gender, and sexuality
could]{.underline} come to [seem a bit beside the point.]{.underline} To
Žižek, who routinely gets laughs at the expense of multiculturalism,
Balibar no doubt looks too eager to please the "identity"
constituencies. [To Balibar, Žižek and Badiou]{.underline} no doubt
[seem to have given up on the idea of **speaking to any
constituencies --- **that is,]{.underline} to have [given
up]{.underline} [on the project of **politics.**]{.underline}
Paradoxical as it may seem, [giving up on politics has]{.underline}
probably **[been part of Marxism's seductiveness for a long
time]{.underline}**. [No one in Balibar's cohort]{.underline} (Balibar
was born in 1942, Badiou in 1937, Rancière in 1940, Žižek in 1949) could
have felt confident that as Marxists they [came of age at a propitious
time for plunging into the class struggle.]{.underline} If 1968 didn't
turn out to be the revolutionary conjuncture, no moment that has
followed has come closer. [In nonrevolutionary times, the most
**tempting and pervasive of revisionisms** is to **give up on changing
the world and just interpret it**]{.underline}. [Nothing supplies
serviceable analytic distance like the conviction that you don't have a
horse in this race]{.underline}. [Witness the quietism of the New Left
Review]{.underline}, the foremost organ of Marxism in the
English-speaking world and yet a journal that you go to for searching
analysis, not for uplifting news of movements and conflicts. For some
years NLR, strongly influenced by Althusser, ostentatiously ignored
thinkers in the messianic mode --- and bless them for it. But [isn't
there a sort of secret alliance between messianism and
quietism]{.underline}? How can you stay so coolly detached unless you're
absolutely sure that in the end your day will come? [Balibar wants no
part of this alliance. His unwillingness to maintain an authoritative
detachment from]{.underline} ongoing [political struggles, however
insignificant posterity may judge those struggles to be, is of a piece
with his lack of certainty that he knows where History is going or who
will lead it there.]{.underline} For some readers, this will be
frustrating. [His distaste for political theology, his premise that even
in situations of political urgency there is no excuse for pretending
that Marxism has all the answers, has doubtless driven away some
who]{.underline}, whether aware of it or not, [**preferred a system that
did have all the answers** while also preferring prophets who carry
those answers down from the mountain and deliver them in
thunder.]{.underline} This seems the most likely reason why, as radical
social transformation has reappeared as a historical possibility, as
Marxism has reappeared to analyze its chances, and as Americans in
search of political enlightenment continue to eavesdrop on exchanges
among left-wing French philosophers, many of them Althusser's former
students, Balibar has had less of a hearing than the aging superstars
around him. It is true that Balibar is personally mild, self-deprecating
almost to a fault, and does not seek out occasions for newsworthy
confrontation. David Rieff observes in a nasty but not inaccurate review
of Claude Lanz-mann's recent memoir that "self-deprecation has never
been much prized in French intellectual life." Things are not so
different in the US. For whatever reasons, Balibar's putative rivals
have also largely avoided on-screen collisions with him. I note that
Žižek calls Balibar out in two of his books, Revolution at the Gates and
The Ticklish Subject --- and then, seemingly forgetting he's thrown down
the gauntlet, devotes most of his pages to Badiou. Is Badiou an easier
target? If so, what makes Balibar a harder one? Consider The Idea of
Communism (2010), a collection of papers delivered with much fanfare at
Birkbeck College in London in 2009, a year or so into the financial
crisis, and coedited by the conference organizers, Žižek and Costas
Douzinas. Balibar is not included in the collection (he was invited to
the conference but was stuck teaching in California) and he is not cited
in the index. His omission from the index is especially curious because
he is in fact argued with, at least glancingly, in two places that I
noticed: on the question, What is politics? and on the question, Should
the left claim human rights? In both cases the underlying issue is
whether it's hopelessly naive to engage in politics at the level of the
state. [Balibar is taken]{.underline}, rightly, **[as assuming that
politics at the level of the state, rights, and law remains a
significant obligation]{.underline}**. [It's clear that the other
speakers disagree, but they **don't feel obliged to spell out
why.**]{.underline} [Badiou's contribution]{.underline} to The Idea of
Communism [openly rejects]{.underline} the enterprise of "[ordinary"
politics]{.underline}. (Much might be said about the assumption that
passing previously unimaginable legislation like the forty-hour workweek
or the graduated income tax or the regulation of the financial industry
would count as "ordinary.") Badiou takes as his premise that "ordinary
history" is "confined within the State." By contrast, the kind of
history he thinks we need, the kind that is not confined within the
State, is history that is faithful to "the Idea." [Badiou takes his
argument about "the Idea]{.underline}" from Plato, whose usefulness to
the left he seems recklessly eager to promote. But [there is something
post-Hellenic about]{.underline} the idea of [an Idea that floats above
ordinary history and beams encouragingly down on those]{.underline},
wherever and whenever they are, who are [distressed by life on the
ground]{.underline}. This might be what Balibar had in mind when he
called Badiou a theologian. In the same volume Bruno B[osteels describes
the disagreements]{.underline} among Badiou, Žižek, Rancière, and
Balibar [as the "fights of a dysfunctional family]{.underline}." He
doesn't designate parents and children, but he admits that **[Lenin had
a point when he described the dogmatic antistatism of the
holier-than-thou Communists to his left as indicative of "an infantile
disorder."]{.underline}** Rather than thinking of the family members as
squabbling over who loves Marx most or who was Althusser's favorite, [it
seems more generous to imagine them deciding whether to invest their
nest egg in political ventures that may or may not pay off]{.underline}.
Many of the [issues that have filled the news over the past
decades --- ethnic cleansing, violence against immigrants, Palestinian
self-determination, European unity --- have **not exactly cried out for
a Marxist vocabulary.**]{.underline} What about, say, Europe? Europe is
a subject that absorbed much of Balibar's attention in the 1990s and has
continued to preoccupy him since --- see Politics and the Other Scene
(2002) and We, the People of Europe? (2004) as well as a volume now out
in France, Europe, crise et fin? His latest pronouncements have been
extremely pessimistic. But they emerge against his expectation that the
project of European unification, rather than a ploy of the bankers
and/or a creative new version of apartheid, might become a site of
bottom-up democratic zeal and give birth to a new set of transnational
institutions. As Žižek notes disapprovingly, this [**hopefulness** sets
Balibar against both the antistatism of the New Left and **current
cynicism** about an emergent transnational politics of any
kind]{.underline}. [Balibar's line on Europe is not that we should make
the best of the European institutions we have]{.underline}, poor as
their performance has been. Those institutions have failed, he says,
definitively. [Where he differs from his cohort is in his passionate
will to see them replaced]{.underline} --- in other words, his refusal
to give up on Europe altogether. [His critique of "**statism without a
State"---technocratic top-down solutions to the European
crisis**]{.underline} [without encouragement of broad democratic
participation --- assumes]{.underline} (against Rancière's argument in
his own essay on French solidarity with Algeria) [that democracy is
possible not just on a national but a transnational scale]{.underline}.
[Balibar's call for a left populism to counter the racist, xenophobic
populism that threatens to become the only populism we can recognize in
Europe also assumes]{.underline} (here he borrows from Rancière and
diverges from Žižek) **[that racism is not a fixed psychic quantity that
cannot be diminished by any conceivable rejiggering of social
arrangements.]{.underline}** And it assumes (arguing with both Žižek and
Badiou) that democracy is a good in itself, and that, stretched and
intensified, it might create the sort of European institutions that the
victims of European integration (many of them, like the Greeks, still
theoretically committed to the European Union) will like a lot better.

### 2ac identity 

#### Do Both- we can have contingent coalitions not rooted in static identity. These coalitions are *more effective*

**Butler, PhD, 90**

(Judith, [Gender Trouble]{.underline})

Some [efforts have been made to formulate coalitional politics
which]{.underline} [do not assume in advance]{.underline} what [the
content]{.underline} of "women" will be. [They propose instead a set of
dialogic encounters by which variously positioned women articulate
separate identities within the]{.underline} framework of an emergent
[coalition.]{.underline} Clearly, [the value of coalitional politics is
not to be underestimated, but the]{.underline} very [form of
coalition]{.underline}, of an emerging and unpredictable assemblage of
positions, [cannot be figured in advance]{.underline}. Despite the
clearly democratizing impulse that motivates coalition building, [the
coalitional theorist can]{.underline} [inadvertently reinsert herself
**as sovereign**]{.underline} of the process [by trying to assert an
**ideal form for coalitional structures in advance**]{.underline}, one
that will effectively guarantee unity as the outcome. [Related efforts
to determine]{.underline} what is and is not [the true shape of a
dialogue]{.underline}, [what constitutes a
subject]{.underline}-position, [and]{.underline}, most importantly,
[when "unity" has been reached, can impede the]{.underline} self-shaping
and self-limiting dynamics of [coalition.]{.underline} The [insistence
in advance on]{.underline} coalitional "[unity]{.underline}" as a goal
[assumes]{.underline} that [solidarity]{.underline}, **[whatever its
price]{.underline}**, [is a prerequisite]{.underline} [for political
action]{.underline}. [But what]{.underline} sort of [politics demands
that]{.underline} kind of advance purchase on unity?
[Perhaps]{.underline} a [coalition needs]{.underline} to acknowledge its
[contradictions]{.underline} and take action with those contradictions
intact. Perhaps also part of what [dialogic understanding
entails]{.underline} is the [acceptance of divergence]{.underline},
breakage, splinter, and fragmentation [as part of the]{.underline} often
tortuous [process]{.underline} of democratization. [The very notion of
"dialogue" is **culturally specific and historically
bound**]{.underline}, and while one speaker may feel secure that a
conversation is happening, another may be sure it is not. The power
relations that condition and limit dialogic possibilities need first to
be interrogated. Otherwise, the model of dialogue risks relapsing into a
liberal model that assumes that speaking agents occupy equal positions
of power and speak with the same presuppositions about what constitutes
"agreement" and "unity" and, indeed, that those are the goals to be
sought. It would be wrong to assume in advance that there is a category
of "women" that simply needs to be filled in with various components of
race, class, age, ethnicity, and sexuality in order to become complete.
The assumption of its essential incompleteness permits that category to
serve as a permanently available site of contested meanings. The
definitional incompleteness of the category might then serve as a
normative ideal relieved of coercive force. Is "unity" necessary for
effective political action? Is the premature insistence on the goal of
unity precisely the cause of an ever more bitter fragmentation among the
ranks? Certain forms of acknowledged [fragmentation might facilitate
coalitional action]{.underline} [precisely because]{.underline} the
"[unity]{.underline}" of the category of women [is neither presupposed
nor desired]{.underline}. Does "unity" set up an exclusionary norm of
solidarity at the level of identity that rules out the possibility of a
set of actions which disrupt the very borders of identity concepts, or
which seek to accomplish precisely that disruption as an explicit
political aim? [Without the presupposition]{.underline} or goal [of
"unity]{.underline}," which is, in either case, always instituted at a
conceptual level, **[provisional unities]{.underline}** [might
emerge]{.underline} [in the context of concrete actions that have
purposes other than the articulation of identity.]{.underline} Without
the compulsory expectation that feminist actions must be instituted from
some stable, unified, and agreed-upon identity, [those actions might
well get **a quicker start** and seem **more congenial**]{.underline} to
a number of "women" for whom the meaning of the category is permanently
moot. [This antifoundationalist approach to coalition]{.underline}al
politics [assumes neither that "identity" is a premise nor that the
shape or meaning of a coalitional assemblage can be known
prior]{.underline} to its achievement. Because the [articulation of an
identity within available]{.underline} cultural [terms instates a
definition that **forecloses in advance**]{.underline} the [emergence of
new identity concepts]{.underline} in and through politically engaged
actions, [the foundationalist tactic cannot take]{.underline} the
[transformation]{.underline} or expansion [of existing identity concepts
as a normative goal]{.underline}. Moreover, [when agreed-upon
identities]{.underline} or agreed-upon dialogic structures, through
which already established identities are communicated, [no longer
constitute the]{.underline} theme or [subject of politics]{.underline},
then [identities can come into being and dissolve depending on the
concrete practices that constitute them]{.underline}. **[Certain
political practices institute identities on a contingent basis in order
to accomplish whatever aims are in view]{.underline}**. Coalitional
politics requires neither an expanded category of "women" nor an
internally multiplicitous self that offers its complexity at once.
Gender is a complexity whose totality is permanently deferred, never
fully what it is at any given juncture in time. An open coalition, then,
will affirm identities that are alternately instituted and relinquished
according to the purposes at hand; it will be an open assemblage that
permits of multiple convergences and divergences without obedience to a
normative telos of definitional closure. (this is from a bootleg epub
with no page numbers but this appears to be around page 15)

### 2ac perm

#### Permutation do both -- undertaking an intercommunal perspective incorporates the useful political programs of the alternative with the orientation and planning of the affirmative

**Narayan 17** \-- John Narayan (2017) Department of Sociology,
University of Warwick, Coventry, UK The wages of whiteness in the
absence of wages: racial capitalism, reactionary intercommunalism and
the rise of Trumpism, Third World Quarterly, 38:11, 2482-2500, DOI:
10.1080/01436597.2017.1368012

Conclusion: dealing with the end of the wages of whiteness This article
has attempted to retrieve Huey P. Newton's seemingly forgotten
theorisation of imperialism's transition to reactionary
intercommunalism, not only to achieve some form of epistemic justice,
but also because Newton's thought speaks urgently to our present. It has
taken over 40 years for the contours of a truly global capitalism to
match up with Newton's proto-theorisation of neo-liberal globalisation.
But Newton's theoretical prescience also centres on his appreciation of
how such changes would be refracted through issues of race and whiteness
that underpin the US state and its economy. In conclusion, I want to
reflect on Newton's thought and why we should return to his ideas to
understand the era of Trumpism. It is my contention that Newton's
reflection on what the future may hold under reactionary
intercommunalism may in fact be words about our present. In a 1972
discussion with sociologists Franz Schurmann and Alberto Martinelli,
Newton outlined his theory of intercommunalism and the future's likely
political trajectory. Newton's main point to Schurmann and Martinelli
was that the changes associated with reactionary intercommunalism,
chiefly its technological displacement of jobs and the global spread of
capitalist social relations, meant that Western imperialism's wages of
whiteness, where imperial conquest led to a bargain between capital and
the white working and middle classes in the metropole, were effectively
over. Indeed, as Newton told an audience at Yale in 1971, he hoped white
America would unite with 'those people who are already unemployable',
but whether this did or didn't happen that 'material existence will have
changed. The proletarian will become the lumpen proletarian'.60 Newton's
interview with Schurmann and Martinelli saw him declare that either the
white US population would come to terms with this reality, and embrace
the objective class relations between themselves and the vast array of
humanity, or they would start on a path towards world war three: The
people here have to realize that they live at the expense of the world,
and this includes the workers. Either the people will oppose the
reactionary circle for survival, for peace, or else they will go into
the third world war. So [our basic problem is educating and
organizing]{.underline}.61 Returning to Newton's ruminations on the
impossibly of resupplying the wages of whiteness highlights how
dangerous the death of the wages of whiteness may actually be for us all
today. [Trumpism's attempt to resupply the wages of whiteness through
racism, nationalism and xenophobia, places humanity on a likely path
towards war.]{.underline} Despite Trump's claim that 'jobs will return,
incomes will rise and new factories will come rushing back to our
shores',62 Trumpism is unlikely to supply any jobs and material wages to
its supporters because it is not designed or capable of doing so. Just
as Du Bois highlighted at the start of the twentieth century that the
[wages of whiteness were designed by the elite to split class unity
along racial lines, Trumpism's wages of whiteness appear designed to
split class unity for elite ends]{.underline} at the start of the
twenty-first century. Trump's economic plans, dubbed 'Trumponomics',
essentially repackage neo-liberal 'trickle-down' policies with the
promise of Keynesian stimulus. Trump has proposed massive infrastructure
spending combined with huge tax cuts for the rich and corporations and
further deregulation in the hope of generating investment and jobs. The
30-year track record of neo-liberalism has shown that these policies are
unlikely to illicit investment in the economy and such a strategy seems
incapable of addressing how technology, as Newton realised, will
eliminate ever more jobs.63 As such, [Trumpism will likely continue the
processes of enriching elites and corporations]{.underline} at the
expense of all members of the working and middle classes.64 This failure
to supply the economic wages of whiteness will in turn likely be
[supplemented with the overtures to trade protectionism (Border Tax),
racist and xenophobic polices]{.underline} such as (Muslim) travel bans,
illegal migrant deportations, border wall building [and military actions
that aim to supply the psychological aspects of the wages of
whiteness.]{.underline} This will simply be the supplying of the wages
of whiteness in the absence of wages. [There thus appears more chance
that we shall see a race war in the US than any potential class
struggle. However, the changes brought about by reactionary
intercommunalism have also changed the nature of geo-politics and made
such resurgent nationalism a more likely conduit for war on the
international stage.]{.underline} The quest to remake the world in the
American image, or rather in its interests, has enriched non-Western
elites and empowered nations in the Global South in ways even Newton
could not have foreseen. Although the 'neo-liberalism with southern
characteristics' of the BRICS bloc does not yet mark an ideological and
geo-political alternative to US and wider Western power, it does mark a
world of increasing multi-polarity.65 What chance that a trade war or
imperial proxy war induced by Trumpism could lead to what Newton called
the third world war? Yet, [Newton's thought also offers us a vision of
an alternative]{.underline} approach to dealing with the end of the
wages of whiteness and perhaps herein lays the true value of returning
to Newton in the age of Trumpism. Newton's discussion with Schurmann and
Martinelli revealed his frustration with the Western left's fixation
with the 'factory as a phase that does not go through transformation'.66
In Newton's eyes [the left couldn't simply repeat the fantasy of
returning to the post-war settlement between labour and
capital.]{.underline} Not only was such a position unachievable due to
the changes induced by reactionary intercommunalism, but also because
[such a position failed to see how]{.underline} the post-war era of
[embedded liberalism was itself a racialised imperial formation. Newton
argued against nostalgic pleas for national forms of socialism, which
had been used to imperially split humanity across the
colour-line,]{.underline} and for a transnational politics he called
'Revolutionary intercommunalism'.67 Revolutionary intercommunalism
functioned off the recognition of the interconnected nature of the
global economy and the need to deliver equality and justice for the
entirety of the world's communities. Above all else, [revolutionary
intercommunalism rejected the idea that nationalist settlements, whether
Black, white or socialist, were the pathways towards
liberation.]{.underline} In light of reactionary intercommunalism's
global dimensions, Newton argued that [only a global form of
justice]{.underline} that would equally share the productivity and
resource gains of technology [would now suffice: In order for a
revolution to occur in the United States you would have to have a
redistribution of wealth not on a national or international level, but
on an intercommunal level.]{.underline} Because how can we say that we
have accomplished revolution if we redistribute the wealth just to
people here in North America when the ruling circle itself is guilty of
trespass de bonis asportatis. That is, they have taken away the goods of
the people of the world, transported them to America and used them as
their very own.68 [Revolutionary intercommunalism saw the BPP create
alliances with a plethora of social movements]{.underline} both within
and beyond the US. These included the student-led anti-Vietnam War and
Peace movements, Latino groups like the Young Lords Organisation and
poor white American groups like the Young Patriots Organisation and
'peoples of world' pursuing nationhood, such the National Liberation
Front in South Vietnam (NLF), the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO)
and Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO). 69 [The aim of
revolutionary intercommunalism was not only to create a united front of
oppressed peoples against global capitalism, but also to create
alternative forms of life to the capitalist way of life. This ethos was
exemplified in the BBP's 'survival]{.underline}
[programmes']{.underline}, community-based programmes that were set-up
and run by the Panthers and wider community to provide services [such as
free healthcare,]{.underline} free breakfasts for school children and
free clothing for the Black community and other communities who had been
excluded from the spoils of US capitalism. As Singh has suggested, the
practices of the BPP's [survival programmes not only filled these gaps
in welfare but also provided a 'projection of sovereignty' that rivalled
the 'reality principle' of the US state.70 This entailed a practical
deconstruction of the idea of state power (policing, education, welfare)
that reimagined spaces and practices along new intercommunal lines of
self-determination and democracy. Through attempting to disrupt class
relations, racial segregation and gender roles, the BPP's survival
programmes also attempted to offer alternative ways of life, both
institutionally and ideologically, to the racially divisive, class
exploitative and gendered structures of capitalist
society]{.underline}.71 The value of returning to Newton's thought today
thus lays not only with his appreciation of how reactionary
intercommunalism would be refracted through issues of race and
whiteness, but also with how Newton's vision of revolutionary
intercommunalism demands us to link the project of anti-imperialist
solidarity with the creation of alternative intercommunal ways of life
to capitalist society. This especially pertinent given that [Trumpism's
critique of neo-liberal globalisation ironically shares elements of the
left's own social democratic critique of neo-liberal globalisation.72
Although violently disagreeing on the means, both Trumpism and social
democracy aim towards the end of taming global capitalism through
reasserting national controls]{.underline} (whether this is through
racist approaches to immigration or raising taxes) and alleviating
economic insecurity through job creation (whether this is through
deregulation and tax cuts or increased regulation and government
spending). Newton's work on [intercommunalism leads us to question the
very categories of labour, nation, capital and democracy that underpin
both Trumpism and contemporary social democratic politics.]{.underline}
For example, Newton's theory of intercommunalism makes it clear that we
must question the linking of wage labour and income in an environment
where technology eliminates vast sways of jobs and labour markets are
racially discriminatory. Moreover, we must ask this question with a
global rather than solely a national inflexion. Newton's thought thus
demands that we consider a new politics that would create new
institutions and ideologies that could serve and liberate communities
both within and beyond the boundaries of nation states. Returning to
[Newton's theorisation]{.underline} of reactionary intercommunalism, and
his conclusion that both white supremacy and nationally bounded
socialism were incapable of dealing with the contradictions of global
capital, thus [implores us to pursue a politics of intercommunal
revolution rather than mere national reform]{.underline}. This may sound
idealistic as we encounter the re-emergence of racist populism in the US
and wider Western world.73 However, Newton's work reminds us that the
contradictions of racial capitalism under the machinations of
reactionary intercommunalism also offer the possibilities of hope as
well as horror. Newton saw a chance for intercommunal solidarity and the
creation of alternative forms of life because he believed the effects of
the dwindling wages of whiteness now meant that the white populaces in
the US were 'more ready to fight' than ever before. The key was to
answer the questions 'who shall he fight? Who is your enemy? Who is your
friend?' Newton challenged the left in the West 'to show \[that\] the
other unemployables are not the enemy'.74 In our contemporary moment
these words, and the anti-racist and anti-imperialist politics they
commit us to, seem as urgent as the time they were first spoken.

#### The perm represents "mature marx"- their indicts will reinforce theologic interpretations at the expense of scripture- apply epistemic modesty 

**ROBBINS, PhD Harvard, 13**

(BRUCE, Old Dominion Foundation Professor in the Humanities,
https://nplusonemag.com/issue-16/reviews/balibarism/)

[AS A STUDENT OF ALTHUSSER]{.underline} IN THE 1960S, [Balibar took to
heart his master's desire to detach Marxism from Hegel]{.underline}.
[Hegel was seen]{.underline} (a bit tendentiously) by Althusser and his
disciples [as a confident oracle of the End of History]{.underline}; and
[their aim was]{.underline}, through a close and even reverent reading
of Marx's texts, to [expose a mature Marx who had been through an
"**epistemological rupture**," breaking with his early Hegelian
faith,]{.underline} and [who by the time he wrote Capital had embraced a
**more complex and open-ended model of history**]{.underline}. [History
had to be interpreted the way Freud interpreted
dreams]{.underline} --- as [motivated and structured, but with a
quotient of randomness]{.underline} and openness to reinterpretation.
Seeing history as analogous to dreams risked conceding that Marxism had
something in common with wishful fantasy, but [Althusser thought it made
Marxism more scientific]{.underline}. In at least one sense it did:
[genuine science accepts the limits of its own knowledge]{.underline}.
[Balibar,]{.underline} not much interested in scientificity,
[was]{.underline} clearly [enticed]{.underline} from the beginning **[by
modesty about the limits of knowledge]{.underline}**. Neither he nor
Althusser put it this way, but [their]{.underline} shared [project might
be described as a **secularizing of Marxism.** After
Stalin]{.underline}, [many]{.underline} thinkers [were ready to abandon
Marxism altogether]{.underline}. [For those who wanted to save
it]{.underline} --- that was the grand but also defensive goal that
Althusser announced to his students, Balibar among them, on the first
day of the 1965 seminar that was to become Reading Capital --- [one
option was to return to the founding texts of historical materialism and
read them afresh, liberated from their **decades of service to Party
dogma**.]{.underline} Like the Protestants of the Reformation, [Marxists
would get out from under the authority of the Church by appealing to the
authority of Scriptur]{.underline}e. [This]{.underline} of course [would
involve a resacralizing of Marx's texts]{.underline} --- something of an
irony for a secularizing project. The secular always seems to need more
secularizing. In this sense, Balibar's series of studies from the 1980s
(some of them collected in English under the title Masses, Classes and
Ideas) was indeed secular and even detheologizing, [a sort of
Nietzschean--Rortyan experiment in thinking Marxism **without its
god-terms**.]{.underline} For example, the concept of [ideology went
unmentioned in Marx's Capital]{.underline}, Balibar observed, and this
was [because Capital had no need of it: if the fetishism of the
commodity is working, it will do the job,]{.underline} mistakenly
assigned to ideology, [of making exploitation look like the breaks of
the game.]{.underline} [Balibar]{.underline} thus [gently encouraged
Marxists to make better use of their time than **accusing others of
false consciousness.** Like ideology, the]{.underline} concept of the
[proletariat]{.underline}, so prominent in The Communist Manifesto,
[**could also be jettisoned**. According to]{.underline} the predictions
of the [mature Marx]{.underline}, [the only class that would come to
full political selfhood under the capitalist system is the
bourgeoisie]{.underline}. **[The proletariat names a political potential
that could well remain unfulfilled]{.underline}** (as it has). [This
argument had the fortunate result of rendering unnecessary the
proletariat's predicted emergence as a self-conscious revolutionary
subject]{.underline}; the usefulness of Marx's analysis of capital could
be demonstrated without it (as it has). Balibar was proposing in effect
that Marx offered no providential assurance that things would work out
in the end. [This was Marxism without a Book of Revelation]{.underline}.

### 2ac marxism fails

#### The worker has disappeared \-\-- the lack of spatial proximity and continuity between workers denies the possibility of class solidarity fomenting meaningful resistance. Moreover, Marx's economic theory understands labor as divisible into discrete units of time, but the floating, arbitrary value of money combined with the depersonalization of time means today's cognitive worker no longer has no discrete surplus-value to be stolen

**Bifo 15** \[Francesco 'Bifo' Berardi, Professor of Social History of
Communication at the Accademia di Belle Arti of Milan, *Heroes: Mass
Murder and Suicide*, Verso: Brooklyn, NY, 2015, p. 138-42\]

[The recombinant **alliance** of **cognitive work and financial capital
was over**]{.underline}. [The young army of free agents, selfexploiters
and virtual prosumers was transformed into modernity's horde of
precarious cognitive workers: **cognitarians**]{.underline}, [cognitive
proletarians and internet-slaves who invest nervous energy in exchange
for a precarious revenue.]{.underline}

**[Precarity is the general condition of semio-workers.]{.underline}**
[The essential feature of precarity in the social sphere is not the loss
of regularity in the labour relation, since labour has always been more
or less precarious]{.underline}, notwithstanding legal regulations[. The
essential transformation induced by the digitalization of the labour
process is the fragmentation of the personal continuity of work, the
fractalization and cellularization of time. The **worker disappears as a
person**]{.underline}, and is replaced by abstract fragments of time.
The cyberspace of global production can be viewed as an immense expanse
of depersonalized human time. [In the sphere of industrial production,
abstract labour time was embodied in a worker of flesh and bone, with a
certified and political identity]{.underline}. When [the
boss]{.underline} was in need of human time for capital valorization, he
[was obliged to hire a human being, and was obliged to deal with the
physical weaknesses]{.underline}, maladies and rights of this human
being; was obliged to face trade unions reclaims and the political
demands of which the human was a bearer.

As we move into the age of info-labour, [there is no longer a need to
invest in the availability of a person for eight hours a
day]{.underline} throughout the duration of his or her life. [Capital no
longer recruits people, but buys packets of time, separated from their
interchangeable and occasional bearers]{.underline}. In the internet
economy, flexibility has evolved into a form of fractalization of work.

Fractalization is the modular and recombinant fragmentation of the
period of activity. [The worker no longer exists as a
person]{.underline}. He or she is only an interchangeable producer of
micro-fragments of recombinant semiosis that enter into the continuous
flux of the internet. Capital no longer pays for the availability of a
worker to be exploited for a long period of time; it no longer pays a
salary that covers the entire range of economic needs of a person who
works.

The worker (a machine endowed with a brain that can be used for
fragments of time) is paid for his or her occasional, temporary
services. Work time is fragmented and cellularized. Cells of time are
put up for sale online, and businesses can purchase as many of them as
they want without being obligated in any way to provide any social
protection to the worker. [Depersonalized time has become the real agent
of the process of valorization, and depersonalized time has no rights,
no union organization and no political consciousness]{.underline}. It
can only be either available or unavailable -- although this latter
alternative remains purely theoretical inasmuch as the physical body
still has to buy food and pay rent, despite not being a legally
recognized person.

[The time necessary to produce the info-commodity is liquefied by the
recombinant digital machine]{.underline}. The human machine is there,
pulsating and available, like a brainsprawl in waiting. The extension of
time is meticulously cellularized: cells of productive time can be
mobilized in punctual, casual and fragmentary forms. The recombination
of these fragments is automatically realized in the network. [The mobile
phone is the tool that makes possible the connection between the needs
of semiocapital and the mobilization of the living labour of
cyberspac]{.underline}e. The ringtone of the mobile phone summons
workers to reconnect their abstract time to the reticular flux.

In this new labour dimension, people [have no right to protect or
negotiate the time of which they are formally the proprietors, but are
effectively expropriated. That time does not really belong to them,
because it is separated from the social existence of the people who make
it available to the recombinant cyber-productive circuit.]{.underline}
The time of work is fractalized, reduced to minimal fragments that can
be reassembled, and the fractalization makes it possible for capital to
constantly find the conditions of the minimal salary. **[Fractalized
work can punctually rebel, here and there, at certain points -- but this
does not set into motion any concerted endeavour of
resistance.]{.underline}**

**[Only the spatial proximity of the bodies of labourers and the
continuity of the experience of working together lead to the possibility
of a continuous process of solidarity]{.underline}**. [Without this
proximity and this continuity, the conditions for the cellularized
bodies to coalesce into community do not pertain.]{.underline}
[Individual behaviours can only come together to form a substantive
collective momentum when there is a **continuous proximity in time, a
proximity that info-labour no longer makes possible.**]{.underline}

Cognitive activity has always been involved in every kind of human
production, even that of a more mechanical type. There is no process of
human labour that does not involve an exercise of intelligence. But
today, **[cognitive capacity is becoming the essential productive
resource]{.underline}**. In the age of industrial labour, the mind was
put to work as a repetitive automatism, the neurological director of
muscular effort. While industrial work was essentially repetition of
physical acts, mental work is continuously changing its object and its
procedures.

Thus, the subsumption of the mind in the process of capitalist
valorization leads to a true mutation. [The conscious and sensitive
organism is subjected to a growing competitive pressure, to an
acceleration of stimuli]{.underline}, to a constant exertion of his/her
attention. As a consequence, [the mental environment, the info-sphere in
which the mind is formed and enters into relations with other minds,
becomes a psychopathogenic environment.]{.underline}

[To understand semiocapital's infinite game of mirrors, we must first
outline a new disciplinary field, delimited by three aspects: the
critique of political economy of connective intelligence; the semiology
of linguistic-economic fluxes; and the psychochemistry of the
info-sphere, focused on the study of the psychopathological effects of
the mental exploitation caused by the acceleration of the
info-sphere.]{.underline}

In the connected world, the retroactive loops of general systems theory
are fused with the dynamic logic of biogenetics to form a post-human
vision of digital production. [Human minds and flesh are integrated with
digital circuits thanks to interfaces of acceleration and
simplification: a model of bio-info production is emerging that produces
semiotic artefacts with the capacity for the auto- replication of living
systems. Once fully operative, the digital nervous system can be rapidly
installed in every form of organization.]{.underline}

[The digital network is provoking an intensification of the
info-stimuli, and these are transmitted from the social brain to
individual brains]{.underline}. This **[acceleration is a pathogenic
factor that has wide-ranging effects in society.]{.underline}** Since
capitalism is wired into the social brain, [a psychotic meme of
acceleration acts as pathological agent: the organism is **drawn into a
spasm until collapse**]{.underline}.

#### The bourgeoisie has disappeared: in the regime of semiocapitalism, there's nothing to rebel against. Their replacement, the "elsewhere class," engages in a constant reterritorialization of random financial value that makes effective resistance impossible. 

**Bifo 15** \[Francesco 'Bifo' Berardi, Professor of Social History of
Communication at the Accademia di Belle Arti of Milan, *Heroes: Mass

Semiocapital and the Ethics of Baroque

Crime used to be a secret act. In the age of repression and
industriousness, when the morality of the bourgeoisie was reigning,
crime wanted to be secret. Law aimed at preventing crime, and it
encouraged investigations of criminals in order to punish them.

This order of things has irrevocably changed in the last turn of time,
especially since the advent of the semiocapitalist regime.

[Semiocapitalism occupies the sphere of randomness of value, as well as
the sphere of **randomness of law** and of moral judgement]{.underline}.

[The entire strategy of the system lies in this **hyper-reality of
floating values**]{.underline}. It is the same for money and theory as
for the unconscious. [Value rules according to an ungraspable
order]{.underline}: [the generation of models]{.underline}, [the
indefinite chaining of simulation]{.underline}. Cybernetic
operationality, the genetic code, [the random order of
mutations,]{.underline} [the principle of uncertainty]{.underline}, and
so on: all of [these replace a determinist and objectivist science, a
dialectical vision of history and consciousness]{.underline}.1

Baudrillard is talking of value in economic terms. In the post-Fordist
transition, the relation between work-time and value is jeopardized, as
immaterial production and cognitive work are difficult to properly
gauge. But the random effect is not limited to the sphere of the
economy, as it spreads both to the sphere of social relations and to
that of ethics.

[The current, generalized perception of widespread corruption is neither
a superficial impression, nor the effect of a deterioration of the moral
character of people]{.underline}.

**[It is a systemic effect of the randomization of value]{.underline}**.
[When value can no longer be determined by the precise relation to
work-time]{.underline}, [its determinant factors]{.underline} [become
**deception**, **swindle**, **violence**]{.underline}. Mafia ceases to
be a marginal phenomenon of lawlessness, instead becoming the prevailing
force of emerging capitalist economies like Russia and Mexico. At the
same time, [fraud is legalized and organized in the global financial
market as a systemic feature]{.underline}.

As it becomes increasingly institutionalized, [crime loses its secrecy
and demands access to the spectacle]{.underline}. [The visibility of
crime becomes part of the effectiveness and persuasiveness of
power]{.underline}. [Competition is all about subduing, cheating,
predating]{.underline}. [Blaming the victims is part of the
game]{.underline}: [you are guilty of your inability to subdue,
to]{.underline} [cheat and to plunder]{.underline}, [therefore you will
be submitted to the blackmail of debt and to the tyranny of
austerity]{.underline}.

Nazism already enacted spectacular crime as a means to secure absolute
power, but the criminal acts conducted in the name of the 'Final
Solution' were secretly organized and performed away from the public
eye. [Evil was proclaimed and simultaneously denied in the name of the
superior values of family, homeland and God]{.underline}. [On the
contrary, reclaiming evil has become commonplace in today's financial
markets, as the old ethics of bourgeois Protestantism is progressively
cancelled by the]{.underline} [neobaroque, post-bourgeois ethics of the
deterritorialized financial class.]{.underline}

The bourgeoisie was a strongly territorialized class, whose power was
based on the property of physical assets, and on the fact of belonging
to a stable community. Protestant ethics was based on the long-lasting
relationship between the religious community and the labourers and
consumers who shared the same place and the same destiny.

Nowadays, **[the bourgeoisie has disappeared]{.underline}**. The
financial deterritorialization is generating a post-bourgeois class,
which has no relation to the territory and to community.

It is a class that is not concerned with the future of any specific
territorial community, because tomorrow it will move its business to a
different part of the world. We might call it [the 'elsewhere
class']{.underline}, as it [continuously displaces the stakes of its
investment]{.underline}. But [we may also call it a 'virtual
class']{.underline}, for two reasons: [because it is the class that
gains profits from virtual activities, like net trading, and high tech
immaterial production]{.underline}; and because it is the class that
does not actually [exist. Identifying those who are investing in the
financial market is difficult, impossible, as everybody is obliged to
depend on it.]{.underline}

In a sense, [everybody is part of the class that is investing in the
financial market]{.underline}. Including myself. [As a teacher I am
bound to wait for a pension, and I know that my pension will be paid if
some investment funds will be profitable, therefore I am obliged to
depend for my **future revenue** on the **profitability of the financial
market**]{.underline}. **[The 'elsewhere class']{.underline}** [has
re-established the economic rationale of the rentier, as profit is no
longer linked to the expansion of the existing wealth, but is linked to
the mere possession of an invisible asset]{.underline}: money, or, more
accurately, credit.

According to Thomas Stewart:

[Money has dematerialized]{.underline}. [Once upon a time officials of
the Federal Reserve Bank]{.underline} of New York [were loading gold
bars onto trolleys and rolled them from one]{.underline} [country's
basement to another. Today some 1.3 trillion in currency is traded every
day, and never takes a tangible form.]{.underline}

[Money has turned ethereal, volatile and electronic]{.underline}.
[Nothing more than an assemblage of ones and zeros that are piped
through miles of wire, pumped over fiberoptic]{.underline}
[highways]{.underline}, [bounced off satellites, and beamed from one
microwave relay station to another.]{.underline} [This new money is like
a shadow]{.underline}. It has no tactile dimension, no heft or weight.
[Money is an image.]{.underline}2

[The **post-bourgeois class of virtual finance has no homeland, no
community, no belonging, and also no money**. Just faith. Faith in
signs, in figures. The post-bourgeois class announces the return of the
baroque.]{.underline}

Although defeated and marginalized during the age of bourgeois progress
and the rational organization of social life, the baroque has never
disappeared.

[Its spirit is based on the primacy of the spectacle, on the
multiplication of possible interpretations, on randomness of value and
of meaning, or the potency of **arbitrary** and **violent
will**]{.underline}. Not surprisingly, Curzio Malaparte, a writer who
took part in Italian Fascism before changing his position during the
Second World War, in Europa vivente, published in 1925, speaks of
Italian Fascism as a return of the baroque. Northern Europeans are wrong
to think that modernity is only a Protestant business, says Malaparte.
Fascism is the reclaiming of the modern soul of Southern Europeans, and
the political spectacle of Mussolini is the resurgence of the baroque
cult of inessentiality, decoration, excess: arbitrary power.

But [arbitrariness is not only a **defining feature** of Fascism, it is
also the **quintessential character** of the **semio capitalist** form
of **accumulation**]{.underline}. The power of the resurgent baroque is
[fully exposed by the transformation of the economy into
**semioproduction**]{.underline}. [When **language**, **imagination**,
**information** and **immaterial flows**]{.underline} [become the force
of production and the general space of exchange]{.underline}, [when
property is deterritorialized and becomes immaterial]{.underline}, [the
**baroque spirit** becomes the all-encompassing form, both of the
economy and of ethical discourse]{.underline}.

### 2ac anti-blackness turns

#### The freedom of the anti-capitalist worker is premised upon a denial of blackness because it remains on the terrain of beings. Their claim to produce freedom for blackness relies on a vicious ruse of analogy that re-elaborates on the conditions of slavery. 

**[Barber]{.underline}** (Daniel Colucciello, Department Member ICI
Berlin Institute for Cultural Inquiry) **[2016]{.underline}** (The
Creation of Non-Being, Rhizome, Issue 29,
<http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html>, C.A.)

\[28\] This is to name the essential limit of Lazzarato\'s account as
the failure to analyze the ways in which the domination of **[capitalism
is constituted by]{.underline}** the domination of
**[anti-blackness]{.underline}**. In making this claim, I am following
Wilderson\'s argument that \"the privileged subject of Marxist discourse
is a subaltern who is approached by variable capital---a wage. In other
words, Marxism assumes a subaltern structured by capital, not by white
supremacy\" (Wilderson 2003: 225). The essential limit of Marxism, he
argues, is its theorization of capitalism in terms of \"exploitation
(rather than accumulation and death)\" (Wilderson 2003: 234).
**[Marxism]{.underline}** thus begins from and **[stays within the being
of whiteness]{.underline}**, a being whose coherence is premised on the
denial of the fact that capital \"was **[kick-started by approaching
a]{.underline}** particular body (a **[Black body]{.underline}**)
**[with direct relations of force, not by approaching a White body with
variable capital\"]{.underline}** (Wilderson 2003: 230). \[29\] The
position of the worker, in virtue of its raced difference from the
position of the slave, asserts a capacity for analogical relation---even
amidst exploitation---with the exploiter. The exploited and the
exploiter, despite their asymmetry, share a being that is made through
the denial of blackness, which is positioned as the slave; the worker
possesses an analogical relation to the owner that the slave does not.
**[To presume that the slave]{.underline}** position **[can be
analogized with the worker]{.underline}** position **[is
thus]{.underline}** to attribute the latter\'s analogical capacity to
the former, which is without analogy. It is to presume an analogy
between what is capable of being analogous with what is not: **[\"the
ruse of analogy\"]{.underline}** (Wilderson 2010: 37). \[30\] This
means, as well, that **[there can be no question of an
intersection]{.underline}** between separate but equal spheres of class
and anti-black racism, much less of an account that takes up
anti-blackness as a means of proceeding toward a supposedly essential
antagonism of class. Against such accounts, Wilderson remarks that,
within them, \"racism is read off the base, as it were, as being
derivative of political economy\" (Wilderson 2003: 225). On the
contrary, what is essential is anti-black racism, or the
incommensurability between non-being and being: class division concerns
relations between analogizable terms (owner and worker) that, however
conflictual or exploitative, presume a common being, a being whose
making---and being made coherent---is premised on (the denial of) the
real non-being of the slave. \[31\] All this is to say that anti-black
racial ontology is the condition of possibility for the Marxist
demand---central to Lazzarato\'s own version of autonomist Marxism---for
being free from exploitation. As Christina Sharpe remarks: \"The legal
captivity of Africans and their descendants was central to the
codification of rights and freedoms for those legally constituted as
white and their legally white descendants. That is, freedoms for those
people constituted as white were and are produced through an other\'s
body legally and otherwise being made to wear unfreedom and to serve as
a placeholder for access to the freedoms that are denied the black
subject\" (Sharpe 2010: 15). The being of freedom, or the articulation
of a free being -- that is, **[the very link between being and
freedom---is premised upon a denial of blackness]{.underline}**, or
non-being. This is the case even (or especially) when freedom is
expressed as a possibility, for such possibility---pertaining only to
that which has already emerged as being---cannot articulate that which
this emergence denies. As Saidiya V. Hartman remarks, **[the \"language
of freedom]{.underline}** no longer **[becomes]{.underline}** that which
rescues the slave from his or her former condition, but **[the site of
the re-elaboration of that condition]{.underline}**\" (Hartman and
Wilderson 2003: 185). \[32\] **[Freedom names the modulative, mutational
possibilities of being(s]{.underline}**). **[Marxist discourse, however
innovative, addresses free beings, or the being of freedom. It leaves
unthought non-being, the reality of which is logically prior to all
being, and thus to all possibilities of being.]{.underline}** It is for
this reason that **[Lazzarato\'s account of capitalism in terms of debt,
while an extremely innovative form of contemporary Marxism, still fails
to articulate the essential antagonism of
non-being]{.underline}**.[\[17\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-17)
When Lazzarato speaks of the indebted man, of the \"we\" of debt
inheritance, he is speaking of the position that Marxism ascribes to the
worker---instead of a capital-work relation we have, in Lazzarato, a
credit-debt
relation.[\[18\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-18)
Debt innovatively re-defines the meaning of work, but it does not change
the positionality of the worker, which remains as the position of the
debtor.[\[19\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-19)
His critique proceeds in virtue of a link---foreclosed by debt---between
being and freedom, without ever articulating that the very possibility
of this link is premised on the denial of non-being, on the making of
blackness as that which is without the possibility of being free.
Lazzarato thereby fails to address how the being of the worker, now the
indebted man, is rendered visible by standing out against the background
of (black)
flesh.[\[20\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-20)

#### The focus on exploitation of the worker cannot grapple with black non-being because exploitation occurs through the inheritance of debt which presumes a being which has the capacity to inherit. It is precisely through this capacity that the worker can still identify with the "we" of humanity. 

**[Barber]{.underline}** (Daniel Colucciello, Department Member ICI
Berlin Institute for Cultural Inquiry) **[2016]{.underline}** (The
Creation of Non-Being, Rhizome, Issue 29,
<http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html>, C.A.)

\[17\] **[A central feature of control is debt]{.underline}**. As
Deleuze remarks, \"A man is no longer a man confined but a man in debt\"
(Deleuze 1997: 179). The experience of the indebted man is one of
endless postponement, for the creditor-debtor relation sets the terms,
in the present, for the future of this relation. Otherwise put, the
relation between present and future is circumscribed within the relation
between creditor and debtor: to have credit is to have the future as a
present creditor; to have debt is to have the future as a present
debtor. The future is given credit by the present, or the future is what
one is given to pay off the debt of the present. In such a relation,
**[the future is endlessly postponed while the present remains, endures,
as credit and debt. Any negativity toward the present is
foreclosed]{.underline}**, and so the future is never created. \[18\]
Yet Deleuze\'s analysis of control, and thereby of debt, is inchoate.
For this reason, it will be useful to turn to the arguments set forth in
Lazzarato\'s recent text, The Making of the Indebted Man, which offers a
thoroughgoing development of the insights of Deleuze\'s analysis. The
usefulness of this text arises, additionally, from the fact that
Lazzarato---unlike many who work in a Deleuzian vein---tends to avoid
dependence on an ineliminable excess of being that is presumed to
overcome the limits of the present. Rather than treat Deleuze\'s thought
as the index of an indefatigable, constitutive power of being that
guarantees political possibility, **[Lazzarato attends to the ways in
which control has foreclosed such possibility]{.underline}**. As such,
Lazzarato is perhaps the best available candidate for **[exemplifying
Deleuzian thought without the presumption of affirmation]{.underline}**.
\[19\] Lazzarato presents the indebted man as the subjective terrain of
communicative capitalism\'s apparatus of control, and in doing so
develops some of Deleuze\'s central claims. For instance, he observes
how debt \"preempts non-chronological time, each person\'s future as
well as the future of society as a whole,\" and contends that debt is
the \"principal explanation for the strange sensation of living in a
society without time, without possibility, without foreseeable rupture\"
(Lazzarato 2012: 46-47). Furthermore, he confirms that debt marks the
appearance of capitalism\'s capacity to make being as such, and thus to
make the future: \"The power of capitalism, like the world it aims to
appropriate and control, is always in the process of being made\"
(Lazzarato 2012: 107). \[20\] **[Lazzarato offers a key advance on
Deleuze with his emphasis on the aforementioned being-making capacity of
capitalism]{.underline}**. Specifically, he insists that **[debt is not
a scientific necessity]{.underline}**---something that stems from
autonomous economic laws---**[but rather a product of
power]{.underline}**. Debt belongs to the exercise of power, and as such
it is a making of beings that are logically prior to---and thus do not
gain their coherence through---any science of economy. \"Measure,
evaluation, and appraisal\"---the means by which debt expresses and
constructs itself---\"all arise from the question of power, before there
is any question of economics\" (Lazzarato 2012: 80). It is in virtue of
the centrality of power within his analysis that Lazzarato offers an
additional advance: the claim that attention to the debt-relation is
inseparable from attention to the Christian relation. The power at
issue, Lazzarato argues, is one in which the \"origin of valuation and
measure is both religious and political\" (Lazzarato 2012: 81). \[21\]
Lazzarato\'s theorization of **[capitalism as a power to make the
debt-relation]{.underline}**---and not as a secular science regulating
this relation---**[leads him to introduce and emphasize the Christian
valence of \"debt obligations]{.underline}**\" (Lazzarato 2012: 40-41).
He argues that what makes the debt-relation hold (as its necessary, if
not sufficient, condition) is obligation, and that the theorization of
this obligation requires attending to the Christian character of debt.
Being is made through the establishment of a creditor-debtor relation,
yet **[essential to this relation is the establishment of
obligation]{.underline}**, and obligation, Lazzarato argues, is
**[established by Christianity]{.underline}** (from which capitalism
inherits it). Simply put, the making of beings through debt is made
through obligation, which is made through Christianity. It is along
these lines that he claims **[we are now \"indebted to the \'god\'
Capital\"]{.underline}** (Lazzarato 2012: 32). Lazzarato\'s analysis of
the debt-relation thereby demonstrates that the power by which
capitalism makes being is bound up with a power named by Christianity.
Capitalist power must then be analyzed in its undividedness from
Christian power, and in a way that attends to the negativity of
non-being against being. Asymmetry as Analogy \[22\] One way of
addressing this task is to think debt as inheritance---that is, to think
the inheritance of Christian debt by capitalism, and in doing so to
think how **[a capacity of being is inherited by capitalism from
Christianity]{.underline}**. We inherit debt, and debt requires that our
future be inherited---ahead of time---as the debt enacted in the
present. But it is not just that debt is inherited, it is also that
**[debt constitutes its inheritors as]{.underline}** something, as
beings analogically **[belonging to a \"we.\"]{.underline}** Note, for
instance, the collective first-person of Lazzarato\'s claim: \"We are no
longer the inheritors of original sin but rather of the debt of
preceding generations\" (Lazzarato 2012: 32). Who is \"we\"? \[23\] It
is by way of this question that one begins to encounter a limit of
Lazzarato\'s analysis, which I will address in a logical register before
returning to the explicitly historical marks of the inheritance that he
tracks. **[This limit]{.underline}**, logically speaking, **[is
Lazzarato\'s focus on asymmetry]{.underline}**. He clearly observes the
injustice of the debt-relation by articulating the deep asymmetry
between creditor and
debtor.[\[11\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-11)While
this observation is not incorrect, the approach to which it belongs
ignores the ways in which **[asymmetry remains within
being]{.underline}**. In order for one thing to be communicated as
asymmetrical with or disproportionate to another thing, these things
must be analogical to one another, possessing a minimal degree of
likeness or commonality. Therefore creditor and debtor, despite the
extremity of their asymmetry, remain analogous to each other as beings.
\[24\] This is to say that the debt-relation operates as a domain of
analogous being, and that **[Lazzarato]{.underline}**---by presupposing
and leaving in place this domain---**[fails to encounter the negativity
of
non-being]{.underline}**.[\[12\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-12)[Whereas
asymmetry presupposes the commonality and analogical relation of beings,
non-being names that which is without being, and thus without analogical
relation to being]{.underline}(s): **[something and nothing are not
asymmetrical but incommensurable]{.underline}**. Lazzarato\'s critique
of debt, by focusing on asymmetry, ignores this absence of analogy
between being (whether positive or negative, creditor or debtor) and
non-being, and so it can only amount to a modulation of being---that is,
a modulation ofwe. \[25\] Returning to Lazzarato\'s history of
Christian-capitalist inheritance, I contend that this modulation is
evident as an apparent transmutation within the \"we\": we were **[once
the inheritors of original sin]{.underline}**, whereas we are **[now the
inheritors of debt.]{.underline}** Yet a deeper continuity remains, for
while we are different, it is we who have undergone---and
survived---discontinuity: **[we are still we]{.underline}**. Previously
we inherited original sin, whereas now we inherit debt, but we are still
those who inherit---and, in virtue of this being-inherited or
inheriting-being, we are something. We are we, and we remain we, across
any apparent discontinuity of Christianity and capitalism, **[because
what remains]{.underline}**, what is constant, **[is the capacity to
inherit]{.underline}**. Such inheritance is not so happy, of course, for
to inherit sin, or to inherit debt, is to be exploited by God or
capital. Yet this structure of exploitation maintains an analogy between
exploiter and exploited: we are exploited, but **[precisely through this
exploitation]{.underline}**, this inheritance of debt, we still know
ourselves as we. \[26\] In this sense, \"we\" names the inherited
capacity to be-something, or the capacity to inherit being. What is
ultimately inherited is not debt so much as this capacity: the debt that
exploits is the debt that gives being, that gives the capacity to be in
analogy with other beings, and thus to participate in or communicate as
we. To frame the inheritance of debt primarily in terms of its asymmetry
or exploitation is thus to obscure the fact that inheritability, or the
ability to inherit, is the common or communicable being underlying all
asymmetry. This is to say that **[Lazzarato focuses]{.underline}** his
analysis **[on the conflictual relation between beings of the anti-black
world and thereby fails to address the more essential antagonism between
blackness and the world]{.underline}**. Lazzarato remains within the
being of inheritance, or within the we that underlies and guarantees the
\"coherence\"[\[13\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-13)
(Hartman and Wilderson 2003: 187) of asymmetrical relation, whereas
**[any break with the present]{.underline}** must be articulated
according to blackness, which is without relation. \[27\] The break,
then, **[must be articulated according to the uninheritability of
blackness]{.underline}**. For Lazzarato, however, blackness remains in
\"the position of the unthought\" (Hartman and Wilderson 2003: 185), and
this is precisely because he adheres to the universalizable horizon of
the we. \"Everyone is a \'debtor,\' accountable to and guilty before.
Capital has become the Great Creditor, the Universal Creditor\"
(Lazzarato 2012:
11).[\[14\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-14)
Yet it is clear that there are those who do not participate in the we of
the indebted
man.[\[15\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-15)
Logically prior to the domination articulated via asymmetrical relations
of we (inheritance of debt), there is domination articulated as
non-being: \"the damned of the
earth\"[\[16\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-16)
do not inherit.

#### Their move to call us individualistic masks the whites as the collective and demonize people who challenge racial and sexual violence -- that allows that violence to continue and reifies neoliberalism

**Ahmed in 14** \<Sara. Professor of Race and Cultural Studies,
Goldsmiths College, University of London. "Selfcare as welfare" August
25, 2014. http://feministkilljoys.com/2014/08/25/selfcare-as-warfare/\>

Audre Lorde writes persuasively about how self-care can become an
obscurant, how caring for oneself can lead you away from engaging in
certain kinds of political struggle. And yet, in A Burst of Light, she
defends self-care as not about self-indulgence, but self-preservation.
[Self-care becomes warfare. This kind of self-care is not about one's
own happiness. It is about finding ways to exist in a world that is
diminishing.]{.underline} Already: [we have been given some tools to
sharpen our understanding of how neo-liberalism can be used as a tool.
There are differences that matter, differences that matter relating to
differences of power. Neoliberalism sweeps up too much when all forms of
self-care become symptoms of neo-liberalism. When feminist, queer and
anti-racist work that involves sharing our feelings, our hurt and grief,
recognising that power gets right to the bone, is called neo-liberalism,
we have to hear what is not being heard. When feminism involves
recognising the suffering of say, an individual woman of colour at the
hands of a sexist, heterosexist, and racist system that is indifferent
to the suffering it causes and that is called neoliberalism, you would
be repeating rather than challenging this structural
indifference]{.underline}. And you also negate other "other histories"
that are at stake in her struggle for her suffering to matter. [Those
who do not have to struggle for their own survival can very easily and
rather quickly dismiss those who have to struggle for survival as
"indulging themselves."]{.underline} As feminism teaches us: **[talking
about personal feelings is not necessarily about deflecting attention
from structures]{.underline}**. If anything, I would argue the opposite:
**[not addressing certain histories that hurt, histories that get to the
bone, how we are affected by what we come up against, is one way of
deflecting attention from structures]{.underline}** (as if our concern
with our own pain or suffering is what stops certain things from just
"going away"). Not the only way, but one way. If you have got a model
that says an individual woman who is trying to survive an experience of
rape by focusing on her own wellbeing and safety, by trying to work out
ways she can keep on going or ways she can participate in something
without having to experience more trauma (by asking for trigger warnings
in a classroom, for instance) is participating in the same politics as a
woman who is concerned with getting up "the ladder" in a company then I
think there is something wrong with your model. [Sometimes, "coping
with" or "getting by" or "making do" might appear as a way of not
attending to structural inequalities, as benefiting from a system by
adapting to it, even if you are not privileged by that system, even if
you are damaged by that system]{.underline}. Perhaps we need to ask: who
has enough resources not to have to become resourceful? When you have
less resources you might have to become more resourceful. Of course: the
requirement to become more resourceful is part of the the injustice of a
system that distributes resources unequally. Of course: becoming
resourceful is not system changing even if it can be life changing
(although maybe, just maybe, a collective refusal not to not exist can
be system changing). But [to assume people's ordinary ways of coping
with injustices implies some sort of failure on their part -- or even an
identification with the system -- is another injustice they have to cope
with. The more resources you have the easier it is to make such a
critique of those whose response to injustice is to become more
resourceful.]{.underline} You might not be trying to move up, to project
yourself forward; you might simply be trying not to be brought down.
Heavy, heavy histories. Wearing, worn down. Even if it's system change
we need, that we fight for, when the system does not change, when the
walls come up, those hardenings of history into physical barriers in the
present, you have to manage; to cope. Your choices are compromised when
a world is compromised. [It is not surprising: some recent
anti-feminist, anti-queer and anti-intersectionality (intersectionality
as code for people of colour) statements from the "white male left" rest
on charging us with being individualistic, as indulging ourselves, as
being concerned with ourselves and our own damaged
"identities]{.underline}." I wonder if Audre Lorde might have had to
insist that self-care was not self-indulgence because she had heard this
charge. I wonder. I have read recently some critiques of feminists for
calling out individuals for sexism and racism because those critiques
neglect (we neglect) structures. Really? Or is that when we talk about
sexism and racism you hear us as talking about individuals? Are you
suddenly concerned with structures because you do not want to hear how
you as an individual might be implicated in the power relations we
critique? I noted in my book, On Being Included (2012) how there can be
a certain safety in terms like "institutional racism" in a context where
individuals have disidentified from institutions they can see themselves
as not "in it" at all. And how interesting: the individual disappears at
the very moment he is called to account. He will probably reappear as
the saviour of the left. You can hear, no doubt, my tiredness and
cynicism. I do not apologise for it. I am tired of it. Some of the glib
dismissals of "call out culture" make my blood boil. I say glib because
they imply it is easy to call people out, or even that it has become a
new social norm. I know, for instance, how hard it is to get sexual
harassment taken seriously. Individuals get away with it all the time.
They get away with it because of the system. It is normalised and
understood as the way things are. Individual women have to speak out,
and testify over and over again; and still there is a system in place, a
system that is working, that stops women from being heard. In a case
when a woman is harassed by an individual man, she has to work hard to
call him out. She often has to keep saying it because he keeps doing it.
Calling out an individual matters, even when the system is also what is
bruising: the violence directed against you by somebody is a violence
that leaves a trace upon you whether that trace is visible or not. And:
there is a system which creates him, supports him, and gives him a sense
that he has a right to do what he does. To challenge him is to challenge
a system. I read one anti-feminist article that implied feminists are
being individualistic, when they call out individual men, because that
calling out is what stops us working more collectively for radical
transformation. [**Collectivity: can work for some individuals as a
means for disguising their own interest as collective interest**. When
collectivity requires you to bracket your experience of oppression **it
is not a collectivity worth fighting for**]{.underline}. And I have
watched this happen with feminist despair: [when women speak out about
sexual harassment and sexual violence they are heard as compromising the
whole thing: a project, a centre, a revolution. And the individuals they
speak of are then presented as the ones]{.underline} who have to suffer
the consequences of feminist complaint, the one's [whose damage is
generalised (if "he" is damaged "we" are damaged). When her testimony is
heard as damaging the possibility of revolting against a system, **a
system is reproduced**.]{.underline} I will say it again: the individual
seems to disappear at the moment he is called to account. We are the
ones who then appear as individuals, who are assumed to be acting as
individuals or even as being individualistic, while he disappears into a
collective. From my study of will and willfulness, I learnt how [those
who challenge power are often judged as promoting themselves, as putting
themselves first, as self-promotional]{.underline}. And maybe: the
judgment does find us somewhere. We might have to promote ourselves when
we are not promoted by virtue of our membership of a group. We might
have to become assertive just to appear. For others, you appear and you
are attended to right away. A world is waiting for you to appear. The
one who can quickly disappear when called to account can then quickly
re-appear when on the receiving end of an action that is welcomed or
desired. I think of these differences as how we become assembled over
and by tables. Two women seated together at a table, let's say.
Sometimes you might have to wave your arm, your willful arm, just to be
noticed. Without a man at the table you tend not to appear. For others,
to be seated is not only to be seen, but to be seen to. You can take up
a place at the table when you have already been given a place. You do
not have to become self-willed if your will is accomplished by the
general will. This is why the general dismissal of feminism as identity
politics (and there is a history to how identity politics becomes a
dismissal) needs to be treated as a form of conservatism: it is an
attempt to conserve power by assuming those who challenge power are just
concerned with or about themselves. An individual is one who is not
dividable into parts. [In Willful Subjects (2014), I tied the history of
the individual as the one who does not have to divide himself to a
patriarchal, colonial and capitalist history. He can be an individual,
not divided into parts, because others become his parts: they become his
arms, his feet, his hands, limbs that are intended to give support to
his body.]{.underline} When a secretary becomes his right hand, his
right hand is freed. Your labour as support for his freedom. This is how
the question of support returns us to bodies, to how bodies are
supported. Willful parts are those who are unwilling to provide this
support. So how quickly those who resist their subordination are judged
as being individualistic as well as willful. In refusing to support him,
by becoming his parts, we have become self-willed; in refusing to care
for him, we are judged as caring for ourselves, where this "for" is
assumed as only and lonely. **[Self-care: that can be an act of
political warfare]{.underline}**. In directing our care towards
ourselves we are redirecting care away from its proper objects, we are
not caring for those we are supposed to care for; we are not caring for
the bodies deemed worth caring about. And [that is why in queer,
feminist and anti-racist work self-care is about the creation of
community]{.underline}, fragile communities, [assembled out of the
experiences of being shattered. We reassemble ourselves through the
ordinary, everyday and often painstaking work of looking after
ourselves; looking after each other.]{.underline} This is why when we
have to insist, I matter, we matter, we are transforming what matters.
Women's lives matter; black lives matter; queer lives matter; disabled
lives matter; trans lives matter; the poor; the elderly; the
incarcerated, matter**[. For those who have to insist they matter to
matter: selfcare is warfare.]{.underline}**

#### It also means the alt fails because reading racist and sexist violence as extrinsic effects of capital alienates people from the proletariat movement against capitalism

**Belkhir in 1** \<Jean Ait. "Marxism Without Apologies: Integrating
Race, Gender, Class; A Working Class Approach" Race, Gender & Class8.2
(Apr 30, 2001): 142.\>

[More than ever there is a need for the continued struggle against
historical social inequalities based on race, class and
gender]{.underline}. We need to integrate racism, sexism and classism
into the Marxist analysis of capitalism [in which race or gender or
class serves as a point of entry through which the varied forms of
social inequality can and must be understood]{.underline}. Thus, [in
recognizing the centrality of race, gender and class issues in the
struggle against economic inequality and exploitation and cultural
subordination and domination, we will be able to avoid the dramatic
mistakes of the past that considered racism, sexism and classism as
divisive issues.¶]{.underline} Marxism and the \"Woman Question\"¶ In
their article Marxist Theory and the Oppression of Women, Morrissey &
Stoecker (1994) argue \"those who follow Marx and Engels are left with a
Marxist theory that is ambiguous on whether the source of women\'s
oppression might be independent of the source of capitalism and whether
this oppression could be ended by ending capitalism alone.\" Feminism
often suggests that [Marxism produced virtually nothing of real
usefulness about gender inequality and the liberation of
women]{.underline}. For Vogel (1983): \"[Marx and his collaborator
Engels had little to say about the emancipation of women\.... For them
it was a marginal problem.\" As a result, the sexist bias in Marxism
contributed to the growth of distortions in their analysis of
capitalism]{.underline}. In her famous article entitled: The Unhappy
Marriage of Marxism and Feminism: Towards a More Progressive Union,
Hartman (1981) argued that: \"The marriage of Marxism and feminism has
been like the marriage of husband and wife depicted in English common
law: Marxism and feminism are one, and that one is Marxism.\" As such
feminists argued (e.g., Hartman, 1981), [since capital and private
property do not cause the inequality of women, **their abolition alone
will not result in the end of gender inequality**]{.underline}. Only
specifically feminist analysis revealed the systemic character of the
patriarchal relations between men and women necessary to understand
gender inequality.¶ Most women writing on feminism began with the
central notion that there was a distinction between sex and gender and
argued that \"women\" were not born, but made: the problem was culture,
not nature that were at the center of women\'s so-called inferiority.
Other feminist writers also argued that the end of capitalism or
patriarchy would not necessarily end the objectification and
\"subordination\" of women because the control was within culture and
the unconscious. Some feminist theorists believe that the gender
hierarchical system is more deeply embedded in the male ego and thus,
the various changes in the social order have remained male dominated,
whether capitalist, socialist, fascist, communist, authoritarian, or
liberal. Central to the reproduction of the [\"inferiorisation of
women\" is the socialization process of children outside and inside the
home where \"the patriarchal ideology, that men are superior to women,\"
are]{.underline} taught and, where the inferior position of women is
[reinforced by the churches, unions, armies, factories, offices, media,
publicity, schools, etc]{.underline}. The extensive list of practices,
such as clitoridectomy, infibulation, prostitution, pornography, rape,
foot-banding, body-veiling, involuntary sterilization, and sex-object
advertising, illustrate the unequal power relationship of women to men,
and finally, modern Asia\'s anomaly; the girls who do not get born.¶
MARXISM AND THE \"RACE PROBLEM.\"¶ Although much contemporary
sociological writing concerns itself with analyses of race, theories of
racial ethnic inequality have never been a priority in Marxist social
science. As Geschwender & Levine (1994) reminds us: \"[Classical social
theorists, such as Marx, Durkheim, and Weber, were not concerned with
the race problem]{.underline}\...The authors conclude their reviews of
Classical and Recent Theoretical Developments in the Marxist Analysis of
Race and Ethnicity in regretting that certain [Marxist theorists make
the error of denying the race problem in the U.S.]{.underline} For
instance, Bonacich (1980) [reduced racism to an **ideological adjunct to
class exploitation.**]{.underline} Wallerstein (1972) came very close to
eliminating the concept together by stripping it of any meaning
independent of the exploitation process.¶ As consequence, Manning
Marable (1996) argues that [racism has blunted the critical faculties of
white progressives from the colonial period to the present Blacks have
seen an endless series of prominent white liberal and progressive allies
**betray their trust and embrace the politics of white
supremacy**.]{.underline} Marxists have always insisted that the flow of
social history is determined by the relationship between subjective and
objective factors \-- the superstructure or ideological, cultural, and
political apparatuses and the base, or forces of production. But what
most American progressives and Marxists adhered to was a philosophy not
of [Marxism]{.underline} \-- which also [suggests that the relations
between superstructure and base are]{.underline} reciprocal, each
affecting the other \-- but [of economic determinism. Racism
was,]{.underline} therefore, [only part of the larger class question.
Small wonder, then, that until today, **no progressive or Marxist white
organizations**, Old Left or New, **had won over any significant number
of black and people of color activists, intellectuals, or
workers.**]{.underline}

### 2ac left melancholy turn

#### The negative's nostalgia for an anti-capitalism before post structuralism is left melancholy \-- causes more political inaction

**Dean 14** \[*Contemporary Political Theory*, 4 November 2014,
"Radicalism restored? Communism and the end of left melancholia,"
Jonathan, School of Politics and International Studies, University of
Leeds\]

\- The left likes to blame capitalism on everything and then we don't
know how to come up with effective resistances outside of cap (fem,
queer, etc.) leads to clogging because we can only think in terms of
capitalism

The use of melancholia as an analytical category has its roots in
Freudian psychoanalysis, and is to be distinguished from the related
concept of mourning. For Freud, the latter refers to the
(non-pathological) process of working through an acknowledged 'loss of a
loved person, or of some abstraction which has taken the place of one,
such as one's country, liberty, an ideal, and so on' (Freud, 2001, p.
243). Crucially, after a period of mourning is completed 'the ego
becomes free and uninhibited again' (2001, p. 243) but melancholia, by
contrast, is 'related to an object loss that is withdrawn from
consciousness' (2001, p. 245), and as such it remains unacknowledged,
enduring and intransigent. A number of authors have argued that Freud's
distinction between mourning and melancholia can help capture something
specific about the affects and dispositions of the academic left. Wendy
Brown's 1999 essay 'Resisting Left Melancholy' remains the
standard-bearer. Drawing on Freud, Walter Benjamin and Stuart Hall,
Brown argues that the left-wing melancholic is 'attached more to a
particular political analysis or ideal -- even to the failure of that
ideal -- than to seizing possibilities for radical change in the
present' (Brown, 1999, p. 20). [Left-wing melancholy,]{.underline} says
Brown, '[signifies a certain narcissism with regard to one's past
political]{.underline} [attachments and identity that exceeds any
contemporary investment in political mobilization, alliance or
transformation]{.underline}' (1999, p. 20). But [what precisely is it
that has brought about this pervasive left-wing melancholy?]{.underline}
Brown's answer is twofold. First, she argues that [the discourse of the
left-wing melancholic frequently cites the turn to]{.underline}
so-called 'cultural politics' or '[identity politics']{.underline} -- in
[which]{.underline} struggles around gender, race and sexuality [are
seen to have displaced the traditional focus on class]{.underline} -- as
having caused a crisis and loss of focus (1999, p. 23). [The second
alleged culprit]{.underline} -- in the eyes of the left-wing melancholic
-- [is the turn to 'poststructuralism,]{.underline} [discourse analysis,
postmodernism, trendy literary theory]{.underline} [got up as political
analysis']{.underline} (1999, p. 23). Brown argues that [this
**pervasive** structure of **left-wing melancholy**,]{.underline}
[despite being based on an ostensible commitment to radical
transformation]{.underline}, in fact **[engenders a conservative refusal
to engage critically]{.underline}** and constructively [with the
world]{.underline}. Instead, [the left-wing melancholic takes refuge
in]{.underline} his or her **[attachments to a lost ideal of traditional
left theory and politics]{.underline}**. [The crucial point]{.underline}
for Brown [is that the problems affecting the academic left do
not]{.underline} -- as the left-wing melancholic would have it -- [arise
from the left's abandonment of its radical principles. Rather, this
melancholia arises from many leftists' continued]{.underline} (often
unacknowledged) [attachments to a historically specific model of
anti-capitalist revolutionary]{.underline} [social change, whose
privileged status is now called into question]{.underline}. [Left-wing
melancholia,]{.underline} for Brown, [is]{.underline} therefore **[bound
up with a generalised refusal]{.underline}** or inability [to respond
to]{.underline} the [challenges engendered by the changing nature of
capitalism]{.underline}, [and the emergence of]{.underline} various
forms of radical politics -- [feminism, queer politics,
anti-racism]{.underline} and so on -- [irreducible to historical
materialist models of political transformation]{.underline}.3 Brown's
text is notable for its lack of proper names, and as [such melancholia
is implicitly understood to refer to a collective, widely shared set of
investments and orientations]{.underline}. This aspect of left
melancholia is tackled in some detail in J.K. Gibson-Graham's (2006)
analysis of the affects and emotions of the academic left. One of
Gibson-Graham's central aims is to contest an entrenched mindset in
which 'the accepted or correct 'political' stance is one in which the
emotional and affective dispositions of paranoia, melancholia, and
moralism intermingle and self-reinforce' (2006, p. 4). Crucially, [these
negative affects are not located in particular individuals, but are a
'structure of feeling']{.underline} (2006, p. 1) ['widely present if not
fully manifest in any person or pronouncement]{.underline}' (2006, p.
6). Gibson-Graham suggests that [these structures of feeling reduce the
academic left to **political \[clogging\]**]{.underline}
~~paralysis~~[,]{.underline} [and also curtail our analytical
capacities]{.underline}: [left melancholia]{.underline}, they argue,
[reflects and reinforces]{.underline} rather **[crude, totalising
renditions of capitalism]{.underline}** as a pervasive and largely
uncontestable socio-economic formation. Consequently,
[complexities]{.underline} within capitalism, and socio-economic
practices [that diverge from]{.underline} -- or indeed actively resist
-- [capitalism, are downplayed, overlooked and cast to the
margins]{.underline}, [precluding the production of more nuanced
framings of contemporary economic practices and social
formations]{.underline}. The thrust of Brown and Gibson-Graham's
critical analyses of various aspects of left melancholia is not to
suggest that those on the academic left should simply cheer up, or
foster more positive affective orientations for the sake of it. Rather,
their point is that [melancholia]{.underline} -- conceived as a specific
kind of psychic formation different to, say, disappointment or sadness
-- **[hampers the academic left's ability]{.underline}** [to intervene
politically, or to engage in fruitful socio-political

#### This articulates itself in ways that are racist, sexist, and destroy alt solvency

Pleasuring Identity, or the Delicious Politics of Belonging," New
Literary History, Vol. 31, No. 4, pages 840-841\]

Although in his contribution Eric Lott targets Professor Michaels\'s
comments and his own recent feud with Timothy Brennan (who unfortunately
is not included in this volume) rather than Ken\'s argument, what Eric
says about "left and liberal fundamentalists" who "simply and somewhat
penitently" urge us to "'go back to class'" could also be directed at
Ken\'s conclusion. Ken writes, "Crafting a political left that does not
merely reflect existing racial divisions starts with the relatively
mundane proposition that it is possible to make a persuasive appeal to
the given interests of working and unemployed women and men, regardless
of race, in support of a program for economic justice." On this one, I
side with Eric, rather than Tim and Ken. Standing on the left depends on
whose left side we\'re talking about. My left might be your right and
vice versa, because it depends on what direction we\'re facing, and what
direction depends on which identities we\'re assuming and affirming.
Eric adds, \"Even in less dismissive \[than Tim\'s\] accounts of new
social movements based not on class but on identities formed by
histories of injustice, there is a striking a priori sense of
voluntarism about the investment in this cause or that movement or the
other issue---as though determining the most fundamental issue were a
matter of the writer\'s strength of feeling rather than a studied or
analytical sense of the ever-unstable balance of forces in a hegemonic
bloc at a given moment.\" I agree, but I\'ll risk mangling what Eric
says by putting it more crassly.[Touting class **or \"economic
justice\"**as the fundamental stance for left identity is just another
way of telling everybody else to shut up so I can be heard above the
fray. Because of the force of \"identity politics,\" a leftist white
person would be leery of claiming to lead Blacks toward the promised
land, a leftist straight man leery of claiming to lead women or queers,
but, for a number of complex rationalizations, we in the middle class
(where all of us writing here currently reside) still have few qualms
about volunteering to lead]{.underline}, at least theoretically, [the
working class toward \"economic justice.\" What Eric calls]{.underline}
here \"[left fundamentalism,\" I\'d call]{.underline}, at the risk of
sounding harsh, [left paternalism. **Of the big identity groups
articulated through \"identity politics,\" economic class remains the
only identity where a straight white middle-class man can still feel
comfortable claiming himself a leading political voice, and thus hemay
sometimes overcompensate by screaming that this is the only identity
that really matters---which is the same as claiming that class is beyond
identity**]{.underline}. Partly this is because**[Marxist
theory]{.underline}**and Marx himself (a bourgeois intellectual creating
the theoretical practice for the workers\' revolution) **[stage the
model for working-class identity as a sort of trans-identification, a
magical identity that is transferable to those outside the group who
commit themselves to it wholeheartedly enough]{.underline}**. If we look
back, we realize even this magical quality is not special to a history
of class struggle, as whites during the New Negro movements of the early
twentieth century felt that they were vanguard race leaders because they
had putatively imbibed some essential qualities of Negroness by
cross-identifying with the folk and their culture.

#### Markets solve sustainability and are the only way to solve warming

**Adler 22,** Jonathan H. Adler is the Johan Verheij Memorial Professor
of Law and Director of the Coleman Burke Center for Environmental Law at
the Case Western Reserve University School of Law; \"How Markets Make
Economic Growth Sustainable,\" Reason, 3-30-2022,

Accessed 7-4-2022, LASA-SC

Fifty years ago, researchers at MIT produced The Limits to Growth, a
report on how existing economic trends foretold environmental ruin. Left
unchecked, the [authors predicted]{.underline},
**[expanding]{.underline}** populations and economic
**[growth]{.underline}** [would exhaust global resources
and]{.underline} ultimately [prompt]{.underline} **[civilizational
collapse]{.underline}**. The models upon which Limits was based
suggested that global reserves of copper, silver, lead, tin, zinc, and
petroleum would have all run out by now, and the world would be
struggling to find enough arable land to feed a population of over 7
billion people. Without governmental efforts to change global trends,
\"\[t\]he most probable result will be a rather sudden and
uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity,\" the
authors warned. As should be obvious, the [[predictions]{.mark}
offered]{.underline} in The Limits to Growth (and other contemporary
doomsayers) [were **wildly [off the mark]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Among
other things, they [failed to account for how **[markets]{.mark} respond
to scarcity**]{.underline}, [[produc]{.mark}ing [incentives for]{.mark}
**efficiency and [innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[so]{.mark} that
[we]{.mark} may [do more with less]{.mark}]{.underline}. In short, the
authors failed to understand why markets encourage sustainability.
[Those predicting]{.underline} imminent [depletion of global
resources]{.underline} and exhaustion of the earth\'s carrying capacity
also [failed to predict]{.underline} what is arguably the most important
\-- and under-appreciated \-- **[positive]{.underline}** [environmental
trend of the 21st century]{.underline}:
**[[Dematerialization]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of modern
economies]{.underline}. The same **[economic incentives]{.underline}**
which forestalled resource exhaustion have [actually enabled people to
do more with less throughout the developed world.]{.underline} This
dramatic development is chronicled in Andrew McAfee\'s book, More from
Less: The Surprising Story of How We Learned to Prosper Using Fewer
Resources --- and What Happens Next, which I reviewed for Regulation.
Here is an excerpt from my review: **[Dematerialization]{.underline}**
may be [the **most important**]{.underline}, yet unsung, [example of
environmental progress in the 21st century]{.underline}. It is
commonplace to observe that the relentless drive to do more with less
has led to more efficient resource use, so that a soda can today is made
with a fraction of the metal required 50 years ago. But
dematerialization is not merely a story about increased efficiency or
per‐​capita reductions. [What is]{.underline} now [being
observed]{.underline} [represents a **fundamental
decoupling**]{.underline} [of resource consumption from economic
growth]{.underline}, such that [[as]{.mark} mature [economies]{.mark}
[grow]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[they]{.underline}]{.mark} not only
[[use]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[fewer resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**
per unit of output, but [they also **consume fewer resources
overall.**]{.underline} In short, economic [growth]{.underline} in the
most developed nations increasingly [coincides with a net reduction in
resource consumption.]{.underline} Let that sink in. It is not merely
that we are using resources more efficiently in countries like the
United States. It\'s also that we are actually using fewer total
resources year-over-year. The [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[uses]{.underline}
[less]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[gold]{.mark}, [steel]{.mark},
[aluminum]{.mark}, [copper]{.mark}, stone, cement,]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [even]{.underline} **[paper]{.underline}** [than it
did at the start of this century]{.underline}, despite the continued
increase in gross domestic product. Annual [consumption of [all but
six]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the **[72]{.mark} resources**]{.underline}
[tracked]{.underline} by the U.S. Geological Service [[are]{.underline}
\"**[post peak]{.underline}**]{.mark}.\" [We]{.underline} also
[use]{.underline} [[less]{.underline} **[fertilizer and
water]{.underline}**]{.mark} while growing more crops. [Plastic
consumption]{.underline} is up, as is [energy use]{.underline}, but
these two appear to [have been]{.underline} **[decoupled]{.underline}**
[from population and economic growth as well.]{.underline} How does this
dematerialization occur? Some examples may be useful. The
dematerialization of soda cans is relatively easy to grasp, particularly
for those of us who can remember the heavier cans of the 20th century.
Aluminum cans weighed 85 grams when introduced in the 1950s. By 2011,
the average can was under 13 grams. Cans today are not only thinner and
lighter, they are produced more efficiently, with fewer separate sheets
of metal. **[[Substitution]{.underline}]{.mark}** can be an even more
[powerful source of dematerialization]{.underline}. Consider
telecommunications. A single fiber optic cable made from less than 150
pounds of silica can carry the same volume of information as multiple
1‑ton copper cables. And were that not enough, satellite and wireless
technologies enable us to bypass the use of physical cables altogether.
[We can communicate more and yet use vastly less material to do
so]{.underline}. This not only saves copper, but other resources too.
[Think of all the paper saved by **e**‑**mail, e‑banking, and
e‑readers.**]{.underline} Not only did [neo-Malthusians]{.underline}
**[not predict]{.underline}** [these developments]{.underline}, [they
failed to recognize that such [trends]{.mark} would be **[driven by
private markets]{.mark}**, and not governmental regulation. We do more
with less]{.underline} not [because of]{.underline} government
regulation or administrative direction, but because of
**[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline}
**[technology]{.underline}**. These are the [dominant forces
[driving]{.mark} [demat]{.mark}erialization]{.underline} in the most
developed countries and they [could unleash]{.underline} [similar gains
in the]{.underline} **[rest of the world]{.underline}**. We \"want more
all the time, but not more resources,\" McAfee notes. We want more of
what resources can provide, and one way to get more is to do more with
less. [Market capitalism]{.underline} both facilitates and
[enhances]{.underline} the [underlying incentives that **drive
[efficiency gains]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nological advance]{.underline}. This not only leads to
dematerialization but also promotes \"critical aspects of well‐​being,\"
including health and prosperity. Unfortunately, these trends are not
universal. While we consume fewer resources in developed nations, these
trends have not (yet) taken hold in many developing countries, which
often lack well-functioning market economies. We have also not observed
equivalent trends in many forms of pollution, largely because emissions
are not priced the way consumption is. [An entrepreneur who figures out
how to produce widgets while using less copper gains an economic
advantage, as the copper must be paid]{.underline} [for.]{.underline} An
entrepreneur who figures out how to emit fewer particulates or nitrogen
oxides does not, as emitting such pollutants is not meaningfully priced
and contemporary regulations rarely create meaningful incentives for
emission reductions on the margin. [Understanding]{.underline}
**[what]{.underline}** has [encouraged]{.underline} and allowed for
[dematerialization]{.underline} at the same time that populations have
expanded and economies have grown is essential if these
[trends]{.underline} are to be **[replicated]{.underline}** in
[developing countries]{.underline} [and if we are to **meet contemporary
environmental challenges**]{.underline}, [including **climate
change**]{.underline}. A suite of policies designed to replicate the
same market dynamics that have led [dematerialization]{.underline}
[could [spur]{.mark} **meaningful
[decarbonization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ill-conceived policies, on the
other hand, could actually do more harm than good. This is but one more
reason policymakers should be more interested in fiscal instruments than
regulatory mandates to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Another article
in the same issue of Regulation as my More from Less review notes that
[greenhouse gas [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} in the United States may
have [**[peaked]{.underline}** [in 2005]{.underline}]{.mark}, and that
[GHG emissions]{.underline} appear to **[initially
increase]{.underline}**, [but then]{.underline}
**[decline]{.underline}**, [with economic growth]{.underline}. Such
trends are not observed, however, in less-developed and
less-market-oriented economies, such as China. The authors, Bruce Yandle
and Jody Lipford, think this indicates that [domestic GHGs]{.underline}
could **[[continue to decline]{.underline}]{.mark}** going forward,
[[**even** **without**]{.mark} **new** government
**[policies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This may be so, but the reductions
are nowhere near what would be achieved if carbon emissions were priced
and there were more powerful market incentives for market
decarbonization. [Greater **[market]{.mark} incentives** for
decarbonization could also [lead to]{.mark} the development and
**[deployment of low-carbon tech]{.mark}nologies** [that]{.mark} could
[facilitate **emission reductions**]{.mark} in other countries as well,
and given that climate change is a global concern, such measures will be
necessary if atmospheric stabilization is to be achieved.]{.underline}
The bottom line is that [competitive markets create **powerful
incentives**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} efficient and [sustainable
resource use.]{.underline} [Market-driven innovation has made it
possible to provide for more people using fewer resources]{.underline}.
Such environmental successes are often ignored because there is no
policymaker or program than can take credit for them. [They are the
result of market processes, **not governmental direction or
design.**]{.underline}

#### Capitalism causes [dematerialization]{.underline} which solves sustainability questions

**Zitelmann 21** -- studied history and political sciences, graduating
with a doctorate "summa cum laude" in 1986. His dissertation was

[Some people claim]{.underline} that [we need to cut our
consumption]{.underline} or there will be no hope for the planet. Such
[[claims]{.mark} are [based]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} the thesis that continued growth increases the
rate at which the earth's [[finite resources]{.underline}]{.mark} are
consumed and, moreover, leads to irreversible climate change. And
**[such warnings are [by no means new]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In 1970,
for instance, the Club of Rome attracted a great deal of attention with
the publication of The Limits to Growth. A Report for the Club of Rome's
Project on the Predicament of Mankind, which has to date sold more than
thirty million copies in thirty languages. The book warned people to
change their ways and had a clear message: the world's raw materials,
and in particular, oil would soon be used up. In twenty years, the
scientists predicted, we would have used the very last drop of oil. Of
course, the Club of Rome's models for the depletion of oil---and almost
all other major raw materials---were wrong. [According to the
scenarios]{.underline} presented in The Limits to Growth, [[we
should]{.mark} now [be]{.mark} living on a planet that has been [devoid
of]{.mark} [natural gas, copper]{.mark}, lead, aluminum and tungsten for
decades]{.underline}. And **[we were supposed to have run out of silver
in 1985.]{.underline}** Despite the bleak forecasts, as of January 2020,
the United States Geological Survey estimated silver reserves worldwide
at 560,000 tons. Employing an extensive array of data, the American
scientist Andrew McAfee proves in his book More from Less that
**[[economic growth]{.mark} is [no longer]{.mark} [coupled to]{.mark}
the [consumption]{.mark} of raw materials.]{.underline}** Data for the
United States, for example, show that [[of seventy-two
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}, from aluminum to zinc, **[[only six are
not yet post-peak]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Nevertheless, [[despite
the]{.mark} fact [that the]{.mark} U.S. [economy has grown]{.mark}
strongly]{.underline} in recent years, **[[consumption]{.mark} of many
commodities [is]{.mark} actually [decreasing]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Back in 2015, the American environmental scientist Jesse Ausubel wrote
an essay, "The Return of Nature: How Technology Liberates the
Environment," showing that [Americans are consuming fewer and fewer raw
materials per capita. [Total consumption]{.mark}]{.underline} of steel,
copper, fertilizer, wood and paper, which had previously always risen in
line with economic growth, **[[had plateaued]{.mark} and was now in
constant decline]{.underline}**. Such [across-the-board
reductions]{.underline} in natural resource consumption are [[only
possible because of]{.mark} much-maligned
[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[companies]{.mark} are constantly
[developing more efficient production]{.mark} methods and reducing the
amount of raw materials they consume.]{.underline} Of course, **[they
are]{.underline}** not **[doing this]{.underline}** primarily to protect
the environment but **[[to cut costs]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What\'s
more, a [constant stream of innovations]{.underline} has
[promoted]{.underline} the trend of miniaturization or
[dematerialization]{.underline}. Just think of your smartphone. How many
devices has your smartphone replaced and how many raw materials did they
use to consume? Nowadays, many people no longer have a fax machine or
street atlas because they have everything they need on their smartphone.
Some even use their phones instead of a wristwatch. You used to need
four separate microphones in your telephone, cassette recorder,
Dictaphone and video camera, today you just need one---in your
smartphone. [The finite nature of the world's natural resources is one
argument against growth]{.underline}, **[[climate change]{.mark} is
another]{.underline}**. Let's take China as an example:
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} currently [emits more CO2 than any other
country]{.underline} in the world and is
**[[building]{.underline}]{.mark}** a number of **[new [nuclear power
plants]{.mark} in order to [achieve carbon neutrality]{.mark} by
2060]{.underline}**. With the new build program well underway, China's
first new-generation nuclear power plant recently went into operation.
In the very near future, China intends to start exporting power plants.
[The latest generation of nuclear power plants is much safer than
earlier models---and can play [a pivotal role]{.mark} in the fight
against climate change]{.underline}. In the United States, Joe
[[Biden]{.mark}]{.underline} is already [evaluating]{.underline} the
advantages of small modular reactor (SMR) **[nuclear power
plants]{.underline}**. As the name suggests, SMRs are smaller than
traditional nuclear fission reactors and offer a maximum capacity of
three hundred megawatts. In the [U]{.underline}nited
[K]{.underline}ingdom, for example, a consortium led by Rolls-Royce has
announced plans to [[build]{.underline}]{.mark} up to sixteen
[[SMR]{.mark} power plants]{.underline}. So far, two reactors of this
type are in operation, both onboard the floating nuclear power plant
"Akademik Lomonosov, which supplies heat and electricity to the Siberian
city of Pevec and its one hundred thousand inhabitants. Anticapitalists
blame capitalism for resource consumption and climate change. But
[[political decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}---[such as]{.underline}
Germany's decision to phase out [nuclear
energy]{.underline}---frequently **[[have a negative impact on climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Telling people to cut their
consumption]{.underline} must seem like [pure mockery to
the]{.underline} hundreds of [millions of [people]{.mark}]{.underline}
around the world who are still [living [in]{.mark} extreme
[poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[What they [need]{.mark}
is]{.underline}** more capitalism and **[[economic
growth]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Just like [in
China]{.mark}]{.underline}, where the number of [people living in
extreme [poverty]{.mark} has [fallen from 88]{.mark} percent [in]{.mark}
19[81]{.mark} [to]{.mark} less than [1]{.mark} percent
[today]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Andrew McAfee's book has an
optimistic message about how we don\'t have to turn back the clocks and
cut our consumption: capitalism and technological progress are allowing
us to steward the world's resources, rather than stripping them bare.

#### Privatization is necessary for space colonization -- disruptions kill that potential

[It was one small step for man, one [giant leap for
capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Only three countries have ever launched
human beings into orbit. This past weekend, **[SpaceX became the first
private company ever to do so]{.underline}**, when it sent its Crew
Dragon capsule into space aboard its Falcon 9 rocket and docked with the
International Space Station. [This was accomplished by a company Elon
Musk started in 2002 in a California strip mall warehouse with just a
dozen employees and a mariachi band]{.underline}. [At a time when our
nation is debating the merits of socialism[, **SpaceX**]{.mark} **has
given us [an incredible testament to]{.mark} the power of
[American]{.mark} free [enterprise]{.mark}.**]{.underline} While the
left is advocating unprecedented government intervention in almost every
sector of the U.S. economy, from health care to energy, today [Americans
are celebrating the successful privatization of space
travel.]{.underline} If you want to see the difference between what
government and private enterprise can do, consider: **[It [took a
private company to give us]{.mark} the first [space vehicle]{.mark} with
touch-screen controls instead of antiquated knobs and buttons. It took a
private company to give us [a capsule that can fly]{.mark} entirely
autonomously from launch to landing --- including docking --- without
any participation by its human crew. It also took a private company to
invent [a reusable rocket]{.mark} that can not only take off but land as
well.]{.underline}** When the Apollo 11 crew reached the moon on July
20, 1969, Neil Armstrong declared "the Eagle has landed." On Saturday,
SpaceX was able to declare that the Falcon had landed when its rocket
settled down on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean --- ready to be used
again. That last development will save the taxpayers incredible amounts
of money. [[The cost to NASA]{.mark} for launching a man into space on
the space shuttle orbiter was [\$170 million]{.mark} per seat, compared
with just \$[60 million]{.mark} to \$67 million [on the Dragon]{.mark}
capsule.]{.underline} The cost for the space shuttle to send a kilogram
of cargo into to space was \$54,500; with the Falcon rocket, the cost is
just \$2,720 --- a decrease of 95 percent. And while the space shuttle
cost \$27.4 billion to develop, the Crew Dragon was designed and built
for just \$1.7 billion --- making it the lowest-cost spacecraft
developed in six decades. [SpaceX did it in six years --- far faster
than the time it took to develop the space shuttle]{.underline}. [The
[private sector does it better, cheaper, faster and more
efficiently]{.mark} than government. [Why?
**Competition**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Today, SpaceX has to compete
with a constellation of private companies --- including legacy aerospace
firms such as Orbital ATK and United Launch Alliance and innovative
start-ups such as Blue Origin (which is designing a Mars lander and
whose owner, Jeff Bezos, also owns The Post) and Virgin Orbit (which is
developing rockets than can launch satellites into space from the
underside of a 747, avoiding the kinds of weather that delayed the
Dragon launch). [In the race to put the first privately launched man
into orbit, upstart SpaceX had to beat aerospace behemoth Boeing and its
Starliner capsule to the punch]{.underline}. It did so --- for more than
\$1 billion less than its competitor. **[That [spirit of
competition]{.mark} and innovation will [revolutionize space
travel]{.mark} in the years ahead]{.underline}**. Indeed, Musk has his
sights set far beyond Earth orbit. [Already, [SpaceX is working
on]{.mark} a much larger version of the Falcon 9 reusable rocket called
Super Heavy that will carry a deep-space capsule named Starship capable
of carrying up to 100 people to the moon and eventually to
Mars.]{.underline} Musk's goal --- the reason he founded SpaceX --- is
to [**colonize Mars and [make humanity a multiplanetary
species]{.mark}**. He has set a goal of founding a million-person city
on Mars [by 2050]{.mark} complete with iron foundries and pizza
joints]{.underline}. Can it be done? Who knows. But this much is
certain: **[[Private-sector innovation]{.mark} is [opening the
door]{.mark} to a new era of space exploration.]{.underline}** [Wouldn't
it be ironic if, just as capitalism is allowing us to explore the
farthest reaches of our solar system, Americans decided to embrace
socialism back here on Earth?]{.underline}

you\'d suffocate trying to breathe the atmosphere made up of mostly
carbon dioxide. But before even that, the very low atmospheric pressure
on Mars would cause your blood to literally boil, regardless of the

underground bases \-- one of NASA\'s latest concepts even involves
Martian homes made of fungi. While Mars may be preferable to closer
options like Venus with its boiling heat and toxic atmosphere, or the
moon with zero atmosphere and space stations lacking gravity, it\'s
still a problematic environment. \"You would fizz to death,\" the SETI
Institute\'s Pascal Lee explains in the video below. On Earth we never

extremely thin air. **[[Easy peasy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** However, Lee

them as insurmountable hurdles. In fact, [there might be **one

SpaceX idea, though. The [Mars Society]{.underline}, founded in 1998 to

2040]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,\"]{.mark} Zubrin told me in 2018. Besides
bringing their own shelter to start, Martian pioneers must also pack the
right tools to harvest materials from the rugged landscape in order to
build a more permanent crib. \"Very little that pertains to living on
Mars in the early years will involve off-the-shelf equipment and
supplies from Earth,\" writes Stephen Petranek in his book How We\'ll
Live on Mars. \"Almost every tool or device in use on Mars will need to
have been carefully thought out.\" Building from scratch For the long
term, a basic modular camp like the one Matt Damon struggles with in
2015\'s The Martian may not offer sufficient protection from radiation
and other dangers, especially in the case of a powerful solar flare
aimed directly at Mars. **[[Radiation shielding]{.mark} doesn\'t need to
be high-tech]{.underline}**. [A barrier made up of [water or]{.mark}
certain [plastics]{.mark} can [work]{.mark}, as can simply going
underground.]{.underline} Former NASA physician Jim Logan estimates
putting our fragile, fleshy bodies behind or beneath about **[[9
feet]{.mark} (2.7 meters) [of Martian soil]{.mark} should
suffice]{.underline}**. Zubrin has also suggested using thick bricks
made from Martian regolith to construct shelter, adding a uniquely
medieval castle vibe to the more traditionally sleek and futuristic
vision of a Mars outpost. [Old lava tubes and underground caves are also
ideal places to shelter, both early on and in the case of emergencies
like major dust and solar storms that can sometimes spread across the
entire planet.]{.underline} In the absence of other options, **[[3D
printing]{.mark} technology [offers]{.mark} another alternative for
creating [custom structures]{.mark}]{.underline}**. NASA held a 3D
printed habitat challenge in 2019, with New York\'s AI SpaceFactory
(which bills itself as a \"multi-planetary architectural and technology
design agency\") winning the top prize for a system that built a
lightweight but strong structure using autonomous robots requiring
almost no human guidance. Going underground or behind thick walls isn\'t
exactly great for the agriculture that\'s going to be essential to
sustain any presence on Mars, however. Mechanical engineer Andrew
Geiszler suggested at the 2015 Mars Society convention that **[[geodesic
glass domes]{.mark} could be the answer]{.underline}**. [[Mars
provides]{.mark} all [the]{.mark} raw [materials]{.mark} needed to
create glass, plastic and metals that can then be turned into dome
homes.]{.underline} \"**[Ultimately we\'re going to need to use native
materials. It\'s very feasible. They\'re there for the
taking]{.underline}**.\" The glass dome structure has been popular in
visions of Mars settlements going back decades, including in some recent
renderings from HP\'s Mars Home Planet concept challenge that asked
designers to draw up plans for a city on Mars. This leaves the question
of exactly where on Mars is best to establish a presence. None of the
above is possible without access to water, which we need to create
oxygen, grow food and produce fuel and other raw materials. So finding
precious H2O will be a top priority along with shelter from the elements
when choosing a site. [[Water has been found]{.mark} in Martian soil, in
trace amounts in the air, and in significant amounts near and below ice
deposits. Moving to the edge of a Martian ice cap would likely be too
cold and windy, but the [planet]{.mark} also [offers]{.mark} intriguing
[craters]{.mark} and canyons [that pro]{.mark}vide a certain amount of
[shelter,]{.mark} building materials and water from deposits of ice or
possibly even springs. The remarkable Valles Marineris, a massive gorge
eight times longer and four times deeper than the Grand Canyon, is one
place often suggested as a dramatic second home for hardy humans. **Time
to [Terraform]{.mark}**]{.underline} Maintaining all of the necessary
life support systems on Mars will be quite an undertaking, which is why
[Musk and others have a long, long term vision of expanding the
habitable bubble we construct on Mars to eventually encompass the entire
planet. **The concept is often referred to as
terraforming**]{.underline}, and [would [involve]{.mark} changing the
planet\'s environment to be more earth-like. Musk notably proposed
nuking Mars\' poles to [release]{.mark} massive amounts of [greenhouse
gases to warm the planet]{.mark}, although he\'s also amenable to
massive solar mirrors.]{.underline}
