[The act is the EU\'s **third significant law**]{.underline} targeting
the tech industry, [a **notable contrast**]{.underline} [with the
U.S.]{.underline}, [where lobbyists representing Silicon
Valley]{.underline}\'s interests [have]{.underline} **[largely
succeeded]{.underline}** [in keeping federal lawmakers at
bay]{.underline}.

[While the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have filed
major **antitrust actions**]{.underline} against Google and Facebook,
[Congress remains **politically divided**]{.underline} [on efforts to
address]{.underline} competition, online privacy,
**[disinformation]{.underline}** and more.

The [EU\'s new rules]{.underline} should make tech companies more
accountable for content created by users and amplified by their
platforms\' algorithms.

The biggest online platforms and search engines, defined as having more
than 45 million users, will face extra scrutiny.

Breton said they will have plenty of stick to back up their laws,
including \"effective and dissuasive\" fines of up to 6% of a company\'s
annual global revenue, which for big tech companies would amount to
billions of dollars. Repeat offenders could be banned from the EU, he
said.

[The tentative agreement **was reached**]{.underline} between the EU
parliament and the bloc\'s member states. [It still needs to be
**officially rubber-stamped**]{.underline} [by]{.underline} those
[institutions, which is expected **after summer**]{.underline} but
should pose no political problem. [The rules]{.underline} then [won\'t
start applying until **15 months after**]{.underline} [that
approval]{.underline}, or Jan. 1, 2024, whichever is later.
