I. INTRODUCTION

[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [expends
**significant resources** on]{.underline} what it calls [efforts to
preserve **international peace** and **security**.]{.underline} These
costs are [incurred both through U.S. agencies directly and through
**[international organizations]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
[which]{.underline} the United States plays a part. Both U.S. agencies
and international organizations also [[have]{.mark} the [**capability**
to **infringe** on]{.mark} **legally** and **normatively guaranteed
[rights]{.mark}** of Americans and non-U.S. citizens.]{.underline}
However, [despite the **sums expended** by Americans and the **potential
infringements** and **abuses** by **international organizations**, U.S.
[citizens have]{.mark} very [**few mechanisms** to obtain
**info**]{.mark}**rmation** about these organizations.]{.underline} This
is in contrast to the established regime of transparency required and
practiced by U.S. agencies. Specifically, [the existing [**transparency
tools** for]{.mark}]{.underline} citizen oversight of two international
security organizations, the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(**[NATO]{.mark}**)]{.underline} 1and the International Criminal Police
Organisation (INTERPOL), 2[[are inadequate]{.mark} because [they
**default to secrecy**]{.mark} rather than **balancing organizational
needs** against the **requirement** for **public
legitimacy**.]{.underline}

A. Public Interest in NATO Operations

[U.S. support to NATO takes two **primary forms**: **indirect
contributions** in the form of American **troops deployed** on NATO
missions and **direct contributions** in the form of **American money**
provided for **NATO\'s budget**.]{.underline} 3In June 2008, the United
States contributed 23,550 troops to NATO\'s International Security
Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, in addition to 19,000 forces
operating independently of NATO in Afghanistan under Operation Enduring
Freedom (OEF). 4In June 2019, the U.S. contribution to Resolute Support
(RS), NATO\'s successor mission to ISAF, was 8,475 troops. 5In addition,
the United States contributed about \$ 570 million to NATO\'s
headquarters in 2018 alone. 6

[The]{.underline} U.S. [**[D]{.mark}**epartment **[o]{.mark}**f
**[D]{.mark}**efense accepts that its [troops must]{.mark}, inter alia,
[**plan** and **execute operations** in]{.mark}]{.underline} Afghanistan
7in [[**compliance** with]{.mark} the **law of war** principles of
**proportionality** and **distinction**]{.underline}. 8When [U.S. troops
commanded]{.underline} 9[by NATO]{.underline} under the former ISAF and
current RS mission engage in combat, they [must follow certain rules of
**[international law]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 10One such rule,
[**[proportionality]{.mark}**, requires military commanders to **weigh**
the expected **combat benefits** of action against the **incidental
harms** to the **civilian population**, [and]{.mark} **avoid combat**
where the **incidental harms** are **excessive compared** to the
**benefits** of the legitimate military mission]{.underline}.
11[**[Distinction]{.mark}**, another law of war principle, mandates that
commanders take care to **differentiate** between **enemy forces**,
which can be **targeted**, and **civilians**, who cannot be
**intentionally targeted**.]{.underline} 12

[However, [during]{.mark} **non-international** **armed
[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline} such as the one in Afghanistan,
[military [authorities]{.mark} may [experience]{.mark} **greater
[difficulties]{.mark}** [distinguishing]{.mark} between **enemy
combatants** and **civilians**]{.underline}. 13As a result,
[[NATO]{.mark} and independent U.S. forces in Afghanistan have killed
hundreds of civilians in airstrikes.]{.underline} 14[Human rights groups
have alleged these **military [forces failed]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
properly **[follow i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}** in the course of
such attacks.]{.underline} 15Yet, as demonstrated below, [the [records
of U.S. forces]{.mark} are **presumptively open** to **civilian
inspection**, [allow]{.mark}ing Americans [to **assess**]{.mark} **the
[legality]{.mark}** [of the **force**]{.mark} used in our name and with
our tax dollars, while the [**records** of **NATO forces are
not**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 16

II\. CASE STUDIES

Existing [**international** organization **transparency efforts fail**
to account for the]{.underline} public\'s interest in their actions and
for the [need for **public legitimacy**]{.underline}. 66This [lack of
transparency is borne out by]{.underline} two case studies of
international organizations that perform public duties like those
undertaken by comparable U.S. agencies, with similar risks to human
rights, but without the same level of public transparency: (1) [**NATO**
troops made up of soldiers from the United States and other nations
compared with U.S.-commanded troops in **Afghanistan**]{.underline}, and
(2) INTERPOL Red Notices compared with domestic arrest warrants.

A. NATO Airstrikes in Afghanistan

Both [NATO forces and U.S. forces in Afghanistan are funded by U.S.
taxpayers, both help to implement U.S. security interests,
and]{.underline} both [have the **potential** to **violate**
**i**nternational **laws** and **norms**]{.underline}. However, for the
reasons explained below, [the actions of U.S. forces are far **more
transparent** to the U.S. taxpayer **than** the actions of **NATO
forces**]{.underline}.

1\. Structure and Mission of NATO and U.S. Forces in Afghanistan

In order to understand the different levels of transparency applied to
NATO and U.S. forces undertaking similar public duties in Afghanistan,
it is first necessary to understand the basic organizational details and
legal authorities of both institutions. Transparency itself depends on
the entity from which the armed forces derive their authority and on the
organizational arrangements used by those armed forces.

a\. NATO Structure

The North Atlantic Treaty establishes only one NATO body, the North
Atlantic Council. 67The Council contains representatives from each state
party and has authority to \"set up such subsidiary bodies as may be
necessary.\" 68The North Atlantic Council has created a military
hierarchy for its armed operations. 69The chief military authority is
the Military Committee, which consists of the most senior military
officer of each member country or his or her representative. 70The
Committee is assisted by its International Military Staff. 71

Subordinate to the Military Committee is the military command structure,
which is composed of two commands: Allied Command Operations and Allied
Command Transformation. 72Allied Command Transformation is led by
Supreme Allied Command Transformation and focuses on strategic planning
and readiness. 73Allied Command Operations directs and executes all
military operations and is led by the Supreme Allied Commander Europe
(SACEUR) from the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in
Belgium. 74Traditionally, SACEUR is also the U.S. military officer in
charge of U.S. European Command. 75

The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was authorized by the
U.N. Security Council to provide security in and near the Afghan
capital, Kabul, in December 2001. 76NATO took control of the ISAF
mission in August 2003. 77ISAF\'s authority was expanded to encompass
the entire country in October 2003. 78ISAF was terminated in 2014 and
replaced with the RS mission. 79The NATO commander in Afghanistan is
subordinate to SACEUR/SHAPE. 80

b\. U.S. Forces Structure

Separate and apart from U.S. troops operating in Afghanistan under the
NATO banner, the U.S. military also commands troops in Afghanistan
directly. 81The structure of those forces is the result of the evolution
of American military organization in the twentieth century more broadly.
82Past the beginning of World War II, the Department of War and the
Department of the Navy, the two extant departments of the American
military, 83operated autonomously from one another. 84In response to the
shortcomings of this approach, Congress and the executive branch took
steps during and after World War II to increasingly remove the
leadership of the military departments from any direct control over
military operations. 85

In 1986, responding to concerns that the military departments still
exercised too much informal control over operations, 86Congress
officially removed the departments from any command over the operational
elements. 87That reform, which still provides the basic framework for
the American military structure, 88tasks the military departments 89with
preparing their forces for combat. 90The military departments then
assign their forces to the combatant commands, which have operational
authority. 91The President is responsible for creating combatant
commands and assigning their areas of operation or responsibilities.
92There are presently eleven active combatant commands, including U.S.
Central Command (CENTCOM), 93the combatant command responsible for U.S.
forces in Afghanistan and the Middle East more broadly. 94

Most U.S. troops in Afghanistan who are not assigned to the NATO mission
are under the control of U.S. Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A), which in
turn, is a component of CENTCOM. 95USFOR-A was created by the Department
of Defense in 2008 to merge several different Afghanistan chains of
command into one, and it commanded most soldiers assigned to OEF, which
has subsequently been replaced by OFS. 96Since USFOR-A was created in
2008, its commander has always simultaneously commanded NATO troops in
Afghanistan under the ISAF and then RS missions. 97

2\. Alleged Abuses

Airstrikes carried out by both NATO and U.S. forces are a consistent
source of civilian casualties in Afghanistan. Human Rights Watch has
alleged that airstrikes by these two military organizations were
responsible for 116 civilian deaths in 2006 and 321 in 2007. 98In 2018,
the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan counted 393
civilian deaths and 239 civilian injuries caused by aerial operations by
U.S. and NATO forces for a total of 632 civilian casualties. 99These
figures are disputed by military officials. 100However, the issue with
these casualties for the purpose of this comment is not so much their
exact number, but the fact that they raise serious concerns about
whether the United States and NATO are complying with relevant law of
war standards. 101Human Rights Watch and the U.N. noted similar casualty
trends across time in both reports. For instance, both organizations
noted their concern about civilian casualties caused by relatively
spontaneous airstrikes carried out in support of ground forces, as
opposed to airstrikes planned well in advance. 102

3\. Comparative Inability to Access NATO Records

Both the United States and NATO have transparency laws or policies.
103However, NATO\'s transparency policy is far weaker. As a result,
there is no public right to access most NATO documents, even though
their equivalents are public under U.S. law. Because the commander of
NATO forces in Afghanistan is an American, 104and most NATO troops are
contributed by the U.S., 105it is arguable that many NATO records should
be accessible as records of one or more U.S. military agencies. However,
the Department of Defense has concluded that NATO records in the
possession of American personnel assigned to NATO are not records of
U.S. agencies. 106

a\. High-Level Policy Documents

In the United States, laws and quasi-legislative documents of the
federal government must be made public, a requirement that falls under
the legislative and judicial type of transparency. First, the U.S.
Constitution itself requires public access to Congressional enactments.
107Second, provisions of the Freedom of Information Act require
executive agencies to publish all general rules and policies. 108As a
result, the public has access to a wealth of information about the law
and policy governing the American armed forces. These include not only
the law, 109but also voluminous quasi-law policy documents from the
Department of Defense and the services branches, such as Department of
Defense Directives, 110service regulations, 111and doctrinal
publications. 112If an executive branch agency refuses to disclose such
policy documents, any individual can seek a court order compelling their
release. 113

In contrast, NATO\'s transparency policy is far more limited. First,
unlike the Freedom of Information Act, NATO\'s policy is limited to
historical documents\--those thirty years or older, which NATO has
determined for itself to have permanent historical significance. 114Even
though the present war in Afghanistan is now nearly twenty years old,
115this transparency mandate does not extend to any policies enacted
since NATO became involved in that conflict. 116Second, the policy
provides no mechanism for outside enforcement. 117

b\. Investigations into Alleged Abuses

The Freedom of Information Act is not limited to official policy
documents. It also creates a presumption of access to unpublished
internal government records, an example of executive type transparency.
118This presumption is qualified with several exceptions, including
classified information and information that would compromise
investigations. 119Even so, U.S. military agencies must at times release
the results of their investigations into alleged human rights abuses.
For instance, after a high-profile incident in which soldiers assigned
to USFOR-A carried out an airstrike against a hospital operated by the
charity Médecins Sans Frontières in Kunduz Province, CENTCOM released a
redacted copy of the investigation report under the Freedom of
Information Act. 120Agency failures to disclose records of these
investigations are subject to judicial review. 121

When U.S. troops under either command allegedly carry out human rights
abuses, both NATO and U.S. authorities may carry out investigations into
such allegations. 122However, NATO appears to carry out more frequent
investigations, while the United States undertakes relatively few
civilian casualty investigations under its internal procedures. 123Under
the NATO Public Disclosure Policy, none of the investigative results
from NATO investigation processes are publicly available for at least
thirty years. 124As a result, valuable information about compliance with
the law of war is not available to the public.

#### Strong LOAC norms against civilian casualties prevent satellite attacks

**Beard, 18**---associate professor of law at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln (Jack, interviewed by Brandon McDermott, "Crafting The
Manual For Warfare In Space,"
<http://netnebraska.org/article/news/1163396/crafting-manual-warfare-space>,
dml)

There\'s another factor here too, the growing commercialization of
space. With more and more launches, [with **more** and **more
satellites**]{.underline} -- the individual operators the individual
companies -- those are the responsibility of the states under the rules
that are now in place in the Outer Space Treaty. You can see, [as space
becomes **more congested** and **more competitive** that there are going
to be **problems** that]{.underline} are likely to [occur]{.underline}
between -- for instance -- space mining entities. Which is no longer a
far-fetched idea. [As competition for resources in space grows the
**likelihood of a conflict grows**]{.underline} and so you\'d like to
try to interpret [some of the terms]{.underline} that **[haven\'t been
applied yet in space]{.underline}**. Phrases like "interference," or
"due regard," which are found in the treaties haven\'t ever been
interpreted to this point in any real detail.

[It would be nice to know **what the appropriate response is** to
certain actions in space and things that are perceived as hostile in
order to **prevent as much damage as possible to civilian objects** and
to **civilians**. The **law of armed conflict** has as one of its
**central goals** preventing unnecessary or excessive damage to the
**civilian population**. There are satellites up there that are **solely
dedicated to all sorts of humanitarian purposes**]{.underline} --
weather satellites, satellites related to rescue and emergency --
[those]{.underline} sorts of things [**aren\'t appropriate targets** in
an armed conflict and should be **treated with some special
regard**]{.underline}.

#### Satellite attacks cause nuclear war

**Grego, 17**---Senior Scientist, Global Security Program, with the
Union of Concerned Scientists (Laura, "50 years after the Outer Space
Treaty: How secure is space?,"
<https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2017/12/50-Years-OST-article.pdf>,
dml)

For the foreseeable future, [**military tensions** among the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [**China**, and
**Russia** are likely to **remain high**, as are those between **China**
and **India**]{.underline}. It is imperative to track investments and
[strategies]{.underline} that [could **escalate a crisis** or lead
actors to consider **approaching** or **crossing the nuclear
threshold**. **Attacks on satellites can create** or **escalate
terrestrial crises** in ways that are **difficult to predict** and which
are **particularly dangerous among nuclear powers**]{.underline}.

[While the OST prohibits nuclear weapons in space, it is **less
specific** about other military activity]{.underline}, and states have
different interpretations of "peaceful purposes." Thus, [the drift is
toward a space regime that includes **increasingly sophisticated
anti-satellite technology**, with **very little mutual understanding**
about how actions in space are perceived and **what
constraints**]{.underline}, if any, **[global governance
provides]{.underline}**.

[States---and]{.underline}, increasingly, [sub-state actors---have been
developing technologies that can be used to **interfere with
satellites**]{.underline}. Not all such technologies are equally
dangerous, and it may be possible to prioritize appropriate limits.
Signals jamming, for example, is relatively low-tech, but is also
limited temporally and spatially in its effects; identification of the
perpetrator is relatively straightforward, even if remedies for the
interference are less so. More concerning are technologies with a
strategic-sized capability, or which are stealthy and hard to attribute,
or which make intent difficult to discern; [these technologies can
provide **new** and **unpredictable paths to crisis escalation**. The
inventories of such weapons are **growing** and relevant technology is
**proliferating**]{.underline}.
