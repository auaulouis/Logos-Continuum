[You might argue that it can only be a good thing if the Europeans step
up their defence arrangements]{.underline}. But this has little to do
with increasing military muscle. **[It is not the answer]{.underline}**
to the plea by successive US presidents for the Europeans to do more on
defence. [NATO is well established, well proven and
credible.]{.underline} 27 of its 30 member countries are European,
including 21 that also happen to be EU countries. So [why create another
structure?]{.underline}

[Any EU force would have to draw on the **same limited military
resources**]{.underline} [and would be a **duplicative**, **divisive**
**distraction**]{.underline}. [EU ambitions already intrude into NATO
where coordination structures between the two organisations have now
been set up]{.underline}, in spite of the fact that their membership is
largely the same. [The EU wants to become the European leg of NATO -- so
where would that leave key non-EU European members of NATO such as the
UK, Norway and Turkey]{.underline}? In any case, **[the EU countries
can't even agree among themselves]{.underline}**. Many pay lip service
to the idea of CSDP while refusing to participate in any meaningful way.
Even the arch-federalist European Parliament, in its most recent report
on EU defence, noted that "in over 15 years of existence EU battlegroups
have never been used, in particular due to the lack of political
consensus among Member States and the complexity of implementation and
funding..."

At NATO HQ in the early '90s, the French were already pushing for
European military capabilities separate from NATO. [When the Bosnian
crisis began they demanded that the matter should be discussed not at
NATO but 'in another place']{.underline} -- by which they meant the
Western European Union (WEU), [a purely European group whose
headquarters was just down the road in central Brussels. As a
consequence, nonsensically, two allied navies operated in the Adriatic
and Mediterranean, one under NATO command and the other under
WEU]{.underline}, with more or less the same ships rotating between the
two. Once the Bosnian military operations got more serious, even France
gave up on this farce and backed the NATO option.

#### Creating EU strategic autonomy [trades off]{.underline} with security cooperation AND causes [hot internal debates]{.underline} that [divide]{.underline} the EU.

3.1.2 Reconciling Strategic Sovereignty and the Transatlantic
Relationship The idea that the EU must have the capacity for autonomous
action, backed up by credible military forces, the means to decide to
use them, and a readiness to do so, in order to respond to military
crises goes back to the 1998 St. Malo Declaration. Since then, [the
question of what constitutes an **acceptable balance** between a more
independent European security and defence policy and transatlantic
**security cooperation in NATO** has been **hotly disputed on both
sides** of the Atlantic]{.underline}. The fear of upsetting the US and
jeopardising the American security commitment to Europe was a good
reason for many European member states to keep EU defence efforts to a
minimum. However, the election of Donald Trump as US president has
decisively changed the parameters of the debate. The US' strong
footprint in European security could no longer be taken for granted. For
many Europeans, this was a wake-up moment that brought the need for
greater autonomy from the US back into focus. At the same time, [the
very notion of **'strategic autonomy'** became **toxic**]{.underline}.
[While Europeans insisted that strategic autonomy was not synonymous
with a Europe **'going it alone'**, Washington, but also some EU member
states, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, perceived it as an
attempt for **de-coupling** and hence as a **threat**]{.underline}. On
this account, [German defence minister]{.underline} Annegret
[KrampKarrenbauer spoke on behalf of many Europeans]{.underline} when
she sent her message to the incoming Biden administration in November
2020[:]{.underline} '[The idea of strategic autonomy for Europe goes too
far if it is taken to mean that we could guarantee security, stability
and prosperity in Europe without]{.underline} NATO and without [the
US']{.underline}. 36 [The related dispute between her and]{.underline}
French President Emmanuel [Macron has once again shown that Europeans
themselves have **not yet agreed** on how far Europe should be able to
act independently of the United States.]{.underline}

#### [Only the US]{.underline} can do security cooperation with NATO on AI\-\--EU is far behind on [funding]{.underline}, [adoption]{.underline}, and [private investment]{.underline}.

Before proceeding, [it is]{.underline} **[worth spelling
out]{.underline}** [the extent to which European security is
dependent]{.underline} on NATO and [in particular on the
US]{.underline}. Of the EU's 27 member states, 21 are members of NATO.
These countries account for about 93% of the population1 of the EU.
[Within NATO]{.underline}, those [Allies that are also EU members only
account for about **20%** of total defence expenditure across the
Alliance, while the US alone accounts for about **70%** of the same
total]{.underline}.2 Beyond these aggregate indicators, [it is
furthermore the case that the US is **considerably ahead** of the EU in
terms of practical adoption of AI]{.underline}. For illustration, [in
2020 US private-sector investment in AI was around \$23.6 billion, but
was only \$2 billion in the EU, implying a ratio of **12 to 1** in
favour of the US]{.underline} (Zhang et al. 2021, 96). Scientific output
indicators offer a more nuanced picture. [In]{.underline} 2019, the EU
accounted for 16.4% of the world's [peer-reviewed AI
publications]{.underline}, ahead of the US with 14.6%, while China
occupied the top spot with 22.4% (Zhang et al. 2021, 20). On the other
hand, if one measures research output [in terms of publications on the
Arxiv database, the US is ahead of the EU]{.underline} (Zhang et al.
2021, 33) [by a ratio of almost two to one]{.underline}, which is
[nonetheless much less than the large gap in private
investment]{.underline} mentioned above. That [the EU
performs]{.underline} similarly to the US in terms of scientific
research, but [far less well in terms of investment and
commercialisation of new digital technologies,]{.underline} is [an **old
problem** which has proven **very difficult to address**, whether at
national or EU level]{.underline} (Baroudy et al. 2020).

#### [Technical impracticalities]{.underline} between EU states and [ideological divergences]{.underline} mean EU-NATO cooperation fail.

However, [the difference in how commitment to respective sets of values
is executed in NATO and EU results with a **wide portfolio of
cooperational problems**, ranging from bureaucratic to strategic,
**despite** their **intention to work together.**]{.underline} Could
there be comprehensive and mutually respectful cooperation between the
two organizations on security issues? Would this cooperation be
wearproof given the bilateral conflicts brought up by non-joint members,
such as in the Cyprus dilemma? This article surveys how [bilateral and
regional conflicts **challenge** the international **resolve for**
transatlantic **security cooperation**]{.underline}, in which NATO and
EU share common milito-political interest.

The European Common Security and Defense Policy: Boon or Bane

The [Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP)]{.underline}, known
before 2009's Lisbon Treaty as the European Security and Defence Policy,
[represented the **apex** of security cooperation among European Union
member states and]{.underline} the EU's undertaking of a heavier defence
role along with [NATO]{.underline}. The CSDP seeks to exercise European
military independence from NATO within five areas: the self-assured
security of the EU, a closer relationship between eastern and western
Europe, structural improvement in European conflict management,
cooperation between neighboring regions, and pioneering global
governance of conflicts. To implement these priorities into pre-existing
European structural mechanisms, the EU's civilian-military status has
undergone an updating process. For instance, the European External
Action Service (EEAS) was created through the Lisbon Treaty, signed in
2007, which made the EU constitutional laws legally binding and further
centralized the Union. The Lisbon Treaty also sought to address the
independent methods in which the EU member states were answering
international crises.

When EEAS was launched in December 2010 as an EU department with the
express function of consolidating EU responses to international security
issues as an autonomous unit, it actualized CSDP's vision for a new
European crisis management strategy which technically compelled member
states to cooperate in situations of security threats, in or out of the
EU. Initiatives similar to EAAS make clear [what the EU lacks has
**not** been the **incentive** to incorporate an international security
dimension to its agenda, but the **technical practicality** to implement
decisions to that end in a unified manner]{.underline}. [**Although
common goals** had been set for NATO-EU cooperation through the Berlin
Plus Agreements]{.underline} in 2003 [before CSDP, creation of a unified
transatlantic defence and security policy between the two entities has
encountered **ample executive difficulties**]{.underline}. For instance,
[Cyprus -- an EU but not NATO member- was excluded from joint EU-NATO
meetings by Turkey -- a NATO but not EU member- due to the decades long
political antagonism over the Turkish invasion of Northern Cyprus in
1974]{.underline}. [Even this]{.underline} **[seemingly
inconsequential]{.underline}** [bilateral problem was enough to
\[halt\]]{.underline}~~paralyze~~ the [NATO-EU cooperation]{.underline},
[making some organizational details]{.underline} of Berlin Plus
Agreement **[impossible]{.underline}**.

Berlin Agreement's [decision to create a merged NATO-EU headquarters in
Brussels to manage conflicts in which both the EU and NATO have common
interests has **not helped** reduce the fracture between American and
European politics]{.underline}. For instance, when France and Germany
coordinated a joint gathering with Belgium and Luxembourg to protest the
British-American invasion of Saddam Hussein's Iraq, NATO and then
American government denounced it as "Chocolate Summit," betraying the
spirit of cooperation aimed by CSDP. Joint NATO-EU missions for
stabilization in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2004, in Dafur, Sudan, as an
assistance to African Union or in Somali to combat piracy are, however,
some successful products of Berlin Plus Agreements. These joint
undertakings are cases in which not all the EU or NATO members were
interested in intervention, but they were made possible by sharing of
military expertise and assets from either of the parties, mostly by
NATO. However, post-colonial Africa and Western Balkans are regions over
which NATO and EU do not have strong strategic disagreements. [Despite
Berlin Plus, EU has been **critical** of NATO's call for joint missions
in Afghanistan for instance and only supported the civilian projects of
current Resolute Support Mission of NATO.]{.underline}

Bilateral hurdles in front of NATO-EU cooperation such as Cyprus Dispute
are hence not the actual root causes hindering the constructive attitude
of Berlin Plus. As Europe's disapproval of Iraqi invasion or reluctance
of cooperation in Afghanistan demonstrates, [the CSDP cannot overcome
the]{.underline} **[strategic divergence]{.underline}** [of NATO and EU
in issues of incompatible political interests]{.underline}.
**[Ideological divergence]{.underline}** of the two partners [should be
reconciled before]{.underline} the region specific problems are
addressed by calls for [joint military actions]{.underline}. The new and
more NATO-conscious level of ambition for CSDP thus required European
member states to invest more in security and defence, both politically
and economic. Perhaps an important undertaking was revisiting Berlin
Plus Agreement's comfort in EU utilizing NATO asset and capabilities
when necessary, instead initiating more EU-focused solutions like EAAS.

[With the attenuation of this cooperative ethos in both sides, there is
a present risk that NATO and the EU will begin to **compete** for
limited military resources]{.underline}, straying from the envisioned
Berlin Plus Agreement. [Lack of a coherent strategy among Western
partners could **prevent efficient response to crises**, which does not
bode well in a time of humanitarian atrocities]{.underline} --- whether
it be in Syria, Yemen, or South Sudan.

#### New initiatives set a [clear signal]{.underline} that the EU is working towards tech sovereignty in the [squo]{.underline}.

[EU TECHNOLOGICAL SOVEREIGNTY **IS IN THE MAKING**]{.underline}

[Behind the EU's recent]{.underline} **[multiple sovereignty
agendas]{.underline}** [is the need to stay ahead of the curve when it
comes to innovation.]{.underline} The very label of a geopolitical
European Commission [implies a new level of engagement for the EU in the
global balance of power. **Technological** and digital **sovereignty**
**are at the heart**]{.underline} of such ambitions. The outbreak of the
[coronavirus]{.underline} pandemic has further [exacerbated the urgency
to shore up technological, digital, and regulatory responses to preserve
the EU's economic clout, industrial competitiveness, and geopolitical
influence, as well as to reduce dependencies in critical technology
areas]{.underline}. What has the EU done so far, and what must it still
do to meet that goal of technological sovereignty? Four cross-cutting
dimensions can help unpack the concept of technological sovereignty and
better structure the discussion about EU initiatives, programs, and
instruments: Research and capability-development efforts in security and
defense Investments in cutting-edge research and innovation and in
digitalization Critical infrastructure resilience and security of supply
Tech-related regulatory activism

DEFENSE CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT

According to Arnout Molenaar, the head of division in the European
External Action Service, dealing with security and defense policy is
also related to "a learning curve for the Union to develop a 'hard
power' mentality." Technology plays a fundamental role in terms of
making possible the EU's hard military power ambitions---not only to act
in a tense geopolitical setting but also to defend the EU's interests in
areas related to technology, security, and defense matters. In this
regard, [collaborative EU defense research and development (R&D)
initiatives have been prioritized at the EU level for some time now to
support the competitiveness of the European Defence Technological and
Industrial Base]{.underline}.

[EU institutions and agencies have made **considerable efforts** to
preserve Europe's edge in key areas, including **emerging** and
disruptive security **technologies** and infrastructures such as
**cybersecurity**, **drones**, secure **networks**, **space**
technologies, artificial intelligence (**AI**), and quantum
technology]{.underline}. Indeed, [recent EU initiatives such as
the]{.underline} European Commission's European Defence Fund
([EDF]{.underline}) [as part of the EU's Multiannual Financial Framework
(MFF),]{.underline} 2021--2027---[as well a]{.underline}s its precursor
programs, the [Preparatory Action on Defence Research and the European
Defence Industrial Development Programme---are intended to financially
empower the EU's autonomy in defense technology and industry and its
research and innovation capacity in future-oriented and disruptive
defense technologies]{.underline}.

Such [initiatives have been framed as]{.underline} **[timely
catalysts]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} potential **[game
changers]{.underline}** [for increasing collective European action and
for fostering cutting-edge defense research and innovation in
Europe]{.underline}. The [commission funded the Preparatory Action on
Defence Research as a test case of defense-related research and
technology projects, pulling directly from the EU budget line rather
than from member states' joint initiatives]{.underline}. [This scheme
was a]{.underline} **[concrete step]{.underline}** [designed to
demonstrate the added value of EU-supported defense technology research
and innovation]{.underline}. If successfully implemented, the EDF is
expected to bolster more lucrative and joint research and
capability-driven investment schemes in defense technologies across
Europe and to increase the EU's global leadership position in strategic
tech sectors. The commission has already pledged a relatively small
percentage of up to 8 percent of the EDF funding to disruptive
technology actions. However, with the initially proposed amount of 13
billion euros (\$15.4 billion) now reduced to about 8 billion euros
(\$9.5 billion), the EDF's real potential to create value added and to
incentivize technological and industrial cooperation and competitiveness
in Europe is unclear. Indeed, this reduction could be accounted for by
the fact that some member states either took a budget-restrictive
approach to the entire 2021--2027 MFF or judged that on balance, they
would benefit less from the EDF than their contribution to it and thus
opted for reducing the overall funding. What is certain is that the EDF
marks an important paradigm shift in consolidating the EU's increased
supranational activism in the field of defense technology and industry
as a basis for building the EU's military hard power and defense
portfolio. The fund also consolidates the European Commission's
increasing role and strong interventionism in the EU security and
defense policy fields that have traditionally been the exclusive
preserve of member states' decisionmaking.

[There is]{.underline} also [a clear message that developing the defense
industry and technology base in Europe is key to strategic
autonomy]{.underline}. Hence, logic dictates that defense-related
technological sovereignty is central to the EU's strategic autonomy.
Nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether the reduced funding dedicated
to the EDF and the small percentage of it that is flagged for disruptive
military technologies are sufficient to foster high-risk, high-reward
technological innovation in the European defense sector.

[In addition to]{.underline} these [overarching EU initiatives, a number

In the last five years, direct association between EU defence
integration efforts (such as CDP, CARD, PESCO, EDF) and the notion of
European strategic autonomy has become widespread -- at least when this
term is understood to mean defence and a narrower understanding of
'security' rather than, say, economic self-reliance. Yet [the pace of
cooperation and emergence of new structures hides a **wide range of
official positions** held by different EU member states, and differing
views and visions even within each individual nation's
politics]{.underline}. Most notably, the views of [European officials
and experts differ on the question of **leadership**, the degree of
**autonomy**, the desired level of the EU's **ambition** and the optimal
**balance** between national and joint capability
development]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} various [divergences,
jointly, and separately, **undermine** the **cohesiveness** and
therefore the feasibility and credibility of the general ambition to
achieve European strategic autonomy.]{.underline} This section briefly
outlines the issues pertaining to each of these categories of debate and
disagreement.

PROBLEMS IN NATO-EU COOPERATION As the [overall strategic interests and
security priorities of NATO and the EU have begun to overlap in response
to emerging global challenges]{.underline}, [the relationship --- and
hence cooperation --- between the two organizations has
become]{.underline} more **[complex]{.underline}**. [Limited
communication channels]{.underline} Although personnel exchanges and
joint exercises have helped to set up a framework and a mindset for more
integrated operations, officials interviewed for this paper24 under the
condition of anonymity pointed out that [information sharing and the
results achieved have been very limited]{.underline}. The [lack of a
secure communication system to share information between the two
organizations **severely hinders** their ability to work together on a
daily basis but most importantly to **coordinate** in a real crisis
scenario and consequently to put in place a joint response.]{.underline}
As of now, [there is no direct inter-institutional secure lines of
communication between the EU and NATO]{.underline}. All communications
take place between each member state and either within NATO or within
the EU. This also is [particularly relevant when it comes to
sharing]{.underline} **[best practices]{.underline}** [or handing over
tasks from one organization to the other.]{.underline}25

[Political tensions and different strategic priorities]{.underline}
Adding to this communication difficulty, [political tensions have
multiplied within both NATO and the EU, triggering a **climate of
distrust** that prevents intelligence sharing]{.underline}. Turkey's
purchase of Russian S-400 surface-to-air missiles26 and its invasion of
northern Syria after U.S. troops withdrew raised security concerns in
the alliance, while the Northern Cyprus question and Ankara's activities
in the eastern Mediterranean waters have created tensions with Greece.27
Relations between France and the U.K. have also significantly worsened
since the AUKUS deal, which could ultimately impact the functioning of
NATO. Complicating matters further, as described above, [the two
organizations' activities have started to overlap, with NATO embracing
capacity-building and cyber operations and the EU stepping up on crisis
management]{.underline}. More recently, during preparation of its
strategic concept, NATO has been questioning its role in the fight
against climate change and in countering China's multifaceted influence
in the trans-Atlantic space. And following the AUKUS deal, the EU has
been reflecting on developing a stronger military to be able to respond
to crises directly impacting its security. [NATO opposes any form of
duplication, from command to resources, which is quite telling in terms
of its soul-searching for the definition of its objectives and its range
of action vis-à-vis global challenges]{.underline}.28 Recent [events in
Afghanistan offer]{.underline} a very good [opportunity to reflect on
the role of NATO and EU aspirations]{.underline}. After the Taliban took
back Kabul, NATO called for an assessment of the accomplishments and
failures of ISAF and Resolute Support.29 But instead [the
EU]{.underline} --- not directly [involved in Afghanistan]{.underline}
as an organization but rather [through individual member
states]{.underline} --- [and the United Kingdom reflected on their
excessive dependence on the United States in areas of paramount
importance to European security]{.underline}. As evacuation operations
started in Kabul, with devastating images traveling around the world,
Borrell defined Afghanistan as a "wake-up call" for the strengthening of
European defense.30 Allies complained about the United States' lack of
coordination and communication on the withdrawal, its unwillingness to
extend the deadline for evacuations. For its part, the United Nation
Security Council rejected a French-U.K. proposal to establish of a
U.N.-controlled safe zone around the Kabul airport.31 While it is
debatable whether or not the EU would have used its hypothetical army to
secure Kabul's airport, [the Afghanistan experience exposed Europeans'
vivid vulnerabilities in the security domain and their dependence on the
U.S. military's logistical and technological capabilities.]{.underline}

Arguments are made that limited European resources would be more
effective if integrated. This has become one of the EU's main selling
points for EU defence. It sounds plausible -- but [if you add up the
defence budgets of 26 EU countries]{.underline} (Denmark has opted out
of EU defence) [you arrive at a figure of approximately \$200
billion]{.underline} (2020) or 1.5% of the accumulated GDPs of these
countries. [The US spent about **\$800 billion**]{.underline}, which is
some 3.7% of GDP. And [you certainly do not need EU involvement to
create joint forces with allies]{.underline}. The history of purposeful
coalitions goes back centuries. In recent times, under NATO, we have had
the 14-nation ACE Mobile Force, the UK/Netherlands Amphibious Force, and
the German/Dutch Corps as examples of closely aligned national
formations. All this has worked perfectly well. There is no need for EU
involvement -- unless of course your motives are political rather than

the beginning of Ursula von der Leyen's tenure, the Commission has
initiated efforts to adopt stronger regulation for AI applications
(i.e., differentiating regulation of AI based on defined "high-risk" and
"low-risk" sectors") and associated data spaces.27,28 These legislative
proposals and their associated discussions are planned to be completed
by the end of 2020. During the strategic planning and budgeting process

Surveying EU cybersecurity and public private partnerships

The [two EU agencies ENISA and EUROPOL are the main]{.underline} public
operational or [executive actors in the area of EU
cybersecurity]{.underline}. [Both actors are heavily dependent on
cooperation with private actors for]{.underline} their [organisational
success, and are supposed to cooperate increasingly with each
other]{.underline}. At the same time, they clearly have different
mandates and respective relationships with private actors. The following
overview therefore uses the typological differentiation with regard to
the central tasks of PPPs, namely information-sharing and active
assistance, and sets in relation to the different audience or layers
that the two agencies appeal to.15 By providing a structured overview of
the types of relationships these organisations engage in, we hope to
provide a clearer picture of what cybersecurity partnerships in this
area actually look like in practice.

ENISA

**[ENISA]{.underline}**, the [European Union Agency for Network and
Information Security]{.underline}, [is the main organisation for
structural cybersecurity]{.underline}, i.e. [at the infrastructural and
technical/ logical level]{.underline}. [ENISA]{.underline} was founded
in 2004 and [has gradually established itself as a **leading provider**
of technical advice in Europe]{.underline} (see Farrand and Carrapico in
this issue) In particular, [the agency produces a large]{.underline}
[volume of]{.underline} conceptual [papers and organises
exercises]{.underline},16 workshops [and expert meetings on
cybersecurity]{.underline}. In 2013, ENISA was given an expanded and
permanent legal basis, which defined its organisational mandate as
follows (\[92\], 43): The Agency should contribute to a high level of
network and information security, to better protection of privacy and
personal data, and to the development and promotion of a culture of
network and information security for the benefit of citizens, consumers,
businesses and public sector organisations in the Union, thus
contributing to the proper functioning of the internal market.\^ In
light of this, [regular interactions across the public-private divide
are]{.underline} clearly [**essential** to the work of
ENSIA]{.underline}. At a very general level, this can be illustrated by
the inclusion of private representatives in the so-called permanent
stakeholder group, which should assist the management of ENISA after the
last revision of its mandate. 17 But already well before, [ENISA
conducted extensive research on different models and potential of PPPs
in the ICT sector]{.underline} \[93\], which supports several arguments
made in the first part of this article. Thus, [the agency underlines
that private actors are often unwilling to share
info]{.underline}rmation [on a voluntary basis and that formal
agreements or structures are necessary to ensure the operational
usefulness of PPPs to both private and public actors]{.underline}. At
the same time, the [focus of ENISA on]{.underline} more infrastructural
[layers of cybersecurity suggests that public-private interactions are
more likely to take the form of **coregulation** for general **standard
setting** or **security certification**]{.underline}. 18 This reflects
in a range of multi-stakeholder governance forums overseen by ENISA,
such as the BENISA Internet infrastructure security and resilience
reference groupB, 19 and the „Electronic Communications Reference Group
(ECRG)B20 These groups interact with other forums for technical
self-regulation, mainly the International Standards Organisation (ISO),
the European Electronic Standards Institute (ETSI, with MoU) and CEN
CELENEC for further industrial standards.21 [ENISA also engages in a
range of wider educational and awareness raising activities that should
stimulate greater cybersecurity investments among both public and
private actors.]{.underline} Aside from a so-called awareness raising
community of ENISA -- which seems to have been discontinued after 2010
-,22 the largest coordinated effort is the so-called cybersecurity
awareness month, which includes various private organisations.23
However, these educations activities cannot be considered as sustained
and substantial PPPs, since its target audience is diffuse and
participants are not expected to enter into more regular relationships
with ENISA. PPPs for information sharing (logical and user layer) For
more substantial PPPs for cybersecurity, one can instead turn to private
forums for sector-specific information sharing and which have contacts
to ENISA. Examples are the so-called European Financial Institutes --
Information Sharing and Analysis Centre 24 (EU-FISAC), or the so-called
European Cyber Security Protection Alliance (CYSPA),25 which united both
business and research institutions. A somewhat confusing array of
additional private initiatives and platforms, such as the Internet
Security Alliance for Europe and the Security Alliance for Europe, also
interact with ENISA and comment on EU policy.26 However, [the main
PPP]{.underline} officially [led by ENISA has been the]{.underline}
so-called BEuropean Public + Private Partnership for Resilience\^ (or
**[E3PR]{.underline}**). This [initiative emerged in the context of a
larger EU policy programme to increase the security of]{.underline}
Critical Information Information infrastructures
(**[CIIP]{.underline}**) \[94\]. [The]{.underline} E3PR [format
generated a number of thematic working and expert groups that should
exchange information on relevant vulnerabilities and define policy
options]{.underline} (compare Farrand and Carrapico in this issue).27
However, [the E3PR **failed** to generate tangible results due to the
diversity of stakeholders and avenues for action that could be
considered before the EU proposed a more **specific legislative
agenda**]{.underline} \[95\]. [Info]{.underline}rmation
[sharing]{.underline} channels for CIIP [issues remained highly
**fragmented** in Europe]{.underline},28 [particularly when aiming to
address the cross-sectoral vulnerabilities of
infrastructures.]{.underline} A [later official evaluation]{.underline}
report [of the E3PR underlined that]{.underline} that [multiple
**conflicts of interests** with regard to the confidentiality of data or
prospect of **costly mandatory security measures** further hampered the
emergence of the desired partnership]{.underline} \[96\]. By 2013, the
EU already debated the aforementioned NIS directive \[52\], which should
extend mandatory information sharing on cybersecurity incidents from
telecommunications providers 29 to other critical infrastructure
providers. Even before the directive has been politically agreed on in
December 2015, ENISA created the socalled NIS platform to succeed the
E3PR. By mid-2015, the NIS platform listed more than 200 members - with
approx. 110 of them representing business interests -,30 and had met at
least five times. This indicates a substantial effort of public-private
networking. Yet the terminological change from a partnership to a
platform for private industry is telling. Rather than promoting regular
operational or administrative cooperation, as we would expect in a
classic PPP, the NIS Platform has worked on a clearer agenda for
co-regulation and related policy options. For these purposes, ENISA
created three working groups, namely on risk management, information
exchange and incident coordination and, finally, secure ICT research and
innovation. Clearly, these tasks may also apply to operational PPPs, but
at the time of writing, the NIS platform has not reached beyond several
conceptual papers that were intended to prepare the implementation of
the upcoming NIS directive. 31 This stakeholder consultation should also
be viewed in wider international processes, as reflected in a recent and
first EU US meeting in that format. 32 In sum, the NIS platform should
mainly be regarded as a supporting process of regulatory governance of
critical infrastructures. Active assistance (logical and user layer) Yet
one point to another area where ENISA may take on a more operational
role for cybersecurity with private actors already, namely via its
support for Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). CERTs33 have been
developed since 2006 onwards. At the time, a few member states had
started to create such units in emulation of the US, which pioneered
this instrument already in 1990s \[97\]. By 2012, a separate EU CERT has
been created,34 while regular network activities and standardization of
procedures to coordinate the work of national CERTs were underway.35 The
web presence of the EU CERT further includes regular news items on cyber
threats and vulnerabilities of various applications. These CERTs
arguably constitute of boundary case for PPPs as defined for the
purposes of this paper. The leading US model is mainly public
organisation, which maintains close contacts with private business.36
Various national CERTs in Europe clearly have strong ties with the
private sector37 -- or conversely, CERTs of leading IT providers, such
as the German Telecom, maintain close contacts with the public sector,
including the EU level. 38 The EU CERT Mechanism similarly lists various
private companies and internet providers as Bpartners\^ 39 for regular
information sharing. However, [public authorities]{.underline} also
[increasingly seek to provide their own cyber response capacities
**without** having to partner with, or to rely on, private
assistance]{.underline}. 40 For instance, the so-called European
Governmental Cert Group 41 and officially listed partners of the EU-CERT
are purely made up of public authorities,42 while a recent analytical
paper uses the added qualifier of national CSIRTs (nCSIRTs), even if
there remain significant interfaces with private actors \[97\]. So
formalised governance networks can only be made out among public sector
CERTs. This interpretation of CERTs as moving away from PPP should be
tested in further comparative empirical research. In sum, ENISA
expresses strong support for public private partnerships for
cybersecurity, but mainly acts as a facilitator for technical
co-regulation and certification with private actors (at the logical and
infrastructure layer). ENISA organises stakeholder consultations in
relevant EU regulation on cyber and critical infrastructure, as in the
NIS Platform, and supports general awareness raising on cybersecurity
among both public and private actors. Yet [there is limited evidence for
more operational PPPs]{.underline}, as official CERTs increasingly focus
on the specific internal or defensive needs of public actors.

In just the last few years, [Europe has seen a sweeping law for online

The United States may be the birthplace of the iPhone and the most
widely used search engine and social network, and it could also bring
the world into the so-called metaverse. But [**global leadership on tech
regulations is taking place** more than 3,000 miles from Washington, by
European leaders representing 27 nations with 24 languages]{.underline},
who have nonetheless been able to agree on basic online protections for
their 450 million or so citizens.

[The European Union agreed]{.underline} on Thursday [to one of **the
world's most far-reaching laws** to address the power of the biggest
tech companies]{.underline}, potentially reshaping app stores, online
advertising, e-commerce, messaging services and other everyday digital
tools.

[The law]{.underline}, called the Digital Markets Act, **[is the most
sweeping piece of digital policy]{.underline}** [since the bloc put the
world's toughest rules to protect people's online data into effect in
2018]{.underline}. The legislation is aimed at stopping the largest tech
platforms from using their interlocking services and considerable
resources to box in users and squash emerging rivals, creating room for
new entrants and fostering more competition.

What that means practically is that companies like Google will no longer
be able to collect data from different services to offer targeted ads
without users' consent and that Apple may have to allow alternatives to
its App Store on iPhones and iPads. Violators of the law, which will
take effect as early as later this year, could face penalties of up to
20 percent of their global revenue --- which could reach into the tens
of billions of dollars --- for repeat offenses.

[The Digital Markets Act is part of a one-two punch by European
regulators. As early as next month, the European Union is expected to
reach an agreement on a law that would force social media
companies]{.underline} such as Meta, the owner of Facebook and
Instagram, [to police their platforms more aggressively]{.underline}.

With these actions, **[Europe is cementing its leadership as the most
assertive regulator of tech companies]{.underline}** such as Apple,
Google, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft. [European standards are often
adopted worldwide, and the latest legislation further raises the bar by
potentially bringing the companies under a new era of
oversight]{.underline} --- just like health care, transportation and
banking industries.

"Faced with big online platforms behaving like they were 'too big to
care,' **[Europe has put its foot down]{.underline}**," said Thierry
Breton, one of the top digital officials in the European Commission.
"[We are putting an end to the so-called Wild West dominating our
information space. A new framework that can become a reference for
democracies worldwide]{.underline}."

This comes at a moment when National Defence Technological and
Industrial Bases ([DTIBs) in Europe have increasingly come under
pressure to produce competitive defence capabilities, due to budgetary
restrictions and defence market forces]{.underline}. There is no denying
the fact that [the centre of gravity for security and defence technology
R&D and innovation has shifted from the national and military levels to
the corporate and civilian ones]{.underline}, because of a variety of
factors, such as economic austerity reasons and the sharp decline of
national defence R&D investment programmes in the post-Cold War period
in Europe. In this regard, the maintenance of a strong EDTIB was set out
to become a top mission for the EDA and the European Commission, by
improving security and defence capabilities, the military expenditure of
member states and by focusing on enhancing European security via the
development of innovative and competitive high-end technologies.

Political will has been developing in the EU concerning high-tech
security and defence capacity build-up, as demonstrated by the policy
initiatives and strategies recently spearheaded by the EDA and the
European Commission to empower the European defence technology and
innovation sectors. The rapprochement between the EDA and the European
Commission has increased significantly as shown by their combined
efforts to converge national strategic needs and advocate for a more
coherent pan-European common defence policy. The 2016 policy
initiatives, the Implementation Plan on Security and Defence (SDIP) and
the European Commission's European Defence Action Plan (EDAP), are
prefiguring a new practice of collaboration between the EDA and the
Commission to create a stronger European defence market, to revitalise
the European defence industrial base and to encourage member states to
spend more on defence research and emerging technologies. The European
Commission's launch of the Preparatory Action (PA) on CSDP-related
research and in partnership with the EDA as the hub of defence research
is indicative of such moves. The PA is a support programme in the form
of a one-off and of limited duration budget (Crespo 2015), which shifts
financing opportunities for the European defence industries from EU
member states to the EU per se.

The European Commission has proposed the PA back in 2014 for testing the
added-value of CSDP-related research within a permanent EU framework,
outside the limits of the Horizon 2020---The EU Framework Program for
Research Innovation type of civilian or dual-use R&D programmes. At the
time, if proven successful in the time-frame of 2017--2019, the PA was
heralded as a potential game-changer in the field of European defence
research, paving the way for permanent funding from the part of the
European Commission to support CSDP-related research. In an
unprecedented strategic move, it also opened the EU financing machine
for defence technologies research and development beyond the limiting
constraints of civilian or dual-use R&D and Research and Technology
(R&T) under the structural funds such as the Horizon 2020. The European
Defence Fund (EDF), presented in the European Commission's EDAP from 30
November 2016 is case in point, becoming the first supranational
financial tool to directly and exclusively fund cross-border European
defence research projects, with a view to developing innovative and
high-end security technologies.

In light of the above, a clear and resolute direction can be observed,
with conclusive steps taken in strengthening, deepening, and widening
the EU-level defence collaboration. There is no denying the fact that
the European Commission has had an agenda-setting role, taking important
steps to improve efficiency and cooperation in the defence sector: it
increased its efforts to complete the Single Market for defence; it
strengthened the competitiveness of the European industry; and it
bolstered the European defence research by maximising synergies between
civilian and military research (European Commission 2014). These steps
are also achieved through the SDIP and the EDAP, the European Commission
and the EDA working closely together with member states to outline these
initiatives. By taking into account such developments, the chapter
proposes a two-tiered research strategy, by first exploring the
emergence of a European trans-sectoral security field via a new
configuration of power relations and a convergence of interests at the
intersection of different national, supranational and corporate levels
in the case of future-oriented and high-tech research and development.
Second, it examines the role of EU-led innovation and governance of such
technologies in the specific cases of artificial intelligence and
autonomous robotics. The chapter builds on an interpretive methodology
that mobilises qualitative content analysis of various types of textual
data, such as official discourses, key reports, policy documents,
speeches and declarations, press releases, academic research, grey
literature from think tanks and expert evaluations. Consequently, the
chapter investigates the EU's agenda-setter potential as a key driver in
galvanising the European high-tech and defence sectors to bridge the
technological-innovation gap across intergovernmental-supranational,
civil-military and public-private nexuses in Europe to bring about a
'European comprehensive approach' to future and emerging security
technologies. In doing so, it also problematizes the possible
implications of Brexit on the European governance and development of
future and emerging technologies. Finally, it highlights the EU's
efforts in translating technological innovation in these fields into a
potential governance edge and the transformation of the EU into a
technological powerhouse.

The Council's first meeting in September 2021 led to a series of notable

semiconductor shortage]{.underline}, [both sides are committed to
"**identify\[ing\] gaps** in the semiconductor value chain" and
**enhancing** their respective semiconductor ecosystems]{.underline}.
The [U.S. and Europe have already begun taking important steps towards
this shared goal]{.underline}. Of note, the [European Commission has
drafted legislation to mobilize over **€43 billion** in public and
private funds to **double its share** of the global semiconductor
manufacturing market by 2030]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [in the United

[In February 2022, European Commission]{.underline} President Ursula von
der Leyen [announced the]{.underline} **[European Chips
Act]{.underline}**, [which adds **€15 billion** to an existing **€30
billion** in public investments to create new STEM-focused programs,
attract new talent to Europe, and build new infrastructure]{.underline}.
These actions are part of a strategy [to support]{.underline} a
**[thriving]{.underline}** [European semiconductor industry ecosystem,
**averting future shortages** of semiconductors, and **promoting
investment** into the European semiconductor industry.]{.underline}

Through this legislation, [the Commission hopes to]{.underline}:
[Increase EU resilience to supply chain disruptions like those created
by building **more domestic capacity**]{.underline}. [Make Europe a
long-term industrial leader in semiconductors, increasing its global in
manufacturing from 9% to 20% by 2030]{.underline}.

Areas of Focus: The European Chips Act focuses on five specific areas:

**[Research and Development:]{.underline}** The
[announcement]{.underline} by the European Commission President [calls
for further allocations of funds for research and development (R&D) to
keep up with global competitors]{.underline}. To augment the level of
research, the Commission will [further invest €3.3 billion in two
current programs: €1.65 billion to the "Horizon Europe" program and
€1.65 billion to the "Digital Europe" program.]{.underline} The
\"Horizon Europe\'\' program [focuses on pre-competitive **research,
development, and innovation** in the area of semiconductors]{.underline}
while, "The Digital Europe" program looks to [make digital domains and
technology widely available for all businesses and the general public to
**maximize performance** in key industries.]{.underline}

["From the lab to the fab": The European Chips Act also calls for more
effectively translating research into industrial innovation and
market-feasible products.]{.underline} Experts emphasize that Europe
must [bridge the gap between excellence in laboratory research and
onshore manufacturing to sustain leadership in
semiconductors]{.underline} and other advanced technologies.

**[Industry Production:]{.underline}** The [European Chips Act
recognizes that advanced production facilities come with huge up-front
costs. Europe is looking to host "first of its kind" facilities through
the creation of Integrated Production Facilities, which are factories
that design and produce semiconductor components that serve the European
market and through Open EU Foundries for chip design]{.underline}, which
are facilities that design and produce components for other industrial
actors such as medical devices and computer programming. The EU
Commission sees Europe lagging in chip production, so [if the EU can
accomplish building these Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU
foundries, the]{.underline} EU commission [goal of]{.underline}
increasing European chip production from [9% to 20% of global production
by 2030 becomes **significantly more reachable**.]{.underline}

**[Local Support:]{.underline}** [European policymakers see the need to
support the local skill base and the network of smaller, innovative
companies and start-ups as a part of their strategy to grow their
semiconductor and high technology ecosystems]{.underline}. To do this,
the [European Commission has established the "EU Chips Fund" which will
contribute **€2 billion** to create a more competitive market for
semiconductor start-ups to participate in and address skill
shortages]{.underline}. [Additionally]{.underline}, the Commission wants
to help [in the retention of employees]{.underline} that have the skills
that these start-ups need to be successful and to find industrial
partners for these start-ups to collaborate with.

**[Overhaul the European Supply Chain:]{.underline}** [The strategy also
seeks to advance the European Union's supply chain]{.underline}. Within
the EU, the Commission wants to [encourage Member States and industry
stakeholders to coordinate efforts towards an improved European supply
chain for semiconductors]{.underline}.. [To enable a **rapid response**
to the current shortages]{.underline}, the Commission has created a list
of recommendations to the Member States. [Along with **streamlining
policies** of member states, Europe is also looking to build
**partnerships with the U**nited **S**tates and other nations to create
a more **resilient** global semiconductor **network**.]{.underline}

is whether or not China requires Taiwan --- and in the future, they may

NATO and the European Union. [The strength of the transatlantic alliance
revolves around the axis of NATO, which has done more to promote
democracy, peace, and security in Europe than any other
alliance---including the European Union]{.underline}---since its
inception in 1949. Far from being outmoded, [NATO today is **more
relevant** and crucial for maintaining transatlantic security than it
has been since the end of the Cold War. While some in Brussels and
across the halls of power in Europe may have dreams of an independent EU
Army or an independent EU defensive apparatus capable of replacing NATO
and the U.S. military, true EU "strategic autonomy" in defense is a
**chimera**]{.underline}.

[**The EU** will **never** be able to provide the peace and stability
that NATO]{.underline}--- with feet firmly rooted in both North America
and Europe for the past 70 years---[has delivered, and will continue to
deliver. While EU-led defense initiatives may be able to provide some
defense improvements at the **margins**, the outsized costs include
decisions that enervate NATO, exacerbate existing fractures within
Europe, and severely stress the transatlantic link.]{.underline}

NATO's reflection should approach further NATO--EU initiatives
cautiously. [While the EU undoubtedly maintains competencies that will
be necessary and useful for responding to the challenges associated with
a return to great power competition, the EU cannot fulfill the security
role in Europe currently performed by the U.S. and NATO. For peace and
security, it is **essential** that **NATO** maintain its keystone role
in European defense policy. This means firmly **push**ing **back**
against EU defense integration efforts that are not in the interests of
the Alliance.]{.underline}

When it comes to EU strategic autonomy, [NATO should insist
that]{.underline} former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
["3Ds" continue to be respected---(1) **no decoupling** of U.S. security
from European security, (2) no **duplication** of structures or
initiatives that already exist within NATO, and (3) no
**discrimination** against non-EU NATO members.]{.underline}

[The **stakes** are **high**. If]{.underline} [the]{.underline}

--]{.underline} exemplified by the absence of a coordinated global
response to the COVID-19 pandemic [-- will continue]{.underline}. Even
the diplomatic muscle memory that has enabled the limited recent
examples of cooperation will fade.

[Why shouldn't someone else lead?]{.underline} Simply put, **[because no
one else can]{.underline}**. [There is **no single actor**]{.underline},
[or even a **collection of actors,** that is ready to take America's
place.]{.underline}

[Consider the **E**]{.underline}uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion, [which
has long fancied itself a potential standard-**bearer of liberal
values**]{.underline}. [It certainly possesses many of the
**attributes**]{.underline} of an exemplar: [vibrant and diverse
cultures, dynamic civil societies, well-institutionalized systems for
upholding human rights and the rule of law, and a commitment to
multilateralism.]{.underline}

And [yet, in many areas **vital** to global **leadership**]{.underline},
**[the EU falters]{.underline}**. [A **lack of political will** has
meant]{.underline} [that Europe has **consistently** **misallocated
resources**]{.underline}. [As a result, it has **failed** to build up
**adequate shared capacity**]{.underline} [or even to create the
conditions for doing so]{.underline}. For example, [EU leaders
**insist** that Europe needs to **achieve "strategic autonomy,"**
without **agreement** on **what that means**.]{.underline}

More fundamentally, [the EU **lacks** the **self-assurance** it would
need to serve as a **credible** and **compelling**]{.underline} [example
for the world. To change that, it must first define and convey a
compelling raison d'être,]{.underline} which can form the basis of its
own revitalized model. [It must then **dedicate** **significant
resources**]{.underline} -- **[time]{.underline}**,
**[effort]{.underline}**, and **[money]{.underline}** -- [to building
the **capacity** and **status** needed to **project its
influence**]{.underline}. In short, the EU must walk the walk.1

Unless and until it does, [the US will be **indispensable**, because it
is **irreplaceable**. That makes it all the more important for the Biden
administration]{.underline} not only [**to re-engage with the world**
and]{.underline} [the **multilateral system**]{.underline} [as a
convening power]{.underline}, but also to find a way to heal the US.
Only a reasonably united America can stand tall, look forward, and serve
as the beating heart of the liberal international order.

**[Anarchy has not come to Africa]{.underline}** -- [at least not in the
expanding, all-encompassing way meant by the pessimists of a decade or
two ago]{.underline}. The continent is far from uniformly peaceful, and
current outbreaks of violence are reminders of the need for more
progress. On the whole, however, [Africa is less war-torn than at any
time in the past, which runs contrary to widespread perceptions that
exist even among foreign policy experts]{.underline}. Kaplan remains
unchanged, claiming recently that his most important predictions have
actually been borne out.95 However, [the evidence suggests that despite
neo-Malthusians fears, by most measures life on the continent is
improving. **War is becoming less of a threat** to the life of the
average African than emerging middleincome threats like traffic
accidents or diabetes.]{.underline} Nor have realist fears of predatory
wars and wholesale remaking of the map of Africa come to pass. That is
not meant to dismiss the suffering of residents of the Central African
Republic, South Sudan or northern Nigeria, nor to suggest that all is
well. The[re are hundreds of millions of Africans who do not face as
great a threat of armed conflict]{.underline} as they once did, however.
It is important to see Africa as more than 50 distinct countries, some
-- and by historical standards, relatively few -- of which are beset by
warfare, even if they continue to face other, even greater challenges.
Nothing guarantees that these trends will continue. Indeed, several
require active maintenance. [If the outside world stops responding to
African hotspots, at least with diplomatic resources and avoiding
support to plunder-financed armed groups, conflict becomes more
likely.]{.underline} Intense American --Chinese competition could
encourage internal conflict or spur vicious circles of tension between
neighbours. [The United Nations, former colonizers and AFRICOM have all
been useful in helping to bring stability to the continent, but their
long-term interest is hardly assured.]{.underline} A global recession or
a wave of protectionism could dash optimism about economic growth. But
for now, for the first time in quite some time, **[there is reason for
optimism about the decline of warfare in Africa]{.underline}**. What the
United States and other outsiders should not do, however, is continue to
look at Africa though a lens that overemphasizes conflict and a few
crisis-afflicted nations. Additional American support for African
peacekeeping capability is welcome, but an increase in American
investment in African economies would do even more good for more people.
Policymakers should emphasize to the business community how much is now
going right in Africa. The Obama Administration has taken useful steps
in that direction, but at other times shows signs of the
'Africa-as-Anarchy' mindset. Programmes to help African governments
build capacity outside the military-security sphere could be expanded,
such as police and judicial systems, or the infrastructure and service
delivery needs of large cities in which a growing share of Africans
live. Africa faces many problems. [Peace does not necessarily bring
freedom, justice, or prosperity. But today a far greater percentage of
people on the continent live without serious risk of dying due to
warfare than pessimists expected.]{.underline} On the contrary, 'end of
war' optimists may prove to be right about Africa too, if on a slower
time scale than most of the world. Perhaps a rising generation of
leaders and citizens are being influenced by both global norms and
expectations of greater opportunities. Africa is surely the hardest test
of the global trend away from international conflict. If conflict can no
longer find a home there, will it be welcome anywhere?

[**\"**Latin America is violent]{.underline} and dangerous.\" Yes, [but
not unstable]{.underline}. Latin American countries have among the
world\'s highest rates of crime, murder, and kidnapping. Pockets of
abnormal levels of violence have emerged in countries such as Colombia
\-- and more recently, in Mexico, Central America, and some large cities
such as Caracas. With 140,000 homicides in 2010, it is understandable
how Latin America got this reputation. Each of the countries in Central
America\'s \"Northern Triangle\" (Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador)
had more murders in 2010 than the entire European Union combined.
Violence in Latin America is strongly related to poverty and inequality.
When combined with the insatiable international appetite for the illegal
drugs produced in the region, it\'s a noxious brew. As strongly argued
by a number of prominent regional leaders \-- including Brazil\'s former
president, Fernando H. Cardoso, and Colombia\'s former president, Cesar
Gaviria \-- a strategy based on demand reduction, rather than supply, is
the only way to reduce crime in Latin America. [Although some fear the
Mexican drug violence could spill over into the southern United States,
Latin America poses little to no threat to international peace or
stability. The major global security concerns today are the
proliferation of nuclear weapons and terrorism. No country in the region
is in possession of nuclear weapons \-- nor has expressed an interest in
having them. Latin American countries]{.underline}, on the whole, [do
not have much history of engaging in cross-border wars. Despite the
recent tensions on the Venezuela-Colombia border, it should be pointed
out that Venezuela has never taken part in an international armed
conflict]{.underline}. [Ethnic and religious conflicts are very
uncommon]{.underline} in Latin America. Although the region has not been
immune to radical jihadist attacks \-- the 1994 attack on a Jewish
Community Center in Buenos Aires, for instance \-- they have been rare.
[Terrorist attacks on the civilian population have been
limited]{.underline} to a large extent to the FARC organization in

[Is a new Cold **War** looming]{.underline} --- or already present ---
[between the **U**nited **S**tates and **China**?]{.underline} Many
analysts argue that a combination of geopolitics, ideology and competing
visions of "global order" are driving the two countries toward emulating
the Soviet-U.S. rivalry that dominated world politics from 1947 through
1990. But such **[concerns are overblown]{.underline}**. [Here are
**four big reasons**]{.underline} why[. **1. The historical backdrops of
the two relationships are very different**]{.underline} When the Cold
War began, the U.S.-Soviet relationship was fragile and tenuous.
Bilateral diplomatic relations were barely a decade old, U.S.
intervention in the Russian Revolution was a recent memory, and the
Soviet Union had called for the overthrow of capitalist governments into
the 1940s. Despite their Grand Alliance against Nazi Germany, the two
countries shared few meaningful diplomatic, economic or institutional
links. [In **2019**]{.underline}, the situation between the United
States and China is very different. Since the 1970s, [**diplomatic
interactions**, **institutional ties** and **econ**omic **flows** have
all **exploded**. Although each side has criticized the other for
domestic interference]{.underline} (such as U.S. demands for journalist
access to Tibet and China's espionage against U.S. corporations), [these
issues did not prevent cooperation on]{.underline} a host of [other
issues.]{.underline} Yes, there were **[tensions]{.underline}** over the
past decade, but these [occurred against a generally **cooperative
backdrop**. **2. Geography and powers' nuclear postures suggest East
Asia is more stable than Cold War-era Europe**]{.underline} The Cold War
was shaped by an intense arms race, nuclear posturing and crises,
especially in continental Europe. Given Europe's political geography,
the United States feared a "bolt from the blue" attack would allow the
Soviet Union to conquer the continent. Accordingly, the United States
prepared to defend Europe with conventional forces, and to deter Soviet
aggrandizement using nuclear weapons. Unsurprisingly, the Soviet Union
also feared that the United States might attack and wanted to deter U.S.
adventurism. Concerns that the other superpower might use force and that
crises could quickly escalate colored Cold War politics. [Today, the
**U**nited **S**tates and China spend **proportionally far less** on
their militaries than the **U**nited **S**tates and the Soviet Union
did.]{.underline} Though an arms race may be emerging, U.S. and Chinese
[**nuclear postures** are not]{.underline} nearly [as large or
threatening: Arsenals]{.underline} remain far below the size and scope
witnessed in the Cold War, and [are kept at a **low**er state of
alert.]{.underline} As for geography, [East Asia is **not primed for
tensions**]{.underline} akin to those in Cold War Europe[. China can
**threaten**]{.underline} to coerce [its neighbors, but]{.underline} the
**[water barriers]{.underline}** [separating China from]{.underline}
most of [Asia's strategically important states make outright conquest
significantly **harder**.]{.underline} Of course, as scholars such as
Caitlin Talmadge and Avery Goldstein note, crises may still erupt, and
each side may face pressures to escalate. [Unlike the Cold
War,]{.underline} however, [U.S.-Chinese confrontations occur **at sea**
with]{.underline} relatively [**limited forces** and **without clear
territorial boundaries**.]{.underline} This suggests [there are
**countervailing factors** that may give the two sides **room to
negotiate** --- and **limit the speed with which a crisis
unfolds**]{.underline}. **[3. The Cold War had just two major
powers]{.underline}** The Cold War took place in a bipolar system, with
the United States and Soviet Union uniquely powerful, compared with
other nations. This dynamic often pushed the United States and the
U.S.S.R. toward confrontation and contributed to more or less fixed
alliances; moreover, it encouraged efforts to suppress prospective great
powers, such as Germany. In 2019, it's not at all clear we are back to
bipolarity. Analysts remain divided over whether the U.S. unipolar era
is waning (or is already over) --- and, if so, whether we are heading
for a new period of bipolarity, modern-day multipolarity or something
else. Regardless, most analysts accept that [other countries will play a
central role in East Asian security affairs.]{.underline} Russia, for
example, still benefits from legacy military investments, India is
developing economically and militarily, and Japan is beginning to build
highly capable military forces to complement its still-significant
economic might. Even if these nations aren't as powerful as the United
States or China, their presence makes for more fluid diplomatic
arrangements and more diffuse security concerns than during the
U.S.-Soviet competition. The resulting security dynamics are therefore
likely to look very different. [**4. Ideology plays less of a role in
U.S.-Chinese relations** Many people see the Cold War as an ideological
contest between U.S.-backed liberalism and Soviet-backed
communism.]{.underline} But that's not the whole story. The early 20th
century saw liberalism, communism and fascism vie for ideological
preeminence. With fascism defeated alongside Nazi Germany, the postwar
stage was set for a struggle between communism and liberalism to
reinforce the U.S.-Soviet contest. That each ideology claimed universal
scope ensured that the ideologies served as rallying cries for Third
World conflicts, which were subsequently associated with the U.S.-Soviet
struggle. [The respective **"ideologies"** of the United States and
China do not favor this type of **contest** today.]{.underline} Indeed,
[analysts calling for a hard-line stance]{.underline} against China have
[faced difficulties]{.underline} even [identifying a coherent Chinese
ideological alternative.]{.underline} And while some researchers [claim
that a nascent ideological contest pitting an "autocratic" China against
the "liberal" United States]{.underline} is emerging, this narrative
[ignores the political contests that shape Chinese politics]{.underline}
(and have parallels in U.S. politics)[. **Autocracies and democracies
often coop**erate]{.underline}. And [on one important ideological
issue]{.underline} --- **[how they organize their economic
lives]{.underline}** --- [China and the **U**nited **S**tates have both
embraced economic growth via **trade**, the private sector and semi-free
markets]{.underline}.

[in a context of **permanent crises**. Internally, it is grappling with
the crisis of the **Eurozone**]{.underline} and economic governance,
[the **migration** crisis]{.underline}, the negotiations surrounding
**[Brexit]{.underline}**, and [a creeping]{.underline} but no less
dangerous [challenge to democracy as the core of the Union's shared
values.]{.underline} The manifestations of these crises have been so
prolonged and recurring that they raise the question whether [they
represent **systemic flaws** that call into question the long-term
prospects of European integration]{.underline}. This question has been
posed with relation to European economic and eurozone governance, but is
[equally relevant when it comes to Eurosceptic trends among EU citizens
and the rise of **populist** and nationalist governments that explicitly
challenge core institutions and values of the Union]{.underline}. Brexit
negotiations and the enduring difficulties in finding a workable form of
future cooperation with the UK after the deadline for leaving the Union
further illustrate how some of the core tenets of the EU's order,
including the free movement of people in the internal market, are coming
under pressure. At the same time, [the EU faces a multitude of external
challenges. These range from **the strained transatlantic relationship**
due to the increasingly isolationist stance of the United States, the
**rise of a stronger China**, and an increasingly assertive **Russia**.
The EU's ability to bring positive change to its neighbourhood is
challenged by the enduring instability and outright political crises in
the countries of the Eastern Partnership and those that experienced the
Arab Spring. **These multiple crises challenge the EU's emphasis on soft
power** as its privileged mode of engagement with third countries and
risk fostering ever deeper **Euroscepticism** among the EU's
citizens.]{.underline}
