Trajectory 3 (Negative): Dissolution of NATO

OVERVIEW

[[NATO becomes defunct due to death by a thousand cuts. The gradual
erosion of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[cohesion]{.underline}]{.mark},
political will, credibility, military capability, and relevance of the
alliance described in our baseline scenario [[is
accelerated]{.underline}]{.mark} by several factors. These include an
economic downturn, increasing nationalism and protectionism, [[the
absence of U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[leadership]{.underline}]{.mark},
divergent interests, and threat perceptions, and a disregard for common
values and interests. Defense budgets in the United States and Europe
decrease, and countries prioritize national defense needs over
multilateral solutions. These tensions lead to open conflict among
several Allies, including Greece and Turkey who regularly challenge one
another over their respective activities and rights in the Eastern
Mediterranean. They hold hostage NATO defense plans, training and
exercises, and missions. Still, other allies appear willing to do
China's bidding, for example, by limiting access to key ports and
railways. Finally, adversarial actors calculate that NATO lacks the
political resolve and military capability to fulfill its core tasks,
testing this with several incidents. These include a cyberattack that
takes out the electric grid in several NATO countries; while there is
intelligence that Russia is behind the attack, not all allies deem it
credible, and NATO fails to respond. In another incident, Russia claims
that temporarily breaching Lithuania's territorial integrity is
necessary to defend Belarus. Though disturbed, most allies overlook the
incident to avoid escalation; NATO fails to invoke Article 5, and a
subset of allies respond in Lithuania's defense outside the alliance's
framework.

THREAT AND OPPORTUNITY ENVIRONMENT

Migration, terrorism, climate change, and growing nationalism emerge as
the primary concerns of European NATO allies. These emanate from growing
instability along Europe's periphery and a severe economic downturn,
particularly in southern Europe. While allies recognize the aggressive
nature of some Russian and Chinese behavior, they elect to try to manage
this through a combination of diplomacy, economic leverage, and avoiding
provocative actions. The security environment in Afghanistan
deteriorates rapidly into the tribal and ethnic fragmentation of the
1990s, with regional actors supporting competing militias. This
increases regional instability and causes an outflow of refugees to NATO
countries, especially Turkey. NATO's plans to train Afghan civilians and
the Afghan National Security Forces fall apart as allies fail to stand
by their financial commitments or to provide the necessary trainers due
to force-protection concerns. The Taliban retake the country, and there
is an embarrassing scramble to evacuate the Kabul International Airport
and any remaining NATO civilian or military personnel. NATO's
credibility is weakened even further, both for "abandoning" the Afghan
government and for leaving the country in essentially the same position
as it was when NATO went in in 2003.

While allies recognize the aggressive nature of some Russian and Chinese
behavior, they elect to try to manage this through a combination of
diplomacy, economic leverage, and avoiding provocative actions.

AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE SECURITY PARTNERS

The European Union proves a more effective actor than NATO in countering
the security challenges that most concern European NATO allies (i.e.,
migration, terrorism, climate, and nationalism). Thanks to some European
allies' efforts to limit NATO's role in cybersecurity and defense,
building resilience, and managing emerging and disruptive technologies,
the European Union has also become a viable security actor in these
areas. European allies move away from hedging their security bets
between NATO and the European Union to prioritizing EU defense and
security arrangements outside of NATO. Perceiving the alliance's loss of
relevance even among its own members, like-minded Indo-Pacific partners
disengage with NATO in favor of the European Union or select EU member
states.

ADVERSARY INFLUENCE

Sensing NATO's weakness and U.S. disengagement, China mounts a new charm
offensive to secure access to European markets. Looking to boost their
own struggling economies through trade with China, European countries
are receptive. Russia, sensing its moment to secure sanctions relief and
undercut NATO's raison d'être, behaves more agreeably toward allies that
seek a more cooperative relationship with it in order to reduce their
security burden. This lulls many Europeans into a false sense of
security, and they calculate that---with the United States disengaging
and disinvesting from NATO---the time is ripe for a "grand bargain" with
the Kremlin that involves dissolving the alliance in exchange for a new,
more comprehensive security arrangement. This arrangement precipitates
U.S. military withdrawal from Europe.

SHARED IDENTITY, VALUES, AND INTERESTS

It becomes evident that the notion of a NATO based on shared identity
and values has been an illusion for some time. Populist and nationalist
tendencies that were present when the economy was good accelerate with
the economic downturn. Within NATO and the European Union, democratic
backsliding goes unchecked and creates societal vulnerabilities, such as
corruption, that adversaries exploit. NATO's attractiveness to new
members and credibility as a force for good is damaged by the perception
that it is unable to keep its own house in order. National interests are
pursued at the expense of the collective good.

U.S. LEADERSHIP

The United States decreases its defense budget even as it faces a more
demanding security environment outside of Europe. It loses patience with
European allies' failure to assume their share of the burden, stand up
to Russia and China, or allow NATO to adapt to address new and emerging
security threats. [[The **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[comes to view]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} not as a force multiplier for U.S. influence
and interests, but rather [[as a **burden**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[and
constraint]{.underline}**; [it withdraws significant forces
from]{.underline}]{.mark} Europe and reduces its financial, force, and
capability contributions to NATO.

RESPONSIBILITY SHARING

The economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic brings an end to
consecutive years of growth in NATO defense spending. Only countries
with sizeable domestic defense industries (i.e., the United States,
France, and United Kingdom) maintain higher levels of spending, and the
majority of this is directed not to meeting NATO requirements but rather
to sustaining their own industries. As a result, China and Russia
outpace most allies with respect to emerging defense technologies like
that make use of innovations in artificial intelligence and quantum
computing. Angered by the lack of progress on arms control and shocked
by the escalating cost of nuclear modernization programs, Congress
refuses to fully fund nuclear modernization, undermining extended
deterrence and forcing the United States to reconsider its nuclear
posture in Europe.

NATIONAL DYNAMICS

In response to the economic downturn, countries become more nationalist
and protectionist. National leaders searching for a scapegoat for their
economic and social woes blame multinational organizations, claiming
that they unnecessarily constrain countries' freedom of action---such as
to limit the number of immigrants or to manufacture beyond emissions
limits. Some walk away from their international treaty commitments
(including on climate action, arms control, and human rights) or ignore
their obligations to intergovernmental organizations (such as NATO, the
European Union, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization),
further damaging the credibility of these institutions.

Conclusion

As ever, [[the key to NATO's continued survival will be its
ability]{.underline}]{.mark} to adapt to a changing external security
environment in keeping with the security needs of its members. Merely
raising the level of ambition without ensuring political cohesion and
adequate resources will only undermine the alliance's credibility and
relevance for the next decade.

[[Merely raising the level of ambition without ensuring political
cohesion]{.underline}]{.mark} and adequate resources
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} only **[[undermine the alliance's
credibility and relevance]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the next decade.

An examination of the above potential trajectories can assist NATO
allies in effecting the future they wish to see. While the future is
inherently unpredictable[, [keeping the alliance on the positive
trajectory will require]{.mark} more equitable burden sharing within
NATO; leveraging the competencies of other capable actors,]{.underline}
such as the European Union and [[like-minded global
partners]{.underline}]{.mark}; [[investing in
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} [to maintain NATO's technological
edge]{.underline}; and building resilience to counter adversaries'
attempts to divide the alliance. Conversely, [[**if unity of purpose**
and]{.mark} shared [values **are lost**, the]{.mark} security [burden is
carried by only a few allies,]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[internal
resilience is unaddressed]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [and **[U.S.
leadership is absent]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [NATO will find itself on
the **negative trajectory**]{.underline}]{.mark}. And while the status
quo of "muddling through" may seem good enough for now, it will likely
also land NATO on the negative trajectory over time.

https://quincyinst.org/report/the-dominance-dilemma-the-american-approach-to-nato-and-its-future/#2f8176e0ee4a\]

The United States requires a course correction. [U.S. policy toward NATO
now injects a large degree of instability and unsustainability into the
region,]{.underline} which ironically possesses the preconditions for an
unprecedented degree of stability thanks in part to prior U.S. efforts.
In consequence, the [Biden]{.underline} administration [should
consider]{.underline} proceeding along four tracks, with the goal of
**[significantly reducing]{.underline}** the U.S. **[security presence
via NATO]{.underline}**.

Ending enlargement

In coordination with its partners, the United States should credibly
renounce further NATO enlargement. Whatever one makes of the merits of
America's post--1945 presence in Europe, the gains from further
enlargement are few and the risks substantial. Several pathways exist to
develop a policy of ceasing enlargement. Most directly, the U.S.
government could simply declare it will not support the alliance's
further growth; thanks to NATO's "one state, one vote" procedures, this
would be enough to scuttle a further expansion push. Less unilaterally,
U.S. planners could attempt to craft an intra--NATO consensus that
expansion is no longer worth the costs. Given that many alliance members
have long been skeptical of the merits of expansion --- German
policymakers, for example, were famously ambivalent over the Bucharest
Declaration of 2008, which embraced Ukraine's and Georgia's interest in
NATO membership --- forging a broad front on this agenda ought not be
difficult. Along the way, U.S. and allied diplomats should also seek to
dampen the membership aspirations of those states still outside the
alliance.

**[Cutting troop commitments]{.underline}**

Second, the U.S. government should forgo permanently stationing combat
forces in the Eastern European states admitted to NATO since the Cold
War. Amid mounting calls to bolster the alliance's presence along the
so-called "eastern flank" due to collapsing relations with Moscow, the
U.S. government should encourage European NATO members to bear primary
responsibility for defense obligations east of the Oder--Neisse line.
Not only have NATO's European members taken an active role in the
alliance's ongoing "Enhanced Forward Presence" in Poland and the Baltic
States; there is more than enough latent military capability in the
European portion of the alliance to see this task through.17 For
example, the former members of the Warsaw Pact (excluding Albania and
the Baltic States) that have joined NATO since 1995 have nearly the same
gross domestic product (\$1.55 trillion, measured in 2010 dollars) as
Russia (\$1.76 trillion). Their population, 92 million people versus
Russia's 144 million, is also significant. Add in the other European
members of NATO, and the numbers shift decisively against Russia.
Although non--U.S. military investments in NATO remain underwhelming,
even limited growth in non--U.S. NATO defense capabilities could thus
provide a significant force able to take the lead in Eastern Europe. The
United States should promote this result, with the goal of shifting the
defense burden in Europe to the highly capable states in the area to
reduce U.S. defense obligations.

Rebalancing trans--Atlantic politics

**[The U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [ought to prepare
for a **broader recalibration** of political]{.underline}
[responsibilities in Europe]{.underline}. Precisely because **[the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has other domestic and
international obligations]{.underline}, and because [NATO's European
members are increasingly disenchanted with U.S. predominance, conditions
are ripe to empower the European allies.]{.underline} [The objective
should be to strengthen intra--European solidarity and]{.underline}
**[coop]{.underline}**eration while the United States steps back from
active management of European security. The United States should pivot
toward becoming the pacifier of last resort rather than the manager of
early squabbles.

The objective should be to strengthen intra-European solidarity and
cooperation while the United States steps back from active management of
European security.

There are reasons to believe this result is attainable. Many of NATO's
major European players, especially France and Germany, have deepened
cooperation in both NATO and non--NATO contexts such as the EU over the
past several decades. Disenchantment with U.S. dominance and lingering
concerns about Russia provide incentives for sustained cooperation even
with a significantly reduced American presence. The United States ought
to lean into these trends, returning to its vision of the early postwar
years by reducing, limiting, and making more conditional the U.S.
presence in the alliance. Over time, such steps could lay the foundation
for a comprehensive American withdrawal, providing that Europe remains
stable and open to U.S. influence when U.S. interests are involved. Nor
would such a retrenchment sacrifice long-term U.S. interests: Should
intra--European tensions spike without an American pacifier, America's
lingering connection to the alliance would enable the United States to
reengage as needed.

Reengaging with Russia

The United States needs to find a path toward engaging Russia and
stabilizing bilateral ties and NATO--Russia relations. This will prove
no small feat. Any opening to Russia will inevitably encounter vigorous
domestic political opposition in the wake of Russian meddling in U.S.
electoral politics. Nevertheless, there is much to be gained from
engagement. Russia remains the most significant state against which the
United States might feel compelled to go to war on NATO's behalf. The
irony cannot be overstated: The Russian threat to European and American
security is miniscule unless the United States and Russia are actively
engaged in a shooting war. Given Europe's peacefulness, and its interest
in sustained cooperation without American oversight, the United States
can promote allied interests and serve its own security requirements by
finding a way forward with Moscow. To be sure, the failure of President
Obama's attempted "reset" with Moscow urges caution as to how much can
be accomplished with Russia.18 Nevertheless, given the risks of
continued tensions to both countries, the stabilization of flashpoints
such as the Ukraine crisis over the last several years, the limits of
deterrence and defense on NATO's eastern flank, Russia's mounting
economic pressures, and America's evident desire to devote increased
attention to Asia, U.S. outreach to Moscow is timely and could prove
fruitful.

Conclusion

It is easy to get wrapped up in the rhetorical shifts and policy
particulars of the moment, but [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has consistently approached NATO through
a]{.underline} [combination of **opportunism** and
**geopolitics**]{.underline}. Since the alliance's creation in the late
1940s, the United States has attempted to strike a balance between its
own contradictory impulses. Going forward, the question is whether this
balance is sustainable in practice, if not in declared intent, given the
emerging shape of international politics. It is not defeatist to be
skeptical. **[Alliance commitments tend to change when new threats
appear]{.underline}** [and strategic priorities shift]{.underline}. As
America's attention moves toward Asia, its longstanding attitudes toward
European security should be reevaluated and accorded lower strategic
priority.

**Lucas '22** \[Edward; June 7; nonresident fellow at the Center for
European Policy Analysis, a Liberal Democratic candidate for the British
Parliament, a former senior editor at The Economist; Foreign Policy,
"NATO Is Out of Shape and Out of Date,"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/07/nato-ukraine-russia-war-alliance-reform-geopolitics-military/\]

Is NATO brain-dead or back in business? Less than three years ago,
French President Emmanuel Macron famously diagnosed "the brain death of
NATO." Rhetoric aside, his point was fair at the time: Europe's dearth
of strategic thinking combined with the unpredictability of U.S. policy
under then-President Donald Trump spelled serious trouble for the Cold
War-era alliance.

Now, all talk is of NATO's revival and resurgence. Russia's war on
Ukraine has given an urgent new relevance to the bloc's core mission of
territorial defense. NATO members appear to have found a new unity of
purpose, supplying Ukraine with weapons, reassessing the threat from
Russia, hiking defense budgets, and bolstering the security of the
alliance's eastern frontier. But the "honeymoon," in the words of
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis, was brief. As the
war drags on, strains are showing, and the alliance is still shaky.

It's true that NATO has come a long way. Only 14 years ago, the
alliance's top-secret threat assessment body, MC 161, was explicitly
prohibited by its political masters from even considering any military
danger from Russia in its scenarios. The pressure came not only from
notorious Russia-huggers such as Germany but also from the United
States, which was eager to keep east-west ties friendly. The Kremlin,
the conventional wisdom insisted, was a partner, not an enemy. As a
result, NATO's most vulnerable members---Poland and the Baltic states of
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania---remained second-class allies. They were
in the bloc, but only on paper. There were no significant outside forces
on their territory, and the alliance expressly refrained from making
contingency plans to reinforce or even defend them in the event of
attack. Poland demanded such plans and was told that they could be drawn
up to defend the country against an attack by Belarus---but not by
Russia.

Since Russia's first attack on Ukraine in 2014, NATO plans and
deployments have become more serious. There are 1,000-strong tripwire
forces in the three Baltic states and a larger U.S. force in Poland.
Since the start of the invasion in February, that presence has increased
sharply. Moreover, two of the most advanced smaller military powers in
Europe, Finland and Sweden, are banging on the alliance's door. Assuming
objections from Turkey can been smoothed out, they will be members by
year's end. That will fundamentally change the military geography of
northeastern Europe.

Still more important is the stiffening of spines among the members.
Trump's much publicized distaste for NATO was based, in part, on the
European members' chronic underspending. At one point, the exasperated
U.S. leader even tried to present a bill to his German counterpart,
Chancellor Angela Merkel. Now, defense spending is rising across the
alliance. That makes NATO an easier sell in Washington, especially as
the case for U.S. engagement in European security is bolstered by the
war in Ukraine.

Germany, the most notorious laggard, is suddenly splurging money on its
decrepit armed forces---tanks that can't trundle, ships that can't go to
sea, and soldiers who exercise with broomsticks instead of guns. It has
agreed to meet NATO's defense spending benchmark of 2 percent of GDP,
set in 2006 and largely ignored thereafter. The latest country to
announce a big hike in defense spending is Spain, currently lagging at
barely 1 percent of GDP. The prime minister announced that this will
double by 2024. That sets the scene nicely for the NATO summit in the
Spanish capital later this month.

Yet look a little more closely, and the picture is far less rosy.
Notwithstanding its apparent unity of purpose since the start of
Russia's war, NATO looks out of shape and out of date. In the run-up to
their summit, the allies have been furiously haggling over the language
in their new strategic concept, which will frame the alliance's mission
for the coming years and will be unveiled in Madrid. What will it say
about Russia? About China? What sacrifices and risks are the member
states really willing to accept? Are they willing to pool sovereignty in
order to streamline decision-making?

Nothing in recent weeks suggests that these questions will get clear
answers. For starters, the 30-strong alliance is unwieldy. In military
terms, only a handful of members matter---above all, the United
States---but in political terms, even little Luxembourg and Iceland get
a voice. Worse, the political divides are huge. Turkey under President
Recep Tayyip Erdogan is a semi-authoritarian state that flirts with
Russia and fumes at what it considers European meddling over human
rights. Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orban is taking a different
but downward path, fusing wealth and power into a new system of control
at home and undermining U.S. and European attempts to put pressure on
Russia and China. Macron's relentless posturing and German Chancellor
Olaf Scholz's foot-dragging create constant obstacles and distractions.
The two leader's weaknesses, on glorious display since the start of the
war, have already enriched the language: Scholzen is a German neologism
for "dither," while makronic in Polish (and its equivalent in Ukrainian)
can be roughly translated as "vacuous grandstanding while doing
nothing."

Macron and Scholz corrode decision-making with their foibles and thus
place a big question mark over the alliance's credibility and cohesion.
Any threat or provocation from Russia is unlikely to be clear or
conveniently timed. More likely it will be something deliberately
ambiguous, such as a Russian drone that "accidentally" strays onto the
territory of a front-line state and hits a target. Some countries would
favor a tough response. Others would fear escalation and want dialogue.
Still others would take the ambiguity as a convenient excuse to do
nothing. Would the 30---soon to be 32---national representatives in the
North Atlantic Council, the alliance's deliberative body, really make a
speedy and tough decision on how to react? More likely, some of them
would plead for delay, diplomacy, and compromise. Those actually facing
the possibility of attack would be far more hawkish, preferring a sharp
military confrontation to even the smallest Russian victory. "Not one
inch, not one soul," a senior military figure from one of the Baltic
states, speaking anonymously, told me. "We have seen what they did in
Ukraine."

The political weaknesses are matched by military ones. By far the most
important country in the alliance is the United States. The U.S.
security guarantee to Europe---with its threat of devastating
conventional and, if necessary, nuclear response to any attack---is the
cornerstone of the alliance. "All for one and one for all" sounds fine,
but nobody in the Kremlin will tremble at the thought of Spanish, Dutch,
or Canadian displeasure. Yet the result of this is a colossal dependence
on U.S. capabilities, ranging from ammunition and spare parts (of which
European countries' stockpiles are notoriously skinny) to military
transports that move forces quickly and efficiently over long distances.
Even if Europe's new defense spending plans materialize, they will not
change the fact that only U.S. armed forces can move with the scale and
speed necessary to defend territory from a country like Russia.

Conversely, the countries that most need defending---Estonia, Latvia,
and Lithuania---are the least able to bear the burden themselves. They
need advanced weapons, particularly for air and missile defense, that
they cannot afford themselves. The thin neck of land along the
Polish-Lithuanian border, the so-called Suwalki Gap, is particularly
vulnerable to attack from Russia's militarized Kaliningrad exclave and
Belarus, from which Russia attacked Ukraine. Poland and Lithuania both
want a big U.S. military presence---either a permanent base or a
persistent rotation of forces---to safeguard this strategic chokepoint.

Yet NATO command structures and planning do not fully reflect the
imbalance of forces between the United States and Europe. They rely on
the fiction that the European allies are more or less equal partners.
Even military lightweights need to have important-sounding jobs and
installations, making the North Atlantic Council the military version of
a parliament dividing out the pork.

The resulting command structure is like a tangled pile of spaghetti. In
the Baltic region alone, NATO has several multinational headquarters,
one divisional headquarters split between Latvia and Denmark, another
divisional headquarters in Poland, and a corps headquarters at a
different location in Poland. Overall responsibility for the defense of
Europe is divided between three Joint Forces Command headquarters in
Naples, Italy; Brunssum, the Netherlands; and Norfolk, Virginia. But the
top U.S. military commander in Europe, Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, is
based at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in Mons, Belgium. A
maritime strategy for the Baltic Sea region has yet to be
decided---which is just as well, because NATO has yet to create a naval
headquarters for the region. Nor has the alliance drawn up real military
plans for the reinforcement and defense of its northeastern members, let
alone decided who would actually provide the forces and equipment in
order to make them credible. Military mobility is meant to be the
responsibility of Joint Support and Enabling Command, headquartered in
Ulm, Germany, and originally set up as part of the European Union's own
defense policy.

A further problem is exercises: **[NATO]{.underline}** [does not conduct
fully **realistic**]{.underline}, large-scale rehearsals of how it would
respond to a Russian attack. One problem is that these are costly and
disruptive. Another is that they expose the huge weaknesses of some NATO
members, which can cope with a carefully scripted exercise but lack the
ability to improvise. A third reason is the fear, in some countries,
that practicing war-fighting would be provocative. Also lacking are
detailed plans for fighting a war against Russia, covering such issues
as reinforcing of front-line states, countering a Russian attack,
regaining any temporarily occupied territory, and---most of
all---dealing with a nuclear or other escalation. As a result, nobody is
quite sure how anything would work in a crisis. Instead, another
assumption reigns: that in a crisis, the United States would take over
and do the heavy lifting on all fronts---logistics, intelligence, and
combat.

To be fair, NATO is working on these problems, and all of them are
fixable. But that does not mean that they are anywhere near being fixed.
Wishful thinking remains the alliance's besetting sin.

Worse, [NATO is unprepared for the changing nature of modern
warfar]{.underline}e. Russia's old-style assault on Ukraine is all too
familiar. But the artillery bombardments and missile strikes that are
grinding down Ukraine's defenses are only part of the Kremlin's arsenal.
[Its most effective weapons are nonmilitary]{.underline}: subversion,
diplomatic divide-and-rule tactics, [economic coercion]{.underline},
[corruption, and propaganda]{.underline}. The most burning current
example of nonmilitary warfare is Russia's weaponizing of hunger. By
blocking Ukraine's grain exports, Russia has raised the specter of
famine over millions of people, including in volatile and fragile
countries in North Africa and the Middle East. Mass starvation is not
just a humanitarian catastrophe, but its consequences include political
unrest and mass migration, a direct threat to Europe. Yet NATO is
ill-equipped to deal with this. It cannot mandate more economical use of
grain---for example, by feeding less to livestock and stopping grain's
conversion to fuel. It has no food stockpiles to release to a hungry
world. It cannot build new railways to ship Ukrainian grain through
other routes. Nor can it insure merchant vessels that might---for a
price---be willing to run Russia's Black Sea blockade. NATO has little
in-house expertise in countering Russian disinformation and almost zero
influence in African and other countries susceptible to Kremlin
narratives blaming the West for the food shortages that are already
starting now.

NATO could acquire these capabilities. Or it could regain them: During
the Cold War, the alliance had an economic warfare division and ran a
program called the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export
Controls to prevent the Soviet bloc from acquiring sensitive
technologies. But in the strategic timeout that followed the collapse of
the Soviet bloc, these agencies and their skill sets shriveled and died.

But as with NATO's military shortcomings, identifying the problems is
not the same as solving them. And **[given the bloc's unwieldy
structure]{.underline}** and issues with key members, [it might be wise
to lower expectations about NATO returning to Cold War levels of
consistent readiness and effectiveness.]{.underline} A more realistic
vision for the alliance would be to treat it as a framework for the most
capable and threat-aware members to form coalitions of the willing.
These groupings already exist: The British-led Joint Expeditionary
Force, for example, is a 10-country framework for military cooperation,
chiefly aimed at enabling very rapid deployments to the Nordic-Baltic
region in the event of a crisis. France has a similar venture, the
European Intervention Initiative. The five Nordic states have their own
military club, called the Nordic Defence Cooperation, while Poland has
close bilateral ties with Lithuania. A similar network of bilateral and
multilateral ties would greatly strengthen the alliance's floundering
presence in the Black Sea and other regions, including North Africa and
the Eastern Mediterranean. These groupings would not supplant NATO but
improve action and interoperability on top of the alliance's established
structures and mechanisms.

The difficult and underlying question here is the role of the United
States. Europe is, in theory, big and rich enough to manage its own
defense. But its persistent political weakness prevents that. The
paradox is that [only U.S. involvement makes NATO
credible]{.underline}---yet overdependence on the United States also
undermines the alliance's credibility, while stoking resentment in
France and elsewhere. The task for Washington is to encourage European
allies to shoulder more of the burden and start thinking strategically
again, even as it retains the superpower involvement that gives the
alliance its decisive military edge. That is entirely doable. But don't
expect it to happen in Madrid---or anytime soon.

never re-elected, some of his political allies]{.underline}, and even
other potential presidential candidates like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis,
[have adopted a similarly skeptical or even hostile view of European
alliances]{.underline} that might lead them to consider it.

The threat of a president pursuing NATO withdrawal over the objections
of Congress and the American public is not empty. While the Constitution
is silent on the issue, the mainstream legal view is that the president
has the authority to withdraw the United States from treaties pursuant
to their terms, without any input from Congress. Trump acted on this
authority multiple times, as did several of his predecessors. [Efforts
to challenge these withdrawals in court have failed on technical
grounds, leaving the president's claim of authority
undisturbed.]{.underline}

In NATO's case, Article 13 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that a
member state may withdraw one year after its government gives notice to
the United States, which would inform the other member governments. This
means [a future president could **initiate**]{.underline}
[**withdrawal** and **complete it** within a single term in
office]{.underline}.

NATO's Future and U.S. Leadership

Although NATO seems perpetually in crisis, it has shown a remarkable
ability to pursue strategic goals and maintain operational effectiveness
even after its original mission of containing the Soviet Union
disappeared. It has incorporated 14 new members from across Central and
Eastern Europe since the end of the Cold War. It contained and reversed
Serbian aggression in the western Balkans in the 1990s. It sustained a
long-term presence in Afghanistan. It has delivered humanitarian
assistance in far-flung locales such as Indonesia. It demonstrated
solidarity in the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine. And it
continues to be viewed favorably among most member states.

While maintaining its deterrence posture vis-à-vis Russia will remain
alliance's raison d'etre, the COVID-19 pandemic and the longer-term
challenges posed by China will present stern tests for NATO. [[The
alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} is well-equipped to handle crises and
[[could even emerge stronger]{.underline}]{.mark} from the pandemic,
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} part of **[[that will depend on developments
in Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

If a new American president takes office in January 2021, his
administration has an opportunity to rethink burden-sharing and redefine
national security to include resilience in the face of disruptive
shocks. These include not only the immediate shock of the pandemic but
longer-term disruptions that will be posed by issues like climate change
and artificial intelligence. A first step would be to shift from talking
about the need for members to meet the 2 percent threshold on defense
spending to talking about how NATO --- working with the European Union
--- can bolster the security of the citizens of its member states by
increasing capacity to manage a range of threats. And while NATO is less
suited as an institution to foster toward China the type of common
strategy it has maintained vis-à-vis Russia, it can play a role as a
forum for discussion.

[[Core to NATO's future is its standing as an
alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} of democracies, particularly
[[given]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[its]{.underline}]{.mark} principal
strategic [[competitors are China and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, major
authoritarian powers. That has been put to the test by illiberal trends
in countries like Turkey, Hungary, and Poland. NATO does not have
provisions for suspending or expelling members, but member states can
speak loudly on behalf of democratic values and use their bilateral
relationships to pressure authoritarian rulers.

To address all of these issues, however,
**[[rebuilding]{.underline}]{.mark}** democratic norms and
**[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the United States [[will be a
**key initial step**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Any prescriptions for NATO's
future depend first and foremost on a U.S. president who believes in
democracy and alliances. [[Without one, **NATO risks having no future at
all**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### No Cohesion Now\-\--2NC

#### NATO is disunified now -- Trump-era ideals are cemented in government and Europe is too [economically integrated]{.underline} with Russia.

-- OBERTO

As Joe Biden meets with European counterparts in Brussels today, the
leader of an ostensibly reunited free world, it is worth recalling
another NATO summit just five years ago, held under very different
circumstances, with a very different U.S. president.

[In 2017,]{.underline} ahead of talks with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki,
Donald [[Trump]{.mark} arrived in the Belgian capital. He was on the
**[rampage over European free riding, German double-dealing, and
European Union tariffs]{.mark}** on American companies, at one point
getting his national security adviser, John Bolton, on the
line.]{.underline} "**[Are you ready to play in the big leagues
today]{.underline}**?" Trump asked. [The president]{.underline} said he
[would [threaten to leave NATO]{.mark} unless every country in the
alliance committed to spending 2 percent of its GDP on defense and
Germany scrapped a pipeline deal with Moscow.]{.underline}

In Trump's mind, [the United States was being [asked to defend
Europe]{.mark} from Russia, [while Europe enriched Russia]{.mark} by
buying its oil and gas]{.underline}. At the same time, [[the EU]{.mark}
was to him a protectionist trade bloc [competing
with]{.mark}]{.underline}, and making life difficult for, [[American
firms]{.underline}]{.mark}. Where was the U.S. national interest in
continuing this charade? After he took his seat at the summit, Trump
summoned Bolton over to his table. "Are we going to do it?" he asked.
Bolton urged him not to. "I returned to my seat not knowing what he was
going to do," he writes in The Room Where It Happened.

The president ultimately did not follow through on his plan, and the
alliance held. [[With his successor]{.mark} now [in
town]{.mark}]{.underline} to discuss the Western response to
Russia's [invasion of
Ukraine](https://www.theatlantic.com/category/russias-invasion-ukraine/),
an assault that has suddenly reinvigorated NATO, [[it is easy]{.mark}
[to forget]{.mark} the disharmony of the [Trump]{.mark}
years]{.underline}, all that led up to it, and the very real prospect
that Trump or one of his ideological acolytes could be back in the White
House by 2025. [Trump]{.underline}, after all, [was [far from the
first]{.mark} American [to **complain about Europe**]{.mark}'s lack of
commitment to Western security: Barack Obama had criticized NATO members
for being "free riders," while Europe and the U.S. had split badly over
Iraq.]{.underline}

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, however, and Germany's
revolution in its foreign policy---finally putting on hold the Nord
Stream 2 pipeline and committing to the 2 percent defense-spending
target---it can appear as though **[Putin has succeeded where Obama and
Trump failed]{.underline}**. And so, after the years of Trumpian
disorder, all is well, right? The West, thanks to Russian aggression,
has finally reunited and rebalanced, ready to challenge authoritarians
everywhere. **[Don't bet on it]{.underline}**. [[The problems in the
Western alliance run]{.mark} far [deeper than technocratic complaints
about **defense budgets** and **gas pipelines**]{.mark}, or even the
brooding figure of Trump himself.]{.underline}

[When faced with an invasion]{.underline}, as we are seeing in Ukraine,
[NATO members have found unity to be easy]{.underline}: Core national
interests are at stake. [But as the current sense of shock and disgust
gives way to the usual pressures of political and economic cycles, does
the West agree on what lessons should be drawn from this crisis? Does it
collectively know what it stands for---and whom it stands
against?]{.underline}

[During the Cold War, these questions had relatively clear
answers]{.underline}. The West was the free world, standing for
democracy, and opposed to communism. Its leading power was the U.S.; its
principal enemy was the Soviet Union. There wasn't much trade between
East and West, and so the basic obligation of being part of NATO was
straightforward: to come to the aid of any other member attacked.

[Today, the same structure remains, but [the world is more
complicated]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since the end of the Cold War, [the
West has helped build a global economy based on the notion that trade is
not political]{.underline}---that [economics can be separated from
foreign policy and national security]{.underline}. This belief has been
[undergirded by the idea that by building this world, Russia, China, and
others would automatically become more liberal and democratic, resulting
in a harmonious world in which everyone benefited]{.underline}.

[This analysis turned out to be completely wrong. [Trade with Russia has
not made it any less threatening to **European security**. Trade with
China has made it **richer and more powerful**]{.mark}**,** but not more
liberal or democratic.]{.underline} As Hillary
Clinton [wrote](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/republicans-ukraine-putin-xi-trump-democracy/622898/) recently,
[China---not Russia---is now "[the greatest long-term challenge to the
**future of democracy**]{.mark}."]{.underline}

In Washington, Clinton's view is part of the mainstream. But does Europe
see it that way? If it does, surely there has to be a shared approach to
the threat, creating closer economic unity within the West to reflect
the new reality that trade cannot be separated from geopolitics. If it
does not, a future President Trump or one of his followers will pose the
same set of questions Trump posed about Russia in 2017: Why are we
defending these guys if they are not on our side in the main fight?

Right now, [despite the impressive unity within the West over Ukraine,
[we can see the limits to how much pain Europe is prepared to
endure]{.mark} to pressure Russia. [German]{.mark}
Chancellor]{.underline} Olaf Scholz has [warned that he [will not agree
to a total ban on Russian energy]{.mark} imports]{.underline}, which, he
said, would mean "plunging our country and all of Europe into a
recession." [If disengaging with Russia is this hard, [imagine]{.mark}
[how difficult it will be to find a Western consensus to oppose
China]{.mark}, a far more powerful and economically important
country.]{.underline}

[[Ideological incoherence]{.mark} is the [main threat to the
West]{.mark}ern alliance]{.underline}, but a [close second can be found
in the West's imperial center---the U.S.]{.underline} And here, again,
we return to [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}. The essence of his complaint
about Europe was not simply that it was not contributing enough; it was
that he [[didn't]{.mark} really [believe in the U.S.-led order]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}. Trump [believed the whole structure was [unfair to
the U.S.:]{.mark}]{.underline} Why should it shoulder most of the burden
of policing the world? But the thing with orders---liberal,
"rules-based," or any other---is that they need ordering, and this is
the job of the hegemon. [Burdens can be better shared, and Europe can do
more to free America for its contest with China, but ultimately the U.S.
either guarantees European security or it doesn't.]{.underline}

[[Biden will]{.mark} undoubtedly [speak]{.mark} a [familiar]{.mark}
language [to European leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}---[one of liberal
values and the defense of democracy]{.underline}, and that will be
comforting to them. But [the question that nevertheless troubles
European politicians, diplomats, and officials is whether instead of
[Trump]{.mark} being an eccentric one-off, his [instinctive
antagonism]{.mark} to the obligations of global leadership [represents a
trend in American public opinion]{.mark} more generally]{.underline}.
The question that follows is whether the U.S. has the political will to
be the hegemonic power it has been since the end of the Second World
War, the basis on which the Western world functions.

As one former NATO insider put it to me, [the alliance's strength is its
strategic capability]{.underline}, and [this is possible only because
the U.S. dominates it]{.underline}. An alliance of lots of similar-size
states would not be the same: It would be the European Union---a
worthwhile political and trade bloc, but not a capable military
grouping. What happens if Washington decides it no longer wants the role
of leader?

One somewhat counterintuitive conclusion from the past 20 years is that,
if anything, America's relative dominance over Europe has grown, not
declined. After the financial crash, it was the Federal Reserve that
stepped in to become the global lender of last resort, while Europe
descended into a set of rolling crises. The fundamentals of U.S.
economic strength remain extraordinary: the dollar, Silicon Valley,
America's universities, Wall Street. Europe lags behind on all of these,
and Germany's sudden commitment to additional defense spending will do
little to bridge the yawning security gap.

The reality is that [the West functions as an American-led alliance, but
it is not clear that Europe entirely agrees on America's principal
strategic threats. Whether Trump returns to the White House or Biden is
the one who returns to some future NATO summit, there will come a point
when Europe and the U.S. must decide whether and how to renew their
alliance for the next challenge]{.underline}---be that Russia, or China,
or something else entirely. And if they do, [it will take far more than
a small uptick in defense spending and a change in energy policy to keep
them united.]{.underline}

### Cohesion Link\-\--2NC

#### Political cohesion is NATO's last straw -- a lack of cohesion opens the door for Russia, allows multilateralism, and impedes NATO military tasks.

accessed 6-20-2022 -- OBERTO!

**[Why Political Cohesion Matters]{.underline}**

[[NATO is a community of sovereign states]{.mark}, each with its own
geography, interests, and political outlook]{.underline}. In this
respect, [it is no surprise that [complete harmony is
**impossible**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that [[the alliance has
experienced]{.mark} periods of [tension and
divergence]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the late 1960s and early 1970s,
[NATO [faced a test]{.mark} of its values as it debated how to deal
[with growing authoritarianism]{.mark} in Portugal and Greece
[and]{.mark} multiple [coups]{.mark} in Turkey]{.underline}. Ultimately,
[[members decided not to address the problem]{.underline}]{.mark},
instead **[[prioritizing [cohesion and geopolitical
interests](https://warontherocks.com/2017/08/how-to-deal-with-authoritarianism-inside-nato/)]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
that tense Cold War period. Yet for several reasons, [[the situation is
different this time]{.mark} and should be dealt with
urgently.]{.underline}

First, [an [inattention to]{.mark} the principles of [democracy,
individual liberty, and the rule of law]{.mark} in a member country
[creates]{.mark} [societal
[vulnerabilities]{.mark}](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/07/10/an-inconvenient-truth-addressing-democratic-backsliding-within-nato/)[ that
competitors can exploit]{.mark}. [Russia]{.mark}, for example, [preys
on]{.mark} the [grievances]{.mark} of racial and ethnic minorities [in
NATO member countries]{.mark} in order [to weaken **national-level
governance and cohesion**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Likewise, [a
[compromised media environment allows ]{.mark}[[disinformation]{.mark}
campaigns](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mind-gaps-assessing-russian-influence-united-kingdom) [to
flourish]{.mark}]{.underline},
while [[[corruption](https://www.csis.org/features/kremlin-playbook-2) opens
space for Russian networks]{.mark} to operate and gain influence. Even
[allies with strong democratic institutions]{.mark},]{.underline} such
as Germany, [[are increasingly targets]{.mark} of [Russian
disinformation
campaigns](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-russia-germany/germany-is-main-target-of-russian-disinformation-eu-says-idUSKBN2B11CX)]{.underline}.
In these ways, [a deficit in internal values quickly becomes an external
security threat.]{.underline}

Second, [**[waning attention to NATO's core values]{.mark}** has
[resulted in]{.mark} some [allies moving away from
upholding]{.mark}]{.underline} the North Atlantic
Treaty [commitment](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm) to
promote "[[peaceful and friendly international
relations]{.underline}.]{.mark}" In practice, this means [[member
countries]{.mark} are more willing to [pursue national decisions]{.mark}
even [when they run against]{.mark} NATO's **[collective
interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Examples include [[Turkey's
invasion]{.mark} of Northeast Syria without the consultation of allies
[and]{.mark} its [acquisition of]{.mark} the [Russian]{.mark} S-400
[missile system]{.mark} even though it can undermine NATO integrated air
defense.]{.underline}

Finally, [[lack of respect for **NATO principles**]{.mark} has
[empowered member states to bring **bilateral disputes** into the
alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}, as was the case in 2019, [when [Hungary
accused]{.mark} NATO partner [Ukraine of mistreating ethnic
Hungarians]{.mark}]{.underline} living in western Ukraine based on
Ukraine's introduction of a restrictive language law. [Rather than
tackling the issue bilaterally, [Hungary brought it **into the
alliance**, blocking Ukraine's]{.mark} NATO [Membership]{.mark} Action
[Plan]{.mark} and cancelling meetings of the NATO-Ukraine Commission.
**[Internal tensions]{.mark} can also [negatively affect NATO's military
tasks]{.mark},**]{.underline} as recently witnessed when [Turkey
blocked](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-summit-turkey-exclusive/exclusive-turkey-holds-up-nato-military-plans-over-syria-dispute-sources-idUSKBN1Y01W0) a
defense plan for the Baltic States and Poland on the grounds that NATO
did not recognize the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) as a
terrorist organization.

[Ever since its foundation in 1949]{.underline}, the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**) has [had a
straightforward strategy]{.underline} to maintain peace in Europe:
["keep the Soviet Union out, the United States in, and the
Germans [down](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_137930.htm),".]{.underline}
For the past 70 years, [this [strategy has been]{.mark} incredibly
[successful]{.mark}, preventing interstate wars]{.underline} between its
member nations, [forcing the United States to maintain a large military
presence in Europe,]{.underline} and [keeping the Soviet Union
isolated]{.underline}, eventually [leading to their total collapse.
[However]{.mark}, in recent years,]{.underline} **[[NATO has been
suffering from a crisis of purpose]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [many of
[its members are no longer convinced]{.mark} of [the value of being in
the alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the most inflammatory example
of this has been President Donald [Trump's position that NATO has become
"[obsolete](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/world/europe/trump-nato-summit-latvia-baltics.html)]{.underline}",
the truth is that [[the organization is facing serious **structural
problems**]{.mark} that are [inhibiting]{.mark} its ability to ensure
European **[security]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In 2014, the pro-Russian Ukrainian government was toppled by a massive
protest movement. In the chaotic aftermath, [[Russian special forces
seized]{.mark} the strategically significant state of
[Crimea]{.mark}]{.underline} and helped two eastern states break off and
form an independent
pro-Russian [nation](https://www.vox.com/2014/9/3/18088560/ukraine-everything-you-need-to-know).
Ever since, [[Ukraine]{.mark} has been engaged in a protracted "**[soft
war]{.mark}**"]{.underline} against militias and secret military units,
supplied and armed by Russia, that has lead to the deaths of tens of
thousands and been a constant source of instability
in [Kiev](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/ukraine-is-fighting-a-war-and-an-internal-battle-against-corruption).
While Ukraine is not a member of NATO and is therefore not subject to
its protections, [Russia's [aggressive actions]{.mark} have [made
neighboring nations fearful]{.mark} of being next on the target
list,]{.underline} consequently dividing the military alliance on how to
secure it's eastern front from it's old enemy.

Case in point, [[Germany was once the frontline]{.mark} against the
Soviet Union]{.underline} during the Cold War. However, with [the
dissolution of the USSR, [it is now separated]{.mark} from its successor
state Russia [by]{.mark} nations such as [Poland, Ukraine, and the
Baltic States]{.mark}, and it no [longer faces a]{.mark} direct physical
[threat]{.mark} from the Red Army]{.underline}. As a result,
[[Germany]{.mark} has [slashed]{.mark} its spending
on [[defense](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/world/europe/germany-nato-spending-target.html),
disbanded]{.mark} dozens of **[brigades]{.mark}**, and **[resisted
calls]{.mark}**]{.underline} by the US and those same former-Soviet
nations [[to provide]{.mark} concrete **[military
support]{.mark}**]{.underline} to shore up NATO's new front line in the
east from recent
Russian [aggression](https://www.dw.com/en/poland-more-aligned-to-us-than-to-european-partners/a-50232484).
Although the two are not consistently cooperative allies,
[[Germany's]{.mark} economic [growth]{.mark} and subsequent need for
more markets]{.underline} have [driven it to [engage in]{.mark} more
**[long-term coop]{.mark}**eration [with Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline}
For example, [while it has sanctioned Russia]{.underline} over its
invasion of
eastern [Ukraine](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/eastern-europe-caucasus/germany-s-real-role-ukraine-crisis),
[it has also [partnered with Moscow to build]{.mark} a massive new
pipeline in[ **[Nord Stream
2]{.mark}**](https://www.dw.com/en/nord-stream-2-russian-gas-and-geopolitics/av-49292113)]{.underline},
which would compound Europe's energy dependence on the east, [and has
[continually]{.mark} tried to [negotiate to remove]{.mark} those same
[sanctions]{.mark}
on [Russia](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-russia-eu/eu-divisions-over-russia-mount-as-france-germany-seek-peace-in-ukraine-idUSKCN1WL04D).]{.underline}
[NATO members [France, Italy, Hungary and Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline},
just to name a few, [have also shown themselves to be [hesitant]{.mark}
[to categorize Russia as
an[ enemy](https://time.com/5564207/russia-nato-relationship/)]{.mark} and
blocked moves within the organization to mobilize more resources and
forces to counter]{.underline} the perceived threat from [the
east.]{.underline}

On the other hand, ever since Russia's 2014 invasion of eastern Ukraine,
NATO
members[[[ Poland](https://www.realclearworld.com/articles/2019/06/10/in_poland_a_fixed_us_presence_will_warrant_a_russian_response_113034.html) and[ Romania](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-romania-russia/nato-member-romania-warns-of-increased-russian-activity-in-black-sea-idUSKCN1MK2EP)]{.mark} have
been front and center]{.underline} in trying to resist Russian pressure
imposed on former Soviet nations. While NATO nations have joined
together to condemn and sanction Russia for its actions as well as
rotate more troops into Poland and the Baltic countries for training
exercises, these [eastern nations have long been [demanding]{.mark}
something more concrete: [permanently stationed [armed
brigades]{.mark}](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/10/14/on-the-borders-of-putins-baltic-fortress-lithuania-cheers-the-build-up-of-us-forces-in-the-baltics/)]{.underline}.
These nations believe that [current [NATO actions]{.mark} are [wildly
insufficient]{.mark} to counter the growing Russian threat,]{.underline}
and have become increasingly exasperated at the lack of concerted action
taken by the alliance. [[The **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates is
also in agreement]{.underline} and has [continually been
[frustrated]{.mark} by NATO members' lack of military preparedness and
investment in their
own [defense](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/14/politics/nato-defense-spending-target/index.html)]{.underline}.
Even though the old days of the Cold War are long gone, [US foreign
policy still identifies Russia as an enemy to be contained,]{.underline}
and has
been [eager](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-usa-defence/deploying-u-s-troops-in-poland-wholly-defensive-ambassador-says-in-riposte-to-russia-idUSKCN1TI1KL) to
support former-Soviet nations defending themselves against Putin's
ambitions. However, as all matters of [[policy and military deployment
have to be made
by [consensus](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49178.htm)]{.mark} from
NATO's 29 members]{.underline}, and with [wildly divergent priorities
from all sides, [members]{.mark} have increasingly taken to simply
[bypassing]{.mark} the [NATO decision-making process]{.mark} entirely
and pursuing bilateral or trilateral negotiation.]{.underline}

[In the face of increasing Russian pressure]{.underline} [and a lack of
concerted action by NATO, [Poland]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[reached out
to the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates directly for
protection]{.underline}. After a relatively short negotiation period,
[the US has deployed two new infantry brigades to Polish bases,
strengthened its armored contingent in the region]{.underline}, and
[agreed on a plan to build a new forward-deployment base in Poland which
would house an additional[ 1,000 US
troops](https://www.realclearworld.com/articles/2019/06/10/in_poland_a_fixed_us_presence_will_warrant_a_russian_response_113034.html)]{.underline}.
With the speed at which these decisions were taken, **[[other nations
have fallen into a similar pattern of
negotiations.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Just last month,
[[Romania]{.underline}]{.mark} [announced](https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-rebuild-mihail-kogalniceanu-military-base) that
it was going to build a new military base close to the Black Sea Coast
to serve as a forward deployment point for US troops stationed nearby.
Like Poland, it [fears Russian attempts to restore its prior control
over the region]{.underline}, such as its covert invasion of eastern
Ukraine in 2014. [[Bulgaria]{.mark} too is building up its military
forces,]{.underline} [partnering with the US to invest in
expanding]{.underline} one of its [major bases]{.underline} and
purchasing a large number of tanks and missile systems from the United
States. [[Lithuania]{.mark} has agreed to host a rotating US motorized
brigade]{.underline} and purchased new US military equipment to
train [with](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/10/14/on-the-borders-of-putins-baltic-fortress-lithuania-cheers-the-build-up-of-us-forces-in-the-baltics/).
Yet it is significant that these decisions were made between Romanian
and Bulgarian and US
defense [officials](https://balkaninsight.com/2018/08/30/us-air-force-to-spend-40-million-on-base-in-transylvania-08-27-2018/).
Just like so many other [[security decisions]{.underline}]{.mark} these
days, they [were [made outside]{.mark}, not inside, the [NATO]{.mark}
framework, further demonstrating its debilitating ability to galvanize
concerted action.]{.underline}

All of this is not to say that [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} is or is not
obsolete, merely that, [in its current structure,]{.underline} the
alliance [[is failing to provide]{.mark} on its guarantee of [security
and protection]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the current discussion over
the purpose of the alliance may have been inflamed by Washington, [the
source of NATO's problems run far deeper]{.underline} [and are routed in
its failure to adequately defend against the threat of a seemingly
resurgent Russia]{.underline}. It is therefore no wonder that many are
increasingly questioning the purpose of the alliance to their respective
nations, and it is a question that must be addressed seriously if NATO
wants to survive.

#### NATO's falling apart -- Russia, internal division, Afghanistan, and [everyone wants out]{.underline}. 

**Clark 2/4** -- Dave Clark, 2-4-2022, \"Stoltenberg To Leave NATO After
Battle To Keep US In And Russia Out,\" No Publication,

accessed 6-20-2022 -- OBERTO!

NATO\'s outgoing leader [Jens **[Stoltenberg will leave]{.mark}** the
alliance]{.underline} late this year [[after a]{.mark} diplomatic
[battle to hold it together against outside]{.mark} threats [and]{.mark}
**the [clashing]{.mark} egos** of its [national
leaders.]{.mark}]{.underline}

From December, the 62-year-old economist will again wrestle with balance
sheets in his new role as head of Norway\'s central bank, after eight
years of high international drama.

[[Stoltenberg\'s]{.mark} extended mandate
[presiding]{.mark}]{.underline} over the alliance [[has not been]{.mark}
an [easy]{.mark} period for NATO since he took over in
2014]{.underline}, and independent [observers credit the former
Norwegian prime minister with holding the alliance
together.]{.underline}

Russia\'s President Vladimir [[Putin has]{.mark} mobilised a huge force
to [try to force the alliance to drop]{.mark} its open door to [eastern
and central]{.mark} European [members]{.mark}]{.underline}, which during
the Cold War had been held in Moscow\'s orbit.

But \-- even as he kept an eye on external threats from Russia and
Afghanistan \-- [Stoltenberg has also had to **tread
carefully**]{.underline} to keep rival leaders within the Atlantic
alliance on board.

Former US president Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, who
[[resented]{.mark} what he saw as [European freeloading]{.mark} in an
alliance [dominated by]{.mark} the big-spending [American
military]{.mark}, famously **[declared NATO
\"obsolete]{.mark}**\".]{.underline}

[[Turkey]{.mark}\'s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan dismissed his
allies\' protests and [bought]{.mark} a [Russian air defence]{.mark}
system [**incompatible** with Western equipment]{.mark} \-- [while
engaged in a maritime standoff with NATO ally
Greece.]{.mark}]{.underline}

And [France\'s]{.underline} **[Emmanuel [Macron]{.mark},]{.underline}**
[frustrated by resistance]{.underline} to his push for greater European
autonomy and sovereignty, [[snapped that the alliance was
experiencing]{.mark} strategic \"[brain death]{.mark}\".]{.underline}

Before coming to Brussels, when he served as Norway\'s prime minister,
Stoltenberg was known for having good relations with Putin and Russia\'s
former prime minister Dmitry Medvedev. During his decade in power, the
two countries \-- which share a narrow Arctic border \-- signed
agreements on the their frontier in the Barents Sea and on visa
exemptions for their border populations. An economist by training, the
former Labour Party head had never shown any particular fondness for
defence or security matters \-- but his experience left him with a
strong international network. Before he joined government there was
little to suggest he would lead a military alliance. In Brussels, he is
known for his strait-laced appearance and unsmiling didactic style \--
but as a long-haired teenager in the 1970s, he threw stones at the US
embassy in Oslo in reaction to the Vietnam War. Born into a political
family \-- his father was minister of defence and then of foreign
affairs, his mother a deputy minister \-- the married father-of-two also
devoted the majority of his career to politics. After entering
parliament in 1991, he rose rapidly, becoming minister of energy and
then of finance, before being named the country\'s youngest prime
minister in 2000, the day after his 41st birthday. Stoltenberg won
international respect with his measured response to Norway\'s worst
peace-time massacre. When right-wing extremist Anders Behring Breivik
killed 77 people on July 22, 2011, he called for \"more democracy\" and
\"more humanity\". When it came time for him to seek the NATO job, he
was backed by centrist heavyweights German chancellor Angela Merkel and
then US president Barack Obama. In Brussels, cynical observers often
quip that any NATO secretary general\'s core task is to \"Keep the
Russians out and the Americans in\" \-- and for a while that was
Stoltenberg\'s main challenge.

[Trump came to the December 2019 NATO summit in Watford, England, ready
to break up the alliance]{.underline} that Washington had led since it
was formed in 1949.

[It was Stoltenberg who talked him down, experts say.]{.underline}

According to Jamie Shea, a former senior NATO official turned think tank
expert, Stoltenberg convinced Trump that his demands for Europe to
shoulder more of the financial burden were paying off.

\"[He kept Trump in NATO, which was far from certain]{.underline}. He
was one of the few European leaders that Trump was positive about,\"
Shea told AFP, crediting the Norwegian with moving on from an
\"existential situation\".

Stoltenberg also deftly managed the prickly Erdogan, having decided \--
in Shea\'s words \-- it was better to \"keep the family together even if
it meant having to deal with an authoritarian\".

[[Trump\'s departure lifted one threat]{.mark}, but [NATO\'s next
challenge]{.mark} again [**showed the strains** in]{.mark} the
trans-Atlantic [relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Amid]{.underline} the debacle of the [rushed departure of the remaining
US and NATO troops]{.underline} from a collapsing Afghanistan last year,
European capitals and Stoltenberg\'s NATO headquarters found themselves
left in the dark by American decision-making.

\"[It is the [Afghan affair]{.mark} that dominates the mandate and it
cannot be said to be a success]{.underline},\" Elie Tenenbaum, an
analyst at the French Institute of International Relations.

But [this year\'s crisis]{.underline}, with Putin deploying more than
100,000 troops to Russia\'s [[Ukraine border]{.mark}, to occupied
[Crimea]{.mark} and to [Belarus]{.mark} to intimidate Kiev has again
given NATO a central role in events.]{.underline}

[[Moscow]{.mark} clearly **[wanted to split the allies,]{.mark}**
disregarding European nations and the European Union to demand direct
talks with Washington]{.underline}. But Stoltenberg\'s NATO ended up
marshalling a tough diplomatic response.

NATO members united behind a stern reply to Putin\'s demands, dismissing
calls to block future membership bids.

#### NATO is dissolving now -- Anti-NATO conservative ideologies are spreading domestically AND abroad. 

**Saletan 4/12** -- William Saletan American writer for The Bulwark,
B.A. with highest honors in philosophy from Swarthmore, 4-12-2022,
\"Putin Wants to Break NATO. Republicans Want to Help Him.,\" Bulwark,
https://www.thebulwark.com/putin-wants-to-break-nato-republicans-want-to-help-him/,
accessed 6-20-2022 -- OBERTO!

[Vladimir [Putin's]{.mark} central [objective in Europe is]{.mark}n't to
capture]{.underline} Kyiv, the Donbas, or any other part of [Ukraine.
It's **[to weaken]{.mark}** the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
\[**[NATO]{.mark}**\], which protects most of the continent against
him]{.underline}. And in that longstanding campaign, [[Putin **scored**
two]{.mark} significant **[victories]{.mark}** this week.]{.underline}

[One was [in France]{.mark}, where Marine [Le Pen]{.mark}, a [Putin
sympathizer](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/world/europe/marine-le-pen-of-france-meets-with-putin-in-moscow.html),
[finished a close second]{.mark} to Emmanuel Macron]{.underline} in
Sunday's French presidential election. [Le Pen is [running [almost
even](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/macron-faces-tough-fight-france-votes-sunday-2022-04-10/) with
Macron]{.mark} in polls for the April 24 runoff. She has said that if
she wins, **[she'll [withdraw
France](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20220304-ukraine-war-puts-france-s-nato-sceptic-presidential-candidates-in-a-tight-spot) from
NATO]{.mark}'s** command structure.]{.underline}

[The other victory was [in the United States]{.mark}, where [63 House
Republicans]{.mark}, nearly a third of the GOP conference,
**[voted [against a resolution of
support](https://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll115.xml) for
NATO.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[The House vote]{.underline}]{.mark}, taken on April 5, [[is a warning
sign]{.mark}. Putin]{.underline} may be losing ground in Ukraine, [but
he's gaining ground in the U.S. Congress. [Three years ago, [22 House
Republicans](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/201944) voted against]{.mark}
pro-NATO legislation. [That number]{.mark} has nearly
**[tripled]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[The "[Putin wing]{.mark}" of the House GOP]{.underline}---useful idiots
such as Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene, who [openly
spout](https://www.wral.com/us-rep-madison-cawthorn-calls-zelensky-thug/20180199/) Russian [propaganda](https://twitter.com/RepMTG/status/1512126723164409867)---[is
only a tiny [fraction of]{.mark} the Kremlin's [target audience]{.mark}
in Congress. They're joined by a larger crowd of [Ukraine
bashers,]{.mark} hardcore [isolationists]{.mark}, and
[right-wingers]{.mark} who say we shouldn't worry about anyone else's
borders until we "secure" our own. Together, that [coalition
adds]{.mark} up to [more than [20]{.mark}
lawmakers](https://www.thebulwark.com/whos-soft-on-russia-meet-the-republican-anti-ukraine-caucus/)]{.underline}.

That's a problem. But [when you [combine]{.mark} them [with]{.mark} the
[NATO skeptics]{.mark} who voted against last week's
resolution---another 40 or so House Republicans who don't trust
alliances and who view Europeans as America's rivals or
adversaries---[the problem gets a lot bigger.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The GOP's turn against NATO is particularly worrisome because Congress
has been warned]{.underline}, explicitly and repeatedly, [about Putin's
goal of dissolving the alliance]{.underline}. In March 2017, after a
U.S. intelligence
report [confirmed](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf) that
[Russia had interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential
election]{.underline}, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs---which
was then, like the rest of Congress, under Republican control---held a
hearing on this subject. The hearing was titled, "[Undermining
Democratic Institutions and Splintering NATO: Russian Disinformation
Aims](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/FA/FA00/20170309/105674/HHRG-115-FA00-Transcript-20170309.pdf)."
Analysts and former officials explained to the committee how [Russia
had]{.underline}, in the words of one witness, [persistently funded
propaganda in the West to "fracture allied security, stoke public
distrust against democratic institutions, and discredit the alliance
structures that defend Europe."]{.underline}

Over the next two years, [other reports documented the same
problem]{.underline}. The [European Council on Foreign Relations noted
Russia's efforts to undermine support for NATO in [Finland, the Czech
Republic, and other
countries](https://ecfr.eu/publication/controlling_chaos_how_russia_manages_its_political_war_in_europe/).
Foreign policy journals and articles in the American press noted [rising
alarm](https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/93/2/251/2996077) in]{.underline}
Europe at President Donald [Trump's threats to withdraw]{.underline}
U.S. troops from the continent [or to abandon the American commitment to
defend NATO allies.]{.underline}

On [January 14, 2019,]{.underline} the New York Times reported that
"[several times" in 2018, [Trump]{.mark} had "[[privately said he wanted
to
withdraw]{.mark}](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html)]{.underline}"
from the alliance. The article said [Trump had "told his top national
security officials that he did not see the point of the military
alliance, which he presented as a drain on the United
States."]{.underline}

A few days after the Times report, [House Democrats filed and brought to
the floor the [[NATO Support
Act]{.mark}](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/676),]{.underline}
which [reaffirmed](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/676/text) that
the U.S. was "solemnly committed to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's principle of collective defense as enumerated in Article
5." [The bill]{.underline} couldn't completely bind Trump, but it
[[expressed]{.mark} the sense of Congress that "the [President shall not
withdraw]{.mark} the United States from NATO"]{.underline} and that
American policy was "to reject any efforts to withdraw the United States
from NATO." It also prohibited the use of federal funds "to take any
action to withdraw the United States" from the alliance.

Every Democrat voted for the bill; [[22 Republicans [voted against
it](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/201944)]{.mark}.]{.underline}

One of the 22 Republicans, Rep. Scott Perry, explained why he and other
self-styled hawks had voted no. In a [statement to
constituents](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2184564228306520&id=376801102416184),
he complained that "the bill prevented the U.S. from ever leaving NATO .
. . unless Congress first voted to repeal this would-be new law." Perry
wanted Trump to be free to pull America out of NATO, on his own.

Perry also argued that Trump should be free "to negotiate better terms
for the United States in NATO," as though the alliance were a trade
deal. And he warned that "an ally of ours today may not be an ally
tomorrow."

That's how Perry
and [many](https://twitter.com/chiproytx/status/1088080295608365057) of
his [colleagues](https://www.nwfdailynews.com/story/special/special-sections/2019/01/23/gaetz-explains-vote-on-nato-resolution/6218256007/) viewed
the world. They saw alliances as entanglements and burdens. They worried
that even friendly countries couldn't be trusted. They believed that
America should hedge its commitments because our allies might screw us.

And that was all [Putin needed]{.underline}. He didn't need [American
lawmakers]{.underline} to love him the way Trump did. He just needed
them [to constrain or withhold support from NATO.]{.underline}

Perry's defection was a particularly good sign for Putin. The
congressman wasn't just an Iraq war veteran. He had also chaired part of
the 2017 hearing on Russia's strategy to undermine NATO. So he must have
known he was doing what Putin wanted.

But he did it anyway, because he thought he was protecting America from
Europe.

In the three years since that vote, [Congress has seen even more
evidence of Russia's operations to sabotage NATO]{.underline}.

In April 2019, the Justice Department released the [[Mueller
report]{.underline}](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download).
It [detailed how Russia had lobbied Trump campaign officials against
NATO]{.underline}; how the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} campaign,
according to one of its own former co-chairs, had [[shifted away from
"the NATO framework"]{.underline};]{.mark} and how the Trump team had
[blocked Republican platform language that would have endorsed
"providing lethal defensive weapons" to Ukraine.]{.underline}

In October 2019, the [Senate Intelligence Committee released an analysis
of [Russian propaganda
techniques](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf)]{.underline}.
The report showed [how the Kremlin had sought to "drive wedges in the
Western community alliances of all sorts, particularly
NATO.]{.underline}" One of [Russia's]{.underline} tricks, the report
noted, was "[discouraging United States support]{.underline}" for
[accepting eastern European countries]{.underline} [into NATO by
portraying those countries as "free riders."]{.underline}

In August 2020, the Senate committee issued a report that showed how
Kremlin sympathizers had [lobbied the Trump campaign against
NATO](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/report_volume5.pdf).
The report found that in April 2016, then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie
had advised Trump to affirm in a speech that "our commitment to our NATO
allies in Eastern Europe is absolute" and that "we need to stand up to
Russian aggression together." The Trump campaign had rejected this
language.

In September 2020, New York Times journalist Michael Schmidt reported
that during Trump's presidency, his then-chief of staff, John Kelly,
had [struggled to stop Trump from pulling
out](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/trump-nato-withdraw.html) of
NATO. In July 2021, Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip
Rucker revealed that Trump had told advisers he would [abandon the
alliance in his second
term](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/13/book-excerpt-i-alone-can-fix-it/).
And last month, Trump's former national security adviser, John
Bolton, told the Post that "[Putin was
waiting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/04/bolton-says-trump-might-have-pulled-us-out-nato-if-he-had-been-reelected/)"
for Trump to do just that.

[[After]{.mark} all these warnings, and after Putin's latest invasion of
[Ukraine, one might]{.mark} have [expect]{.mark}ed the congressional
caucus of [NATO critics to shrink.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Instead, it multiplied.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Why did so many Republicans vote against the latest pro-NATO resolution?

Some openly reject the alliance. "[[NATO is [a relic of the Cold
War]{.mark}](https://twitter.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1511515988843499523),"
said Rep. Thomas Massie. "Why should Americans pay for Europe's
defense?"]{.underline}

Others said [the U.S. should be [wary of overcommitment]{.mark}. "[We
shouldn't say that our support for NATO is
unconditional](https://americasvoice.news/video/cQko2gFlWCIB3aZ/)]{.underline},"
said Rep. Warren Davidson.

But others, including Perry, complained that [the resolution [threatened
American sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a video statement, Perry
told his constituents that [the resolution "politicizes
NATO"]{.underline} by saying "[if you're not supporting socialism, then
we're going to use NATO against
you](https://www.facebook.com/repscottperry/videos/429791295614916)."

This is a bizarre misrepresentation. The
resolution [affirmed](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/831/text) that
NATO was "founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty,
and the rule of law." Those words are literally in [the alliance's
founding
treaty](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm).
The resolution also called for "unwavering support to the people of
Ukraine." And it endorsed a project, [jointly
proposed](https://turner.house.gov/press-releases?ID=04A29990-6F5C-4465-BE92-6C6C7CF0E8C6) by [Democratic
and Republican
lawmakers](https://connolly.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=4509),
to build "NATO's capacity to strengthen democratic institutions within
NATO member, partner, and aspirant countries."

To make sure nobody misconstrued that language as an attack on
sovereignty, the resolution stipulated that any NATO monitoring of
"challenges to democracy" within member states would be undertaken only
"when requested."

Perry ignored that stipulation and caricatured the resolution. So did
several of his colleagues. Representative Chip Roy described [the
resolution as "[empowering international organizations to target the
internal activities of sovereign
nations](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/04/06/congress-nato-support-texas-representatives/)."]{.underline}
Davidson described it as "[[using NATO to try to undermine America's
sovereignty](https://americasvoice.news/video/cQko2gFlWCIB3aZ/).]{.underline}"

Some members who opposed the measure also expressed hostility toward
Europe. [Davidson said "[global commitments]{.mark}" to accords on
climate, banking, and other issues were [forcing the U.S. to
adopt]{.mark} the "[inferior]{.mark} system" of "the
[Europeans]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Roy fretted that NATO, empowered by the House resolution, would subject
Americans to "[the leftist orthodoxy that now unfortunately permeates
most of Western
Europe](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/04/06/congress-nato-support-texas-representatives/)."

These lawmakers think they're patriots. They think that by voting to
limit NATO and America's commitment to it, they're protecting us. And
that's what makes their subversion of the alliance, from Putin's point
of view, so delicious.

It's so much easier to serve evil when you think you're doing good.

#### Turkey is throwing a wrench in NATO -- They won't leave BUT they won't stop being a problem. 

**The Economist 6/19** -- Economist, 06-19-2022, \"Is Turkey more
trouble to NATO than it is worth?,\"

[The received wisdom is that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has breathed
new life]{.underline}, and a new sense of [purpose, urgency and unity
into NATO. **Someone forgot to tell Recep Tayyip
[Erdogan]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Over the past month [the Turkish
president has [blocked **NATO enlargement**, warned of a new offensive
against]{.mark} American-backed [Kurdish fighters]{.mark} in Syria and
[stoked tensions with Greece]{.mark}, also a member of the
alliance]{.underline}. A few pundits, in the West but also in Turkey,
are once again debating whether NATO and Turkey should part ways. This
time, they are not alone. "[Leaving NATO should be put on the agenda as
an alternative]{.underline}," Devlet Bahceli, leader of a nationalist
party in Mr. Erdogan's coalition, recently said. "[We did not exist
because of NATO and we will not perish without NATO."]{.underline}

[[Frustration]{.mark} is also [mounting in **West**]{.mark}**ern
capitals**]{.underline}, and in Kyiv, [[over]{.mark} Turkey's
willingness to accommodate [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many in those
places had hoped that the war in Ukraine would force Mr. Erdogan to
reconsider his romance with Vladimir Putin, Russia's president.
[[Opportunism]{.mark} has [prevailed]{.mark} instead.
[Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline} has sold armed drones to Ukraine and closed
access to the Black Sea for Russian warships, but it [[opposes]{.mark}
Western **[sanctions]{.mark}** against Russia and openly courts Russian
capital.]{.underline} According to a report in the Turkish media, dozens
of [[Russian companies]{.underline}]{.mark}, including Gazprom, [are
planning to [move]{.mark} their European headquarters [to
Turkey]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Aside from a few words of condemnation at the start of the war in
Ukraine, Turkey [has remained on good terms with Russia
throughout.]{.underline} When Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov,
visited Ankara this month his Turkish counterpart kindly suggested that
the West should ease sanctions against Russia if Russia relaxed its
blockade of Ukrainian ports. When Mr Lavrov repeated his claim that
Russia had invaded Ukraine to liberate it from neo-Nazis, his host said
nothing.

Mr. [[Erdogan's]{.mark} move to [block Sweden]{.mark}'s [and
Finland]{.mark}'s accession to NATO has further damaged Turkey's
standing in the alliance]{.underline}. The strongman has signaled that
[he wants the Nordic countries to extradite several members of the
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK),]{.underline} an outlawed armed group,
and to [drop a partial arms embargo against his country]{.underline}. He
may also be shopping for concessions from America in exchange for
withdrawing his veto, or from Russia for doing the opposite. Mr. as
[Erdogan occasionally sounds hostile to NATO enlargement]{.underline} a
matter of principle. In a recent guest column for The Economist, he went
as far as to blame Finland and Sweden for adding an "unnecessary item"
to NATO's agenda by asking to join the alliance.

Mr. Erdogan may have reasoned that a couple of foreign crises were
needed to distract Turkish voters from their fast-diminishing
circumstances, as galloping inflation, officially measured at over 70%,
devours their savings and wages. In late May he warned of a new military
offensive against Kurdish forces in Syria. Forced to shelve such plans,
presumably because of opposition from Russia or America or both, he has
since lashed out against Greece, demanding that it demilitarize Greek
islands hugging Turkey's western coast. He has also suggested that
American bases in Greece pose a threat to Turkey (which hosts American
forces itself). This might be bluster, and blow over. But obstructing
Finland's and Sweden's NATO membership while war rages in Europe is
bound to have consequences, even if Mr. Erdogan backs down. Sweden had
been one of the few countries keeping alive Turkey's hopes of membership
in the European Union. That support has now gone.

That may seem a price worth paying to Mr. Erdogan if the row fires up
his nationalist base. [Mainstream [Turkish
politicians]{.mark},]{.underline} as well as many humbler Turks, [see
the PKK purely as a security threat]{.underline}, and have long
criticized the West for not taking their concerns about the group
seriously. They have [[bristled]{.mark} especially [at America]{.mark}'s
decision to [team]{.mark} up [with]{.mark} the group's [Syrian
wing]{.mark} to bring down Islamic State's caliphate]{.underline}.
Westerners, meanwhile, tend to believe that Turkey bears much of the
blame for the PKK's emergence by refusing to grant the country's Kurds
the rights they demand. They have also concluded that Mr. [Erdogan
cannot be trusted to decide who is or is not a terrorist]{.underline}.
By applying the label to thousands of people, including bureaucrats,
academics, peaceful protesters and Kurdish politicians, and often
throwing them into the same prisons as armed militants, Mr. Erdogan has
cheapened the term as badly as he has Turkey's currency.

[Turkey and the West will never see eye to eye on the
issue]{.underline}, and Mr. Erdogan's antics, as well as his habit of
suggesting that the West, and not Russia, is the biggest threat to his
country, will only make matters worse. [Already, 65% of Turks say they
do not trust NATO,]{.underline} according to a recent survey, although
60% support membership of the alliance.

None of this spells doom for the relationship between Turkey and NATO.
**[[Western countries will]{.mark} try to [work]{.mark} round Turkey's
veto by providing Finland and Sweden with security
guarantees.]{.underline}** This may leave Turkey sidelined within the
alliance. But its departure or eviction from NATO is still fantasy.
Turkey is on the front line of the war in Syria and close to other
conflicts in the Middle East; it controls access to the Black Sea, which
has been central to all of Russia's recent wars; and it serves as a
corridor for trade between Central Asia and Europe, especially in
energy, notes Ben Hodges, a former commander of American forces in
Europe. "I don't even want to think of NATO without Turkey," he says.

Especially in the wake of Russia's war in Ukraine, [[Turkey]{.mark} also
[has no interest in surrendering]{.mark} the power of deterrence
that NATO membership offers.]{.underline} "I don't believe it will ever
happen," says Tacan Ildem, Turkey's former permanent representative
to NATO. There is no credible alternative, he says. [Turkey will
probably remain a headache for the alliance]{.underline}, even when Mr.
Erdogan is out of the picture. But it is a headache NATO will have to
live with.

## Russia War

### Russia War\-\--1NC

#### Effective NATO operations ensure US-Russia war

US Foreign Policy: Ukrainians Are Latest Victims,"

[Russia's attack on Ukraine turns uglier by the day]{.underline}.
Moscow's forces have compounded aggression with attacks on civilians,
and apparently personal atrocities as well, conduct which will make an
eventual peace settlement, as well as reintegration of Russia into the
international system, much more difficult. [Vladimir Putin and his
ruling coterie are responsible]{.underline} for the unjustified and
illegal invasion of Ukraine. [Western policy toward Moscow since the
Soviet collapse was foolish]{.underline}, even reckless, [but that in no
way justified the Russian attack]{.underline}. The Putin regime is
responsible, and its crime will prove disastrous for the Russian as well
as Ukrainian people. [Yet blame for the tragedy now befalling
Ukraine]{.underline} --- thousands of dead, millions of refugees, major
cities bombarded, economy disrupted, society ravaged --- [is shared by
the U.S]{.underline}. [Washington again has demonstrated that its
policies matter to the world]{.underline}. Usually in a horrifically
negative way. As has been oft detailed in recent days, [the U.S. and
European states blithely ignored multiple assurances made to both the
Soviet Union and Russia that NATO would not be expanded up to their
borders]{.underline}. [The allies also demonstrated their willingness to
ignore Moscow's expressed security interests]{.underline} with the
coercive dismemberment of Serbia, "color revolutions" in Tbilisi and
Kyiv, and especially support for the 2014 street putsch against
Ukraine's elected, Russo‐​friendly president. Whether such actions
*should* have bothered Moscow isn't important. They did, and
[perceptions are what matter]{.underline}. In this case, [perception was
reality]{.underline}. Indeed, [Washington would never have accepted
equivalent behavior by Russia in the Western hemisphere]{.underline} ---
marching the Warsaw Pact or Collective Security Treaty Organization up
to America's borders, backing a coup in Mexico City or Ontario, and
inviting the new government to join the military alliance. [The response
in Washington would have been explosive hysteria followed by a tsunami
of demands and threats]{.underline}. There would have been no sweet talk
about the right of other nations to decide their own destinies. True,
this might not be the only factor influencing Putin's decision on war.
He has articulated strong, though distorted, views of Ukrainian
nationhood and Kyiv's proper relations to Russia. However, [security
concerns have always loomed largest]{.underline}. [He and other
officials criticized NATO expansion early, when the alliance began its
move eastward]{.underline}. Most famously, he raised the issue in his
talk to the 2007 Munich Security Conference. His position reflected
Russia's perspective but was serious both in substance and delivery.
[Putin said the U.S. had "overstepped its national borders in every
way]{.underline}," that its "[almost uncontained hyper use of force" was
"plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts]{.underline}."
This was after America's endless war in Afghanistan and disastrous
invasion of Iraq; Libya, Syria, and Yemen were yet to come. He also
observed that "[NATO has put its frontline forces on our borders, and
we...do not react to these actions at all]{.underline}." He continued:
"I [think it is obvious that NATO expansion does not have any relation
with the modernization of the alliance itself]{.underline} or with
ensuring security in Europe. [On the contrary, it represents a serious
provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust]{.underline}. And we
have the right to ask: against whom is this expansion intended? And what
happened to the assurances our western partners made after the
dissolution of the Warsaw Pact? Where are those declarations today? No
one even remembers them. But I will allow myself to remind this audience
what was said. I would like to quote the speech of NATO General
Secretary Mr. Woerner in Brussels on 17 May 1990. He said at the time
that: 'the fact that we are ready not to place a NATO army outside of
German territory gives the Soviet Union a firm security guarantee.'
Where are these guarantees?" [If allied behavior was not a sufficient
cause for Moscow's invasion, it certainly was a necessary
cause]{.underline}. Putin might believe Ukraine should be part of
Russia, but for the last 22 years did not attempt to conquer the
country. His more limited attacks in 2014 were triggered by the
Western‐​backed ouster of a friendly government. Whatever Putin's view of
reconstituting the Soviet Union, after two decades all he has managed to
do is retake Crimea and extend Russian influence over the Donbass,
Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. A repeat of Adolf Hitler he certainly is
not. Again, [this does not excuse Moscow's latest conduct]{.underline},
which is grotesque, criminal, and immoral. [However, it offers a
terrible reminder that U.S. intervention has consequences]{.underline}.
Consider Iran. Tehran is a repressive dictatorship and plays a malign
role in the region. Fear of Iran now consumes much of the U.S. foreign
policy community, which seems to imagine Tehran as an intimidating
superpower and America as a threatened middling power. Response to Iran
now dramatically distorts Washington's Mideast policy. Most tragically,
Washington has made Tehran the excuse for backing the mass murder of
Yemeni civilians by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. However,
Iran did not come by its malicious role naturally. Washington famously
promoted the 1953 coup that ousted the elected government of Mohammad
Mosaddegh and for a quarter century supported Iran's shah, who created a
brutal police state which was justifiably overthrown by his own people.
Tragically, the new regime proved equally tyrannical, while also
determined to spread Islamic revolution. The war in Yemen has consumed
almost 400,000 civilian lives. Internal strife always has been common in
that relatively new nation, but Saudi and Emirati intervention in what
was just another internal fight expanded and intensified the conflict.
Although they could continue the war without U.S. consent, they could
not do so effectively without U.S. support. American companies not only
provided the planes but service them today. The U.S. also provides
munitions and intelligence, and in the war's early days refueled Saudi
and Emirati planes as well. This backing has been vital for the
operation of the royal air forces and has contributed to many thousand
Yemeni deaths. Nor is America a favored target of terrorism because of
random selection or its virtuous reputation. Washington has routinely
interfered in the affairs of other nations --- backing dictatorships,
supporting oppressive occupations, meddling in elections, and
intervening militarily. A vivid example was Lebanon in 1983, in which
the U.S. joined the latter's bitter civil war. An American highlight
over the last two decades has been droning, bombing, invading, and
occupying other lands. Michael Scheuer, onetime CIA counter‐​terrorism
analyst, cited aid to authoritarian Arab governments, support for
Israeli occupation over Palestinians, Washington's long economic and
military campaign against Iraq, and U.S. military units based in Saudi
Arabia as grievances. Osama bin Laden said after 9/11: "it entered my
mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind --- and that we should
destroy the towers in America in order that they taste some of what we
tasted, and so that they be deterred from killing our women and
children." The would‐​be Times Square bomber, Faisal Shahzad, thought
similarly. His sentencing judge asked Shahzad about his reasoning,
reported ABC News: "Shahzad said the judge needed to understand his
role. 'I consider myself to be a Muslim soldier,' he said. When \[Judge
Miriam\] Cedarbaum asked whether he considered the people in Times
Square to be innocent, he said they had elected the U.S. government.
'Even children?' said Cedarbaum. 'When the drones \[in Pakistan\] hit,
they don't see children,' answered Shahzad. He then said, 'I am part of
the answer to the US killing the Muslim people'." Bad, even criminally
aggressive, U.S. policies don't justify attacks on civilians, but they
help explain terrorism. For peoples and states without missiles, air
wings, and carrier groups, terrorism is the most effective and perhaps
only method of responding. That is, terrorism is war by other means,
which is why it also has been waged in Sri Lanka (by separatist Tamils
against the Sinhalese‐​dominated government), Israel (over its
maltreatment of Palestinians), Spain (by Basque separatists), and many
other nations, including the old empires of Russia and Austro‐​Hungary.
In the latter an assassination by a Serbian terrorist triggered World
War I. Perhaps the most pernicious U.S. intervention was entering that
conflict. Washington had no stake in the imperial slugfest and Woodrow
Wilson's formal justification for intervening, to defend the right of
Americans to book passage on a belligerent power's reserve cruisers
carrying munitions through a war zone, was eloquent nonsense. Alas,
America's entry allowed the imposition of the infamous Versailles Treaty
Diktat, which became one of the grievances that aided Adolf Hitler's
rise to power. Whatever the details of the compromise peace that
otherwise likely would have resulted, it could hardly have yielded a
worse result than World War II. [Now the Russo‐​Ukraine war adds another
example to Uncle Sam's history of foreign policy
malpractice]{.underline}. The conflict is not strictly America's fault,
since Moscow made an independent decision to attack its neighbor. For
that, the Putin government bears responsibility. However, [the U.S. and
its European allies set the stage for the war]{.underline}, [engaging in
behavior that clearly yet needlessly antagonized Russia]{.underline}.
For contributing to the horror now engulfing Ukraine, [Washington should
be held responsible and its officials held accountable]{.underline}.
[Otherwise more people will keep dying because of Uncle Sam's foolish
hubris]{.underline}.

#### Commitment trap\-\--no amount of reassurance can surmount interest asymmetries\-\--try-or-die for minimizing NATO's footprint 

**Shifrinson**, Joshua, Prof of IR @ BU, **17**, "Time to Consolidate
NATO?" *The Washington Quarterly,* Vol. 40, Issue 1.

The [credibility]{.underline} of the U.S. commitment to its NATO allies
[has long been unclear.]{.underline} At root, **[[credibility]{.mark}
[hinges on the perception]{.mark} in the minds [of foreign
decisionmakers that a state has sufficient
interest]{.mark}]{.underline}** in a given issue that it is willing to
pay a certain---potentially large---cost to obtain or secure that
objective. Owing to the exorbitant prospective costs of a U.S.--Soviet
nuclear exchange during the Cold War, regular transatlantic crises
revolved around the question of whether the United States would trade
"Boston for Bonn" in the event of a general European war.8 So long as
the United States retained sole control of NATO's decision to escalate
past the nuclear threshold, U.S. policymakers faced a real problem in
making Soviet policymakers and American allies alike believe that they
would willingly take the nuclear plunge if events dictated.9 As Thomas
Schelling noted long ago, [[it is inherently difficult to
convince]{.mark} other [actors]{.mark} that [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [will commit suicide]{.mark} [for other
states]{.mark}]{.underline}.10 Still, [this problem was at least
plausibly manageable]{.underline} [[during the Cold
War]{.underline}]{.mark}.11 Despite the prospective costs, [[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [retained a large and pervasive interest
in]{.mark} keeping [Western Europe]{.mark}'s economic and military
potential]{.underline} [beyond Soviet control]{.underline}. These
objectives, in fact, heavily shaped the United States' Cold War
commitment to European security as the United States moved (1) to defend
Western Europe from potential Soviet machinations, and (2) to deter
Soviet adventurism against the area in the first place.12 [The
alternative was clear: if the Soviet Union were to dominate Europe's
war-making strength, it might tip the balance of power]{.underline}
against the United States, requiring a potentially ruinous
counter-mobilization and global competition that an isolated United
States might be unable to win. Geography reinforced this imperative, as
failure to deter or defend against a Soviet assault across the
inner-German border meant the USSR could quickly overrun the region.
[The result was a concerted effort by the United States to make its
promise to defend its NATO allies as credible]{.underline} as possible
by forward-deploying large military force and seeking ways to escalate a
contest with the USSR should it prove necessary.13 [[Today, the
situation is reversed]{.underline}.]{.mark} The grand bargain in which
Washington kept its finger alone on the nuclear button remains intact;
[if the United States is to fully honor its treaty commitments, it must
ultimately be willing to engage in a nuclear exchange with Russia for
the sake of its allies.]{.underline} However, [[where the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [could plausibly claim to trade Boston for Bonn]{.mark}
prior to 1991, **[no amount of reassurance can make the promise to trade
Toledo for Tallinn credible]{.mark}**]{.underline} today---[the stakes
of the game are too low.]{.underline} Alliances function when states
decide that their mutual preservation adds to each side's national
security and can be attained at a cost proportional to the benefit. For
better or worse, NATO's post-Cold War enlargement altered this equation
by notionally committing the United States to defend a host of states in
Eastern Europe of questionable relevance to U.S. security. Indeed, those
[states most immediately threatened by Russia]{.underline}---[[Estonia,
Latvia, and Lithuania]{.mark},]{.underline} followed by
Poland---[[are]{.mark} among the **[least important
allies]{.mark}**]{.underline} in crude geopolitical terms. [The [three
Baltic states]{.mark} combined [accounted for]{.mark} only [0.13 percent
of]{.mark} total NATO [defense expenditures]{.mark}]{.underline} and
0.26 percent of NATO members' GDP as of 2016; Poland represented 1.17
and 1.54 percent, respectively.14 American exchange with these states is
similarly limited: trade with the Baltic states as a whole came to less
than \$3 billion in 2015 against over \$3.75 trillion in total U.S.
trade.15 Baldly stated, [these [states could disappear without
compromising]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' [economic
security or]{.mark} NATO's [military viability]{.mark}. The
[questionable value]{.mark} of these states]{.underline} alone thus
[[renders the U.S. commitment]{.mark} to their defense **[highly
contestable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.16 The American public, meanwhile,
seems to recognize this very dynamic at some basic level, with 37
percent of U.S. citizens in a 2015 Pew Global Attitudes survey
expressing reluctance with aiding a NATO ally threatened by Russia.17
[[Political geography]{.underline}]{.mark} further [[compounds NATO's
problems. Not only can countries]{.mark} threatened by Russia [be lost
without compromising NATO's ability to defend the rest]{.mark} of
Europe[, but even an]{.mark} [expanded Russia would be poorly placed to
dominate]{.mark} the continent]{.underline}. Belarus and Ukraine, after
all, lie across any Russian advance into Central Europe, while [simply
retaining control of a unified Germany affords NATO a
defense-in-depth]{.underline} it never enjoyed during the Cold War. Add
in the reality that [Russia is an economic, political, and military
pygmy]{.underline} compared to the Soviet Union everywhere except in the
nuclear realm, and the United States' intrinsic interest in those states
most immediately threatened by Russia is substantially less than during
the Cold War.18 Simply put, unlike the situation vis-à-vis the Soviet
Union, [Russian dominance over the Baltic state]{.underline}s, Poland,
and other new(er) NATO members [would not result in the United States'
eviction from Europe]{.underline} and concomitant loss of the region's
economic or military strength. Military pressures reinforce these
dilemmas. Whereas a conventional defense of Western Europe was at least
a possibility prior to 1989--1991, distance, reinforcement rates, and
force-to-space ratios mean a [conventional defense in Eastern Europe is
**not a realistic option**]{.underline} today.19 [War games by the Rand
Corporation highlight the problem in the Baltics context]{.underline}.
To be sure, forces stationed in Eastern Europe can serve as a tripwire
to deter Russian aggression by seemingly promising to bring NATO
members' collective strength to bear.20 [If deterrence]{.underline}
fails, however, and [short of committing nearly all of NATO's
conventional ground and air power to the theater, even heavily-armored
NATO forces can **only slow down a Russian assault**]{.underline} and
promise a lengthy East--West conflict. Yet here, NATO again faces real
limits to fighting in and around NATO's East European members.21 [Though
the United States can threaten conventional escalation, it **cannot
credibly commit** to fighting for states of low strategic value if doing
so risks a strategic nuclear exchange.]{.underline} Nevertheless, the
United States would undoubtedly face calls for precisely such steps that
might lead to nuclear escalation in any losing conventional fight.
Moreover, since any sustained effort to defend or retake the Baltics
requires NATO conventional operations close to the Russian homeland, it
risks attacks (accidental or otherwise) on Russian territory that invite
an escalatory response. Russian antiaccess and area-denial (A2/AD)
assets used against reinforcements flowing into the region---to say
nothing of direct attacks on Poland---may also result in strikes on
Russian-owned Kaliningrad, generating a similar escalation problem. In
short, [[NATO]{.mark} cannot readily defend its Eastern flank through
conventional means, faces implausibly large strategic risks if it tries,
and so [confronts an **insoluble credibility
crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}.22 Indeed, [that Estonia is now preparing
to wage a lengthy guerilla war]{.underline} against a prospective
Russian occupying force, [while Lithuania is slowly moving to reinstate
a military draft suggests **vulnerable states recognize the United
States' credibility dilemma**]{.underline} [and are **hedging their
security bets** as best they can]{.underline}.23 If anything, the main
function of NATO deployments has been to antagonize a Russia that has
far more at stake in Eastern Europe for geographic and historical
reasons than the United States.24 To be clear, NATO expansion in and of
itself did not cause East--West relations to deteriorate.25 However,
U.S.-backed efforts to expand NATO eastward and subsequently deploy
military forces to the region have been met with Russian
pushback---Russian overflights of NATO airspace, diplomatic obfuscation,
and military deployments have all accelerated in recent years.26
Assuming NATO efforts in Eastern Europe continue, Russian leaders are
prone to respond with further bellicosity that generates further strains
in NATO--Russian relations.27 Paradoxically, the resulting insecurity
spiral increases the likelihood that efforts to deter Russia will result
in deterrence failure.28 Combined with the possibility that a
NATO--Russia crisis may see Russia escalate the confrontation in order
to de-escalate the situation, the risk of miscalculation is clear.29
Collectively, this situation simultaneously invites Russian actions
designed to discredit the United States in the eyes of its allies, gives
threatened allies incentives to force events with Russia to tie American
hands and deepen the United States' involvement, and increases the risk
of an action-reaction cycle.30 [The net result is a dangerous
standoff.]{.underline} To deter aggression, NATO relies on a collective
security promise ultimately capped by the pledge that the United States
will risk its own survival by putting its nuclear forces to use on
behalf of its allies. [[For]{.mark} the Baltic states, Poland,
and]{.underline}--- potentially in the future---NATO's other [[**post
Cold War additions**, this pledge is **no longer realistic**]{.mark} on
strategic or military grounds. [The steps the United States and its
allies are taking to reassure the most vulnerable members]{.mark} of
NATO,]{.underline} however, [[increase the odds of a NATO-- Russia
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet [if]{.underline} and when a [crisis
erupts]{.underline}, the clarifying effect of a prospective nuclear
exchange is apt to cause **[cooler heads]{.underline}** to [**prevail**
and]{.underline} encourage U.S. efforts [to restrain the dogs of
war]{.underline}---[revealing]{.underline} that American [security
guarantees]{.underline} to Eastern Europe **[were not credible in the
first place]{.underline}**. [The more the United States continues
pretending that its commitment to all NATO members is
created]{.underline} [equal, the more it risks creating a situation that
will reveal the shibboleth of the U.S. commitment.]{.underline}

Increased Incidence of War Involving U.S. and Russian Proxies The
[[potential for conflict between]{.mark} the United States and [Russia
is growing]{.mark} largely [due to]{.mark} the [increased prevalence of
limited war]{.mark}]{.underline} involving proxies of the nuclear
superpowers. Russia has risked limited war against Georgia and Ukraine,
countries aligned to varying degrees with the United States and NATO.
The United States and Russia have also engagedin a limited but
increasingly bloody war in Syria, on whose oil Russia maintains a
military base.9 [Given the [potential for accidents and
miscalculation]{.mark} and the [lack of a functioning forum for
discussion and resolution]{.mark} of disputes, there are real, if
limited, risks that conflict between proxies or allies of the United
States and Russia might escalate to regional or general
conflicts]{.underline} between the United States and Russia, which could
eventually escalate to nuclear war. Local conflicts, of course, need not
escalate to general or nuclear war. Indeed, [according to the
**stability-instability** paradox, limited war]{.underline} involving
allies or proxies of the nuclear superpowers on opposing sides may be
[facilitated by relatively high confidence that such wars will not
escalate]{.underline} to nuclear wars.10 The occurrence of local wars,
without escalation to direct confrontation between the superpowers,might
thus mistakenly be viewed as evidence that there is little risk of
nuclear escalation and,hence,that strategic stability is high. [However,
the prevalence of local war is evidence only that strategic stability is
judged to be high by those who engage in such wars. This does not mean
that strategic stability is in fact high]{.underline}, because the
judgments ofthose who engage in such wars may be wrong. The prevalence
of local war involving nuclear powers is thus at best an ancillary
indicator of overall strategic stability. [[Increased Risks of
Escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} Even acknowledging the increased
prevalence of conflict, the argument could be made that strategic
stability is unchanged [[because]{.underline}]{.mark} most of the
current points of [[tension]{.mark} between the United States and Russia
are [in the]{.mark} unconventional and [conventional
arenas]{.mark}]{.underline}. This would be amistake, however, because
the [escalatory potential of contemporary conflict has [increased due to
developments in doctrine and technology]{.mark}]{.underline} since the
1990s. For one, [increased [ambiguity]{.mark} in Russian nuclear
doctrine has [generated escalatory pressures on the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}---contrary to the stated intention of that
doctrine. Inaddition, the growing importance of [[space and]{.mark},
especially,[cyber warfare generates additional]{.mark} escalatory
[pressures]{.mark} for several reasons.]{.underline} Finally,[the
[erosion of knowledge]{.mark} about strategic nuclear weapons may also
[add to]{.mark} escalatory [potential]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ambiguity in
Russian Nuclear Doctrine [[Russian leaders]{.mark} have [made]{.mark} it
[clear]{.mark} that [they view their nuclear
arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}as a guarantee of their security
and [continue to **view it [as an equalizer that compensates for U.S.
conventional overmatch]{.mark}**. Russia reserves the right to use
nuclear weapons in response to nuclear attacks against Russia or "when
the state's very existence has been threatened," regardless of
whetherthe threat is nuclear]{.underline}.It is worth quoting Russian
doctrine more fully: The Russian Federation shall reserve for itself the
right to employ nuclear weapons in response to the use against it
and/orits allies of nuclear and other kinds of weapons of mass
destruction, as well as in the case of aggression against the Russian
Federation with use of conventional weapons when the state's very
existence has been threatened.11 More specifically, Russian doctrine
discusses the possibility of first nuclear use in response to a massed
conventional attack on Russia.12 [It is thus clear, according to
Russia's stated doctrine, that]{.underline} [[Russia]{.mark} is
[prepared to initiate]{.mark} the [use of nuclear weapons if]{.mark} its
[vital interests are threatened]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example,
nuclear use might begin with a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse
(HEMP) detonation or limited tactical nuclear use against amilitary
targetforthe purpose of signaling resolve and demonstrating stake, under
circumstances when Russian conventional forces are judged to be
overwhelmed and the existence ofthe Russian state is thus under threat.
What is less clear is what else Russia might consider to be a vital
interest important enough to justify nuclear first use (i.e., beyond the
circumstances that are clearfrom its stated doctrine). Such imminences
as a direct threat to the regime or the destruction or disabling of a
major part of Russia's military apparatus might, for example, fall in to
this category. Russia has chosen, however, to leave some ambiguity as to
the size, extent, and geographical location of the threat that it would
consider a vital interest that calls for the use of nuclear weapons.
This ambiguity has raises U.S. and European concerns that the nuclear
taboo may be weakening in Russian strategic thinking. The possibility
that Russia might detonate a nuclear weapon to underscore its commitment
and stake during an offensive conventional attack on NATO is very remote
but, for these reasons, cannot be ruled out. The most widely discussed
scenario involves a nonlethal Russian nuclear detonation at the outset
of a conventional Russian attack on the Baltic States or possibly
quickly after the Baltic States have been seized to deter a NATO
response. In this case,the nuclear detonation would aim to cow European
publics, divide NATO, and thus undermine U.S. will for a military
rejoinder.

### Russia War Internal\-\--2NC

#### Let NATO die---commitments are inevitably non-credible---nobody believes we'll trade Toledo for Tallin, which makes abandonment of eastern allies inevitable, but the only way to make that posturing credible is escalation threats that make nuclear conflict inevitable by transforming low level tensions into a full scale war with Russia---it's an insecurity paradox that causes symmetric overreactions between the US and Russia---that's Shifrinson

#### Restoring legitimacy is impossible---BUT struggling against the light causes brinksmanship or credibility collapse when Russia calls our bluff---both scenarios turn case

international system, a condition that, contrary to the expectations of
global optimists, was not resolved with the end of the Cold War. This
[**uncertainty** and [attempts]{.mark} by states [to **alleviate
threats**]{.mark}]{.underline} through various measures [[lead to the
**security dilemma**]{.underline}]{.mark}.18 Decision-makers can never
fully understand the plans and intentions of the other side (the "other
minds" problem), nor can they predict how weapons might be used against
them, since few weapons systems are purely offensive or defensive. [Each
state, in **enhancing** its **power**, **increases** the **insecurity**
of its rival]{.underline}.19 A security dilemma interpretation of
Russian-American relations is not solely an argument for a "blame-free"
analysis, and it does not enlighten every facet of the relationship, but
it does direct our attention toward distinct perceptual variables that
shape policy. As Robert Jervis observed, [[**psychological factors**
play a major role]{.mark} in the security dilemma, [with
**perceptions**]{.mark} and **misperceptions** [contributing to]{.mark}
a **[spiral of]{.mark} mutual [hostility]{.mark}** []{.mark}potentially
[leading to **war**]{.mark}]{.underline}.20 [States may develop
**hostile images of each other**, which]{.underline} was clearly evident
throughout the Cold War and [has been the case over the past decade or
more of **Russian-American relations**]{.underline}.21 [Under these
conditions, a **power imbalance** on one side **fuels insecurity** on
the other. [Arms buildups]{.mark} and modernization programs are
**[interpreted as aggressive]{.mark}** rather than defensive behavior,
while similar behavior on the part of the self is **held to be
benign**]{.underline}.22

[The complexity of [Russian-American ties leads both sides to **misread
each other's intentions** and **overreact**]{.mark} to potential
threats. Relations have been described as a "**wicked
problem**]{.underline}" --- that is, [an extremely complex situation
comparable to the period before World War I that could **easily spiral
into conflict**]{.underline}.23 Russian and American leaders, and
publics, have powerful perceptions and beliefs that are fundamentally
different. Russian political elites believe that "the purpose of U.S.
policy is to cause damage to Russia," and that Washington pursues this
policy through NATO expansion, promoting color revolutions, conducting
information campaigns, deploying troops in Eastern Europe, and imposing
economic sanctions.24 As Andrej Krickovic has argued, Russia's internal
vulnerabilities --- weak institutional legitimacy, national identity
issues, and contested borders --- constitute a domestic dimension of the
security dilemma. Authoritarian leaders fear destabilization by hostile
democratic powers and affiliated nongovernmental organizations promoting
change. These domestic insecurities lead to aggressive behaviors that
generate fears in Washington about Russian intentions, which then lead
to countermeasures.25

[[American officials]{.underline}]{.mark} for their part [[tend to
discount]{.underline}]{.mark} or simply do not recognize [[the threat
that democracy promotion]{.underline}]{.mark} and human rights advocacy
[[pose to authoritarian elites]{.mark}.]{.underline} Russia can justify
destabilization measures against Ukraine, the Baltic states, and other
post-Soviet states, together with cyber attacks and the development of
new weapons systems, as defensive measures in response to U.S. policies,
but in Washington they are perceived as offensive actions threatening
American interests. Leaders in Congress and the executive branch point
to Russian meddling in elections, Moscow's nuclear modernization
programs, the annexation of Crimea and stoking civil war in Ukraine,
support for rogue regimes in Syria and Venezuela, alignment with China,
and the poisoning of Kremlin opponents in the West. Washington's
response is to attempt to change Russian behavior largely through
economic sanctions, which allow the regime to blame the West for
Russia's economic troubles and stoke nationalism. Sanctions increase
distrust of the United States and support Putin's anti-Western narrative
but ultimately have failed to alter Russian behavior.26

Shiping Tang's analysis of the security dilemma provides a useful
framework for analyzing the U.S.-Russian relationship. Of the eight
"aspects" he identifies, three are central: "anarchy (which leads to
uncertainty, fear, and the need for self-help for survival or security),
a lack of malign intentions on both sides, and some accumulation of
power (including offensive capabilities)."27 Tang argues that a security
dilemma exists only within the framework of defensive realism, based on
the assumption that neither side has malign intentions, but that each is
merely seeking to enhance security through various means. From this
position, states have conflicts of interest that may be reconcilable or
irreconcilable and may be objective or subjective. Tang singles out
seven material regulators of the security dilemma: "geography, polarity,
military technology (that is, the objective offense-defense balance) ...
the distinguishability of offensive and defensive weapons ... asymmetric
power, external actors (allies), and concentration or mixing of ethnic
groups."28

Historically, [[Russia's **geographic vulnerability** has made
establishing **buffer zones** critical]{.mark} to national security.
Erosion of the buffer, as in NATO expansion eastward, is viewed by the
Kremlin as a threat to **vital security interests** and may result in
attempts to **reestablish** a **more secure perimeter**]{.underline} (as
in Ukraine). Regarding the second regulator --- polarity --- Moscow has
criticized the unipolar post-Cold War order as destabilizing and a
threat to Russian interests. Russia's "drifting authoritarianism" and
domestic problems, however, prevent reaching a bargain with its
adversaries on a new, more favorable international order.29 Third,
[[Russia is counting on]{.mark} recent [advances in **military
technology** to **offset perceived American superiority**]{.mark} in
conventional and offensive weaponry]{.underline}.

Fourth, [the two sides are fundamentally **at odds** over whether the
**European ballistic missile system** is defensive]{.underline} (the
U.S. and NATO position) [or offensive]{.underline} (the Russian claim).
[[Russian insecurity derives from **American** and **NATO
superiority**]{.mark} in conventional weaponry, [which]{.mark} has [led
Moscow to stress its **nuclear**]{.mark} and **retaliatory
[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thereby fueling Western
insecurity. Fifth, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [wields
**asymmetrical advantage** through the **NATO** alliance]{.underline}.
Russia has attempted to compensate for its relatively isolated position
with the Collective Security Treaty Organization and the Eurasian
Economic Union, but neither of these constitutes a security alliance
comparable to NATO. Finally, the ethnic dimension has factored into
Russian aggression against Ukraine and the frozen conflicts in Moldova
and Georgia. Defense of Russian compatriots could be used against NATO
member states Estonia and Latvia, heightening insecurity among
Washington's NATO allies.

While all seven regulators of the security dilemma are relevant to
U.S.-Russian relations, geography and fundamentally contrasting
geopolitical perceptions are critical and influence each nation's
security beliefs and commitments.30 Historically, [[Russian security has
been shaped by its **vulnerability to invasion**, resulting in]{.mark}
centuries of [**expansion**]{.mark} and the creation of **buffer zones**
to slow or deter aggressors]{.underline}.31 [Geographically, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has a **defensive advantage**
comparable to that of an **island nation**]{.underline}, though treaty
commitments to NATO and defense of liberal international norms have
created an American perception of pervasive threats beyond the North
American continent.

Russian and American leaders each believe the other side holds malign
intentions and has acted aggressively (that is, attempting to change the
status quo). But is that really the case? [Ascertaining malign intent is
**no easy task**]{.underline}. The most visible evidence comes from
states' military doctrines and capabilities, though it is almost always
debatable whether weapons are primarily offensive or defensive.
Perceptions of necessity are predicated on the worst-case scenario, to
ensure against potentially catastrophic threats. Other indications of
offensive intent may be the forcible acquisition of territory, forming
coalitions, or arms buildups.32 [In the context of anarchy and mutual
mistrust, **perception** is **more salient** than **objective
reality**]{.underline}.

The security dilemma does not come into play when one or both states act
offensively and seek to change the status quo, but as Jervis has
observed, "Few states are completely satisfied with the status quo."33
[To treat **satisfaction** or **dissatisfaction** with the status quo as
a **dichotomous** variable obscures a **range of motives**]{.underline}.
Hitler's revisionism in attempting to conquer Europe was quite different
from Putin's revisionism to regain control of Crimea and destabilize
Ukraine. [Moves **perceived** by one side as **offensive**, such as
controlling buffer territories or engaging in provocative actions, may
be viewed by the **other actor** as **defensive**]{.underline}. Jervis
notes that Soviet forces were arrayed in an offensive posture in Europe,
but the motive was to enhance security rather than initiate a war. He
concludes that while the East-West conflict was essentially a clash of
social systems, it did contain elements of the security dilemma.

After the Cold War ended, both Russia and the United States, following
an initial period of uncertainty and confusion, sought to revise the
European security order.34 In this context, though, it would have been
difficult for either actor to favor the status quo. The entire continent
was in flux, and the long-term outcome of this transformation was in
doubt. Deep ideological divisions no longer existed between the United
States and Russia, however, and national interests moved to the fore in
official calculations. Revisionism for a hegemonic United States meant
expanding and consolidating liberal democratic and market economy gains
resulting from the collapse of communism, a goal that encouraged NATO
expansion. Revisionism for a severely weakened Moscow consisted of
reestablishing spheres of interest befitting a great power along
Russia's periphery and securing recognition as Washington's coequal in
European affairs. Neither side may have been acting from offensive
motives, but responses by each to this new and uncertain security
environment in some instances led to a security dilemma spiral of
mistrust.

There is some evidence that Russia is motivated by revisionist, even
imperialist, goals and seeks to expand territorially beyond the gains
already made in Ukraine and Georgia. [There is]{.underline} also
**[considerable evidence]{.underline}** that [[Moscow is acting
**defensively** and]{.mark} has simply [**exploited**]{.mark} a
**[limited]{.mark} number of [opportunities]{.mark}** [to strengthen its
position]{.mark} **along the periphery**. Russian history]{.underline}
may be employed to support the claim for imperial expansion, or it [may
be used to justify Moscow's preoccupation with **threats from Europe**
and the need for **buffer zones**]{.underline}.35

If the security dilemma approach has explanatory value, then we should
observe frequent tit-for-tat responses on both sides to perceived
threatening moves by the other. [Russia and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [have objective conflicts of interest, but
[**mutual hostility**]{.mark} in recent years has **[expanded]{.mark}**
the number of both **real** and **perceived**]{.underline} (that is,
subjective) [[**disputes**, and]{.mark} has **[minimized]{.mark}** the
number of [**shared interests**. If]{.mark} subjective [conflicts of
interest are perceived as **irreconcilable**,]{.mark} the [potential for
**conflict** is **likely**]{.mark}]{.underline}, albeit avoidable.36
While it may be debatable that neither the United States nor Russia has
malign intentions (a necessity for the security dilemma to operate), [it
is **certainly** the case that [each side reads **hostile
intent**]{.mark} into the other's actions]{.underline}. The following
sections attempt to sort out the central perceptions on both sides
shaping the security dilemma, recognizing that it is extremely difficult
to assess intentions accurately.

#### Emboldenment\-\--waning unipolarity creates a moral hazard for states to cash in on the alliance

David M. Edelstein, Foreign Studies @ Georgetown, and Joshua R.
Itzkowitz **Shifrinson**, IR @ BU, **18**, "IT'S A TRAP! Security
commitments and the risks of entrapment" in *US Grand Strategy in the
21st Century,* Routledge.

What of unipolarity, where one power is dominant, as is the case with
the United States today? Prima facie, [entrapment should be extremely
rare in unipolarity. Allies are unlikely to materially affect the
unipole's security given the presumed material predominance]{.underline}
of a unipolar power; hence, the sole great power around does not need to
go to war on its allies' behalf. If pressed, a unipolar power can simply
cut the ally off and treat it as any other state.

[On further investigation]{.underline}, however, [the uniquely
advantageous strategic situation that [unipoles]{.mark} find themselves
in can paradoxically **[increase the likelihood of
entrapment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Because [unipolarity is such an
advantageous position for a state, a unipolar power has a powerful
temptation to roam the system and prevent other great powers from
rising]{.underline} and winnowing down its position. Assuming the
unipole will not itself engage in preventive wars to stop future
competitors, it [can either ally with local actors in order to use them
as proxies against a future threat, or ally with a prospective
challenger itself in order to influence it]{.underline} (Gavin 2015;
Ikenberry 2008). [Such behavior may be **[particularly]{.mark}
characteristic of [waning unipoles]{.mark}** [that are]{.mark}
increasingly [wary of the threat posed by other]{.mark} rising [great
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Both options allow the unipole's allies to g]{.underline}ain leverage
over its foreign policy, and [therefore risk entrapment.]{.underline} In
the first case, the unipole may need to back up allies in their disputes
with other relatively small states in order to ensure their help against
the prospective challenger. In the latter case, the unipole may need to
work at the prospective challenger's behest to keep the potential
challenger from opposing the unipole's dominance. In either case,
[shifting power can lead to a unipole's entrapment]{.underline}. On one
level, [shifting power dynamics can increase an ally's leverage over a
unipole's foreign policy]{.underline}. In particular, [if a unipole is
on the verge of seeing its dominance disappear altogether, allies take
on a **growing importance**]{.underline} in helping slow or stop the
rise of new peer competitors. Hence, any given ally can threaten to
defect from the unipole's coalition and hinder the unipole's ability to
address the looming threat unless the waning unipole fights on behalf of
the ally. Put differently, a prospective challenger's threat of
defection may undermine a unipole's dominance, making costly sacrifices
for an ally more attractive than would otherwise be the case. [The more
a unipole seeks to prevent the rise of new great powers]{.underline} --
[something most unipoles want]{.underline} -- [the greater the risk of
entrapment]{.underline} (Monteiro 2014).

[Shifting power also [increases the risk of **moral
hazard**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [a situation [in which an actor behaves
recklessly]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [knowing]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
[they have an insurance policy that will cover]{.mark} any
[losses]{.mark} they incur]{.underline}. In the case of alliance
politics, [smaller allies may act aggressively if they know that their
more powerful ally will come to their aid.]{.underline} Because some
allies are uniquely powerful or important to their partners, many
security commitments can end up being disproportionate to the threat
they address. Though any alliance can face [moral hazard
problems]{.underline} -- witness American concerns over European
recklessness during the Cold War -- they [are likely to be particularly
problematic in unipolar settings. Because unipoles are uniquely
powerful, the security commitments they hold exist in the absence of a
compelling military threat]{.underline} to the unipole itself. However,
the same may not apply for the unipole's allies. For them, the
international system remains a competitive environment in which other
states may challenge their security and other interests. [This asymmetry
is asking for trouble]{.underline}. For a unipole's allies, the best way
to guarantee victory in any conflict is to ensure the unipole enters the
contest on their behalf. In this sense, [**an alliance with a unipole is
the best kind of insurance** policy]{.underline}, [Allies of a unipole
have strong incentives to lie, cheat, and steal to convince a unipole to
come to their aid]{.underline}. Because the unipole itself may see
through the smokescreen, they also have incentives to manipulate events
to force a unipole's hand.

In turn, [shifts in power increase the unipole's exposure to moral
hazard]{.underline}. Because [power shifts can also work to the
disadvantage of a unipole's allies and]{.underline} -- crucially -- ar[e
likely to affect their security earlier than they affect a unipole's
security, [the risks of an]{.mark} ally [**seeking to cash in the
unipole's insurance** policy loom large.]{.mark}]{.underline} That is,
since a [[unipole's allies are unlikely to want to wait for a power
shift to occur before the unipole comes to their
aid]{.underline}]{.mark}, they have reason both to try to convince the
unipole that a rising state endangers international security and to
create a situation that buttresses this line of reasoning. The [goal of
such efforts is to increase the value of the alliance to the unipole and
short-circuit the unipole's own calculations regarding the distribution
of]{.underline} [power. [Moral hazard and power shifts can thus create a
**vicious cycle**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The United States, the unipolar era, and the risk of entrapment

The preceding discussion (summarized in Table 2.1) has large
implications for the United States. During the Cold War, bipolarity
constrained the importance of allies, limiting the risk of entrapment.
Moreover, the prospect of nuclear war discouraged risky behavior by the
superpowers and their allies. Today, however, [[the risk of
entrapment]{.mark} born of moral hazard and states' search for security
[is]{.mark} larger and possibly **[increasing]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[As long as the US continues to make commitments overseas]{.underline}
and fear the emergence of a peer competitor, [American partners will be
tempted to act in risky ways, expecting that Washington will feel
compelled to come to their rescue should they get into
trouble.]{.underline}

Insofar as the United States opposes Chinese or Russian aggression,
[[smaller states will]{.mark} be tempted to
**[provoke]{.mark}**]{.underline} China or [**[Russia to garner growing
American support]{.mark}**. If the United States is opposed to the
emergence of great power peer competitors, then it may]{.underline} well
[opt to come to the aid of smaller states]{.underline} threatened by
those potential competitors. This also means that countries that have
limited or no explicit security commitments from the United States may
try to profit from the insurance policy offered by the United States by
provoking conflicts and expecting the United States -- whose interests
are clear -- to ride to their defense.

#### Status dilemma\-\--symbolic recognition is necessary to avert warfare and prompt Russian realignment 

**Troitskiy 16** -- is Associate Professor at the Moscow State Institute
of International Relations (MGIMO), Senior Associate at the Russian
Academy of Sciences, and IMARES Program Professor at the European
University at St. Petersburg (Mikhail, "The Need to Massage Egos: Status
Politics as a Crucial Element of US-Russia Relations," *PONARS Eurasia*,
445)

Despite multiple official declarations of non-adversarial intentions
issued by the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} over the past quarter-century, both sides
have been unable to avoid repeated [[bouts of conflict
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}. This "unnecessary rivalry" [[can be
explained]{.underline}]{.mark} in part as [[a]{.mark} "[status
dilemma]{.mark}"]{.underline}---a concept modeled on the better-known
notion of "security dilemma." In the groundbreaking volume Status in
World Politics (T.V. Paul et al., 2014), [status is defined as
"collective beliefs about a given state's ranking on valued
attributes]{.underline}," such as "wealth, coercive capabilities,
culture, \[or\] demographic position." Status is assumed to consist of
two main components: "honor" and "authority." The former derives from
symbolic recognition of a given state's place in a certain hierarchy,
while the latter is the commonly accepted right of that state to use its
power or have a say on a range of issues that arguably affect its
interests. [A status dilemma is a situation in which an actor is seeking
status upgrades that other actors could concede at an acceptable cost to
their security, but instead]{.underline}---because of the uncertainty
surrounding the status-seeker's intentions---[these other actors develop
unnecessary fears]{.underline} of an attack being prepared against them
and begin responding. [[Failure to recognize the]{.mark} [status dilemma
can lead to material consequences]{.mark}, [such as]{.mark}]{.underline}
heightened tensions, arms races, or even **[[open
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Indeed, [[unresolved status]{.mark}
[dilemmas]{.mark}, [that is]{.mark}, [unwillingness]{.mark} of the sides
[to confer authority or honor]{.mark} on each other, [have led to the
growing rivalry]{.mark} between Russia and the United
States]{.underline} over the last quarter-century. At the same time,
[[opportunities exist for]{.mark} a virtually [cost-free accommodation
of]{.mark} mutual [status aspirations]{.mark}]{.underline};
[this]{.underline}, in turn, [could open up new avenues for
cooperation]{.underline} between the two sides. The Quest for Status in
US-Russia Relations The author of the status dilemma concept used it to
account for the spike in U.S.-Soviet tensions that occurred in early
1980s. In subsequent decades, status aspirations have remained a key
driver of Russia's policy toward the United States. [[Moscow has been
looking for]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[symbolic recognition]{.mark}
of]{.underline} a "great power plus" [status]{.underline} and, more
importantly, agreement by the Western powers to accept as legitimate and
accommodate Russia's statements of interest on a broad range of
international issues relevant to Moscow. [Russia's demands for "honor"
and concurrent emotions have included]{.underline}: - expressions of
gratitude to Moscow by the West for agreeing to end the Cold War; -
abstention by the West from raising legitimacy issues about various
aspects of Russian politics; - [symbolic trappings of an "equal
partnership," such as high-profile bilateral meetings]{.underline}
[between top Russian and U.S. leaders]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} -
"alliance jealousy"---attempts to outbid NATO and the EU in attracting
members to Russian-led blocs. For the last point above, [["alliance
jealousy," the discussion between Russia and the West about
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}'s alleged non-expansion pledge (whether issued
or not) [is driven by status politics. From today's perspective, the
eventual [accession of all Warsaw Pact countries to NATO paints Russia
as the loser in the Cold War]{.mark}]{.underline}---a snub to Gorbachev
and his successors who sought the status of co-victors in the Cold War
or, at least, co-beneficiaries of its termination. A country usually
seeks "honor" to satisfy the need of its leaders to identify with their
referent counterparts in other states (usually the world's most
powerful). In addition, a leader may value symbols of respect or other
special treatment by foreign counterparts because these symbolic acts
can easily be leveraged to raise the leader's domestic political
profile. It has been argued that the inability or unwillingness of the
West to give enough "honor" to Russia usually instigates Moscow's
frustration, and even fear of material reprisals being (covertly)
prepared against the aspiring actor. However, unmet honor aspirations
alone cannot fully account for conflicts of status. Symbolism in status
politics lacks the power to trigger a serious clash. Honor only becomes
relevant to the parties involved when bigger issues are at stake, such
as the shaping of the broad normative framework of international
governance or mutual recognition of great powers' spheres of influence.
This has been the case in U.S.-Russian relations. Moscow's grievances
usually surged when the United States and its allies were "adding injury
to insult," that is, deploying capabilities or developing doctrines that
the Kremlin perceived as material threats. In both the early 1980s and
2000s, these were the U.S. missile defenses (which threaten to diminish
the status-endowing role of Russia's nuclear weapons) and capabilities
suitable for prompt decapitation of the adversary, such as
intermediate-range missiles in Europe or conventional high-precision
long-range missiles. Later, Moscow's fears were stirred up by solidarism
doctrines (applied by the West in the former Yugoslavia) and regime
change policies (tested in Iraq and Libya and contemplated, the Russian
government is convinced, toward Syria and even Russia itself). For its
part, Washington has been seeking Moscow's recognition of the United
States' status as a "democracy guru" and a security provider to the
smaller powers. Moscow's efforts to deny those roles to the United
States have added acrimony to the bilateral relationship and reinforced
suspicions about mutual intentions. Breaking Out of the Status Dilemma?
Regardless of the difficulties of obtaining status satisfaction, some
authors in Status in World Politics have suggested that [aspiring
nations can]{.underline} sometimes [be granted status accommodation
by]{.underline} the [leading powers without the security of the latter
being undermined]{.underline}, the foundations of the international
legal order shattered, or the core hierarchy significantly changed.
According to that logic, [in order to break out of their status dilemma,
the United States and Russia would be advised to look for]{.underline}
ways of such [accommodation short of compromising their
security]{.underline}. Russia's role in its neighborhood and nuclear
arms control stand out as the two tracks in the U.S.-Russian
relationship that are richest in status-elevating opportunities for
Moscow. However, reassuring Russia of its privileged rights in the
post-Soviet neighborhood or forswearing missile defenses has proven
difficult for the United States without undermining the credibility of
NATO or compromising the idea of progress in defense technology. Two
other potentially fruitful areas for status signaling between Russia and
the United States are cyberspace and the Arctic. In cyberspace, simply
by negotiating with Russia, Washington could acknowledge Moscow's
comparable capabilities in the cyber domain. It would not be politically
difficult for the U.S. government to engage Russia in this sphere.
However, the lack of basic trust, undermined by controversies such as
the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails in July
2016, presents a serious obstacle. So far, Moscow and Washington have
only signed one agreement covering cyberspace terminology (2013) and
endorsed a consensus report prepared by the United Nations Group of
Government Experts in ICT (2015). While important, these documents fall
short of placing Russia on an equal footing with the United States as a
shaper of the norms of behavior in cyberspace. As a circumpolar nation
on par with the United States, Russia can claim an equal status when
negotiating Artic issues. Before the sanctions regime set in, Moscow was
presenting the Arctic as a key region where synergies were being
achieved by matching Russia's natural resources with advanced Western
technology---a variation of the "grand bargain" that Russia has been
seeking with the West. However, the problem with receiving status
signals from the United States on the Arctic is that Washington is
reluctant to acknowledge the importance of Arctic politics as such and
therefore to engage in it actively. In its turn, by militantly refusing
to acknowledge the role of the United States as an authority on
democratization and market reform, Moscow may be losing an opportunity
to accommodate U.S. status concerns. Acknowledging the United States as
the sole superpower and a "force for good" in international politics
would hardly turn away any of Moscow's significant partners and it could
help it win many more of them. The importance Washington attaches to the
acceptance of these signs of status by other powers was demonstrated by
the outsize media coverage and response to President Vladimir Putin's
seemingly low-profile statement recognizing the United States as the
sole superpower in his speech at the St. Petersburg International
Economic Forum in June 2016. In fact, a number of "honor" signals
between the sides allowed them to build trust and engage in cooperation
on key security and economic issues. Former president George W. Bush's
positive assessment of Putin as a leader in June 2001 no doubt
facilitated the decision of the latter to help the former in his
anti-Taliban campaign in Afghanistan. The symbolism of the "reset"
policy announced by Washington in March 2009 generated a strong momentum
for U.S.-Russian arms control negotiations and cooperation in curbing
Iran's nuclear program. Challenges to Status Accommodation Despite the
presence of status reassurance opportunities, the obstacles to making
full use of them are significant. Analogies drawn between the
traditional security dilemma and the status dilemma do not extend to
ways of overcoming the two types of dilemmas. The status dilemma is
easier to resolve because opportunities are usually available to block
the demands of a status-concerned state without engaging in material
escalation in the form of an arms race or brinkmanship behavior.
Russia's quest to raise its status vis-a-vis the United States has been
met with a number of challenges. First, [[in]{.mark} [order to compel
its counterparts to recognize Moscow's status]{.mark}, [the Kremlin has
often had to undertake risky policy maneuvering. For example, Moscow
sought a "strategic alliance" with China]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
launched a military campaign in Syria to defeat President Bashar
al-Assad's enemies to a significant extent in order to beef up Russia's
profile in the eyes of the West. These are not classical balancing acts
because the United States was not directly challenged by either of these
Russian moves. [Russia was trying to show that it was an indispensable
actor in areas of interest to the United States and that Moscow has
strategic options other than alignment with Washington]{.underline} (and
its allies). However, once Moscow's partners---China, Syria, and
Iran---understood that Russia's aspirations were status-focused, they
began to question Russia's commitment to their shared goals. Beijing,
Tehran, and Damascus all balked at Russia's attempts to harness them in
pursuit of the Kremlin's own agendas. China is clearly not interested in
precipitating a showdown with the United States over their manifold
contradictions and does not rule out an eventual mutually-beneficial
compromise. Iran made a public case in August 2016 of denying the
Russian Air Force permanent basing rights on Iranian territory despite
Moscow's earlier announcement that an agreement to that effect had been
reached. In his turn, Assad implicated Russia in an aerial campaign to
bomb eastern Aleppo in October 2016, a move that led to a major
conflagration between Russia and the West (costing, at the very least,
the extension of U.S./EU sanctions on Russia beyond January 2017).
Second, it turned out to be easy for Russia's rivals to inflict a
substantial amount of pain on Kremlin policymakers by simply ignoring
Moscow. As long as negotiation with an aspiring nation is usually seen
as a status-conferring signal, refusing to engage in negotiation works
as a status-diminishing signal. Such blackballing tactics proved to be
almost cost-free, but effective in exerting psychological pressure and
pushing Moscow toward costly, risky, and at times erratic maneuvers.
Third, even when Russia's counterparts have been willing to accommodate
its status demands to a certain extent, Moscow has usually found it
difficult (or unnecessary) to signal the scope of its status
aspirations. These aspirations could range from symbolic and moderate
(bilateral negotiations and handshakes) to authority-based and virtually
limitless (recognized right to have a say on every problem of
significance). Uncertainty generates strong balancing behavior vis-a-vis
the state that seeks an elevated status because its counterparts become
concerned that, under the guise of status pursuit, Moscow could obtain
clout incommensurate to its actual resources and responsibility. For
example, one of the key goals of Moscow's Syria campaign has been to
elevate Russia's global status by presenting it as a diligent great
power committed to eradicating the Islamic State. However, the U.S.-led
coalition has remained reluctant to confer that status on Russia by
cooperating with Moscow in Syria because the coalition feared that what
Russia actually was to harness coalition forces into eradicating all
rivals to the Assad government that would then become Moscow's dedicated
client in the Middle East. Fourth, breaking the rules is a powerful
means of a quick elevation of status under an acute "status thirst."
Russia has regarded as a major sign of high status the ability to break
the rules that it dislikes (and introduce its own rules and norms).
However, rule-breaking behavior triggers a stronger negative response
than rule generation. Russia is finding it difficult to achieve "status
upgrades" by building new normative structures---for example, in
governance of outer space or cyberspace. When Russia went the way of a
rule-challenger vis-a-vis the Ukraine conflict, it triggered stronger
resistance from the West than it expected. Finally, the quest for
"honor," which is typical of Russia's status aspirations, can sometimes
adversely affect other aspects of status. For example, membership in a
prestigious international organization raises a country's status, but
the need to observe the corresponding norms limits that country's
freedom of action. If entry into clubs is pursued by an actor with a
view to elevating its status, that actor will need to assess the balance
between membership and the ensuing normative constraints.
Characteristically, Russia seemed to be prepared for expulsion from a
number of clubs as it was embarking on a risky course of action toward
Ukraine in 2014. Moscow valued assertion of its "right" to break the
rules as a sign of status more than membership in the G8 or in the
Council of Europe---mostly because the Kremlin felt that the
prestige-to-constraint balance was unfavorable for Russia in those
Western-dominated institutions. At the same time, [Russia attached
disproportionate value to participation in]{.underline} other
[institutions that do not entail many constraints but which can
contribute to national self-esteem]{.underline}. Take, for example, the
Rio Olympics, where Moscow took the banning of many Russian athletes
with more pain and resentment than Russia's expulsion from the G8 in
2014. Conclusion [[Status aspirations play a significant role in]{.mark}
U.S.-Russia [relations]{.mark}. [They]{.mark}]{.underline} may even
[[play a bigger role in generating the persistent rivalry]{.mark}
between the two nations [than]{.mark} do [traditional security
considerations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Mutual status accommodation by both
sides, while hypothetically possible, has been difficult even in areas
where it could occur without damaging either of their material
interests. [[Each side has generally preferred to block each other's
status aspirations]{.underline}]{.mark}, at times [[pushing each other
toward risky behavior]{.mark}, [which can lead to]{.mark}]{.underline} a
**[[serious escalation of tensions and]{.underline}]{.mark}** even an
**[[armed conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[The first is that American [policymakers think]{.mark} that [because
neither side wants nuclear war, then such a war is very unlikely to
occur]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia would be foolish, we reason, to cross
swords with the powerful U.S. military and risk its own
self-destruction, and many Americans find it hard to imagine that modern
cyber duels, proxy battles, information operations and economic warfare
might somehow erupt into direct nuclear attacks. If the Cold War ended
peacefully, the thinking goes, why should America worry that a new
shadow war with a much less formidable Russia will end any differently?

But **[[wars do not always begin by design]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Just
as they did in 1914, [a vicious circle of [clashing geopolitical
ambitions, distorted perceptions of]{.mark} each other's [intent, new
and poorly understood technologies]{.mark}, and disappearing rules of
the game could [combine to produce a disaster]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[neither side wants nor expects.]{.underline}]{.mark}

advanced [hypersonic]{.mark} weapons delivery systems [and antisatellite
weaponry are making the U.S.-Russian shadow war]{.mark}]{.underline}
much [[more complex and dangerous]{.mark} than the old Cold War
competition]{.underline}. They are [[**blurring traditional**
lines]{.mark} between espionage and warfare, [**entangling nuclear and
conventional weaponry**, and erasing]{.mark} old [distinctions between

development of nuclear weaponry in the Cold War produced the concept of
mutually assured destruction and had a restraining effect, [in the cyber

defense.]{.underline} And in a highly connected world in which financial

The move comes as the administration is proposing to increase spending
to more than \$44 billion next year to continue and, in some cases,
accelerate programs to replace and upgrade all the major elements of the
bloated U.S. arsenal. Unless curtailed, the plan, which departs in
important ways from long-standing U.S. policies, will accelerate [global
nuclear competition]{.underline} and [increase]{.underline} the [risk of
**nuclear war**]{.underline}. As if to underscore the dangers of the
administration's strategy, the Defense Department led an exercise last
month simulating a limited nuclear war. "The scenario included a
[European contingency]{.underline}.... [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}
decides to [[use a]{.mark} **low-yield**, [**limited nuclear weapon**
against]{.mark}]{.underline} a site on **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**
territory," and [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[fires back with a "**limited" nuclear
response**]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to the Pentagon. The U.S.
response presumably involved the low-yield sub-launched warhead, known
as the W76-2. The exercise perpetuates the dangerous illusion that a
nuclear war can be fought and won. The new warhead, which packs a
five-kiloton explosive yield, is large enough destroy a large city. It
would be delivered on the same type of long-range ballistic missile
launched from the same strategic submarine that carries missiles loaded
with 100-kiloton strategic warheads. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n
military leaders would be [[**hard pressed** to know, in the **heat
of**]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[**crisis**,]{.mark} whether the missile
was part of a "**limited" strike** or the first wave of an **all-out**
nuclear **attack**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, Trump officials insist
that the president needs "more credible" nuclear use options to deter
the possible first use of nuclear weapons by Russia. In reality, [[once
nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} of any kind [[are]{.mark}
[detonated]{.mark} in a conflict between nuclear]{.underline}-armed
[adversaries, [there is **no guarantee** against a **cycle of

The End of the Security Order of Paris [With Moscow's invasion of

[destroyed]{.underline} these chances for negotiated solutions, and with
them [the cooperative European security order of Paris]{.underline}. The
NATO-Russia Founding Act, the European Security Charter, and the Minsk
Agreement are obsolete. [Putin's new narra­tive of a non-existent
Ukrainian nation]{.underline} and its historic impetus of returning to
Russia the territories of a former empire now [seems to superimpose
security concerns]{.underline} in order to justify the use of force for
domestic consumption. [However, the Russian president has ob­viously
underestimated the Ukrainian deter­mination]{.underline} to resist and
the resolve of the West. He will now achieve what he wanted to avoid,
namely a more united Ukrainian nation, a more united and stronger NATO
and EU, and an unprecedented military strengthening of NATO's eastern
flank. In addition, he will have to face significant economic,
financial, and political isolation with serious long-term effects. [If
Russian forces get bogged down]{.underline} in nasty and time-consuming
street fighting in Ukraine's cities while their losses mount, [Putin
will also face a dramatic loss of repu­tation internally]{.underline},
[with unpredictable con­sequences]{.underline}. At the dawn of a new era,
there seems to be little prospect for any new agreements. As long as the
future of Ukraine is unclear, the outlines of a future inclusive
European security order, its principles, borders, and spheres of
influence will not appear. How­ever, **[a new military confrontation
between Russia and the West along a fortified con­tact line will carry
high risks of military incidents, miscalculations, and further
escalation]{.underline}**. Therefore, [stabilizing measures]{.underline}
such as direct communication between mili­tary headquarters, tight rules
for in­cident prevention, as well as [de-escalation, transparency, and
restrictions of military movements]{.underline} [will be needed even
more urgently to prevent the worst]{.underline}. This will require new
talks and security arrangements once the fog of war has cleared.

[Russia's military offensive against Ukraine is an act of
aggression]{.underline} that [will make already worrisome tensions
between Nato and Moscow even more dangerous]{.underline}. The west's new
cold war with Russia has turned hot. [Vladimir Putin bears primary
responsibility]{.underline} for this latest development, [but Nato's
arrogant, tone‐​deaf policy toward Russia over the past quarter‐​century
deserves a large share as well]{.underline}. [Analysts committed to a US
foreign policy of realism and restraint have warned for more than a
quarter‐​century that continuing to expand the most powerful military
alliance in history toward another major power would not end
well]{.underline}. [The war in Ukraine provides definitive
confirmation]{.underline} that it did not. Thinking through the Ukraine
crisis -- the causes "It would be extraordinarily difficult to expand
Nato eastward without that action's being viewed by Russia as
unfriendly. Even the most modest schemes would bring the alliance to the
borders of the old Soviet Union. Some of the more ambitious versions
would have the alliance virtually surround the Russian Federation
itself." I wrote those words in 1994, in my book Beyond Nato: Staying
Out of Europe's Wars, at a time when expansion proposals merely
constituted occasional speculation in foreign policy seminars in New
York and Washington. I added that [expansion "would constitute a
needless provocation of Russia]{.underline}". What was not publicly
known at the time was that Bill Clinton's administration had already
made the fateful decision the previous year to push for including some
former Warsaw Pact countries in Nato. The administration would soon
propose inviting Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to become
members, and the US Senate approved adding those countries to the North
Atlantic Treaty in 1998. It would be the first of several waves of
membership expansion. Even that first stage provoked Russian opposition
and anger. In her memoir, Madeleine Albright, Clinton's secretary of
state, concedes that "\[Russian president Boris\] Yeltsin and his
[countrymen were strongly opposed to enlargement]{.underline}, [seeing
it as a strategy for exploiting their vulnerability]{.underline} and
moving Europe's dividing line to the east, leaving them isolated."
Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary of state, similarly described the
Russian attitude. "[**Many Russians see Nato as a vestige of the cold
war**, inherently directed against their country]{.underline}. They
point out that they have disbanded the Warsaw Pact, their military
alliance, and ask why the west should not do the same." It was an
excellent question, and neither the Clinton administration nor its
successors provided even a remotely convincing answer. George Kennan,
the intellectual father of America's containment policy during the cold
war, perceptively warned in a May 1998 New York Times interview about
what the Senate's ratification of Nato's first round of expansion would
set in motion. "I think it is the beginning of a new cold war," Kennan
stated. "I think [the Russians will gradually react quite adversely and
it will affect their policies]{.underline}. I think it is a tragic
mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was threatening
anybody else." He was right, but US and Nato leaders proceeded with new
rounds of expansion, including the provocative step of adding the three
Baltic republics. Those countries not only had been part of the Soviet
Union, but they had also been part of Russia's empire during the Czarist
era. That wave of expansion now had Nato perched on the border of the
Russian Federation. [Moscow's patience with Nato's ever more intrusive
behavior was wearing thin]{.underline}. [The last reasonably friendly
warning from Russia]{.underline} that the alliance needed to back off
[came in March]{.underline} 2007, when Putin addressed the annual Munich
security conference. "[Nato has put its frontline forces on our
borders]{.underline}," [Putin complained. Nato expansion "represents a
serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust]{.underline}.
And we have the right to ask: against whom is this expansion intended?
And what happened to the assurances our western partners made after the
dissolution of the Warsaw Pact?" In his memoir, Duty, Robert M Gates,
who served as secretary of defense in the administrations of both George
W Bush and Barack Obama, stated his belief that "[the relationship with
Russia had been badly mismanaged]{.underline} after \[George HW\] Bush
left office in 1993". Among other missteps, "US agreements with the
Romanian and Bulgarian governments to rotate troops through bases in
those countries was a needless provocation." In an implicit rebuke to
the younger Bush, Gates asserted that "trying to bring Georgia and
Ukraine into Nato was truly overreaching". That move, he contended, was
a case of "recklessly ignoring what the Russians considered their own
vital national interests". The following year, the Kremlin demonstrated
that its discontent with Nato's continuing incursions into Russia's
security zone had moved beyond verbal objections. Moscow exploited a
foolish provocation by Georgia's pro‐​western government to launch a
military offensive that brought Russian troops to the outskirts of the
capital. Thereafter, Russia permanently detached two secessionist‐​minded
Georgian regions and put them under effective Russian control. Western
(especially US) leaders continued to blow through red warning light
after a red warning light, however. The Obama administration's
shockingly arrogant meddling in Ukraine's internal political affairs in
2013 and 2014 to help demonstrators overthrow Ukraine's elected,
pro‐​Russia president was the single most brazen provocation, and it
caused tensions to spike. Moscow immediately responded by seizing and
annexing Crimea, and a new cold war was underway with a vengeance. Could
the Ukraine crisis have been avoided? [Events during the past few months
constituted the last chance to avoid a hot war in eastern
Europe]{.underline}. [Putin demanded that Nato provide guarantees on
several security issues]{.underline}. [Specifically]{.underline}, the
Kremlin wanted binding assurances that [the alliance would reduce the
scope of its growing military presence]{.underline} in eastern Europe
and would never offer membership to Ukraine. He backed up those demands
with a massive military buildup on Ukraine's borders. [The Biden
administration's response]{.underline} to Russia's quest for meaningful
western concessions and security guarantees [was tepid and
evasive]{.underline}. [Putin then clearly decided to escalate
matters]{.underline}. Washington's attempt to make Ukraine a Nato
political and military pawn (even absent the country's formal membership
in the alliance) may end up costing the Ukrainian people dearly. The
Ukraine tragedy History will show that [Washington's treatment of Russia
in the decades following the demise of the Soviet Union was a policy
blunder of epic proportions]{.underline}. It was [entirely predictable
that Nato expansion would ultimately lead to]{.underline} a tragic,
perhaps violent, [breach of relations with Moscow]{.underline}.
Perceptive analysts warned of the likely consequences, but those
warnings went unheeded. We are now paying the price for the US foreign
policy establishment's myopia and arrogance.

#### Conventional weapons don't matter\-\-- post-Ukraine Russia uses nukes.

Eric **Gomez 06-09**-2022 \[Director of Defense Policy Studies, Cato
Institute; Cato Institute; "The Bad 'Ol Days: Where Russia's Nuclear
Strategy Goes After Ukraine;"
https://www.cato.org/commentary/bad-ol-days-where-russias-nuclear-strategy-goes-after-ukraine//ZW\]

[The war in Ukraine could produce a more aggressive Russian nuclear
strategy than the one it had prior to the conflict]{.underline}. The
poor performance of Russia's conventional forces are creating a mix of
structural conditions that is similar to the collapse of the Soviet
Union. Based on Russia's approach in the post‐​Soviet period[, it will
likely place greater emphasis on limited nuclear options and have a
lower threshold for nuclear first use]{.underline}. [A more aggressive
Russian nuclear doctrine would have serious implications for U.S.
extended deterrence in Europe]{.underline}, [especially as Sweden and
Finland call for NATO membership]{.underline}. During the collapse of
the Soviet Union Russia's conventional military was large but of
generally poor quality, and a weakened economy meant that rapid
improvements in military technology were going to take time. Moscow
opted to make up for its conventional weakness by increasing the
prominence of nuclear weapons for national security and adopting more
aggressive doctrines of nuclear use. [Without viable, conventional means
to protect against NATO's more advanced military forces]{.underline},
[Russia would reach for limited nuclear options early]{.underline} in a
conflict [to demonstrate resolve and the risks of continued
aggression]{.underline}. As Russia modernized its conventional military
forces during the 2000s and 2010s it improved its ability to deter
conflict and control escalation without crossing the nuclear threshold.
These improvements were correlated with changes in nuclear doctrine that
set a comparatively higher bar for nuclear weapons use. To be clear,
Russian strategy still allows for nuclear use in a wide variety of
circumstances, including if a conventional war threatens "the very
existence of the state." However, compared to the nuclear strategy it
adopted in the immediate aftermath of the Soviet Union's collapse,
Russia's current nuclear strategy is relatively less aggressive.
[Russia's invasion of Ukraine is creating three consequences and
conditions that will likely lead Moscow to rely more on its nuclear
forces going forward]{.underline}. First, [the war in Ukraine
demonstrates the limitations of Russia's conventional military
modernization]{.underline}. Russia's military has significantly
underperformed in Ukraine, despite employing many of its most potent
capabilities. Western military aid keeps flowing into Ukraine despite
[Russian warnings of consequences and the weapons being sent to Ukraine
do not represent the most advanced capabilities that NATO could bring to
bear in a direct conflict with Russia]{.underline}. Russian military
power, while capable of inflicting a great deal of damage, still lags
behind NATO. [The United States should tread very carefully]{.underline}
on the issue of NATO expansion. Second, Russia will face significant
hurdles in correcting this conventional imbalance because its economy is
reeling from economic sanctions imposed because of its decision to
attack Ukraine. [The exposed weaknesses of the Russian military
are]{.underline} therefore [likely to persist for an extended
period]{.underline}. [Adjusting nuclear strategy is an attractive option
for Russia because it can be done quickly and on the cheap]{.underline}.
Third, [the likely addition of Finland and Sweden to the NATO alliance
will push on Russia's high threat perceptions]{.underline}. In early
April, Russian officials warned that admitting the two countries to the
alliance would lead to Russian countermoves, including greater
deployments of nuclear forces in the Baltic region. Adding Finland to
the alliance would greatly improve NATO's ability to target Russia's
Zapadnaya Litsa naval base, which hosts ballistic missile submarines,
and nearby strategic nuclear weapons storage facilities. Putin brought
this situation upon himself by invading Ukraine. Still, [it is within
the United States' interest to reduce the likelihood of Russia adopting
a more aggressive nuclear strategy]{.underline}. Failing that, [the
United States should reduce nuclear danger stemming from a potential
shift in Russian strategy]{.underline}. The United States should tread
very carefully on the issue of NATO expansion. Sweden and Finland's rush
to join the alliance is understandable but because of Russian threat
perceptions, U.S. extended nuclear deterrence becomes more complicated.
If Sweden and Finland's admission to NATO is a foregone conclusion, [the
next best way to reduce nuclear risk would be for the alliance to
refrain from deploying missile defense and long‐​range conventional
strike systems on the new members' territory]{.underline}. Moscow has
repeatedly cited both types of capabilities as especially threatening to
the survivability of its nuclear deterrent. A NATO deployment of
long‐​range conventional strike weapons to Finland would be especially
threatening given the proximity of the nuclear submarine base at
Zapadnaya Litsa. [Russia's nuclear strategy is likely heading to a bad
place]{.underline}. Its invasion of Ukraine is laying bare the
shortcomings of conventional force modernization while also encouraging
NATO expansion and worsening Russia's general security environment. [The
United States should be aware of the long‐​term risks and consequences of
a more aggressive Russian nuclear strategy]{.underline}. [Restraint
could help lessen the blow]{.underline}.

#### US involvement in NATO increases risk of conflict with Russia.

Ted Galen **Carpenter** 01-08-**2022** \[Senior Fellow at the Cato
Institute, The Cato Institute, "NATO Security Dependents Are Not Useful
Allies,"
https://www.cato.org/commentary/nato-security-dependents-are-not-useful-allies//ZW\]

SINCE THE end of World War II, [U.S. officials have had an unduly
expansive concept of what constitutes worthwhile strategic allies for
the United States]{.underline}. In too many cases, the
"[allies]{.underline}" that Washington touts [are small, weak, often
militarily useless dependents]{.underline}. [Worse, some of them are on
bad terms with more powerful neighboring states]{.underline}. Under
those circumstances, [the so‐​called allies are major liabilities rather
than assets to the United States]{.underline}. Indeed,
[they]{.underline} are potential snares, ones that [can entangle America
in unnecessary military confrontations]{.underline}. Washington would do
well to become far more selective about which nations it includes in its
roster of allies, and U.S. leaders should stop elevating security
dependents to the status of allies. When U.S. officials described the
regimes that Washington installed through military force in Afghanistan
and Iraq as allies, it became clear that they had lost even minimal
understanding of the concept. That point became abundantly evident when
their Afghan client collapsed almost overnight in the face of the
Taliban military offensive. [It's time for U.S. policymakers to do
better]{.underline}. TROUBLING PROMISCUITY about acquiring weak U.S.
security partners was evident even during the Cold War, and the tendency
has become even more pronounced in the post‐​Cold War era. As the fiasco
in Afghanistan (and its ugly predecessor in South Vietnam) confirmed,
that problem with U.S. foreign policy has existed in multiple regions.
However, [the defect has become most acute with respect to Washington's
campaign to expand NATO into Eastern Europe]{.underline}. Since the
mid‐​1990s, U[.S. administrations have worked to add a menagerie of new
NATO members]{.underline}, and it has done so [with even less
selectivity and good judgment than some people use to acquire Facebook
friends]{.underline}. Many of those new members have very little to
offer to the United States as security partners. Indeed, some are
mini‐​states, bordering on being micro‐​states. Such lightly armed
Lilliputians would add little or nothing to Washington's own
capabilities---especially in a showdown with another major power. As
economic assets, their importance is decidedly limited, and militarily,
they are even less valuable. It's hard to see how new NATO allies such
as Albania, Slovenia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia enhance America's
power and security. That point should be apparent based on size of
population alone. Albania's 2.87 million, North Macedonia's 2.1 million,
and Slovenia's 2.07 million people put those countries squarely in the
mini‐​state category, while Montenegro's 628,000 barely deserves even
that label. It doesn't get much better with respect to either annual
gross domestic product or size of military forces. Even Slovenia's
\$52.8 billion GDP puts that country only eighty‐​sixth in the global
rankings. Albania's \$15.2 billion (125th), North Macedonia's \$12.26
billion (135th) and Montenegro's \$4.78 billion (159th) are even less
impressive. [The military forces that our new NATO allies can field are
not likely to strike fear into Russia or any other would‐​be
aggressor]{.underline}. Albania's armed forces consist of 8,500
active‐​duty personnel, Slovenia's consist of 8,500, and North Macedonia
has 9,000 available. Montenegro's active‐​duty force totals 2,400. In
comparison, the Austin, Texas, police department has 2,422 people in its
ranks. Granted, the Cold War edition of NATO also had some mini‐​states
as members, most notably Luxembourg and Iceland. However, those members
were located within a stable, democratic Western Europe. Their defense
also was geographically inseparable from Washington's mission of
protecting important military and economic players, such as West
Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Great Britain, from what appeared to
be a totalitarian superpower with expansionist ambitions. That situation
was qualitatively different from Washington's gratuitous post‐​Cold War
decision to manage the security of quarrelsome mini‐​states in the
chronically volatile Balkans. [Since the mid‐​1990s, the United States
has entangled itself in the region's parochial spats, but giving some of
the countries NATO membership intensified America's exposure to needless
risks and burdens]{.underline}. [THE RISK-BENEFIT calculation is even
worse with respect to some of the other small nations that have joined
NATO in the post‐​Cold War era]{.underline}. [Those partners]{.underline}
are not merely irrelevant from the standpoint of U.S. security; they
[are potentially dangerous tripwires that could trigger a conflict
between the United States and a nuclear‐​armed Russia]{.underline}. That
point underscores one very important difference between individuals
casually amassing Facebook friends and the United States promiscuously
adding new security mendicants. [Facebook friends do not have the
ability to entangle anyone in armed conflicts; irresponsible security
dependents definitely can do so]{.underline}. Indeed, there are multiple
examples throughout history of such clients snaring their patrons into
devastating, unnecessary wars. One notable example was how Tsarist
Russia's fateful decision to give strong backing to Serbia in the
latter's escalating quarrel with Austria‐​Hungary following the
assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand helped ignite World War
I---and caused the utter ruin of the Russian empire. [The United States
is flirting with]{.underline} a similar [danger today regarding its
small clients in Eastern Europe]{.underline}. President George W.
[Bush's decision to support the NATO membership bids of the three Baltic
republics]{.underline} was---and [remains]{.underline}---[highly
provocative to Russia]{.underline}. One crucial way to reduce the danger
of armed clashes between great powers is to show mutual respect for
respective spheres of influence. [Washington has repeatedly violated
that principle by pushing NATO to expand right up to Russia's
border.]{.underline} The addition of the Baltic republics in 2004 was
the most dangerous step in that process. As in the case of the
subsequent addition of the small Balkan nations to NATO, the three
Baltic countries have little to offer in terms of military capabilities.
Estonia's 6,700 troops, Latvia's 5,500, and even Lithuania's 20,500
wouldn't be much of a factor if war broke out between NATO and Russia.
However, [the drawbacks of making the Baltic republics U.S. security
dependents go far beyond their irrelevance as military
players]{.underline}. [Those three countries were once part of both
Tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union]{.underline}, and substantial ethnic
Russian minorities still live in both Estonia and Latvia. The Kremlin
has complained on numerous occasions since the Baltic republics became
independent at the end of 1991 that the Russian population suffers
discrimination and other mistreatment. Indeed, that allegation emerged
long before Russian president Vladimir Putin became Russia's leader.
[Relations between the Kremlin and its former territories remain tense
because of that issue]{.underline}. Perhaps even more troubling,
[Washington's Baltic allies now are feuding with Moscow's principal
client in the region, Belarus]{.underline}. In the summer and autumn of
2021, Latvia and Lithuania (along with the European Union) accused
Belarus of trying to use a flood of Middle East refugees as a form of
"hybrid warfare." The Lithuanian government even told its border guards
to use force if necessary to prevent the continued entry of the
migrants. A short time later, Latvia imposed a state of emergency to
deal with the same issue. A few weeks earlier, Lithuania had augmented
its border barrier by erecting a fence with razor wire. Latvia soon
followed suit. A new round of large‐​scale, Russia‐​Belarus military
exercises (held every four years) in September made tensions even more
acute. By virtue of both size and location, the Baltic republics are not
credible strategic assets for the United States. Indeed, they would be
virtually helpless if Russia made a military move against them. A 2016
RAND Corporation study concluded that a Russian offensive would overrun
their defenses in approximately three days. [Such countries]{.underline}
are not U.S. "allies" in any meaningful sense; they are vulnerable
dependents that [could trigger a war between NATO]{.underline}
(primarily the United States) [and Russia]{.underline}. Washington's
patron‐​client relationship with the Baltic republics is risky, and U.S.
leaders were unwise to push for their inclusion in NATO. However,
beginning with George W. Bush's administration, officials have engaged
in even more reckless conduct regarding possible alliance membership for
two other countries, Georgia and Ukraine. They have done so despite
repeated warnings from the Kremlin that making either country
(especially Ukraine) a NATO member would cross a red line that Moscow
cannot tolerate. BUSH CONDUCTED a veritable geopolitical love affair
with both Georgia and Ukraine, portraying them as models for emerging
democracies and repeatedly referring to them as U.S. allies in the most
glowing terms. Only firm French and German opposition thwarted Bush's
lobbying effort to get NATO to grant Tbilisi and Kiev membership. Berlin
and Paris were troubled by evidence of endemic political and economic
corruption in both countries, but they were even more worried that
further NATO expansion would create a crisis with Moscow. Their
continued opposition has thus far prevented the addition of Georgia and
Ukraine to NATO's ranks, even as the alliance added multiple Balkan
mini‐​states. However, [U.S. actions have increasingly made the issue of
formal membership a distinction without a difference,]{.underline} and
the outcomes indicate that even unwise informal security relations with
client states can cause serious trouble. Bush encouraged Georgia to take
a firmer stance against the continued presence of Russian "peacekeeping
troops" in two breakaway regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. In
addition, the United States was busily equipping and training Georgian
military forces. Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, apparently
read too much into Washington's expressions of support. In August 2008,
his forces launched an attack on Russian units in South Ossetia, and
Moscow responded with a full‐​scale offensive that soon overran much of
Georgia. When Saakashvili begged for U.S. and NATO help to repel the
Russian "aggression," Bush expressed firm support for Georgia's
sovereignty, but he also indicated that U.S. troops would not be coming
to Tbilisi's rescue. A U.S. client had tried to create a military
confrontation between NATO and Russia for its own parochial goals, but
it had misread Washington's signals. Clumsy U.S. policy, though, was at
least partly responsible for that dangerous episode. Unfortunately, the
actions of subsequent foreign policy teams with respect to Georgia, and
even more so with respect to Ukraine, indicate that U.S. leaders learned
nothing from the mistakes in 2008. [Officials in both the Trump and
Biden administrations have treated Kiev as a de facto NATO
member]{.underline} and a crucial U.S. military ally. Trump's
administration approved multiple weapons shipments to Kiev, sales that
included Javelin anti‐​tank missiles that Russia considers especially
destabilizing. Such transactions have continued since Joe Biden entered
the White House. Worse, Washington's security relationship with Kiev
goes far beyond arms sales. Over the past five years, U.S. forces have
conducted multiple joint exercises (war games) with Ukrainian units.
Washington also has successfully pressed NATO to include Ukraine in the
alliance's war games. Indeed, Ukraine hosted and led the latest version,
Rapid Trident 21. It is no secret that such exercises are directed
against Russia. In early April 2021, Biden assured Ukraine's president,
Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Washington's "unwavering support for Ukraine's
sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia's ongoing
aggression." Such a pledge places the United States in a very dangerous
situation. Kiev seeks to regain Crimea, which Russia annexed following
U.S. and European Union backing for demonstrators who overthrew
Ukraine's elected, pro‐​Russian president in 2014. Indeed, Zelenskyy and
other Ukrainian officials have expressed that intention repeatedly and
in diverse settings. Kiev's behavior also has become disturbingly
bellicose. In early April 2021, both the Zelenskyy government and NATO
complained loudly when Russia moved some 80,000 troops and heavy
weaponry closer to Crimea and other areas along the border with Ukraine.
What they did not mention, and most Western press accounts also ignored,
was that Kiev had previously executed its own military buildup, amid
statements of a determination to regain Crimea. In any case, an
extremely tense confrontation between NATO and Russia ensued, which was
not resolved until Russia pulled back its forces in late April. Given
the size of its territory and population, Ukraine is not in the same
category as the Balkan and Baltic mini‐​states or Georgia. However, it
has an even greater potential to entangle the United States and the rest
of NATO in a perilous war. The April 2021 episode was a classic case of
a security client behaving in ways that could trigger an armed conflict.
For all of Kiev's boasts about regaining Crimea, the outcome of a
military clash between Russia and Ukraine would be a foregone
conclusion. Ukraine would have no chance of prevailing without massive
outside assistance. Even disregarding the crucial difference that Russia
possesses a strategic and tactical nuclear arsenal, while Ukraine does
not, Russia's advantages in conventional forces are massive. Legislation
that the Ukrainian parliament approved in July 2021 will increase Kiev's
armed forces to 261,000, but Russia fields more than 1 million
active‐​duty personnel. Moreover, although U.S. aid has improved the
quality of the hardware available to Ukraine, Russia's troops are
equipped with some of the most sophisticated weapons in the world. U.S.
leaders should be deeply concerned when a security dependent suffering
from such quantitative and qualitative disadvantages makes empty boasts
about retaking lost territory. It is even more worrisome when that
client engages in provocative military gestures toward its powerful
neighbor. That is precisely the way that a rogue dependent can entangle
its great power protector in a disastrous war. [U.S. leaders should want
no part of such a risky patron‐​client relationship]{.underline}. THE
TEST of whether a specific country is a worthwhile U.S. ally or a
useless, perhaps dangerous, dependent should not be terribly difficult.
A key question that must be asked is: Does that country substantially
add to America's own economic and military capabilities without creating
significant new dangers or vulnerabilities? Only if that question can be
answered with an unequivocal "yes," should the country be considered a
beneficial ally. Otherwise, [it is either a useless or]{.underline}
(even worse) a [dangerous security client]{.underline}. [U.S. leaders
badly need to learn the difference]{.underline}. [As a result of NATO's
expanded membership and mission]{.underline}, [the United States has
acquired a worrisome number of both types]{.underline}.

European security order in shambles, further escalation must be

Moscow's Strategic Goals [Russia sees its security being threatened
above all by NATO's expansion]{.underline} to the east. Moscow already
demonstrated in 2014 that Ukraine has a key role to play in this. The
annexation of Crimea was less about "pro­tecting Russian compatriots"
than about securing the bases of the Black Sea Fleet. In the Donbas, by
contrast, the Kremlin, while strengthening the rebels, had been sticking
to the Minsk Agreement for the past eight years. Moscow had assumed that
the vic­torious Maidan movement would seek Ukraine's rapid accession to
NATO -- a goal that now has constitutional status. [Moscow is fixated on
the US as the lead­ing NATO power]{.underline}. [With it, Russia
maintains a nuclear strategic balance based on a mutually assured
destruction capability]{.underline}. It is anchored in bilateral arms
control trea­ties, most recently in the New Start Treaty, which both
sides extended by five years in February 2021. It limits the number of
those nuclear weapons and carriers with intercontinental range that can
be used to threaten targets in the territories of the two potential
adversaries from their own terri­tory or from submarines. The agreed
bal­ance is intended to guarantee the nuclear second-strike capability of
both sides and thus deter a strategic nuclear attack ("first strike").
[The agreed "strategic stability" has been threatened by recent
developments]{.underline}. [These include new delivery systems not
governed by the New Start Treaty]{.underline}, long-range con­ventional
precision and hypersonic weap­ons, strategic missile defense, and
anti-satellite weapons. [Both sides fear that the combined application
of this potential could undermine second-strike nuclear capabilities and
enable a disarming first strike]{.underline}. This is being discussed in
bilateral strategic stability talks. From Washington's perspective,
moreover, China's growing nuclear capabilities have altered the
strategic balance and the regional balance in the East Asia-Pacific
region. They challenge the "extended deter­rent" of the US that benefits
its East Asian allies. Washington therefore wants to engage Beijing in
arms control. With the US far from the theater of con­flict in Europe,
[Moscow finds itself at a dis­advantage]{.underline}, that is, it is
[facing additional security risks in Europe]{.underline}. [These include
the nuclear weapons of France and the UK]{.underline}, [as well as the
deployment of US sub-strategic nuclear weapons]{.underline} in Europe
[and NATO's conventional forces on Russia's borders]{.underline}. Moscow
also fears a future threat from new US intermediate-range weapons in
Europe. They could reach strategic targets in the European part of
Russia should Washington and NATO partners decide to deploy them.
[NATO's expansion has created more poten­tial deployment areas in Central
and Eastern Europe]{.underline}. **[For the Kremlin]{.underline}**,
therefore, **[NATO is primarily an instrument of the US to advance
geopolitical interests to the detri­ment of Russia's
security]{.underline}**. To this end, [according to Moscow]{.underline},
[the West had broken earlier agreements]{.underline} and now wants to
rem­edy this with new draft agreements. The West sees the drafts as an
attempt by Moscow to change the European security order. It counters
this by invoking the right of states to freely choose their alliances.
How­ever, European security arrangements are more complex. They also bind
alliances.

8\. Eurasian Orientation: [The Motive for a New Cold War]{.underline}
The collapse of the Soviet Union was a significant milestone in changing
the dominant pattern of the international system, and consequently,
changing the dominant attitude in Russia's foreign policy. Although [at
the beginning of the collapse of the Soviet Union]{.underline}, the
[prevailing view was to follow the hegemony]{.underline} and Russia
considered friendship with America and following Washington as its
nature and identity, [but when Putin got into power]{.underline}, the
pragmatic policy of Putin and, subsequently, [all attentions were
directed at Eurasian Orientation and]{.underline} the
[self-confidence]{.underline} created by the improving economic
conditions and the rising energy price [convinced Russia to redefine
itself and not only to avoid following the hegemony but oppose
it]{.underline} and restore the role and identity of the original Russia
to the land broken into pieces. With such as view and the presence of
theoreticians such as Dugin, [Russia's major concern was to define and
determine certain policies and perspectives based on Eurasianism and its
view of the region]{.underline}. Therefore, [after Russia became
relatively powerful]{.underline} and following the improved conditions
in this country, [its offensive policies expanded in the regional and at
the international level]{.underline}. There are two different views
about the change of the competition between America and Russia into the
Cold War:  According to one view, the competition between Russia and
America will not turn into another cold war. The reasons provided for
this claim are the signs of the relationship between the two countries
after the Cold War; their post-war relations has gone through a process
that is indicative of cooperation and interaction rather than
confrontation and competition despite the ups and downs. This [cold-war
approach to the relations between America and Russia pays little
attention to some of the global trends]{.underline} requiring the
development of regional cooperation, the need for a dynamic interaction
in the process of world economy and also the dominance and development
of liberal democracy values. Finally, it can be stated that [the
improved internal conditions and the rising price of the energy
resources created a self-confidence in Russian leaders for more serious
confrontation with the anti-Russia provocations in
Caucasus]{.underline}. [Extensive military intervention by Russia in
Southern Eurasia is]{.underline} not only [indicative of Russia's
geopolitical reappearance in Caucasus]{.underline} but [also a deterrent
strategy and a serious warning and threat to the regional countries to
reconsider their anti-Russian attitudes]{.underline} (Ebrahimi and
Mohammadi, 2011, 17).  However, with the emerging developments and
changes in Ukraine and Crimea\'s secession to Russia and America's and
Russia's interferences in the region supported the view that another
cold war is happening. The differences and conflicts between Russia and
Ukraine had a great impact upon the social status of the country members
of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Ukraine has the largest
population and the highest economic and political capacity in CIS after
Russia. Accordingly, it has always attracted the attention of Russia, on
the one hand, and the West, on the other. A part of their conflicts and
differences is concerned with determining the status of the Crimean
peninsula. This peninsula, which was separated from Russia and attached
to Ukraine during Khrushchev's run, has a special position and
significance in the Black Sea. The largest Soviet Navy is at the Port of
Sevastopol at the coast of the Black Sea. Furthermore, another aspect of
the differences and conflicts between the two countries is motivated by
economic issues. Ukraine claims to have a share in the Soviet assets
abroad, which Russians have taken over with the excuse that they are the
legal successor to the Soviet. [The relations between Russia and America
in the last years of Putin's presidency had a particular
quality]{.underline}. In this period, [taking an offensive pragmatist
approach]{.underline}, [Putin adopted the policy of "Direct
Resistance]{.underline}" against the expansionism of the West and,
particularly, America imperceptibly from 2006 and obviously from the
beginning of 2007 considering the self-confidence he had built up by the
achievements and successes in the political and military fields and
particularly the unexpected inflow of dollars from oil resources into
the Russian economy. [The point of departure for this
trend]{.underline}, which Derek Averre refers to as Putin's Munich
doctrine, [was his speech in Munich Security Conference in which he
severely criticized America's unilateral approach]{.underline} (Koulayi,
2007, 213). Russia is the heart of the Soviet Union and many of the
social and structural features of the Soviet can be seen in the
political and strategic foundations and components of this country. Its
[competition with the United States goes back to the 19th
century]{.underline}. These competitions were initially formed in the
framework of balance of power in the international policies. America and
the Soviet Union formed the bipolar international system from 1945 to
1991 and, currently, after the collapse of the former Soviet Union and
the end of the bipolar international system, [Russia has been still
following the strategic policies of those times and claims to be
fighting with the unipolar system]{.underline}. **[The most important
areas of conflict between Russia and America are the security
issues]{.underline}**. [Russia is totally opposed to the development of
NATO and the growing unilateralism being followed by the United States
and **always shows reactions to them**]{.underline}. The [examples of
this strategy]{.underline} and approach can be observed in its
disagreement with America's missile defense plan and criticism of
[America's]{.underline} strategic policy and intention to [withdraw from
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]{.underline} (Koulayi, 2007). [Russian
politicians believe that great powers need great enemies]{.underline}. A
superpower needs another superpower that stands against it. [The more
powerful and the greater the enemy is, naturally the more glorious it
will be to stand against]{.underline} it. Therefore, it is only America
which has the competence and capability to be an enemy to the United
States. Russia needs a totally new identity that can replace the
identity and ideology of the time of the Soviet Union. With this new
identity, Russia can determine its position in the world and among the
great powers. This country is defining itself in a new promised land.
[The Western model]{.underline}, which had been considered as a
desirable pattern for Russia at the beginning of Yeltsin's run, [has
faded into insignificance both from the Russian people's and
politicians' perspective]{.underline}. The Missile Defense Shield raised
some points with regard to the future and prospect of the relations
between Russia and America for the macro-level analysis. He first
referred to the existence of two trends of thought in Russia, i.e.,
Atlanticism (West-orientation) and Eurasianism. There are both extremist
and moderate groups within each thought trend. The West's sanctions,
which seemed totally inefficient at the beginning, is now having a very
negative effect on Russia's economy. Above all, the significant decline
in oil prices over the past few months, has greatly affected Russia
leading to a sharp drop in its export earnings and the value of Ruble.
Eastern Ukraine has also turned into a dangerous region for Russia at
the present time due to the killing of Russian soldiers involved in war.
In the same way, the West's disagreement with and even fear of Russia
has increased and European economic and political leaders have become
less inclined to makes investments in Russia and help Moscow and
cooperate with Putin (Katz, 2014). [The Ukraine crisis can also become
an excuse for intensive geopolitical competition between America and
Russia]{.underline} all over the world, but the commonalities such as
moderated nuclear weapons can increase the areas of cooperation between
the two countries. Otherwise, [if this competition is not moderated, it
can lead to a significant hidden competition in international
relations]{.underline}, [which influence many other issues]{.underline}.
Today, half of the Russian population believes that if we put aside and
ignore Russia's frustration in Afghanistan, during the former Soviet
Union, the international conditions have been more stable, reliable and
in favor of and to the advantage of Russia. Only 5% of the Russian
people believe Russia had a good position in the international arena
during Yeltsin's rule. [Russia needs a foreign enemy in order to find
and determine its direction]{.underline}. When Putin refers to enemy,
the Russian people realize that, if he does not mention the name of this
enemy, he is referring to the United States, which dropped with anger
the first nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, destroyed Vietnam with different
types of poison and, more importantly, has put in all its efforts to
destroy the glory of their native land, i.e., Russia. Russian people,
however, like Europe in contrast with the United States. According to
the Russian people, Europe is a praiseworthy entity that nobody is
definitely afraid of. 80% of the Russians believe in the existence of
positive and warm feelings between the Europeans and the Europe.
Nevertheless, Russians still credit their Asian origin. 50% of the
Russians do not consider themselves as European and believe that Russia
has never been European. This group of Russian people are proud of
Russian traditions and values. Europe and, particularly, European
countries are too small, in the Russians' eyes, to count as an enemy and
play the role of an enemy (Der Stürmer, 2011, 291). [Considering the
conflict with the West over the establishment of missile defense shield
and with the end of the period of building trust between the two
countries, Put wanted the West to reform its wrong behavior at the peak
of distrust between the two countries under "Moderate Eurasian
Orientation]{.underline}" despite the fact that he believed in creating
a balance between their view of and relations with the East the West.
[The relations with America has always had ups and downs in
Russia]{.underline}. However, these relations can be divided into two
periods: the first period started from the collapse of the Soviet Union
and continued until September 11th, 2001 and the second period started
with the attack on the twin towers of the World Trade and has continued
up to now. In the first period, the ideological competition between the
two countries had ended due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and
security policies and America's military doctrine, which was founded
upon opposition to and inhibition of communism, was intrigued by
strategic confusions and ambiguities, but America still views itself
superior to Russia considering the new unipolar structures. In the
second period, Putin's accession to power and the September 11th events
were two important factors that made the relations between America and
the Russian Federation step into a new stage. Putin had improved the
undesirable conditions in Russia to a large extent. On the one hand, he
showed a cooperative orientation towards fighting terrorism and , on the
other hand, exercised power within the country. But, overall, none of
the players could ignore the other side. Thus, the competition for
gaining more benefits and interests continued (Ebrahimi & Mohammadi,
2011, 8). Generally, [the measures taken by Russia in its new
confrontation with America and NATO include the following]{.underline}:
[The massive sale of weapons to the countries challenging America and
Europe]{.underline}, Carrying out a 200-billion project for [empowering
the Russian army]{.underline}, An attempt to establish the rule of
Russia over some regions of the North Pole, The [resumption of flights
of strategic bombers]{.underline} in distant areas, The suspension of
Russia\'s membership in the treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in
Europe, Expulsion of English diplomats from Russia, [Testing new
ballistic missiles]{.underline}, Suspension of cooperation with NATO
until further notice (Ebrahimi & Mohammadi, 2011, 16). Activation of
Russian diplomacy in the Middle East, encouraging the Middle East
governments to have security cooperation within the region in the
framework of Shanghai Organization instead of the models of mutual
military-security agreements with America and measuring its success,
[turning the Western]{.underline} (under the leadership of America) [and
Eastern]{.underline} (by facilitating a coordination between China and
Russia) [conflict into an identity conflict]{.underline}, and **[Putin's
clear disagreement over NATO's unilateral actions under the leadership
of America for solving the crises in Europe]{.underline}** and
particularly in Eastern Europe and the Balkans are all examples of these
measures. Despite that, it seems that the world is passing and moving to
a new plan of polarization. Russia's worry about its primary security
circuit increased with the West's and particularly NATO's increasing
presence after the September 11th events. America's intrusion into the
traditional area of influence of Russia in the middle of the 1990s
caused a threat to the Russian interests, but the peak of this
progressive movement by America was after the September 11th events.
After these events, the United States had direct presence in the region
deploying its forces to the bases in the regional countries. At this
time, Russians showed a passive reaction watching the growing presence
of the Americans in the Caucasus and the Central Area and were not very
pessimistic about this presence. After the initial shock of the initial
horrific events subsided and America's strategic goals for having
presence and establishing military bases and also creating and fomenting
color revolutions in the Central Asia countries and Caucasus as a direct
result of the issues were revealed, [Russians felt an looming threat and
their way of interaction with America greatly changed]{.underline}. They
used different strategies as a lever to challenge this country's (i.e.,
America's) desired order in the region and drive and force America away
from their geostrategic area. Among the strategies and reactions shown
by Russians were their [absolute rejection of America\'s plan to operate
a missile shield in Eastern Europe]{.underline}, considering the
preparation and establishment of new nuclear missile sites in Petersburg
and announcing the use of the fleet of long-range nuclear patrol
aircraft. These measures reached their peak by establishing the Shanghai
Treaty Organization. Shanghai Treaty was the result of America's
encroachment upon Russia's and China's geopolitical area bringing these
two countries together (MojtahedZadeh and RashidiNejad, 2011, 14). In
fact, [Russia's foreign policy in the Middle East as a country that
claims to be reviving its lost power]{.underline} in the international
arena can be evaluated and examined with respect to this claim and in
terms of its position towards the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, the
nuclear issue of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Syria, Palestine and the
countries experiencing Islamic awakening. On the whole, Russia has
always been opposed to America's presence in the Middle East both
overtly and covertly. This opposition has been much stronger
particularly when this presence has been along with military operation
or has not been approved and supported by the United Nations. Russia was
opposed to America's attack on Iraq from the very beginning such that
some experts talked about the likely veto of this plan by Russia in the
Security Council before America started the attack. Russia's measures
were, in fact, also the beginning for a new polarization after the Cold
War. In line with that, an opposing power is emerging and developing
against a power that seeks to establish a hegemonic order. The
anti-hegemony power is being formed with Russia's initiative. Although
Russia is not as powerful as America, the polarization trend against
America can, at least, create a challenge for the power of America
(Talebi Arani, 2007, 23). Based on the mentioned principles, Putin
believed in lack of confrontation and gaining advantage until the
threshold of tolerance topples. An evidence for this is Russia's support
for the war in Afghanistan, the initial not-so-serious oppositions to
the war in Iraq and lack of serious disagreement and opposition to the
military cooperation between America and Georgia (Harutyunyan, 2007,
11). By replacing the concept of "multilateralism" with the concept of
"multipolar system", Putin made an attempt to replace the components of
competition and tension in the idea of multipolar system with the
components of competition and cooperation in the concept of
multilateralism. In the concept of multilateralism, Russia defined a
positive role for itself in the cooperation with the West and even
America and considered itself as an international strategic arrangements
partner particularly in the security issues (Koulayi, 2010, 217-219).
Taking the Eurasian Orientation policy by Russia and standing against
America instead of following and complying with it, has had different
effects on Russia and its status in the area of international relations
and at different regional levels. In addition, at the internal level it
led to gaining trust and the promotion of the position of Putin inside
Russia and introduced him as a national hero and the symbol of powerful
and modern Russia and saving Russia from the mire of problems and
establishing its position in the international system became a major
strategic goal. Furthermore, [Russia offensive stances in the
international arena has created internal solidarity and with the change
of Russia's policy from 'following' and Atlanticism to Eurasian
Orientation]{.underline} has helped to resolve Russia's identity issues
to some extent. Therefore[, it seems that offensive policy and the
Eurasian Orientation are directly related]{.underline}. There is also a
positive and a negative view of the Eurasian Orientation policy at the
regional level. According to the positive view, Russia can justify some
of its interferences in some of the policies of the regional countries
that are related to America and justify them in the framework of its
confrontation with America. But, on the other hand, this can have
negative consequences such that some of the regional countries feel
insecure due to Russia's interferences in their affairs which,
accordingly, can cause some conflicts at the regional level leading to
the weakening and decline of Russia. However, [the new policy taken by
Russia]{.underline}, i.e., Eurasian Orientation, in the framework of the
offensive realism theory, which originates from Putin's doctrine and has
anti-American symbols, has had [different consequences for Russia's
reputation in the international arena]{.underline}. First, this policy
challenged the unipolar system and America-centeredness and introduced
Russia as a powerful player against America. This claim is raised in
framework of the multipolar system theory. Second, the existence of such
a phenomenon is indicative of the fact that America is not an eternal
great power and the appearance of another polar may challenge the nature
of hegemony. Third, [challenging America at the international level is
the cause of importance of Russia in the region]{.underline} and, in
fact, from the perspective of the enemies of America, Russia is their
hero and supporter in the international decision-makings. This attitude
has also posed a challenge to the order desired by the United States in
the sensitive and critical regions. In addition to the regional
countries, Russia considers the presence and enmity of any other power
as an obstacle and threat to its security and interests. As a result,
[fighting America and preventing the development of NATO in the region
originates from Russia Eurasian Orientation]{.underline} and,
consequently, [indicative of its offensive approach that tries to nip
any feeling of insecurity in the bud]{.underline}. The collapse of the
Soviet Union, in fact, changed the conditions in the international
system making America a hegemony that rules over the world and spares no
effort to keep and preserve the status quo. In contrast, Russia is still
thinking of realizing its old dream, i.e., gaining control over the
whole world or at least, at the present time, domination and control
over Europe and Asia. Therefore, it is not content with the existing
situation can use the domino of attaching the regional countries such as
Crimea to Russia to realize this dream.

[Russia has launched an unprecedented act of aggression against
Ukraine]{.underline}. [The United States and its allies must respond
forcefully]{.underline}. But as they do, [they should take into account
the possibility of triggering a spiral of escalation that could lead to
the only outcome worse than the invasion of Ukraine itself: a hot war
between Russia and NATO]{.underline}. Neither Russia nor NATO wants to
go to war with the other. But [history is rife with examples of states
ending up in a war without initially having intended to
fight]{.underline}, as well as cases of [smaller conflicts sparking
broader wars]{.underline}. And the [circumstances of the Russian
invasion create particularly significant escalation risks]{.underline}.
Russia has launched the largest military operation in Europe in at least
a generation in a country that borders four NATO allies on
land---Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania---and shares a maritime
boundary with another---Turkey. With major operations now ramping up,
[the risk of an accident, such as a Russian military aircraft straying
into NATO airspace while conducting combat operations, has
grown]{.underline}. Russian cruise missiles have reportedly already hit
targets close enough to the Polish border to set off sirens on the other
side. A targeting error leading to a strike on NATO territory is far
more plausible in the fog of war. [The Russian armed forces, now
conducting a near-existential struggle, could misinterpret NATO
efforts---completely justified under the circumstances---to reinforce
frontline allies as an attempt to mount an intervention against them in
Ukraine, and might well respond accordingly]{.underline}. [If its
nuclear forces are really now on a higher alert status]{.underline}, as
President Vladimir Putin claims, [further guardrails against rapid
escalation have been lowered]{.underline}. Ongoing efforts to help the
Ukrainians resist Russia\'s aggression run risks as well. There were
reports this week that Ukrainian pilots were to travel to Poland to
retrieve gifted Soviet-made jets and fly them back to the fight. Once it
became public, the plan set off alarm bells, and was quickly scrapped.
But the understandable desire to help---and fast---will persist, and
could lead to other similarly risky ideas. [Russia\'s war in Ukraine, in
short, raises the risks of an accident, incident, or miscalculation that
spirals into a NATO-Russia war]{.underline}. [The paranoid nature of
Putin]{.underline}\'s personalistic, autocratic regime [further
complicates matters]{.underline}. There is little question that he sees
the sanctions as part of a campaign to overthrow his government. Fear
that such a campaign is ramping up could lead him to retaliate directly.
Russian cyber attacks against Western financial institutions could
create pressure in the West to escalate, adding to the spiral. Concern
about escalation should not stop the West from responding forcefully to
Russia\'s actions. But steps can be taken that might mitigate the risks.
First, the U.S. and NATO military chiefs should maintain the channels of
communication they have with their Russian counterparts. While many
existing consultative mechanisms with Moscow have rightly been severed,
these links are essential to avoid miscalculation. Second, during the
phase of active Russian combat operations, these channels could be used
to provide additional transparency---so long as doing so does not
undermine operational security---about the nature of U.S. and NATO force
movements to the allied states bordering Ukraine. [It is in U.S. and
allied interests that the Russian military]{.underline}, at a time when
it is operating under extreme pressure, [not be surprised by NATO
activity]{.underline} and misinterpret a deployment to an ally as an
intervention in Ukraine. Third, the West could leverage some sanctions
to push Putin to abandon his core war aim of decapitating the Ukrainian
government and installing a pro-Russian puppet. Using relief of the
central bank sanctions, for example, to compel a cease-fire and a
negotiated settlement would not only minimize human suffering in
Ukraine, it could also signal the limits of Western intentions, making
clear the sanctions are not about overthrowing Putin\'s regime. Fourth,
assistance to the Ukrainian military should be coordinated among allies,
carefully calibrated, and conducted outside public view. U.S. and allied
military leaders should factor in escalation concerns when deciding what
to deliver and how to deliver it. [This will be an extremely difficult
needle to thread]{.underline}, but it is essential. Putin has led his
country into an unprovoked, murderous war with its neighbor. As the West
imposes costs, it should do so in a way that avoids a broader war that
would cause even more death and destruction.

#### **Putin responds harshly to expansion of military infrastructure.**

LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - President Vladimir [Putin said]{.underline}
on Monday that [there was no threat to Russia if Sweden and Finland
joined NATO]{.underline} but [cautioned that Moscow would respond if the
U.S.-led alliance bolstered military infrastructure]{.underline} in the
new Nordic members. [Putin]{.underline}, Russia\'s paramount leader
since 1999, has [repeatedly cited the post-Soviet enlargement of the
NATO alliance eastwards toward Russia\'s borders as a reason for the
conflict of Ukraine]{.underline}. But Putin, who has in recent months
rattled Russia\'s nuclear sabre at the West over Ukraine, made an
unusually calm response to Finland and Sweden\'s bids to join NATO, the
biggest strategic consequence of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine to date.
[read more]{.underline} \"[As to enlargement, Russia has no problem with
these states - none]{.underline}. And so in this sense there is no
immediate threat to Russia from an expansion (of NATO) to include these
countries,\" Putin told the leaders of a Russian-dominated military
alliance of former Soviet states. [Putin]{.underline}, though, l[aced
his newly found tranquillity on NATO with a warning. \"But the expansion
of military infrastructure into this territory would certainly provoke
our response]{.underline},\" Putin said. \"[What that (response) will
be - we will see what threats are created for us,]{.underline}\" Putin
told the leaders of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO),
which includes Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
The Kremlin chief\'s remarkably serene response to one of Russia\'s most
sensitive geopolitical worries - the post-Soviet enlargement of NATO -
contrasted to some tougher language from his foreign ministry and senior
allies. Before Putin spoke, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei
Ryabkov said [the West should have no illusions that Moscow would simply
put up with the Nordic expansion of NATO]{.underline}. Those comments
were still being played up on state television. One of Putin\'s closest
allies, former President Dmitry Medvedev, said last month that [Russia
could deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in the Russian
exclave of Kaliningrad if Finland and Sweden joined NATO]{.underline}.

Putin read a short speech that touched on NATO and scolded the United
States for creating biological laboratories in the former Soviet Union.
Putin said Russia had evidence that the United States had been trying to
create components of biological weapons in Ukraine, a claim Washington
and Kyiv have denied. Besides NATO\'s \"endless expansion policy\",
[Putin said the alliance was reaching far beyond its Euro-Atlantic
remit]{.underline} - a trend he said that Russia was following
carefully. [Moscow says NATO threatens Russia and that Washington has
repeatedly ignored the Kremlin\'s concerns about the security of its
borders in the West]{.underline}, the source of two devastating European
invasions in 1812 and 1941. Putin says the \"special military
operation\" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using
Ukraine to threaten Russia through NATO enlargement and Moscow had to
defend against the persecution of Russian-speaking people. [Putin says
assurances were given as the Soviet Union collapsed that the alliance
would not expand eastwards toward Russia]{.underline}, a promise he says
was a lie. The United States and NATO dispute that such assurances were
given explicitly. Kyiv and its Western backers say the claim of
persecution of Russian speakers has been exaggerated by Moscow into a
pretext for an unprovoked war against a sovereign state. The West says
NATO - an alliance of 30 countries including former Warsaw Pact
republics such as Poland and Hungary as well as nuclear powers such as
the United States, Britain and France - is purely defensive.

#### NATO existence trades off with united Europe\-\-- stability is [impossible]{.underline}.

confrontation',"

The Russian President wrote in the German newspaper Die Zeit to mark 80
years since the Nazi\'s invaded the Soviet Union. While saying Russia
wants to foster relations with a \"united\" Europe, Mr [Putin attacked
NATO as a \"relic of the Cold War]{.underline}\". NATO , also the North
Atlantic Alliance, is a military union between 30 European and North
American countries that implements the North Atlantic Treaty, signed on
April 4, 1949. Mr [Putin claimed NATO has dashed any hopes of a united
Europe]{.underline}, and stated [the body was \"created for
confrontation]{.underline}\". Referencing NATO\'s expansion, he said:
\"We hoped that the end of the Cold War would be a common victory for
Europe. \"But a different approach has prevailed based on the expansion
of NATO, a relic of the Cold War. \"Since 1999 there have been five more
\"waves\" of NATO expansion, 14 other states joined the alliance,
including former Soviet republics, which de facto dashed all hopes for a
continent without dividing lines.\" Referencing efforts to embrace
countries like Ukraine, Mr Putin added [NATO is responsible for
increasing tensions on the continent]{.underline}. He wrote: \"[The
whole system of European security has now degraded
significantly]{.underline}. \"[Tensions are rising]{.underline}, and the
[risks of a new arms race are becoming real]{.underline}. \"We simply
cannot afford to carry the burden of past misunderstandings, hard
feelings, conflicts, and mistakes. \"Our common and indisputable goal is
to ensure security on the continent without dividing lines, a common
space for equitable cooperation and inclusive development for the
prosperity of Europe and the world as a whole.\" The Russian President
also argued [many European countries are faced with an \"ultimatum\" to
work with Moscow or the West]{.underline}. Mr Putin sensationally
claimed the US and other Western countries \"aggressive policy\" led to
the 2014 Ukraine revolution, which resulted in Russia annexing Crimea.
The Ukrainian crisis was sparked when President Viktor Yanukovych
suspended preparations for greater integration within the EU, leading to
mass protests, in an effort to maintain economic ties to Moscow. In his
opinion piece, Mr Putin argued the US\'s actions in the Ukraine and the
EU states support of the protestors led to the annexation of the Crimea
from the Ukrainian state. It comes after Mr Putin attended a summit with
US President Joe Biden earlier in June. Speaking after the summit, the
Russian President said Mr Biden \"doesn\'t miss anything\" and informed
reporters the talks were productive. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov
said [Moscow expected the US to keep trying to \"contain\"
Russia,]{.underline} and added: \"The \[Russian\] president\'s words
about the constructive mood during the summit do not indicate that we
have moved away from a sober assessment of our bilateral relations with
the United States. \"Pragmatism and sobriety are most important in these
relations. And both suggest that the constructive, positive results of
the summit absolutely do not indicate that the United States will
abandon its policy of containing Russia.\" The US and other NATO
countries were enraged by Russia\'s build-up of troops on the border of
Ukraine earlier this year. Moscow deployed two armies and three airborne
formations to border Ukraine, claiming it was part of readiness drills
that would continue for two weeks. Russia\'s defence minister Sergei
Shoigu also said at the time [Moscow\'s exercise was provoked
by]{.underline} what he said were efforts by [the US and its NATO
allies]{.underline} to beef up their forces near Russia\'s borders,
\"threatening\" Russia. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg described the
deployment as \"unjustified, unexplained and deeply concerning\".

#### NATO is a cold war relic in Russia.

Nataliya **Vasilyeva 06-22**-22 \[Russian Correspondent, The Telegraph,
"Vladimir Putin uses 80th anniversary of Nazi invasion to lash out at
Nato,"
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/06/22/vladimir-putin-uses-80th-anniversary-nazi-invasion-lash-nato///ZW\]

Vladimir [Putin]{.underline}, the Russian president, has [used the
anniversary of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union to lash out at
Nato's expansion]{.underline} in Europe in a clear message to Ukraine.
The Russian leader, in an opinion piece published by Germany's Die Zeit
newspaper on Tuesday, exactly 80 years after Nazi troops invaded the
Soviet Union, [criticised the expansion of Nato as threatening Russia's
security and fostering "Cold War-era dividing lines]{.underline}" in
Europe. Moscow has been rattled by the fact that former Soviet allies
such as Poland and even ex-Soviet republics including Latvia have become
members of the Euro-Atlantic military alliance since the fall of the
Soviet Union. Mr Putin lauded Europeans for putting their differences
aside after the end of the Second World War and [expressed his
frustration with what he saw as the West's attempts to contain
Russia]{.underline}. Mr Putin's article came out the day after Armin
Laschet, the frontrunner to become Germany's next chancellor, gave an
interview to the Financial Times calling on the West to "establish a
sensible relationship with Russia" and praised Joe Biden, the US
President, for reaching out to Mr Putin. [Russia's increasingly
aggressive foreign policy]{.underline}, which culminated in the
annexation of Ukraine's Crimea in 2014 and the Kremlin's support for
separatists in eastern Ukraine, [has damaged ties between Russia and the
EU]{.underline}. However, Mr [Putin blamed Nato's westward expansion as
"the main reason behind a surge in mutual distrust in
Europe]{.underline}". Russia amassed an unusually high number of troops
at the border with Ukraine this spring, which was seen as a threat of
invasion, but Moscow said it was a response to Nato's military drills in
Europe. Ukraine, which has lost more than 14,000 people in the armed
conflict in the country's east, has been pressing the West for a
timeline for its possible accession to Nato, seeing it as the only way
to ward off Russian aggression. Mr Putin struck a conciliatory note,
apparently inspired by his meeting with Mr Biden in Geneva last week
when the two leaders agreed to focus on the few areas of cooperation
including arms control that they share to overcome the crisis in their
relationship. Mr [Putin insisted that security and economic growth in
Europe is possible only if all European nations including
Russia]{.underline} - which he described as a country that shares "a
close cultural and historic bond with Europe" - [pull
together]{.underline}. \"Russia stands for restoring a comprehensive
partnership with Europe\... and we can\'t afford to keep on dragging the
baggage of frustrations, conflicts and mistakes with us," he said. "I\'m
convinced we all have to admit our mistakes and rectify them.\" Despite
coronavirus restrictions, Mr Putin on Tuesday led a ceremony at the Tomb
of the Unknown Soldier by the Kremlin wall to honour the memory of the
fallen in the war which killed 27 million people in the Soviet Union.

### AT: Black Sea\-\--2NC

#### NATO's black sea presence is hollow \-\-- doesn't fool Russia, assure allies, or constrain behavior \-\-- but Turkey won't rock the boat and there's no scenario for tensions emerging 

**Istomin 20** \[Igor Istomin, "Stepping Up NATO\'s Presence in the
Black Sea Region: Causes and Consequences," Jan 21, 2020,
https://valdaiclub.com/a/highlights/stepping-up-nato-s-presence-in-the-black-sea/\]

Returning to the general situation in the Black Sea region, it is worth
emphasising once again that **[NATO's build-up of military activity is
largely symbolic and]{.underline}** in essence **[does not change the
balance of power]{.underline}**. In military and political terms, the
key change in the strategic situation in the region came in 2014: the
entry of Crimea into the Russian Federation, among other things,
provided an additional impetus for modernisation and the build-up of
Russian forces on the peninsula. The geographical location of Crimea
itself provides Moscow with a fairly comfortable position in terms of
ensuring the military aspects of national security in the Black Sea. In
this regard, [there is no real reason to reassess Romania's attempts to
stimulate some kind of NATO activity on the southern flank]{.underline}.

An important circumstance, which also corresponds to Russian interests
in the Black Sea, is the increased independence of
[Ankara]{.underline}'s position. Despite the fact that the latter
remains a member of NATO, it [has distanced itself from the Western
allies, especially after the attempted military coup]{.underline} in
2016. Despite the fact that the partnership between Russia and Turkey is
saddled with a number of serious contradictions, **[for Ankara it is not
advantageous to aggravate relations with Moscow in a situation where it
sees in the Euro-Atlantic partners as almost the main
threat]{.underline}** to its political regime.

In the current conditions, **[it is difficult to count on the resumption
of the plans for the development of Black Sea cooperation]{.underline}**
that were born in the 2000s, but the risks of the bloc confrontation
spreading in this region should not be overestimated.

#### Lack of NATO and EU coherence blunts effectiveness of deterrence and undermines credibility -- US presence is destabilizing, and Russia doesn't have an incentive to stop meddling.

policy discord,\"
<https://www.mei.edu/publications/black-sea-region-politics-and-policy-discord>
//bdom\]

I have the good fortune of living in the Baltics and working in the
Black Sea region. Compared to the positive NATO effort in the Baltics,
[[the **Black Sea**]{.mark} region as an operational space **[is
a]{.mark} dangerous [conceptual mess for]{.mark}** both [**NATO** and
the **EU**.]{.mark} A **[lack of clarity]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
purpose [**[confuses countries]{.mark}** in the region [that]{.mark}
really [need support]{.mark}]{.underline} in their fight against Russian
interference. [**Neither organization** appears to have **clear regional
policies**.]{.underline} They certainly do not have any apparent
coordination or even perhaps realistic plans. An added challenge is that
the [**[US is driving ideas]{.mark}** and organizational change
regionally much [faster than]{.mark} the NATO Black Sea [allies can
follow]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby [[**unbalancing** the]{.mark}
**political military [equation]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This confusion
makes things worse for Ukraine and Georgia.

There is no question as to the threat facing the region: Russia, Russia,
Russia. Former US European Army Commander General Ben Hodges summarizes
the problem well in an article in War on the Rocks calling the Black Sea
the "'launching pad' for destabilizing operations in Syria and naval
operations in the Eastern Mediterranean. [[Only a **foolish** pundit
would suggest **Russia will stop meddling**]{.mark} further]{.underline}
in the Mediterranean [**[after]{.mark}** relative [success in **Syria
and** increased deployments into **Libya**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
President Vladimir [Putin will happily increase the numbers of African
refugees]{.underline} heading to Europe, an act that former SACEUR
General Philip Breedlove called weaponizing immigration to destabilize
European cohesion. In the popular Russian newspaper Argument Weekly,
Serhii [Riazonov, a deputy from the Samara Duma and United Russia party,
stressed the importance of the Black Sea to Russia]{.underline}. He also
drew the conclusion from the recent announcement by NATO of Enhanced
Cooperation Partnership for Ukraine that it was not designed to benefit
Ukraine, but rather that NATO's real aim was to secure Ukrainian troops
to fight inside Russia. This sort of comment should force NATO and EU
planners to sit up and realize that they must concentrate seriously on
warfighting in the region, rather than relying on deterrence. [After
all, [**without a credible** warfighting **capability, deterrence is
undermined**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Russia is today using the sea as a major theater of war against Ukraine.
The Black and Azov Seas are maritime lifelines for Ukraine, allowing it
to ship steel and agricultural products to the world. Russia squeezes
Ukraine by controlling shipping through the Kerch Strait into the Sea of
Azov. Vessels flying NATO and EU member state flags are also affected
but these countries are allowing Russia to act with impunity. This both
encourages Russia to risk more against them, and gives a clear
impression that what she does to Ukraine is politically allowed. Russia
has stolen gas rigs on the Black Sea shelf belonging to Ukraine. Most
significantly, Crimea is now militarized and serves not only as a
stepping-stone into Ukraine, but also as a missile base threatening not
only Black Sea countries but much of Europe as well.

The challenge is that [[the **Black Sea**]{.underline}]{.mark}, like the
Baltic Sea, [[has **no joint commander**]{.mark} for peace and
war]{.underline} --- someone who is [focused on thinking about
countering Russian challenges in the region. **[Nor are there]{.mark}**
suitably [placed]{.mark} and focused **[regional joint
headquarters]{.mark}**]{.underline} for either the EU or NATO. NATO must
create a supreme allied commander (SAC) for both regions --- a SACBaltic
and SACBlack Sea. The current absence of allied commanders has severe
consequences. For the EU, [having [no]{.mark} military [commander means
a total **abrogation** of]{.mark} the **[collective
responsibility]{.mark}** for defending its eastern border and for
developing a]{.underline} political, or at some point even a military,
[response to the costly and humiliating shipping problem.]{.underline}
The EU today relies totally on sporadic and uncoordinated responses from
NATO or individual countries to manage Russian aggression.

There are some EU military programs. Germany provides framework nation
divisional support to Romania, while France and Germany are cooperating
with other nations in Eurocorps. This soothes the EU, German, and French
consciences. In reality, collecting small tactical groupings together
may do plenty for the interoperability of those who take part. However,
in terms of preparing for warfighting, the constant 'penny-packeting'
and regular rotation of forces has little benefit for the overall
security of the Black Sea or Baltic regions. Arguably, it merely wastes
precious resources. The lack of a full-time NATO regional commander in
peace and war leaves the US as the primary buffer, responsible, by
default, for leading multilateral and bilateral activities. The likely
move of a US Stryker brigade into Romania unbalances this equation even
more. It diverts NATO and national focus away from the need to improve
national contributions both here and likely in Bulgaria also.

Responses from Germany and France do not help. As the two major European
military powers on the continent, they benefit from the strong
likelihood that their territory will not be invaded by Russia. But their
activities against Russia are muddled. Both countries have provided
tactical contributions to NATO forces in the Baltics and both are
engaged through the Eurocorps with countries in the Black Sea region.
But they must develop a more strategic warfighting answer against
Russian aggression --- tactical responses will only bring grief. As a
Baltic country, Germany --- which is creating a NATO 2-star Generals
command in Rostock --- should arguably focus north. France with her vast
and recent operational experience should direct her attention eastwards
toward the Black Sea, bringing NATO and EU contributions into some sort
of operational alignment.

[Another **key challenge** in the Black Sea region is that [countries
affected]{.mark} by Russia [are offering **individual**]{.mark}
**tactical [solutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- not just in terms of
activity, cooperation, and mini-alliances, but also in terms of defense
organizations and procurement. [[This **limits**]{.mark} Black Sea
[operational **coherence**]{.mark}. National]{.underline} development
[plans are **dominated by national** political and defense
**ambitions**]{.underline} that are at best coordinated with NATO
through administrative processes, but almost never with the EU.
[[Countries]{.mark} certainly [do not co-ordinate]{.mark} with their
neighbors --- [relationships]{.mark} that in some cases [are on frosty
terms outside of NATO]{.mark} exercises.]{.underline} Planning
departments within defense ministries are often overwhelmed by the
combination of NATO programs, NATO requirements, EU programs, Allied
operations, UN operations, bilateral programs, and multinational
programs, not to mention grand national procurement ambitions. US
support is welcomed and needed, but [the cost of having an [**in-country
US presence** and dealing with]{.mark} US [gifts or defense sales
is]{.mark} often completely **[destabilizing]{.mark}** for defense
budgets.]{.underline} Most countries still retain ageing Soviet style
administrations and lingering Soviet-type officer corps. They lack the
human capacity to negotiate complex budget and programming dynamics, not
to mention shifting priorities.

[[The]{.mark} regional [approach today]{.mark} is "**strategy
light**."]{.underline} Responding to Russian, and increasingly
unexpected Turkish actions, [**[assumes]{.mark}** that [deterrence
happens through **ad-hoc exercises**]{.mark} and activities.
[This]{.mark} **systemic [incoherence]{.mark}** [does not]{.mark} help
solve, or even [improve]{.mark}, the [weak]{.mark} and discordant
political [responses]{.mark} of Ukraine. [Diplomatic efforts]{.mark} by
NATO and EU countries]{.underline} in Kyiv (and likely Tbilisi also)
[[are **devoid of overall unity**]{.mark} aimed a common
goal.]{.underline} It is little wonder defense issues do not take higher
priority in domestic political debates.

Without operational guidance, every Black Sea state is attempting to
solve commonly shared problems on their own. Ukraine remains highly
vulnerable to Russia with an all-but-non-existent navy and is completely
overshadowed by the Russian Black Sea fleet. The US has provided small
ships, but Ukraine has no weapons of substance to take aboard, let alone
a modern targeting capability. Ukraine's political and senior military
leadership appears increasingly pacifist, seemingly encouraged by
European diplomats to be that way. NATO has provided regular support
with exercises and port visits, especially from 6th Fleet. The US has
taken the Ukraine-Russia situation more seriously than most, providing
support with missile ships and training, and recently even air cover
from Italy and Romania. UK is now also increasing training support. But
from a regional defense and Ukrainian perspective, support still appears
sporadic and uncoordinated.

[With limited operational focus against Russia, it is unclear what NATO
forces such as the 6th Fleet should do when they arrive in the Black Sea
region. The program appears to be a public relations exercise, rather
than having clear strategy.]{.underline} Progress in regional
operational capability is not linear. [**[Regional activities]{.mark}**
organized by NATO]{.underline}, as well as multilateral and bilateral
activities, [are [lauded]{.mark} by participants [as
deterrence]{.mark}.]{.underline} While some do strengthen warfighting
ability, [they [are **less successful**]{.mark} in directly challenging
the activities of Russia]{.underline}. Operational dysfunctionality
within the EU and NATO continues, helped only in part with improvements
to US regional support. [[The **US** flag has]{.mark} had **[no]{.mark}
visible [deterrent]{.mark}** [effect]{.mark} on Russian
ambitions.]{.underline} Pressure on Donbass, Azov, Moldova, and Georgia
strengthens while Russian attempts to pull Turkey into its orbit
continue, further confusing the situation.

[The [lack of]{.mark} clear [NATO]{.mark} political and operational
[guidance]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Black Sea [[leaves]{.mark}
countries with **[incoherent and]{.mark}** usually [**unbalanced
development** plans]{.mark} for individual forces]{.underline}. They are
at odds over priorities and how their limited budgets should be spent.
The NATO mantra is to treat members and partners as "sovereign nations."
They all seek to develop expensive gold standard systems but with
seemingly no grasp of cost or often relevance. As Gen. Hodges noted
"NATO needs a joint, three-star command in the Black Sea region \...
where they wake up every morning smelling Black Sea air \... and can
maintain an \'unblinking eye\' on the region. \... Speed of recognition
of RUS activity is essential to deterrence \... and coord ops".

#### Defense of the Black Sea isn't credible, and countries veto proposals to bulk up presence.

[The [**differing** and]{.mark} sometimes [**divergent interests**
of]{.mark} countries in the [Black Sea region make it **difficult to
frame** a unified]{.mark}, sustainable **Western [strategy]{.mark}** [to
protect]{.mark} common [interests and counter]{.mark} malign
[Russian]{.mark} influence and intimidation. [**Romania** is
looking]{.mark} more to what is happening [to the
**north**]{.mark}]{.underline} and northeast in Ukraine and Moldova,
while [**[Bulgaria]{.mark}** is more concerned about developments [to
the **south**]{.mark}, including what is happening in Turkey, migration
from Syria, and a resurgence of the radical Islamist
threat.]{.underline} Nevertheless, most participants agreed at a
conceptual level on the importance of crafting and implementing a
coherent common strategy, even though there was limited agreement on
what the actual elements of such a strategy should be.

[[The main impediment]{.mark} to defense cooperation among states in the
region [is the **lack of a common threat
perception**]{.mark}]{.underline} similar to the one the Baltic and
other northern European states share. For example, [**[Bulgaria]{.mark}
was [not supportive]{.mark}** [o]{.mark}f the Romanian
proposal]{.underline} in the run-up to the 2016 Warsaw Summit [to
[expand NATO naval exercises]{.mark} in the Black Sea.]{.underline} For
its part, [[**Turkey** **insists** on]{.mark} maintaining [the
**status** **quo**]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}, acting as if it
is still Russia's peer in the naval power. In contrast, [Ukraine and
Georgia are more acutely concerned about the Russian
threat]{.underline}, welcomed the Romanian proposal, and support
Romania's advocacy of an increased NATO military presence and expanded
regional defense cooperation. Thus, the policy preferences of these two
NATO partners (Ukraine and Georgia) are more aligned than are the
stances of the three allies (Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey) in the
region.

Furthermore, [even as the Baltics and Poland have benefited from a
relatively broad EU and NATO acceptance of the looming Russian threat to
northern Europe, [key **EU and**]{.mark} European [**NATO** governments
**show little interest** in Black Sea security]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Several participants argued that the United Kingdom, France, and Germany
are more focused on current policy crises such as Brexit, migration, and
stabilizing conflict areas in the Middle East and Africa than on the
concerns of southeastern European countries.

This [[lack of a common]{.mark} threat [perception translates in]{.mark}
NATO [force levels]{.mark} in the Black Sea region that most
participants felt are [**inadequate** for a **credible
deterrence**]{.mark}.]{.underline} NATO's tailored forward [**[presence
is]{.mark} quite [limited]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} the more **capable**
[European **governments seem uninterested**]{.mark} in contributing
troops to the multinational brigade in Romania or augmenting the NATO
maritime presence]{.underline}; the U.S. military presence in Romania is
largely a bilateral arrangement.

[The lack of common threat perception also stems from the **divergent
views among Western European nations** as to whether the Black Sea
region is an integral part of Europe and the European Union or is merely
in the EU's "neighborhood."]{.underline} Those governments that see the
Black Sea region as part of Europe and the EU support policies that
promote stability, prosperity, and security in the region, while those
that view the region as being only in the "neighborhood" focus on
policies limited to stability and avoid pushing back on provocative
Russian activities. The latter approach could actually promote
long-lasting instability in the region by encouraging Russian
assertiveness and outright aggression.

[[Another hurdle]{.mark} to achieving a common Western strategy
[concerns]{.mark} the East-West divide in military
capabilities.]{.underline} Most of the [[former **Eastern Bloc
countries**]{.mark} in the Black Sea area [have **dated military
equipment**]{.mark} with capabilities that are [**not on a par**
with]{.mark} those of [Western]{.mark} NATO

#### No impact \-\-- Black Sea tensions only risk escalating if Ukraine tries to coerce the US into opposing Russia \-\-- strategic restraint prevents escalation 

**Carpenter 18** \[Ted Carpenter, CATO, "Ukraine Doesn't Deserve
America's Blind Support," Nov 28, 2018\]

In reality, the Kerch Strait incident involves a complex mixture of
factors. They include the tense Russian‐​Ukrainian bilateral
relationship, Kiev's broader foreign policy objectives, and Ukraine's
volatile domestic politics.

Ukrainian President Petro [Poroshenko had to know that a decision to
send three naval vessels through the Kerch Strait would be
disruptive]{.underline}. The strait, which connects the Black Sea and
the Sea of Azov, separates Russia's Taman Peninsula from the Crimea
Peninsula. Despite Moscow's annexation of the latter in 2014, Kiev still
considers Crimea to be Ukrainian territory, a position that the United
States and its allies back emphatically. Moreover, passage through the
strait is the only oceanic link between Ukraine's Black Sea ports and
those on the Azov. Kiev, not surprisingly, views the strait as
international waters. Russia, however, regards the waterway as its own
territorial waters and viewed the attempted transit by the three
Ukrainian ships as a violation.

Whatever the legal merits of the competing positions regarding
sovereignty over Crimea and the status of the Kerch Strait, [the reality
is that Russia controls that peninsula and is unlikely to ever restore
it to Ukraine]{.underline}, despite Western demands. [Poroshenko had to
know that his attempt to send warships through a narrow passage between
what the Kremlin insists are two portions of Russian territory was
certain to cause an incident. **Why did Kiev risk**]{.underline} ([if
not avidly seek]{.underline}) **[such a confrontation]{.underline}**?
And why now? There are several likely motives.

[Kiev wants to **increase pressure on NATO**, and especially the United
States, to take a **harder stance against Moscow**. Despite their
official position that the Kremlin must disgorge Crimea]{.underline} and
end support for pro‐​Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, Western
policy looks increasingly stale and ineffectual. Some European officials
even muse that it may be time to reconsider (weaken) the economic
sanctions that the West imposed on Russia. President Trump has stated
that Russia should be re‐​admitted to the G-7 group of leading economic
powers.

Such talk is potentially quite threatening to Ukraine's interests.
Creating an incident that reminds Kiev's Western supporters (and the
rest of the world) of Moscow's aggressive tendencies makes any prospect
of even a limited rapprochement between Russia and either NATO or the
European Union less likely.

Ukrainian leaders are especially determined to nurture greater bilateral
strategic cooperation with the United States. The notion that the Trump
administration has pursued a "soft" policy toward Russia, much less one
that amounts to appeasement, has always been overstated. Trump's
initiatives are actually more hardline than those Barack Obama's
administration embraced. That is especially true regarding Washington's
relationship with Kiev. Whereas Obama consistently refused to provide
weapons to Ukraine, the Trump administration has approved two major arms
sales, one of which included sophisticated anti‐​tank missiles. U.S.
troops have participated in joint military exercises with Ukrainian
forces, and Secretary of Defense James Mattis concedes that the United
States is training Ukrainian units at a base in western Ukraine.

Poroshenko and his associates want to encourage and intensify those
trends. They hope that creating a new incident underscoring aggressive
Russian conduct will lead the Trump administration to boost arms sales
and other forms of bilateral military cooperation. Even if Trump proved
reluctant to adopt that course, domestic and international pressure
might leave him little choice. Indeed, Western news media outlets
excoriated Trump for not immediately condemning Russia as an outright
aggressor in the Kerch Strait incident.

Poroshenko thus has ample foreign policy reasons for taking the actions
he did in the Kerch Strait. He also has significant political and
ideological incentives. His government did not announce the official
date for Ukraine's 2019 presidential election until two days following
the naval clash; it is now set for March 31. To say that the timing of
the announcement was suspicious is an understatement.

No candidate in the extremely crowded field is likely to exceed the 50
percent mark needed to avoid a runoff, but recent surveys have indicated
that Poroshenko is in surprisingly poor political shape. Most polls
showed him receiving between 8 and 15 percent of the first‐​round vote.
The leading candidate is former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, with
Poroshenko running in third. Corruption scandals continue to bedevil his
administration, making his re‐​election (or even his ability to make the
runoff) far from certain.

In addition to creating a "rally around the flag" effect, thereby
boosting Poroshenko's status, Russian seizure of the Ukrainian vessels
gave the president a justification to impose outright martial law in 10
regions of eastern Ukraine---areas likely to be especially hostile to
his political prospects. It could also serve as a basis for tightening
Ukraine's already worrisome restrictions on freedom of expression.

That track record should trouble Kiev's backers in the West. [To wage
war against eastern separatists, Kiev early on not only instituted
military conscription, it arrested critics of that action.]{.underline}
Authorities jailed television journalist and blogger Ruslan Kotsaba and
charged him with treason for making a video denouncing the conscription
law. Kotsaba become Amnesty International's first "prisoner of
conscience" in Ukraine since the 2014 so‐​called Maidan revolution.

The vagueness of the applicable laws (and the absence of any meaningful
independent review or right of appeal) has been especially alarming.
Indeed, it seems that anyone who disputes the government's account of
the Maidan revolution (especially those who dare to mention the role of
ultranationalist, neo‐​fascist elements) or the conflict in eastern
Ukraine is likely to be silenced.

Bogdan Ovcharuk, a spokesperson for Amnesty International's Kiev office,
expressed the concerns of many proponents of freedom of expression when
he told the BBC: "This is a very slippery slope indeed. It's one thing
to restrict access to texts advocating violence, but in general banning
books because their authors have views deemed unacceptable to
politicians in Kiev...is deeply dangerous." The consequences of such a
campaign, he warned, were certain to damage the fabric of liberty.

Yet **[the Kiev government's restrictive policies continue
unabated]{.underline}**. In September 2015, Ukrainian authorities issued
an order banning 34 journalists and seven bloggers from even entering
the country. The Committee to Protect Journalists reported that the
newly publicized list was merely part of a larger blacklist that
contained the names of 388 individuals and more than a hundred
organizations that were barred from entry on the grounds of "national
security" and allegedly posing a threat to Ukraine's "territorial
integrity."

Human Rights Watch criticized the Kiev government in September 2017 for
imposing yet more restrictions on journalists, especially foreign
correspondents. The Poroshenko government even pushed through
legislation barring criticism of Ukraine's past, including the role that
ultra‐​nationalist guerilla leader (and Nazi collaborator) Stepan Bandera
and his followers played in World War II. Censorship provisions and
other media restrictions may become even more widespread and arbitrary
with Poroshenko's new declaration of martial law.

**[Ukraine's Western admirers typically ignore such evidence of
authoritarian conduct]{.underline}**, [since it does not fit with their
portrayal of the country as an enlightened member of the democratic
community]{.underline}. The reality is that **[Ukraine
epitomizes]{.underline}** what CNN analyst Fareed Zakaria has aptly
described as an "**[illiberal democracy]{.underline}**." The Poroshenko
regime certainly does not warrant unquestioned Western backing**[. Kiev
is not above engaging in provocations to serve either its political
leadership's domestic agenda or its foreign policy
objectives]{.underline}**. **[The United States does not have vital
strategic or moral interests at stake in the overall Ukraine‐​Russia
quarrel, much less the latest parochial spat in the Kerch
Strait]{.underline}**. A [cautious, restrained posture is
appropriate]{.underline}.

### AT: Ukraine\-\--2NC

#### Expansion of NATO contributed to the war in Ukraine.

Thomas L. **Friedman** 02-21-**2022** \[Foreign Affairs Op-Ed Columnist,
The New York Times, "This is Putin's War. But America and NATO Aren't
Innocent Bystanders,"
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/21/opinion/putin-ukraine-nato.html//ZW\]

When a major conflict like Ukraine breaks out, journalists always ask
themselves: "Where should I station myself?" Kyiv? Moscow? Munich?
Washington? In this case, my answer is none of these. The only place to
be for understanding this war is inside Russian President Vladimir
Putin's head. [Putin is the most powerful, unchecked Russian leader
since Stalin]{.underline}, and [the timing of this war is a product of
his ambitions, strategies and grievances]{.underline}. But, with all of
that said, [America is not entirely innocent of fueling his
fires]{.underline}. How so? Putin views Ukraine's ambition to leave his
sphere of influence as both a strategic loss and a personal and national
humiliation. In his speech on Monday, Putin literally said Ukraine has
no claim to independence, but is instead an integral part of Russia ---
its people are "connected with us by blood, family ties." Which is why
Putin's onslaught against Ukraine's freely elected government feels like
the geopolitical equivalent of an honor killing. Putin is basically
saying to Ukrainians ([more]{.underline} of whom want to join the
European Union than NATO): "You fell in love with the wrong guy. You
will not run off with either NATO or the E.U. And if I have to club your
government to death and drag you back home, I will." This is ugly,
visceral stuff. Nevertheless, [there is a back story here that is
relevant]{.underline}. [Putin's attachment to Ukraine is not just
mystical nationalism]{.underline}. In my view, [there are two huge logs
fueling this fire]{.underline}. [The first log was the ill-considered
decision by the U.S. in the 1990s to expand NATO after]{.underline} ---
*indeed, despite ---* [the collapse of the Soviet Union]{.underline}.
[And the second and far bigger log is how Putin cynically exploited
NATO's expansion closer to Russia's borders to rally Russians to his
side to cover for his huge failure of leadership]{.underline}. Putin has
utterly failed to build Russia into an economic model that would
actually attract its neighbors, not repel them, and inspire its most
talented people to want to stay, not get in line for visas to the West.
[We need to look at both of these logs]{.underline}. [Most Americans
paid scant attention to the expansion of NATO in the late
1990s]{.underline} and early 2000s [to countries in Eastern and Central
Europe]{.underline} like Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia, [all of which had been part of the former Soviet
Union or its sphere of influence]{.underline}. It was no mystery why
these nations would want to be part of an alliance that obligated the
U.S. to come to their defense in the event of an attack by Russia, the
rump successor to the Soviet Union. [The mystery was why the
U.S.]{.underline} --- which throughout the Cold War dreamed that Russia
might one day have a democratic revolution and a leader who, however
haltingly, would try to make Russia into a democracy and join the West
--- [would choose to quickly push NATO into Russia's face when it was
weak]{.underline}. A very small group of officials and policy wonks at
that time, myself included, asked that same question, but we were
drowned out. The most important, and sole, voice at the top of the
Clinton administration asking that question was none other than the
defense secretary, Bill Perry. Recalling that moment years later, Perry
in 2016 told a conference of The Guardian newspaper: "[In the last few
years, most of the blame can be pointed at the actions that Putin has
taken. But in the early years I have to say that the United States
deserves much of the blame]{.underline}. [Our first action that really
set us off in a bad direction was when NATO started to
expand]{.underline}, bringing in Eastern European nations, some of them
bordering Russia. "At that time, we were working closely with Russia and
they were beginning to get used to the idea that NATO could be a friend
rather than an enemy ... [but they were very uncomfortable about having
NATO right up on their border]{.underline} and they [made a strong
appeal for us not to go ahead with that]{.underline}." On May 2, 1998,
immediately after the Senate ratified NATO expansion, I called George
Kennan, the architect of America's successful containment of the Soviet
Union. Having joined the State Department in 1926 and served as U.S.
ambassador to Moscow in 1952, Kennan was arguably America's greatest
expert on Russia. Though 94 at the time and frail of voice, he was sharp
of mind when I asked for his opinion of NATO expansion. I am going to
share Kennan's whole answer: "I think [it is the beginning of a new cold
war]{.underline}. I think the [Russians will gradually react quite
adversely and it will affect their policie]{.underline}s. I think it is
a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was
threatening anybody else. This expansion would make the founding fathers
of this country turn over in their graves. "We have signed up to protect
a whole series of countries, even though we have neither the resources
nor the intention to do so in any serious way. \[NATO expansion\] was
simply a lighthearted action by a Senate that has no real interest in
foreign affairs. What bothers me is how superficial and ill informed the
whole Senate debate was. I was particularly bothered by the references
to Russia as a country dying to attack Western Europe. "Don't people
understand? Our differences in the Cold War were with the Soviet
Communist regime. And now we are turning our backs on the very people
who mounted the greatest bloodless revolution in history to remove that
Soviet regime. And Russia's democracy is as far advanced, if not
farther, as any of these countries we've just signed up to defend from
Russia. Of course there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and
then \[the NATO expanders\] will say that we always told you that is how
the Russians are --- but this is just wrong." It's EXACTLY what has
happened. To be sure, post-Cold War Russia evolving into a liberal
system --- the way post-World War II Germany and Japan did --- was
hardly a sure thing. Indeed, given Russia's scant experience with
democracy, it was a long shot. But some of us then thought it was a long
shot worth trying, because even a less-than-democratic Russia --- if it
had been included rather than excluded from a new European security
order --- might have had much less interest or incentive in menacing its
neighbors. Of course, none of this justifies Putin's dismemberment of
Ukraine. [During Putin's first two terms as president]{.underline} ---
from 2000 to 2008 --- [he occasionally grumbled about NATO expansion but
did little more]{.underline}. Oil prices were high then, as was Putin's
domestic popularity, because he was presiding over the soaring growth of
Russian personal incomes after a decade of painful restructuring and
impoverishment following the collapse of communism. [But across the last
decade]{.underline}, as Russia's economy stagnated, [Putin]{.underline}
either [had to]{.underline} go for deeper economic reforms, which might
have weakened his top-down control, or [double down on his corrupt crony
capitalist kleptocracy]{.underline}. He chose the latter, explained Leon
Aron, a Russia expert at the American Enterprise Institute and the
author of "Yeltsin: A Revolutionary Life," who is now writing a book
about the future of Putin's Russia. And to both cover and distract from
that choice, [Putin shifted the basis of his popularity from "being the
distributor of Russia's newfound wealth and an economic reformer to the
defender of the motherland]{.underline}," Aron said. And right when
Putin opted for domestic political reasons to become a nationalist
avenger and a permanent "wartime president," as Aron put it, what was
waiting there for him to grasp onto was the most emotive threat to rally
the Russian people behind him: "The low-hanging fruit of NATO
expansion." And he has dined out on it ever since, even though he knows
that NATO has no plans to expand to include Ukraine. [Countries and
leaders usually react to humiliation in one of two ways --- aggression
or introspection]{.underline}. After China experienced what it called a
"century of humiliation" from the West, it responded under Deng Xiaoping
by essentially saying: "We'll show you. We'll beat you at your own
game." [When Putin felt humiliated by the West after the collapse of the
Soviet Union and the expansion of NATO]{.underline}, he responded: "I'll
show you. I'll beat up Ukraine." Yes, it's all more complicated than
that, but my point is this: This is Putin's war. He's a bad leader for
Russia and its neighbors. But America and NATO are not just innocent
bystanders in his evolution.

#### Failure in Ukraine has made Putin a loose-cannon.

Making Putin More Dangerous,"
https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-fears-russia-failures-in-ukraine-making-putin-more-dangerous/6498217.html//ZW\]

WASHINGTON --- [Senior Western officials are increasingly alarmed that
Russia\'s losses in Ukraine are making President Vladimir Putin more
dangerous]{.underline}, some going as far as to compare him to [a caged
animal ready to lash out]{.underline}. The warnings, from Washington and
Brussels, come as new intelligence estimates suggest that up to 20% of
Russian troops sent into Ukraine have been killed, wounded or captured
as Ukraine fights Moscow to a near standstill. \"I don\'t know if you
can go as far \[as to say\] stalemate, but it\'s clear that after one
month, Russia has achieved almost none of their strategic objectives,\"
said a senior NATO official, who spoke to reporters Wednesday on the
condition of anonymity in order to discuss intelligence. \"They are
stalled in Kyiv. They are stalled in Kharkiv. They are stalled in
Chernihiv,\" the official said. And in a break with some U.S. defense
officials, who have declined to talk about Russian casualties in Ukraine
because of "low confidence" in the estimates, NATO officials say the
price on the battlefield has been high. NATO on Wednesday estimated that
between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in battle,
basing the assessment on intelligence from Ukraine and its own
observations, including information accidentally released by Moscow.
When wounded, captured and missing soldiers are factored in, the number
of Russian troops taken off the battlefield is between 30,000 and
40,000, the alliance believes. [But Western officials warn that rather
than pull back, Putin has decided to respond to failure with even
greater brutality and tactics reminiscent of a previous
era]{.underline}. \"They are achieving more results in the south, but
the price of it is absolutely horrendous,\" the senior NATO official
said, accusing Moscow of trying to carpet-bomb the Ukrainian city of
Mariupol into submission. \"What they do is World War II, 70-year-old
techniques,\" the official said. \"[To reach this extreme, you need to
be cornered and you need to be pushed to break all moral human rules to
go to such brutality]{.underline}.\" The official further warned that
[Russia\'s failure to quickly subjugate Ukraine is feeding into Putin\'s
already deep hatred of Western values]{.underline}, [increasing the
chances he may choose to expand the conflict beyond
Ukraine]{.underline}. \"The alliance is absolutely at risk,\" the
official said. [There is growing concern that Putin may turn to weapons
of mass destruction, whether they be nuclear, chemical or
biological]{.underline}. \"Russia must stop its nuclear saber rattling.
This is dangerous and it is irresponsible,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens
Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels Wednesday, ahead of an
extraordinary meeting of alliance heads of state. \"[Any use of nuclear
weapons will fundamentally change the nature of the
conflict]{.underline},\" Stoltenberg said. \"NATO is there to protect
and defend all allies, and we convey a very clear message to Russia that
nuclear war cannot be won and should never be fought.\" [Putin put
Russia\'s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert]{.underline} just
three days after Russian tanks first rolled into Ukraine, and some
Russian officials have floated the idea of using tactical nuclear
weapons if necessary. \"If it is an existential threat for our country,
then it can be used in accordance with our concept,\" Kremlin spokesman
Dmitry Peskov told the U.S.-based cable news channel CNN on Tuesday.
U.S. defense officials said earlier this week that so far, they had seen
no movement by Russia that would cause them to change Washington\'s own
nuclear deterrence posture. But the U.S. has expressed growing concern
about the possibility Russia will use chemical weapons. \"I think it\'s
a real threat,\" U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters Wednesday in
Washington before leaving the White House to attend the NATO summit in
Brussels. While not downplaying the danger, a senior U.S. defense
official cautioned Wednesday that, at this point, a Russian attack using
chemical or biological weapons does not appear to be looming. "We
haven\'t seen any imminent signs that there\'s going to be a chem-bio
\[chemical or biological\] event caused by the Russians," the official
told reporters, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss
sensitive information. [NATO officials]{.underline}, however, [said the
alliance has reason to believe an eventual attack is not out of the
question]{.underline} and that they are preparing for two equally
frightening scenarios. \"One is what is openly called a false flag
operation --- this would be an accident on a chemical plant,\" the
senior NATO official said, pointing to the large amounts of ammonia,
nitrates and other agricultural chemicals in Ukraine. \"If you have a
massive release of those agents, it is very dangerous for the
population,\" the official added, warning that chemical clouds could
then put other countries in the region at risk. But NATO is also worried
Russia could throw caution to the wind and use missiles or shells to
target Ukraine with highly lethal neurotoxins. \"When you use them, they
are so characteristic that the attribution is immediate,\" the official
said, adding that the biggest question for Western defense officials is
whether Russia is going to want to stay below the threshold of
attribution for the weapons it unleashes.

Eleven: [Hype Escalates Conflict]{.underline} [Government]{.underline},
military and industry [leaders are consequently able to make wild claims
without providing evidence]{.underline}. [This has an escalatory
effect]{.underline}. 'We\'re in a pre-9/11 moment, in some respects,
[with cyber]{.underline},' said John Carlin, assistant attorney general
for national security in the Justice Department in Aspen, Colorado in
July.^25^ He did not provide concrete details to back up his claim. Just
weeks after Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014, NATO\'s Supreme Allied
Commander Europe (SACEUR), USAF General Philip Breedlove, made comments
about Russia\'s use of cyber in doing so. He told the *New York Times*
that cyber-warfare had been used to isolate the Ukrainian military on
the Crimean peninsula.^26^ A month later he revisited these claims,
stating that cyber was a critical part of Russia\'s actions. To quote
Breedlove:^27^ When they \[Russia\] took Crimea, cyber was a part of a
well-planned, total decapitation of Crimea from the command and control
structure of Ukraine. Ukraine was absolutely disconnected from being
able to do anything with their forces in that area. Cyber was one of
three tools used, and used quite exquisitely. Consequently, [the
Atlantic Alliance is updating its cyber-defence policy]{.underline} -- a
point confirmed at the recent NATO summit in Wales. A very serious
cyberattack, some in the Atlantic Alliance seem to suggest, should be
treated like an invasion. 'For the first time we state explicitly that
the cyber-realm is covered by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, the
collective defence clause', said Jamie Shea, NATO\'s deputy assistant
secretary general for emerging security challenges, in June.^28^ [At
first glance]{.underline}, [this]{.underline} statement [appears to be
meant as a deterrent]{.underline}. [However, deterrence does not seem to
apply]{.underline}: to deter, a statement needs to be clear and backed
by credible threat of punishment. So far, [NATO is doing the
reverse]{.underline}: 'We do not say in exactly which circumstances or
what the threshold of the attack has to be to trigger a collective NATO
response,' Shea said, 'and we do not say what that collective NATO
response should be'.^29^ [A vague but high bar for cyber-attacks also
implicitly legitimises ongoing espionage attacks]{.underline} as
acceptable and minor. Moreover, [the vast majority of cyber-attacks also
do not fall into NATO\'s remit in the first place]{.underline}:
[espionage and cyber-crime are problems for intelligence agencies and
law enforcement, not for a military alliance]{.underline}. [For
militants and the Kremlin, the subtext is clear: cyber matters; better
up your game]{.underline}. NATO -- among others -- is escalating a
problem that *someone else* will have to solve.

Cold War, implications for today,"
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2019.1631811//ZW\]

Implications for the future Building on the findings from the Cold War
cases, this section examines how [emerging technologies such
as]{.underline} precision, stealth, remote sensing, [cyber]{.underline},
and other forms of electronic warfare [might influence intra-war
escalation risks today]{.underline}.^48^ The analysis suggests that
[emerging technologies could]{.underline} under some circumstances
contribute [to the perception of first-mover advantages, potentially
generating inadvertent pressures for]{.underline} conventional or even
[nuclear escalation]{.underline}, as in the first causal chain. Overall,
however, this danger seems unlikely to arise spontaneously as a function
of technology alone. Rather, [technology seems likely to be an
intervening variable that could enable or accelerate escalatory
pressures originating elsewhere]{.underline}, particularly in state
policies or military doctrines that intentionally seek to manipulate
escalatory risk. This possibility, outlined in the second causal chain,
does not mean that concerns about new technologies are unwarranted, but
it does suggest that the causal role of technology may be weaker than
often claimed. [The digital networks on which great power militaries
increasingly rely represent one of the most worrisome current
developments]{.underline}.^49^ Now usually referred to as
'[cyber]{.underline},' these [capabilities]{.underline} reflect a long
line of developments in electronic warfare that [are powerful in their
own right but also support other important capabilities such as
precision and remote sensing]{.underline}. [In combination, these
developments could in the future prompt inadvertent intra-war
escalation]{.underline} because of the advantages that would accrue to
the side that prevented its adversary from using these networks as early
as possible in a war. [The heart of the issue is that states such as
Russia]{.underline}, China, [and the United States increasingly have or
will have the ability to precisely target or operate weapons systems
from ever-longer distances,]{.underline} e.g., missiles that can attack
targets over the horizon (OTH), or integrated air defense systems (IADS)
that can detect incoming aircraft long before they reach their intended
targets. [The most efficient way to counter these threats is to rapidly
destroy or disable the]{.underline} C2 [networks and related
assets]{.underline} that enable them to operate, which was the basic
premise of the much-criticized US Air-Sea Battle concept.^50^ The
potential danger is that the sort of extended range engagement
envisioned by Air-Sea Battle or similar concepts might unavoidably
expand the geographic scope of warfare -- a form of horizontal
escalation. [It also could raise risks of vertical escalation in the
nuclear or conventional domains]{.underline}, as efforts to limit an
adversary's long-distance strike capability might also hinder the
adversary's other conventional capabilities or even its nuclear force.
For example, in a future US-China conflict, the United States is very
likely to want to attack the radars, bases, launch sites, and C2
networks that enable China to precisely launch missiles within and
beyond the first island chain, even if the conflict begins well away
from mainland China, over Taiwan or in the East or South China Seas.^51^
The earlier in the war the United States attacks China's long-range
strike capability, the better off it will be, especially given that
China would likely be trying to conduct reciprocal attacks on US
capabilities. Of course, China's anticipation of this dynamic only
further incentivizes it to launch as much as it can as early as it can.
A war at sea could thus quickly become a war on land, potentially even
raising risks of nuclear escalation if the US starts to erode
capabilities relevant to China's nuclear arsenal -- simply because of
improvements in long-range conventional precision targeting on both
sides.^52^ The United States could face a similar situation with respect
to potential adversary air defenses. Imagine that the United States was
seeking to roll back Russian aggression in the Baltics. As Russian air
defenses are able to track and target US aircraft at increasing
distances, US incentives to destroy key nodes in the Russian IADS as
early as possible in a war will increase -- even though those nodes are
likely to be located in Russia (including the enclave of
Kaliningrad).^53^ The United States may face the difficult choice of not
controlling the airspace above an ally it is trying to defend, or
expanding the conventional war to include attacks on Russian
territory.^54^ The former would be suicidal, but the latter would be
highly escalatory. Moreover, t[he United States will likely feel
pressure to take such steps as early as possible in the war, on the
assumption that Russia will be engaged in a reciprocal effort to disable
US networks]{.underline}. [Even if Russia did not then escalate to the
use of nuclear weapons in response to attacks on its territory, Russia
might launch attacks on NATO]{.underline} member states or on major NATO
military assets [that it might otherwise have avoided]{.underline}.^55^
Of course, [US efforts to destroy Russian ground-based radars relevant
to Russian air defenses also could deny the Russians early warning of
potential attacks on their nuclear forces]{.underline}. This situation
[could heighten pressures for Russian nuclear escalation as
well]{.underline}.^56^ Nevertheless, these sorts of actions by
themselves would be unlikely to lead automatically to nuclear escalatory
pressure on adversaries, as the stronger claims about technology would
have it. In the future, as in the Cold War, other variables, such as the
presence of broader, deliberately developed US counterforce
capabilities, would be necessary as well. In the face of well-documented
US advances in precision, remote sensing, and computing, adversaries'
confidence in the security of their residual nuclear forces is likely to
decline substantially, rendering the potential nuclear implications of
conventional attacks much more worrisome. [As US capabilities continue
to improve]{.underline} -- and in particular as satellite imaging using
synthetic aperture radar enables the United States to better track
land-based mobile targets, including transporter erector launchers, with
increasing accuracy and over wider swaths of territory -- this
[insecurity on the part of adversaries is likely to
grow]{.underline}.^57^ [Improved US counterforce technologies also could
intensify pressures on adversaries to pursue destabilizing new
conventional capabilities that could then have their own inadvertent
escalation implications]{.underline}. For example, [if countries such as
China or Russia anticipate that the United States might use space-based
assets]{.underline} to conduct a counterforce campaign in the midst of a
conventional war, [those countries will have stronger incentives to
develop anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons.]{.underline} Adversaries'
acquisition of those capabilities [could in turn generate pressure back
on the United States to conduct any conventional attacks reliant on
space-based assets]{.underline} -- even those having nothing to do with
counterforce -- as early as possible in a conflict.^58^ [The result
could be a war with much greater prospects for vertical escalation even
below the nuclear threshold]{.underline}. These inadvertent dangers
notwithstanding, [great powers could use any of the technologies just
discussed to pursue intentional escalation as well]{.underline}. For
example, states could deliberately leverage the ability to short circuit
adversary C2 networks and/or to degrade adversary nuclear capabilities
as a means of coercion in wartime. [States might believe that by
conducting conventional military operations in ways that have these
additional effects, they could force their adversaries to capitulate
more rapidly than otherwise would be the case]{.underline}. Moreover,
**[they might believe that the prospect of such leverage could convince
opponents not to initiate conflict in the first place]{.underline}**.
This sort of thinking may in fact have undergirded aspects of the US Air
Sea Battle concept. Indeed, it is telling that the United States has
embraced more escalatory and expansive concepts for conventional warfare
despite the availability of alternative concepts that might stand a
better chance of keeping conflict limited.^59^ Similarly, China and
[Russia could structure their military forces in ways that reduced the
linkages between conventional and nuclear forces]{.underline}, but they
both seem to be doing the opposite. For example, despite a recent force
reorganization that afforded opportunities to better separate its
nuclear and conventional missile forces, China continues to intertwine
them, including developing a new missile that likely can carry both
conventional and nuclear warheads.^60^ Likewise, Russia continues to
station air defense assets in Kaliningrad.^61^ All three states seem to
be making efforts, both technological and otherwise, to convince
opponents that there is no 'safe' way to fight a conventional war
against a state with nuclear weapons. This behavior again casts
technology as more of an intervening enabler than an independent driver
of escalatory danger. If the past is any guide, then, emerging
conventional technologies could make future inadvertent intra-war
escalation more likely in cases where technologies create the perception
of first-mover advantages. However, past cases also demonstrate that new
technology often merely enables intentional escalation that states would
undertake in some other form even in the absence of technology, in which
case technology should not be considered the key driver of escalatory
behavior. It may be necessary for escalation in some instances, but far
from sufficient, and in some cases it is likely to be neither necessary
nor sufficient. Rather, the strategic and political contexts in which
new technologies are adopted would be most pivotal, and even the same
technology could have quite different implications for escalation
depending on these factors and the stakes involved. This finding does
not mean that concern about new technologies is unwarranted but does
imply that controlling or limiting technology will not necessarily
control or limit escalation.

SCENARIO 2: [Internal legitimacy crisis of the regime]{.underline} This
might [involve the initiation of a "small victorious war" for national
consolidation purposes]{.underline} or come as a result of a deepening
internal political [or economic crisis]{.underline}. Yet, [the depth of
the internal crisis which would force Russia to attack NATO would need
to be enormous to make it an appealing option]{.underline}. With regards
to the manufacturing of a "small victorious war", Russian history (and

For two decades, [Putin had sought to reverse the Western drift of
Kyiv]{.underline}, particularly the eastern extension of NATO, and [most
recently demanded the demilitarization and the so-called
"de-Nazification" of Ukraine]{.underline}.66 For Moscow, the latter
meant removing the role of Ukrainian nationalists. He threatened war if
the Zelensky government did not yield, but the youthful and previously
untested Ukrainian leader stood firm, despite the hundreds of thousands
of Russian troops assembled on the border in February 2022. [Putin, an
aging, increasingly isolated, and angry totalitarian ruler]{.underline},
unleashed a military assault on the Ukrainian democratic state. The
initial twin goals of a coup and installing a compliant puppet regime
failed. Subsequently, Putin opted for a slower and more brutal
three-pronged invasion campaign from the North, East, and South.
Increasingly, the aggressive Russian battle plan has targeted the
Ukrainian civilian population with massive artillery and aerial
bombardments, cutting off electricity, fuel, and food. It is a war of
aggression and involves war crimes against civilians. It even put at
grave risk Europe's largest nuclear power station and raised the
nightmarish spectre of a continental environmental disaster. [His
bellicose threat of nuclear weapons escalation is chilling]{.underline}.
Putin's initial territorial goals included expanding the strategic
Crimean naval outpost of Sevastopol that dominates the northern shores
of the Black Sea, re-asserting full military control over the Sea of
Azov, and providing land bridges east to Russia and west to
Transnistria, the breakaway Russian-dominated Moldovan state. In so
doing, Putin sought to reduce Ukraine to a landlocked and increasingly
vulnerable regime. It seems his "real-politik" aim was at least to
bifurcate Ukraine into two halves, divided by the Dnipro/Dnieper River.
In so doing, Putin would greatly expand upon his Donetsk and Luhansk
puppet states. Ultimately, if he cannot control Ukraine or at least turn
it into an unarmed, neutral buffer state, it seems he would prefer to
make it a wasteland. Echoing Stalin in the 1940s, [Putin seems to have
set his sights on establishing a new Russian bloc]{.underline}, ranging
from Belarus in the North to Crimea and Abkhazia in the South. In a
challenge and response international relations dynamic, NATO has been
re-energized, re-unified, and re-armed. Germany's geo-political posture
towards the East reoriented and military expenditures greatly increased.
Ironically, Putin has fostered a stronger and more determined adversary.
There is a growing gulf and increasingly polarized military divide
between the US-led NATO countries in the West and Moscow and its
satellite states in the East. [It seems like the beginning of a new Cold
War or even a "clash of civilizations]{.underline},"67 [if we do not
rapidly escalate into a hot war, either by design or by
accident]{.underline}.68 It seems the "Bloodlands" of Europe continue to
be a focus of inter-state rivalry, tensions, and conflict.

include]{.underline} the rise of a powerful internal opposition movement
or regional irredentism, a major concentration of forces or [a
qualitative upgrade of NATO offensive potential directed at
Russia]{.underline}, [or the perceived emergence of a direct challenge
to Russian command and control or nuclear deterrence
potential]{.underline}. [A Russian siege mentality and the level of
paranoia of the leadership, fuelled by memories of Kosovo and
Libya]{.underline} and strengthened by a selective information feed,
[could play a role in forming a picture of an inevitable
conflict]{.underline} and [push Russian leaders towards "preventive"
action]{.underline}. The conditions for reaching such a conclusion would
however be extreme. It would probably come only after the leadership
concluded that other measures for countering Western advances have been
exhausted.

approach they describe as an "escalate to de-escalate" or "[escalate to

about the prospect of Russian territorial aggression against a NATO

### AT: Deterrence/NATO Readiness Solves\-\--2NC

#### Increasing NATO readiness causes inadvertant escalation.

Leadership Network. Previously, he worked as the Head of the

Stability," https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/resrep17437.pdf//ZW\]

SCENARIO 3: [Inadvertent conflict]{.underline} This may be the [most
likely scenario for]{.underline} the breakout of [conflict]{.underline}.
The probability of an inadvertent conflict is [greatly
increased]{.underline} not only [by]{.underline} the close proximity of
Russian and NATO forces, but also by the fact that [Russia and NATO have
been adapting their military postures towards early
reaction]{.underline}, thus [making rapid escalation more likely to
happen]{.underline}. There are multiple ways in which both sides can
misread or misjudge the developments and actions of the other side
during a crisis. [This may be made more likely by the high level of
mistrust and also the fear of losing a confrontation]{.underline}.
R[ussia might be afraid of the internal consequences of a display of
weakness]{.underline} and loss of face if it backed down during a
crisis. [For NATO, a perception that it was outsmarted by Russia because
it did not show enough resolve could have fateful consequences for the
future of the Alliance]{.underline}. That in itself is likely to stiffen
NATO's resolve. While [NATO]{.underline} might be more willing to pause
and re-assess the situation, it [would be under severe pressure from
some Allies]{.underline}, and also its military commanders, [to
increase]{.underline} the [readiness]{.underline} of its forward
deployed forces and move reinforcements in before Russia denies NATO
such an option. "There are multiple ways in which both sides can misread
or misjudge the actions of the other side during a crisis." Also, while
Russia and to an increasing extent NATO are trying to coordinate
cross-domain actions for maximum effect, [the dynamics of cross-domain
escalation will be difficult to control]{.underline}. Thus, caught in an
action-reaction dynamic to which they have contributed but are not able
to control, [the sides could decide to move to the level of a military
conflict]{.underline}. Even more worryingly, [such a passage from crisis
to conflict might be sparked by the actions of regional actors or
military commanders at local levels]{.underline} or [come as a
consequence of an unexpected incident]{.underline} or accident As a
consequence, [both sides can]{.underline}, [in the "fog" of a crisis,
end up attributing more malign intentions to limited or inadvertent
actions]{.underline} by the opponent, assuming the opponents' goals to
be more extensive than they appear, and extending their own objectives
as the crisis expands.

[Inadvertent escalation cannot be deterred]{.underline} (though the
actions that could lead to it might be), [because it is not the result
of decisionmakers]{.underline} choosing to escalate [but]{.underline},
rather, [failing to realize that there is a choice to be
made.]{.underline} Thus, [to reduce the risk of inadvertent
escalation]{.underline}, [the adversary does]{.underline} not [need to
be]{.underline} frightened but, instead, [enlightened]{.underline}---
or, more accurately, it must first be enlightened, after which
deterrence may or may not still be required, depending on whether the
action still holds appeal once its escalatory potential is made clear.
[Several factors make this more problematic in practice]{.underline}
than it may appear at first glance, however. One is that an [inadvertent
escalation risk may not be recognized in advance by any party in a
conflict]{.underline}. In 1950, the United States did not recognize the
likelihood that China would intervene in Korea if UN forces continued
advancing north; but Beijing, which had tried, too subtly as it turned
out, to communicate its intention to enter the war, did not realize that
the situation was not understood in Washington. In 1914, no one other
than the German army could have explained to Chancellor Theobald von
Bethmann-Hollweg that mobilizing to invade France meant that its troops
would march into Belgium. In other cases, no one at all on either side
may realize that a course of action (COA) is potentially escalatory
until it is carried out, especially if it is a less-than-obvious
possibility beforehand. Another common obstacle to such strategic
explanation is that [it may appear to be risky to announce or
acknowledge one's political or military vulnerabilities]{.underline}. It
was a relatively straightforward matter for a U.S. political scientist
to warn that conventional war in Europe might leave the Soviet Union
vulnerable to a nuclear first strike to a degree that could make Moscow
dangerously insecure. However, it would have been unthinkable for Soviet
leaders to make the same suggestion. Given these challenges, [minimizing
the risks of inadvertent escalation as a result both of one's own
actions and those of the adversary potentially involves several
elements]{.underline}. One is [working to recognize in advance the paths
by which inadvertent escalation might occur]{.underline} in a particular
situation, which depends on collecting and, especially, analyzing
intelligence about the adversary's capabilities and possible behavior,
as well as analyzing one's own possible actions with attention to their
potentially escalatory effects. [Another is sensitizing leaders,
strategists, and planners to the possibility and nature of inadvertent
escalation in general]{.underline} and its potential risks in specific
contingencies so that they will take these considerations into account
when making decisions and plans. Finally, [there is the problem of
warning adversaries about inadvertent escalation risks they may not have
recognized]{.underline}.

[Conflict termination]{.underline} [Russian and NATO assumptions
regarding conflict termination would most likely not survive the first
hours of an actual conflict]{.underline}. [Both sides are capable of
underestimating the resolve of the other]{.underline} side to prevail in
a conflict and the other side's willingness to commit the necessary
resources and endure the costs, [especially once both sides start
committing their political capital and resources and the casualties
accumulate]{.underline}. "Russian and NATO assumptions regarding
conflict termination would most likely not surivive the first hours of
an actual conflict." With regards to Russia, [Moscow would most likely
be approaching the conflict with a clearer concept of its war aims and
thus develop better-formed views on conflict termination]{.underline}.
[It would seek to establish escalation dominance]{.underline} and
confront NATO with a binary choice of either accepting defeat or further
intensification of fighting. [Such intensification might involve a move
to the nuclear level,]{.underline} but [Russia would also have
conventional escalation options]{.underline}, such as conventional deep
strikes. At the same time, it should be highlighted that Russia is
unlikely to start a conflict which involves a high degree of uncertainty
about its final outcome and carries a risk of military defeat. Russia
cannot safely assume that US-led NATO would act with restraint, nor
could it be sure that the Alliance would be ready to surrender and
terminate a conflict early. [For internal reasons Russia cannot afford
to lose a "big war]{.underline}", so the most prudent option would
generally be not to initiate such a conflict in the first place. Such
[logic]{.underline} could, however, [get lost in some of the hybrid
scenarios and scenarios of an inadvertent outbreak of a
conflict]{.underline}. [On the NATO side,]{.underline} [conflict
termination has not been the focus of close attention]{.underline}, as
[the Alliance has concentrated in recent years on strengthening
deterrence]{.underline} and probing the issue of defence. As one of the
workshop participants put it, "NATO is in the deterring Russia business
not in the winning a war with Russia business". This is not a new
problem. War termination proved to be a difficult subject for the
Alliance in the Cold War, as it involved delicate questions about
maintaining NATO's political cohesion and dealing with the consequences
of major nuclear exchanges. Nevertheless, NATO's ability to persevere in
a conflict should not be underestimated. Opinions that NATO would
collapse following a Russian first strike seem to be based more on
stereotypes about the weakness of Western democracies than on any
insight into how Alliances actually operate during wartime, especially
when fighting a defensive war that is perceived as just. Still, it may
be assumed that NATO would have major difficulty in setting and
implementing any conflict termination strategy based on the
intensification of military pressure on Russia, especially beyond the
immediate theatre of operations. Individual Allies, first and foremost
the US, might have to take a lead in that.

[Nuclear deterrence has played a fundamental role in maintaining peace
and international security, particularly in Europe]{.underline}. I am
firmly convinced that [our deterrence strategy maintains all of its
stabilizing virtues, a particularly valuable asset in the world which we
see before us, one of competition between powers, disinhibited behaviors
and the erosion of norms.]{.underline} The [fundamental purpose of
France\'s nuclear strategy]{.underline}, the doctrinal bases of which I
have just set out, [is to prevent war.]{.underline} Our nuclear forces
are not directed towards any specific country and France has always
refused that nuclear weapons be considered as a battlefield weapons. I
hereby reaffirm that France will never engage into a nuclear battle or
any forms of graduated response. Furthermore, [our nuclear forces have a
deterrent effect in themselves, particularly in Europe. They strengthen
the security of Europe through their very existence and they have, in
this sense, a truly European dimension.]{.underline} On that point, our
independent decision-making is fully compatible with our [unwavering
solidarity with our European partners. Our commitment to their security
and their defense is the natural expression of our ever-closer
solidarity. Let\'s be clear: France\'s vital interests now have a
European dimension]{.underline}. In this spirit, I would like strategic
dialogue to develop with our European partners, which are ready for it,
on the [role played by France\'s nuclear deterrence in our collective
security. European partners who are willing to walk that road can be
associated with the exercises of French deterrence forces.]{.underline}
This strategic dialogue and these exchanges will naturally contribute to
developing a true strategic culture among Europeans. Our nuclear forces
also significantly contribute to the overall strengthening of the
Atlantic Alliance\'s overall deterrent, alongside the British and
American forces. France does not take part in the Alliance\'s nuclear
planning mechanisms and will not do so in the future. But it will
continue to contribute to political-level discussions aiming to
strengthen the Alliance\'s nuclear culture. Since 1995, France and the
United Kingdom, Europe\'s only nuclear powers, have clearly stated that
they can imagine no circumstances under which a threat to the vital
interests of one would not constitute a threat to the vital interests of
the other. I want today to formally reiterate that assessment. The high
level of mutual trust, enshrined in the Lancaster House Treaties in
2010, the 10th anniversary of which we celebrate this year, is reflected
in our daily and unprecedented cooperation on nuclear issues. We will
steadfastly maintain this cooperation and Brexit will have no impact at
all in this regard.

#### US nuclear umbrella fails to deter Russia because of US decision making and domestic politics-UK and France are the only credible deterrent

**Walt 21** Professor of International relations at the Harvard Kennedy
School at Harvard University and a political scientist. Ph. D in
Political Science from UC Berkeley. (Stephen M. Walt, 3-23-21, \"It's
Time to Fold America's Nuclear Umbrella,\" Foreign Policy,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/03/23/its-time-to-fold-americas-nuclear-umbrella/)HS

A recent report by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, "Preventing
Nuclear Proliferation and Reassuring America's Allies," took a small
step in a rather surprising direction. The title captures its main theme
perfectly: To discourage its allies from acquiring their own nuclear
weapons, the United States needs to counter doubts raised during the
Trump administration and reassure its allies about the strength of the
United States' commitment to their security.

Given that the [report was written by a multinational group of
well-known foreign-policy insider]{.underline}s, most of their findings
and prescriptions are unproblematic. But the following recommendation
caught my eye:

"Europe needs to build up the nuclear dimension of its defense efforts,
including by retaining and modernizing capabilities for existing NATO
nuclear missions and by France and Britain working together to extend
their nuclear deterrents to their European allies."

Why is this statement so intriguing? Because it shows the authors of
this report recognize that [Europe as a whole might be more secure if it
could rely on a locally based deterrent instead of continuing to shelter
under the U.S. nuclear umbrella.]{.underline} And if that is true for
the nations of Europe, then it might well be true for others. Although
the report's authors are [opposed to new states joining the nuclear club
(Britain and France are already members]{.underline}), their statement
clearly implies that [deterrence would be strengthened if states facing
serious external threats had a nuclear guarantee that didn't depend on
Uncle Sam.]{.underline}

This is hardly a new issue. Since fairly early in the nuclear age, the
United States has used nuclear weapons to "extend deterrence" and shield
some of its allies. It sought to convince potential adversaries that the
United States might use its formidable nuclear arsenal if these allies
were attacked, even if the United States was not. Of course, there was
always some chance that a war involving one of the United States' allies
might escalate to the nuclear level, either by accident, through
inadvertence, or via deliberate decision, no matter what U.S. leaders
said in advance. Even so, Washington went to considerable lengths to
make its nuclear umbrella credible, partly to discourage enemies from
attacking but also to convince its allies not to get nuclear weapons
themselves.

Accordingly, U.S. leaders made [lots of public statements linking the
U.S. arsenal to its core alliance commitments]{.underline}, and NATO
drew up various plans and doctrinal pronouncements designed to reinforce
perceptions of a reliable U.S. guarantee. The United States also
deployed thousands of warheads on some of its allies' territory, along
with dual-key arrangements that gave those allies some say in how, when,
or if these fearsome weapons got used. Lastly, and very importantly, the
United States kept trying to achieve a meaningful degree of nuclear
superiority to make a possible first use of nuclear weapons to defend
allies more credible. Instead of acquiring a "minimum deterrent" (i.e.,
retaliatory forces that could survive any possible attack and then
inflict unacceptable damage on an aggressor), U.S. war plans and weapons
decisions always focused on trying to come out on top in the awful event
of an actual nuclear war.

Why did the United States do this? In good part because convincing
people you might use nuclear weapons to defend an ally isn't easy. One
might imagine a U.S. president using nuclear weapons to retaliate
against a direct attack on U.S. territory or to deter the extremely
unlikely prospect of a conventional invasion that threatened U.S.
independence. [This is the one thing nuclear weapons are good for:
deterring existential threats to their possessors' independence or
autonomy]{.underline}. This form of deterrence (sometimes termed "basic"
or "Type I") works because the deterring side will almost certainly care
more about preserving its own independence than a potential attacker is
likely to care about trying to take it away. Because the balance of
resolve favors the defender, even [much weaker nuclear powers can deter
enemies from attacking them directly]{.underline}. If you don't find
this argument persuasive, remember the [U.S. attacked non-nuclear Iraq
in 2003 and non-nuclear Libya in 2011, but it leaves nuclear-armed North
Korea alone.]{.underline}

By contrast, [deterring a conventional or a nuclear attack on an ally by
threatening to go nuclear---and convincing your allies that you really
mean it---is more challenging.]{.underline} It is one thing to threaten
to use nuclear weapons to keep one's own country from being subjugated
but quite another to do so to save an ally from defeat or domination.
Or, as people used to wonder back in the Cold War, [would a U.S.
president really risk Washington or Chicago to save Paris or
Berlin?]{.underline} Long after they had left office, a few [former U.S.
officials suggested the answer was almost certainly "no."]{.underline}
Extended deterrence could still work because potential attackers can't
be sure about any of this, but it still [isn't as credible as deterring
attacks on one's own territory.]{.underline}

The solution to this conundrum---if one can call it that---is to achieve
overwhelming "nuclear superiority." If you could wipe out an adversary's
entire nuclear force in a first strike, you wouldn't have to fear its
retaliation, and using nuclear weapons to defend an ally would be much
more credible. Even if a splendid first strike were not possible,
perhaps you could convince a potential attacker that it will end up even
worse off than you are at the end of a nuclear war to convince it not to
put so much as a toe on the first rung of the escalation ladder.

Thus, the perceived need to extend deterrence is one of the reasons why
the United States has long sought nuclear superiority. It's not the only
reason: A genuine first strike capability could limit damage in the
event of an actual war. A few commentators have also tried to
argue---not very convincingly---that superiority would enable the
stronger side to coerce weaker states in crises. Chasing the holy grail
of a first-strike advantage was also popular with defense contractors
and parts of the armed services because it requires spending billions of
dollars annually on more and more accurate weapons, more efficient and
destructive warheads, improved surveillance and anti-submarine warfare
capabilities, and lots of other shiny objects.

Interestingly, a number of sophisticated scholars have recently claimed
that [technological advances have put the United States on the brink of
a true first-strike capability.]{.underline} Perhaps in theory, but
certainly not as a usable option. To see why, ask yourself what you
would do if you were president and facing a serious crisis with a
nuclear-armed adversary. You've put the armed services on alert, and
there is some danger that force might be used and fighting could
escalate. Suppose your military advisors and intelligence experts tell
you if you order a first strike now, you can almost certainly destroy
the enemy's entire nuclear arsenal, leaving the United States unscathed
and in an ideal position to resolve the dispute on favorable terms.

Being a sensible person, you'd undoubtedly ask them: "Can you guarantee
that? Are you absolutely, 100 percent sure the enemy will have zero
usable weapons left, and therefore, we won't even get our hair mussed?"

"We are highly confident of success," you are told. "But there is a
[slim chance that a few enemy weapons would survive and reach U.S. soil.
No more than one to three]{.underline}."

[Even if you weren't troubled by the moral issues]{.underline} involved
in ordering an attack that would kill untold numbers of people (and you
ought to be), would you do it? Of course you wouldn't, because you
[wouldn't want to risk losing New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, or
any other major U.S. city]{.underline}, which is what might happen if
that first strike you authorized turned out to be just a tiny bit less
effective than your advisors predicted. To issue a launch order, you'd
[have to believe the proposed attack would work perfectly the very first
time it was executed]{.underline} (simulations and exercises aren't the
same), [almost all of the missiles and bombs that have been sitting in
silos or storage facilities for years would work as designed, and the
other side wouldn't have dispersed its own forces or hidden some extra
weapons in places you had failed to detect.]{.underline} Based on
everything the United States' knows about complex military operations
and the limits of intelligence, [you'd be a fool to roll the
dice]{.underline} in this way.

One more thing: [As first-strike capabilities improve, adversaries may
respond by keeping forces on higher alert or adopting
"launch-on-warning" procedures that increase the risk of accidental or
inadvertent war.]{.underline} No matter what U.S. forces are capable of
in theory, in short[, it's hard to see how any president would be
willing to use nukes first even if the probability of "success" was
extremely high]{.underline}. This reality [casts further doubt on the
whole idea of extended deterrence]{.underline}, insofar as it is based
on the threat to deliberately escalate to the nuclear level if a key
ally is in danger of being conquered.

Extending a [protective umbrella over allies in Europe]{.underline} and
Asia [may have made good sense during the Cold War,]{.underline} both to
protect them and to discourage proliferation. But the [nuclear weapons
environment has changed]{.underline}: The number of nuclear-armed states
has crept upward, and several countries (India, Pakistan, and [the
United Kingdom) are increasing the size of their own
arsenals]{.underline} (though they remain far lower than U.S. or Russian
levels). Moreover, the United States is not as tightly coupled to some
of its traditional allies as it was during the Cold War, and [serious
rifts may continue to grow despite the Biden administration's efforts
t]{.underline}o restore alliance solidarity and reassert U.S.
leadership.

Which raises the obvious question: [Does it still make sense to shield
allies under the U.S. nuclear umbrella?]{.underline} Using the threat of
nuclear use to protect other countries is not cost- or risk-free, and it
[may even be more dangerous than letting some other states acquire
arsenals of their own]{.underline} and encouraging them to [rely on
"Type I" deterrence provided by their own national
capabilities.]{.underline}

This view has been advanced before---most notably by Kenneth Waltz in a
controversial Adelphi Paper 40 years ago. Waltz was not advocating
giving other states the bomb or arguing that the rapid spread of nuclear
weapons would be desirable; his central point was that trying to prevent
the slow spread of these weapons was not without costs of its own and
that in some cases, as he put it, "more may be better." The question is:
Is that becoming the case today?

To be sure, folding the nuclear umbrella might well have some negative
effects. It might make states long accustomed to U.S. protection
question its commitment (though there's no logical reason for them to do
so if it is still in the United States' interest to aid their defense in
other ways). It could also reduce U.S. influence or leverage if certain
allies were no longer as dependent on U.S. protection, though folding
the umbrella would not eliminate their reliance on other elements of
U.S. power. [Removing the U.S. nuclear guarantee might encourage a few
states to pursue nuclear arms of their own]{.underline}, but it is not
obvious that [acquisition by Japan or Germany]{.underline} would be a
terrible outcome from a purely U.S. perspective.

Moreover, even the [possibility that these states might take over
responsibility for deterring attacks on their own territory could have a
sobering effect on]{.underline} a rising China and [a recalcitrant
Russia]{.underline}. In particular, [it would remind]{.underline}
Beijing and [Moscow that their own behavior will affect the strategic
calculations that their neighbors make in the near future, including
decisions about nuclear arms]{.underline}. If China doesn't want to face
more nuclear weapons states in its immediate region, for instance, then
[its leaders should start asking themselves what they can do to make
those neighbors feel less need for additional protection]{.underline}.
The obvious answer: Stop harassing them in various ways, drop the
sharp-elbowed approach to diplomacy, stick to agreements previously
reached, and do more to resolve existing disputes on a fair-minded
basis.

Whatever Washington ultimately chooses to do with its nuclear umbrella,
the more important task is to move beyond the tendency to see nuclear
weapons as potent signs of status, indispensable tools of statecraft, or
powerful sources of leverage. Nuclear weapons are extremely useful for
deterring direct and all-out attacks on one's own homeland but not much
else. For that purpose, a great power doesn't need an enormous arsenal
or some hypothetical capability to "fight and win" a nuclear exchange.
[All it needs is a stockpile that can survive an enemy attack and be
able to respond in kind.]{.underline} [Properly concealed or protected,
they don't need to be poised and ready to strike at a moment's
notice.]{.underline} Fetishizing the bomb and using it to try to protect
others isn't just expensive; it may also be dangerous

always been the premise of "deterrence of the strong by the weak"---and
is not connected with the size of the other party's nuclear arsenal as

#### Nuclear force upgrade bolster French deterrence

**Wright and Decis 21** \*Research Analyst and Programme Administrator

\"Counting the cost of deterrence: France's nuclear recapitalisation,\"
IISS, https://www .iiss.org/blogs/mili
tary-balance/2021/05/france-nuclear-recapitalisation)HS

Having [formally launched the development of its third generation of
nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, France is embarking on a
broad renewal of its nuclear forces]{.underline}. The aim is to [ensure
that its deterrent remains credible into, and beyond, the middle of this
century]{.underline}, explain Timothy Wright and Hugo Decis. As [the
50-year mark approaches since France commissioned its first
nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine]{.underline} (SSBN, or SNLE
in French), [Paris has now formally launched the development of its
third generation of SSBNs -- a key element in its broader nuclear-forces
modernisation programme. The parallel threads of the wider modernisation
effort draw together developments to ballistic and air-launched cruise
missiles and their respective launch platforms,]{.underline} but will
also place a burden on defence expenditure. The first of the four boats
to replace the current second-generation Le Triomphant-class is meant to
be commissioned by 2035 -- the same year in which the successor to the
ASMPA ramjet-power nuclear-armed air-to-surface missile, the ASN4G, is
expected to enter service. The Le Triomphant successor, presently known
as the SNLE 3G, is also associated with the M51.4 submarine-launched
ballistic missile (SLBM), which will be a further improvement on the M51
and will likely be required by the early 2040s. The delivery platform
for the ASN4G hypersonic cruise missile, the SCAF/Next Generation
Fighter (NGF) multi-role combat aircraft, is also planned to enter
service at the beginning of the 2040s. Collectively, these projects will
renew France's strategic and sub-strategic nuclear forces but will also
be a significant burden on defence expenditure over the next two
decades. France's 2021 draft defence budget earmarked €5 billion
(US\$6bn) for nuclear-related work, a figure close to 13% of core
(excluding pensions) defence funding of €39.2bn (US\$47.2bn) for the
year. Submarine size and weapons The SNLE 3G is expected to be slightly
larger than the Le Triomphant-class, with a submerged displacement of
approximately 15,000 tonnes and a crew complement of about 100. As was
the case with its predecessor, the SNLE 3G will be fitted with 16 launch
tubes and armed with the M51 family of SLBM, as well as with torpedoes
and anti-ship missiles (AShMs) for self-defence purposes. The SNLE 3G
will, however, have a new sonar suite intended to improve detection and
help counter likely increased threats to future submarine operations.
The yet-to-be-named class of SSBNs will also be fitted with a new and
more powerful reactor, developed from the K15 model which is currently
used by both the Le Triomphant-class of SSBNs and the Charles de Gaulle
aircraft carrier. In the interim period before the SNLE 3G enters
service, the French Navy will receive an improved version of the M51,
the M51.3, which is due to be introduced in 2025. The missile will use
the same warhead design, the Tête nucléaire océanique introduced in
2016, but will feature a revised third stage. France's current SLBM, the
M51.2, employs a solid-propellant third stage from the earlier M45 SLBM.
The upgraded solid-propellant motor will likely increase the M51.3's
range beyond the reported 6,000 kilometre+ range of the M51.2, although
the extent of this increase has not been made public. An M51 missile was
tested on 28 April 2021 by the French Directorate of Armaments (DGA),
which is responsible for developing and procuring France's new SLBM. The
test launch was conducted from a submerged platform at the DGA's Essais
de missiles site in the Landes region. As for the further planned SLBM
upgrade in the form of the M51.4, while there has been little public
mention of this upgrade, part of the rationale for its development may
be to try to ensure that the SLBM is capable of beating projected
ballistic-missile defences. One option to help achieve this aim could
include upgrading the M51's current post-boost vehicle (PBV), which is
derived from the earlier M45 SLBM. PBVs are small liquid-fuelled
propulsion systems that can be used by missiles with multiple
independently targetable re-entry vehicle payloads to release the
warheads during the terminal phase of flight, allowing them to follow
separate trajectories and thus to strike at different targets. An
upgraded PBV could complicate an adversary's missile defences through
more dispersed targeting options, while providing the submarine-based
nuclear force with greater targeting flexibility. Dyad elements The new
class of SSBNs will be complemented by the ASN4G from 2035. Initially
carried by the air force's Rafale B and the navy's Rafale M, the ASN4G
missile will also be part of the NGF's weapons inventory from the 2040s
onwards. The NGF is a tri-national effort between France, Germany and
Spain to develop a successor to the Rafale and the Eurofighter. France,
however, is the only partner to require that the successor be a
nuclear-capable aircraft, and that it also be able to operate from an
aircraft carrier. Concept work on the ASN4G has been under way since
2014. France is also one of a small but growing number of countries
[exploring the potential of hypersonic boost-glide
technology]{.underline}. Its V-MaX (véhicule manoeuvrant experimental)
project began towards the end of the last decade to explore the
potential of very-high-speed glide body designs, with the aim of
conducting flight-test experiments from 2021. Whether Paris is
interested in the potential application of a hypersonic glide vehicle as
an element of its nuclear-deterrent force remains to be seen. What is
clear, however, is [that France is embarking on a broad renewal of its
nuclear forces with the aim of ensuring that its deterrent remains
credible into, and beyond, the middle of this century]{.underline}. The
twin objectives of sustaining this impetus and meeting the technical and
budgetary demands of the developments now lie ahead.

#### French nuclear umbrella that solves.

**DW 20**, Deutsche Welle is the German public international broadcast
funded by the German federal tax budget (6-20-20, \"How will Europe
guarantee its security without the US?,\" DW,
https://www.dw.com/en/how-will-europe-guarantee-its-security-without-the-us/a-53881805)

Days after US President [Donald]{.underline} Trump
[announced]{.underline} the [withdrawal of]{.underline} roughly **[one
third of]{.underline}** US **[troops]{.underline}** stationed in
Germany, **[the shock still lingers]{.underline}**.

[Politicians]{.underline} at every level [are grappling with the
consequences]{.underline}: Mayors in economically weak regions are
worried about losing income when the GIs leave, [Germany\'s foreign
minister is worried about the **further deterioration** of
relations]{.underline} with the US and **[military planners in
Brussels]{.underline}** [are pondering the implication for Europe\'s own
security architecture. Germany has been a key component of]{.underline}
the [US defense strategy in Europe]{.underline} for decades, [with US
**nuclear weapons**]{.underline} --- to be **[delivered by German
fighter jets]{.underline}** in a moment of crisis --- [stationed
here]{.underline}.

But if the roughly 9,500 US soldiers go home rather than head somewhere
else in Europe, [it will **radically shift** military relations on the
continent. \"It is entirely unclear where this journey is
heading]{.underline} and what security risks lie ahead,\" said Thomas
Kleine-Brockhoff, vice president of the Berlin-based German Marshall
Fund, a non-partisan trans-Atlantic think tank.

Kleine-Brockhoff said he can\'t make out a winner yet, not even
neighboring Poland, which can realistically maintain hopes of an
increased US troop presence. He told DW the weakening of ties between
Germany and the US is damaging to the whole of Europe, and Central and
Eastern European countries have taken note.

European security without American might

\"[Europe will have to take on more responsibility,\" said Roderich
**Kiesewetter**]{.underline}, a former [military officer who is now a
parliamentary **foreign policy expert** for Angela Merkel\'s Christian
Democratic Union party. That statement **echoes demands**]{.underline}
often [made by]{.underline} relevant department heads and by [the
chancellor herself]{.underline}. Still, when it comes to defining what
that new European role might be, **[German policymakers]{.underline}**
prefer to **[leave all of their options open]{.underline}**.

Might that mean Germany and Europe would take the burden of smaller
crisis regions off American shoulders, allowing the US to focus on Asia
and rival China? Or will the German government succumb to years of
pressure from the US and NATO to increase defense spending and finally
pass massive military budgets?

That latter is exactly the approach backed by foreign policy expert
Kleine-Brockhoff. \"[During the refugee and **coronavirus crises** the
German government has shown it is willing to **allocate huge sums of
money**,\"]{.underline} he pointed out.

Or is [Germany ready for a]{.underline} paradigm shift --- working
toward [a Europe that can protect itself]{.underline}, without the US?

Repeated overtures

Should that final option be the secret desire of German politicians, it
would no doubt bring out every last EU political and military
heavyweight between Berlin and Paris. And it would also put the
spotlight on an uncomfortable issue for the Germans: their stance on
nuclear weapons --- which are, after all, considered the last guarantor
of independent sovereignty.

[Germany has been under the protection of NATO\'s nuclear
umbrella]{.underline} --- and thus also the US --- for decades, [and if
Europe wants to provide its own security it will have to come up with a
**replacement shield**]{.underline}. As things stand now, [**France
would be the only choice** in stepping up to the task.]{.underline}
France has not been shy about splurging on its \"Force de frappe\"
nuclear strike force. But [French leaders have also been careful to
maintain distance to NATO and the US on that front: French missiles have
**never been integrated into NATO**]{.underline} defense
planning.Nevertheless, in the past the [French have **made clear** their
willingness to **allow Germany proximity** to its prized
arsenal]{.underline}. In the 1990s, President Jacques [Chirac even
considered the concept of **joint responsibility**]{.underline}. And
during his term, Nicolas [Sarkozy]{.underline} is said to have [offered
Merkel a financial stake]{.underline} in the program. **[At the
time]{.underline}**, [the Germans thanked the French]{.underline} for
their offer [but refused]{.underline}, **[with a nod to the US
shield.]{.underline}**

Macron\'s opening

**[Earlier this year]{.underline}**, President Emmanuel [Macron made a
new proposition, invitin]{.underline}g his European [partners to take
part in a \"strategic dialogue\" on France\'s nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. Though it was unclear how the offer should be
taken, the German Defense Ministry accepted the invitation during a
meeting in Paris --- though not without stressing the significance of
the US umbrella while doing so.

Four months on, the public has yet to see any of the fruits of that
meeting. A **[Defense Ministry spokesman]{.underline}** would only go so
far as to confirm that \"the question of a nuclear deterrent in Europe
was addressed within the framework of regular rotating discussions on
various strategic issues.\"

The fact that there have been no public announcements no doubt has to do
with the sensitivity of the issue of nuclear deterrence. [\"When the US
umbrella]{.underline} and its nuclear posture in Europe and other places
[is called into question,\" said Kleine-Brockhoff, \"a lot of **small
and medium-sized countries** will feel the need to become nuclear
powers]{.underline} themselves.\" [**Uncertainty alone** could set off a
**chain reaction** among partners and rivals alike.]{.underline}

Still, [the issue of whether or not to create a European]{.underline}
nuclear [umbrella could well arise **should Trump complete a US
withdrawal** from Europe]{.underline} that started long before he came
to office. \"[I would advise the government to take a two-pronged
approach]{.underline},\" [said]{.underline} Christian
[Mölling]{.underline}, a [security expert at the German Council on
Foreign Relations]{.underline}, a Berlin-based think tank. He said [they
should \"keep their option to move to the French system
open]{.underline},\" but added that such a major shift would take
decades.

Weapons system **[the start of something bigger?]{.underline}**

The [Future Combat Air System]{.underline} (FCAS), [a Franco-German
project to develop a complex air-based defense system by
2040]{.underline} --- one that [will play a key role in the French
deterrence strategy]{.underline} --- could prove a good opportunity to
deepen trust. \"Twenty years to build trust and a shared perspective ---
that\'s not a lot of time. At least not for fundamental change in policy
direction,\" said Mölling.

Beyond the obvious technical challenges, a look at both partners also
illustrates how disparate mindsets within the cooperation can be:
[Nuclear deterrent is the heart of France\'s security architecture,
while in Germany some politicians are calling for the **withdrawal of
all US nuclear weapons**.]{.underline}

[The one seemingly intractable conflict]{.underline} inherent [in the
idea of a \"European bomb,\"]{.underline} however, [is the question of
**who would decide to use it** when a split-second decision is
needed]{.underline}. [In France, that duty **falls to the
president**]{.underline}, [who is closely **followed
everywhere**]{.underline} [he goes by an officer carrying the nation\'s
nuclear codes.]{.underline}

There are no easy answers, but [Germany will likely have to get used to
the French nuclear mindset in the coming yea]{.underline}rs.
Establishing independent European security --- if such a thing is
possible --- would take years to realize. But it\'s never too early to
start thinking about it.

with the courage to address the clear and present danger Turkish
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ambitions pose beyond Turkey's borders.
France has taken a leadership role in Europe as Germany and the United
Kingdom continue to avoid exercising sound judgment and taking
appropriate action in European security matters. French President Macron
is correct in stating Europe must embrace "strategic autonomy" and take
greater ownership of its security interests beyond the framework of
NATO. Macron understands.

Erdogan remains defiant.

He condemned the sanctions as a "blatant attack" on Turkish sovereign
efforts to establish an independent defense industry. And political
parties representing a large majority of Turkey's Parliament have issued
a joint declaration opposing the US decision. Turkey's Foreign Ministry
has stated Turkey "will retaliate in a manner and timing it deems
appropriate." Erdogan has threatened to close Turkish bases to US

For most close observers, [it has long seemed only a [**matter of time**
before]{.mark} the long]{.underline}, bloody [**proxy [war]{.mark}**
between **[Turkey]{.mark}** and **[Russia]{.mark}** for regional
**predominance** in the **Middle East** would **[break out]{.mark}**
into full-scale]{.underline} direct [hostilities. That came
closer]{.underline} to happening [last week, when
Russian]{.underline}-backed [**Syrian forces** attacked a
Turkish]{.underline} military [outpost]{.underline} in Idlib province,
leaving more than 30 Turkish soldiers dead. However, [few observers
would have predicted the **utter impotence** of Turkey's]{.underline}
ostensible [military partners in **NATO** in the face]{.underline} of
what is arguably [[the]{.mark} **gravest [threat]{.mark}** [to
the]{.mark} **future of the [alliance]{.mark}** since]{.underline} the
[Russian annexation of Crimea]{.underline} in 2014.

[In retaliation for]{.underline} last week's [attack]{.underline}, which
some initial reports claimed was the work of Russian bombers,
[Turkey]{.underline} has [[pounded Syrian forces with drone
strikes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sebastienroblin/2020/03/02/idlib-onslaught-turkish-drones-artillery-and-f-16s-just-destroyed-over-100-armored-vehicles-in-syria-and-downed-two-jets/) and]{.underline}
taken out the Syrian army's Russian-made [anti-aircraft
batteries]{.underline}. Earlier this week, [Russian [warships in]{.mark}
the **Black [Sea]{.mark}**]{.underline} fleet [steamed across the
Bosporus strait to [boost]{.mark}]{.underline} the [Russian **navy's
[presence]{.mark}** [in the]{.mark} eastern
**[Med]{.mark}iterranean**]{.underline}.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan flew to Moscow on Thursday for an
emergency [summit with Russian President Vladimir
Putin](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2020-03-04/russia-turkey-talks-a-last-chance-to-avert-idlib-calamity) to
tamp down tensions. They announced yet another cease-fire in Idlib and
joint patrols in a corridor along a strategic highway, but [the deal is
likely to be **temporary** and **tenuous** at best]{.underline}.

[To increase his **leverage** prior to the trip, [Erdogan sought]{.mark}
**support** from **[NATO]{.mark}**,]{.underline} including the
imposition of a no-fly zone in northwestern Syria. Following an
emergency meeting last Friday, [the [alliance expressed its "**full
solidarity**" with Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline}, but announced no
specific measures to assist it.

[The question]{.underline} now [is whether any of the]{.underline} 26
European [members of the alliance [realize how **pivotal**]{.mark}
Turkey's **clash with [Russia]{.mark}** [is for]{.mark} the **future of
[NATO]{.mark}** and **security** on the European continent]{.underline}.

[As **proxy wars** go, [the]{.mark} **ongoing [conflict]{.mark}**
between **Turkey and Russia** in the Middle East]{.underline} has in
many ways [hewed closely to script]{.underline}. For nearly a decade,
[the two]{.underline} have [[danced **on the**]{.mark} **edge** of the
**escalatory [precipice]{.mark}**[, deploying]{.mark} **irregular
[forces]{.mark}** [along]{.mark} the narrow corridor of [Syria's]{.mark}
**northern [border]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In December 2015, [Turkey
downed]{.underline} two [Russian fighter jets]{.underline} it claimed
had entered its airspace, [raising fears of **direct
conflict**]{.underline}. But Erdogan and Putin were able to deescalate
the situation, and they subsequently arrived at an understanding for
operating discretely---and often at cross-purposes---in Syria, while
avoiding any more direct confrontations.

More recently, in January, [Turkey and Russia's battle for **regional
primacy** took a **sharper turn**, as thousands
of Turkish]{.underline}-backed Syrian rebel [fighters began **streaming
into Libya** to defend]{.underline} the internationally recognized
Government of National Accord in Tripoli [against an]{.underline} ever
more [aggressive campaign]{.underline} mounted by the forces of Gen.
Khalifa Haftar with the support of Russian mercenaries.

Almost from the start of Syria's civil war in 2011, [Erdogan began
cultivating a mix of **secular** and **Islamist**]{.underline} armed
[factions fighting to topple]{.underline} President [Bashar al-Assad's
regime]{.underline}. On the other side, Russia took incremental steps
toward protecting Assad, first deploying Russian warplanes to provide
air support, and then Russian private military contractors with the
Wagner Group and other cutouts from Russian state enterprises to train
up and fight alongside a hodgepodge of Syrian army forces and local
militias.

The Wagner Group's involvement in Syria burst into the spotlight after
it suffered serious setbacks in [skirmishes with U.S.
forces](https://warontherocks.com/2018/07/the-puzzle-of-russian-behavior-in-deir-al-zour/) in
Deir Ezzor in 2018. By then, its fighters had been [helping Haftar
secure oil production
facilities](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/29/libyas-war-explained-khalifa-haftar-oil-cuts-uae-airstrikes-and-russian-mercenaries.html) in
eastern Libya for at least a year. Three years on, it now seems that
[[the]{.mark} **negative [feedback loop]{.mark}** [between]{.mark} the
two **proxy [wars]{.mark}** in Libya and Syria has [become]{.mark} so
intense that **years** of]{.underline} relatively [stable **crisis
management** between Moscow and Ankara may]{.underline} finally [be at
an end]{.underline}.

The trouble is [there are]{.underline} truly [no **obvious answers** for
solving the conundrum [**provoked** by]{.mark} Putin's and Erdogan's
[**adventurism**, and that]{.mark} should [scare **every**]{.mark}
**one** of **NATO's [member]{.mark}s**]{.underline}.

With [the U.S. effectively **sidelined** by]{.underline} a combination
of White House [incompetence]{.underline} and election year jitters
about wading deeper into the Middle East, [there is **little
evidence**]{.underline} the most powerful member of [the North Atlantic
alliance will be willing]{.underline} or able [to **influence Turkey**
to deescalate]{.underline}. The European members, meanwhile, are up in
arms over Erdogan's bold and cynical effort to pressure NATO to come to
its aid by [opening its border with Greece to Syrian
refugees](https://www.bbc.com/news/video_and_audio/headlines/51700885/migrants-clash-with-greek-police-at-the-turkish-border),
thereby threatening a repeat of the 2015 refugee crisis.

[Since becoming a **full member** of the North Atlantic
alliance]{.underline} in 1952, Turkey has actively supported multiple
NATO missions, most critically perhaps by investing millions of dollars
in support of stabilization efforts in Afghanistan over the past 19
years. As a result, [[Turkey]{.mark} was]{.underline} until recently
[viewed as a **rock-solid ally**]{.underline} in Washington and
Brussels. [Its progressive **descent** into the]{.underline}
schizophrenic **[politics of autocracy]{.underline}**, however, [has
[**driven a wedge** between]{.mark} Erdogan and]{.underline} his
American and [European [allies]{.mark}. That has come back to **haunt
him**]{.underline} now, [leaving him with **few**]{.underline} real
[**friends** inside]{.underline} or outside [the NATO
alliance]{.underline}.

On Wednesday, it appeared that Erdogan was also losing sway
domestically, as [fist fights broke out in Turkey's
parliament](https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/04/watch-brawl-in-turkish-parliament-over-military-action-in-syria) over
his handling of the military crisis in Syria. [[This]{.mark} latest
**political upheaval** should give]{.underline} Turkey's [partners in
NATO]{.underline} real [pause]{.underline}. If Erdogan's government is
unsuccessful in tamping down political fractures over the crisis in
Syria, [how long before dissent turns into]{.underline} even [greater
**internal instability** in Turkey?]{.underline}

Under the circumstances, [Turkey's European partners are faced with a
**choice** between the **lesser of two evils**]{.underline}. Delivering
more humanitarian aid and financial support via the European Union for
Syrian refugees already in Turkey might seem like a costly and less than
optimal solution to the burgeoning crisis. But at the very least, it
would be a show of support for Erdogan, at a time when [there is a very
**real possibility**]{.underline} that [Turkey [will]{.mark} **purposely
or inadvertently [spark]{.mark}** an **open [conflict]{.mark}** with
Russia]{.underline}. If that happens, [[NATO would]{.mark} be forced to
**seriously [consider]{.mark}** whether an **[Article 5]{.mark}
declaration** of]{.underline} mutual [defense would be an appropriate
response]{.underline}.

It would be nice to think that NATO's charter still meant something to
its members, and 19 years of mutual defense in Afghanistan following
9/11 certainly suggest that it does. But [the **Turkish-Russian
[standoff]{.mark}** [points]{.mark}]{.underline} up [[a]{.mark}n obvious
**design [flaw]{.mark}** in the alliance]{.underline}. When the big
players at the table like the U.S. decide to sit out a bad hand,
European alliance members who have more at stake but fewer military
chits to lay down are unlikely to ante up. Turkey is by far one of the
most politically isolated members of the NATO bloc. But [if NATO's
assurances **do not hold up**, that is **not a good look** for a
**military alliance**]{.underline}.

### Turkey\-\--2NC

#### They'll capitalize on an [indulgent NATO]{.underline} and intervene in [Nagorno-Karabakh]{.underline}\-\--that rapidly spirals into [great-power war]{.underline} and [draws the world]{.underline} into the Southern Caucasus. 

**Gramer '20** \[Robbie and Jack Detsch; October 6; Diplomacy and
national security reporter, studied international relations and European
affairs at American University; Pentation and national security
reporter; Foreign Policy, "Turkey's Caucasus Adventure Risks Another
Crisis in NATO,"
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/10/06/turkeys-caucasus-nagorno-karabakh-conflict-risks-nato-crisis-armenia-azerbaijan/>\]

[The **conflict** between **Armenia** and **Azerbaijan** over the
disputed region of **Nagorno-Karabakh**]{.underline} has [fueled a
**fresh fight** within NATO, with alliance members **pushing Turkey** to
dial back its **aggressive foreign policy**]{.underline} and support a
cease-fire in the Caucasus.

As the [conflict]{.underline} over the disputed territory has
[escalated]{.underline} over the past week, leaving over 200 people dead
and hundreds more injured, [NATO]{.underline} Secretary-General Jens
Stoltenberg [called on Turkey to **defuse** the situation,
given]{.underline} its decades of [support for Azerbaijan]{.underline}.
"We are deeply concerned by the escalation of hostilities. All sides
should immediately cease fighting," Stoltenberg said during a visit to
Ankara, the Turkish capital, on Monday. "I expect Turkey to use its
considerable influence to calm tensions."

But [Turkey has **dug in its heels**, **defying** a joint call from the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [**France**, and
**Russia** for an immediate cease-fire in Nagorno-Karabakh]{.underline}.
"We look at the calls coming from around the world, and it's 'immediate
cease-fire.' What then? There was a cease-fire until now, but what
happened?" said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Tuesday
during a visit to Azerbaijan. 

[In **crisis after crisis**]{.underline} in recent years, [Turkey's
**relations** with]{.underline} many of [its **NATO allies** have
frayed, but they've never **fully collapsed**. Turkey]{.underline} has
[purchased Russian air defense systems]{.underline} and angered
Washington. Turkey has [squared off with **Greece** and **France** in
the **Eastern Mediterranean**, invaded **northeastern Syria**, and waded
into the **civil war** in **Libya**. All that came after]{.underline}
Turkish President Recep Tayyip [Erdogan's **authoritarian turn** in the
wake of a]{.underline} 2016 [coup]{.underline} attempt.

Now, [many are wondering where the **breaking point**
is]{.underline}---and how close it might be, [especially
with]{.underline} a potential U.S. administration under presidential
candidate Joe [**Biden** signaling a]{.underline} much [tougher line on
Turkey]{.underline} than the Trump administration's coddling. 

[Turkey's **lurch** into the **Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict**, including
the use of [Syrian
mercenaries](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/10/05/nagorno-karabakh-syrians-turkey-armenia-azerbaijan/)]{.underline} that
serve [as its **proxy army**]{.underline}, has [put]{.underline} some
powerful [NATO members in the odd position of coordinating]{.underline}
its message [with Moscow]{.underline}, which has long sided with
Armenia. (Many alliance members are on the other side of Turkey in
ongoing conflicts in Syria and Libya.) [Analysts fear]{.underline} that
[the conflict could **spiral** into **wider regional confrontations**;
both Turkey and **Israel** have a close]{.underline} security
[relationship with Azerbaijan, **Russia** has a **defense pact** with
Armenia, and neighboring **Iran** is trying to play a role
in]{.underline} mediating [the conflict]{.underline}. 

[The **latest conflict** is already **reverberating inside
NATO**]{.underline}. Canada this week announced it was halting some
weapons sales to Turkey after allegations its equipment was used
by Azerbaijani forces. Turkey's foreign ministry quickly [shot
back](https://www.jpost.com/international/canada-halts-drone-sales-to-turkey-after-claims-of-use-by-azerbaijan-644666),
accusing Canada of "double standards" by continuing to export arms to
countries involved in the war in Yemen.

[Conventional arm-twisting **might not work**]{.underline}. Experts say
Turkey is honing a style of mercenary-led combat---backed by drones for
close air support---that lends itself to flashy propaganda coups, if not
guaranteed battlefield successes. Turkish military propaganda could
leave a lasting---if outsized---impression of Ankara's might on the
battlefield, as it did during a battle in the contested Syrian province
of Idlib earlier this year.

"All you see is the strikes. It's very powerful imagery," said Aaron
Stein, the director of research at the Foreign Policy Research
Institute. "In Idlib everyone forgets that Turkey lost. All people
remember is Turkey kicking Russian ass."

["It's **lowered the barrier** to entry, it's made combat less
risky]{.underline} to them, [and it's]{.underline} highly [effective
propaganda,"]{.underline} he added.

[If bilateral tensions **spill over** into **NATO deliberations**, it
could **hamstring** the alliance's ability to make decisions on **other
areas** of importance, related to **Russia**, the **Middle East**, or
**other threats** facing the trans-Atlantic alliance. NATO operates
with]{.underline} **[consensus]{.underline}** decision-making, [meaning
**nothing is decided** until all 30 members agree]{.underline}.

["We]{.underline} still [run a **huge risk** of **bilateral disputes**
being **imported into NATO** and ... **blocking** NATO's ability to do
business,"]{.underline} said Lauren Speranza, the director of
trans-Atlantic defense and security at the Center for European Policy
Analysis. "That's nothing new, but [the **combination** of Turkey's
latest actions has pushed those discussions to the **next level**. There
are]{.underline} now [debates about how to **make Turkey recognize** the
consequences."]{.underline}

Historically, [["nuclear sharing" has played a key role in]{.mark}
reassurance of [NATO]{.mark} allies---[a highly visible manifestation of
the US commitment to]{.mark} the defense of [NATO]{.mark}. During much
of the Cold War, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [deployed
**thousands of TNW**]{.mark} on the territory of its European NATO
allies.]{.underline} The purpose of these deployments, under the broad
rubric of extended deterrence, was to underscore the political link
between the United States and Europe and provide a military capability
to deter and, if necessary, defeat numerically superior Soviet and
Warsaw Pact tank armies poised to invade NATO through Germany. NATO's
first Strategic Concept of 1949 called for insuring "the ability to
carry out strategic bombing including the prompt delivery of the atomic
bomb." The United States provided the same nuclear protection to its
principal Asian allies, assuring these nations of the US commitment to
their security. The United States and NATO continue to maintain a
"neither confirm nor deny" policy on the presence or absence of nuclear
weapons at any NATO installation or in any specific country. Moreover,
[[NATO continues to underscore the principle of nuclear
burden-sharing]{.mark}, both [through the **deployment of US nuclear
weapons** in a number of NATO states]{.mark}]{.underline} and by
agreement that, in the event of war, some of these weapons would be
transferred to allied forces and delivered by allied aircraft. NATO
members have also reaffirmed its nuclear declaratory policy of not
ruling out the first use of nuclear weapons.

#### Nuclear sharing in Europe causes nuclear escalation with Russia and heightens the risk of nuclear terrorism---withdrawal strengthens conventional deterrence and boosts alliance cohesion

[The negative political dynamic between]{.underline} the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization ([NATO]{.underline}) [and the Russian Federation
today is the frame for any discussion of NATO defense policy and
posture]{.underline}, [including NATO's nuclear posture]{.underline}.
Within this frame, unity within the alliance takes on a special meaning.
NATO is averse to taking steps that might create controversy or suggest
a lack of cohesion in the face of a newly aggressive Russia, and the
United States must be resolute in its commitment to the defense of NATO.
This stance especially has bearing today given the uncertainty that has
engulfed the Trump administration's relationships with NATO and with
Russia. The principle of collective defense enshrined in Article 5 of
the Washington Treaty is essential, and any changes to NATO's defense
policy and posture must be seen through that lens; however, [the current
security environment should not preclude Washington and NATO from
reviewing NATO's nuclear posture]{.underline}. In fact, [NATO's security
requires a hard look at and new approaches to NATO deterrence and
defense through the prism of reducing the risk of nuclear
use]{.underline}. [[**Forward-deployed** U.S. nuclear weapons]{.mark} in
Europe]{.underline} **[[increase the risk of accidents]{.mark},
blunders, or [catastrophic terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[and]{.underline} **[invite pre-emption]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Given
these added risks, [it is past time to revisit whether these
forward-based weapons are essential for military deterrence and
political reassurance]{.underline}. The Trump administration's National
Security Strategy of December 2017 commits to this continued deployment
without presenting the considered analysis that would emerge from a hard
look. The chapters in this report, written by experts and practitioners
in European security and nuclear weapons, provide a foundation for that
hard look. The report underscores the strong arguments for NATO to move
to a safer, more secure, and more credible nuclear posture without
forward-deployed U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe. The challenge is how to
advance current thinking about the military and political dimensions of
alternative nuclear postures. Regarding the military side of the ledger,
it seems clear that [[consolidating]{.mark} U.S. [nuclear
weapons]{.mark} now stored [in Europe back to the]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[**would not** diminish]{.mark} U.S. and NATO [nuclear
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A number of]{.underline} [former
senior U.S. officials and military leaders have made the point that
**[U.S. nuclear weapons based in Europe have virtually no military
utility]{.mark}**]{.underline}, primarily because of the extremely
demanding scenario for conducting a nuclear strike mission using NATO
dual-capable aircraft (DCA). [In addition to the complicated procedures
for decision making related to nuclear use, [any attempt to employ those
weapons will be]{.mark} further [complicated by the visibility]{.mark}
of the many actions [required to prepare the]{.mark} aircraft,
[weapons]{.mark}, and crews for such an attack]{.underline}---**[[all of
which undercut]{.mark} their [survivability and plausible
use]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Moreover, [those factors make]{.mark}
forward-deployed nuclear [weapons]{.mark} potential [targets]{.mark} in
the early phases of a conflict, perhaps **[triggering]{.mark} a chain of
events** that the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and NATO would want to avoid: **[early nuclear
use]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In short, [[forward-deployed nuclear weapons
in Europe]{.mark} have military liabilities, and they may, in fact,
**[increase the risk of nuclear use]{.mark} in a crisis**]{.underline}.
These dangers also apply to Russia's forward-deployed nuclear weapons.
Taken together, these shorter-range weapons in western Russia and in
Europe are a clear and present danger to both Russia and NATO,
particularly in an era of tensions, but also in an era of possible
nuclear terrorism. [What remains true and credible is that
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has
a robust strategic nuclear deterrent that is capable of being employed
deliberately anywhere on the globe in defense of U.S. interests and U.S.
allies---and it is, and should be, understood by any
potential]{.underline} (and rational) [adversary to NATO, including
Russia, in exactly this way]{.underline}. [In any crisis involving NATO,
U.S. nuclear capabilities would also be on stage with the nuclear forces
of the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[K]{.underline}**ingdom
[and France]{.underline}. Indeed, as NATO has repeatedly stated, "The
supreme guarantee of the security of the Allies is provided by the
strategic forces of the Alliance." This position has been, and remains,
the credible foundation for any plausible scenario for employing U.S.
nuclear weapons. On the security side of the ledger, [although
[returning]{.mark} forward-deployed [nuclear weapons to
the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[would not diminish NATO nuclear
capabilities]{.mark}, [it would]{.mark} unquestionably **[reduce the
risks from a potential terrorist incident or political
instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}---both of which are inherent in a
posture that stores nuclear weapons at multiple sites across multiple
countries. It is a reality that terrorists with global reach seek
nuclear capability and have operated at NATO's border and within some
NATO countries as well as Russia. Finally, the financial side of the
ledger is harder to calculate, complicated by a number of assumptions
related to absolute and marginal costs for Washington and its NATO
allies. Any savings that might be accrued by removing forward-deployed
B61s from Europe and reducing the overall purchase of B61s present only
modest marginal costs for the United States. For NATO allies of the
United States, however, the marginal costs of procuring and maintaining
DCA---and supporting U.S. nuclear weapons stored in Europe---may be
relatively larger. That said, [any [reduction in costs]{.mark}
associated with the nuclear mission **[could free up resources]{.mark}**
[for NATO to focus on]{.mark} other urgent tasks, including
**[conventional reassurance]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[cyber
defense]{.mark}**]{.underline}, depending on decisions made by NATO
member countries about their national defense budgets. One thing is
certain: although leadership cannot come from Washington alone, **[U.S.
leadership is the essential prerequisite to a reexamination of NATO
nuclear policy]{.underline}**, beginning with a compelling reaffirmation
by the president of the principle of collective defense enshrined in
Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. Washington must also take steps to
work with allies to sustain, adapt, and perhaps enhance NATO's current
procedures for nuclear sharing and consultations, consistent with a
safer, more secure, and more credible nuclear deterrent. Such steps will
not preclude the B61-12 life extension program (which also has a role in
U.S.-based strategic forces) or plans by some NATO allies to purchase
F-35 aircraft. Maintaining some dual-capable aircraft and trained pilots
in Europe, along with a residual support infrastructure for nuclear
weapons, should also be part of the overall NATO nuclear deterrence
review. [The implications of sustaining or removing U.S.
forward-deployed nuclear weapons in Europe are serious]{.underline}.
[Now is the time and the opportunity to ask whether [those weapons are
more of a security risk than an asset]{.mark} to NATO and whether they
increase or reduce the risk of nuclear use]{.underline}. We hope that
this report will help stimulate and inform such a review.

#### American nukes in Europe are strategically useless---they have no credibility and cannot be successfully launched---the current posture inevitably crushes NATO cohesion

HOW CREDIBLE IS THE POSTURE? Questions regarding the credibility---in
military terms, the sum of capability and intent---of U.S. nuclear
weapons in Europe should also be central to the debate on the future
composition of NATO's nuclear posture. [Deterrence and reassurance are
two sides of the same coin]{.underline}, and as such, [[credibility
matters]{.mark} to alliance members]{.underline}.25 As former U.K.
defense minister Denis Healey once remarked, "One only needed five per
cent credibility of American retaliation to deter the Russians, but
ninety-five per cent credibility to reassure the Europeans."26 *Alliance
Strategic and Conventional Forces vs. U.S. and European Dual-Capable
Aircraft* [[The argument that forward-deployed]{.mark} U.S. [nuclear
weapons]{.mark} in Europe [serve]{.mark} a [military function]{.mark}
not already addressed [by]{.mark} alliance [conventional
forces]{.mark}]{.underline} or the strategic nuclear forces of the three
nuclear NATO members---particularly, the large and flexible capabilities
of the United States---[[has been **consistently refuted**]{.mark} by
current and former defense officials]{.underline}.27 [Some U.S.
[strategic weapons]{.mark} today [are]{.mark} highly [flexible and
accurate]{.mark}, and they possess low or variable yields, [making the
threat of a]{.mark} prompt, tailored [strategic response]{.mark} to a
limited nuclear strike [highly credible]{.mark}]{.underline}. NATO
itself has consistently underscored that the "strategic forces of the
Alliance, particularly those of the United States, are the supreme
guarantee of the security of the Allies."28 Indeed, it is possible that
the threat of a limited U.S. response with strategic forces would be at
least as credible, if not more so, as a response with dual-capable
aircraft (DCA) from European territory. The application of strategic
forces for extended deterrence is not without precedent. During the Cold
War, NATO's requirements were coordinated with the U.S. Single
Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP), and NATO targeting was the
responsibility of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). In a
crisis, SACEUR was able to call on a number of U.S. strategic warheads
carried on U.S. Poseidon submarines and already allocated under the SIOP
to fulfill the NATO mission. Today, America's extended nuclear deterrent
in Asia continues to rely solely on U.S. strategic forces. The "Asian
model" includes less robust nuclear information sharing and consultation
than NATO uses. In a European context, such mechanisms would necessarily
be retained.29 In response to aggressive Russian actions in Ukraine, the
United States and NATO countries have taken steps to improve and
strengthen NATO conventional deterrence through the establishment of
programs such as the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) and the
Readiness Action Plan (RAP), both discussed later in this chapter in
more detail. [Additionally, the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has supplemented its already formidable
conventional deterrence in Europe with the deployment and sale of new
capabilities such as the conventional Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff
Missile to European allies and partners]{.underline}.30 *"Seven
Consecutive Miracles"* [[It is hard to envision the circumstances under
which a U.S. president would initiate nuclear use]{.mark} for the first
time in more than 70 years [with a NATO DCA flown by non-U.S.
pilots]{.mark} delivering a U.S. B61 bomb]{.underline}.
[Moreover]{.underline}, as Karl-Heinz Kamp and Robertus Remkes argued in
2011, [even if ordered, [the **political and operational
constraints**]{.mark} involved in carrying out a nuclear strike with
NATO DCA [make]{.mark} the [success]{.mark} of the mission [far from
certain]{.mark}]{.underline}.31 Kamp and Remkes describe the
[[challenges of nuclear]{.mark} strike [planning using NATO
DCA]{.mark}]{.underline}. These challenges [[include]{.mark} (1)
[surviving a first strike]{.mark}; (2) receiving the orders and
authorization from the U.S. president to conduct a nuclear strike; (3)
[successfully taking off]{.mark} and proceeding to the target; (4)
[achieving successful]{.mark} **[command, control, and
refueling]{.mark}** in flight; (5) **[surviving air defenses]{.mark}**;
(6) **[locating]{.mark}** and correctly identifying [the target]{.mark};
[and]{.mark} (7) **[carrying out the strike]{.mark}** itself with the
weapon working as designed]{.underline}. Additionally, [once the weapon
is delivered, it is far from certain that the strike crews will make it
home]{.underline}.32 Despite significant advancements in U.S. and NATO
reconnaissance and air strike capabilities, each of these challenges
underscores the difficulties created by the visibility of the many
actions required to prepare and deliver a nuclear weapon to its target
that must take place to claim an effective and credible operational
capability. [Kamp and Remkes argue [NATO cohesion]{.mark} and
credibility [through information sharing]{.mark}, consultation, [common
planning]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} common [execution]{.mark}]{.underline}
(including of the nuclear mission) [[are]{.mark} much [more important
than]{.mark} the [basing]{.mark} of U.S. [nuclear weapons in
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}.33 *Consensus for Nuclear Use at 29?*
Advocates of maintaining NATO's existing nuclear posture argue that the
DCA's most useful contribution is the highly visible example of alliance
unity and resolve--- including allies having operational roles in
planning and execution. 34 One former senior U.S. official and member of
the U.S. High Level Group delegation noted, "the B61 and DCA fleet is
the most strategic capability we have in this strategic environment that
does the most potent signaling of our Allies to stand with us."35
However, [NATO is a consensus-based organization of 29 members. It is
also highly diverse, with a range of threat perceptions and views on
nuclear use among its members]{.underline}. [That diversity
could]{.underline} potentially [be a major source of vulnerability in a
crisis, because [differences]{.mark} in views [could lead to stalled
decision making]{.mark} or lack of consensus, thereby
[undercutting]{.mark} one of the fundamental purposes of [the]{.mark}
NATO [deterrent]{.mark}]{.underline}---[to promptly signal alliance
unity and resolve in a crisis]{.underline}. [[A nuclear-use scenario
with **only partial backing**]{.mark} of the member states [could lead
to **visible divisions**]{.mark} within the alliance---a condition on
which a potential adversary would be certain to
capitalize]{.underline}.36 [[The current]{.mark} DCA
[posture]{.mark}]{.underline}, reliant in part on burden sharing through
delivery by European aircraft, **[[inevitably exacerbates those
issues]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### TNWs\-\--2NC

#### Removing American nukes from Europe is [stabilizing]{.underline}---nuclear basing encourages [pre-emptive strikes]{.underline} and increases the risks of [accidental nuclear escalation]{.underline} with Russia while encouraging [terrorist attacks]{.underline} on nuclear sites, which escalate to nuclear use. No answer to the terror portion.

#### The status quo [solves the case]{.underline}---removing nukes lowers the risk of escalation with Russia because it keeps any conflict [conventional]{.underline}, and strategic nukes housed in the US prevent Russian nuclear use.

#### Removing nukes from Europe is key to NPT credibility---they crush support for the treaty

**Hall 15**---Xanthe Hall, international disarmament campaigner for the
International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, spokesperson
for ICAN Germany ("Time for nuclear sharing to end," *Open Democracy*,
October 8^th^,
https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/xanthe-hall/time-for-nuclear-sharing-to-end)

It is a little known fact: **[Germany]{.underline}** ([and]{.underline}
four **[other [European countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**) **[[host
nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as part of NATO "nuclear
sharing".]{.underline} This means that in a nuclear attack the US can
load its bombs onto German (or Belgian, Italian, Turkish and Dutch)
aircraft and the pilots of those countries will drop them on an enemy
target. [[This]{.mark} arrangement [pre-dates the]{.mark}]{.underline}
Non-Proliferation Treaty (**[[NPT]{.underline}]{.mark}**),
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[explicitly disallows]{.mark} any
[transfer of nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** from a nuclear
weapon state [[to a]{.underline} **[non-nuclear]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[weapon [state]{.mark}]{.underline}**, thus **[[undermining]{.mark}
the spirit of [the treaty]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This new nuclear
bomb]{.underline} -- the B61-12 -- is intended to [replace]{.underline}
all its [older versions and]{.underline} be able to [destroy more
targets than previous models]{.underline}. It is touted by the nuclear
laboratories as an "all-in-one" bomb, a "smart" bomb, that does not
simply get tossed out of an aircraft, but can be guided and hit its
target with great precision using exactly the right amount of explosive
strength to only destroy what needs to be destroyed. Sound good? Not to
us -- [[a guided]{.mark} nuclear bomb with **[mini-nuke]{.mark}
capability** [could]{.mark}]{.underline} well **[[lower the threshold
for use]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And [the use of any kind of nuclear
weapon would lead to the use of more nuclear weapons]{.underline} --
this we know from the policies and planning of all nuclear weapon
states. It has already been well established by three evidence-based
conferences in recent years on the humanitarian impact of nuclear
weapons that any use of nuclear weapons would have catastrophic
humanitarian consequences. This new "magic bomb" is not yet with us. It
is still being developed and is planned to be deployed in five years
time, if there are no more delays. The development of the B61-12 --
euphemistically called a "Life Extension Programme" although it is a
full redesign not just an update -- has fortunately taken longer than
intended, giving us more time to convince European leaders what a bad
idea it is to deploy new nuclear weapons in Europe. **[The debate is
already under way]{.underline}** [in the "host" countries]{.underline},
most prominently in the Netherlands where the parliament has already
voted not to task the new F35 aircraft with a nuclear role. However, the
Dutch government is not listening. The German Bundestag voted in 2010 to
get rid of the B61, and the government was nominally in favour, but
after the change of government in 2013, Foreign Minister Steinmeier put
the decision on ice, quoting the new security situation. Yet
[the]{.underline} current [**[confrontation between NATO and
Russia]{.underline}** [needs]{.underline}
**[deescalation]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[not]{.underline}
**[rearmament]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[Sending a signal]{.mark} to
Russia [that NATO is]{.mark}]{.underline} modernising its European
infrastructure and [[deploying new high-tech bombs is bound to **elicit
a reaction**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even as we write, reports are coming
in that **[[Russia will respond by withdrawing from the
INF]{.mark}-Treaty]{.underline}**, basing SS-26/Iskander missiles in
Kaliningrad (didn\'t they already do that?) [[and targeting
Germany]{.mark} with nuclear weapons]{.underline}. [And what will be the
NATO response]{.underline} to all of those threats? [When will this
escalation become hysteria and the first 'shot across the bows' start a
**nuclear war**]{.underline}? Nuclear deterrence is the archetypal
security dilemma. You have to keep threatening to use nuclear weapons to
make it work. And the more you threaten, the more likely it is that they
will be used. This is the moment where nuclear weapon-free countries
need to call out for a ban on nuclear weapons to stop this madness. It
is also the right time for nuclear co-dependents, like Germany, to make
up its mind to give its nuclear dependency up. **[[Deploying new nuclear
weapons is forbidden by the NPT]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[which
obligates]{.mark} its [members to **end the arms
race**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The transfer of nuclear weapons]{.mark}
from the US to Germany]{.underline} and any plans to do so also
**[[undermine the NPT]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As a responsible member
state of this important treaty, it is time to denounce nuclear weapons
and to join the international community of nuclear weapon-free countries
that is signing the 'Humanitarian Pledge', calling for the legal gap to
prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons to be closed. Time for Germany to
show some real leadership for nuclear disarmament.

#### Removing TNWs solves the next NPT RevCon

**Sauer 17**---Tom Sauer, associate professor in international politics
at the Antwerp University ("Crossroads: Why the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty Could Become Obsolete." *National Interest*, December 8^th^,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/crossroads-why-the-nuclear-nonproliferation-treaty-could-23576)

[[There is]{.underline}]{.mark} even **[[a]{.mark} much [shorter
deadline]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [namely **[2020]{.mark}**]{.underline}
when the next Nonproliferation Treaty Review Conference will take place.
**[That review]{.underline}** conference in all likelihood **[will
fail]{.underline}**, [and that has not much to do with the **Ban
Treaty**]{.underline}. Except if the nuclear-weapon states get their act
together and move quickly, the nonnuclear-weapon states will simply make
the review conference fail. That means that for the first time two
successive review conference fail. This will undoubtedly further
undermine the remaining strength and legitimacy of the NPT, which is
already under heavy attack. **[[It is up to]{.mark} the biggest
[defenders of the NPT]{.mark}]{.underline}** for the moment---namely the
nuclear-weapon states and their allies---[[to make the
next]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[rev]{.underline}]{.mark}**iew
**[[con]{.underline}]{.mark}**ference [[successful]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[The only chance]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to convince]{.underline} the
[nonnuclear]{.underline}-weapon [states that the NPT is
worthwhile]{.underline} to keep [[is to show]{.mark} them
that]{.underline} the nuclear **[[disarmament obligations
are]{.underline}]{.mark}** taken **[[serious]{.underline}]{.mark}** by
the nuclear-weapon states. [[That can be done in]{.mark} different
ways]{.underline}: in the form of further deep cuts, a public
announcement to halt the planned modernization programs, **[[the
withdrawal of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[t]{.underline}]{.mark}**actical **[[n]{.underline}]{.mark}**uclear
**[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**eapons **[[from
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a fundamental change in declaratory
policy (e.g. binding negative security guarantees, or no first use
declarations), and/or substantial changes in operational policies (such
as de-alerting), either unilaterally or multilaterally, ideally in a
verified way. To be clear: we are not talking about minor steps such as
the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban-Treaty, the
start of negotiations for a fissile material cut-off, let alone an
extension of the existing glossary of nuclear-disarmament-related
concepts. Substantial changes are demanded at this stage. If not much of
this ambitious agenda will be realized or promised before 2020, the odds
are that the next NPT Review Conference will be a complete failure, just
like in 2005 and in 2015.

### TNWs Bad\-\--Crisis Escalation\-\--2NC

#### The impact turn structurally outweighs the aff. Removing nukes from Europe caps the [only plausible risk]{.underline} of [nuclear escalation]{.underline} with Russia, which solves the case---the alternative to withdrawing European nuclear bases is [highly dangerous]{.underline} new nuclear weapons that drive [crisis instability]{.underline}.

**Wolfsthal 17**---Jon Wolfsthal, senior advisor to Global Zero, a
non-resident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
and the former Special Assistant to President Obama for Arms Control and
Nonproliferation ("Say No to New, Smaller Nuclear Weapons," *War on the
Rocks*, November 22^nd^,
https://warontherocks.com/2017/11/say-no-new-smaller-nuclear-weapons/)

Now, as the Trump administration develops its Nuclear Posture Review,
**[the temptation of [small nuclear weapons]{.mark} is
back]{.underline}**. The review will try to lay out for the American
public and the world President Donald Trump's views on what American
nuclear weapons are for, when they might be used, and what kinds of and
how many weapons are needed to carry out U.S. strategy. Some respected
analysts and nuclear experts have suggested that the review once again
consider the pursuit of new, smaller, and more usable nuclear weapons,
despite the dangerous experiences with small nuclear weapons in the past
and the fact that the United States already has a number of these
weapons. These experts, increasingly and understandably concerned about
Russia's nuclear doctrine and its large deployments of tactical nuclear
weapons, argue that the United States should enhance deterrence by
threatening to use its own smaller nuclear weapons, and to make those
threats more credible by building more of these weapons. The thinking is
that this buildup will make adversaries believe the United States is
more likely to use nuclear weapons, thus reducing the prospects of
nuclear use altogether -- an admittedly worthy goal. While concerns
about Russia's threats are valid, [new nuclear weapons]{.underline} are
not the answer and [[carry]{.mark} with them]{.underline}
**[[significant risks]{.mark} and costs]{.underline}** [that
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [must
avoid]{.underline}. Smaller, **[more [usable nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** [will [**do little** to alter
adversaries' calculations]{.mark} or make the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [more successful in a
war]{.underline}, [and they make America less safe by **[increasing
crisis instability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[between the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. While the specific circumstances may be
new, the debate over small nuclear weapons is not. From the effort to
develop high-radiation, low-blast neutron bombs in the 1970s to the
"flexible response" doctrine that led the United States to produce
thousands of tactical nuclear weapons, we have had these debates before.
But for all the current discussions and analysis, [there is no evidence
that Russia's]{.underline} or North Korea's [willingness to consider
first]{.underline} nuclear [use is based on the credibility or the size
of America's deterrent]{.underline}. There is, however, a wealth of
evidence, ranging from public statements and diplomatic engagement, that
**[Moscow]{.underline}** and Pyongyang **[threaten]{.underline}**
nuclear **[first use]{.underline}** [to compensate for]{.underline}
their **[conventional inferiority]{.underline}**. [They know they would
**lose any prolonged conventional conflict**]{.underline} with the
United States and its allies. Their plans to use nuclear weapons in a
conflict are designed to either produce a frozen conflict -- akin to
Ukraine -- or to prevent the United States from bringing reinforcements
to the battlefield in defense of its allies. [[Increasing the range of
nuclear response]{.mark} options available to the United States will
have no bearing on these countries' fundamental concerns, and [won't
change]{.mark} their [willingness to consider]{.mark} the [early
use]{.mark} of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Moreover, **[[lowering
America's]{.underline}]{.mark}** own **[[threshold]{.mark} for nuclear
use]{.underline}** [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} further [erode stability
and [increase the likelihood of]{.mark} the kind of conflict that might
**lead to [nuclear use]{.mark}** by enemies]{.underline}. The hard
reality of America's conventional military superiority is that
regardless of its nuclear capabilities and even use, adversaries losing
a conventional war with the United States may resort to nuclear use.
General debates are interesting, but specific scenarios are instructive.
John Harvey's recent article for War on the Rocks posits a hypothetical
situation in which Russia, facing conventional defeat in a conflict with
the United States and NATO, uses a small nuclear weapon to attack an
airfield in a Baltic state, hoping to block America's ability to bring
forces to the battle. [If the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [develops new weapons, and chooses to use them
despite having **conventional alternatives**]{.underline}, [it is worth
considering how these weapons might be employed]{.underline}. [One
option might be]{.underline} for Washington [to counter-attack the
Russian base where the nuclear strike originated as
punishment]{.underline}. **[[This would require NATO to conduct a
nuclear strike against]{.underline}]{.mark}** Kaliningrad or
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** proper. [The size of the
weapon]{.underline} the United States used [would not
matter]{.underline}: [[Russia's leaders would]{.underline}]{.mark}
likely [[view the strike as a **major escalation**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and would be **under pressure**]{.underline} [to respond in kind
against the U.S. homeland]{.underline}. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}
course of action [[threatens]{.mark} to trigger a **[massive
escalation]{.mark} of a regional conflict**]{.underline} [and must be
avoided]{.underline}, especially since America could still prosecute the
war and defeat Russian aggression conventionally. [Another
response]{.underline} option for the United States and NATO [might be to
use nuclear weapons in the **European theater**]{.underline}, perhaps
[against Russian troops in the Baltics or a third country]{.underline},
although it is not clear what military advantage that would bring. [In
this scenario the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [would be using nuclear weapons on the
**territory of sovereign European states**]{.underline}, possibly even
one of its own allies. [This would hardly enhance alliance cohesion or
America's global position]{.underline} in the face of a Russian attack.
A needless nuclear response would also keep Washington from gaining
broad international support to oppose Moscow's aggression against a
sovereign European nation. Lastly, the United States can reinforce
multiple airbases throughout Europe, meaning Russia's attack would not
prevent its eventual defeat by conventional means. The reality is that
short of an all-out nuclear war, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[does not need
nuclear weapons]{.underline}** [to defeat Russia]{.underline}. Smaller
weapons are no more usable or relevant than large ones in a regional
conflict where Russia has used such weapons itself. [In the most likely
scenarios, Russia has already attacked a NATO member]{.underline} ---
either because of miscalculation or as part of a new attempt to use
hybrid warfare to undermine states on its periphery. [Either Russia has
assumed the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates will not protect its NATO interests (a fatally
flawed assumption) or events have overwhelmed rational efforts to avoid
a military confrontation. Harvey's concern that the United States should
take effective steps to deter Russia from ever getting to this point are
valid. But **[conventional deterrence]{.underline}** and close alliance
coordination [are the proven remedies]{.underline} to such threats ---
newer **[[small nuclear weapons won't prevent leaders from making bad
choices]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They did not stop Putin from invading
Ukraine, for example, though Kiev is not covered by U.S. nuclear
guarantees. Regardless, [building [a small nuclear]{.mark} silver
[bullet]{.mark} to deter potential Russian use]{.underline} is unlikely
to prevent the outbreak of such hostilities, and
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} instead **[[increase the risks of
accidental]{.mark} or unintended [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. So
new, small nuclear weapons don't obviously enhance deterrence or bring
any real military utility. We should also consider how Russia and other
states would respond to a decision by the Trump administration to pursue
**[[new weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It [will [give Russia, China,
North Korea, and others]{.mark} easy political [cover to continue
their]{.mark} own [programs]{.mark}]{.underline}. They will likely do so
anyway, but [why should the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [legitimize these countries' pursuit of such
policies if doing so brings no military or deterrent
advantage]{.underline}? Some American allies will also view pursuit of
new nuclear capabilities as an admission that Washington doubts its own
conventional superiority. Otherwise, why would it need to enhance its
position with new nuclear options? Sowing doubt among allies about
America's commitment to defend them will bolster the case within these
countries that they need their own nuclear deterrents.

#### TNWs increase the risk of all-out nuclear escalation

[The return of]{.underline} **[tactical weapons]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} the most [controversial]{.underline} aspect of Trump's
Nuclear Posture Review. [[The]{.mark} new [policy
assumes]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[American tactical weapons]{.mark}
will [deter]{.mark}]{.underline} the use of [[Russian tactical
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, raising "the nuclear threshold" and making
"nuclear employment less likely." Sam **[[Nunn]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a
former chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services and a
co-founder of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, has **[argued against
that]{.underline}** sort of thinking for more than forty years. [He
[fears]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[the **chance of
accidents**]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[[miscalculations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and]{.underline}
**[blunders]{.underline}** [[with tactical
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}---[as well as [the **pressure to
"use**]{.mark} **them [or lose them]{.mark}"**]{.underline} in
battle---[greatly [increase the risk of]{.mark} an **[all-out nuclear
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Like so many of the disagreements about
nuclear strategy, this one cannot be settled with empirical evidence,
and [selecting [the]{.mark} wrong [policy could be
**catastrophic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Nunn observed in 1974, after a
tour of NATO's tactical nuclear units, "Nobody has any experience in
fighting nuclear wars, and nobody knows what would happen if one were to
start."

**[SECURITY RISKS OF THE POSTURE]{.underline}**

At each of [[the]{.mark} U.S. and NATO air [bases that]{.mark} are
thought to [store]{.mark} U.S. [nuclear weapons in
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}, a combined force of U.S. and European NATO
personnel is assigned to retain custody and provide security of U.S.
nuclear weapons. The weapons are stored in underground, hardened storage
vaults inside protective aircraft shelters at each storage base.
Custody, repair, and improvements to the weapons and the storage vaults
are the responsibility of the U.S. Air Force. Perimeter security
(fences, monitors, and motion detectors) and controlling access to the
storage sites are the responsibility of the host nation. These sites
[**[present targets]{.mark}** and opportunities [for]{.mark} both
insiders and outside [groups to disrupt or gain access to]{.mark} the
facilities and, potentially, the **[weapons]{.mark}**
themselves]{.underline}. [In 2009 and 2010]{.underline}, an incident
occurred that underlines this point. [A group of activists entered a
suspected NATO storage site in Belgium and walked freely for more than
an hour before being detained by base security]{.underline}.18 More
recent events have led to increasing concerns regarding the security of
NATO bases and European nuclear facilities. The aftermath of the
Brussels terrorist attacks in March 2016 revealed what appears to have
been a credible threat to Belgian nuclear power plants.19 [At about the
same time as the Brussels attacks, [the Pentagon ordered military
families out]{.mark} of southern Turkey, including the Incirlik Air
Base, **[because of ISIS]{.mark}** related security
[concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}.20 Then, in July 2016, following an
attempted coup to topple the Turkish government, the Turkish commanding
officer at Incirlik was arrested for his alleged role in the plot. [If
reports are accurate---that Incirlik is a major NATO installation
hosting U.S. forces that control one of the largest stockpiles of
nuclear weapons in Europe]{.underline} (see Chapter 5)---**[[this event
shows]{.mark} just how quickly assumptions about [the safety]{.mark} and
security [of]{.mark} U.S. [nuclear weapons]{.mark} stored abroad [can
change]{.mark}]{.underline}**.21 [Continued political
instability]{.underline} over the past year, including mass arrests
within Turkey and tensions between Turkey and the United States and
NATO, [are less than reassuring]{.underline}. [Even before these events,
[deficiencies in]{.mark} the [security]{.mark} of U.S. nuclear weapons
stored in Europe [were cited in]{.mark} a [2008]{.mark} study by the
U.S. Air Force, which concluded that [most sites]{.mark} in Europe
"[require additional resources]{.mark} to meet]{.underline}
\[[U.S.]{.underline} **[D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[D]{.underline}**efense\] [standards," [and]{.mark} [found]{.mark}
"[inconsistencies in personnel]{.mark} facilities [and equipment]{.mark}
provided to the security mission by the host nation]{.underline}."22 A
former senior NATO official, retired U.S. Air Force Major General
Robertus Remkes, who commanded the 39th Wing at Incirlik Air Base and
later J5 United States European Command, wrote in 2011 of the ongoing
security risks associated with storing U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe
and the severity of the political and security consequences for NATO of
any infiltration of a site, whether or not the attackers gained access
to the weapons themselves.23 Although the United States and NATO have
undertaken considerable efforts to improve the physical security of
nuclear weapons stored in Europe since the U.S. Air Force study, it
should be assumed that [[those weapons remain]{.mark} potential [targets
for terrorist attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Storing nuclear
weapons]{.mark} at locations [throughout Europe]{.mark} to reassure some
allies or as leverage in a future arms control deal with
Russia,]{.underline} therefore, [[comes with]{.mark} the
[increasing]{.mark} risk of **[vulnerability to]{.mark}** an evolving
and **[deadlier terrorist threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} [(in contrast,
nuclear weapons in the continental]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [are secured in central storage facilities that
are easier to protect]{.underline} than dispersed underground vaults
inside aircraft shelters across multiple bases in Europe). Russia, too,
may be vulnerable, with an estimated 1,850 non-strategic nuclear weapons
reportedly kept in central storage facilities throughout the country.24

### EU Army\-\--1NC

#### Ukraine provides a brink for creation of an EU Army, but reliance on NATO stops development. EU Army deters Russia, increases responsiveness to crises, and establishes independence from the US.

**Herr and Speer 22**\*Fellow and Consultant at the Charlemagne Prize
Academy, Vincent-Immanuel\*\* Fellow and Consultant at the Charlemagne
Prize Academy, Martin(5-18-22, "The European Union Needs Its Own Army"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/05/18/european-union-army-ukraine/)HS

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has forced leaders of the European Union
to confront an uncomfortable reality: Europeans have neglected their own
security for far too long. Europe has for decades been content to be a
soft-power superpower]{.underline} --- focusing on peacekeeping,
democracy and prosperity within the union. It has been all [too
comfortable delegating its security concerns to the United States, which
provides military cover through its NATO commitment.]{.underline}

Now, in response to the war to its east, [the E.U. has shifted gears
---]{.underline} unanimously approving crippling sanctions on Russia,
providing weapons and humanitarian support to Ukraine, and in several
cases [announcing significant expansions of national defense budgets. It
is unclear, however, whether this welcome taking-up of responsibilities
will extend to larger reforms of Europe's notoriously fragmented and
uncoordinated military structures, which contribute to the continent's
lack of military potency.]{.underline}

In March, for instance, the [E.U. announced that it was authorizing the
creation of a 5,000-person "rapid deployment" force, independent of
NATO]{.underline} (a move in the works well before the Ukraine
conflict). But in discussing that development, the E.U.\'s high
representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, was quick to [rule
out any bolder moves: "We do not want to create a European
army,"]{.underline} he said. "It is not about creating a European army."
But the gravity of the situation in Eastern Europe makes it clearer than
ever [that is precisely what should happen. Establishing an E.U.
military would not only provide important protection from aggression of
the sort on display in Ukraine; it would also be a logical next step in
European integration.]{.underline}

First, and most important, [establishing an E.U. military would
provid]{.underline}e a degree of [security independence from the United
States --- all the more important, given recent political trends in
America. Overreliance on American protection has had catastrophic
effects on E.U. security.]{.underline} IRIS, a French think tank, put
the point with brutal honesty in a 2020 study: "The European Union is
incapable of protecting its citizens or protecting itself as a political
unit," it said, "and even less able to defend itself as a geopolitical
actor." Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, then Germany's defense minister,
made a similar argument the same year: "[Without America's nuclear and
conventional capabilities, Germany and Europe cannot protect
themselves.]{.underline} Those are the plain facts." And those
assessments remain true two years later. [When Russian President
Vladimir Putin ordered the move into Ukraine, he did not seem impressed
or concerned with the military forces of the E.U.]{.underline} nations,
many strategists noted; he [was concerned mostly about American
might]{.underline}. Even full-fledged EU members like [Finland and
Sweden are now upending decades of military non-alignment and seeking to
join NATO, recognizing that E.U. membership alone does not provide
enough protection from Russian aggression]{.underline}.

President [Donald Trump's disdain for NATO was clear:]{.underline} He
even [reportedly discussed with aides withdrawing from the
alliance]{.underline}. Under President Biden, the United States has
reassured partners in Europe and beyond of its commitment to them. But
Trump's example demonstrated to Europe --- or ought to have --- that
[the ability to rely on the United States may now vary from presidential
election to presidential election.]{.underline} And not all of America's
inattention toward Europe can be blamed on Trump. Before Ukraine
erupted, the [Biden administration had made clear its desire to shift
U.S. focus to China and the Indo-Pacific.]{.underline} Given this state
of affairs, the [E.U.'s]{.underline} union of liberal democracies [would
be wise to dramatically increase its military effectiveness as it
contends with an imperial Russia, an expanding Chinese superpower, and
destabilized African and Middle Eastern neighbors.]{.underline}

The second argument concerns efficiency. Currently, the 27 member states
of the E.U. can field an impressive 1.3 million active-duty military
personnel, roughly on par with the size of the U.S. armed forces
(approximately 1.4 million) and significantly bigger than Russia's
military (850,000). The [combined military expenditure of the E.U.
states is an impressive \$225 billion]{.underline}, more than twice the
size of Russia's military budget of a little over \$100 billion and
roughly three-quarters of China's \$290 billion. Yet these numbers do
not translate to effectiveness. In fact, the [planning, development and
procurement of defense technology by 27 sovereign countries has produced
an enormous amount of inefficiency.]{.underline} While the U.S. military
uses just 30 weapons systems, the E.U.'s militaries use some 180, six
times as many. While the U.S. armed forces use just one main battle
tank, the E.U. fields --- depending how you count --- 11 to 17 different
models. Pointing to facts like these, then-European Commission President
Jean-Claude Juncker suggested, "We are spending half of the American
budget when it comes to defense, so we should be efficient at 50 percent
of the U.S. We are only 15 percent as efficient." [Integrating European
militaries --- and centralizing the procurement and development of
technology --- would doubtlessly increase E.U. military, budgetary and
personnel efficiency.]{.underline}

The [third argument concerns responsiveness.]{.underline} When the
Afghan government collapsed last summer, NATO states scrambled to get
their citizens and Afghan allies out of the country. Only the quick and
determined deployment of some 6,000 U.S. troops prevented an already
catastrophic situation from becoming even worse. And while some European
countries sent their own small troop contingents to evacuate citizens,
Europeans largely acknowledged their inability to run such an operation
on their own. This assessment was shared by Secretary of State Antony
Blinken, who remarked, "Only the United States could organize and
execute a mission of this scale and this complexity." Such emergencies
are sadly likely to recur, so the [E.U. would do well to increase its
own capabilities for rapid response on a large scale. While the
5,000-member rapid-response force should help, its modest size will
immediately limit its potential use. Only a larger E.U. military under a
centralized command could provide both the numbers to react to a variety
of threats and the logistics for quick deployment and resupply on the
ground.]{.underline}

The last argument concerns the development of a European identity. The
E.U. prides itself on its diversity of languages, cultures and
histories. This heterogeneity does come at a price, though. Most E.U.
citizens define themselves by their country of birth first; few consider
themselves Europeans primarily. What's more, roughly 40 percent of E.U.
citizens have never left their home country. The E.U. military could
foster the formation of a European consciousness, a necessary condition
for a more confident European stance in geopolitics. This would
especially be true if there were a period of mandatory service ---
perhaps six to nine months --- for citizens ages 17 to 26. (Many E.U.
countries had mandatory military service of some kind during the Cold
War.) Such service could take a decidedly European approach: Women and
men, after their schooling is complete, could choose to perform their
service either as civilians --- for example in hospitals, kindergartens
or nongovernmental organizations --- or as soldiers in the E.U. armed
forces. Either way, deployment (civilian or military) beyond one's
native country should be encouraged.

How would such a force be administered? It would be a challenge, but we
propose that the E.U. military be overseen by a new E.U. foreign and
security council (composed of members of the Council of the European
Union and the European Parliament, and headed by a new commissioner for
defense). This body would have to unanimously agree to any deployment of
E.U. soldiers abroad.

However, an attack on any one or multiple E.U. member states should
automatically activate the armed forces for defensive operations. To
further assure its members, the E.U. could enshrine this automatic
mechanism by updating the E.U. Treaty's Article 42.7, which currently
calls somewhat vaguely for a mutual "obligation of aid and assistance"
in case of an attack. The E.U. armed forces would thus become the bloc's
first line of defense.

Initially the armed forces could be a separate, 28th military in the
E.U. (as others have proposed), supplementing the 27 national armed
forces. Over time, it could take on more and more of the duties of those
forces (in the long run, perhaps all of them). In the early stages, the
force would focus primarily on securing the bloc's eastern border and on
crisis interventions.

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} --- and the cruel and
inhumane way it is waging this war of aggression --- [has laid bare the
shortcomings of E.U. foreign and security policy. The E.U. response to
this crisis must match its gravity.]{.underline} While the first chapter
of European integration centered on securing peace and prosperity
internally, the next chapter [should build up the capability to defend
against external threats. An E.U. military could transform the union
from a dependent soft power into a sovereign superpower of global
relevance]{.underline}. In the words of E.U. Commission President Ursula
von der Leyen back in 2018, when she was Germany's minister of defense:
"The time is ripe for an army of Europeans committed to peace on our
continent and in the world. Deeds must now follow words."

### EU Army\-\--2NC

#### Europe has the means for an EU Army but NATO security guarantees prevent support on both sides of the Atlantic

**Bandow 21** Senior fellow at the Cato Institute, specializing in
foreign policy and civil liberties. He worked as special assistant to
President *RoNaLd rEaGaN* and editor of the political magazine Inquiry,
Doug(9-16-21 "Operation Go It Alone: Disenchanted [Europeans May Build
Their Own Army",]{.underline} Cato Institute,
cato.org/commentary/operation-go-it-alone-disenchanted-europeans-may-build-their-own-army)HS

[**Europeans are a moody lot.** Whenever they feel neglected by America
--- meaning most anytime Washington is busy elsewhere --- there is much
wailing and gnashing of teeth]{.underline}. And endless demands for
"reassurance," as in additional promises to spend and do even more to
defend the continent.

European unease again is on the rise. President Joe Biden's chaotic
Afghanistan withdrawal allegedly without even the pretense of
consultation hit Europe particularly hard. There were charges that Biden
didn't coordinate with European governments, which had sizable groups of
military personnel and civilians in Afghanistan (The NATO chief denies
the alliance wasn't consulted). It would seem that the continental
states have more reason than usual to be upset.

While brickbats tossed Washington's way aren't likely to have much
effect, Europe's impotence has spurred renewed interest in expanding the
continent's military capabilities, which could become the most
significant consequence of Europe's involvement in Washington's 20‐​year
Afghan misadventure.

When European defense ministers gathered in late August, their meeting
was filled with complaints of a "fiasco" and "debacle." They were
frustrated that they had no ability to act independently but had to rely
on America. Of course, none of this should have been a surprise. French
President Emmanuel Macron previously called NATO "brain dead," promoted
"strategic autonomy," and advocated a "true European army," with no
result. Grandiose ideas of an independent European military force have
long circulated to no end. More than two decades ago plans were actually
made for a 60,000 multinational force, which never appeared. Nor did
later proposals for 1500‐​member "battle groups."

Now Josep Borrell, the European Union's de facto foreign minister, wants
to establish an "initial entry force" of about 5,000 soldiers. He
complained: "We Europeans found ourselves --- not only for the
evacuations out of the Kabul airport but also more broadly --- depending
on American decisions." The Afghanistan experience was particularly
painful, he observed, showing "that the deficiencies in our strategic
autonomy come with a price." He advocated "new tools like this entry
force," so "The only way forward is to combine our forces and strengthen
our capacity and our will to act."

[With an equivalent combined economy and larger population than America,
Europe has long had the resources necessary to create such a unit.
However, the will was always lacking,]{.underline} even for what would
be small ball for America. Has that finally changed?

Significant barriers to action remain. Historically, [Washington opposed
such an independent European force. U.S. officials feared that separate
units would cause penurious Europeans to reduce resources available to
NATO.]{.underline} Moreover, [past administrations worried that the
continent would move toward a more independent foreign and military
policy]{.underline}, which is anathema to Washington. [The U.S. wants
Europe to do more, but only under the former's control.]{.underline}

Nor has the continent shown any interest in doing more. Despite modest
growth in military outlays by a number of European states since 2014,
the continent continues to badly lag America's effort. In a pitifully
honest self‐​review, German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp‐​Karrenbauer
admitted that "Without America's nuclear and conventional capabilities,
Germany and Europe cannot protect themselves." She cited estimates that
"the United States currently provides 75 percent of all NATO
capabilities."

Only France and the United Kingdom possess capable armed forces of
serious size. Germany, Italy, and Spain have sizeable economies but
minimal militaries, in theoretical and practical strength. Indeed, the
poor readiness of the Bundeswehr, the heir to the once mighty Wehrmacht,
would be comical if not so serious. Even countries which claim to fear
Russian revanchism, most notably the three Baltic states and Poland,
spend little more than 2 percent of GDP, a miserly investment on behalf
of their freedom. In the field, noted Rem Korteweg of the Dutch
Clingendael Institute, Bosnia and Libya demonstrated "the inability of
Europeans to do anything serious without the Americans."

Although most European leaders formally assent to NATO insistence that
they spend more, there is no public support for doing so. Most Europeans
do not fear Russia, the only plausible security threat. Those who do
[expect Washington to shield them. That is why the eastern‐​most members
of NATO want the presence of an American military tripwire]{.underline},
to ensure U.S. [deaths (not theirs) and trigger automatic American
involvement in war on their behalf if attacked by Moscow. Fear of U.S.
disengagement might cause more European countries to spend more on their
militaries, but so far no one expects the American military to go home.
As long as Washington's security guarantee appears secure, few European
nations are likely to make an added investment in a European "initial
entry force."]{.underline}

Indeed, [Europeans do not support going to war for their neighbors even
while expecting Americans to go to war for them.]{.underline} Last year
the Pew Research Center surveyed 14 NATO members. In Poland, which
constantly demands more U.S. attention, only 40 percent of respondents
agreed that "our country should use military force" in response to a
Russian attack on a NATO ally. Just a third in Germany, which was loaded
with allied troops during the Cold War. And a quarter in Greece and
Italy. Although many governments are more supportive of NATO and
military outlays than their publics, at a time of economic difficulty
and fiscal stringency they are more likely to curb than expand spending
on the armed forces.

President [Biden should strongly support European efforts to create more
effective militaries, however they are organized]{.underline}. Indeed,
he should go further and encourage the continent to move toward military
independence.

#### Ukraine solves political and military will, but NATO's security guarantee prevents development

**Graziano and Braw 22** \*Chairman of the EU Military Committee, Former
Commander of the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon, Claudio
\*\*Member of the United Kingdom National Preparedness Commission,
Elisabeth(3-20-22, \"Is an EU Army Coming?,\" Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/>20 22/03/20/is-an-eu-army-coming/)HS

The [war in Ukraine]{.underline}, politicians and pundits agree, [is the
European Union's]{.underline} sudden [birth as a serious military
player. Germany]{.underline} has announced that it [will dramatically
increase its defense spending and is sending weapons to
Ukraine]{.underline}---a previously unthinkable development. The
European Union, heretofore mostly known as an outfit that voices
concerns about military aggression but does nothing, has already sent
Ukraine military aid worth more than half a billion dollars.

[But what exactly the EU's military role should be remains painfully
unclear]{.underline}: Member states have widely different opinions on
the matter, and [European security is of course already being looked
after by NATO. What, exactly, can the EU do to grow its military muscle
without causing affront to its Brussels neighbor]{.underline}? Severe
crises below NATO's Article 5 threshold, in a way, pose an opportunity
for the EU to make a real military contribution. Its Military
Committee---composed of member states' defense chiefs---has the daunting
task of mapping a course. At the center sits its chair, Gen. Claudio
Graziano.

Graziano, who spent the first part of his career within Italy's elite
Alpini mountain infantry, was previously Italy's chief of defense and
chief of the army. He also served in Afghanistan as commander of the
Kabul Multinational Brigade and commanded the United Nations'
peacekeeping mission in Lebanon. He assumed his EU post in 2018 after
being elected by his fellow EU defense chiefs. The following interview
has been edited for length and clarity.

Elisabeth Braw: The EU has suddenly emerged as a serious actor in the
security of Europe, and EU governments are increasing defense spending.
[Is the EU militarily stronger now than it was two months
ago?]{.underline}

Claudio Graziano: [Absolutely yes. Russia has brought war back to
Europe]{.underline}, which was something so serious and dangerous that
it wasn't even considered possible. Even for people who had read about
the risk, it was impossible to believe it would happen. When it did
happen, [it was a shock of immense magnitude that provoked a huge common
response from the European Union.]{.underline}

["A defense union is really the only possible answer to this
crisis."]{.underline}

At the Versailles meeting \[on March 10-11\], the heads of state and
government discussed how the European Union can live up to its
responsibilities in this new reality. [Doing so requires a clear
political will, and now the European Union is more united than ever.
This gives an incredible push to building a more concrete and credible
European defense union.]{.underline} And [a defense union is really the
only possible answer to this crisis.]{.underline}

We know [that's a long path, but we know that we have to do it now
because later will be too late.]{.underline} As part of this effort,
we'll start developing an EU Rapid Deployment Capacity that will give us
the chance to deploy a modular and multidomain force of up to 5,000
troops that can intervene in nonpermissive \[hostile\] environments.

This force will also have strategic enablers that have in the past
normally been provided by the United States---for example, command and
control structures, strategic airlift, strategic transport, intelligence
surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, cyberdefense, unmanned air
vehicles, space communication assets, electronic warfare systems,
anti-missile defense, and I hope in the near future main battle tanks
and next-generation fighter jets.

EB: But the [EU already has battlegroups]{.underline} [that have never
been deployed]{.underline}. How can you be sure that this deployable
force will be successful when the battlegroups have not?

CG: The EU battlegroups are designed to be used for stabilization
management \[crises less severe than war\], and it's true that they've
never been used. That's because we never reached an agreement among the
EU member states on certain issues, such as cost and who was supposed to
lead the effort. The other [complication was that they shouldn't compete
with NATO.]{.underline} In the past, I served in NATO missions for many
years, including in Afghanistan, and NATO does foreign deployments well.
It also has at least nine rapid reaction corps, and they're much bigger
than the EU battlegroups. Our new EU Rapid Deployment Capacity is an
effort to answer a security need without competing with NATO. But to be
a real answer, the Deployment Capacity must also be used in exercises.
And having it on the roster will send a message of European unity to
Russia and others.

EB: Speaking of unity, Poland wants to give Ukraine its MiG-29 fighter
jets but doesn't want this to be just a Polish initiative. The United
States said no because it didn't want to be drawn into the war in the
active way that sending aircraft from Ramstein Air Base in Germany would
mean. Can the EU step in to help Ukraine now?

CG: The provision of combat aircraft is currently not on the agenda. But
you have to remember that on Feb. 27, only 72 hours after Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, the EU adopted an unprecedented aid package to help
the Ukrainian armed forces defend Ukraine's territory and population.
This aid package included lethal weapons. That's a milestone! It's even
more than a historical moment. Remember that in 2013 we weren't able to
provide anything to Mali. \[Editor's note: Despite having monitored the
2012 Islamist takeover of the country's north closely, the EU failed to
intervene militarily. Instead, France launched an intervention in which
it was assisted by Germany, Denmark, and other EU member states.\]

Regarding lethal weapons, we're sending whatever the Ukrainians need
most---for example, ammunition and anti-tank weapons. This will help the
Ukrainians fight for freedom, and their will to do so is the most
important surprise in this war. Neither the Russians nor we probably
understood how far the Ukrainians would go to defend their freedom. It's
so different from Afghanistan this past summer, when we saw the Afghan
armed forces melt away.

EB: What is your own role in this growing military role the EU is taking
on? Does the Ukrainian government come to you directly with requests for
military assistance?

CG: It works a bit differently. The Ukrainians tell us what they need,
the EU member states check what they have and can give to the
Ukrainians, and we---through the EU military staff ---function as the
clearinghouse.

EB: One idea that keeps being floated in every discussion about the EU
and its military capabilities is the prospect of an EU Army. It's
clearly not feasible, especially considering that it has taken Germany
and the Netherlands years of painstaking work to establish their joint
panzer division. Short of complete military integration, what can the EU
do to strengthen its military capabilities, beyond increasing defense
spending, of course? As we know, countries like to spend money on
weapons made by their own companies.

CG: Integrating armed forces really is extremely difficult, but it's not
impossible. It starts with the political will. But what we can do first
to strengthen our military capabilities is to improve interoperability.
After this war, we need to conclude that life won't be as it was before
and that we've made a backward leap of at least 70 years.

How do we improve interoperability? Consider this: The U.S. Army, and
even the Russian army, uses only one type of main battle tank. We
Europeans operate 17 different kinds. That creates enormous problems of
maintenance and supply and of training together. Our navies and air
forces have similar problems. We're talking about a total of 180
different platforms, while the United States has 30. This really is
anachronistic and unacceptable, especially considering that we
collectively spend more than 250 billion euros \[about \$276 billion\] a
year on defense, which is much more than what Russia spends. Yes, we
need to spend more, but we also need to spend better by avoiding such
duplication.

And it's not just about money. We have to have a mindset that we want to
train together and work together. And when you deploy together, you
become credible. When I was a lieutenant, I was part of a NATO war group
that did exactly this; we deployed to countries on NATO's outer edges,
such as Norway and Turkey. It was a very well-trained and credible
group. Now that we're going back in history in European security, the EU
should be able to do such things, too.

EB: When will the EU be able to deploy forces?

CG: We've set ourselves the target of 2025 for the Deployment Capacity
to be fully operational. That's an ambitious term because it means you
need to have all the strategic enablers I mentioned earlier. Then again,
you have to remember that the [EU is not in charge of collective
defense. That's a NATO responsibility.]{.underline} But in the current
crisis, we---the EU---responded immediately not just by sending military
aid to Ukraine but by providing military assistance to other countries,
too. At the moment, aircraft coordinated by the EU are, for example,
flying reconnaissance missions over Bosnia and Herzegovina. That sends a
message of solidarity to the people of Bosnia and a message to malicious
actors that we're ready to react.

EB: Your fellow army general Oleksandr Sirsky, commander of the
Ukrainian ground forces, faces an unbelievably difficult task. What is
your message to him?

CG: I want to send him a message of support. Col. Gen. Sirsky is also in
charge of the defense of Kyiv, and Russian President Vladimir Putin's
original plan was to quickly capture Kyiv. Thanks to him and his troops,
that didn't happen. I want to tell him that we're on their side, we'll
remain on their side, and that he can count on us.

will]{.mark} put a **[curb]{.mark} on [its]{.mark} ability to forge
comprehensive [partnerships with third parties]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Revamping the Transatlantic Relationship The transatlantic relationship,
North America's partnership with Europe, is still the world's most vital
economic, strategic and political bond, and will remain so for the
foreseeable future. [The question is]{.underline}, however, [whether
NATO should remain its ultimate embodiment, or whether this relationship
should be **remodelled**]{.underline} and based [**on a broad and new
strategic EU-US partnership**, including provisions on security and
defence]{.underline} such as a mutual assistance clause. Such [a
**recalibrated partnership** would leave room for
**differences**]{.underline} in approach [and]{.underline} be more
informal in nature, while not necessarily always involving all 27 EU
members, but still important when crises erupt. [We have seen examples
of]{.underline} this kind of [**cooperation** on **Iran**]{.underline},
with the EU3 teaming up with the US, and the Middle East, [where the EU
sits next to the US]{.underline}A, [the UN and Russia in the
Quartet]{.underline}: both cases that do not allow for direct NATO
involvement. Good Old NATO [Critics will maintain that we cannot do
without NATO's unique capabilities]{.underline}, in terms of joint
planning and interoperability. No other organization but NATO can
conduct an operation like ISAF, the argument runs. But in many respects
ISAF is a revealing operation. What we really see in Afghanistan is an
able and willing coalition that runs the demanding southern and eastern
regional commands, and a host of other countries doing something else in
the more benign provinces. Out of ISAF's 46 contributors, **[non-NATO
member Australia seamlessly joins combat operations]{.underline}** in
the South, while NATO member Germany is carrying out its national
stabilization operation in the north, steered by the Bundestag rather
than by NATO. None of these countries would be able to sustain their
operations without US enablers[. So it is]{.underline} rather the US,
and **[not]{.underline}** necessarily [**NATO**, which is
pivotal]{.underline} within ISAF. [[Trading NATO for the EU]{.mark}-USA
does not mean doing away with the acquis atlantique, but it
[would]{.mark} mean **doing away with a top-heavy alliance**
that]{.underline} served its purpose well but increasingly **[stirs
unease in Europe]{.underline}**, while becoming less relevant to
Washington -- even if the newest US National Security Strategy routinely
speaks of NATO as the pre-eminent security alliance in the world today.
[NATO, or Europe, is nowhere as central in US security thinking as many
Europeans like to believe]{.underline}. When 9/11 occurred, invoking the
alliance's Article 5 only came as an afterthought. Paradoxically, this
trend may be reinforced under a less traditionally inclined president
Obama, no matter how enthusiastically his inauguration was celebrated in
Europe. Moreover, [building a new relationship with the US]{.underline}A
[which is **more balanced**]{.underline} than it is now [would likely
[stimulate Europe]{.mark} to further **boost its**]{.underline}
post-Second World War **[[integration]{.mark} process]{.underline}**.
Third Parties Last but not least, [a new transatlantic
partnership]{.underline} more firmly [based on both participants'
[autonomy]{.mark} would [enable]{.mark} the [EU]{.mark}]{.underline},
but also the USA, [to **review their [relations with third
parties]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Take, for example, Russia. Among other
reasons, [the EU-Russia relationship, important because of]{.underline}
the density of [trade, investment and energy]{.underline} links but
marred by endless negotiations on a new strategic agreement, [is held
back because of]{.underline} Moscow's frustration that it cannot discuss
security with the EU, which tends to refer to **[NATO]{.underline}**
instead. [As long [as Europe labels **NATO**]{.mark} **as [its]{.mark}
primary security [organization]{.mark}**[, Moscow is likely to regard
the EU]{.mark}'s neighbourhood policies [as]{.mark} [affiliated with the
**alliance's**]{.mark} **enlargement [agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline},
given the expressed synergies between these two 'EuroAtlantic
organizations'. More broadly speaking, [[the]{.mark} outside [world will
look at Europe as a **more serious interlocutor as it depends less on
US** ]{.mark}**security [guarantees]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Sticking to
the Russia example, the US, lacking the economic dimension in its
relationship with Moscow, is perfectly capable of concluding deals on
strategic issues, such as the recent START agreement on nuclear
arsenals. But many, not all, of the bilateral irritants concern Europe
and are NATO related. It is probably no coincidence that Russian
compliance with START has been made dependent on missile defence
developments in Europe.

#### East Asian, African and Latin American conflict coming now\-\--only EU can solve

Peace, Volume 5, Issue 1, January, p. 70-73

Thus, [there is a well-rehearsed commitment to the principle of peace
and by implication the peaceful resolution of disputes]{.underline}. The
bipolar world order established after the Second World War made a
mockery of this commitment. The term [[conflict
prevention]{.underline}]{.mark} in this era [[meant
**containing**]{.mark} **the [potential for nuclear war between]{.mark}
the [major blocs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [ideological
[struggle]{.mark}]{.underline} between those blocs [was [carried into
**conflict all over the globe**]{.mark}, notably [in]{.mark} **East
[Asia]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Korea and Vietnam),
**[[Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}** (the Congo and Angola) [[and **Latin
America**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Chile and Nicaragua). [The]{.underline}
international community's [response]{.underline} was generally [to
insert [peacekeeping]{.mark} forces]{.underline} between parties in
conflict [[without]{.underline}]{.mark} necessarily [[dealing
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[root causes]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
conflict. Many such conflicts [[ended with]{.underline}]{.mark} the
collapse of the Soviet Union, but [long-suppressed
[animosities]{.mark}]{.underline} between the constituent republics of
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} Union and its client states
**[[erupted]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The international community's
[failure to deal with]{.underline} the [ethnic/sectarian conflicts in
the **Caucasus** and **South Eastern Europe**]{.underline} on the one
hand and the Rwanda genocide on the other [impelled discussion of
conflict prevention]{.underline} from academia to foreign policy
formation. While the UN and the OSCE had long-standing commitments to
conflict prevention, exercise of all possible options was in practice
limited by international politics. When it became clear that, as Smith12
put it, the balance of terror of the Cold War would not be replaced by
peace and security, the issue of conflict prevention became prominent
for the international community.

3\. Current Conflict Resolution Practice

Van Waalraven13 explored the conflict policies of a sample of Western
countries (Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United
Kingdom) and found that general conflict policy, as against specific
conflict intervention, was embedded in other, mainly development
assistance, policies. He found it difficult to identify generic
approaches to conflict prevention, although all countries examined used
similar language in their descriptions of conflict and its causes, even
if there was only vague consensus on what those causes are.

The Council of [the **[E]{.mark}**uropean
**[U]{.mark}**nion]{.underline}, at its June 2001 meeting in
Gothenburg,14 [endorsed]{.underline} a programme of [conflict
[prevention]{.mark}]{.underline},15 stating this [would "improve the
Union's capacity to undertake coherent early warning, analysis and
action \[to prevent conflict\]" and]{.underline} that "\[c\] onflict
prevention [[is one of the **main objectives**]{.mark} of the Union's
external relations]{.underline} and should be integrated in all its
relevant aspects." [This]{.underline} document and the European Security
Strategy16 [provided the foundation for]{.underline} the [elaboration of
a whole series of policies, including]{.underline} the promotion of
**[mediation]{.underline}** in conflict prevention and resolution. It
was followed in 2009 by the "Concept on Strengthening EU Mediation and
Dialogue Capacities,"17 which uses the term mediation to encompass
improved communication, negotiation, dialogue and facilitation through
the offices of a third party, namely the EU. In this document mediation
can be directive and coercive. [[It]{.mark} also [notes]{.mark} the
[EU's]{.mark} **financial [power]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **moral
[authority]{.mark}** [as **positive factors** in]{.mark} a
**[mediation]{.mark}** process]{.underline}.

[**(No) Future** Europe in the world]{.underline}

[[In 2030, the]{.underline}]{.mark} European Union
([[EU]{.underline}]{.mark}) [has [become
**irrelevant**]{.mark}]{.underline} in international relations. [Its
ambition to act as a normative and values-based power lies in
**tatters**. The]{.underline} Common Foreign and Security Policy/Common
[[Security and Defence]{.mark} Policy]{.underline}
([CFSP/CSDP]{.underline}) [is anything but common]{.underline} --
rather, [**it [is fragmented]{.mark}**. The dream of [speaking with one
voice remains]{.mark}]{.underline} an
**[[unattainable]{.underline}]{.mark}** ideal. In practice, [**[the EU
has little agency]{.mark}**. Most decisions on foreign, security and
defence issues are taken **unilaterally** or]{.underline} in **[ad
hoc]{.underline}** coalitions -- and do not always align with the EU's
aim to promote peace, security and progress in Europe and in the world
(Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union: Preamble). [[The]{.mark} CFSP/[CSDP resembles]{.mark} an
**uncoordinated [patchwork]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} small state [responses
to]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}transnational security challenges, such
as **[[climate change]{.mark}, digitalization, nuclear
[prolif]{.mark}eration or migration [and]{.mark} regional
[crises]{.mark}]{.underline}** and conflicts. [[This makes it]{.mark}
**virtually [impossible]{.mark}** [to establish a]{.mark} Union that is
a **[credible actor]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the international scene.

[In]{.underline} times of complexly intertwined global competition, and
**[growing illiberalism]{.underline}**, the EU seems like a relic of
bygone times. As [Europe cannot act **united in CFSP/CSDP matters**,
[questions arise as to]{.mark} what purpose [the **EU**]{.mark}
**institutions**]{.underline} and agencies **[serve]{.underline}**. In
2030, most [member states allocate little]{.underline} funding and
expertise [to EU efforts]{.underline} on CFSP/CSDP, [including
humanitarian aid, operations and missions]{.underline}. Many
high-ranking officials in Brussels, for example, in the European
External Action Service and the European Defence Agency, are relocated
to national capitals. Many member states withdraw from the Permanent
Structured Cooperation (PESCO), the European Defence Fund (EDF) and the
Coordinated Annual Review of Defence (CARD), as these initiatives did
not produce the output that participating states initially hoped to
achieve.

In 2030, [it becomes an inescapable reality that the EU's CFSP/CSDP is a
**nonstarter**. The most capable European nation-states explore other
options to act on the international scene]{.underline}. Especially, the
United Kingdom and France are increasingly disappointed by their
European allies. The UK's exit from the EU created a multilayered system
of half-hearted security arrangements without access to relevant
CFSP/CSDP decision-making bodies; and [the French claims of]{.underline}
strategic sovereignty for Europe and [a]{.underline} 'true [European
army']{.underline} (BBC, 2018) [fell on deaf ears]{.underline}. In
**[2030]{.underline}**, it **[is too late]{.underline}** for
soul-searching. Outside of the EU framework, [the United Kingdom and
France each pursue national 'Sonderwege'.]{.underline} The United
Kingdom launches fora to strengthen its 'hard security' ties with
Commonwealth countries. France has established a formal strategic
dialogue with the Russian Federation to pursue shared interests, that
is, related to stability in the Middle East. Caveats expressed by their
European partners, especially Germany and Central Eastern European (CEE)
states, are ignored, further dividing the continent. Germany, as the
main advocate of an inclusive, rules-based and value-centred approach to
European integration, cannot keep the EU together. [Spain and Italy are
particularly unwilling to accept German leadership]{.underline} and
instead pursue their national interests, which do not always complement
each other. **[The EU's fragmentation]{.underline}** also **[limits
Germany's]{.underline}** own **[ability to act]{.underline}**. After
decades of (rhetorically) promoting an emancipation from the United
States, liberal-minded political [elites and the majority of the German
public]{.underline} have [pinned all their hopes on the **EU** as a
means to influence international affairs]{.underline}. Yet
**[this]{.underline}** channel of exercising **[power seems
lost]{.underline}**.

The EU's diminishing role in the future is not confined to the CFSP/CSDP
-- rather, [the EU's [failure]{.mark} in this policy]{.underline} area
[[has]{.mark} major negative **[spillover
effects]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The EU's [powerlessness results in a
state of **uncertainty on the continent**. The power vacuum is filled
by]{.underline} state actors with global ambitions, notably [China and
Russia]{.underline}, who are intensely involved in European affairs.
[Asymmetric [interdependencies]{.mark} between global
players]{.underline}, which make massive investments abroad, and
European states [[are **weaponized**]{.underline}]{.mark} (cf. Farrell
and Newman, 2019). [This]{.underline} especially [concerns high-tech
industries, network technologies, transport logistics and
infrastructure. The EU's economic performance is]{.underline}
increasingly **[dependent]{.underline}** on foreign investments and
technology transfer. The involvement of [external actors]{.underline}
makes permanent channels of communication a necessity -- and, in doing
so, it [normalize]{.underline}s a policy of [detente vis-à-vis
competitors]{.underline}. It becomes evident that
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} entanglement [[compromises the **EU's
ability** ]{.mark}**to act [in international affairs]{.mark}** as
conflicts and crises in the EU's neighbourhood draw closer]{.underline}.

Russia continues to project power in the South Caucasus, the Western
Balkans and Ukraine while hiding 'behind a fog of deniability'
(Secrieru, 2019: 2). [Hostile actions]{.underline} also
[reach]{.underline} the [Europe]{.underline}an continent: low-level
[foreign interference]{.underline}, such as disinformation campaigns,
cyberattacks, unauthorized border crossings, intensifies across Europe,
especially in the non-NATO members Sweden and Finland, and this is not
countered with credible deterrence and defence. Even though the EU's
solidarity clause (Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union:
Article 222) is triggered after intrusions into Swedish IT systems, the
Swedes receive little support in practice. Parallel [blackouts hit most
European capitals, instability and insecurity spreads, and vital
services cannot be maintained. Cross-border turmoil ensues]{.underline}.
Paramilitary, predominantly [foreign-financed forces gain
influence]{.underline}. As **[[the EU fails]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
provide joined-up action to protect its citizens, it risks losing its
raison d'être. [NATO]{.underline}, with its drastically reduced US
presence, also [proves **ill-suited** to providing security]{.underline}
on the European continent. [European security is now 'managed'
by]{.underline} a multitude of stakeholders in the public, private and
third sector (e.g. criminal **[gangs]{.underline}**,
**[militia]{.underline}**, individual activists, private security
companies, NGOs, energy, industry [and]{.underline} IT businesses --
possibly used as **[proxy actors]{.underline}**). Institutional,
[strategic]{.underline} and [capability]{.underline}-related
[insufficiencies make the EU a **bystander**]{.underline} to its own
decline. [The EU's [failures in]{.mark} the realm of regional
[security]{.mark} are indicative of larger cracks in the surface, which
[become **irreversible in 2030**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [Europe]{.underline}an idea of being 'united in diversity' is not
primarily undermined by external pressure; rather, it [is hollowed
out]{.underline} by internal problems. In 2030, Europe, and especially
[the EU, is made aware of its **[inability to provide
security]{.mark}**. It [cannot diffuse
**democratic**]{.mark}]{.underline} values and [**[norms]{.mark}** in
the world]{.underline} due to internal crises. [The EU]{.underline} has
not learnt to use 'the language of power' (Borrell, 2019) vis-à-vis
adversaries; it also **[missed the opportunity]{.underline}** to
self-critically address the increasingly important internal--external
nexus. [In 2030, the EU is]{.underline} a pawn in the hands of the
powerful, and [unable to make a difference in international
affairs]{.underline}.

**[[How did we get there]{.mark}?]{.underline}**

We argue that [the [lack of]{.mark} an effective]{.underline}, coherent
and progressive [grand strategy for the EU's engagement]{.underline}
with and in the world -- closely related to the EU's failure to deliver
results at home and abroad -- led to the disastrous situation described
above. First, the EU's performance until 2030 shows little consensus on
the ends, ways and means of European integration. Second, as a corollary
of this, [the EU neither acquired relevant CFSP/[CSDP
capabilities]{.mark} nor implemented necessary reforms]{.underline} to
pursue common objectives in this area (where they existed). This
resulted in partial withdrawal and ebbing support of the member states
as well as of important strategic allies such as the US and NATO. Third,
[the CFSP/CSDP failure]{.underline} to meet member states expectations
and deliver tangible results [affected the **EU's reputation** in the
world]{.underline}. While, as per the EU Global Strategy of 2019, the
ambition was to deliver peace and security in Europe and the world,
divergence in member states interests and insufficiently coherent
capability planning impeded its achievement of this objective.

Lack of European-wide strategic thinking

Until 2030, the EU continued to rhetorically adhere to the idea of being
a 'force for good' in the world. In practice, however, national
interests undermined common efforts. Most importantly, [the EU failed to
establish a common policy]{.underline} towards the United States, China
and Russia, as well as towards the United Kingdom and smaller states.
[The lack of an impactful EU strategy in global affairs is inextricably
linked to challenges of collective action and intra-European
problems]{.underline}. Although France and Germany together with the new
'geopolitical Commission' under Ursula von der Leyen pushed hard for a
common policy, the approach was flawed: it did not sufficiently
integrate the CEE countries, failed to tackle social inequalities and
could not effectively bridge the demand of liberal markets with national
autonomy (cf. Snyder, 2019; Colgan and Keohane, 2017). [During the
2020s, the [Europe]{.mark}an continent **[drifted apart]{.mark}
politically**. Nationalists and]{.underline} (right-wing/left-wing)
[populists came into power]{.underline} in many EU states. European
citizens felt unrepresented at EU level and the [EU [institutions
were]{.mark}]{.underline} increasingly [[perceived as
**illegitimate**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Irritations on the ground as well
as [institutional]{.underline} democratic **[deficits]{.underline}** at
EU level were allowed to [turn into]{.underline} a profound
**[disconnection]{.underline}**.

In the 2020s, the EU faced disillusioned, and in the majority
nationalist and illiberal, citizens. [[The]{.mark} EU's very
**existence** was called into question and **CFSP/[CSDP]{.mark}** [was
perceived as **irrelevant**]{.mark}. As the EU seemed increasingly
incapable of managing European affairs]{.underline}, the transatlantic
relationship came to the fore: [[was]{.mark} the United States,
especially [NATO, capable]{.mark} of defending]{.underline} European
ideals and [the international rules-based order? [In
2030]{.mark}]{.underline}, the answer is **[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
While an [emancipation from the United States was pursued]{.underline}
at EU level, especially after a further illiberal turn in US politics in
the mid-2020s, most CEE states were reluctant to disengage from their
most capable security provider (e.g. in terms of arms procurement). This
[transatlantic ambivalence resulted in less
interoperability]{.underline}, military mobility and information
exchange on the European continent.

### EU Impacts\-\--2NC

#### Africa instability escalates

Walter **Mead** **13**. James Clarke Chace Professor of Foreign Affairs
and Humanities, Bard College. "Peace in The Congo? Why the World Should
Care." The American Interest. 12-15-2013.
<https://www.the-american-interest.com/2013/12/15/peace-in-the-congo-why-the-world-should-care/>

[One of the **biggest questions of the 21st century** is whether [this
**destructive dynamic**]{.mark} can be contained, or whether the demand
for ethnic, cultural and/or religious homogeneity [will]{.mark} continue
to **[convulse world politics]{.mark}**, **drive new generations of
conflict**, and **create millions more victims**]{.underline}. [The
**Congo conflict**]{.underline} is a disturbing piece of evidence
**[suggest]{.underline}**ing that, in Africa at least, [[there is
potential for]{.mark} this kind of conflict]{.underline}. The Congo war
(and the long Hutu-Tutsi conflict in neighboring countries) is not,
unfortunately alone. The secession of South Sudan from Sudan proper, the
wars in what remains of that unhappy country, the secession of Eritrea
from Ethiopia and the rise of Christian-Muslim tension right across
Africa (where religious conflict often is fed by and intensifies
"tribal"---in Europe we would say "ethnic" or "national"---conflicts)
are strong indications that the potential for [**[huge]{.mark} and
[destructive conflict]{.mark}** [across Africa]{.mark}]{.underline} is
very real.

But one must look beyond Africa. The Middle East of course is aflame in
religious and ethnic conflict. The old British Raj including India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma and Sri Lanka offers countless examples of
ethnic and religious conflict that sometimes is contained, and sometimes
boils to the surface in horrendous acts of violence.

Beyond that, rival nationalisms in East and Southeast Asia are keeping
the world awake at night.

[The Congo war should be a reminder to us all that the **[foundations of
our world are dynamite]{.mark}**, and that the [potential for]{.mark}
new [conflicts on the **scale of**]{.mark} **the horrific wars of [the
20th century]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} very much [with us]{.mark}
today]{.underline}.

The second lesson from this conflict stems from the realization of how
much patience and commitment from the international community (which in
this case included the Atlantic democracies and a coalition of African
states working as individual countries and through various international
institutions) it has taken to get this far towards peace. Particularly
at a time when many Americans want the US to turn inwards, there are
people who make the argument that it is really none of America's
business to invest time and energy in the often thankless task of
solving these conflicts.

That might be an ugly but defensible position if we didn't live in such
a tinderbox world. Someone could rationally say, yes, it's terrible that
a million plus people are being killed overseas in a horrific conflict,
but the war is really very far away and America has urgent needs at home
and we should husband the resources we have available for foreign policy
on things that have more power to affect us directly.

[The problem is that these [wars **spread**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They
may start in places that we don't care much about]{.underline} (most
Americans didn't give a rat's patootie about whether Germany controlled
the Sudetenland in 1938 or Danzig in 1939) [but they tend to spread to
places that we do care very much about]{.underline}. This can be because
a revisionist great power like Germany in 1938-39 needs to overturn the
balance of power in Europe to achieve its goals, or it can be because
[instability in a very remote place triggers problems in places that we
care about very much]{.underline}. Out of Afghanistan in 2001 came both
9/11 and the [waves of insurgency and [instability]{.mark} that threaten
to **rip nuclear-armed Pakistan apart** or **with [trigger]{.mark} wider
[conflict India]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Out of the mess in Syria a
witches' brew of terrorism and religious conflict looks set to
complicate the security of our allies in Europe and the Middle East and
even the security of the oil supply on which the world economy so
profoundly depends]{.underline}.

[**[Africa]{.mark}**, and the potential for upheaval there, [is
of]{.mark} **more [importance to American security]{.mark}** than many
people may understand]{.underline}. [The line **between Africa and the
Middle East** is a soft one]{.underline}. The **[weak
states]{.underline}** that straddle the southern approaches of the
Sahara [are **ideal petri dishes** for **Al Qaeda type
groups**]{.underline} [to form and attract local support]{.underline}.
[There are **networks** of funding and religious contact that give
groups in these countries potential access to **funds**, **fighters**,
**training** and **weapons** from the Middle East]{.underline}. [A
**[war in the]{.mark} eastern [Congo]{.mark}**]{.underline} might not
directly trigger these other conflicts, but it [helps to [create]{.mark}
the [**swirling underworld** of arms trading]{.mark}, money transfers,
[illegal commerce]{.mark} and the rise of a generation of young men who
become **[experienced fighters]{.mark}**---and know no other way to make
a living]{.underline}. [It **[destabilizes]{.mark}** the environment for
[neighboring states]{.mark} (like Uganda and Kenya) that play much more
direct role in potential crises of greater concern to us]{.underline}.

#### Latin American conflict goes nuclear\-\--draws in Russia and China

Dr. R. Evan **Ellis 16**. Research professor of Latin American Studies

As noted previously, **[[there is]{.underline}]{.mark}** arguably **[[no
region]{.underline}]{.mark}** (including Asia) upon [**[which the
U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates **[is more dependent for]{.mark}
its**]{.underline} prosperity and **[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
and with which it is more closely tied through bonds of family, than
Latin America and the Caribbean. In terms of trade and investment, from
manufacturers to the food Americans put on the table, there is no region
for which disruption of commerce with the United States could do more
damage to our economy and the everyday lives of Americans. Reciprocally,
the region's proximity to the United States makes it a logical and
attractive business partner; there is not another region of the world
for which prosperity, healthy infrastructure, and institutions could
contribute more to a win-win commercial relationship with the United
States. With respect to security, [the United States is blessed by the
absence of neighbors that pose a direct military threat to the nation,
are experiencing conditions of chaos, or permit U.S. adversaries to
operate from their territory. Yet, **[if]{.mark} these** fortunate
**[conditions were to change, the]{.mark}** resulting
**[threat]{.mark}** to U.S. national security [**could**]{.mark} force a
significant **[reorient]{.mark}**ation of U.S. **[security initiatives
away from]{.mark}** its **[foreign engagements]{.mark}** to address the
emergent threat closer to home.]{.underline} To use a military analogy,
[Latin America and the Caribbean is, for the United States, an
"unoccupied high ground."]{.underline} The fact that the United States
does not fully leverage the opportunities offered by Latin America, nor
suffers a significant immediate security threat from the region, does
not make it any less strategic. [The Challenge of Transnational
Organized Crime in the Region. The activities of transnational organized
crime in Latin America and the Caribbean, often characterized as the
principle security issue in the region, is more of a strategic challenge
to the United States than is commonly understood.]{.underline} On the
one hand, the [activities of groups]{.underline} such as the Maras [in
the **Northern Triangle** and warring [**cartels in Mexico** generate
violence]{.mark} and destroy economic opportunity in ways that generate
refugee flows toward the United States.]{.underline} Indeed, the 2014
crisis of child migrants from Central America obliged the Obama
administration to request an additional \$3.7 billion to respond to the
situation, eclipsing the \$979 million previously spent on the region
under the Central America Regional Security Initiative since 2008.2 In
addition, [the money used to enable transnational criminal activities
**[corrupts institutions]{.mark}**, **[undermining governance]{.mark}**,
and [**expanding criminal networks**]{.mark} that can be used by
**terrorist organizations** to raise and launder money, **smuggle**
persons and **materiel** through the region, as well as creating spaces
in which they can **hide, train, plan** operations, **and recruit**
fighters for their global activities.]{.underline} Such threats are
magnified further where anti-U.S. governments, such as the "Bolivarian
Socialist" government of Venezuela, tolerate and possibly even
facilitate the activities of such groups, permitting, [for example, the
entry of Iranian paramilitary Qods forces into the region]{.underline}

Potential Use of the Region by U.S. Adversaries to Conduct Actions
Against the United States. Military professionals in the United States
have the responsibility for planning how to fight the nation's wars if
called upon to do so by their elected leaders. In today's globally
interconnected world, [it is highly unlikely that a U.S. "near-peer
competitor," such as **[China or Russia]{.mark}**, would allow the
United States to engage with them in such a conflict]{.underline}
(however undesirable) [entirely as an "away game."]{.underline} U.S.
defense planners must expect that [[in]{.mark} such [a conflict]{.mark},
the adversary [would employ]{.mark} its full global range of assets,
capabilities, and options, including: relationships and access
agreements with foreign [militaries]{.mark}]{.underline} (however
benign) [in all parts of the world]{.underline}, knowledge of, and the
potential for, staging activities leveraging their commercial operations
near the United States, as well as information technology infrastructure
built by the adversary's companies there. [Potential U.S. adversaries
such as Russia and China may be expected to leverage such assets and
relationships [in Latin America]{.mark} and the Caribbean]{.underline},
in addition to other regions, [in order to undermine U.S. coalition
formation in the run-up to a conflict]{.underline}, to conduct
operations in the region during the conflict to disrupt the U.S. economy
and financial system, and potentially [[to **conduct military
operations**]{.mark} from Latin America and the Caribbean to attack U.S.

While [Russia and China]{.underline} have not currently established
formal military bases in the region that could be used against the
United States, their familiarity with Latin American armed forces
through regular military-to-military engagement, their knowledge of
regional infrastructure such as ports, airports, and commercial
logistics systems, means that they [could achieve a functional military
capability in the region rapidly [in]{.mark} the **[months]{.mark}**
leading up to the conflict,]{.underline} if U.S. adversaries in Latin

#### EU credibility prevents North Korean arms racing\-\--goes nuclear

Boris **Toucas 17**, Visiting Fellow with the Europe Program at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, "North Korea: The
European Union Could Help Break the Diplomatic Stalemate", Beyond
Parallel -- CSIS Blog, 1/5/2017,
https://beyondparallel.csis.org/north-korea-the-european-union-could-help-break-the-diplomatic-stalemate/

[North [Korea]{.mark}'s continued progress on its nuclear and missile
programs remains one of the most significant challenges to the
international community]{.underline}. This is why the adoption of a new
UN Security Council resolution that closes an important sanctions
loophole and imposes closer scrutiny of North Korea's diplomatic
activities sends a strong, if late, message of unity and international
resolve. [But what comes next?]{.underline} There are a variety of
options: [Diplomatic normalization]{.underline}? [This [could trigger
a]{.mark} **regional [arms race]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Military
intervention? [[This]{.mark} could **[plunge]{.mark}** Northeast [Asia
into **chaos**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unfortunately, prospects for
negotiations are bleak, and unofficial discussions between North Korea
and the United States are unlikely to succeed as in previous rounds.

World peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts
proportionate to the dangers which threaten it. ---Schuman Declaration,
May 9, 1950

I recently argued that North Korea isn't the only actor responsible for
the international community's fatigue in addressing a dangerous security
dilemma. In fact, [the [Six-Party]{.mark} Talks--[only]{.mark} framework
may have [undermined]{.mark} prospects for exploring [other]{.mark}
types of [negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline} when these talks failed.
[Such a situation is counterproductive as [it **convinces**]{.mark}
North [Korea to **continue**]{.mark} **its [destructive
behavior]{.mark}** to achieve a new outcome. By contrast, [introducing
**more actors**]{.mark}]{.underline} into the talks
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [[reduce
tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} between the main parties
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} could [help]{.underline} Washington, Seoul,
and Tokyo [[reframe]{.mark} the [discussion]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Mongolia, Singapore, Malaysia or the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) could be potential participants, but what about the
European Union and its member states? While the European Union will
never be the main actor in resolving the North Korean crisis, there is
an argument for Europe's increased participation in the debate.

The European Union's Potential Added-value on North Korea

[The **[E]{.mark}**]{.underline}uropean
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion's [[multiple-layered]{.mark} diplomatic
[approach represents a **unique tool** for]{.mark} placing
[pressure]{.mark} on troublesome countries: besides members states'
bilateral channels, the **E**]{.underline}uropean
**[U]{.underline}**nion [[is]{.mark} also [a vehicle]{.mark} aimed at
[undertaking]{.mark} coordinated [action once]{.mark} political
[consensus]{.mark} has [emerged]{.mark}. Twenty-six]{.underline} out of
twenty-eight EU [members maintain diplomatic relations with
the]{.underline} Democratic People's Republic of Korea
[(DPRK)]{.underline}, six of which have diplomatic offices in Pyongyang
(France only has a humanitarian and cultural office). [These [bilateral
ties]{.mark} are diverse]{.underline}, with some dating back to the Cold
War. [They [are]{.mark} of **[crucial]{.mark} importance** [to]{.mark}
the North [Korea]{.mark}n regime]{.underline}, as part of its narrative
on legitimacy and its appetite for international recognition, which may
be attractive to them. [Washington would certainly benefit from having
the **E**]{.underline}uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion and its members
[more proactively using their own diplomatic influence on the regime and
its clients]{.underline}.

Furthermore, [[EU **expertise**]{.mark} in proliferation crises
[is]{.mark} often [underrated]{.mark}]{.underline}. The European Union
was a party to the negotiations with Iran, as was France, the United
Kingdom, and Germany. Most member states actively take part in the
Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), intercepting illicit trade
flows across the Mediterranean. Moreover, the European Union has
implemented one of the most comprehensive restrictive measures regimes
against North Korea, which has evolved into a comprehensive strategy
directly targeting the civil and military proliferation chain, as well
as strategic economic sectors. Finally, the 2016 decision to put an end
to hosting the DPRK's overseas workers also represents a laudable
attempt to tackle financial flows that indirectly support proliferation
activities, which sets a precedent for the activities of Russia, China,
and several of North Korea's clients in Africa and the Middle East.
However, outreach among the United States, South Korea, Japan, and the
European Union on these practices has been limited so far, preventing
full harmonization of national policies among the like-minded.

[[As an **external actor**]{.mark} to the region, the
**[E]{.mark}**]{.underline}uropean **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion
[[could]{.mark} play a particular role in [unlock]{.mark}ing
[negotiations]{.mark}. First, it has a better record on implementing
restrictive measures than]{.underline}, for example, some potential [new
Asian players]{.underline}, whose stance is more ambiguous. [Second,
[it]{.mark} is a bureaucratic machine that [has]{.mark} the [**unique
capacity** to **build consensus**]{.mark} among partners **[even
when]{.mark}** their [interests are at odds]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Paradoxically, [the ability to observe]{.underline} North Korea [from
afar might give the **E**]{.underline}uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion
[an advantage]{.underline} over the participants of the Six-Party Talks
where the six countries have different vital interests at stake. In this
regard, the European Union is detached just enough to dare to make
innovative proposals.

After Us, the Floods

Last year's [**apocalyptic** wildfires in **Australia** and]{.underline}
this January's devastating [floods in **Jakarta**]{.underline} gave us a
glimpse of [what is to come if we don't **act now**]{.underline}. In
fact, for many, [the changing [climate]{.mark} already [poses a massive
**security threat**]{.mark}. In 2019, [24.9 million people]{.mark} were
internally **[displaced]{.mark}** as a result of]{.underline}
weather-related [disasters]{.underline}. Absent drastic measures, [such
events will become even more **frequent and destructive**]{.underline}
in the future. The World Bank estimates that [by 2050, as a result of
**climate change**, more than 140 million people could become
**internally displaced** in Sub-Saharan **Africa**, South **Asia**, and
**Latin America** alone.]{.underline}

These **[[climate impacts]{.underline}]{.mark}** can also [[undermine
**peace**]{.mark}, particularly in **fragile states**]{.underline}.
While the effect of climate change on armed [**[conflict]{.mark}**
with[in states]{.mark}]{.underline} has only been modest so far, it [is
expected to [rise]{.mark} with **global temperatures**. The same holds
true for **interstate conflicts**]{.underline}, as [climate change may
[exacerbate **resource scarcity**]{.mark}]{.underline} or create new
[[and **contested**]{.mark} abundance, like in the
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. If we continue on the current path,
[[climate change will become]{.underline}]{.mark} one of **[[the
most]{.mark} serious]{.underline}**---if not the **[[dominant
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[to]{.underline} individual and
**[global security]{.underline}**.

The COVID-19 crisis underscores that [a 21st century understanding of
security needs to include **non-traditional threats like climate
change**]{.underline} and points to the importance of reflecting and
integrating this broader concept of security in our domestic and foreign
policies. [Adapting]{.underline} our definition of national and
international security [is]{.underline} so [important]{.underline}
because [it decisively influences the way we allocate our
resources]{.underline}. Our collective lack of pandemic
preparedness---despite ample warnings---has highlighted this fact in the
most painful manner.

It is good that [the strategic community increasingly embraces the link
between security and climate change]{.underline}. Eight years ago, when
we started to debate the issue in Munich on a regular basis, many were
skeptical as to whether climate change was a relevant agenda item for a
conference on security. That is certainly no longer the case, but
political action has failed to match the rhetoric. This is particularly
evident with regard to the weak implementation of the agreements reached
at the UN Climate Change Conferences: rather than limiting global
warming to 1.5°C, as governments agreed to in Paris in 2015, the world
is currently heading for 3.2°C global warming by 2100. [**[Reducing
g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}a[s]{.mark} emissions** [is
the]{.mark} single [most **effective action**]{.mark} we can take to
limit climate-related security risks]{.underline}. Yet it is only due to
the massive economic shock of a pandemic that 2020 may be the first year
in which annual global emissions actually fall by the amount necessary
to meet the Paris objectives.

Today, most people understand that no state can address global
challenges like pandemics or climate change on its own. [However,
[international efforts are being **undermined**]{.mark}]{.underline} as
multilateral fora and instruments lose support and nationalism gains
ground. The United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement---and now
possibly the World Health Organization---is a stark illustration of this
trend. With governments understandably focused on addressing the public
health emergency and economic downturn, the COVID-19 crisis has further
contributed to the inward turn of many countries and diverted attention
from more long-term policy objectives.

In order to offset these developments it is paramount to both strengthen
the capacities of international and regional organizations and
[[establish coalitions-of-the-willing that are able and willing to lead
the way through the multilateral deadlock.]{.mark}
[Given]{.mark}]{.underline} their economic and **[political
[weight]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the world, **[it is the]{.underline}**
European Union (**[[EU]{.underline}]{.mark}**) and its member [[states
that have a particularly **important role** to play]{.mark} in this
regard.]{.underline}

In the three preceding scenarios, the USA has sustained its presence in
Europe and support for NATO's article 5 based on its self-interest that
Europe should be whole, free and at peace, as well as in avoiding the
reputational damage to other relations that a full US withdrawal from
Europe would entail. [In this]{.underline} final [scenario, the USA
neither perceives Russia as a threat nor has any interest in upholding
its previous standing in world affairs.]{.underline} The USA thus sees
only diminishing returns from its European engagement. Partly [**[as a
result of]{.mark} this [US-initiated post- Atlanticism]{.mark}**[, the
German-French engine **receives a vital fuel injection**]{.mark}, which
subsequently [leads to **considerable integration in**]{.mark} **the
[defence]{.mark} realm**. [As the US]{.mark}A [backs away from Europe,
**the EU is** ]{.mark}**independently [able to fill]{.mark} the [ensuing
security vacuum ahead]{.mark} of Russia and/or China.** While not all EU
member states perceive further European integration as the best
response]{.underline} to managing a fragmented world order,
[**[most]{.mark} of the [members]{.mark} of the eurozone [decide to
further integrate their military forces]{.mark}**, with the '[inner
six']{.mark} founding members of the EU at the forefront of [an **'ever
closer union'**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} This deepened integration is
mainly driven by a renewed French-German axis. While France agrees to
support the German vision on eurozone reform (less centralization and
greater national fiscal responsibility), in return Germany supports the
French vision on a shared defence budget and the creation of an
autonomous European defence technological and industrial base (EDTIB).
[At the bilateral level, Germany decides to fund the stationing of
French nuclear weapons in Germany as a way to balance out wavering US
security guarantees. For France, this further demonstrates its role as
the principal de facto leader of European defence.]{.underline} While
the previous scenario allowed for considerable levels of differentiation
and flexibility, this scenario offers a more fundamental choice of
staying on the Franco-German train or getting off. This integration by
directorate forces other member states to either leave the EU or
integrate to a greater extent than they might prefer. As the EU
increases its legal pressure on Hungary and Poland, Hungary eventually
chooses to follow in the footsteps of the UK and leave the EU. [The
other members of the eurozone, however, feel the need to join the
enhanced cooperation for the same reasons as joining PESCO -- it is
simply too costly not to]{.underline}. States outside of this
accentuated 'core Europe' find themselves with considerably less
political weight than before, which pushes some of the 'semi-periphery'
member states to further deepen political integration with the EU
against their will, while others contemplate following Hungary out of
the EU. [In terms of cohesion, big [differences in]{.mark} member
[states' strategic cultures remain, but **gradually converge as a result
of increased cooperation on military operations**]{.mark} in the
southern neighbourhood.]{.underline} The dominance of the French-German
axis leads to CSDP missions mainly being focused on former French
colonies in North Africa and the Sahel. This tendency worries member
states that would have liked to see more EU security efforts in the
eastern neighbourhood. In addition, [the creation of an autonomous EDTIB
further strengthens EU military capabilities.]{.underline} [[High-end
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} that are difficult to develop and
procure at the national level -- such as drones, air-to-air refuelling,
strategic bombers and submarines -- [[are developed]{.mark} and fully
financed by a coordinated defence planning mechanism between the core
Europe member states.]{.underline} In sum, [a [dramatic **reduction in
US engagement in**]{.mark} **and with [Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline},
coupled with a reinvigorated German-French relationship, [**[unleashes a
process]{.mark}** that leads to a semi- federalized defence union among
a core membership.]{.underline} Not all the member states or their
populations are comfortable with this development. Some voice their
concerns, others remain at the periphery and some even choose to leave
the EU altogether. However, the increased military capabilities, and a
strong political will to use them, lead to a significant increase in the
EU's security actorness. In other words, [**both the [ambition
and]{.mark} the [political unity]{.mark} within the CSDP [is
high]{.mark}.** By increasing its military capabilities and]{.underline}
gradually [ending its dependence on the USA, the [EU becomes a
**politically and strategically autonomous actor capable of**]{.mark}
**managing** a limited form of territorial defence and [high-end peace
enforcement operations]{.mark}.]{.underline} The increase in capability,
however, is [[mostly directed towards]{.mark} the interests of the [core
group -- and its Franco-German leadership]{.mark} in particular. EU
member states that abstain from this enhanced cooperation find
themselves lacking in both transatlantic guarantees and the benefits of
a strengthened EU defence cooperation.]{.underline}

#### New initiatives smooth the transition

Interoperability Centre, 6-3-**20**, "Europe's road to strategic
autonomy: Summarising the concrete steps taken,"
https://finabel.org/europes-road-to-strategic-autonomy-summarising-the-concrete-steps-taken/

[[The E]{.underline}]{.mark}uropean [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nion
[[has]{.mark} **already under[taken]{.mark}**]{.underline} various
**[[concrete steps]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[towards]{.mark} strategic
[autonomy]{.mark} by creating entities]{.underline} that will work
toward achieving this objective.

First, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} Capability Development Plan
([[CDP]{.underline}]{.mark}), where Member States [identify priorities
in their national defence planning]{.underline} and streamline the
objectives into a set that all can agree on while maintaining
consistency with NATO's objectives (EEAS, 2020). [The overall aim of the
CDP is to enhance **cooperation and coherence** in Member States' plans
and to define common European priorities in capability
development]{.underline} (European Defence Agency, 2020a). To
[[streamline]{.mark} European countries'
[objectives]{.mark}]{.underline} in this field, [the CDP informs the
other instruments]{.underline} described below: the Coordinated Annual
Review on Defence (**[[CARD]{.underline}]{.mark}**), the Permanent
Structured Cooperation (**[[PESCO]{.underline}]{.mark}**) and the
European Defence Fund (**[[EDF]{.underline}]{.mark}**) (EEAS, 2020). As
presented above, [[develop]{.mark}ing common objectives
enhances]{.underline} the Member States' [[capacity to **act
autonomously**]{.mark} **and as one entity**]{.underline}.

[[CARD]{.underline}]{.mark} is another of the EU's major defence
achievements. This mechanism was created to
**[[centralise]{.underline}]{.mark}** analysis on [the **[implementation
of defence plans]{.mark}** at the national level]{.underline}. [The
European Defence Agency]{.underline} (EDA) [gathers all the latest and
the most detailed information Member States can provide]{.underline} on
the results of their implementation of the CDP to launch the CARD
process, which is composed of four steps. First, the EDA analyses all
relevant data it has gathered [and]{.underline} all material provided --
voluntarily -- by the Member States. Second, the EDA engages in a
bilateral dialogue with each individual participating Member State to
validate and potentially consolidate the information. Third, the EDA
produces a "CARD Analysis" which "presents aggregate data and
\[identifies\] trends regarding defence spending plans, implementation
of priorities", and cooperation opportunities. Finally, a definitive
[CARD]{.underline} report drafted by the EDA presents the main findings
and recommendations (EDA, 2020b). Such a document will [allow Member
States to **streamline their objectives** to **identify cooperation
opportunities** in capability development.]{.underline}

[[PESCO is]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[legally
binding]{.underline}]{.mark}** framework based on Article 46 of the
Lisbon Treaty. In Biscop's (2017) words, [it "formulate\[s\] the level
of ambition for the strategic autonomy of a group of European States"
who are "capable and willing to do so"]{.underline} (EEAS, 2019a). The
PESCO framework now consists of a list of 47 projects to which **[25
European states participate]{.underline}**; out of EU Member States,
[[only Denmark and Malta do not participate]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
aim is [to "jointly develop defence capabilities]{.underline} and
increase their readiness and availability for EU military missions and
operations" (EEAS, 2020). [PESCO is designed to be led by a core group
of states]{.underline} -- in which [France and Germany particularly need
to have a prominent role]{.underline} -- who will take bold and concrete
steps to move European defence forward, working in a "he who loves me
follows me" way. The aim is for the core groups to lead others into
harmonising their capability development plans and to eventually reach a
point where all European states act in the same direction.

Finally, the EDF will foster innovation and competitiveness in the
European defence market by providing the necessary funding for Research
& Development (R&D) and by co-financing approved development projects
with a contribution of up to 20% (EC, 2019 & EEAS, 2019b). For research,
the level of EDF funding can be up to 100% (EC, 2019). The collaborative
aspect of the R&D strand of the EDF combined with the co-financing
offered by the capability strand lessens the financial burden that
defence and capability development bears on European countries[. [By
alleviating]{.mark} some [unnecessary]{.mark} and duplicated
[costs]{.mark} across the European continent, [the EDF initiative
**contributes significantly**]{.mark} to the European journey to
strategic autonomy]{.underline}. Through the initiative[, the EU will
eventually be able to build an autonomous and self-sufficient defence
market by developing its capabilities while supporting European
industri]{.underline}es. Thanks to the savings made through pooling and
sharing capacities, European actors can also better afford critical
technology for which they still rely on increasingly isolationist
non-European powers. By developing its autonomous defence market, [the
EU therefore significantly expands its ability to "act alone when
necessary"]{.underline}, in the spirit of strategic autonomy.

**[SHARED IDENTITY, VALUES, AND INTERESTS]{.underline}**

It becomes evident that [the [notion]{.mark} of a [NATO based on shared
identity]{.mark} and values has been an **[illusion]{.mark}** for some
time.]{.underline} Populist and nationalist tendencies that were present
when the economy was good accelerate with the economic downturn. [Within
NATO and the European Union, [democratic backsliding]{.mark} goes
[unchecked]{.mark} and [creates societal vulnerabilities]{.mark}, such
as **[corruption]{.mark}**, that adversaries exploit]{.underline}.
[[NATO's attractiveness]{.mark} to new members]{.underline} and
credibility as a force for good [**[is damaged]{.mark}** by the
perception that it is [unable to keep its]{.mark} own [house in
order]{.mark}.]{.underline} National interests are pursued at the
expense of the collective good.

**[U.S. LEADERSHIP]{.underline}**

[The **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [decreases]{.mark} its
[defense budget]{.mark}]{.underline} even [as it [faces]{.mark} a more
**[demanding security environment]{.mark}**]{.underline} outside of
Europe. It [[loses patience with]{.mark} European [allies'
failure]{.mark} to assume their share of the burden]{.underline},
[[stand up to Russia and China]{.mark}, or [allow NATO to adapt]{.mark}
to address new and emerging security threats. The United States comes to
view NATO]{.underline} not as a force multiplier for U.S. influence and
interests, but rather [as a burden and constraint;]{.underline} it
withdraws significant forces from Europe and reduces its financial,
force, and capability contributions to NATO.

**[RESPONSIBILITY SHARING]{.underline}**

The [**[economic fallout]{.mark}** from the Covid-19]{.underline}
pandemic [[brings an end to]{.mark} consecutive years of [growth in
NATO]{.mark} defense [spending]{.mark}. Only countries with sizeable
domestic defense industries]{.underline} (i.e., the United States,
France, and United Kingdom) [maintain higher levels of
spending]{.underline}, and the [majority]{.underline} of this is
[directed not to meeting NATO requirements but rather to sustaining
their own industries]{.underline}. As a result, [**[China and
Russia]{.mark} outpace most allies** with respect to emerging defense
technologies]{.underline} like that make use of innovations in
artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Angered by the lack of
progress on arms control and shocked by the escalating cost of nuclear
modernization programs, [[Congress refuses]{.mark} to fully fund
[nuclear modernization]{.mark}, [undermining]{.mark} extended
**[deterrence]{.mark}** and forcing the United States to reconsider its
nuclear posture in Europe.]{.underline}

**[NATIONAL DYNAMICS]{.underline}**

[In response to the economic downturn, [countries become]{.mark} more
**[nationalist and protectionist]{.mark}**. National leaders [searching
for a **scapegoat**]{.mark} for their economic and social woes
[blame]{.mark} multinational [organizations]{.mark}, claiming that they

[[ignore]{.mark} their [obligations]{.mark}]{.underline} to

Torrey Taussig, 7-10-2018, \"An inconvenient truth: Addressing
democratic backsliding within NATO,\" Brookings,
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/07/10/an-inconvenient-truth-addressing-democratic-backsliding-within-nato/)HS

There is also [**significant democratic backsliding** among NATO member
states]{.underline}. The cast of illiberal characters---who are leading
the charge in the wrong direction---[includes the recently reelected and
empowered Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his Justice and
Development Party]{.underline} (AKP), [Jaroslaw Kaczynski's Law and
Justice (PiS) Party in Poland, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán
and the ruling Fidesz Party. Each]{.underline} has proven more than
[willing to repress free media, dismantle checks and balances, demonize
political opposition, clamp down on civil society, and diminish the rule
of law]{.underline}. America's [democratic system and norms under
President Trump are also under duress]{.underline}; as a result, Freedom
House downgraded the country's score on the basis of weakening political
rights and civil liberties.

Despite these alarming developments, [NATO leaders have relegated
democratic backsliding to the backburner]{.underline}. Opponents of
making the case for democracy within NATO might argue [that pushing
Ankara, Warsaw, and Budapest]{.underline} too hard on their commitments
to good governance will [**exacerbate** already tense **divisions** in
the alliance]{.underline}. Others might say that Russia would be the
prime beneficiary of a contentious democracy discussion at NATO. Yet
this is a counterproductive approach with current and potential costs to
NATO's future. Here are three security-based reasons why the United
States and NATO should care about democratic backsliding, and actions
the alliance can take to address them.

[Russia is already benefiting from and effectively leveraging its
relationships with Hungary and Turkey to exacerbate discord within
Europe and NATO. Viktor Orbán and Vladimir Putin see one another as
allies]{.underline} in their disdain for the European Union and [Orbán
has courted Russian financial and political support as he builds an
illiberal democracy in Hungary. Russian propaganda also finds fertile
ground in Hungarian media.]{.underline} A 2018 Senate Foreign Relations
Committee report noted that Russian state-owned media content "by
Sputnik and RT is widely referenced by pro-government news sources in
Hungary." The report cited Orbán as the EU and NATO's most supportive
leader of Putin's worldview and leadership. Acting as the Russian
"camel's nose under the tent," Orbán is thwarting Ukraine and NATO's
partnership efforts by blocking the Ukraine-NATO Commission from meeting
at the upcoming summit.

In Turkey, [Erdoğan has rattled the NATO alliance by pursuing a deal to
purchase the S-400 missile system from Russia.]{.underline} In addition
to hurting NATO's ability to cooperate on security, the system is also
not compatible with NATO's defenses. Through arms and energy deals,
[Putin uses Turkey as a wedge to divide NATO. Similarly, Erdoğan might
see his deals with Putin as a way to free Turkey from Western
leverage,]{.underline} particularly as European states push back on his
brand of authoritarian politics by cutting EU pre-accession funds. After
winning the recent twin parliamentary and presidential elections, an
[emboldened Erdoğan will likely become an even more problematic partner
for NATO.]{.underline}

Other [illiberal and populist governments, including Italy's new
anti-establishment government, could follow suit in enhancing their
partnerships with Russia]{.underline}, creating future
intelligence-sharing and cohesion problems for the alliance. [President
**Putin is building ties** with illiberal leaders across Europe while
attacking fundamental elements of Western democracies, including
electoral process and open information spaces.]{.underline}

There is a strong link between democratic governance and security gains.
Liberal democracies have historically been less likely to experience
intra- and interstate conflict, generate refugees, and harbor violent
extremists. They are also better at maintaining transparent
institutions, civilian control of the military and intelligence
services, and working together on confidence-building measures, all of
which are core features of NATO's ability to collectively defend its
members. On the other hand, corruption and insecurity grow under
politicized institutions and poor rule of law. This hurts NATO's renewed
efforts to combat terrorism, as military and security communities have
long acknowledged the connection between corruption and the existence of
criminal networks, traffickers, and terrorists within state borders.

[Corruption also opens space for **Russian kleptocratic networks** close
to Putin to operate and **gain influence**]{.underline}. For example, in
2014 [Orbán awarded Rosatom, a Russian state-owned nuclear company, the
sole contract to build two nuclear plants in Hungary]{.underline} in
exchange for a 10 billion euro loan from Moscow. The Hungarian
parliament, dominated by Orbán's Fidesz Party, then passed a rushed vote
to keep data from the nuclear deal confidential for 30 years in the name
of "national security." The deal diminished transparent economic
competition within the European Union and solidified Hungary and
Russia's energy ties.

Distrust among allies hurts alliance interoperability. The PiS Party's
assault on independent media and the Constitutional Court, including
efforts last week to summarily force out 27 Polish Supreme Court
justices, have isolated Poland from France and Germany, diminishing
trust among the European nations. This could make it increasingly
difficult for Washington to gain consensus on joint decisions,
communications, and operations. If NATO is dedicated to building
resiliency along Russia's periphery by placing multi-national battalions
in Poland, then it should not ignore the accountable institutions that
would strengthen this joint effort.

What can NATO do to counter democratic backsliding within its ranks?
After a troubling G-7 meeting in Canada, the upcoming NATO summit in
Brussels may be a hair twisting exercise in alliance management. Muted
[cohesion, however, is not enough to address the anti-democratic trends
**tearing apart the fabric** of Europe and NATO]{.underline}. Strong
actions and words are needed to counter this democratic crisis.

First, in fighting for the relevance of NATO's Article V promise of
collective defense, we should not forget about NATO's other founding
articles, including Article II: states' promise to strengthen free
institutions within their borders. We should also recall the central
governance requirements that states needed to meet in order to join the
alliance, including rules around civilian control of the military,
legislative monitoring, and transparency of arms procurements---all
democratic foundations that make the alliance stronger.

In practice, NATO needs a new mechanism to hold members accountable when
there is democratic backsliding and when the principles of the
Washington Treaty, NATO's founding document, are violated. Celeste
Wallender, President Obama's special assistant to the president and
senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs at the National
Security Council, argues persuasively for several measures here. As she
and others have noted, [NATO currently has no options to suspend, expel,
or penalize a NATO member,]{.underline} for example Hungary, for
violating a core tenet of the alliance's democratic values. [There is
not even a proper venue at NATO]{.underline}---for example the North
Atlantic Council (NAC), NATO's main decisionmaking body---[to raise
matters that some consider a direct threat to the alliance's core
principles.]{.underline} The NAC already has over a dozen committees,
but none deal directly with democratic backsliding and human rights
violations in the alliance.

#### Turkey

**Erlanger 20** Chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe for The New
York Times (Steven Erlanger, 8-3-2020, \"Turkish Aggression Is NATO's
'Elephant in the Room',\" New York Times,
<https://www.nytimes.com/202>0/ 08/03/world/europe/turkey-nato)HS

BRUSSELS --- The [warships were escorting a vessel suspected of
smuggling weapons into Libya, violating a United Nations arms
embargo.]{.underline} Challenged by a French naval frigate, the warships
went to battle alert. Outnumbered and outgunned, the French frigate
withdrew.

But this [mid-June naval showdown in the Mediterranean was not a
confrontation of enemies. The antagonists were France and Turkey, fellow
members of NATO,]{.underline} sworn to protect one another.

A [similarly hostile encounter between Turkey and a fellow NATO member
happened just two weeks ago, when Turkish warplanes buzzed an area near
the Greek island of Rhodes after Greek warships went on alert over
Turkey's intent to drill for undersea natural gas there.]{.underline}

[Turkey --- increasingly assertive, ambitious and authoritarian --- has
become "the elephant in the room" for NATO]{.underline}, European
diplomats say. But it is a matter, they say, that [few want to
discuss.]{.underline}

A NATO member since 1952, [Turkey is too big, powerful and strategically
important]{.underline} --- it is the crossroads of Europe and Asia ---
[to allow an open confrontation]{.underline}, alliance officials
suggest.

Turkey has dismissed any criticism of its behavior as unjustified. But
some [NATO ambassadors believe that Turkey now represents an open
challenge to the group's]{.underline} democratic values and its
[collective defense.]{.underline}

[A more aggressive, nationalist and religious Turkey is increasingly at
odds with its Western allies over Libya, Syria, Iraq, Russia and the
energy resources of the eastern Mediterranean]{.underline}. Turkey's
tilt toward strongman rule after 17 years with President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan at the helm also has [unsettled other NATO members.]{.underline}

"It's getting [hard to describe Turkey as an ally]{.underline} of the
U.S.," said Philip H. Gordon, a foreign policy adviser and former
assistant secretary of state who dealt with Turkey during the Obama
administration.

Despite that, [Turkey is getting a kind of free pass]{.underline},
analysts say, its path having been cleared by a lack of consistent U.S.
leadership, exacerbated by President Trump's contempt for NATO and his
clear admiration for Mr. Erdogan.

"You can't say what U.S. policy on Turkey is, and you can't even see
where Trump is," Mr. Gordon said. "It's a big dilemma for U.S. policy,
where we seem to disagree strategically on nearly every issue."

Those [strategic divides are proliferating. They include Turkey's
support for different armed groups in Syria]{.underline}; its 2019
purchase of a [sophisticated Russian antiaircraft system over fierce
objections by the United States and other NATO members; its violation of
the arms embargo in Libya; its aggressive drilling in the eastern
Mediterranean; its constant demonization of Israel; and its increasing
use of state-sponsored disinformation.]{.underline}

But [NATO officials' general meekness in standing up to Turkey has not
helped]{.underline}, analysts say, pointing to the group's
secretary-general, Jens [Stoltenberg]{.underline}, whose job is to keep
the 30-nation alliance together, but who is considered [excessively
tolerant of both American and Turkish misbehavior.]{.underline}

The last serious discussion of Turkey's policies among NATO ambassadors
was late last year, despite the purchase of the antiaircraft system, the
S-400.

Other countries, like Hungary and Poland, also fall short on the values
scale, argued Nicholas Burns, a former NATO ambassador now at Harvard.
But only Turkey blocks key alliance business.

NATO operates by consensus, so [Turkish objections can stall nearly any
policy, and its diplomats are both diligent and knowledgeable, "on top
of every ball,"]{.underline} as one NATO official said. France has also
used its effective veto to pursue national interests, but never to
undermine collective defense, NATO ambassadors say. But [Turkey has
blocked NATO partnerships for countries it dislikes, like Israel,
Armenia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.]{.underline}

More seriously, for many months [Turkey blocked a NATO plan for the
defense of Poland and the Baltic nations,]{.underline} which all border
Russia. And Turkey wanted NATO to list various armed Kurdish groups,
which have fought for their independence, as terrorist groups ---
something that NATO does not do.

Some of these same Kurdish groups are also Washington's best allies in
its fight against Islamic State and Al Qaeda in Syria and Iraq.

A [deal was supposedly worked out at the last NATO summit meeting in
December in London, but Turkey created bureaucratic
complications]{.underline}, and it was only in late June that Turkey
relented --- after considerable pressure from official Washington, which
has lost patience with Mr. Erdogan and is infuriated by his insistence
on buying the S-400.

If deployed, the S-[400 would put Russian engineers inside a NATO air
defense system, giving them valuable insights into the alliance's
strengths while threatening to diminish the capability of the expensive
fifth-generation fighter, the F-35.]{.underline}

The assumption is that Mr. Erdogan, who has grown significantly more
suspicious since a failed 2016 coup against him, wants to be able to
shoot down American and Israeli planes like the ones his own air force
used in the coup attempt.

"Every time we discuss Russia" in NATO, "everyone thinks of the S-400
and no one says anything," said one European diplomat, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. "[It's a major
breach in NATO air defense, and it's not even discussed."]{.underline}

Instead, [NATO assumes that talks between Washington and Ankara will
somehow handle the problem]{.underline}. But Washington is divided, and
Mr. Erdogan talks only to Mr. Trump.

Yet the confusion is not simply Washington's, said Amanda Sloat, a
former deputy assistant secretary of state who dealt with Turkey in the
Obama State Department and wrote a recent essay with Mr. Gordon. [The
European Union also has no clear policy on Turkey or Libya]{.underline},
she said.

Turkey has pursued its own national interests in northern Syria, where
it now has more than 10,000 troops, and in Libya, where its military
support for a failing government helped turn the tide in return for a
share in Libya's rich energy resources.

It was near Libya in June that three Turkish warships confronted the
French frigate.

While the European Union has a mission to help enforce the arms embargo
on Libya, NATO does not. The frigate, the Courbet, was engaged in a
different NATO mission aimed at migration flows, but since [Turkey and
France support different sides in the Libyan civil war, the
confrontation between NATO allies was troubling.]{.underline}

Turkey said the ship was carrying aid rather than arms, and has denied
harassing the Courbet. NATO officials say that its military committee is
investigating and that the evidence is not as clear-cut as the French
suggest.

Still, President Emmanuel [Macron]{.underline} of France has [used the
clash as another moment to assert that NATO is nearing "brain
death,"]{.underline} because [it seems incapable of reining in Turkey or
acting in a coordinated political way.]{.underline}

His first accusation also involved Turkey, when Mr. Trump, after a call
with Mr. Erdogan last October, unilaterally decided to pull U.S. troops
out of northern Syria, where NATO is fighting the Islamic State, leaving
the French and other allies exposed. Ultimately, the Pentagon persuaded
Mr. Trump to leave some American troops there.

French-Turkish tensions at NATO date to the 2011 decision to intervene
against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, noted Ivo Daalder, who was
then the American ambassador to NATO.

[France]{.underline}, with its policy of secularism, [fears that Mr.
Erdogan's reinsertion of Islam into politics will spread in North
Africa, encourage Islamist militias and damage France's]{.underline}
"sphere of influence," said Soner Cagaptay, the director of the Turkish
Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "They
are quite worried."

The [latest flash point is over Turkey's demand to share in discoveries
of natural gas]{.underline} made in 2015 [in the eastern Mediterranean,
which led to deals and alliances among Greece, Cyprus, Israel and
Egypt.]{.underline}

[Maritime claims are disputed]{.underline}, and Mr. [Erdogan
complained]{.underline} in June that "[their aim was to imprison our
country,]{.underline} which has the longest coastline in the
Mediterranean, into a coastal strip from which you can only catch fish
with a rod."

He then [sent survey and drilling ships to explore off Cyprus, prompting
European sanctions, and said he would do the same near Rhodes, bringing
the Greeks to threaten warfare.]{.underline} Last week, Chancellor
Angela Merkel of Germany got Mr. Erdogan to hold off while talks
proceed.

While many looked to Turkey as a moderate democratic model during the
Arab spring a decade ago, Turkey is a different country under Mr.
Erdogan, who has mobilized the more religious voters in the countryside.

A devout Muslim, [Mr. Erdogan has become more nationalist and
authoritarian]{.underline}, especially in the aftermath of the 2016 coup
attempt, when he purged and jailed many Turkish secularists, judges,
journalists and military commanders.

He has broken definitively with Turkish secularism, symbolized by his
recent decision to turn Hagia Sophia from a museum back into a mosque.
He has pushed hard into the region with a neo-Ottoman ambition,
downgrading older alliances to press Turkish interests.

#### Trump's second term

**Drezner 22** Professor of international politics at the Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, Daniel(5-21-22, "What
would Trump's second-term foreign policy look like?", Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/04/21/what-would-trumps-second-term-foreign-policy-look-like/)HS

Here's what I told the New Republic in full:

It took Trump almost all of his four years to figure out just how some
of the levers of government worked. By the end, however, he had begun to
realize the power of personnel moves and executive action, particularly
in foreign policy. So [if Trump wins in 2024, I would anticipate that he
would pursue his foreign policy vision in an unconstrained
manner.]{.underline} This would [include U.S. withdrawals from
NATO]{.underline} and security agreements with Japan and South Korea for
starters. [Withdrawal from the World Trade Organization would also
happen.]{.underline} There would also be a [wholesale purge of civil
servants]{.underline} in national security bureaucracies --- essentially
what happened at the State Department under Pompeo, but on steroids.
Trump's political appointments --- assuming GOP control of the Senate
and continued GOP subservience to Trump --- would make his subpar
first-term appointees look like a team of George Kennans in contrast.

I am making a two-step argument: first, that [as disorganized as Trump
was during his first term, toward the end he was willing to fire those
on his national security team who disagreed with him]{.underline}.
Indeed, [Trump's lame duck period mostly consisted of him engaging in
wholesale personnel transfers at the Pentagon in a last-ditch effort to
withdraw U.S. forces from Europe the Middle East,]{.underline} and
elsewhere before his term in office expired.

Trump might be an immature, impulsive leader with a short attention
span, but even he can move down a learning curve. It's safe to assume
that [he would only nominate individuals as pliant as Kash Patel or Ric
Grenell in any second term.]{.underline}

Second, if Trump had more success in appointing only the most loyal
toadies to his national security team in 2025, what would he want to do?
Pretty much what I said in that paragraph.

[It is not hard to find evidence for this claim]{.underline} from
Trump's own staffers and subordinates. In early 2019 Julian Barnes and
Helene Cooper reported: "Senior administration officials told The New
York Times that several times over the course of 2018, Mr. [Trump
privately said he wanted to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization]{.underline}." They elaborated that "in the days around a
tumultuous NATO summit meeting last summer ... Mr[. Trump told his top
national security officials that he did not see the point of the
military alliance, which he presented as a drain on the United
States."]{.underline}

In their book "I Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump's Catastrophic Final
Year," my Washington Post colleagues Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker
wrote: "Trump had privately indicated that [he would seek to withdraw
from NATO and to blow up the U.S. alliance with South Korea, should he
win reelection]{.underline}." When his secretary of defense warned him
not to do these things before the 2020 election, Trump responded, "Yeah,
the second term. We'll do it in the second term."

And just last month, [Trump's former national security adviser John
Bolton told The Post, "In a second Trump term, I think he may well have
withdrawn from NATO]{.underline}. And I think \[Russian President
Vladimir\] Putin was waiting for that."

Little wonder that in his first joint address to Congress, President
[Biden said: "In my conversations with world leaders ---]{.underline}
and I've spoken to over 38, 40 of them now --- I've made it known ---
I've made it known that America is back. And you know what they say?
[The comment that I hear most of all from them is they say, 'We see
America is back but for how long? But for how long?' "]{.underline}

### EXT Sustainability\-\--Trump wins

#### Policy and midterms don't matter\-\--Trump is still crushing in the primary

**Easley 6-8** Senior editor at Morning Consult. Leads coverage of U.S.
politics, geopolitics and foreign affairs. (Cameron Easley, 6-8-2022,
\"Despite Stumbles as Kingmaker, Trump Is Still Dominating the 2024 GOP
Primary Field,\" Morning Consult,
https://morningconsult.com/2022/06/08/trump-2024-gop-primary-field/)HS

Former President Donald [Trump's]{.underline} kingmaker status may be
under scrutiny following a spate of recent losses by his endorsees in
2022 midterm election primaries, but a new Morning Consult/Politico
survey suggests he [remains firmly in control of the millions of
Republican voters nationwide who would ultimately matter most come
2024.]{.underline}

[Trump is outpacing the 2024 GOP primary field]{.underline}

In the June 4-5 survey, [53% of GOP voters said they would vote for
Trump over at least a dozen other]{.underline} potential
[candidates]{.underline} if the 2024 Republican presidential primary
were held today --- down just 3 percentage points from his potential
vote share in a survey conducted before 2022's primary season heated up.

Florida Gov. Ron [DeSantis]{.underline} --- who for the second year
running defeated Trump in an unscientific straw poll of conservative
activists at the Western Conservative Summit in Colorado over the
weekend --- saw his support tick up from 13% to [16%.]{.underline}

Once again, former Vice President Mike [Pence]{.underline} finished
third in the latest Morning Consult survey of the hypothetical primary
field, seeing his support rise from 10% to [13%]{.underline}.

Nikki Haley, a former Trump administration official and South Carolina
governor, was the top choice of 4% of respondents, followed by Sens. Ted
Cruz (Texas) and Mitt Romney (Utah) at 3% each.

The remaining slate of potential candidates --- which included Sens. Tom
Cotton of Arkansas, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Tim Scott of South Carolina
and Rick Scott of Florida and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ---
all pulled in 1% or less.

Trump's grip on the Republican Party

While political observers and operatives have taken a keen interest in
the win-loss record of his endorsees in recent weeks, the [latest survey
is just another reminder of an uncomfortable truth facing the former
president's would-be challengers: It matters little that Trump has even
a below-average endorsement victory rate as long as he remains the top
2024 choice for Republican primary voters around the
country.]{.underline}

#### Trump is itching to get back in the cage with Biden

**Allen 6-5** senior national politics reporter for NBC News (Jonathan
Allen, 6-5-2022, \"Is Trump on the brink of another run for
president?,\" NBC News,
https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-brink-rcna31774)HS

WASHINGTON --- Former [President Donald Trump is bored at Mar-a-Lago and
anxious to get back in the political arena --- as a
candidate]{.underline}, not a kingmaker --- according to his advisers,
who are divided over whether he should launch a third bid for the
presidency as early as this summer.

While [many Trump confidants believe he should wait until after
November\'s midterm elections]{.underline} --- and caution that he has
not yet made a final decision about running --- [some say he could move
more quickly to harness supporters and deny fuel to the busload of GOP
hopefuls in his rearview mirror.]{.underline}

\"I've laid out my case on why I think he should do it,\" said longtime
Trump adviser Jason Miller, who traveled with the former president to a
rally in Wyoming over Memorial Day weekend. \"I think that there being
clarity about what his intentions are \[is important\] so he can start
building that operation while it's still fresh in people's minds and
they're still active --- a lot of that can be converted into 2024
action.\"

A second [adviser, who believes Trump should pause until the more
traditional post-midterm period, said the former president]{.underline},
famous for his lack of impulse control, [is nonetheless likely to jump
in \"sooner rather than later.\"]{.underline}

Both said Trump has gathered a wide range of views.

[One question is \"whether he can sort of suppress his excitement about
a 2024 rematch and not, say, go ahead and put that statement out ... and
waits for a big event,]{.underline} a big speech to do it,\" the second
adviser said. \"A betting person says he's doing it, and he also wants
to crowd out the rest of the field.\"

Two people in Trump\'s orbit told NBC News they had been asked
informally to hold July 4 as a date for a possible announcement, but
Miller --- noting that Trump hasn\'t yet decided to run --- said it is
\"not true\" that the day has been reserved, even unofficially, for a
launch.

Without specifically addressing the question of timing, Trump spokesman
Taylor Budowich said in a text exchange with NBC News that he sees
growing public appetite for a Trump comeback.

"[America was strong, prosperous and greatly respected under President
Trump, and that's why he continues to have unprecedented strength
through his endorsement record and the demand for his leadership has
never been higher]{.underline}," Budowich said.

Trump\'s decision, and its timing, promise to define the playing field
for Republicans\' efforts to oust President Joe Biden in 2024, and there
is reason for him to feel greater urgency in recent weeks.

While he casts a longer shadow over his party than that of any former
president in modern times, the footsteps of 2024 Republican hopefuls are
growing louder. Several of them have visited early primary states,
endorsed candidates in the midterms or delivered high-profile speeches
designed to elevate their standing in the party.

That pack includes Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike
Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former U.N. Ambassador
Nikki Haley, and Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Ted
Cruz, R-Texas.

There is also an emerging dynamic in which his favorites in
multi-candidate races often fail --- win or lose --- to finish with as
much as one-third of the vote. Some Republican operatives see that as a
sign that his influence on the GOP electorate has diminished, to say
nothing of his standing with a broader public that voted him out of
office less than two years ago.

Perhaps more important, [Trump is frustrated by the ennui of engaging
mostly through midterm endorsements]{.underline} for candidates he
hardly knows, especially when --- as has happened in several recent
high-profile primaries --- they lose.

But as much as [Trump is tantalized by President Joe Biden\'s struggles
in office]{.underline} --- and his own impatience --- there are plenty
of reasons to hold off, Trump allies and Republican strategists say.

If Trump announces a bid, his campaign committee will be subject to
hard-money fundraising limits and a technical ban on coordinating with
his Save America PAC. He would also undoubtedly focus public attention
away from Republicans running in midterm races, potentially hurting the
party\'s candidates in swing districts and states. And he might
inadvertently aid Biden by giving the president a contrast point.

\"[The clearest, cleanest path is to have a cage-match
rematch]{.underline},\" the second adviser said. \"If you have that
rematch too early, it could actually help Biden a little bit. \... Trump
in modest doses has been good for Trump.\"

There is precedent for a once and possibly future president, and for the
prospect of a Trump-Biden rematch. In 1892, former President Grover
Cleveland defeated President Benjamin Harrison, who had unseated
Cleveland in 1888.

That was one of six times in U.S. history that a candidate tried to
unseat the incumbent president who beat him four years earlier, not
counting the elections George Washington won before parties were
organized. The first was in 1800, when Thomas Jefferson avenged his loss
at the hands of President John Adams. The most recent: Dwight
Eisenhower\'s consecutive wins over Democrat Adlai Stevenson II in 1952
and 1956.

[In four of the six contests, the challenger won.]{.underline}

In recent months, [Trump has teased audiences at his rallies by
suggesting that he will, in fact, run in 2024.]{.underline}

\"[The truth is: I ran twice, I won twice and I did much better the
second time]{.underline},\" Trump said at a March rally in Georgia,
repeating the lie that he was victorious in 2020. \"And now we just may
have to do it again.\"

For now, he is soliciting and receiving counsel, both on whether he
should run and, if he does, when he should jump in.

\"He always seeks advice from the unlikeliest of places and a very wide
pool of voices,\" said Miller, who declined to go into the details of
his own discussions with Trump on the matter. \"I very much want him to
run again in 2024.\"

#### Sleepy Joe's submission to the RADICAL LEFT makes a Donald J Trump victory inevitable

**Thiessen 6-14** Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and the
former chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush. (Marc Thiessen,
6-14-2022, \"Opinion,\" Washington Post, https://www.washingtonpost

They chose Joe Biden as their nominee precisely because he presented
himself as an inoffensive, genial moderate who was least likely to drive
away swing voters wary of the Democrats' leftward turn. But [instead of
governing as a centrist and uniter, as he promised, Biden has become
captive to his party's progressive wing. His leftward lurch is providing
no safe harbor for voters who don't like Trump but also don't like the
left's agenda.]{.underline} It has also [unleashed a series of
catastrophes that has left him less popular around the 500-day mark of
his presidency than any modern president before him.]{.underline}

Biden says today's GOP "isn't your grandfather's Republican Party."
Well, this isn't your grandfather's Democratic Party, either. In just a
few decades, we've gone from a Democratic president who promised that
"the era of big government is over" to a Democratic president who tried
to enact the highest sustained levels of federal spending since World
War II while collecting more tax revenue as a share of the economy than
at almost any point in the past century. [That's not what Americans
voted for]{.underline} in 2020.

One of Biden's first acts as president was to pass a \$1.9 trillion
social spending bill disguised as covid relief, which [helped unleash
the worst inflation in more than 40 years]{.underline}. Don't take my
word for it. Post contributing columnist Lawrence H. Summers, who served
as director of the National Economic Council under President Barack
Obama, warned in February 2021 that Biden's plan would "set off
inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation." And
former Obama administration Treasury official Steven Rattner recently
explained that Biden's plan "overstimulated this economy" by "putting
too much money in people's pockets, which created a lot of this
inflation." Indeed, Rattner told MSNBC's "Morning Joe," things would
have been even worse if Biden had succeeded in passing his Build Back
Better social spending bill. "In an ironic way, you almost have to thank
Joe Manchin for blocking that," Rattner said of the Democratic senator
of West Virginia, "because \$6.5 trillion of spending in this economy
would make these \[inflation\] numbers look small."

That's not all. [Biden's war on fossil fuels helped drive gas prices to
record highs,]{.underline} while [putting America at risk of widespread
power outages because his radical green policies mean we might not have
enough power to get through the summer heat wave]{.underline}. His
radical immigration policies have helped unleash the worst border crisis
in U.S. history. And the [flood of illegal drugs surging across the
southern border, together with Democratic soft-on-crime policies, helped
fuel the worst crime wave in many cities since the 1990s. Never have
Americans been confronted with so many failures of big government in so
short a time.]{.underline}

Biden's serial catastrophes are [creating the perfect conditions for a
Trump comeback. Democrats know it and are starting to
panic]{.underline}. The New York Times reports that many party members
now see Biden "as an anchor that should be cut loose in 2024." Instead
of blaming the disasters his left-wing policies unleashed, they blame
his failure to pass even more "big-ticket legislation on signature
Democratic issues" for his unpopularity --- as if more spending leading
to more inflation would have made him more popular.

Wrong. The problem is [Biden's failure to deliver on the central promise
of his campaign, which was to restore normalcy, reach across the aisle,
compromise and unite the country behind a moderate, bipartisan agenda.
Americans voted for Biden expecting him to hew a centrist course, not to
impose a radical progressive agenda on the nation. Unless Democrats are
ready to change those policies and move to the center, getting rid of
Biden won't make a difference.]{.underline}

But Democrats seem unwilling to do that. Instead, they are focusing on
the events of Jan. 6, 2021, in an effort to re-toxify Trump for the
electorate. Never mind that the Senate already held bipartisan hearings
and issued a bipartisan report on the events of that day, in addition to
Trump's impeachment hearings and trial. The Democrat-run committee, by
holding its first prime-time hearing on the Capitol riot last week, sent
the American people a clear signal: Democrats consider this the single
most important issue facing the country --- more important than
inflation, record gas prices, the border catastrophe, the crime wave or
the baby formula shortage. Americans can be forgiven for asking: Why are
these people rehashing Jan. 6 when I have to choose between filling my
gas tank and feeding my family?

The answer is: Because [they want to remind voters how much they hate
Trump. Sorry, but that won't be enough when every visit to the gas
station and grocery store reminds them why they dislike
Biden.]{.underline} If Democrats change their candidate without changing
their policies, then [they are paving the way for the 45th president to
become the 47th.]{.underline}

### EXT Sustainability-Trump Withdraws

#### The whole white house knew trump was gonna pull out

**Alfaro 22** (Mariana Alfaro, 3-4-2022, \"Bolton says Trump might have
pulled the U.S. out of NATO if he had been reelected,\" Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/04/bolton-says-trump-might-have-pulled-us-out-nato-if-he-had-been-reelected/)HS

Former [national security adviser John Bolton told The Washington Post
Friday that he thinks former president Donald Trump would have pulled
the United States out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had he
been reelected in 2020.]{.underline}

Bolton, in an interview with Post opinions editor at large Michael
Duffy, [said the former president came close to pulling the United
States out of NATO in 2018,]{.underline} a claim he originally made in a
memoir published in 2020. In his book, Bolton wrote that he had to
convince Trump not to quit NATO in the middle of a 2018 summit.

On Friday, Bolton, who served as a top Trump adviser from 2018 to 2019,
offered more details on their conversations that day, saying he "had my
heart in my throat at that NATO meeting."

"I didn't know what the president would do," Bolton said. "He called me
up to his seat seconds before he gave the speech. And I said, look, go
right up to the line, but don't go over it. I sat back down. I had no
idea what he'd do."

Bolton said he thought Trump would "put his foot over it, but [at least
he didn't withdraw then]{.underline}."

"In a second Trump term, I think he may well have withdrawn from NATO,"
Bolton said. "And I think \[Russian President Vladimir\] Putin was
waiting for that."

White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Friday responded to Bolton's
comments, saying they highlighted "another reason the American people
are grateful --- the majority of the American people --- that President
Biden has not taken a page out of his predecessor's playbook as it
relates to global engagement and global leadership, because certainly we
could be in a different place."

"I mean, there's no question that the strength and unity of NATO has
been a powerful force in this moment," Psaki added.

In a statement, Taylor Budowich, a spokesman for Trump, dismissed
Bolton's criticism and said the former adviser "is only happy when
America is at war."

"President Trump led America into one of the most peaceful times in U.S.
history," Budowich said. "John Bolton is just mad he was fired."

Bolton's remarks Friday offer new insights into Trump's views on NATO.
During his presidency[, Trump frequently sought to undermine the
alliance, accusing its members of being "delinquents" and repeatedly
telling aides he wanted to leave it. According to the New York Times,
Trump told his top national security officials that he did not
understand why the military alliance existed, and often described it as
a drain on the U.S.]{.underline}

Retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly, [one of Trump's former chiefs of
staff, has also been described as saying that "one of the most difficult
tasks he faced with Trump was trying to stop him from pulling out of
NATO."]{.underline}

NATO EXPANSION---TOWARD OR AGAINST RUSSIA?

[A]{.underline}nother [constant feature of U.S. policy toward Russia has
been the **primacy of NATO as the cornerstone** of the post--Cold War
European security architecture, including its **expansion to some of the
former Soviet states**]{.underline}. Since the end of the Cold War,
[NATO enlargement has been the **principal instrument of U.S. security
policy**]{.underline} in Europe and Eurasia. It reflects a U.S.
commitment to a whole, free, democratic, and peaceful Europe, as well as
a view that the alliance should serve as the vehicle of the continent's
post--Cold War transformation. What went largely unnoticed were Moscow's
warnings beginning in 1994 that a "whole Europe" was not compatible with
an expanding NATO, which would never be open to Russia.

[Although NATO's expansion has **not necessarily been directed against
Russia**, it has negatively affected the Kremlin's assessment of U.S.
motivations and intentions and has been met with strong
**objections**]{.underline} from Russians [across the political
spectrum. NATO enlargement also has shaped Russia's perceptions of its
**own security requirements**, which have had a profound impact on
East-West relations]{.underline}. The issue is whether the U.S.
transatlantic commitment necessitates the alliance's continued eastward
expansion and Open Door policy.31

The Clinton administration launched NATO expansion in 1997 when it led
the alliance to offer memberships to Poland, the Czech Republic, and
Hungary---a policy that the George W. Bush and Obama administrations
subsequently embraced. In addition to extending a security umbrella to
former Soviet bloc countries, NATO membership encouraged their domestic
postcommunist transition to democracy. NATO was and remains an alliance
based on shared democratic values. And since, as Clinton declared in his
1994 State of the Union address, "democracies do not attack each other,"
the democratic transitions of new NATO members would strengthen European
security. In this way, [NATO]{.underline} also [became an instrument of
**democracy promotion**]{.underline}.32

[Russia has opposed NATO enlargement almost from the time it was raised
as a possibility]{.underline} in the early 1990s.33 [The Kremlin has
maintained that NATO's push to the east threatened Russian security and
the alliance's central role in Europe's security architecture
**marginalized Russia as a nonmember**]{.underline}. However, Russia's
objections proved insufficient to halt the alliance's expansion; most
officials and observers in the West treated such opinions as remnants of
the old Soviet ideology that Russia would shed as it transitioned to a
free market, liberal democracy. For those who did not believe that
Russia would make this transition, NATO expansion made all the more
sense as a hedge against Russia reemerging as a threat to Europe---a
prospect that loomed ever larger as Russia recovered a good measure of
its economic health, authoritarian-leaning domestic politics, and
geopolitical ambitions.34 In 2007, [Putin]{.underline} personally
[delivered an ominous warning to NATO **not to expand further
east**]{.underline}, though most in the West regarded such rhetoric as
an outdated blast from the Cold War era.35 Even though [the alliance's
**dual purpose**]{.underline}---as a defense organization and instrument
of democracy promotion---[had emerged as a **major irritant** in the
United States' relations with Russia]{.underline}, Putin's warning
effectively was dismissed.36

In 2008, [NATO promised membership to Ukraine and Georgia, crossing the
**red line**]{.underline} that Putin had drawn around the territory of
the former Soviet states.37 In the eyes of U.S. policymakers, [NATO
was]{.underline} in effect [the **only legitimate** and **viable
security manager**]{.underline} for Europe and Eurasia, and its
expansion was the only sensible policy for the entire region.38 [Putin's
response was]{.underline} the 2008 [**war with Georgia**, which
**reaffirmed the red line**]{.underline} around the former Soviet space,
stopped NATO's eastward expansion, and marked a major turning point in
European security and in the relationship between NATO and Russia.39 In
2014, the annexation of Crimea and [Russia's]{.underline} undeclared
[war against Ukraine symbolized the]{.underline} end of the post--Cold
War era and the [reemergence of a new East-West divide in
Europe]{.underline}.

Could this outcome have been avoided? NATO expansion undoubtedly
benefited many countries of Central and Eastern Europe, providing a
much-needed security framework for the region when it was left without
one in the aftermath of the Cold War. It also played an important role
in consolidating these former Soviet bloc countries' transition from
communism. But [one size **does not fit all**]{.underline}. Political
culture, history, geography, culture, and economic ties are crucially
important in shaping individual countries' trajectories. [The ties
between Georgia, Ukraine, and Russia---and Moscow's **strenuous
objections to NATO membership** for these former Soviet
republics---mattered little to the]{.underline} George W. [Bush
administration]{.underline} or to the president, who reportedly lobbied
for both countries to be admitted to NATO over many NATO allies' major
reservations.40

The promise of membership to Ukraine and Georgia---without a date or
plan for their accession---was made as a compromise between Bush and
many other NATO leaders, most notably German Chancellor Angela Merkel,
who were opposed to the idea. The promise was vague and lacked concrete
details. However, it was significant as a symbol of U.S. and NATO
commitments to the policy of NATO's eastward expansion regardless of any
red lines drawn by Putin.

When [Putin spoke about the breakup of the Soviet Union as the greatest
geopolitical catastrophe]{.underline} of the twentieth century, [his
message resonated with its intended domestic audience, reflecting
**widely held opinions**]{.underline} among average Russians---a fact
overlooked by Western policymakers.41 In retrospect, these warning signs
were harbingers of future strife. [But in the prevailing atmosphere of
the West's post--Cold War **triumphalism**]{.underline}, [they were
repeatedly **dismissed** as Russia's atavistic attachment to an
outdated, obsolete past]{.underline} rather than a vision of its
future.42

With the 2008 promise of membership to Georgia and Ukraine, the United
States led NATO across an invisible but distinct line. [None of the
other Soviet bloc countries that joined NATO]{.underline} after the Cold
War [had ties to Russia comparable to those of **Ukraine** and
**Georgia**]{.underline}. The countries of Central Europe had been part
of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Poland reemerged as an independent state
after World War I and had an adversarial relationship with the Soviet
Union until it was crushed by Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler. [The
Baltic states]{.underline} had long been part of the Russian Empire, but
they [had closer ties to the German than to the Russian
world]{.underline}. Following two decades of independence, they were
forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1939, and they viewed
Russia as an occupying power---a sentiment that survived Soviet
occupation and propelled them to freedom in the late 1980s, helping to
unravel the Soviet Union.

[Ukraine and Georgia share a **different history**]{.underline} with
Russia. Until 1991, [Ukraine had been part of imperial and]{.underline}
later [Soviet Russia for]{.underline} more than [**three hundred
years**. It was the empire's **industrial heartland**, home to its
defense industry and breadbasket, and a bridge to the outside world.
Georgia became a]{.underline} Russian [protectorate in 1783]{.underline}
and part of the Russian Empire in 1801. Unlike the Baltic countries,
[both were **integral parts of the Russian Empire**]{.underline} and the
Soviet Union, and although both countries gave rise to powerful
independence movements and played critical roles in the dissolution of
the USSR, [many of those ties survive]{.underline} to the present day,
[even after Russia went to war against both]{.underline} countries to
keep them in its orbit.43

NATO's 2008 pledge of eventual membership to Georgia and Ukraine was a
powerful restatement of its Open Door policy. For both countries---and
perhaps for other Soviet states harboring similar hopes---it was taken
as a Western promise to help them escape Russia's orbit. But for Russia,
[it was seen as another perilous sign of NATO's **boundless
ambitions**]{.underline}, and [it raised the prospect that it would
**lose control**]{.underline}, or at least immediate influence, [over
two neighbors that it saw as **critical to its security**, well-being,
and prestige as a major power.]{.underline}44 Given the alliance's
commitment to spreading democracy, [Russia also perceived its neighbors'
intended accession as a threat to its **domestic
stability**]{.underline}. Thus, the U.S. rejection of Russia's
geopolitical concerns as "atavistic" overlooked Russian sensitivities.45
Russia's response to it was an outright repudiation of several key
assumptions underpinning the original arguments for expansion---that
Russia would gradually change its views, come to share the alliance's
founding values, and eventually accept NATO's eastward push as it was
intended by its proponents; in other words, Moscow would see expansion
as a move toward Russia, rather than against it.

[Russia's opposition to NATO's eastward push **lived up to the
expectations**]{.underline} of those who argued for the expansion as a
hedge against a resurgent, irredentist Russia. However, [the architects
of expansion had **not thought through the consequences**]{.underline}
of that scenario. [Having made the promise]{.underline} of membership to
Georgia and Ukraine and encouraged their aspirations to join NATO, [the
alliance had not planned for and **did not come to their
defense**]{.underline} when the two became victims of Russian
aggression. [The alliance had made a political but not legal commitment
to their security]{.underline}. In effect, [NATO chose to hide behind
this **narrow legalistic interpretation of its
obligations**]{.underline} to member states, [rather than act upon the
expansive political commitments that permeated the **official
declarations**]{.underline} and speeches of its leaders.46

In choosing inaction, [NATO reaffirmed]{.underline} what had long been
obvious to many observers---that [it was **not committed to the
two**]{.underline} countries' security. [Russia's wars against Georgia
and Ukraine demonstrated the importance of **interests as drivers of
Russian**, U.S., and NATO actions: Russia had **more at stake in both
Georgia and Ukraine** than the United States and NATO and was **prepared
to go to war** to protect those equities]{.underline}. The United States
and its [NATO]{.underline} allies [did not see their stake in Ukraine
and Georgia]{.underline}, or their commitment to shared values, [as
important enough to warrant war]{.underline} with Russia.

Moreover, in promising membership to Georgia and Ukraine to join NATO in
the first place, the leaders of the alliance seemed to overlook the
importance of geography. Even the most ardent advocates of NATO
expansion recognize now that geographic proximity to Russia has been a
powerful obstacle to realizing their aspirations of NATO membership and
the alliance's eastward push. Russia's proximity to both countries has
endowed it with a formidable military advantage, and the alliance would
face a daunting challenge in overcoming that advantage if it chose to
come to either country's defense in a conflict with Russia. That
challenge has been made abundantly clear by the ongoing discussion among
defense experts about how the alliance would be able to defend the
Baltic states in a hypothetical future conflict with Russia, given the
latter's overwhelming geographic advantages in such a conflict.47

Finally, the [costs and benefits to the alliance of NATO]{.underline}
enlargement, [as well as the overall geopolitical context, have
**changed**]{.underline} since the early 1990s in two fundamental ways.
First, [the promise of a Europe whole, free, and at peace]{.underline}
with itself and its neighbors, which seemed within reach in the
aftermath of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, [has
been replaced with a new division in Europe between Russia and NATO.
Several countries]{.underline} that belong to neither camp [are now
stuck in a **geopolitical no man's land**]{.underline}, [unwilling to
return to Russia's sphere of influence but unable to reach out to an
alliance whose promises of protection are **vague at
best**]{.underline}. Second, at the time of NATO's first wave of
enlargement in the 1990s, the prospect of a NATO-Russia military
confrontation seemed to have been relegated to Europe's past, and NATO
was preparing to go "out of area."48 Today, NATO officials and military
planners are deeply preoccupied with augmenting capabilities to defend
alliance territory against Russian aggression. As a consequence, [the
costs of opening NATO's door to Europe's east have risen
**dramatically**]{.underline} with respect to new members and aspiring
applicants. With the alliance focused on dealing with the new division
of Europe and the adversarial relationship with Russia, [the prospect of
membership for Georgia and Ukraine has been pushed into a **distant**,
**indefinite future**.]{.underline}

#### That causes [Russia and China]{.underline} to create an [Axis of Evil]{.underline} against the US.

Putin's war against Ukraine, preceded by his demands for the United
States and its NATO allies to fundamentally alter post--Cold War
European security arrangements, has dispelled all doubts---to the extent
that any remained---about the primacy of Europe as the principal theater
where Russia's strategic interests reside, from where the principal
threats to the country's security emanate, and where the principal
efforts to defend it from those threats are concentrated. As a critical
strategic theater, Asia pales in comparison with Europe. The attack on
Ukraine demonstrates the dominance of Europe and the unimportance of
Asia---beyond China---in Russian strategic thinking.

Prior to the war in Ukraine, the view that Russian strategic thinking
was myopic and misguided was widespread in the U.S. national security
community. According to this view, the real threat to Russia in the
medium and long term would emerge from China rather than the West.
Sooner or later, the Russian strategic community would realize that. And
the sooner it could be disabused of its mistaken approach to China, the
better for the United States, whose interests would be best served by
preventing Russia from becoming an ally and force multiplier of China.
U.S. policy, therefore, should de-emphasize rivalry with Russia and
instead seek to drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing. In other
words, it was a policy prescription for a partnership with Russia on the
basis of perceiving a shared threat from China.

That prescription is no longer viable. However, for many years before
the invasion of Ukraine, Western analysts and policymakers ignored the
basic fact that [Russia's partnership with China is not a short-term
marriage of convenience but grounded in a set of coherent,
complementary, and **well-thought-out strategic rationales**. This
should have been **obvious**]{.underline} [to anyone who followed the
strategic discourse in Russia]{.underline}, read its national security
documents, and sought to understand the basics of its domestic politics,
national security decisionmaking, and economy.

One striking aspect of the Russian national security discourse largely
overlooked by many in the U.S. strategic community is its all-consuming
preoccupation with perceived threats from the West. [Insecurity
vis-à-vis the West has been the **defining feature of official security
documents**]{.underline} since the 1990s, when the United States and
Europe considered the Cold War to be over. In Russia, by contrast, [the
West's security policy has always been viewed as a
**continuation**]{.underline} in one form or another [of its Cold War
policies]{.underline}, initially as a "Cold War light" version, but
increasingly as a manifestation of the West's hostile intentions toward
Russia.

Another striking aspect of Russian national security documents that has
been overlooked is the absence in them of any references to China as a
challenge, let alone a potential source of threats to Russia. [As alarm
about China and its growing ambitions]{.underline} on the world stage
[became louder]{.underline} in the United States, [Russia's national
security documents **avoided any mention**]{.underline} of the country
other than as a partner, [and instead increasingly concentrated on the
West as the **principal source of threats**]{.underline}. These
documents, however, reflect the actual thinking of the country's
national security leadership and its strategic posture.

This paper first provides an overview of these documents, their
evolution since the breakup of the Soviet Union, and the strategic
backdrop to that evolution. It then focuses on the treatment of China in
these documents and explores the reasons why they have ignored the
country as a threat or a challenge to Russian national security. Next,
the paper explores the unofficial Russian debate about China, considers
the practical manifestations in Russian defense policy of its
Euro-centric preoccupation, and concludes with implications for the
United States.

IT IS ABOUT EUROPE

[The war in Ukraine is **but the latest conflict** in the long historic
cycle of war and peace in the relationship between Russia and the rest
of Europe]{.underline}. Virtually [the entire history of Russia as a
modern state is one of wars waged in the **European
theater**]{.underline}---against Sweden, the Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth, Prussia, Great Britain, France, Turkey, Austria, Germany,
and so on.

The history of [Russia's relationship with Asia contains **nothing
similar**]{.underline}. Compared to the major European wars, [the
conquest of Siberia was a series of **skirmishes**]{.underline}, few of
which are recognized as milestones in Russian history. Two major
military undertakings stand out---the lost Russo-Japanese war of
1904--1905 and the August 1945 campaign against Japan in Manchuria,
which is extolled in Russian historiography as the final chapter of the
Second World War. The latter lasted just a few weeks and is generally
considered a footnote to the main war effort in the European theater,
where the victory is celebrated on May 9 as the end of the Great
Patriotic War.

Since the emergence of post-Soviet Russia in 1991, [the Kremlin's
preoccupation with the insecurity of the country's **western
flank**]{.underline} has manifested itself on multiple occasions, and in
defiance of indisputable trends in European security since the end of
the Cold War. In the 1990s, [Russian leaders objected to
**NATO**]{.underline} admitting new members from Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union. Russia's president at the time, Boris Yeltsin,
accused U.S. president Bill Clinton of trying to split the continent
again.1 Russia's military threatened prospective members of the alliance
with nuclear weapons, its foreign intelligence service warned about
military retaliation in general, and its [diplomats charged that the
"**NATO-centrism**" and "**NATO-mania**" of U.S. policy "**cannot suit
Russia**."]{.underline}2 [All of these]{.underline} accusations [became
the **major, persistent theme** in Russian policy toward Europe,
culminating in the demands to fundamentally **revise European security
arrangements** presented to the United States and NATO]{.underline} in
December 2021 [as the prelude to the war against Ukraine]{.underline}.3

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Russia's objections to NATO's
eastward expansion made little sense to an outside observer as the
country's struggles and biggest challenges were domestic during that
period---the bloody campaign to suppress the separatist guerilla
movement in Chechnya, the instability in the wider North Caucasus
region, the sputtering efforts to revive the economy, and the political
chaos. The United States and its NATO allies had nothing to do with any
of these, and they provided financial and technical assistance to the
Russian government on a wide range of economic and societal reforms.

Moreover, in the aftermath of the Soviet Union's breakup, the United
States and its allies spent vast amounts of money on programs that were
essential to Russian national security. They financed and in many other
ways facilitated the removal to Russia and securing of the vast nuclear
arsenal and other weapons of mass destruction scattered across several
former Soviet republics. Although this Cooperative Threat Reduction
program was one of the key U.S. national security priorities, its
immediate beneficiary was Russia.4

As NATO's eastward expansion got underway, the United States, eager to
collect the post--Cold War "peace dividend," drastically reduced its
military presence in Europe.5 At the end of the Cold War, it had some
300,000 troops in the continent. By 1995, that number had decreased to
just over 100,000, where it remained approximately for the next decade.
By 2008, it dropped to about 65,000, where it has been ever since. By
2013---the last year before the annexation of Crimea by Russia---the
United States had reduced the number of its tanks deployed in the
European theater from 5,000 in 1989 to zero.6 Other NATO members had
carried out equally drastic changes to reduce their defense spending and
the size of their militaries.7

Thus, NATO's expansion was accompanied by a process of its
demilitarization. In speeches by its leaders and in official statements,
the alliance embraced as its purpose securing "a lasting peace in
Europe, based on common values of individual liberty, democracy, human
rights and the rule of law."8 That purpose at times seemed to overshadow
its original mission of common defense, which was expected---or almost
presumed---to become obsolete as common values would become the
foundation of European security. In two strategic concepts---in 1999 and
2010---NATO also declared achieving "partnership" with Russia as a
goal.9 In some documents it already referred to its relationship with
Russia as a "partnership."10

Senior U.S. [officials]{.underline} in speeches and testimonies
throughout the pivotal 1990s [stated that expansion would **not involve
greater deployments**]{.underline} of U.S. troops to the territories of
new members but would instead result in an overall reduction of the U.S.
military presence on the continent, which would be transformed into an
"area where wars simply do not happen."11 The alliance also pledged to
Russia that it had

> no intention, no plan and no reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the
> territory of new members, nor any need to change any aspect of NATO's
> nuclear posture or nuclear policy -- and do not foresee any future
> need to do so.12

And, given their small size and military capabilities, none of the new
members could pose individually or collectively a meaningful threat to
Russia.

In addition to its three pillars of propagation of shared democratic
values, reduction of NATO's military forces, and eastward expansion, the
revamped European security architecture was buttressed by two key
treaties intended to enhance the stability and security of all European
nations. The first was the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF)
Treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1987, which
eliminated an entire class of weapons that Soviet leaders had found
threatening to their heartland and destabilizing for international
security.13 The other was the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE)
Treaty in 1990, which imposed limits on and regulated military
deployments by all its signatories.14 In addition, Vienna Document 99
provided for increased transparency of military activities to build
mutual confidence and reduce the risk of inadvertent and accidental
escalation.

In addition to these treaties and documents governing primarily European
security matters, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
Russia signed several **arms-control treaties**]{.underline} [that
greatly reduced the numbers of strategic **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline} and means of their delivery in their arsenals.
The 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ([START
I]{.underline})[,]{.underline} the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions
Treaty ([SORT]{.underline}), [and New START]{.underline} in 2010 were
major contributions to both countries' security.

When measured by such indicators as the presence of powerful hostile
neighbors, the military footprint as well as the declarations and
actions of its presumed principal adversary in the European theater, and
the framework of legally binding treaties, Russia entered the
twenty-first century with the security of its western flank assured as
never before. That, however, was not enough for it.

IT IS OFFICIAL

These positive changes in European security were noted in a succession
of Russian national security documents of the 1990s and the 2000s.
However, these [documents also expressed a clear **unease**
about]{.underline} the eastward expansion of [NATO.]{.underline}
Beginning with the 1993 military doctrine, "the expansion of military
blocs and alliances to the detriment of the interests of the Russian
Federation's military security" was noted as a "danger" that could
become an actual threat in the event of "the introduction of foreign
troops in the territory of neighboring states of the Russian
Federation."15 [The expansion of NATO became a key theme in subsequent
iterations of **military doctrine** and **national security
strategy**]{.underline}, with growing apprehension [that "military
dangers to the Russian Federation]{.underline} \[[were]{.underline}\]
[**intensifying**," chief among them the "**military infrastructure of
NATO member countries**]{.underline}" approaching Russia's borders.16

[The most notable]{.underline} official pronouncement in this regard
[was Putin's speech at the]{.underline} 2007 [Munich Security Conference
in which he issued a stern warning to the United States and its allies
not to expand NATO further eastward]{.underline}.17 [The Kremlin
**followed up on Putin's warning**]{.underline} by crushing the Georgian
military in the brief 2008 war to make clear that it would not tolerate
Tbilisi's ambitions to join NATO.

[The war was followed by the **resumption of cooperative
relations**]{.underline} with the West.18 But [the détente]{.underline}
with the West during Dmitry Medvedev's presidency [did **not diminish
Russian opposition to NATO's eastward expansion** as a threat to its
security interests]{.underline}.19

[Russia's balancing act between **cooperation** and competition with
NATO ended following]{.underline} its 2014 annexation of [Crimea and the
start of its undeclared war in eastern Ukraine. NATO was **officially**
and **unequivocally declared** the principal source of military
danger]{.underline} to the country.20 Russia's most recent National
Security Strategy, published in July 2021, describes the United States
and NATO as developing options for nuclear and conventional strikes
against the country.21

[The war against Ukraine]{.underline}, launched by the Kremlin in
response to the West's refusal to accept its demands to fundamentally
revise the post--Cold War security arrangements, [has put an end to the
few remaining hopes of managing the tense relationship
through]{.underline} such channels as [the NATO--Russia
Council]{.underline}, the Normandy Format to resolve the stalemate in
eastern Ukraine, and the U.S.-Russia Strategic Stability Dialogue.22 The
post--Cold War chapter in relations has ended with a major war between
Russia and Ukraine backed by NATO in effect with all measures just short
of direct participation by alliance troops. [The ongoing conflict
underscores the primacy of the European theater for Russia and the
**role of the United States and NATO as the pacing
challenge**]{.underline} for its defense and national security policy.

CHINA MISSING

[By contrast, China is **virtually absent**]{.underline} from the
Russian official statements, national security documents, and narratives
spanning the three post--Cold War decades. The most recent National
Security Strategy contains two references to the country: one in the
context of "developing a relationship of all-encompassing partnership
and strategic cooperation," and the other in the context of deepening
cooperation with it in the context of the BRICS
(Brazil-India-China-South Africa) counterpart to the U.S.-led G7 group
of advanced democracies.23 Earlier iterations similarly referred to
China as a partner with whom Russia planned to sustain and expand
cooperative relations.24

[**Partnership with China** has been the **counterweight to Russia's
increasingly adversarial relations with the United States and NATO**.
The two have progressed in synch over]{.underline} the course of
[Putin's leadership, and the war against Ukraine is the **most recent
manifestation** of this dynamic]{.underline}. Just before the war,
[Putin and]{.underline} Chinese President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping
[jointly announced the "no limits" friendship and declared that there
were "no 'forbidden' areas for cooperat]{.underline}ion" between their
two countries. [These statements confirmed that **balancing against the
West** by aligning **ever closer with China**]{.underline} [is at the
**heart of Russian policy**]{.underline}.25

[From Russia's perspective, the partnership with China rests on solid
reasoning]{.underline}. This includes political complementarity between
two authoritarian governments and economic complementarity between
China's manufacturing sector and Russia's resource wealth. For Russia's
ruling elite, the relationship is particularly important for two
reasons. First, unlike the United States and the European Union, [China
does **not seek to impose its values** or **demand domestic political
changes** that would loosen its hold on power in exchange for
partnership]{.underline}. Beijing would also probably look unfavorably
at attempts by Moscow to liberalize domestic politics. Second, Russia's
ruling elite derives significant material benefits from controlling the
commanding heights of the economy. It has little incentive to change the
resource sector's dominant role in the economy, which benefits from
trade with China.

Beyond these ideological, political, and economic factors, Russia [has
sound **strategic reasons**]{.underline} for pursuing and strengthening
its partnership with China. Their priorities complement rather than
contradict each other. Since [Russia's primary theater is
**Europe**]{.underline} and [China's is the **Asia-Pacific**, their
strategic interests overlap only in Central Asia, a region that is of
**secondary importance**]{.underline} for both and where they can
deconflict their interests as long as no strategic competitor like the
United States is present.

[Russia and China share a **common adversary in the United States**,
which has **global capabilities** and presence that they see as
**challenging their interests in their critical theaters**. Both
consider U.S. defense programs, such as **missile defenses deployed in
Europe**]{.underline} and the Asia-Pacific or to protect the homeland,
[as a threat to their security and an attempt by the United States to
deny them the ability to deter and retaliate against it in the event of
war. Russia and China also in effect function as a **force
multiplier**]{.underline} [for each other by **tying up U.S.
capabilities in their respective critical theaters** and thus
**preventing it from focusing its efforts on one or the
other.**]{.underline}

AVOIDING A TWO-THEATER CONFRONTATION

[For Russia, which during most of the Cold War faced a major
confrontation in two]{.underline} strategic
[theaters]{.underline}---with the United States and NATO in Europe and
with China in Asia---[the repeat of that experience]{.underline}, which
ultimately led to the collapse of the Soviet economy and the breakup of
the Soviet Union, [is **not an option**. The Kremlin sees the West as
**by far the most serious threat**, which must be
**prioritized**]{.underline} while [disagreements with China have to be
**managed**]{.underline} and **[resolved through
diplomacy]{.underline}**.

A great deal has been written about the successful diplomatic maneuver
that was the opening of U.S. relations with China during former
president Richard Nixon's administration. For the Soviet Union, already
facing a hostile China in its Far East since the early 1960s as a result
of the Sino-Soviet split, the prospect of an alignment between
Washington and Beijing translated into a major military and economic
burden. At the height of the Cold War, it had to maintain as many as
fifty divisions facing China along a border of 4,200 kilometers.26 That
was in addition to the sixty-five divisions in the western Soviet Union,
twenty on its southern flank, and thirty in Eastern Europe.27 If the
West's victory in the Cold War is attributed to the inability of the
Soviet economy to sustain the burden of competition with the United
States and its allies, significant credit is owed to China as a force
multiplier in that competition.

[The imperative to avoid a two-theater confrontation with powerful
adversaries is]{.underline} also [a lesson of the Soviet experience
during the Second World War]{.underline}. After the experience of tense
relations in the 1930s, which culminated in a major battle in 1939 in
Mongolia, the Soviet Union signed a neutrality pact with Japan in
1941.28 Combined with intelligence that Japan would not launch an attack
against its Far East, this secured the Soviet Union's strategic rear.29
No longer threatened with a two-front war in Europe and in Asia, Moscow
was able to concentrate its effort on the war with Germany. This is a
lesson well remembered in Russia today.30

The only major military campaign carried out by the Soviet army in the
Pacific took place after the defeat of Germany. Launched against Japan
in August 1945, when the outcome of the war in the Pacific was not in
doubt, this lasted just a few weeks and was concluded in early
September. Known as the Manchurian campaign, it resulted in the defeat
of the Japanese Kwantung Army.31

In Soviet and [Russian military literature]{.underline}, which [relies
heavily on **historical experience**]{.underline} to inform future
concepts of operations[, the Manchurian campaign has long been held up
as a **successful example** of **rapid offensive
operations**]{.underline} designed to bring about a quick defeat of the
enemy as early as in the initial phase of the war.32 In preparation for
it, in early 1945, [the Soviet High Command undertook **major troop
redeployments**]{.underline} to the Far East from Europe, where the
outcome of the war with Germany was already certain. In April 1945, the
Soviet Union renounced its nonaggression treaty with Japan.33 It issued
a declaration of war on August 8 and the following day launched its
offensive---three days after the United States dropped the first atomic
bomb on Hiroshima. The operation was concluded on September 2, when
Japan surrendered. During the Cold War and the long period of tension
with China, the Manchurian campaign was seen as the prototype for
potential future operations against it.34

However, more recent Russian historiography reflects a different
understanding of the Manchurian campaign. Instead of offering lessons
for the conduct of hypothetical future operations against China, it is
used to correct what Russia sees as the false historical narrative
propagated in the West that the campaign was of marginal impact on the
defeat of Japan in the Second World War. On the occasion of the
seventieth anniversary of the campaign in 2015, the dean of Russian
military scientists, Army General Mahmut Gareev, who as a young officer
fought in the Second World War and participated in the campaign,
published an article challenging the proposition that the U.S. atomic
bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki had played the decisive role in
the defeat of Japan, arguing instead that the Manchurian campaign was of
the "greatest military-political significance."35 The campaign, he
stated, had precipitated the capitulation of Japan.

Instead of the anti-China bias evident in Russian Cold War writings,
more recent ones reflect a clear anti-Japan bias and emphasize the
Japanese threat to the Soviet Union and China during the Second World
War. Also on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the
Manchurian campaign, the official Russian government newspaper
Rossiyskaya Gazeta charged that "Japanese aggression had for many years
posed a serious threat to the vital interests of the Soviet and Chinese
peoples, \[and\] millions of Chinese were enslaved by treacherous
occupiers."36 Gareev wrote in his article that the defeat of the
Japanese army in Manchuria "washed away the shame of \[Russia's\]
defeat" in the Russo-Japanese war of 1905, which had weighed as "a heavy
memory in the conscience of our country."

The shift in Russian official historiography from the Cold War
preoccupation with China to the post--Cold War focus on Japan is
consistent with changes in security policy. Russia's ever-closer
partnership with China has relegated the prospect of a military
confrontation between them to the margins, whereas the deteriorating
relationship with the United States has elevated the perception of
threat from its treaty ally Japan.

Japan is also the only country---other than Ukraine, after the illegal
annexation of Crimea by Russia---that maintains active territorial
claims against Russia. The Russian military doctrine published in 2003
highlights the threat of maritime landing operations in the Far East.37
The potential culprit in such contingencies could only be Japan,
possibly in coalition with the United States. The document also notes
that inadequate transport links between central Russia and the Far East
could have a "negative impact" on the course of military operations.38
The combination of Japanese territorial claims and inferior Russian
capabilities in this theater could in the event of a conflict leave
Russia with few alternatives to resorting to nuclear strikes against the
invaders.

Japan hosts U.S. troops on its territory and participates in joint
military activities with the United States in the Asia-Pacific. Although
it has canceled two previously planned sites for the U.S. Aegis Ashore
missile system, it has decided to procure two Aegis-equipped ships and
thus to contribute to what Russian officials perceive as the U.S.-led
effort to build global missile defenses, which they consider to be a
threat to Russia.39 Russian analysts have also criticized Japan's
changes in its defense posture that entail, in their view, growing
geographic ambitions, capabilities beyond self-defense, and
participation in presumably U.S.-led coalition wars.40

Overall, however, [the Far East and the Asia-Pacific do **not hold a
special place as an independent theater of operations in Russian
official military thinking**]{.underline}. Rather, [its importance
reflects threat perceptions driven by adversarial relations with the
United States and its NATO allies centered on Europe and the imperative
of avoiding a **simultaneous confrontation in two far-flung
theaters**]{.underline}.

#### It's impossible to defend against [both]{.underline}. China's the [larger threat]{.underline}, but Russia will [punish the US]{.underline} if the relationship doesn't stabilize.

ASIA FIRST

[Biden's **initial theory**]{.underline} of foreign policy [was
**straightforward**: don't let **smaller challenges** distract from the
**big one**]{.underline}. Of all the threats Washington faces, Biden's
interim national security strategy argued, [China "is the **only
competitor**" able to "mount a sustained challenge]{.underline} to a
stable and open international system." [That challenge has become
**greater**]{.underline} as [China has accelerated its efforts to
**overturn the balance of power in Asia**]{.underline}. When Biden took
office, U.S. military leaders publicly warned that [Beijing could
**invade Taiwan** by 2027]{.underline}. Biden was not naive enough to
think that other problems would simply vanish. With trouble brewing on
this central front, however, he did seek a measure of calm on others.

Biden avoided another doomed "reset" with Russia, but held an early
summit with Putin in a bid to establish a "stable and predictable"
relationship. He also sought to find a path back to the 2015 nuclear
deal with Iran, thereby reducing the growing risk of confrontation in
the Middle East. Finally, Biden ended the U.S. war in Afghanistan, a
decision he justified by arguing that it was time to refocus attention
and resources on the Indo-Pacific. Relations with U.S. allies followed
the same pattern: the administration dropped U.S. opposition to the Nord
Stream 2 gas pipeline linking Russia and western Europe, wagering that
ending a contentious dispute with Germany would make it easier to win
Berlin's cooperation vis-à-vis Beijing.

Biden's emerging defense strategy has a similar thrust. The
[Trump]{.underline} administration [made a]{.underline} major [shift in
U.S. defense planning, arguing]{.underline} that [the Pentagon must
relentlessly prepare for a conflict against a great-power
challenge]{.underline}---particularly [from
**China**]{.underline}---even though that meant accepting greater risk
in other regions. [Biden's Pentagon likewise spent 2021 focusing
on]{.underline} how to deter or defeat [Chinese aggression,
withdrawing]{.underline} scarce [assets such as **missile defense
batteries**]{.underline} from the Middle East, [and making]{.underline}
**[longer-term budgetary investments]{.underline}** meant
[to]{.underline} "[prioritize China]{.underline} and its military
modernization as our pacing challenge."

TROUBLE EVERYWHERE

[Biden is **undoubtedly right**]{.underline} that [the Chinese challenge
overshadows **all others**]{.underline}, despite unresolved debates in
Washington over exactly when that challenge will become most severe.
[His administration has made **major moves**]{.underline} in the
Sino-American competition during its first year---[expanding
**multilateral military planning**]{.underline} and exercises in the
western Pacific, focusing bodies such as NATO and the G-7 on Beijing's
belligerence, and launching the AUKUS partnership with Australia and the
United Kingdom. [Yet Biden hasn't enjoyed anything resembling a respite
on **other fronts**]{.underline}.

The U.S. [withdrawal from Afghanistan]{.underline} precipitated the
collapse of the government there, [generating a near-term
crisis]{.underline} that consumed Washington's attention and [leaving
longer-term legacies]{.underline}---strategic and humanitarian---that
are likely to do the same. Meanwhile, a brutal internal conflict in
Ethiopia destabilized [one of Africa's most important
countries]{.underline}. Most problematic of all, U.S. relations with
[**Iran** and **Russia** became **worse**]{.underline}, not better.

[The United States is an **overstretched hegemon**, with a defense
**strategy out of balance** with the foreign policy it
supports]{.underline}.

**[Iran]{.underline}** [has taken a **hard-line stance**]{.underline} in
negotiations [on a **revived nuclear deal**]{.underline} while steadily
[decreasing the amount of time it would need to produce a **potential
weapon**.]{.underline} Tehran's [proxies]{.underline} have also
conducted periodic [attacks against U.S. personnel and partners in the
Middle East]{.underline} as part of an ongoing effort to force an
American withdrawal from the region.

[Putin]{.underline}, for his part, [has authorized]{.underline} or at
least permitted significant **[cyberattacks]{.underline}** [against
critical infrastructure in the United States.]{.underline} He threatened
[war against **Ukraine**]{.underline} in the spring and has now
mobilized forces [for]{.underline} what U.S. officials fear could be a
**[major invasion]{.underline}** and prolonged occupation of that
country. To preserve the peace, Moscow has demanded an acknowledged
Russian sphere of influence and the rollback of NATO's military presence
in eastern Europe. What exactly Putin has in mind for Ukraine is
uncertain, but ["**stable and predictable**" is]{.underline} clearly
[not how he envisions his relationship]{.underline} with the United
States.

These are ominous signs for 2022. The [United States could find itself
facing **grave security crises**]{.underline} in Europe and the Middle
East **[in addition to]{.underline}** persistent and [elevated tensions
in the Pacific]{.underline}. And [these possibilities hint at a deeper
problem]{.underline} in U.S. statecraft, one that has been accumulating
for years[: **strategic overstretch**]{.underline}.

MORE WITH LESS

Facing trouble on many fronts is business as usual for a global power.
U.S. foreign policy---and the defense strategy that buttresses it---has
long been designed with that problem in mind. After the Cold War, the
United States adopted a "two major regional contingencies" approach to
defense planning. In essence, it committed to maintaining a military
large and capable enough to fight two serious wars in separate regions
at roughly the same time. U.S. planners were under no illusion that
Washington could fully indemnify itself against all the threats it faced
if they happened to manifest simultaneously. Their aim was to limit the
risk inherent in a global foreign policy by ensuring that an enemy in
one theater could not wage a successful war of aggression while the
Pentagon was busy with a crisis in another. Just as the United Kingdom,
the superpower of its day, had a two-power naval standard in the
nineteenth century, a unipolar United States had a two-war standard for
a generation after 1991.

Over time, however, [the two-war standard became **impossible to
sustain**.]{.underline} The [defense spending cuts]{.underline}
associated with the Budget Control Act of 2011 (later compounded by the
sequestration cuts of 2013) [forced the Pentagon to adopt a]{.underline}
somewhat stingier **["one-plus" war standard]{.underline}** aimed at
defeating one capable aggressor and stalemating or "imposing
unacceptable costs" on another. Meanwhile, the [number of threats was
**increasing**]{.underline}. During the post-Cold War era, the Pentagon
worried mostly about potential conflicts in the Persian Gulf and the
Korean Peninsula. But the events of 2014 and 2015---the
[I]{.underline}slamic [S]{.underline}tate's rampage through Iraq and
Syria, [Russian aggression in Ukraine, and China's drive for dominance
in the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, [along
with]{.underline} ongoing operations in
[Afghanistan]{.underline}---[showed that U.S. allies and interests were
now **imperiled** in **several regions at once**.]{.underline}

[Leaders in **Moscow** and **Tehran** see]{.underline} that [the United
States is **stretched thin** and **eager to pay more attention to
China**]{.underline}.

[Washington's enemies were also **growing more formidable**. The two-war
standard was]{.underline} primarily [focused on **rogue
states**]{.underline} with second-class militaries. [Now, the United
States had to contend with two near-peer competitors, China and Russia,
that boasted **world-class conventional capabilities** alongside the
advantages that would come from fighting on their own **geopolitical
doorsteps**.]{.underline} By the end of Barack Obama's presidency, it
was an open question whether the United States could defeat China if
Beijing assaulted Taiwan, or Russia if Moscow invaded the Baltic region.
What was clear was that [any]{.underline} such [war would require the
**overwhelming majority of the Pentagon's combat power**]{.underline},
along with virtually all of its airlift and sealift capabilities.

This realization prompted a major change in U.S. defense planning. The
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration's defense strategy [declared that
the two-war standard was **history**]{.underline}. The U.S. military
would henceforth be sized and shaped to win one major war against a
great-power competitor. The United States would still be capable of
"deterring" aggression in other theaters, but, as a bipartisan
commission that included several current Biden administration officials
pointed out, how exactly the Pentagon would do so without the capability
to defeat such aggression remained ambiguous.

[Shifting]{.underline} to a one-war standard was a sensible way to
motivate the lethargic Pentagon bureaucracy to find creative solutions
to the urgent, daunting challenge of war with a near-peer rival. It
[involved a **sober recognition**]{.underline} [that losing a
great-power war could inflict a **death blow** on the **U.S.-led
international order**]{.underline}. Yet the 2018 defense strategy was
also an acknowledgment of overstretch: the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [could focus on its primary challenge **only by
reducing its ability to focus on others**]{.underline}. This limitation
is the root of the problem Biden has inherited, and it has some
dangerous implications.

THE CREDIBILITY GAP

[The **most glaring danger**]{.underline}, highlighted by the concurrent
crises in eastern Europe and East Asia, [is that the United States could
have to fight wars against **China and Russia simultaneously**. This
would indeed be a **nightmare scenario**]{.underline} for a one-war
military. But [it wouldn't take a **global security meltdown** to reveal
the problems caused by Washington's predicament]{.underline}.

First, [overstretch limits]{.underline} U.S. [options in a crisis. Where
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should draw the line
against Russian aggression in eastern Europe]{.underline}, how hard it
should push back [against Tehran's provocations in the Middle East, and
whether it should use force to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear
threshold state]{.underline} are matters that reasonable people can
debate. **[But]{.underline}** the fact that [the United States
increasingly has a **China centric defense strategy** has a
**constraining effect in other theaters**. If a U.S. president
knows]{.underline} that [the Pentagon will need everything it has for an
**all-too-plausible war with China**, he or she will be **less inclined
to use force against Iran or Russia**]{.underline}, lest Washington be
caught short if violence erupts in the Pacific.

This issue leads to a second problem: the loss of diplomatic influence
in situations short of war. [Since]{.underline} the [**Taiwan** and
**Ukraine** crises]{.underline} of early 2021, some
[observers]{.underline} have [speculated that **Putin** and]{.underline}
Chinese President **[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping [are
coordinating]{.underline} their [**coercion** as a way of threatening
Washington with a **two-front war**]{.underline}. The reality is that
[explicit coordination is **hardly necessary** to profit from U.S.
overextension]{.underline}.

Historically, [overstretched superpowers have eventually faced hard
choices]{.underline}.

Leaders in Moscow and Tehran can see that the United States is stretched
thin militarily and eager to pay more attention to China. This gives
them an incentive to push Washington harder in hopes of achieving gains
at the expense of a distracted superpower. As the Russia expert Michael
Kofman has written, Putin's strategy of using military coercion to
revise the post-Cold War order in Europe is premised on his belief that
the "greater threat from China" will eventually "force Washington to
compromise and renegotiate." The more intense its focus on China, the
higher the price the United States may be willing to pay for restraint
in other places.

[The perils of overstretch]{.underline}, however, [are not confined to
**secondary theaters**. Weakness at the periphery can ultimately cause
**weakness at the center**]{.underline}. A decade ago, the United States
withdrew its forces from Iraq to economize in the Middle East and pivot
toward the Pacific. Iraq's subsequent collapse forced Washington to
reengage there, fighting a multi-year conflict that devoured resources
and attention.

Similarly, [if the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [finds
itself in a showdown with Iran or if Russia attempts to revise the
status quo]{.underline} in eastern Europe, [Washington may once again
find itself **pivoting away from the Pacific** to reinforce
**under-resourced regions**]{.underline} that still matter to U.S.
security. [America's defense strategy is **increasingly focused on the
Indo-Pacific**, but its foreign policy remains **stubbornly
global**]{.underline}. That's a recipe for trouble all around.

TOUGH CHOICES

To be clear, [military power]{.underline} is hardly the only thing that
matters in global affairs. But it [is a necessary component of an
effective foreign policy]{.underline}, if only because force remains the
ultimate arbiter of international disputes. Xi, Putin, and other U.S.
adversaries are unlikely to be swayed by Biden's "relentless diplomacy"
unless they are also awed by the military power that backs it up.

[**Historically**, overstretched superpowers have eventually faced hard
choices about **how to address mismatches**]{.underline} between
commitments and capabilities. When the United Kingdom found itself with
more rivals than it could handle in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, it began appeasing those that were less dangerous
and proximate---including the United States---to concentrate on
containing Germany. When the Korean War revealed that Washington's
containment policy outstripped its military resources, the United States
was forced to undertake a significant defense buildup to close the gap.

The [Biden]{.underline} administration [may]{.underline} try to **[skirt
this dilemma]{.underline}** by [managing tensions with Iran, Russia, and
other challengers while **encouraging allies in Europe** and partners in
the Middle East to take greater responsibility for their own
defense]{.underline}. That's an understandable instinct. In the near
term, [both the geopolitical costs of true retrenchment and the
financial costs of rearmament may seem to exceed the difficulties of
muddling along. Yet]{.underline} Biden's first year has already shown
that [overstretch **inflicts damage on the installment
plan**.]{.underline} Eventually, [the world will punish a superpower
that allows its strategic deficit to grow **too big for too
long**.]{.underline}

#### Overstretch cedes [competition with China]{.underline}, making hotspots [escalate]{.underline}. 

Nishtha **Kaushiki 21**, Assistant Prof of International Studies at the
Central University of Punjab, 12-10-21, \"China: A nemesis that NATO

The mention of China as a potential challenger to NATO first emerged in
one of its documents in 2019, and by 2020-21, it has become its
\"systemic rival\". From a Euro-Atlantic perspective, Russia is a direct
military threat that does not shy away from a head-on clash. Its primary
focus is on its immediate strategic backyard- Eastern Europe and Central
Asia. On the other hand, [China has **violent tendencies towards its
neighbours** and politically intimidates the countries of other regions
by actively using its economic and political clout]{.underline}.
Further, [it has forged strategic **partnerships with authoritarian
countries**, attempts to change the existing security architectures by
challenging the freedom of navigation of commercial ships by buying or
financing strategic assets worldwide]{.underline}. Thus, [it has a
global strategic agenda and is **far more dangerous than Russia
for**]{.underline} the EU and **[NATO]{.underline}**.

There has been an upward trend of trade between the EU and China. During
the first nine months of 2020, the bilateral trade between the two was
Euro 425.5 billion. Simultaneously, the EU-US trade saw a downward trend
of -11.4 percent for imports and -10 percent for exports. With regard to
the Chinese BRI, in 2018, China marked its strategic presence in
North-Western Europe with the takeover of Zeebrugge terminal in Belgium
and Greece\'s Piraeus seaport,followed by crucial infrastructural
development projects in Spain, Italy and Greece. Germany\'s Duisburg
inland port should not be missed either. The EU and NATO essentially see
the 17+1 format as a leapfrog approach by Beijing that threatens the
region\'s security.

In 2019, two significant developments took place. First, at the EU-China
summit in April 2019, a few states opposed a standard EU stand against
China, given its strategic influence. Second, Italy was the first G7
country to join the BRI. Thus, the cracks in the solidarity of the EU
began to appear. In the investments sector, the regulatory preferences
for the 5G rollout have been chiefly guided by the US. The EU security
concerns have vetted the domestic legal guidelines of individual states,
and hence, all efforts have been made to sideline Huawei, which is
primarily seen as a \"Trojan Horse\". As China aims to become a world
leader in Artificial Intelligence by 2030, the penetration of Huawei and
other such critical technologies such as biotechnology and robotics, the
propaganda warfare through disinformation campaigns challenges both
Europe and the US. The additional challenge \'democratic backsliding\'
due to the Chinese influence over the fragile partners of the EU and the
\'potential members\' can also not be missed. In light of this, the 2021
summit communiqué acknowledged the evolving nature of warfare involving
the malicious use of AI apart from simultaneous attacks with hypersonic
missiles. The threat has thus become three-fold \-- a fully modernised
conventional attack with the potential of a supplemented nuclear attack
apart from the emerging contours of hybrid warfare and the questions of
the continuance of supply chains. In a nutshell, the Chinese policies of
geostrategic and geo-economic penetration apart from its Military-Civil
Fusion (MCF) strategy constitute the core of its \"systemic challenge\".

During the Cold War, it was asserted that the security of Western Europe
depended upon the containment of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, with
the \'unipolar moment\' gradually coming to an end with the US
overstretch with wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the incorporation of
Russia in the Atlantic partnership would probably have allowed NATO to
geographically and politically cross the barriers of Eurasia.
Consequently, today from \"spoiler states\", Russia and China have
rapidly transformed themselves into \"revisionist states\", and the role
of China is a much profound one. With Joint exercises of both the
countries in the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea and Beijing\'s recent
outreach to Equatorial Guinea to establish its first permanent military
mission in the Atlantic, the Euro Atlantic insecurities will increase
all the more.

[Had the Sino-Russo strategic convergences been **nipped**]{.underline}
in the bud itself [by strategic re-evaluation]{.underline} and the
inclusion [of **Russia in NATO**]{.underline}, the story of
[geopolitics]{.underline} perhaps [could have been **fundamentally
different**]{.underline}, both for the EU and as for South Asia.
[Acceptance of Russia as an \"equal\" would have probably done away with
the heartburns that Moscow]{.underline} has right now. [The inability to
accept that **hybrid warfare**]{.underline} (4th and 5th generation)
[would necessitate **politically expanding the horizons of deterrence**
against]{.underline} a new rising power ([China]{.underline}) [has done
**more harm than good** to NATO]{.underline}. The visionary approach of
[including Russia in NATO was discouraged when Russia\'s
request]{.underline} to join the organisation [was **turned down by the
U.S.**]{.underline} not once but thrice, [leading to the creation of
**new political faultlines**. It also led to strengthening the
**Sino-Russo alliance** apart from leaving a **geopolitical vacuum** in
which China and Russia could attempt to downplay the EU and
NATO]{.underline}. Today, the takeover or annexation of the Crimea, the
[Ukrainian crisis, the refugee dispute between Poland and Belarus, and
the inclusion of the EU]{.underline} countries [in]{.underline} the
[BRI]{.underline} Corridor [have become the **larger geopolitical
testers**]{.underline} of a \'United\' EU and NATO, apart from the US
sphere of influence.

[There is still a lack of political cohesion on]{.underline} the
[methodologies to tackle China]{.underline} in this direction. While the
US and Britain have decided to boycott Beijing 2022 Olympic and
Paralympic Winter Games, [the EU]{.underline}, on the other hand, [has
refrained from taking a collective stand]{.underline} on the issue.
Given the increasingly intertwined stakes that the Union has with China,
it is hesitant to take a joint stand fearing its retaliatory \"economic
coercion\". France\'s position is contrary to the US, which is well
grasped in the backdrop of the formation of the AUKUS and the severed
deal between Canberra and Paris. Such emerging diverging approaches
within the EU that China would possibly try to use in its favour to
increase its strategic foothold, thereby weakening the Atlantic
alliance.

Early this year, G7 partners announced the \'Build Back Better World
Initiative\' (B3W), followed by the \'Global Gateway\' initiative that
aims to mobilise Euro 300 billion between 2021 and 2027. As one can see,
the developments are similar to the \'Greek-Turkish Aid Bill\' --- the
US initial response to contain Communist expansion. However, in the
contemporary scenario, [additions such as hybrid warfare, hostile
economic takeovers, and dual-use ports have ushered in **new dimensions
of geopolitics**]{.underline}. A full-blown \'New Cold War\' is in
place.

[China and Russia would]{.underline} probably [seek to **militarily
distract** the EU and the US with]{.underline} small but
[essentia]{.underline}l **[\'hotspots\']{.underline}** [such as
**Taiwan** and **Ukraine**. The risks of **escalation** and
**misjudgement** have increased the chances of **open
hostilities**]{.underline} all the more, [but, given the constraints of
**economic dependencies**]{.underline}, especially the questions of the
continuance of supply chain routes, [one can be **still doubtful of the
NATO response**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [territorial **nibbling**
would also **not be taken lightly**]{.underline} by NATO. [The vicious
circle thus seems to continue with more of **trade wars**,
**sanctions**, and **hostile takeovers**]{.underline}, thereby [creating
sharp polarisations **throughout the globe**]{.underline} [and regional
and other organisations such as]{.underline} the EU and

POST--COLD WAR U.S.-RUSSIAN RELATIONS---WHAT WENT WRONG?

U.S. policy toward Russia since the end of the Cold War is a story of
different administrations pursuing essentially the same set of policies.
[Two aspects stand out as **major irritants**]{.underline} in the
bilateral relationship[: a refusal to accept Russia **as it
is,**]{.underline} as evidenced by repeated initiatives to reform and
remake its political system[; and the **extension of the Euro-Atlantic
security architecture** into the Eurasian space surrounding Russia. Both
of these highly ambitious pursuits have been attempted **repeatedly and
unsuccessfully**, yet both continue to be **cornerstones of official
U.S. policy toward Russia**]{.underline}. In retrospect, it is hard to
escape the conclusion that [a less ambitious U.S. approach to dealing
with Russia]{.underline} and the states of the former Soviet Union
[could have established a **better basis** for a less rocky U.S.-Russian
relationship.]{.underline}

BOOM TO BUST

Addressing a joint session of Congress in January 1991, then president
George H. W. Bush spoke about his desire "to continue to build a lasting
basis" for cooperation with Russia.6 His wish, no doubt sincere, was
expressed at a time of widely held hopes that the Cold War was ending
and the two superpowers would put their differences aside and begin
collaborating on the world's many problems "for a more peaceful future
for all mankind."7

It was indeed a promising phase in relations between Washington and
Moscow, full of significant accomplishments and optimism about the
future. In a short period of time, the two Cold War adversaries
negotiated a treaty to reduce strategic nuclear weapons (START II),
signed a multilateral treaty on conventional forces in Europe,
negotiated the terms for German reunification and a unified Germany's
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and agreed
on a charter for European security and stability after the Cold War.
Moreover, their cooperation was not confined to Europe; they also
jointly sponsored a major conference in Madrid on the Middle East and
successfully dealt with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's aggression against
Kuwait. Most important, they entered into all of these endeavors with a
new spirit of U.S.-Russian partnership, a far cry from the threatening
rhetoric and tensions that had been a hallmark of their relationship for
more than a generation.

For the three decades that followed, the U.S.-Russian relationship went
through a series of boom-bust cycles, reaching its nadir after the
Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and interference in the 2016 U.S.
presidential election. Through the Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and
Barack Obama administrations, U.S. policy toward Russia followed a
familiar pattern. First, a new presidential administration comes into
the White House deeply dissatisfied with the state of the U.S.-Russia
relationship. It commits to do better and launches a policy review that
generates a new approach---a "reset"---toward Russia aimed at developing
a partnership. The road toward partnership looks promising, but
obstacles gradually begin to emerge and eventually escalate into a
full-blown crisis. By the end of the administration's time in office,
the relationship is at the lowest point since the Cold War.

Thus, the spirit of partnership that marked the end of the Cold War did
not last long. The elder Bush's hope for a new relationship with Russia
in a new world order ran into the harsh reality of the rapid
disintegration of the Soviet Union and the chaos that engulfed Russia
less than a year after his speech. The Bush administration had little
chance to prepare for such a dramatic turn of events and develop a
policy commensurate with the magnitude of the change in Russia and
elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. Consumed by domestic economic and
political crises, Russia largely retreated from the world stage and for
the most part was rendered largely incapable of acting as a partner to
the United States as envisioned by Bush. Demoralized and embittered
Russian elites soon constructed a narrative---greatly amplified by the
Kremlin throughout Vladimir Putin's presidency---that the United States
had taken advantage of their country at a moment of weakness, which
created a sense of victimhood and soured the overall atmosphere in
U.S.-Russian relations.

The Clinton administration, frustrated with what it saw as its
predecessor's insufficiently robust engagement to support reforms in
Russia, declared its intent in 1993 to build "the foundation for a new
democratic partnership between the United States and Russia."8 Speaking
in Vancouver, Canada, in April 1993, at the first of his many summits
with Russia's then president Boris Yeltsin, Clinton promised:

> Mr. President, our nation will not stand on the sidelines when it
> comes to democracy and Russia. We know where we stand. We are with
> Russian democracy, we are with Russian reforms, we are with Russian
> markets. We support freedom of conscience and speech and religion. We
> support respect for ethnic minorities. We actively support reform and
> reformers and you in Russia.9

Soon after these hopeful words were spoken, [the relationship
encountered its first bumps]{.underline}. In late September and early
October 1993, tensions between the Russian executive and legislative
branches came to a head in a bloody confrontation in Moscow, as the
constitutional crisis between Yeltsin and his rebellious parliament led
to violence in the streets. When the dust settled, Yeltsin had managed
to push through a new constitution that consolidated executive power to
such an extent that in effect it placed the presidency above all other
branches of government. That same [autumn, Russian officials expressed
their strong **opposition to NATO enlargement**]{.underline}1[, which
was emerging as the **principal pillar of U.S. policy** in
Europe.]{.underline}0

[The new partnership between Russia and China is America\'s ***chickens
coming home to roost**.*]{.underline}

Russia and China announced the formation of a "no-limits" partnership
last week, the predictable consequence of America's misguided policy
towards post-Soviet Russia and ill-advised embrace of a rising China.

Putin and Xi publicized the agreement, spanning over 5,000 words in
English, just before the two leaders were seen at the opening ceremonies
of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, which is under diplomatic boycott by
the U.S. and other Western nations over the CCP's human-rights abuses.
"Friendship between the two States has no limits, there are no
'forbidden' areas of cooperation," the signatory nations said in a joint
statement.

In [the new bilateral pact]{.underline}, the nations [pledged mutual
support on issues that are sure to **enflame the U.S. and its
allies**]{.underline}. [Russia]{.underline} proclaimed [its support of
the **One-China principle**]{.underline}---the idea that Taiwan is an
inseparable part of China---[and]{.underline} expressed [opposition to
Taiwanese independence]{.underline}. For its part, [China joined
Russia's call to **end NATO enlargement**]{.underline}. The pair also
reiterated their [opposition to the trilateral "AUKUS"
agreement]{.underline}, which would help provide the Australians with
nuclear-powered submarines, and "[the advancement of U.S. plans to
develop global missile]{.underline} \[[defense]{.underline}\] [and
deploy its elements in various regions of the world, combined with
capacity building of high-precision non-nuclear weapons for disarming
strikes and other strategic objectives.]{.underline}"

Further, China and Russia pledged to cooperate on the development of
artificial intelligence, information security, and space technologies.
The nations also unveiled an energy deal worth \$117.5 billion that will
bolster Russia's gas exports to East Asia.

[Evolving circumstances in **Ukraine**]{.underline} [and the
S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea [provide the
**backdrop**, and **considerable incentive**, for the new
agreement]{.underline} between China and Russia. Russia has amassed over
100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine over the past few months. The
Biden administration has responded by announcing the deployment of about
3,000 additional U.S. troops to Europe, keeping another 8,500 on
standby. Aside from the AUKUS agreement, [things have grown more
complicated in the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea [due to an **increased number of Chinese incursions
into Taiwan's air defense**]{.underline} identification zone (ADIZ) and
rumors that Washington might shed its strategic ambiguity with respect
to Taiwan. [These developments are the latest in a **long line of
miscalculations** by the U.S. foreign policy apparatus over 30
years]{.underline}.

In 1949, many core European countries were still recovering from the
Second World War. The Soviet Union was, too, but its economy had
recovered more rapidly than expected and it was developing and testing
nuclear weapons. Thus, trans-Atlanticists saw a need for a defensive
alliance to stave off whatever territorial ambitions the Soviet Union
had in Western Europe. Et voilà, NATO was born. Originally, the alliance
had 12 members. Only one, Norway, shared a border with Russia. The
Soviets responded with the creation of their own alliance, the Warsaw
Pact, in 1955. By then, NATO had already added Greece, Turkey, and West
Germany.

Thirty-six years later, increased pressure from the West and
contradictions within the Soviet system resulted in the dissolution of
the USSR in 1991. The U.S. and its [NATO]{.underline} allies
[**outlasted** the Soviets and the Warsaw Pact]{.underline}. Just like
that, [NATO's raison d'être **disappeared**]{.underline}. NATO was
forced to reckon with the consequences of victory. [More than four
decades of **bureaucratic entrenchment** and **military-industrial**
expansion made the thought of ending NATO
**unpopular**]{.underline}---not to mention the fact that the United
States, unquestionably the leader of the NATO alliance, saw the alliance
as a means to cement its global hegemony.

So, instead of going out of business, [NATO went out of area, wading
into **conflicts in the Middle East**]{.underline} and [micromanaging
European instability]{.underline}. Since the fall of the USSR, [NATO has
pursued a dual track of diplomacy with Russia---simultaneously
**cooperating with Russia**]{.underline} on its chosen campaigns to
remain relevant [and maintaining the Cold War frame that Russia is the
**main menace in Europe**.]{.underline}

From 1994-1997, it appeared NATO and Russia were making real efforts to
find areas of mutual cooperation. Russia entered into NATO's Partnership
for Peace program in 1994, and three years later, the two parties signed
the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security, stating
"the reasons why NATO and Russia believe that it is in their shared
interest to cooperate more broadly and intensively."

In 1999, however, [NATO **returned to its old ways**, accepting Hungary,
Poland, and the Czech Republic]{.underline} as members of the alliance.
[The move angered the Russians]{.underline}, as NATO expansion was still
a sore point for even post-Soviet Russia. The [Russians had already felt
betrayed]{.underline} by the fact that, in subsequent negotiations
between the USSR and president George H.W. Bush's administration,
then-U.S. Secretary of State James Baker's alleged promise to the USSR
that NATO would move "not one inch" eastward never reappeared. NATO's
expansion in 1999 confirmed Russia's fears.

Nevertheless, NATO continued to court Russian cooperation. At the 2002
NATO Summit in Rome, the alliance and Russia signed another agreement to
create the NATO-Russia Council, which produced results in issue areas
such as counterterrorism.

Yet [NATO continued to **undercut its progress with
Russia**]{.underline} in other areas [by]{.underline} its **[continued
expansion]{.underline}**. In 2004, [NATO expanded for the **fifth
time**]{.underline}, adding Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and
the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), two of which share a
border with Russia. NATO then made Albania and Croatia members in 2009,
Montenegro in 2017, and North Macedonia as recently as 2020. "Not one
inch" turned into nearly 1,000 miles pretty quickly.

[Russia believes **NATO expansion won't end there**]{.underline}. Given
the precedent NATO has set, [it's **hard to blame them**]{.underline}.
In fact, NATO and some of its key member states like [the U.S. have
**openly expressed desires** to **keep expanding up to Russia's western
border**. NATO has been courting Ukraine and Georgia, **two vital
nations** in the Russian cultural imagination]{.underline}, since 1994.

While the U.S.-led [NATO]{.underline} alliance [was pursuing its
**muddled**]{.underline}, **[incoherent]{.underline}** [approach to
Russia, Russia and China started **patching up the holes**]{.underline}
in their relationship left by the Sino-Soviet split. [The two nations
solved a decades-long border dispute, increased trade in vital
industries like machine goods, textiles, energy, and other natural
resources.]{.underline} The U.S. encouraged China's rise to global
prominence by, among other things, allowing it to enter the World Trade
Organization. As one Joe Biden said in 2011, "a rising China is a
positive, positive development, not only for China but for America and
the world writ large."

Which brings us to the present moment, in which [the **trans-Atlantic
foreign policy elites**]{.underline}, bolstered by their beneficiaries
in the military-industrial complex, [refuse to offer **any prudent
course-correction to prevent the formation**]{.underline} [of a
full-fledged **axis against the United States**]{.underline}. This could
end with America's sons and daughters dying overseas to solve the
problems they created. But it doesn't have to.

Hegemony and its discontents

\"China opposes hegemonism and power politics in all their forms, does
not interfere in other countries\' internal affairs and will never seek
hegemony or engage in expansion\"

> Xi Jinping at the 18th Party Congress. 2012.

The lessons drawn from the collapse of Soviet power thus provided, and
still provides, China and Russia with a common point of historical
reference. But it was [the structure of the new international
system]{.underline} that [concerned them]{.underline} more. Both of
course recognized that with the passing of the old order the world had
changed for ever; and both would now have to sink or swim in a word
dominated by the market. There could be no going back to the past. On
the other hand, the world as seen from Beijing and Moscow was not one in
which either could feel especially comfortable. For one thing,
[the]{.underline} established [rules]{.underline} governing the world
[had all been written by the West.]{.underline} The metaphorical table
around which the main players then sat was also made and designed in the
West. And [sitting at the top]{.underline} of the table of course [was
the established hegemon: United States.]{.underline}

To add material insult to injury, in this world [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [not only possessed a vast amount of power - soft
and hard - but an **extensive alliance system**]{.underline} as well.
[**Its very existence** not only reminded China and Russia how few
genuine friends they had themselves; it also contributed in significant
ways to America\'s ability to place pressure on the two
countries]{.underline}. The US may have proclaimed its innocence,
insisting that the last thing it was thinking about when it enlarged
[**NATO** was to **encircle Russia**]{.underline}, or that when it
tilted to Asia it was looking to contain China rather than engage it.
However, that is not how things were viewed in either Moscow or Beijing.
Indeed, for the Chinese the so-called \'tilt\' (accompanied as it was by
what they saw as a change in US military doctrine)29 was seen as a
highly aggressive act; and the only legitimate response, it was felt,
was to fight fire with fire which it did with an \'outpouring\' of
increased \'anti-American sentiment\' in China itself followed up by
what looked to many as a final abandonment in practice, if not in
theory, of the tried and true Deng principle of keeping a low profile.
To underscore the point, [it also began to refer to the US less
frequently as **global partner**]{.underline} - though such language did
not disappear entirely from the Chinese foreign policy discourse31 - and
more as a potential rival which would for ever seek to maintain its
position of primacy in Asia through the manipulation of its still highly
dependent allies. This in turn connects to a wider debate in which China
and Russia have been engaged for some time about the structure of the
world system after the Cold War; and one thing has emerged from these:
[neither feels that their interests, singly or collectively, are best
protected in a system in which power is so heavily concentrated in the
hands of a single \'hegemon\']{.underline}, especially when that hegemon
happens to be a liberal power like the United States of America. This
not only flows from their very strongly held realist belief that
hegemony by definition confers great status on the hegemon. The
[concentration of power in the hands of a single power they argue is
also likely to encourage **greater assertiveness**]{.underline}. Clinton
may have resisted the temptation for a while, though not entirely as the
NATO-led bombing of Kosovo showed. But post 9/11 the situation changed
dramatically, and buoyed up by a American public fearful of yet another
attack, and [taking]{.underline} full [advantage of the]{.underline}
freedom afforded it by the much debated [unipolar \'moment\', the US
launched a war on terror with the ostensible goal of combatting global
jihad]{.underline} (of which the Chinese and Russians approved) but with
the unwritten purpose (to which they did not) of reasserting US power
after what many on the republican political right saw as a post-Cold War
decade of drift.34 The lesson drawn in China and Russia from all this
were obvious: until and when the distribution of power in the
international system had become more evenly distributed - in short had
become \'multipolar\' - then the world would not only remain a deeply
disturbed place but one in which their voice would remain marginal at
best, insignificant at worst. 35

The question is whether this justification for the continued U.S.
presence in Europe still stands, now that China is rising. Based on
predation theory, Wohlforth deduces that [the United States might want
to **bolster or strengthen Russia** to obtain its]{.underline} **[help
against China.]{.underline}**

Taliaferro is more cautious about the benefits of predation, pointing
out that [Russia's current interference in **Ukraine** and]{.underline}
its [disinformation campaign]{.underline} in Western democracies [have
their origins in]{.underline} bitter and [**long-standing resentments**
over how the Cold War ended]{.underline}. Taliaferro observes, "while
relegation in 1990 succeeded in pushing the Soviet Union out of the
great power ranks, it could never guarantee that post-Soviet Russia
would remain 'down' indefinitely." [Refusing to accept the status claims
of a declining power evokes strong emotions that can lead to an
**offensive reaction**]{.underline}. Former great powers may, over time,
recover some of their capabilities, and [an aggrieved major power may be

Brought Together by a Mutual Adversary

[China and Russia are pushed together by]{.underline} two factors. The
first is [the shared threat the **United States poses**]{.underline}.
The second is a leader-level nostalgia for the Sino-Soviet partnership.
[The most salient characteristic of]{.underline} the Sino-Russian
[alignment]{.underline} today [is their **shared threat perception** of
the United States]{.underline}. This does not mean that China and Russia
would not have any relationship absent this shared perspective --- they
always have and always will. But it does mean that [the shape and health
of their relationship would be **completely different** if the shared
threat perception of the United States **was not present**]{.underline}.

Prior to the 2014 crisis over Ukraine, China and Russia had a lukewarm
relationship. However, the crisis created a watershed event that led
Chinese government experts to designate 2014 as "a year of abnormal
acceleration of Sino-Russia relations," although, this acceleration
needs to be qualified since China has not yet recognized Russia's
annexation of Crimea. Still, around that time, [China's strategic
anxiety over the U.S. strategy of "rebalancing to Asia" **coincided with
Russia's fear over NATO's potential expansion**]{.underline}. As such,
[China made a determination that "China and Russia face the **same
international pressure**]{.underline} from the U.S. bully on a wide
range of issues from global governance to their neighborhood and to
their domestic affairs." For Beijing, China and Russia are both
identified as revisionist powers in the international order (although
the common title disguises critical distinctions of their desired
goals). Furthermore, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[constitutes the **most important threat** to both
countries]{.underline} in their primary theaters [--- China in the West
Pacific and Russia in **Eastern Europe**. Alignment]{.underline} and
cooperation [is thus sought, almost **instinctively**, to mitigate
Chinese and Russian isolation by the West, to **divide American
attention**]{.underline} and resources, [and to **complicate U.S.
military planning in both theaters**]{.underline}.

[Such an alignment is significant for **alleviating strategic pressure
on China**]{.underline}, at least psychologically. At a minimum, [it
provides a reassurance that China is not countering U.S. hegemony alone.
As long as the United States pursues "dual containment" of both China
and Russia, the alignment will have motivation and
justification]{.underline}. Given the overarching theme in the Chinese
national security strategy that defines the United States as China's
primary threat, any [disagreements with Russia are seen as
**secondary**]{.underline} and [Russian diplomatic and military
capabilities will be seen as a **valuable asset**]{.underline}.

Yet Russia's fondness for strategic maneuver, such as the utilization of
hybrid warfare, also constitutes a major risk for China. Four hundred
years of Sino-Russian relations has taught the Chinese that during
China's conflicts with others, the Russian modus operandi is to maximize
its own benefits in the name of mediation and assistance for China. For
example, Russia carved out one million square kilometers of Chinese
territory through its mediation of the Second Opium War. Therefore, the
assessment by China's Russia hands is that Moscow not only sees the "new
Cold War" between Washington and Beijing as beneficial for Russia, but
that Russia is also responsible for "exploiting and deepening the
suspicion, hostility and fear" between Washington and Beijing through
diplomatic maneuvers and manipulations. Yet, these experts also
vigorously warn about Russian acts of "balancing and coalescing" with
both America and China.

[So long as the United States remains the biggest threat to **China**
and **Russia**, the latter will **manage their differences to serve the
more important goal of countering U.S. pressure**]{.underline}. However,
while such alignment is strong in terms of words and postures, it is
weak on actions. As attested by the joint statement by China and Russia
during Putin's most recent visit of Beijing, the two countries are adept
at verbally expressing their shared positions and mutual support, but
they are short on concrete policies to be adopted. For example, as China
tries to gauge Russia's substantive support in the South China Sea and
on Taiwan, nothing but tepid statements have emerged, along with one
joint military exercise in the South China Sea in 2016. While support in
this limited domain does not do justice to China and Russia's
coordination on the global scale, the authenticity of the Sino-Russian
friendship is tested by how Russia will act toward China's most
important security concerns, such as Taiwan and the South China Sea.

[Sino-Russian alignment is]{.underline} also [vulnerable to shifts in
the **balance of relations** between the United States, China, and
Russia]{.underline}. This is the core weakness of a relationship driven
by external factors, in the eyes of Chinese analysts. As put by Ji
Zhiye, former president of CICIR, , [the]{.underline} Sino-Russian
[relationship is "temporary, uncertain, vulnerable and could be
**severely weakened**]{.underline} [by even slight changes in the
external factor]{.underline} (the U.S. policy toward both)."
[Improvement of relations with the **United States**, by]{.underline}
either China or [**Russia**, will **undermine the confidence by the
other party**.]{.underline} Furthermore, overwhelming Russian dependence
on China from sweeping Western sanctions will sow the seeds of Russian
discontent against China and result in efforts to distance and
counterbalance.

#### It's [not inevitable]{.underline}\-\--BUT, rollback will [only occur]{.underline} if they don't have a [shared interest]{.underline} of countering US influence. 

Christian **Shepherd 22**, MA in Contemporary Chinese Studies at
Tsinghua University, 3-21-22, "China and Russia's military relationship
likely to deepen with Ukraine war,"

As a teenager in northwestern China during the tumultuous Cultural
Revolution, Yu Bin was drafted into the army, where for four years his
training focused on how to repel a feared Russian invasion.

In 1969, the height of the Sino-Soviet split, skirmishes between the two
nations over an islet in the Ussuri River threatened to escalate into a
wider conflict as each side deployed troops and artillery to the border
region.

If war had broken out, Yu, now a political scientist at Wittenberg
University in Ohio, says he probably would have faced advanced Soviet
battle tanks with little more than a machine gun.

His experience shows how far China-Russia military ties have come since
that dispute. "[If you talk about the military-to-military
relationship]{.underline}, it's not just about arms sales or joint
exercises; [it's very **comprehensive** and **gradually
developed**]{.underline}," he said.

Regardless of whether China becomes directly involved in Russian
President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, [the conflict is shaping
up to be an **important milestone** in the two countries' **military
partnership**]{.underline}, much like the annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Just as [Western sanctions]{.underline} that year [gave Russia's
military industrial complex new impetus to sell technology to
the]{.underline} [P]{.underline}eople's [L]{.underline}iberation
[A]{.underline}rmy, [the Kremlin's reliance on China after its Ukraine
invasion could accelerate nascent joint technology development and
operations.]{.underline}

After decades of [China]{.underline} primarily [buying arms from Russia,
rapid advances in China's military industry have **balanced out the
relationship**, with some Chinese technologies beginning to **surpass
Russian counterparts**, at a time of **growing political alignment**
between the two nations.]{.underline}

The partnership stops short of a formal military alliance, which Chinese
officials say is unnecessary for the two nuclear-armed states. Instead
[it allows each side to pick and choose **when to join in the projection
of power**]{.underline} --- most [often in response to **shared
grievances against the United States**]{.underline} --- [without forcing
a stance on each other's territorial disputes.]{.underline}

Nearly a month in, the war in [Ukraine has tested the limits of
Beijing's support]{.underline}, as [China ostensibly pursues a policy of
neutrality even while refusing to criticize the Kremlin, blaming NATO
for the crisis]{.underline}, and promoting Russian disinformation about
U.S.-backed biological programs in Ukraine.

According to U.S. officials, Russia asked for Chinese military aid
shortly after the invasion began. Moscow and Beijing both deny the
reports.

Military analysts say China could aid Russia's invasion substantially by
providing basic supplies, ammunition, communications equipment and
weaponry such as drones, but is unlikely to send anything beyond basic
provisions or potentially some dual-use items such as trucks.

To do so would be a diplomatically perilous step for Beijing and risk
abandoning an often tricky effort to minimize its involvement in a
conflict that is increasingly targeting civilians. Advanced equipment
would also be difficult to integrate into Russian forces quickly.

These constraints suggest that "supplies are mostly likely in the short
term --- if Beijing makes the strategic decision to move even closer to
Moscow," said M. Taylor Fravel, director of the Security Studies Program
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Also a consideration is China's relationship with Ukraine, supported in
part by the latter's willingness to provide critical military systems
and its long-standing stance of noninterference. As Yu, of Wittenberg
University, put it: "When two friends are fighting, are you going to
give one of them a knife?"

But if precedent holds, [the crisis may ultimately **accelerate
China-Russia military cooperation**.]{.underline}

[After]{.underline} Russia's annexation of [Crimea, China continued to
build ties with the Kremlin]{.underline}, using Russia's isolation to
break through lingering mistrust and fears of intellectual property
theft that had held back sales of sensitive military technology.

Before 2012, when Xi Jinping became general secretary of the Chinese
Communist Party, the China-Russia military-to-military relationship was
in a lull, as bilateral arms sales declined because of Russian concerns
that China could reverse-engineer its technologies as well as growing
international competition from Chinese arms manufacturers.

But starting in 2013, Xi spearheaded a pivot to Russia, choosing it for
his first overseas trip, and forged a close personal relationship with
Putin. For the Chinese military, already unable to buy U.S. arms because
of an embargo imposed after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown,
sanctions imposed on the Russian arms industry over Crimea were a path
to securing better deals.

"From that moment, we have seen sales of top-notch, first-rate and
state-of-the-art Russian arms technology to China," said Sarah
Kirchberger, a scholar at Kiel University in Germany. "Previously,
Russia was only willing to sell things that were older, at least one
generation older, than what it would sell to other customers and what it
would use itself."

The shift was sealed with Chinese purchases of Su-35 fighter jets and
the S-400 surface-to-air missile defense system. In recent years, the
relationship has been furthered with joint naval drills in far-flung
international waters and missile defense computer simulations that
require a higher level of mutual trust and intelligence-sharing.

A number of joint development projects have also been disclosed, mostly
by Russia, including for heavy-lift helicopters, an early-warning system
for missile attacks, and nonnuclear submarines.

Little information is publicly available about these initiatives --- and
some may never materialize --- but taken together, the projects suggest
a shift from China being purely a customer to being a partner.
"Submarine technology is something you do not share with others very
easily," Kirchberger said. "That would really indicate a whole new level
of cooperation, if it is actually true."

While the threat of sanctions may constrain China from providing overt
military aid to Russia in Ukraine, an extended rupture with the West
will encourage the Kremlin to deliver even more advanced systems and
allow more technology transfers to China, according to Paul Schwartz, an
analyst at CNA, a research organization in Arlington, Va.

"At the same time, China [will conceivably become an important supplier
to Russia of underlying military technologies and components as well as
systems where China holds a lead]{.underline} --- sometimes a
substantial lead --- over Russia," Schwartz said, listing drones,
shipbuilding and maritime radar systems as areas where advanced Chinese
technology could interest Russia.

[**Space** is another area where the two are working closely on
technologies and systems with potential military
applications]{.underline}, including the integration of the two
country's GPS equivalents: China's Beidou network and Russia's GLONASS.

Obstacles to a closer military relationship remain, however. [Russia
continues to worry about theft of its technology]{.underline},
[international competition from Chinese arms manufacturers]{.underline}
and even the possibility that a militarily strong China might not always
treat Russia as an equal partner.

[China may be hesitant]{.underline} to take advantage of the Ukraine war
to expand military ties. While Chinese officials say normal trade with
Russia will continue, Beijing has adopted a wait-and-see approach to the
conflict, in part to minimize its exposure to sanctions and avoid
unraveling already frayed relations with Western Europe and the United
States.

**[But]{.underline}** [Xi's long-term bet on Russia as a **partner in
challenging Western security blocs** makes a **rollback of military ties
unlikely**]{.underline}. In addition to arms trade and joint exercises,
[the two powers have **increasingly coordinated opposition to security
partnerships** involving the United States and its allies]{.underline}.

[China has lent support to Russian complaints about the **expansion of
NATO**]{.underline}, while [Russia has condemned initiatives such as the
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue and AUKUS]{.underline}, both of which
Beijing blames for stoking tensions in the Pacific.

On Sunday, for example, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng told a
forum in Beijing that the United States' Indo-Pacific strategy was
provoking trouble and causing a formation of blocs in the region that
"is as dangerous as the NATO strategy of eastward expansion in Europe."

All Paths Lead to Partnership

It is plausible that the trajectory of the war in Ukraine will determine
the course of the Russia-China relationship. Some [analysts have
argued]{.underline}, for example, that if Putin faces a clear defeat,
[Xi will look to distance himself]{.underline} from a weakened and
discredited partner. This brief posits, however, [that **all roads lead
to partnership**]{.underline}. Except in the still unlikely case in
which Russia uses chemical or nuclear weapons, [China and Russia will
**deepen their ties irrespective**]{.underline} of the outcome
[of]{.underline} the war in [**Ukraine**, leaving the two more **clearly
aligned in an anti-Western partnership**]{.underline}.

Regardless of how the war in Ukraine ends, Russia will indeed emerge as
a weakened and more isolated country. [This result will
not]{.underline}, however, [weaken its bonds with China.
Russia's]{.underline} new [reality will make Moscow more dependent on
China, and previous concerns about the growing asymmetry]{.underline}
between the two countries---long touted as a constraint on future
Russia-China relations---[will be **overshadowed** by the **Kremlin's
sense of threat from the West and internal challenges**]{.underline}.
For China and Xi, meanwhile, [a weakened Russia would create some
urgency for China to mitigate pressure imposed on Putin]{.underline}
that could destabilize him internally. Chinese leaders judge that if
Putin falls, the United States would be free to focus all its attention
on countering China's rise and undermining the CCP's grip on power.
Greater Western pressure could be even more difficult to manage if it
occurs in tandem with the imperative to navigate relations with a
post-Putin Russia that could adopt a less friendly approach to China and
prompt newfound concerns about security along their shared 2,600-mile
border. Moreover, Russia's diminished strength could be useful in that
it makes Moscow even more dependent on China and, therefore, a more
loyal partner in Beijing's fight against the United States.

Critically, it remains unclear just how weakened Russia will be. Yes,
[Putin made a mistake in Ukraine, but it **is not a fatal one**. Moscow
will be]{.underline} economically weaker and increasingly [isolated, but
Russia will retain sufficient capacity and resolve to threaten U.S. and
European interests]{.underline}. To illustrate, many of the military
capabilities that the United States worries about most---Russia's
[submarines, strategic and tactical nuclear arsenal, and cyber and
electronic warfare capabilities]{.underline}---[are
**untouched**]{.underline} by the war in Ukraine. Moreover, [Russia will
retain the intent to challenge the West]{.underline}. If anything, [the
more **devastating the defeat in Ukraine**, the more **dangerous Putin's
Russia may become**]{.underline}. The Kremlin has unleashed a torrent of
nationalist rhetoric inside Russia. Putin will have to find
opportunities to satiate those sentiments and demonstrate that Russia is
a power that should still be feared. For Xi, in other words,
[Russia]{.underline}, even in a weakened and isolated state after the
war, [will]{.underline} remain a nuclear superpower that **[distracts
the United States from the Indo-Pacific.]{.underline}**

#### [Toss]{.underline} any cards before Ukraine. The relationship will [survive]{.underline} because of [shared interest]{.underline}.

Interest, 3-14-22, "China and Russia forming a new axis to challenge the

For years, [international-affairs watchers have scoffed at the idea that
Beijing's and Moscow's interests **would align**]{.underline} so
closely, or that they were scared enough of the United States and its
allies, that they would become either formal or informal partners in
crime.

[Thanks to]{.underline} the war in [**Ukraine**, that day **has
arrived**]{.underline}, and we should be worried about what that means
for the New World Order.

First, this won't exactly be an alliance. It's more like Moscow is set
to become the biggest vassal state in modern history --- the price
Russian President Vladimir Putin will have to pay for his disastrous war
in Ukraine.

Putin needs China's cash, investments, military purchases, market for
commodities and overall general support to survive in the months and
years ahead.

Otherwise, with trillions of dollars of economic sanctions about to come
down on Putin's head, Russia as we know it today may simply cease to
exist.

And, of course, [China **will be there**]{.underline} --- [**don't
listen** to any vague statements that seem to suggest Beijing is
balking]{.underline} --- to provide whatever support Putin needs over
the long term.

[The C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunist [P]{.underline}arty
[looks at its new partnership with Russia]{.underline}, which will
surely be a level of support in the tens of billions of dollars per year
--- if not more --- [as the **greatest geopolitical victory** it has
**ever** secured]{.underline}.

No matter what happens with the war [in **Ukraine**]{.underline},
clearly, [China will be the only victor]{.underline}.

[For Beijing, the **greatest threat to its regime**]{.underline}, the
idea [that the US Navy and its allies could cut off China from natural
resources]{.underline} coming from the Middle East in a war,
[has]{.underline} likely **[vanished]{.underline}**.

Chinese President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping [will]{.underline} quickly
[move into Siberia and scoop up as much **oil**, **natural
gas**]{.underline} [and **raw materials**]{.underline} [as he can get
his hands on]{.underline}. China will no longer be dependent on the sea
for survival --- and that is huge.

[Xi will also be able to transform China into a **real military
superpower**, one that can compete and defeat the United States on the
future **battlefields of Asia**]{.underline}. As no nation will likely
buy Russian arms for years, Putin will drop any worries about selling
such arms to Beijing. [China could have access to Russia's most powerful
**hypersonic technology**, **stealth submarine research**, **missile
weaponry** and much more]{.underline}.

And then there is the not-so-sexy but transformative stuff. [China
will]{.underline} surely want to [get its hands on]{.underline} the
[millions of unused acres of land to farm and develop an **alternative
food source**]{.underline}, again, so [it will not have to depend on
sources of food]{.underline} over sea routes the US Navy could block.

Security Dilemma

The security dilemma is a paradox in international politics \-- the more
a state tries to increase its own security, it decreases security for
other states.78 Within the security dilemma states have the fear of
being exploited which \'most strongly drives the security dilemma\'.79
Due to the anarchical (meaning no central authority) nature of the
international system, states do not and cannot afford to trust each
other. Thus, the security dilemma is difficult for states to avoid; as
same states increase their security, other states will feel more
insecure and increase their own security and the cycle repeats. States
that wish to form an alliance face a security dilemma, which is best
exemplified by the prisoner\'s dilemma game.80 Glenn Snyder has used
N-person positive sum games, such as prisoner\'s dilemma, to determine
alliance formation in the nineteenth century.81

The prisoner\'s dilemma is a positive sum game in which two prisoners
are taken to separate interrogation rooms, wherein they are given
different choices that offer both risk and reward. [If one of the
prisoners does not confess, he risks being \'sold out\' by his ally in
the other room. If he does confess, and the other prisoner does as well
then he runs the risk of going to jail with his confession.]{.underline}
However, if one of the prisoner\'s does confess and the other does not,
then the confessed prisoner may be rewarded with a reduced sentence. If
neither prisoner confesses however, then they both may be rewarded with
freedom. However, [neither prisoner **knows what the other will
do**]{.underline}, thus the dilemma. It is much the same situation in
alliance formation, for \'who aligns with whom results from a bargaining
process that is theoretically indeterminate\'.82

There are two parts to the security dilemma in alliance formation. The
first part begins [when states determine whether to join an
alliance.]{.underline} In a multipolar system, states have a choice of
alliances to join. [The **risks and rewards of joining**]{.underline} or
not 34 joining any given alliance [can be illustrated in the prisoner\'s
dilemma. The table below shows four alliances in Eurasia that a state in
that region could potentially join]{.underline}, with some caveats; the
European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP), which is the collective
security arm of the European Union (EU), is contingent on membership in
the EU and requires its members to have certain standards with regard to
democracy and human rights. Each alliance has a dominant state, a Great
Power, and exists in regions that sometimes overlap with other
alliances. Any other state that is a member of these alliances will have
to bandwagon with the more dominant states.

Table 2. Alliance Choices for Eurasian States

![Table Description automatically

height="1.760819116360455in"}

If a state joins the SCO then it gains the rewards from that alliance,
but it also incurs the risks of being balanced by a counter-alliance
from NATO or the ESDP. Likewise, the converse would be true if a state
joined NATO or the ESDP. [Determining whether to form or join an
existing alliance structure involves a **bargaining process** akin to
the **prisoner\'s dilemma**. A state has to **weigh the costs and
benefits**]{.underline} of joining [without knowing the outcome of other
states\' decisions to do the same. The risks of]{.underline} abandonment
or [entrapment are real, just as the rewards of
protection]{.underline}.83

The second part of the alliance dilemma is after the alliance has
formed, [states must determine how firm they want their commitments
to]{.underline} be.84 The [risk entails possible **further
entrapment**]{.underline} in alliance commitments, [as well as potential
abandonment]{.underline} by allies in a time of need. An example of
abandonment in the CSTO was Russia\'s invasion of Georgia. Faced with
the potential of being entrapped by further alliance commitments, the
other states of the CSTO declined to endorse the Russian invasion. Thus,
Russia felt the reverse effect of this action, abandonment by its
allies.

[The security dilemma can **never truly be solved**]{.underline} since
both external contingencies and the reasons for the formation of
alliances are dynamic, but alliance formations afford states the ability
to mitigate some of the dangers of the dilemma, since there are payoffs
for undertaking risks. Thus, when it comes to the SCO, each member state
must ascertain whether the benefits of joining the alliance outweigh the
costs.

The prisoners\' dilemma is most commonly associated with the two-actor
game laid out in Table 3. However, other strategies may be employed by
states including: Chicken, Hero, Leader, Protector, Bully, and Big
Bully.85 With uncertainty within the international system so prevalent,
[a state **cannot be sure who to trust**]{.underline}. Indeed, [even
reliable allies can **restrain a state\'s actions**]{.underline}, such
as the case of Britain restraining the US in Indochina in 1954.86 Still,
if it is deemed conducive to a state\'s interests to cooperate with
another state in an alliance and the benefits of such an arrangement
outweigh the costs, no doubt a state will take its chances and ally with
that state.

In determining whether Russia and China will, or have, formulated an
alliance, [we can substitute \'Country A\' with Russia and \'Country B\'
with China. The purpose]{.underline} of this game [is]{.underline} not
only [to highlight the security dilemma states face, but also that at
times and **despite mistrust**, states **still need to rely on each
other**]{.underline}. Either state can restrain the other\'s actions
with a C strategy with a double CC strategy being the most mutually
beneficial for the players.88 A DD strategy (mutual defection) is one to
be avoided by the state players, if they want to continue being allies,
so presumably both states will strive for cooperation over competition.

[The alliance will **only be viable**, if both states are content or
have **mutual cooperation**]{.underline} or if either Russia or China
gets its way and the other nation does not object. As [long as there is
**appropriate burden sharing** and **generally reliable partners**,
there should]{.underline} 36 [be some **flexibility**]{.underline} among
the alliance partners. That is to say, that [neither Russia nor China
should get their way on **every given issue**]{.underline} the alliance
may confront; [compromise is the **key**]{.underline}, otherwise a state
may defect.

The illustrative games shown here are primarily framed in two-person
games, thus excluding the smaller Central Asian states. However, the
motivations of the Central Asian states for joining or maintaining the
SCO may be slightly different from the Great Powers, and will be
discussed in detail in the next section. The predominance of power and
influence remains with Russia and China, thus the two-person game is
appropriate for understanding their interactions.

remember, in the early 1970s, Kissinger brilliantly managed to exploit
the split between Moscow and Beijing to United States' advantage. Today,
the Beijing-Moscow alignment---not an axis, not an alliance---is far
deeper. And when Trump came to power, he had, I think, a sensible idea,
which was, I think, given to him by Kissinger to try to peel Russia away
from this alignment with China, and to align Russia more closely with
the United States. Of course, he was blocked in this because of
Russiagate and various scandals, US domestic politics. And so, the exact
opposite has happened, that this Belt and Road forum just recently
demonstrated just how close Russia and China have become.

THORNTON: I'll table a stab, sure. So I guess there are two issues here.
One is the extent to which in the context of our current discussion
today sort of [the deterioration in U.S.-China relations facilitates
the]{.underline}, you know, kind of **[driving together of China and
Russia]{.underline}**. And I tend to think that there is a causal
relationship there. [I don't think Russia-China is a **natural
alliance**]{.underline}. And although [they have **similar gripes**, the
biggest one is]{.underline} about [their **relations with the United
States**]{.underline}. So to the extent that [they see in **parallel
relations** with the United States **deteriorating rapidly**,
it's]{.underline} obviously [going to give them **more common
cause**]{.underline} than they would have otherwise had. But I have to
say, Peter, that I think Chinese foreign policy has also been a huge
underlying factor in the way things have deteriorated. And if you just
look at sort of the way they have gone about---in my mind,
[it's]{.underline} all [about them deciding that China is now a **big
power**]{.underline}, and it has been [sort of **disrespected**, and
we're going to **stand up for our interests** now]{.underline}, and
we're going to push back on, you know, perceived slights, you know,
around our periphery and around, you know, the international system.
And, you know, [the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea I think [is **one of those stories**]{.underline},
where, you know, [the Chinese, being a rising major power that was going
to basically **instill fear in the neighbors**]{.underline}. And [in the
context of its **rapid military buildup**, you can]{.underline}
certainly [understand how they would see that.]{.underline} And not
taking a more kind of long-term and less aggressive approach to a lot of
these maritime disputes which, frankly, are probably never going to be
solved. And that used to be the Chinese approach. You know, put it on a
shelf and find common ground. That was their big mantra for their
foreign policy. And they somehow abandoned that. And there is a lot of
discussion about why that is and what the causal factors are. But we
don't need to get into that today. But I do think that you need to look
at that change in China's approach to trace where we've come to. Now,
that's not to say that I think we should label China as an adversary. I
mean, I authored this piece at the beginning of this kind of descent in
relations saying China is not an enemy. But, you know, so I think [there
are factors in the U.S. that are making this **worse than it needs to
be**.]{.underline} And but I think now, as Evan said earlier, [the
Chinese view **almost every issue**]{.underline} around the world
[through this **prism of U.S. strategic competition**]{.underline},
which [they really see as U.S. strategic confrontation with
China]{.underline}. And so [that is going to color **everything that we
do going forward**]{.underline} until there's some prospect of an
improvement in relations, which I unfortunately don't see on the
horizon. And the **[Ukraine]{.underline}** situation [is making it
worse.]{.underline} So.

[Chinese Responses to **Ukraine**]{.underline} Crisis

Perhaps the most visible recent example of the two countries' political
cooperation is China's defense of Russia's demand for a halt to NATO
expansion and more general reiteration of Russia's key talking points on
the matter. While Moscow's veto in the United Nations Security Council
would have been adequate to thwart any U.N. action over its implicit
military threat to Ukraine, Beijing's backing prevents unified U.N.
condemnation and lends Russia a degree of legitimacy among governments
outside America's global alliance networks. Symbolically, for China's
President Xi Jinping the scheduled Feb. 4 meeting with his Russian
counterpart, Vladimir Putin, will be his first in-person summit with a
fellow head of state in almost two years.

The geopolitical implications of the Ukraine crisis for Beijing have
been a focus of intense speculation. Some observers suggest that Xi
would back a Russian invasion but prefers that it occur after the
Olympics. Others fear that China might exploit a military operation by
the Kremlin to attack Taiwan simultaneously and present America with a
"nightmare scenario" of war in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific. Yet
others warn that, deliberately or not, [**Moscow** and
**Beijing**]{.underline} [are jointly putting **considerable pressure on
NATO** member Lithuania]{.underline}---the former through its troop
deployments in neighboring Belarus, the latter with an import ban in
retaliation for Lithuania's agreement to host a Taiwan representative
office (under that name rather than "Taipei," Taiwan's capital, which
the United States and others have used to limit China's ire).

There are also China watchers who see greater caution and attempts at a
balancing act in Beijing's approach to events surrounding Ukraine. They
have pointed out, for example, that China does not recognize Crimea as
Russian territory (as Moscow does not recognize some of China's claims
in the South China Sea) and that China has cultivated certain commercial
interests in Ukraine, such as military technology, as well as
agriculture and infrastructure for its Belt and Road Initiative, and
hence would be unlikely to welcome war there.

More generally, China's government has often assigned high priority to
economic growth as a source of political legitimacy, so the possible
disruptions for the global economy (and Chinese firms) that could result
from a Russian invasion of Ukraine---especially sanctions affecting
Russia's banking sector or an energy market shock---may seem
unattractive for China's leaders as they manage their economy's pandemic
recovery. Earlier this year, a Chinese Communist Party official wrote
that maintaining economic stability was "crucial" in advance of a
forthcoming Party congress, at which observers expect Xi to pursue a
third term as president.

Allied or Not, and What to Do About It

These discussions fit into longer-term American debates surrounding
Russia's relationship with China. Though few U.S. observers would call
Moscow's current ties to Beijing an alliance, some analysts argue that
[a "three-decade-old nightmare" has become **reality**]{.underline} as
"[Beijing and Moscow have **ganged up on America**." Others see the
relationship as **geopolitically convenient for Russia's and
China's**]{.underline} leaders but [lacking the **depth
necessary**]{.underline} for a durable state-to-state alliance.

These differing viewpoints, in turn, have policy implications and thus
have prompted policy debates. Prior to Moscow's ongoing implicit
military threat to Ukraine, some suggested that Washington should try to
"lure" Russia away from China. Skeptics argued that this approach "won't
work."

[Chinese and Russian officials]{.underline}, meanwhile, [each have an
interest in playing up their relationship as they **simultaneously
manage difficulties with Washington**]{.underline}. Kremlin spokesman
Dmitry Peskov described a December videoconference between Putin and Xi
as "a discussion between allies." After the call, however, Putin's
foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov reported that Xi had acknowledged
that the two nations are not allies, yet added that the Chinese leader
claimed "their effectiveness even exceeds this level."

History Matters

It is essential to remember that Russia's post-1991 relationship with
China emerged from the troubled Soviet-Chinese relationship, which the
two countries had incentive to change for strategic reasons. The
undeclared 1969 Sino-Soviet war demonstrated to both sides the possible
consequences of enduring tensions along their 2,600-mile border. Soon
thereafter, former President Richard Nixon's 1972 opening to China
showed how Moscow's and Beijing's rivals could exploit those tensions to
the detriment of either or both parties.

After the Soviet collapse, the two sides gradually signed a series of
agreements, which helped further establish the foundation for today's
Russia-China relationship. Two border deals---the 1997 agreement
limiting troops on the Russian-Chinese border and the 2008 treaty
finalizing Russian-Chinese border demarcation---did not resolve
Russian-Chinese differences or eliminate mutual suspicions. What they
did, however, was to establish a minimum threshold of mutual trust. A
2001 Russian-Chinese friendship and cooperation treaty (renewed in 2021)
included one of the earliest formal acknowledgements that leaders in
Moscow and Beijing shared concerns over American conduct (alluding to
the 1999 U.S./NATO war against Serbia) as well as a commitment to
consult "if a threat of aggression arises."

Managing Competition Without Watching Your Back

This stance matters because presidents [Putin and Xi have]{.underline}
expansive global [ambitions that neither can fulfill if each **must
constantly watch for a knife in his back**]{.underline}. From this
perspective, the Russia-China relationship is perhaps best understood as
a non-aggression pact that has enabled deepening economic, political and
security cooperation. With their backs covered, [Moscow can face to the
west and Beijing can face to the east]{.underline}. That doesn't rule
out disagreements to Russia's north (the Arctic) or south (Central
Asia), where some Russian officials worry about China's growing
presence. [It does]{.underline}, however, [establish a framework in
which the two governments can approach their **bilateral
competition**---something the United States **currently lacks** in its
relations with either Russia or China.]{.underline}

Most important, the shared desire to avoid a military confrontation has
established a floor beneath which Russia-China relations will not
deteriorate absent a radically different strategic environment. In this
sense, those who insist that America cannot "split" Russia from China
are correct that Washington is highly unlikely to succeed in persuading
Moscow to take any steps that would threaten the foundation of its
relationship with Beijing. Still, [sophisticated U.S. policy could
create an environment in which Russia's and China's leaders do not
reflexively **align with one another** and **against the United
States**]{.underline} on most issues.

Costs and Benefits of Cooperation

[The ceiling for the Russia-China relationship]{.underline} is in theory
unlimited but in practice [depends on the **costs and benefits to each
specific form of cooperation**]{.underline} that the two governments
might undertake. Those who say that Russia and China will not form an
alliance are probably right because an alliance---as traditionally
understood---would require a mutual defense commitment, something with
potentially high costs for Moscow and Beijing since it could conceivably
draw either into the other's war with the United States and its allies.
Indeed, if one defines allies as nations willing to endure significant
costs for one another, neither Russia nor China has any such partners;
they have clients whom they can aid or not as it suits them. For Moscow
or Beijing, the marginal benefits offered by a bilateral alliance would
be little beyond those of a non-aggression arrangement, since each
country has (and would probably be prepared to use) nuclear weapons to
address military threats beyond those its conventional military forces
could handle.

Nevertheless, [that Russia and China do not have]{.underline}, and are
unlikely to create, [a full-scale alliance does n**ot constrain their
military and security cooperation**, much less **any other
cooperation**]{.underline} they might otherwise wish to pursue. [The
existing Russia-China relationship already allows for consultation and
coordination on security affairs, economic matters and]{.underline}
other [policy issues. This poses **sufficient dangers to the United
States**]{.underline} that [the absence of a Russian-Chinese mutual
defense agreement is **largely irrelevant**]{.underline}. After all,
Russian and Chinese forces would be unlikely to fight together too much
even if both countries were simultaneously at war with America. The
principal theaters for these two hypothetical wars would be thousands of
miles apart.

[Perhaps most dangerous is Russia's **sharing of military technology**
with Beijing]{.underline}, though China's technical capacity is
expanding rapidly across multiple areas. Russia's weapons sales to China
have also been a longstanding concern for America. While the volume of
these arms deals peaked in 2005---and was at just one-fifth of that
level in 2020---Russian firms have supplied China with modern systems
(such as Su-35S interceptors and S-400 air defense systems). Earlier,
Russia reportedly provided engines for China's J-20 stealth fighter.

Rubles and Yuan

Finally, [the economic relationship]{.underline} between Russia and
China [is **still deepening**]{.underline} and [this can help protect
Russia from some of the consequences of **Western
sanctions**]{.underline}, including diminished trade with the United
States and many of its allies. China's share of Russia's oil and gas
exports in 2020 were 31% and 5%, respectively. Russia's goods exports to
China, by one measure, more than tripled from \$16 billion in 2009 to
\$58 billion in 2019---about four times more than goods exports to the
U.S. for the same year. As a result, unilateral U.S. trade sanctions
have limited impact on Russia outside technology restrictions such as
those related to defense, dual-use and energy technologies, which can be
more significant. (Russia's trade with the European Union is
considerably larger than its commerce with America or China, especially
when energy exports are factored in, and Europe's largest economies are
quite unlikely to sever or even dramatically reduce their trade
relationships with Russia.)

Rules of the Game

[Security, economic and political collaboration between Russia and China
does **not rest on an authoritarian alignment**]{.underline}---though
shared defense of their governing systems contributes to it---or on a
formal alliance. Instead, [its foundation is the mutual recognition that
enduring Russia-China tensions would]{.underline} considerably
**[undermine each government's efforts]{.underline}** to secure the
global role it seeks. It is likewise notable that [their relationship
has expanded beyond that in parallel with each government's growing
frustration at attaining its aims **through cooperation with the United
States**]{.underline} and its allies in Europe and Asia. This is not to
say that all Moscow's and Beijing's goals have been entirely reasonable,
or that every effort at cooperation has been sincere. Rather, it is to
note that [from Russia's and China's perspective, Washington and its
allies are **obstructing** rather **than facilitating what leaders in
each country have seen as a legitimate desire**]{.underline} [for
**greater influence**]{.underline}, including a voice in defining the
rules of the game. Thus, [China's rhetorical support for Moscow's
efforts to force a role for itself in European security is both
**helpful to Russia and self-serving**]{.underline}. Even so, it seems
unlikely that Beijing will do too much more.

#### Ukraine is [neg]{.underline}. China views it as a [mirror]{.underline} and [more reason]{.underline} to compete with the U.S.

Policy magazine, 5-11-2022, \"China Takes Aim At NATO,\"

[China]{.underline} increasingly [sees the **war in Ukraine** \-- and
the roles of the United States and its NATO allies in backing Kyiv
against Moscow \-- as a reflection of **future tensions**]{.underline}
to come between the military bloc and Beijing in the Indo-Pacific.

Ever since Russian tanks first crossed into Ukraine on February 24,
Beijing has walked an awkward line between not giving outright support
to Moscow\'s invasion while accusing the United States and other NATO
countries of provoking the war by allowing the security alliance to
expand eastward despite protests from the Kremlin.

Now, as the war continues to grind on with the Russian military
suffering major setbacks on the battlefield, [China has ramped up its
rhetoric to **warn about NATO** and the **United States\' footprint in
Asia**]{.underline}.

[\"NATO, a military organization in the North Atlantic, has]{.underline}
in recent years **[come to the Asia-Pacific]{.underline}** region [to
throw its weight around and stir up conflicts]{.underline},\" Wang
Wenbin, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in late April.
[\"NATO has messed up Europe. Is it now trying to mess up the
Asia-Pacific and even the world?\"]{.underline}

Wang\'s comments were in response to earlier remarks from U.K. Foreign
Secretary Liz Truss, who called for boosting NATO in the wake of the
Ukraine war and warned China that it should \"play by the rules.\"

[The]{.underline} added [focus on NATO from Beijing comes as both China
and the United States see Russia\'s invasion as a f**oil for future
tensions between the two countries in Asia**. NATO said]{.underline}
last year that [it intended to focus more on **China**]{.underline} and
[Beijing is expected to play a large role in the bloc\'s strategy moving
forward]{.underline}.

Likewise, Washington is increasingly convinced that the conflict
provides it with an unexpected advantage in the long term, with
Bloomberg reporting on May 10 that U.S. officials believe that bolstered
European defense spending and a weakened Russia could allow it to
accelerate a security shift toward China.

[Those aims are part of the **shared distrust toward NATO**]{.underline}
[and the United States that has led Beijing and Moscow to **become
closer in recent years**]{.underline} and why many analysts believe that
[China has **not abandoned Russia** throughout its]{.underline} brutal
[war in Ukraine]{.underline}.

Similarly, experts and Western officials warn that [Beijing is **closely
watching the response to Russia\'s invasion**]{.underline} and [drawing
potential lessons for any **tensions over Taiwan**]{.underline}, which
[China]{.underline} claims as its territory and [has threatened to
**invade**]{.underline} if Taipei refuses to submit to its control.

\"If China joins the West in condemning Russia, it will be much
applauded in Washington and most European capitals. But it will lose
Russia\'s partnership,\" Senior Colonel Zhou Bo, a retired officer of
China\'s People\'s Liberation Army (PLA), wrote in The Economist on May
9. [\"]{.underline}And it is only a matter of time before America takes
on China again. The [Biden]{.underline} administration[\'s]{.underline}
[policy towards my country is **\'extreme competition\'**]{.underline}
that stops just short of war.[\"]{.underline}

Ukraine War As a \'Mirror\'

The parallels drawn between U.S. strategy in the Indo-Pacific and
NATO\'s expansion in Europe are not new, with both China and Russia
underlining this point in the 5,000-word joint statement they released
in February when Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian counterpart
Vladimir Putin declared [a \"no-limits\" partnership]{.underline}.

[The document voiced their opposition to the \"**further enlargement of
NATO**]{.underline}\" and [pledged to \"remain highly vigilant about the
negative impact of the United States\' Indo-Pacific
strategy.\"]{.underline}

Despite Chinese protests, experts point out there are key differences
between NATO\'s role and U.S. strategy in the Indo-Pacific region, which
also includes a wider range of economic and political policies beyond
the bloc and the United States dealing with its long Pacific Ocean
border.

Still, the Ukraine war is set to affect the region, with Chinese Deputy
Foreign Minister Le Yucheng saying in March that [the crisis could be
used as a \"**mirror**\" to view the security situation in the
Asia-Pacific region]{.underline}.

For the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden, the move toward Asia
is seen as critical and long overdue.

Washington has increasingly warned about China abusing its military and
economic clout in the region, pointing to the country\'s moves to exert
greater control over Hong Kong, expand its military presence in the
South China Sea, and crack down on human rights in Xinjiang Province,
which has seen more than 1 million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslim
minorities interned in camps.

But while both U.S. and Chinese officials see parallels between the
Ukraine war and rising tensions in Asia, they are each drawing different
lessons.

[U.S. officials continue to view **increased defense spending in
Europe**, as well as both **Finland** and **Sweden** on a]{.underline}n
immediate [path toward **NATO membership**]{.underline}, as [positive
security developments that could allow the United States to follow
through on its long-delayed \"pivot to Asia.\"]{.underline} That policy
was first outlined by U.S. President Barack Obama and the move is seen
as necessary as U.S. policy circles increasingly view China, not Russia,
as the country\'s main military adversary.

Chinese officials and experts, however, are reaching different
conclusions from the reflections they see in Ukraine.

[Beijing]{.underline} \-- and Xi in particular \-- [has long supported
\"**strategic autonomy**,\"]{.underline} a concept pushed by French
President Emmanuel Macron that calls for Europe to play a more
independent role in its defense that relies less on the United States.

In a May 10 call with Macron, Xi pushed the French president and other
European leaders to take security \"into their own hands,\" echoing
earlier comments from a May 9 call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

While the long-term implications of the Ukraine war are still uncertain,
as is the future of European \"strategic autonomy,\" [Beijing
increasingly seems to believe that it could further **delay the U.S.
strategic pivot**]{.underline} to China [and lead to a lasting division
among **European and NATO allies**]{.underline}.

\"Joe Biden had hoped to put Russia policy on a \'stable and
predictable\' footing in order to focus on America\'s Indo-Pacific
strategy. The war in Ukraine undoubtedly will distract America\'s
attention and \[siphon\] away resources,\" wrote Zhou, the retired PLA
officer. \"The question is\...how long Mr. Biden will allow Ukraine to
remain a distraction.\"

### RCA Impact\-\--2NC 

#### Kaushiki says trade wars: they escalate. 

Gordan **Chang 19**, J.D. Cornell and author, 7-11-19, "When 'Trade
Wars' End Badly,"
<https://www.hoover.org/research/when-trade-wars-end-badly>, jy

Second, escalating trade friction is convincing the business community
that disagreements will continue for a long time. As Joseph Foudy of New
York University Stern Business School told CNN, it is not the additional
tariffs that are motivating companies to exit China. "It's the
uncertainty that drives you to look abroad because you can't put a price
on that," he said.

Despite what Chinese officials call "decoupling," there will still be a
high volume of trade between the two countries. Many, therefore, think
[economic ties will continue to **stabilize relations**. Trade and
investment have often been called the "**ballast**" of Sino-U.S.
ties.]{.underline}

[Perhaps they will no **longer**]{.underline} be. "Does trade increase
or decrease the likelihood of conflict?" Samuel Huntington, the great
Harvard political scientist, asked in his landmark work, The Clash of
Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order. "The assumption that it
reduces the probability of war between nations is, at a minimum, not
proven, and much evidence exists to the contrary."

As many have now pointed out, high levels of trade in the first years of
the last century did not prevent the First World War. As Huntington,
building on the work of others, pointed out, [what is important is
**expectation**. "Economic interdependence fosters peace]{.underline},"
he wrote, "[**only** 'when states expect that high trade levels will
continue]{.underline} into the foreseeable future.'" [If]{.underline},
however, [trade partners "do not expect high levels of interdependence
to continue, **war** is **likely to result**."]{.underline}

Of course, [war does not inevitably result when countries believe they
will delink their economies. Yet the threshold for the use of force will
**drop** when Americans believe China poses an **existential
threat**]{.underline}.

Beijing, unfortunately, continually provides evidence that it is
America's enemy. In April of last year, for instance, the Chinese
military, from its base in Djibouti, lasered a C-130 Hercules cargo
plane, causing eye injuries to two military pilots. American planes are
continually lasered in the East China Sea by Chinese forces.
Furthermore, last year sonic waves caused brain injuries to American
diplomats at the Guangzhou consulate. Because the Communist Party runs a
surveillance state, Chinese officials either were the perpetrators of
this crime or complicit in it. Soon, Americans will ask why they should
trade with a state that uses the proceeds of commerce to harm their
service personnel and diplomats. Beijing is leaving its most important
trading partner no choice.

So what will be the result of the U.S.-China trade war? [Commerce and
investment between the U.S. and China will **decline**, friction between
the two countries will **soar**]{.underline}, and people will reread The
Clash of Civilizations.

**[Nonmilitary collaboration]{.underline}** between Russia and China
[could **weaken the United States** and even **threaten its way of

to]{.underline}, as the director of national intelligence put it in

currently does not exhibit Russia's zeal for using such measures,

Italy. [This engagement will ultimately **translate** into **political

[Russia, for its part, appears intent on pursuing hybrid tactics that
**disrupt democratic processes**.]{.underline} On their own, each of

One way to do so is to compare today's international material power
structure to that of the Cold War -- when the pressure for the two major
superpowers to balance was high and when two competing blocks
effectively contained each other. While such comparison is unavoidably a
gross simplification, it provides a first-cut picture of the power
dynamics within the international system. The changes of GNP and
military expenditures reveal that the current power structure is nearing
that of the Cold War and is therefore conducive to the formation of a
China--Russia alliance. In 1991, the total GNP of the United States was
almost 16 times that of China and 12 times that of Russia (US\$6.164
trillion vs US\$405.714 billion and US\$517.953 billion, respectively).
By 2015, China's GNP had 60% of that of the United States (US\$11.226
trillion versus US\$18.121 trillion). Meanwhile, Russia has shown an
11-fold increase in GNP from a meager US\$196 billion in 1999 (the
post-Soviet low) to US\$2.13 trillion in 2013, which is one-seventh of
the GNP of the United States.50 Even given the devaluation of the
Russian ruble in 2014 and, as a result, the shrinkage of the nominal
dollar value of Russia's GNP in 2015 by almost 40%, combining China's
and Russia's GNPs would create a pole that, as a percentage of US GNP,
is close to the Soviet Union's Cold War peak of 1975 when the Soviet GNP
reached 58% of the United States total.51 At the same time, the United
States has been cutting its military spending substantially over the
last several years: in 2011, 2012, and 2013, it cut military spending to
US\$711.3 billion, US\$684.8 billion, and US\$640.2 billion,
respectively; the figure further dropped to US\$596 billion in 2015.52
China now has the world's second largest military budget of US\$188.6
billion, followed by Russia with its US\$88 billion.53 The purchasing
power parity (PPP)-adjusted estimates of China's military budget reached
US\$314 billion in 2014, which, if combined with Russia's military
power, also reaches the level of the Cold War's USSR-versus-US
proportions.54 With all the caveats, these figures show that [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [**still overpowers** [a
China-Russia]{.mark} **hypothetical [alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline} by
considerable margins; [however, [the **power threshold**]{.mark} **it
generates** [has become **less insurmountable**, opening **structural
opportunities** for China and Russia to **successfully balance the
U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates.]{.underline}

However, changes in the gross domestic product (GDP) and military
expenditures are only part of the story of the increasing systemic
pressure. The second part has to do with the actual behavior of great
powers and the nature of their interactions. [The international system's
acquisition of a structure that makes **[systemic balancing]{.mark}**
more feasible **[emboldens]{.mark} potential [challengers]{.mark}** and
**reduces** the possibilities for the major great powers to **remain
unaffected** by each other's behavior]{.underline}. [[Feeling **more
confident** about their capabilities, the challenger states adopt **more
assertive foreign policies**]{.mark} in various regions [that provoke a
**degenerative spiral of reactions** involving the hegemon and **further
precipitate**]{.mark} the **[increased systemic
pressure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This process manifests itself in the
emergence, proliferation, and intensification of what Buzan and Wæver
termed geopolitically charged regional security complexes (RSC)55 --
highly contentious, great-powers-dominated regional settings in which
'the members are so interrelated in terms of their security that actions
by any one member, and significant security-related developments inside
any member, have a major impact on others'.56

2.2 Implications and Consequences of a "Model B" Alliance---Dangerous
and Not Unlikely

Even the most limited case of a "Model A" type cooperation, and
certainly the moderate "Model B" version of a Russian-Chinese de facto
military alliance would have far-reaching consequences for Europe's
security. Conversely, "Model C" seems as yet unlikely (though not
entirely impossible). Therefore, this analysis focuses on Model B as a
worst-case scenario that cannot be ruled out nor deemed highly unlikely,
and discusses its possible consequences for Europe's security. Model B
supposes an opportunistic rather than a strategic alliance between
Russia and China. This means a de-facto military alliance where both
[Russia and China are **united in their geopolitical
intent**]{.underline} [to change the international rules-based order
**according to their interests**; jointly undermine the unity and
resolve within Western institutions and US-led alliances]{.underline};
and follow a "division of labor" principle, taking separate approaches
in their respective regions without strictly coordinating their plans
and activities. The framework of such a non-formalized, purpose-driven
de facto alliance would not be based on a coordinated geostrategic
approach and would not be underpinned by integrated operational
planning, and would therefore also not include pre-planned mutual
support in case of a conflict with military land, air or naval forces.
However, [even such a **moderate kind**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} de
facto military [alliance between Russia and China would have
far-reaching **negative consequences for NATO**]{.underline} in Europe,
[both at the **geopolitical** and **strategic-operational level**, and
could become a **nightmare scenario for Europe's
security**]{.underline}. What could this look like, and how can it be
prevented from happening?

2.3 A "Nightmare Scenario" Based on "Model B": War Between China and the
USA in the Indo-Pacific Creates an Opportunity for Russia to Achieve
Revisionist Aims in Europe

In this scenario, [an]{.underline} opportunistic, [audacious Russian
leader uses the opportunity of an escalating major confrontation between
**China and the USA in the Indo-Pacific region** to **simultaneously
test NATO**]{.underline} in Europe [with the aim of achieving as many of
his **revisionist territorial**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[geopolitical goals]{.underline}** as possible. Such an opportunistic
large-scale attack against NATO in Europe, conducted by Russia while the
USA is fully engaged in a major war with China in the Indo-Pacific,
becomes more likely the more some particular prerequisites would occur.
The following list contains such elements that could change the risk
calculus in Moscow.

[Russian willingness to accept the risk of launching a large, military
campaign of high intensity with regular forces]{.underline} (i.e. a
regional war) in Europe [would **rise**]{.underline},

\(a\)

[if the USA got engaged in a **major conflict with China** in the
Indo-Pacific region and both sides escalated]{.underline} the conflict
to high intensity military campaigns rather than keeping their power
struggle limited to political, diplomatic, economic or other
non-military instruments;

\(b\)

[if in such a conflict with China, the USA were forced to commit
all]{.underline} available air, land, maritime and other [forces and
capabilities to this theater of war in order to gain the upper
hand]{.underline};

\(c\)

[if the USA's focus on major military confrontation with China created
significant gaps in NATO's deterrence]{.underline} and defense posture
in Europe and the Europeans were unwilling or unable to fill those
gapsFootnote3;

\(d\)

and [if Germany]{.underline}, as the key NATO ally in Europe's center,
or a group of allies around Germany, [could be discouraged by hybrid
activities or nuclear coercion from fulfilling their NATO
commitments]{.underline} in peacetime, during the transition from
peacetime to crisis and conflict, or during the course of war. [This
would be the case]{.underline}, e.g., [if the political and military
decision-making process were **delayed**]{.underline}, the transfer of
authority regarding in-place formations was not timely transferred,
reinforcements were not rapidly deployed, or if Germany did not fully
play its critical role in the Supreme Allied Commander Europe's (SACEUR)
rear area of operations.

[Russia's leadership would be **even more encouraged to take
risks**]{.underline} [if]{.underline} they could plausibly rely on the
following assumptions regarding their ally China:

\(a\)

Firstly, [as a result of China's military buildup]{.underline} in terms
of quantity and quality, especially in the maritime, air, space, cyber
and also nuclear dimensions over recent years, [China would be **capable
and willing to engage the US in a full-blown war**]{.underline}, and
China would no longer be forced to avoid confrontation due to military
weakness. As of this writing, [there is **no reason** any more for
**China to fear rapid defeat** right from the outset of
hostilities]{.underline}, while **[unlike in the past]{.underline}**, US
military planners now need to take significant US losses into
account.Footnote4

\(b\)

Secondly, a military conflict between the US and China would be
large-scale and long-lasting, so that in the USA, not much attention,
political energy, military forces and capabilities would be left for a
crisis provoked by Russia in other regions of secondary priority, e.g.
in Europe's Baltic Sea region. [It would be helpful for Russia if
China's assertiveness created the perception in the USA that a military
confrontation is **unavoidable**]{.underline} sooner or later. This
would imply that the USA would re-allocate the bulk of its air and naval
forces as well as its force-multiplying enablers to the Indo-Pacific
region and also make these services their budgetary priority at the
expense of the US army. [For deterrence and defense in Europe, this
would mean that in the land domain only]{.underline}, a minimum of
reinforcements could be expected, and that the key prerequisite for any
success on the ground---a favorable air situation---[would have to be
achieved by **European air forces**]{.underline}.Footnote5 As of late
2021, none of the European nations had any comparable capacity nor the
plans or budgets to compensate for such a strategic re-allocation of US
forces and capabilities.

\(c\)

Thirdly, [Russia would have a **free hand**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} perhaps [could count on Chinese support with **covert
or open hybrid activities**]{.underline} against all critical elements
of NATO's and the EU's posture.

\(d\)

Fourthly, with regard to China, [no precautionary measures would be
needed]{.underline} in the Far East (Siberia, Arctic) to protect
Russia's territorial integrity and strategic interests from China.

Needless to say, the Russian calculus would be most encouraged to take
on high risks:

\(a\)

if China contributed pro-actively with substantial forces and
capabilities (including disruptive technologies and future force
multiplying enablers) to coordinated conventional military operations
beyond covert hybrid support. This could be done at Europe's southern
flank with a "second front," e.g. through a deployment of Chinese naval
forces and land-based missile systems for additional A2/AD bubbles for
sea denial in the Mediterranean and along Europe's sea lines of
communication to its partners in the Indo-Pacific;

\(b\)

[if China closely cooperated with Russia vis-à-vis Europe in **coercive
nuclear messaging** and in their strategic missile
activities]{.underline} (and vice versa Russia with China in the
Indo-Pacific theater).Footnote6

These points are important for answering the question of what Europeans
can and should do to prevent their nightmare scenario from becoming
reality. Point by point, they indicate exactly what European NATO
nations can and in their own best interest must do to discourage or deny
every single prerequisite. Overall, they must strive to prevent any
constellation in which these prerequisites all apply together.

[Sino-Russian relations have been **adapting to**]{.underline} an era of
[**great-power rivalry**. This]{.underline} complex relationship,
categorised as a 'comprehensive [strategic partnership of
coordination]{.underline} for a new era', [has continued to evolve as
**global strategic competition has intensified**]{.underline}.1 [China
and Russia]{.underline} have not only expanded military cooperation but
[are also undertaking more extensive **technological cooperation**,
including]{.underline} in fifth-generation telecommunications,
artificial intelligence (**[AI]{.underline}**),
**[biotechnology]{.underline}** [and the **digital
economy**]{.underline}.

When Russia and China commemorated the 70th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between Soviet Union and the
People's Republic of China in October 2019,2 the celebrations
highlighted the history of this 'friendship' and a positive agenda for
contemporary partnership that is pursuing bilateral security, 'the
spirit of innovation', and 'cooperation in all areas'.3

Such [partnerships show]{.underline} that [Beijing and Moscow recognise
the potential synergies of joining forces in the development of these
**dual-use technologies**]{.underline}, which possess clear military and
commercial significance. [This]{.underline} distinct deepening of
China--Russia technological collaborations [is also a response to
**increased pressures imposed by the US**]{.underline}. Over the past
couple of years, US policy has sought to limit Chinese and Russian
engagements with the global technological ecosystem, including through
sanctions and export controls. Under these geopolitical circumstances,
the [determination of Chinese and Russian leaders to develop indigenous
replacements for foreign, particularly American
technologies]{.underline}, from chips to operating systems, [has
provided further motivation for cooperation]{.underline}.

[These advances in authoritarian innovation should **provoke
concerns**]{.underline} for democracies for reasons of security, human
rights, and overall competitiveness. Notably, the [Chinese and Russian
governments are also cooperating on techniques for **improved
censorship** and **surveillance**]{.underline} [and increasingly
coordinating on approaches to governance that justify and promote their
**preferred approach of cyber sovereignty**]{.underline} and internet
management, to other countries and through international standards and
other institutions. [Today's trends in technological collaboration and
competition also possess **strategic** and **ideological** implications
for **great-power rivalry**.]{.underline}

#### Worse than extinction.

Di **Minardi 20**, MA Political Science at Boston College, 10-15-20,\
"The grim fate that could be 'worse than extinction',"
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201014-totalitarian-world-in-chains-artificial-intelligence

What would totalitarian governments of the past have looked like if they
were never defeated? The Nazis operated with 20th Century technology and
it still took a world war to stop them. How much more powerful -- and
permanent -- could the Nazis have been if they had beat the US to the
atomic bomb? Controlling the most advanced technology of the time could
have solidified Nazi power and changed the course of history.

When [we think of **existential risks**, events like **nuclear
war**]{.underline} or asteroid impacts often [come to mind. Yet there's
one future threat that]{.underline} is **[less well known]{.underline}**
-- and while it doesn't involve the extinction of our species, [it could
be **just as bad**.]{.underline}

It's called the "world in chains" scenario, where, like the preceding
thought experiment, [a global totalitarian government uses a novel
technology to lock a majority of the world into **perpetual
suffering**]{.underline}. If it sounds grim, you'd be right. But is it
likely? Researchers and philosophers are beginning to ponder how it
might come about -- and, more importantly, what we can do to avoid it.

Existential risks (**[x-risks]{.underline}**) [are disastrous because
they lock humanity into a **single fate**, like the permanent collapse
of civilisation or the extinction of our species.]{.underline} These
catastrophes can have natural causes, like an asteroid impact or a
supervolcano, or be human-made from sources like nuclear war or climate
change. Allowing one to happen would be "an abject end to the human
story\" and would let down the hundreds of generations that came before
us, says Haydn Belfield, academic project manager at the Centre for the
Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge.

Toby Ord, a senior research fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute
(FHI) at Oxford University, believes that the odds of an existential
catastrophe happening this century from natural causes are less than one
in 2,000, because humans have survived for 2,000 centuries without one.
However, when he adds the probability of human-made disasters, Ord
believes the chances increase to a startling one in six. He refers to
this century as "the precipice" because the risk of losing our future
has never been so high.

Researchers at the Center on Long-Term Risk, a non-profit research
institute in London, have expanded upon x-risks with the
even-more-chilling prospect of suffering risks. These
"**[s-risks]{.underline}**" [are defined as "suffering on an
**astronomical scale**, vastly exceeding all suffering that has existed
on Earth so far]{.underline}." In these scenarios, [life
**continues**]{.underline} for billions of people, [but the quality is
**so low** and the **outlook so bleak**]{.underline} that [dying out
would be **preferable**.]{.underline} In short: [a future with
**negative value**]{.underline} [is worse than one **with no value at
all**]{.underline}.

This is where the "world in chains" scenario comes in. If [a
**malevolent group**]{.underline} or government suddenly
[gained]{.underline} **[world-dominating power through
technology]{.underline}**, and there was nothing to stand in its way,
[it could lead to an extended period of **abject suffering and
subjugation**]{.underline}. A 2017 report on existential risks from the
Global Priorities Project, in conjunction with FHI and the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs of Finland, warned that ["a long future under
a]{.underline} particularly brutal [global totalitarian state could
**arguably be worse than complete extinction**]{.underline}".

Singleton hypothesis

Though global totalitarianism is still a niche topic of study,
researchers in the field of existential risk are increasingly turning
their attention to [its most likely cause: **artificial
intelligence**]{.underline}.

In his "singleton hypothesis", Nick Bostrom, director at Oxford's FHI,
has explained how [a global government]{.underline} [could form with
AI]{.underline} or other powerful technologies -- [and why it might be
**impossible to overthrow**]{.underline}. He writes that [a world with
"a single decision-making agency at the highest level" could occur if
that agency "obtains a decisive lead through a **technological
breakthrough**]{.underline} in artificial intelligence or molecular
nanotechnology". Once in charge, [it would control advances in
technology that prevent **internal challenges**, like
**surveillance**]{.underline} or autonomous weapons, [and]{.underline},
with this monopoly, [remain **perpetually stable**]{.underline}.

If the singleton is totalitarian, [life would be **bleak**]{.underline}.
Even in the countries with the strictest regimes, news leaks in and out
from other countries and people can escape. [A global totalitarian rule
would eliminate even these small seeds of hope. To be worse than
extinction, "that would mean we feel **absolutely no freedom**, **no
privacy**, **no hope of escaping**, **no agency to control our lives at
all**]{.underline}\", says Tucker Davey, a writer at the Future of Life
Institute in Massachusetts, which focuses on existential risk research.

"[In totalitarian regimes of the past]{.underline}, \[[there
was]{.underline}\] so much [paranoia and psychological suffering because
you just have no idea if you\'re going to get **killed**]{.underline}
for saying the wrong thing," he continues. "[And now imagine that
**there\'s not even a question**]{.underline}, every single thing you
say is being reported and being analysed."

"We may not yet have the technologies to do this," Ord said in a recent
interview, "but [it looks like the kinds of technologies we're
developing make that **easier and easier**]{.underline}. And it seems
plausible that [this may become possible at some time in the next **100
years**]{.underline}."

AI and authoritarianism

Though life under a global totalitarian government is still an unlikely
and far-future scenario, [AI is **already enabling
authoritarianism**]{.underline} in some countries and strengthening
[infrastructure that could be **seized by an opportunistic despot in
others**]{.underline}.

"We\'ve seen sort of a reckoning with the shift from very utopian
[visions of]{.underline} what [tech]{.underline}nology might bring to
much more sobering realities that [are]{.underline}, in some respects,
**[already quite dystopian]{.underline}**," says Elsa Kania, an adjunct
senior fellow at the Center for New American Security, a bipartisan
non-profit that develops national security and defence policies.

In the past, surveillance required hundreds of thousands of people --
one in every 100 citizens in East Germany was an informant -- but now it
can be done by technology. In the United States, the National Security
Agency (NSA) collected hundreds of millions of American call and text
records before they stopped domestic surveillance in 2019, and there are
an estimated four to six million CCTV cameras across the United Kingdom.
Eighteen of the 20 most surveilled cities in the world are in China, but
London is the third. The difference between them lies less in the tech
that the countries employ and more in how they use it.

What if the definition of what is illegal in the US and the UK expanded
to include criticising the government or practising certain religions?
The infrastructure is already in place to enforce it, and AI -- which
the NSA has already begun experimenting with -- would enable agencies to
search through our data faster than ever before.

In addition to enhancing surveillance, [AI also underpins the growth of
**online misinformation**]{.underline}, which is another [tool of the
**authoritarian**]{.underline}. AI-powered **[deep fakes]{.underline}**,
which [can spread **fabricated political messages**]{.underline}, [and
algorithmic micro-targeting on social media are making propaganda more
**persuasive**. This undermines our **epistemic security**]{.underline}
-- the ability to determine what is true and act on it -- [that
democracies depend on]{.underline}.

"Over the last few years, we\'ve seen the rise of filter bubbles and
people getting shunted by various algorithms into believing various
conspiracy theories, or even if they're not conspiracy theories, into
believing only parts of the truth," says Belfield. "[You can imagine
things getting **much worse**]{.underline}, especially [with deep fakes
and things like that, until it\'s increasingly harder for us
to]{.underline}, as a society, [decide these are the facts of the
matter]{.underline}, this is what we have to do about it, and then take
collective action."

**[2022]{.underline}** and beyond [is likely to see the traditional
engine of **political instability and conflict** return in **full force
worldwide**]{.underline}. No region, alliance, or grouping, shall remain
immune from the Great Power Bloc politics and ensuing pressures.

This time, perhaps [it shall be the **China-Russia axis** that shall
challenge the democratic]{.underline}, pluralist [order led by the West
along with **key partnerships in Asia**]{.underline}, [and nations that
orient or **align themselves with it**]{.underline}. Democracies will
severely be put to test.

The Test for India

[The above]{.underline} quandary, [most visible in the case of **India's
position on Russia**]{.underline}, was highlighted a few weeks back when
former Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga signaled understanding of New Delhi's
position. As per Suga, it would be in Japan's national interest, given
that "[India's current relationship with China is
**tense**]{.underline}. From that standpoint, [Russia is an extremely
important country for India]{.underline}... Considering the cold, harsh
reality of international politics, [it is crucial to keep **India in the
Quad**]{.underline}..."

[Tokyo and Delhi]{.underline}, apart from being two major Asian
democracies, also [happen to be the **linchpins of the Quad** in
Asia]{.underline}. Moreover, Japan and India have "...placed emphasis to
work in tandem towards a stable world, based on a rules-based order that
respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations..."

During the latest meeting between the prime ministers of Japan and India
in March 2022, the need for "seeking peaceful resolution of disputes in
accordance with international law without resorting to threat or use of
force or any attempt to unilaterally change status quo" was
unequivocally emphasized.

The Russia -- China Paradigm

Apparently, [Xi]{.underline} Jinping [and]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin
have spelled out the common position of China and Russia on how they
view democracy, development, **international security and
order**]{.underline}. While hosting Putin for the February 2022 summit
meeting, [Xi]{.underline} simultaneously [sent a tacit message to Japan
when he hosted Putin]{.underline} at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in
Beijing. [The venue's criticality lay in its name]{.underline} --
[referring]{.underline} to what Japan calls [the
**Senkaku**]{.underline} Gunto (**[Islands]{.underline}**).

Assessing the Taiwan Threat: [What if **China Strikes the Senkakus
First**?]{.underline}

[Relations between China and Japan have **increasingly been
strained**]{.underline} over the very bitterly contested territorial and
sovereignty row involving [these]{.underline} uninhabited
[islands]{.underline}.

[Xi]{.underline} noted the world entering a new phase of fluidity and
transformation. And he [expressed readiness to work with Putin to fully
leverage the political advantage of their ties and chart the course for
China-Russia relations under the new historical
circumstances.]{.underline}

Russia, on the other hand, described China as its most important
strategic partner and said that the China-Russia relationship symbolizes
21st century international relations.

Implications for the Free World

While Beijing and Moscow announce firm support for each other in
"defending their core interests, strengthening political and strategic
trust... and... in upholding sovereignty..." [it ends up creating a
**strategic binary for the world**]{.underline}.

More importantly, [the China-Russia axis will complicate multilateral
initiatives for many democratic nations as the former provide further
impetus to regional groupings]{.underline} led by them, including the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and BRICS.

[China]{.underline}, in all likelihood, [shall be **more perceptively
proactive**]{.underline} than simply sitting on the fence here. [Beijing
appears set to take charge in being the bigger player in this supposed
new alliance with Moscow that is **presenting itself in Eurasia** and
**expanding eastwards**]{.underline}.

[The **emergence of China** in the post-Ukraine conflict world will be a
seismic **shift that every major democratic player**]{.underline},
globally and regionally, [shall be challenged with for]{.underline}
strategic and **[realist reasons]{.underline}**.

[Choosing a path of **stability** and **de-escalation** has also allowed
India to nurture close relationships with **strategic
partners**]{.underline} in the developed world to help balance against
or contain Chinese power on a global level. The Quadrilateral Security
Dialogue, known commonly as "[the **Quad**]{.underline}," that [brings
**India together with the United States**]{.underline}, Australia, and
Japan (as well as possibly South Korea and Vietnam's role as part of the
so-called "Quad Plus") [is one of]{.underline} the main [ways in which
India tries to build such a diplomatic alliance. Coordinating with
countries that all share concerns]{.underline} over Chinese power
projection [may allow India to be part of a higher-level strategic
effort to **counterbalance against China**]{.underline}. Still, that
doesn't mean these burgeoning alliances will directly impact the
situation in Akai Chin.

The most critical manner in which [China has]{.underline} in fact
managed to [establish]{.underline} its undisputed [control over the
**Aksai Chin**]{.underline} region is evidenced by the evolution of
China's frontline positions. While initially composed of small outposts
and then joined by temporary tent camps during the 2020 face-off, these
positions have now evolved into permanent bases with cold weather
shelters.

[At the Depsang Plains]{.underline} for example, at the northern end of
the disputed Aksai Chin region, [China]{.underline} used to maintain an
observational presence. Today, this area [boasts a large military
position]{.underline} composed of infantry shelters and ammunition
storage facilities, as well as tanks and artillery systems. The Chinese
presence at the Depsang Plains evolved from a limited mission to a
permanent deployment of a large combat-capable force that would present
serious challenges for India to dislodge from its positions.

[At Galwan Valley and Hot Springs, Chinese troops were]{.underline} in
fact [forced to **withdraw**]{.underline} following skirmishes with
Indian troops and ensuing negotiations in 2020. Even at these locations
of the so-called "mutual withdrawals" just a single kilometer removed
from their initial positions, Chinese forces have established large
permanent bases supported by solar panels to provide them with energy
and modern roads to resupply them.

[China does maintain]{.underline} some rather rudimentary temporary
[positions in the Spanggur Lake]{.underline} area (just south of Pangong
Lake), but even these positions are directly supported by permanent
military positions that China developed at Pangong Lake and the even
larger military support positions deeper into China at Rutog.

China's ability to claim undisputed control over Aksai Chin is not based
solely on its ability to establish permanent military positions on the
border of the disputed territory. Perhaps even more important is the
vast network of large logistical nodes and support bases that China
established within the disputed region, and the tremendous effort it has
gone through to connect these and its frontline positions by building
new roads. Where China in the past maintained a logistics network that
could support the presence of several hundred Chinese troops on the
frontlines of its territorial claims in Aksai Chin, this upgraded
infrastructure and support network now allows it to reinforce many
thousands of troops simultaneously.

This effort may seem easier than it really is, but in order to
effectively connect all these positions and support bases to China's
existing military lines of communication, it has had to effectively tame
the geography of Aksai Chin.

This means, for example, taming the riverbed in the many valleys between
mountain ranges, to guarantee year-round mobility even when the rivers
are in spate. By constructing this brand new road network, interspaced
with large arterial support bases behind the frontline, China
effectively turned what used to be a long five-hour journey into just a
one or two-hour trip.

China has also not limited its logistical expansion into Aksai Chin to
ground transport and has expanded its logistics into the third dimension
by constructing a number of large heliports inside and nearby Aksai
Chin. Prior to the 2020 crisis, small Chinese observation posts would
sometimes have a small helipad nearby, but the new disposition includes
the permanent deployment of entire helicopter squadrons at key
logistical nodes to facilitate the rapid movement of troops or supplies
when needed. The redevelopment and expansion of airpower on China's
western border is not only limited to Aksai Chin, the pattern has been
observed across the Tibetan Plateau indicative of a larger vertical lift
network that is rapidly taking shape. You can read all about this
reality and our analysis of it in past features linked here and here.

The expansion of China's forward deployments and logistical support even
expands beyond the Aksai Chin region itself. Since the beginning of the
2020 crisis, China has erected veritable military cities from the empty
desert. These immense bases directly support China's ability to maintain
troop presence within Aksai Chin, and offer it the ability to rapidly
surge its military presence in the area during future crises.

At Pangong Lake, for example, new roads -- and a bridge across the lake
just outside of India's territorial claim -- reach all the way around
the lake to the town of Rutog where large military facilities now
dominate the landscape.

These facilities provide for a permanent deployment of Chinese forces,
as well as frequent rotations of training exercises that allow Chinese
military units to even better prepare for potential conflict in this
region and especially at extreme altitudes that are a staple of it. The
same is true for other regions, where in the North, the logistical
connections draw all the way to China's Hotan Air Base, and in the
south, Chinese forward positions at Demchok are supported by connections
to military facilities in Gar County and the Ngari Gunsa air bases.

Vikram J. Singh, Senior Advisor for Asia at the US Institute For Peace,
says enhancing India's situational awareness and deterrent posture will
be critical to maintaining stability.

"In Aksai Chin, China has largely replicated its success of gaining de
facto control of disputed territory in the waters of the South China
Sea," Singh says. "[Getting the best intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance capabilities possible and investing in its military to
**deter further Chinese provocations is vital**]{.underline}."

"[Beijing's success with **coercion**]{.underline} [and
**militarisation**]{.underline} [of disputed territory]{.underline}
below the threshold of conflict [can easily lead to
**miscalculation**]{.underline} [about what will provoke a **forceful
response**]{.underline} from a neighbor and risk escalation."

As [India]{.underline} turns to self-reliance, Singh says, it [should
leverage its \"**willing partners**, the United States]{.underline}, as
well as Europe and Israel, [can provide technology India needs right now
to stay on **top of the challenge**]{.underline} from China and
contribute to self-sufficiency."

[The intensity of China's military buildup in and around Aksai
Chin,]{.underline} which has continued effortlessly after the limited
withdrawals in 2020, [effectively puts it in a position where its
ability to project military power into the disputed region is relatively
**uncontestable**]{.underline}. Negotiations have not led to any
breakthroughs for India to improve its position or access within the
disputed territory.

In essence, [time has been on China's side and India now faces
a]{.underline} (quite literal) **[uphill battle]{.underline}** to
restore even a semblance of control over its territorial claims in this
area while it simultaneously faces similar challenges at other locations
of its shared border farther East.

#### Clashes escalate to [nuclear use]{.underline}. Ukraine makes it likelier.

[Rising Risks for **Nuclear Conflict**]{.underline}

The British Empire's withdrawal from the Indian subcontinent in 1947
left unresolved issues of statehood and borders --- and the Himalayan
frontiers of [China, India and Pakistan]{.underline} have since formed a
persistent, unhealed wound. The three nations [have clashed in **dozens
of confrontations**]{.underline}, from full-scale, conventional wars to
Himalayan border skirmishes and armed standoffs, terrorist attacks or
air strikes. [India-Pakistan conflicts have **escalated** since
Pakistani terrorists attacked Mumbai in 2008,]{.underline} killing or
injuring hundreds of Indians. [The India-China border conflict has
**flared since 2020**, including its worst violence in 45
years.]{.underline}

The [risks of **sudden violence**]{.underline} in the region were
dramatized in March when [India's military **accidentally
launched**]{.underline} [a]{.underline}n unarmed, **[supersonic
missile]{.underline}** 75 miles [into Pakistan]{.underline}. Luckily,
the missile's crash killed no one, and it came in a moment of relative
calm in the two countries' volatile relations. [Less noticed outside the
region is China's and India's continued buildup of **military
infrastructure**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[capabilities]{.underline}** [along their disputed border, including a
recent shift of Indian troops]{.underline} to to that zone.

While the rivalries, [periodic clashes and armed capacity of the three
nations have sharpened]{.underline} over 15 years, [policies to protect
strategic stability "**didn't really move** along with the
changes]{.underline}," said Vikram Singh, an Asia security policy
specialist at USIP. Fundamentally, "[there is an **absolute lack of
strategic engagement** among the three powers about **how they would
manage escalation**," and rising uncertainty about "**how crises might
spiral**,"]{.underline} he said. "I think [what we've seen in Russia and
Ukraine gives us reason to think **hard**]{.underline} about the
unthinkable." Singh spoke at USIP alongside others among 19 Asia and
nuclear security specialists who conducted the study, published this
week. The report analyzes recent years' evolution of the conflicts and
offers recommendations for U.S. policymakers.

"[We see an evolution, both in terms of the
**capabilities**]{.underline}" of the rival states, notably "more and
different types of weapons of technology," [and perhaps more
importantly, in **deteriorating relationships**]{.underline},
"particularly between India and China, and India and Pakistan," said
Daniel Markey, a scholar and policy practitioner on South Asia and USIP
advisor. [These]{.underline} evolutions [lead "to possibilities
for]{.underline} even the potential of **[nuclear use]{.underline}** in
the region that are very worrisome," he said.

Analysts from the USIP-convened Senior Study Group on Strategic
Stability in Southern Asia discussed specific evolutions that are
increasing the risks. One is that [China is significantly expanding its
**nuclear arsenal**]{.underline}, which is expected to reach "up to 700
deployed warheads within the next five years," said Lynn Rusten, who
leads efforts to reduce the dangers of nuclear weapons at the
nonpartisan Nuclear Threat Initiative. Another problem is [that the
return to power of Afghanistan's Taliban creates new space for **violent
extremist groups** bent on **attacking India** through Pakistan.
Such]{.underline} attacks [have been a]{.underline} frequent [trigger
for **India-Pakistan military clashes**]{.underline}.

[Southern Asia has gradually become a **theater of rival alliances** ---
between the **United States and India** on one hand and **China and
Pakistan** on the other, a polarization that has been accelerated by the
**global strategic rivalry**]{.underline} between China and the United
States, noted Yun Sun, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at the
Stimson Center. While both countries have sought to calm previous
eruptions of violent conflict between India and Pakistan,
[the]{.underline} increasingly [pronounced alignments of the United
States and China now will make it **more difficult for them to play a
mediating role**]{.underline} in future crises, Sun and other analysts
said.

The 'Ukraine Effect'

The study group expressed concern that [China, India and Pakistan all
**underestimate the risks**]{.underline} that [a next flareup in any of
their conflicts could **escalate out of control**]{.underline}, whether
[by **miscalculation** or **accident**]{.underline}, Singh said. "Across
all three there is a level of comfort ... that this isn't going to be a
major problem," he said. Sun and Andrew Scobell, a specialist on Chinese
foreign relations at USIP, echoed the concern, and Scobell said [Beijing
could deepen that **false sense of comfort** if]{.underline} the
[Ukraine]{.underline} war [avoids]{.underline} a [nuclear
escalation]{.underline} following public alarm about that risk.

While some commentators have suggested that Russia's setbacks in the
Ukraine war will largely indicate caution to China over any military
effort to seize control over Taiwan, study group members said it remains
unclear what lessons China will absorb about the various conflicts along
its periphery. "I'd be wary of thinking that they're drawing the lessons
... we hope they're drawing," said Scobell. "The Chinese conclusion is
likely that they \[Russia\] didn't prepare properly, and we're going to
prepare properly" for any strike on Taiwan, he said.

In southern Asia, the [Ukraine]{.underline} conflict [is likely to
**disadvantage India**]{.underline} by [**weakening Russia** as a
reliable supplier of the vast majority of Indian weapons --- from
**tanks** to **missiles** to **submarines**]{.underline}, Singh and Sun
said. Singh asked whether such a tilting of [the military balance might
help prompt Beijing to consider **pushing "a little harder**" in the
countries' border dispute --- and what the **response of an uncertain
India might be**]{.underline}.

Rules-based order

Under President Xi Jinping, China's most powerful leader since Mao
Zedong, [Beijing has become **more nationalistic**]{.underline} [and
**assertive**. It has cracked down on **pro-democracy
protesters**]{.underline} in semi-autonomous Hong Kong, [interned more
than one million Muslims in the far western region of Xinjiang and
stepped up **threats of military force** to seize]{.underline} the
self-ruled island of [Taiwan]{.underline}.

[It is also rapidly **modernising its defence forces**]{.underline} and
**[increasing its military presence]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline}
disputed waters of the [S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea [and the E]{.underline}ast [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea.

This April, with the world distracted by the coronavirus pandemic, a
Chinese Coast Guard vessel rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing boat
close to the Paracel islands in the South China Sea. Later, a standoff
between a Malaysian oil exploration vessel and a Chinese survey vessel,
off Malaysia's Borneo, prompted the US and Australia to deploy warships
to the area.

[The Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan all lay
claim]{.underline} to parts of the energy-rich waters, [but
Beijing]{.underline}, which claims almost the entire area under its
decades-old "nine-dash line", [has been **extending its reach** by
building military bases on reefs and rocky outcrops.]{.underline}

A United Nations tribunal ruled in 2016 that China's "historical rights"
had no basis in the law.

[On China's Himalayan frontier with India, long-simmering tensions
**boiled** over]{.underline} in June, with troops from both sides
fighting each other with clubs and stones in the Galwan Valley. The
clashes left 20 Indian soldiers dead and was the first fatal
confrontation between the two sides since 1975.

[Friction]{.underline} also [increased in the E]{.underline}ast
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, [where China has a **territorial
dispute with Japan**, with the US accusing Beijing in July of
"**unprecedented**" military incursions]{.underline} into the disputed
waters.

"[The Quad comes about as an effort to try to deter China's ability to
challenge and disrupt the **rules-based order**]{.underline} and the
status quo in the Indo-Pacific region," said Lemahieu. "[It's a
signalling on the part of these four democracies that they are and they
would get even **more serious about acting as a military**]{.underline}
and strategic counterweight to China, [if Beijing were to continue to
challenge]{.underline} \[the status quo\], [not just in the
S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea [but also in
the Indian Ocean."]{.underline}

What also worries the four countries, Lemahieu said, is China's
willingness to exploit "economic interdependencies to try to level
informal sanctions" to punish countries that oppose it.

For instance, this year, Beijing slapped trade sanctions on Australia,
after Canberra backed an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus. It
suspended some beef imports on a technicality and effectively blocked
barley imports by imposing huge tariffs on the Australian grain.
Australian traders are now expecting more sanctions on exports of
Australian wine, timber and even lobsters.

[Moscow]{.underline}, however, [is]{.underline} also [motivated by
**practical considerations**]{.underline}. As a Pacific power, [it is
concerned about]{.underline} the [U.S. military buildup]{.underline} in
the region. The United States' sale of more than 100 fifth-generation
F-35 stealth fighters to Japan last summer prompted Russia to strengthen
its air defense grouping in the Far Eastern islands, deploying S-400s
and S-300V4s in addition to short-range anti-aircraft missile systems
and extending Russia's power projection capabilities. Reports that the
Biden administration could seek to deploy ground-based intermediate
range missiles in Japan were met a stern warning from Minister Lavrov
that Russia would "retaliate." Moscow views the U.S.-led Quad security
arrangement the way it sees NATO---as an instrument of American hegemony
veiled as multilateralism.

But [Moscow's response may also be a by-product of U.S. **inattention to
Russia** as an equal global partner as Washington **concentrates its
geostrategic focus on the Indo-Pacific**]{.underline} and describes
Russia as "also a threat, but in decline." This message is further
reinforced in the Biden administration's interim U.S. National Security
Strategy, which emphasizes China almost to the exclusion of Russia. As
the United States and its allies increase their military posture in the
Indo-Pacific, [Russia's defense cooperation with Beijing will **grow**
because **China**, more so than any other Asian power, **enhances
Russia's standing globally**]{.underline}, and in the Indo-Pacific
region to a lesser extent. [Moscow will subordinate its relations with
other regional powers]{.underline}, such as India and Vietnam, [to its
strategic partnership with Beijing. Russia's goal will not be **to
engage the United States directly**]{.underline} or contribute direct
military support to China, [but rather to **extend the geographical
scope of contestation**]{.underline} in order [to **dilute U.S.
power**]{.underline} in the region and demonstrate its own value to
China as a strategic partner.

What can be done to avoid this strategic conundrum?

[Though the Russian and Chinese economies are highly
compatible]{.underline}---China requires energy, food and diverse
shipping routes for its exports, which Russia provides in the form of
oil, liquified natural gas, wheat, and the Arctic-based Northern Sea
Route---[their economic disparities are **great**]{.underline}, and
their [economic relations are negotiated on **China's
terms**]{.underline}, not Russia's. Russian arms sales to China have
increased, but China's indigenous military technological capabilities
are catching up to and in some areas, such as artificial intelligence,
shipbuilding, and stealth aircraft, surpassing Russia's. This carries
security as well as business implications, since Russia will likely sell
fewer weapons to China. Perhaps more worrisome to Russia is its long,
sparsely populated border with China, which for Moscow remains a natural
security concern.

Russia is fully aware of this asymmetry but can do little to
counterbalance it other than to seek engagement with other Pacific
powers such as India, Japan, and the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations to enhance its own standing in the region and preserve room for
maneuver. However, Moscow finds itself in a catch-22: the closer it
positions itself with China, the further it will alienate itself from
its historic relationship with Delhi in particular, as well as with
Tokyo. This dilemma was a point of interest in recent Track 2 dialogues
held by CSIS and a Russian and Japanese partner organization, but
participants sensed little movement on Moscow's end to resolve it.
Further second track work between the United States, Russia, and India
focused on ways of preserving regional optionality may be warranted.

Despite great tensions in their bilateral relationship, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Russia could identify
some]{.underline} narrow [areas of **compatible long-term visions for
the Indo-Pacific**]{.underline} region. [Both aim to establish a
multipolar regional order in which China is a driver of positive sum
economic growth but **not a regional hegemon**. With troubling signs
that China's ultimate goal is unipolarity, Moscow may seek **strategic
rebalancing**]{.underline} while continuing to view the Quad
skeptically. Russia and China have no military obligations to each
other, but [a crisis in the region would put pressure on Russia to
**align with China rhetorically**]{.underline}, thereby reducing the
political space for Moscow to counterbalance its relations with other
states. [Preservation of Russia's economic and security relationship
with India may offer opportunity in an effort to avoid **expediting
Moscow's military alignment with Beijing**]{.underline}, which remains
in the interest of the United States.

### RCA Impact\-\--Blackmail\-\--2NC 

#### The RCA [breaks]{.underline} MAD with [nuclear coercion]{.underline}. Extinction. 

Fatma **Khaled 22**, Staff Reporter, 6-18-22, "Ex-Generals See Nuclear
Blackmail \'Trinity\' in Russia, China, North Korea,"
<https://www.newsweek.com/ex-generals-see-nuclear-blackmail-trinity-russia-china-north-korea-1717147>,
jy

Former U.S. generals said Saturday that they see [a **nuclear
blackmail** \"trinity\" in Russia, China, and North Korea]{.underline},
adding that the United States must now \"seriously\" consider how it
would counter one.

\"[The most significant of **all the problem sets**]{.underline} [may be
the emergence of a new norm in nuclear doctrine---blackmail. That
approach is in **stark contrast** to the notion of Mutually Assured
Destruction]{.underline}, where major powers---United States, the USSR,
and China---viewed atomic attack as truly a last resort,\" retired Air
Force Major General Howard Thompson and former Lieutenant General Dan
Leaf wrote in a report published by Real Clear Defense.

The report by the former generals comes in the wake of China and Russia
vetoing sanctions against North Korea last month for the first time
since October 2006, according to CNN, despite a series of North Korean
ballistic missile tests that were launched during the first half of this
year.

\"This first-ever [rejection of sanctions marks the emergence of an
unholy trinity implicitly willing to hold the world order at risk
by]{.underline} threatening, and perhaps [executing, limited **nuclear
attack**]{.underline},\" the former generals said.

This was not the case in October 2006 when the United Nations Security
Council, including China and Russia, were fast in condemning and passing
sanctions against North Korea after the country launched its first
nuclear test, according to the report. The two countries haven\'t
blocked any of the nine previous sanction votes that were passed since
that year.

\"The [vetoes today are **dangerous**]{.underline}. Those
[members]{.underline} today [have taken a stance that]{.underline} not
only [undermines the **Security Counci**]{.underline}l\'s previous
action to which they have committed [but also]{.underline} undermines
our **[collective security]{.underline}**,\" U.S. ambassador to the U.N.
Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement last month that was made on
behalf of the U.S., Japan, and South Korea.

[Some experts previously said that **North Korea\'s**]{.underline}
fast-paced [missile launches earlier this year were meant to
pressure]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline} administration to
reconsider U.S. sanctions against the country.

In their report, Howard and Leaf referenced a Financial Times article
that was published in April with national security analyst at Harvard
University, Graham [Allison]{.underline}, that [pointed out that there
is \"every reason to believe\" that]{.underline} Russian President
Vladimir [Putin would choose to \"**escalate the level of
destruction**\"]{.underline} instead of accepting a loss in Ukraine, if
he had to pick between the two.

\"[Putin]{.underline} first [explicitly raised the **nuclear
option**]{.underline} to deter outside intervention, and since h[as
hinted of the use of t]{.underline}actical [n]{.underline}uclear
[w]{.underline}eapon[s]{.underline} [to]{.underline} force capitulation
or **[punish]{.underline}** intervention from or expansion of the
**[NATO]{.underline}** alliance,\" the former generals said in their
report.

Meanwhile, Howard and Leaf didn\'t rule out the possibility of China
using a nuclear option as Beijing\'s tension with Taiwan continues. The
Chinese government repeatedly pointed out that it\'s not hesitant to use
military force to reclaim the independent island.

\"[Xi has left no doubt about his willingness to resort]{.underline} [to
a]{.underline} **[military option to reclaim Taiwan]{.underline}**, and
[it would be naïve to expect the Chinese to refrain from **nuclear
coercion**]{.underline} in such circumstances. [With **Russian backing
for a move**]{.underline} [against Taiwan or aggression in the volatile
S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, [the potential
for **nuclear coercion is exceedingly high**,\" they
explained.]{.underline}

Volatile Security

[Security]{.underline} \"in and around\" cyberspace [will likely
**remain volatile**]{.underline} for the years to come, [given the
**conflicting strategic national interests** and the **diverging
cultural and ideological approaches** at play.]{.underline} [The
confrontation between the **West on the one hand**]{.underline}, [and
**Russia**]{.underline}, North Korea, [**China** and Iran **on the
other**, will most likely impact international stability in profound
ways. It will most likely trigger **sharp escalations of
hostilities**]{.underline} in the conventional domain, the [adoption of
international counter-measures in response to cyber
campaign]{.underline}s26, [and the application of conflicting
operational standards concerning the Internet development.]{.underline}
Technological [developments]{.underline} in the fields [of
A]{.underline}rtificial [I]{.underline}ntelligence, [the
Internet]{.underline} of Things, [robotics and quantum
computing]{.underline} (to name just a few) [will]{.underline} most
likely [consolidate]{.underline} the current [trends, and the
international community **will drift**]{.underline} --- as explained in
detail by Professor Umberto Gori in his chapter of this Report ---
[towards a Balance of Power that is **much more difficult to assess and
to maintain**]{.underline} 27.

[In this scenario of **ambiguity** and **uncertainty**, every state is
actively engaged in attaining \"**cyber superiority**]{.underline}\",
defined as the \"degree of dominance in cyberspace by one force that
permits the secure, reliable conduct of operations by that force, and
its related land, air, maritime, and space forces at a given time and
place without prohibitive interference by an adversary\"28. Cyber
superiority is key in enhancing situational awareness and attribution,
allowing countries under attack to impose swift, costly and transparent
consequences in response to malicious behaviour29. Cyber [superiority
is]{.underline} also **[vital]{.underline}** [in mapping the the-atre of
future conflicts, in anticipating the adversary\'s
**vulnerabilities**]{.underline} and [in contesting its **courses of
action**]{.underline}, and in establishing the deterrence posture -
which is particularly complex to establish in cyberspace, as actionable
attribution, and therefore retaliation, are troublesome30. If the new US
(and, hopefully, Western) posture will succeed in enhancing
predictability in cyberspace, the international community might then be
facilitated in agreeing on constraining rules of behaviour, and in
enhancing international cooperation against non-state malicious actors.

The problem with these [developments]{.underline} is that the national
legitimate quests for cyber superiority [translate]{.underline}, at the
international level, [in a **massive security paradox**]{.underline}
(\"my security is your insecurity\") [that undermines]{.underline} trust
within the international community [and **threatens international
stability**]{.underline}. In fact, one of the main features of
cyberspace is the fact that [offensive and defensive]{.underline}
[capabilities develop \"**hand in hand**\": it is impossible to ensure
the appropriate defence of national ICT networks without knowing how an
attack is executed]{.underline} and without developing a certain degree
of cyber superiority. Moreover, [cyber incidents typically do **not
allow time to react**]{.underline}, and therefore mapping the
battlefield before full-scale hostilities erupt is an operational
imperative. This implies conducting intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance (ISR) operations against the networks of potential
enemies - operations that, in turn, may easily be perceived as military
in character. [Signaling about offensive capabilities]{.underline},
also, se[rves also the purpose of deterring potential enemies by
clarifying the readiness to respond \"in kind\" to an
attack]{.underline}31. How else to read, for instance, the malwares that
have been found in critical infrastructures around the world, other than
weapons designed and planted to indicate readiness to strike in case of
full-scale hostilities? Finally, cyber weapons are inherently secret, as
they rely on ICT vulnerabilities (zero-days) to be effective; as such,
visibility on each other cyber arsenals is virtually impossible, an
armament control regime is unsustainable, and [the security paradox
becomes **more relevant everyday**]{.underline}.

A GROWING COALITION

[Russia]{.underline}'s unilateral [initiatives to **escape the hold of
the dollar**]{.underline} may be defensive in nature, but it [has also
worked with **other countries**]{.underline} to chip away at the
dollar's dominance. These [coalitions present a long-term threat to the
**dollar's preeminent role**]{.underline} in international commerce and,
consequently, a challenge to U.S. global leadership. [The]{.underline}
shared [desire to reduce dependence on the dollar has strengthened the
relationship between Russia and China]{.underline}. Bilateral [currency
swaps]{.underline} between the two central banks [helped Russia **bypass
U.S. sanctions**]{.underline} in 2014 and facilitate bilateral trade and
investment. In 2016, Prime Minister Dmitry [Medvedev called for
harmonizing the two countries' national payment systems]{.underline} and
discussed the prospect of launching a new Russia-China cross-border
payment system for direct settlements in yuan and rubles. In 2018, Putin
stated that [Russia and China "confirmed their interest in using
national currencies more actively]{.underline} in reciprocal payments."

In 2019, China upgraded its ties with Russia to a "comprehensive
strategic partnership of coordination for a new era," the highest level
of China's bilateral relations. Thereafter, Russia's central bank
invested \$44 billion in yuan, increasing its share in Russia's foreign
exchange reserves from five to 15 percent in early 2019. Russia's yuan
holdings are about ten times the global average and account for nearly a
quarter of global yuan reserves. In 2019, China and Russia signed a
treaty that increases the use of their respective national currencies in
cross-border trade to 50 percent. In 2021, Russian Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov urged China to work with Russia to reduce their dependence
on the U.S. dollar and Western payment systems. The Russian government
allowed Russia's sovereign wealth fund to invest in yuan reserves and
Chinese state bonds. [Chinese policymakers hope that partnership with
Russia will help broaden a **yuan-based financial infrastructure**,
including a Chinese rival to SWIFT]{.underline} and a rival bank card
payment system, [thereby boosting the yuan's status]{.underline} as a
reserve currency and bolstering China's financial autonomy.

[Putin seeks to expand such alternative financial infrastructure through
**Russia's dealings with other countries**]{.underline}. In 2019, Iran
and Russia connected their financial messaging systems, thereby
bypassing SWIFT by allowing banks in both countries to send cross-border
transaction messages. Russia and Turkey have discussed using the ruble
and the Turkish lira in cross-border trade. [Russia introduced its
version of SWIFT to banks in the Eurasian Economic Union]{.underline} (a
partnership of five post-Soviet states) [and expressed interest in
**expanding it to countries in the Arab world and Europe**. Russia has
tried to muster further support for de-dollarization in multilateral
forums such as the **BRICS**]{.underline} grouping, which consists of
Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South Africa, and the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization. BRICS' New Development Bank has raised funds
in local currencies as part of its goal to "break away from the tyranny
of hard currencies." In 2020, SCO members underscored the importance of
using national currencies in trade among one another and discussed the
establishment of a development bank and development fund. Russia and
[China can use these forums to create a broad de-dollarization coalition
with the promise of greater financial autonomy for all and reduced
dependence on the dollar.]{.underline}

HOW WOULD THE WORLD AND GLOBAL TRADE BE AFFECTED BY AN ABANDONMENT OF
THE DOLLAR?

[If the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates---[and]{.underline}
presumably the [other Anglophone economies]{.underline}---were to [take
steps that eliminated the role of their domestic financial
markets]{.underline} as the net absorbers of foreign savings, by
definition [they would also no longer run current account and trade
deficits]{.underline}. But because [these countries account for 70--75
percent of the world's **current account deficits**]{.underline} (with
the developing world accounting for most of the rest), [this
would]{.underline} also [mean that,]{.underline} unless some other large
economy proves willing to convert its surpluses into massive deficits,
[the world would have to reduce its collective trade **surpluses by
70--75 percent**]{.underline}.

To understand the implications, let's assume a country that runs
persistent trade surpluses is forced to adapt to a world of much lower
trade deficits, and hence of much lower trade surpluses. As I have
explained elsewhere (here, here, and here, for example), in [countries
that run persistent surpluses, domestic savings must **exceed domestic
investment**. Domestic savings are high]{.underline}, in turn, mainly
[because ordinary households]{.underline}, who consume most of their
income, [receive a very low share of the GDP they
produce]{.underline}---compared to shares of businesses, the government,
and the very rich.

[Countries that run persistent surpluses]{.underline}, in other words,
[do so because deficiencies in domestic demand caused by **distortions
in the distribution of income** make them incapable of **absorbing all
they produce domestically**]{.underline}. To put it in another way,
[these distortions force up their savings rates above their investment
rates]{.underline}. This means that, if [an **external
event**]{.underline} [were to force a **sharp contraction**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} a country's [trade and current account
surpluses]{.underline}, there are broadly speaking five ways (or some
combination thereof) by which [its economy could **adjust**]{.underline}
to bring savings and investment back in line.

- [A **surge in unemployment**]{.underline}: Such a country's [savings
  would decline if a collapse in its exports caused manufacturing
  **unemployment to surge**. Unemployed workers]{.underline}, of course,
  [have negative savings]{.underline}.

- A boost in consumer lending to spur domestic demand: The country's
  savings would decline if the central bank, in response to a collapse
  in exports, quickly forced banks to increase consumer lending
  dramatically so as to replace foreign demand with domestic demand.
  Even if it were possible to do this efficiently, [**rising household
  debt** would eventually be unsustainable.]{.underline}

- A jump in government deficit spending to spur demand: Savings would
  decline if the country's government, in response to a collapse in
  exports, quickly expanded the fiscal deficit so as to replace foreign
  demand with domestic demand. Even if it were possible to do this
  efficiently, [**rising fiscal deficits** would eventually be
  unsustainable]{.underline}.

- Income redistribution: The country's savings would decline if the
  government were able to engineer a substantial redistribution of
  income to ordinary households. This would be sustainable and by far
  the best long-term outcome for both the country and the world, but
  [any substantial redistribution of income would be a **slow and
  difficult process**]{.underline}, and it would almost [certainly be
  **politically disruptive**]{.underline}, as is clearly the case, for
  example, in China.

- A surge of investment: The country's government could engineer a
  massive increase in investment. The private sector is unlikely to
  respond to a collapse in exports by increasing investment, and indeed
  private firms would probably reduce investment, so the increase in
  government investment would have to be enough to absorb both the
  contraction in the trade surplus and any reduction in business
  investment. This is what China did, for example, in 2009--2010.

There are only a limited number of ways in which a country that runs
persistent surpluses can adjust to a global contraction in aggregate
trade deficits, all of which are very difficult. This just reinforces
how [it is the willingness and ability of the United States to run
large, persistent deficits that **underpins the role of the dollar as
the world's dominant currency**]{.underline}, and how [it is these
deficits that **most benefit**]{.underline}, directly or indirectly,
[the countries that claim to be most eager to dethrone the U.S. dollar.
These are also the countries---**especially China**---who claim to be
most keen to have their currencies **replace the U.S.
dollar**]{.underline} even as their domestic economic policies make this
impossible.

around 170,000 soldiers to [[occupy Manchuria]{.underline}]{.mark}.
These moves backfired spectacularly: They antagonized Japan, which beat
Russia in the first great-power war of the 20th century.

An erosion of the public's capacity to impose democratic constraint has
a similar impact on the audience cost arguments and, more broadly, on
our understandings of democratic credibility and conflict reciprocation.
International relations scholars generally agree that leaders usually
feel some pressure to actually carry out the threats and promises that
they make in the international system. This might be because they care
about their reputation with other leaders, but the usual argument is
that democracies are more likely than autocracies to follow through on
threats because they have domestic audiences who will hold them to
account if they fail to do so (Fearon 1994; Schultz 2001). Polarization
undermines that linkage, thereby potentially undermining the democratic
advantage in foreign crisis negotiations and, ultimately, making war
more likely. [**The [tribal]{.mark} element** of **polarized
[politics]{.mark}** [means]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[followers are
**unlikely**]{.mark} to [hold]{.mark} their [leader to account.
Opposition]{.mark}]{.underline}, in turn, [is [**unlikely** to give
the]{.mark} president **any [credit regardless]{.mark} of the
policy**]{.underline}. Thus, while traditional versions of audience cost
theory assumed that in democracies domestic audiences would judge a
vacillating leader harshly, such [accountability is **less
likely**]{.underline} to emerge [in **a polarized
environment**]{.underline}.3 In this respect, [polarization]{.underline}
thus [causes democratic leaders to **more closely resemble** their
autocratic counterparts]{.underline}.

As we have noted, even in the information environment that preceded
cable, satellite, and the Internet, the public had a low baseline of
attentiveness. But voters were able to use heuristics to help them
determine both when to engage with foreign policy issues and what to
think about them when they did (Popkin 1991; Sniderman et al. 1991).
This was accomplished primarily through reliance on partisan elites
(Iyengar and Kinder 1987; Krosnick and Kinder 1990). However,
[**[opposition and disaffected]{.mark} copartisans** [have
**no**]{.mark} **meaningful [access]{.mark}** [to the public in **a
polarized**]{.mark} **and fragmented [media]{.mark} ecosystem**. Elite
[whistle-blowing will **only inhibit**]{.mark} [leaders
when]{.mark}]{.underline} there is a credible threat that [[the public
will hear **the whistle**]{.mark} **being blown**]{.underline}, but the
audience cost mechanism relies on precisely this hand-tying process. If
it breaks down there is no reason for democratically elected leaders to
fear punishment for backing down on their threats and commitments and
therefore no boost to their credibility when they make commitments.

[**The [polarized]{.mark}** and **[fragmental info]{.mark}rmation
environment**]{.underline} also [[has]{.mark} [**corrosive effects**
on]{.mark} **the [rally-round-the-flag]{.mark}
phenomenon**]{.underline}, at least with regard to how it has been
widely understood to date. Since approval rallies for presidents
following uses of force abroad were traditionally located primarily
among opposition partisans, partisan tribalism seems likely to result in
smaller and less frequent rallies. For instance, when President Obama
drew a "red line" with Syria over President Assad's use of chemical
weapons against civilians, he faced widespread criticism from
Republicans in Congress and low marks from the public over his handling
of the crisis. At the same time, public support for intervening in Syria
remained low, arguably complicating Obama's efforts to credibly
communicate America's resolve to Assad.

That said, while we may observe smaller and less frequent spikes in
presidential approval ratings as a consequence of heightened
polarization, [**a different sort of rally effect** may become **more
common**]{.underline}. That is, [**the [intensity of support]{.mark}
for** [and **opposition**]{.mark} **to** the president [might
spike]{.mark}]{.underline} among his supporters or opponents
[[in]{.mark} **the immediate aftermath of [a crisis]{.mark}
event**]{.underline}. A case in point is President Trump's recent
sounding of the alarm over a Central American migrant caravan during the
run-up to the 2018 midterm election. Notwithstanding the assertions of
many pundits, there is little evidence that President Trump succeeded in
increasing overall support for Republicans by characterizing the migrant
caravan as an invasion. Trump first tweeted about the caravan on October
18, 2018. According to data on fivethirtyeight.com, Democrats led
Republicans by 8.4 percentage points in the generic ballot during
October 1--18. The Democratic lead from October 19 through election day
was 8.3 points, or basically unchanged. Indeed, one postelection
analysis (Winston Group 2018) concluded that late-deciding voters broke
toward the Democrats by 12 points and cited the emphasis on the migrant
caravan, which crowded out good news on the economy, as a key causal
factor. However, among Republicans, concern over illegal immigration
measurably increased with Trump's caravan-related tweets. It is entirely
possible, albeit uncertain, that Republican turnout in some states
consequently rose, thereby improving the performance of Republican
candidates in close elections, such as the Senate race in Florida and
the gubernatorial race in Georgia. Since Democrats were already at
historic levels of intensity leading up to the election, such a spike
could have produced a net benefit for Republican candidates. The
implication is that [[**prior concerns** about "diversionary" conflict
were **overblown**]{.mark} because]{.underline} the types of
[conflicts]{.underline} that a leader might initiate for such a purpose
were precisely those most likely to collapse the elasticity of reality
(**[mak]{.underline}**ing [the risk greater than the potential
reward]{.underline}). However, [[in **a**]{.mark} **highly [polarized
environment]{.mark}**]{.underline} where the electoral battle is more
about mobilizing supporters than convincing the undecided [[there may
be]{.mark} **much [more incentive]{.mark}** for leaders [to engage
in]{.mark}]{.underline} this potentially **[[destructive
behavior]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Abstract

We argue that the growth rate, but not the level of aggregate income,
affects the support for extreme political parties. In our model, extreme
parties offer short-run benefits to part of the population at the
expense of a minority. Growth effects on the support for such parties
arise when uncertainty exists over whether the same subset of
individuals will receive the same benefits in the future. [**More
people** are willing to take **political risks** if]{.underline}
economic [growth is slow]{.underline}. Based on a panel of 16 European
countries, our [empirical analysis shows]{.underline} that
**[[slow]{.mark}er [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}** rates are associated
with a significant [[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} in **[right-wing
[extremism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We find no significant effect of
economic growth on the support for extreme left-wing parties.

1 Introduction

Distributional consequences are associated with political extremism,
both in the short run and in the long run. Extreme political parties
often propose to redistribute resources away from specific subgroups of
society, such as the rich, ethnic minorities, or citizens living in
specific regions. This paper analyzes the impact of economic growth on
the support for extreme political parties in western democracies. We
argue that the growth rate, but not the level of aggregate income,
affects the support for extremism.

In the first part of our paper, we discuss three alternative
explanations for why an increase in the economic growth rate reduces the
support for extreme political parties. Two well-known explanations are
related to retrospective voting and behavioral effects, the latter
meaning that voters may react more strongly to changes in than to levels
of economic well-being. The third, novel explanation is that parties
with extreme political platforms are perceived to create considerable
uncertainty about the future distribution of income.

[We develop **a simple game-theoretic model** that analyzes]{.underline}
that [uncertainty]{.underline} effect. In our model, [extreme political
parties offer **short-run gains** from redistribution to a
group]{.underline} of individuals. [However, the same
individuals]{.underline} also [face **long-run losses**]{.underline}
owing [to the]{.underline} higher [income risk]{.underline} that is
[associated with an extreme regime]{.underline}.1 The model permits a
comparative static analysis with respect to several key variables of
interest. The [growth]{.underline} rate [is associated with **larger
future income risk**]{.underline}. Such [risk reduces the number of
voters favoring extreme parties]{.underline}. The level of aggregate
income has no effect on the support for extremism. Income inequality
raises support for redistribution and affects the impact that a change
in the growth rate has on the support for extremism.

An important feature of our model is that the effect of economic growth
on the support for extremism depends on uncertainty of future income
redistribution. If redistributive policies are perceived as
predictable---in the sense that the same group will have income taken
away from it in the future---then the political support for an extremist
party is unaffected by growth.

In the empirical part of our paper, we estimate the relationship between
economic growth and the support for extreme political parties using a
**[panel [data]{.mark}]{.underline}**set
compris[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}g **[[16]{.mark} European
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Our dependent variable is a
survey-based measure, compiled by Euro-barometer, of respondents\'
support for extreme right-wing parties and extreme left-wing parties. We
use that data, [[which spans]{.underline}]{.mark} more than **[three
[decades]{.mark}]{.underline}** and contains entries [on **a semi-annual
frequency**]{.underline}, to estimate the effects of economic growth on
the support for extremism. Our empirical analysis
[[show]{.underline}]{.mark}s a significant negative effect of real per
capita GDP growth on the support for extreme right-wing parties:
controlling for country and time fixed effects, [[a **one
percent**]{.underline}]{.mark}age point [[decline
in]{.underline}]{.mark} real per capita [**GDP [growth]{.mark}**
[increases]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[vote share of **extreme**]{.mark}
**right-wing [parties]{.mark}** [by]{.mark}]{.underline} up to
**[[one]{.mark} percent]{.underline}**age point. We document that
[the]{.underline} negative [effect]{.underline} of economic growth on
the support for right-wing extremism [is **robust** across **estimation
techniques** and **model specifications**]{.underline}. We do not find a
systematic effect of growth on the support for left-wing extremism.

A possible explanation for the differential effects between left-wing
and right-wing extremism that relates closely to our theoretical model
is that right-wing extremism might be associated with more uncertainty
over what groups will be subject to income expropriation in the future.
Left-wing extremism is associated with income redistribution, but little
uncertainty exists over its target. Communist doctrine (see, for
example, the Communist Manifesto by Marx and Engels 1848), envisions a
classless society; i.e., a society wherein incomes are distributed
equally. Over the past century, extreme left-wing parties have followed
closely that doctrine by proposing to redistribute incomes from rich to
poor; as opposition parties they have voted against laissez faire
policies and, when in power, they have implemented programs that reduced
the wealth and income prospects of the rich (see, e.g., Brown 2010).

Right-wing extremism, in contrast to left-wing extremism, does not
advocate a classless society. Instead, it often is associated with
discrimination against specific groups of society for racial, religios,
political or other reasons.2 An extreme case of a murderous and
discriminatory regime was the German fascist rule during the first half
of the 20th century. One can see it as a direct consequence of the Nazi
party\'s \"Fuhrerprinzip\"---\"the principle of unconditional authority
of the leader\" (Bernholz 2017, p.9)---which created considerable
uncertainty over who might be stigmatized, imprisoned or killed in the
future.3 Indeed, from the Nazi period we know that various groups were
stigmatized for different reasons4 and that stigmatization also was
particularly erratic.5,6

The empirical analysis of our paper is related to Stevenson (2001), who
examines the determinants of aggregate policy preferences in a panel of
14 European countries. One of Stevenson\'s main findings is that
declines in economic growth cause policy preferences to shift to the
right, while increases in economic growth cause policy preferences to
shift to the left.7 Our paper differs from Stevenson in at least three
important aspects. First, in contrast to Stevenson, we show that our
[empirical results are robust to [controlling for]{.mark} **country
[fixed effects]{.mark}**, meaning]{.underline} that our
[results]{.underline} also [hold at the **within-country level**, and
not just in **cross-section**]{.underline}. Relatedly, Acemoglu et al.
(2008, 2009) showed that the cross-country relation between income and
democracy turns insignificant when country fixed effects are entered
into the econometric model. Second, we provide evidence that our
[empirical findings [reflect a **causal effect** of]{.mark} **economic
[growth]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} **political
[extremism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We show that our main findings are
robust to estimating dynamic models that enable to test for Granger
causality; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} we also show that the main
findings [[hold with]{.underline}]{.mark} an **[[instrumental
variables]{.underline}]{.mark}** approach. Third, we distinguish in our
empirical analysis between extreme right-wing and extreme left-wing
parties. That distinction matters: a robust negative effect of economic
growth is found on the support for extreme right-wing parties, whereas
no systematic effect exists for the support of extreme left-wing
parties. Our finding of a significant negative effect of economic growth
on the support for right-wing extremism is in line with the finding of
Bromhead et al. (2012), who show that the [vote share of right-wing
extremists during **the Great Depression** was significantly larger
in]{.underline} those [countries that experienced a more severe economic
crisis]{.underline}. Using subnational [data for **218 European
regions** during 1990-2016]{.underline}, Rao et al. (2018) [find a
**significant negative effect** of]{.underline} regional [output on the
vote share of extreme right-wing parties]{.underline}, but no signicant
effect on extreme left-wing parties.

Is the likelihood that a democracy will take military action against
other countries largely influenced by which party controls the
presidency? Many believe so (Palmer, London, and Regan 2004; Arena and
Palmer 2009; Clare 2010). In modern American politics, one party is
consistently identified as more hawkish than the other.
[Surveys]{.underline} have [reveal]{.underline}ed that [Republican
voters]{.underline} consistently [prefer more aggressive
policies]{.underline} (Eundak 2006; Trager and Vavreck 2011; Gries
2014). Moreover, many believe that Al Gore, had he been elected, would
not have invaded Iraq like President George W. Bush did (Jervis 2003;
Lieberfeld 2005), and that the foreign policies of Hillary Clinton and
Donald Trump would be similarly opposed (Paletta 2016).

Nevertheless, it is very difficult to determine whether the party in
control of the presidency really has an important impact on foreign
policy due to the selection of parties into particular domestic and
international contexts. Put simply, which party controls the presidency
is not random. For example, the victory of George W. Bush in 2004 can be
attributed to a number of domestic and international factors at the
time, including the American public\'s heightened concerns over national
security following September 11. Similarly, Barack Obama\'s success in
2008 was influenced by problems at home and a decrease in public
willingness to engage in military adventurism. Therefore, an
[**observational [analysis]{.mark}** would]{.underline} likely [be
[**biased** by]{.mark}]{.underline} such **[[selection]{.mark}
processes]{.underline}**. Thus, [even if countries behave differently
when certain parties control the presidency, it would be]{.underline}
very [**difficult** to know if that]{.underline} difference [is
explained by]{.underline} the [parties or]{.underline} by [**the
environments** into which the parties are selected]{.underline}.

In principle, [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} could [[**overcome**
this]{.underline}]{.mark} problem [by]{.underline} running [an
experiment in which we **randomly assigned countries** to be ruled by
**leaders from different parties**. Such]{.underline} an ideal research
design [would avoid]{.underline} the **[confounding]{.underline}**
problem, [making it **possible to test** whether countries tend to
be]{.underline} more or less [aggressive when]{.underline} certain
[parties control the presidency]{.underline}. Experiments are unmatched
in their ability to identify causal effects, so this type of study could
greatly improve our understanding of how electing candidates from
different parties influences foreign policy.

We approximate this ideal experiment by [using]{.underline} a
**[[regression discontinuity]{.underline}]{.mark}** (RD) design.
Specifically, [we look at **close presidential elections** where a
candidate]{.underline} from one party [barely defeated]{.underline} a
candidate from [a different party]{.underline}. Such a design works if
it is close to random which party won in these cases, a premise which is
plausible given the inherent randomness in large national elections.
Thus, we use close elections to get data that are similar to what would
result from a real experiment. Such natural experimental designs are
extremely rare in the study of war and thus warrant attention in the
exceptional instances when they do occur.

We run two main analyses. First, we look at whether countries tend to be
more (or less) aggressive when presidential candidates from right-wing
parties barely defeat candidates from left-wing parties. This
quasi-experimental comparison involves a small sample size (n = 29), but
we still find noteworthy evidence that electing right-wing candidates
increases the likelihood that countries will initiate high-level
military disputes against other states. Second, to increase our
statistical power, we examine cases where candidates from incumbent
parties barely won or barely lost to candidates from challenger parties
(n = 36). Specifically, we test whether countries experienced a larger
change in their propensity to engage in military disputes when the
candidate from the challenger party barely won. Thus, our key outcome of
interest here is how much countries deviated from their prior levels of
dispute involvement. [We [find **statistically significant
ev**]{.mark}**idence** that]{.underline} electing candidates from
challenger parties causes countries to experience a larger change in
their propensity to engage in military conflict with other states.

Upon further examination of the data, we find that the results from our
second test are largely explained by a tendency for candidates from
challenger parties to initiate military disputes in their first year in
office. Thus, these findings support the theory that major
**[[leadership transitions]{.underline}]{.mark}** tend to
[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} the chances of [state
[aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}, either [[because new leaders
**lack**]{.mark} **the [experience]{.mark}** [to **manage**]{.mark}
**international [crises]{.mark}** effectively [or]{.mark}]{.underline}
because [they [need to **prove**]{.mark} **their [resolve]{.mark}** [by
**acting tough**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This article makes several important contributions to the study of
international relations. First, there is a long-standing debate in
political science over whether leaders have an important independent
impact on interstate conflict or whether their influence is largely
constrained by strategic realities (Byman and Pollack 2001; Mearsheimer
and Walt 2003; Jones and Olken 2009; Chiozza and Goemans 2011; Saunders
2011; Horowitz, Stam, and Ellis 2015; Croco 2015). This study provides
quasi-experimental evidence that leaders do have a meaningful impact on
foreign policy. Second, the results presented here suggest that domestic
political ideology can spill over into the international realm. One of
the main explanations for the democratic peace is that democracies act
in accordance with their domestic norms when it comes to foreign policy
(Morgan and Campbell 1991). The findings presented here support that
hypothesis by showing that left-wing leaders do tend to behave more
dovishly in international affairs. Third, these [[results
suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} that we should be alert to the potential
for [[**interstate conflict** when]{.underline}]{.mark} right-wing
leaders are in office, as well as after elections where party control of
the [[presidency changes]{.mark} hands]{.underline}.

[This study is]{.underline} also notable because it is one of [the
**first**]{.underline} in the international relations literature [to
use]{.underline} a [**preanalysis plan**. Prior to looking
at]{.underline} any of the [results, we **pre-registered**
the]{.underline} main [tests]{.underline} that we planned to conduct in
this article. Our motivation here was [to **tie our
hands**]{.underline}, so that [there could be **no question** of sifting
through the data to find]{.underline} the statistical tests that
produced the most interesting or [significant results]{.underline}. The
temptation for scholars to run many tests and then report the ones that
are most \"interesting\" can lead to misleading findings. This danger
has attracted a great deal of attention across scientific fields over
the last decade, and it is seen by many as a major problem for
quantitative research (Nosek et al. 2015). The purpose of preanalysis
plans is to help ensure that research remains credible.

The article proceeds as follows. We first discuss the theoretical bases
for the claim that party control of the presidency influences conflict
decisions and review the existing empirical work on this subject. We
then outline the research design in more detail. Next, we conduct design
checks to verify that the research design is appropriate. We then
present the results for party ideology. After that, we test whether
party turnover leads to changes in the likelihood of state aggression.
We then discuss the findings and conclude.

Leaders, Parties, and International Conflict

In recent years, much debate has arisen over whether leaders influence
the chances of interstate conflict, and if so, how. A major question in
this research program is whether leaders from certain parties are more
likely to behave aggressively in foreign affairs or whether the ideology
of the leader is largely unrelated to state behavior.

The theory that party control of the presidency influences the chances
of interstate conflict can be derived from three premises. The first is
that [conservatives and liberals hold different views about the
legitimacy or efficacy of military force. This]{.underline} assumption
[is backed by **cross-national survey data**]{.underline} showing that
liberals tend to be more concerned with fairness, duties of care, and
preventing harm, while conservatives tend to favor the preservation of
social orders, the purity of sanctified objects, and loyalty to
in-groups (Graham, Haidt, and Nosek 2009; Boer and Fischer 2013).
[**Several studies** have]{.underline} also [found]{.underline} that
these differences in moral foundations influence foreign policy
attitudes (Schwartz 1992; Kertzer et al. 2014; Kertzer and Rathbun
2015). In particular, [liberals]{.underline} are more \"prosocial\" and
[seek **[compromise]{.mark}**]{.underline} internationally, [in
[contrast]{.mark} to [conservatives, who]{.mark}]{.underline} are more
\"proself" and therefore **[[bargain]{.mark} more
[aggressively]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Schwartz, Caprara, and Vecchione
2010).

The second assumption is that general differences in party attitudes
appear at the elite level. There are two ways that these differences
could affect the behavior of political elites. First, the political
leaders could sincerely hold beliefs and preferences similar to those of
their constituents, leading them to have different foreign policy
strategies and goals. Alternatively, the leaders could have different
beliefs and attitudes than their constituents, but nonetheless recognize
that they must carry out their supporters\' agenda if they hope to stay
in office.

Although it is difficult to know the extent to which leaders true
foreign policy preferences reflect those of their constituents, several
observational studies show that changes in a leader\'s base correlate
with changes in their approach to international affairs. First, Mattes,
Leeds, and Carroll (2015) find that changes in the supporting coalitions
of leaders predict foreign policy change, measured by the policy
positions taken by nations in the United Nations General Assembly.
Rathbun (2004) and Haas (2005) come to a similar conclusion looking at
support for peace-enforcement missions, and [Solingen]{.underline}
(2009) [finds]{.underline} that economic interests and the
[[ideologies]{.mark} of partisan coalitions [influence nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} policy. Therefore, [even when a leader has
different]{.underline} foreign policy [beliefs]{.underline} and goals
[than]{.underline} the rest of [the party, there may]{.underline} still
[be pressure to **toe the party line**]{.underline}.

The third assumption is that leaders from different parties can act on
their divergent preferences. This means that international and domestic
constraints on leaders cannot be so powerful that they largely limit
leaders to a single course of action. For example, some realists argue
that there is little room for leaders to have an independent impact on
foreign policy because they all need to defend and advance the national
interest (Mearsheimer 2001; Mearsheimer and Walt 2003). Regarding
domestic constraints, Trager and Vavreck (2011) find that right-wing and
left-wing leaders can have incentives to hide their \"types.\" Liberal
leaders may be forced to adopt more hawkish foreign policies because
they fear that their moderation will sometimes be interpreted as
weakness (Schultz 2005), whereas conservative leaders may have
incentives to adopt more moderate policies because the public would
likely judge them unduly aggressive if they acted hawkishly. Thus,
leader preferences and political incentives could actually push in
opposite directions.

Several **[previous studies]{.underline}** have examined whether
right-wing leaders tend to behave more aggressively in foreign policy
than left-wing leaders. Using logistic regression on panel data covering
eighteen parliamentary democracies from 1949 to 1992, Palmer, London and
Regan (2004) find that right-wing governments are more likely to be
involved in military disputes, while left-wing governments are more
likely to see the disputes in which they are involved in escalate. Their
explanation is that right-wing parties favor using force more often, so
their leaders will engage in military conflict more often. However, when
left-wing leaders engage in conflict, they will need to emerge
victorious to justify their involvement, so they will be more likely to
bargain tough and escalate if necessary. These researchers find that a
shift from left to right government increases the chances of dispute
initiation by about 50 percent and that left-wing governments are about
twice as likely to escalate conditional on being in a dispute. Second,
Arena and Palmer (2009) apply a probit model to panel data covering
twenty stable democracies from 1960 to 1996 and find that right-wing
governments are more likely to initiate disputes. Their theory is based
on the finding that right-wing leaders are less likely to be removed
from office for using force unwisely than left-wing leaders. This makes
right-wing leaders more likely to start international conflicts in the
hopes of increasing their domestic support. Third, Clare (2010) applies
logistic regression to twenty parliamentary democracies from 1950 to
1998 and finds that parliamentary democracies are about twice as likely
to initiate disputes when they are controlled by right-wing parties.

The central limitation of these studies is that their conclusions [rest
on]{.underline} the results of [**regression analysis** on
cross-national panel data]{.underline}. Such an approach is not
guaranteed to eliminate bias from omitted variables. In fact, the
results from [this]{.underline} type of [analysis can be **badly
biased**, even when researchers control for]{.underline} a wide range of
important [covariates]{.underline} (Clarke 2005). In some cases,
[[controlling for]{.underline}]{.mark} potential [[con-founders]{.mark}
can]{.underline} even **[[amplify bias]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Pearl
2013). Thus, the results from these [[past studies should be interpreted
as]{.mark} a **[tentative]{.mark} first cut**]{.underline} at answering
this question [[rather than]{.mark} the **[final]{.mark}
word**]{.underline} on the subject.

[The design]{.underline}-based approach that [we employ]{.underline} in
this article [gets around the omitted variable bias problem because the
as-if random assignment of leaders to office should create **balance**
across]{.underline} observable and unobservable [pretreatment
characteristics]{.underline}. In many other scientific fields, [the
results of **[conventional]{.mark} observational [analyses]{.mark}**
[have been overturned]{.mark}]{.underline} by design-based studies. For
example, the validity of hormone replacement therapy and a variety of
theories in development economics, psychology, and elsewhere have been
overturned when experimental and quasi-experimental approaches were
brought to bear (Women\'s Health Initiative 2002; Freedman 2009; Dunning
2012). Therefore, the tests that we present in this article provide an
important step forward in our understanding of the empirical
relationship between party control of the presidency and interstate
conflict.

Before moving on to our research design, though, we should first lay out
the hypotheses that we want to test. As we detail in our preanalysis
plan, we started this project with the belief that leaders do matter and
that electing leaders from different parties does affect the likelihood
of state aggression. Given this prior, we formulated two main
hypotheses. The first is the party ideology hypothesis, which predicts
that electing leaders from right-wing parties will increase the
likelihood of state aggression. The second hypothesis is highly general
and speaks directly to the question of whether leaders matter in
international relations. It posits that electing a leader from the
incumbent party will lead to less change in international dispute
behavior than electing a leader from a challenger party. We refer to
this as the incumbent/challenger hypothesis.

Party Ideology Hypothesis: Electing presidential candidates from
right-wing parties will make countries more aggressive than electing
candidates from left-wing parties.

Incumbent/Challenger Hypothesis: Electing candidates from challenger
parties will lead to a greater change in state aggression than electing
candidates from incumbent parties (the absolute difference in aggression
between presidential terms will be greater when there is party
turnover).

One issue that is related to the incumbent/challenger hypothesis is that
new leaders may be particularly likely to act aggressively early in
their terms. There are several reasons why this might be the case.
First, new leaders may lack the experience to manage international
crises effectively, making it more likely that disagreements with other
states will turn into military conflicts (Potter 2007). Second, new
leaders may be more likely to want to show the international community
that they are willing to use force abroad, which could strengthen their
bargaining leverage in future international negotiations (Wolford 2007;
Dafoe 2012). Third, new leaders may want to send a signal to their
domestic audiences that they are tough when it comes to foreign affairs,
which could increase their popularity at home. This idea that leaders
are more likely to get involved in military disputes when they first
arrive in office has received support from cross-national logistic
regression analysis on panel data (Gelpi and Grieco 2001) and a
mixed-methods analysis that looks at American presidents (Potter 2007).

While most of the existing theory and research on leadership transitions
has focused on cases where new leaders come to office, a similar logic
might be applied to party control of the presidency, particularly when
it comes to the reputational mechanisms. New leaders who are from the
same party as the old one should be able to associate themselves with
the previous leader\'s reputation, giving them less of a need to signal
their resolve. On the other hand, when leaders from challenger parties
come to power, there should be less certainty that the new leader will
have an approach to foreign policy that is similar to the old one\'s. In
short, when party control of the presidency changes hands, it marks a
more significant leadership transition (Mattes, Leeds, and Matsumura
2016). Thus, even if parties tend to behave pretty similarly across
ideologies, we might still find that leaders from challenger parties
might be much more aggressive early in their tenures.

Challenger Aggression Hypothesis: Electing candidates from challenger
parties will lead to an increase in state aggression when the new leader
takes office.

We did not preregister the challenger aggression hypothesis prior to
looking at the results, but this was the only hypothesis we tested
outside of those we preregis-tered. Thus, the findings do not reflect
data mining. Nevertheless, some readers may wish to interpret the test
of this particular hypothesis as exploratory.

Research Design

There are several different design-based approaches that could be used
to investigate how leaders affect state behavior. One would be to look
at all cases of leadership turnover and compare how countries behaved
before and after the leadership change. This research design rests on
the idea that countries are comparable before and after leadership
transitions. This assumption may be plausible in some cases, but in
others, it is clearly invalid. For example, the periods before and after
normal electoral leader transitions are usually not comparable. Many
countries elect the leader and members of the legislature at the same
time, making it difficult to determine the effect of leadership change
by itself. Similarly, looking at cases when leaders were forcibly
removed from office also has its limitations, since leaders are usually
removed at times of extreme political tension. Likewise, leadership
changes that are caused by assassinations are not likely to provide
valid comparisons. The new leader will probably have to deal with a more
complicated political situation in the aftermath of the assassination,
making the beginning of their term much different from the end of the
previous leader\'s term.

Another potentially promising approach would be to focus on changes in
leadership that resulted from the natural deaths of leaders. The timing
of natural leader deaths should be fairly unrelated to the domestic and
international environments. Moreover, the legislature will typically not
change following the natural death of a leader, making it much easier to
isolate the independent effect of leaders on foreign policy. However,
the natural death approach is not well-suited for this particular study.
The reason is that the new leader almost always comes from the same
party as the old leader. Thus, this exogenous change in leadership does
not provide much leverage in determining how party control of the
presidency affects interstate conflict. This research design could be
useful in looking at other types of variation in leaders, such as age,
military experience, and occupational background. However, it is not a
promising design for this study.

The approach that we take instead is to use an RD design. RD involves
comparing units that barely surpassed and barely fell short of an
important cut point that influenced treatment assignment. For example,
if there was a test where everyone who scored a fifty or higher got a
scholarship, researchers could assess the effects of getting the
scholarship by comparing the students who scored fifty and fifty-one to
the students who scored forty-eight and forty-nine. So long as there is
no sorting at the cut point, as could happen if the graders had
opportunity and motive to nudge some test takers above the cut point, it
should be close to random which of these students won the scholarship,
since they were all on the verge of getting it (Lee 2008).

Close elections provide an excellent opportunity to use RD analysis.
Given the inherent randomness in the electoral process, whether
candidates barely win or barely lose in close elections is plausibly
as-if random (Eggers et al. 2015).1 Political scientists have used RD to
study questions like how winning an election influences a party\'s
likelihood of winning the next election (Lee 2008) and how winning an
election affects a candidate\'s wealth later in life (Eggers and
Hainmueller 2009). Scholars have also used RD to test how economic and
political outcomes differ when Republican candidates for mayor barely
defeat or barely lose to Democratic candidates (Pettersson-Lidbom 2008;
Gerber and Hopkins 2011; Beland 2015; de Benedictis-Kessner and Warshaw
2016).

In this article, we look at close presidential elections. To our
knowledge, this study is the first to apply RD specifically to
presidential elections. For our analysis, we followed the procedures
that were outlined in our preanalysis plan (which is available at the
end of the Online Appendix). We will briefly summarize these procedures
in the remainder of this section.

Our Statistical Approach

There are two general ways to analyze an RD. The first, known as the
continuity approach, involves plotting two smoothing functions on either
side of the cut point and estimating the difference at the cut point
(Voeten 2014). This method should be used when the score, or \"forcing
variable,\" is continuous. The second method is the local-randomization
approach, appropriate when the forcing variable is discrete (Lee and
Card 2008; Cattaneo, Frandsen, and Titiunik 2015; Bertoli 2017). It
involves drawing a window around the cut point and treating the units
within that window like they were in a randomized experiment.

Since the forcing variable in this study is vote share in a presidential
election, which is essentially continuous, we would normally use the
continuity approach. However, we discovered in our preanalysis plan that
the continuity approach had a type 1 error rate (false-positive rate) of
12 percent for this study, which we believe is due to our small sample
size. Since the type 1 error rate should be 5 percent by design, we
chose not to use this method, since it was overly likely to give us
significant results. Instead, we used the local-randomization approach,
which we found had a type 1 error rate of about 4 percent.

Defining Close Elections

We considered elections to be close if the top two candidates were
within 2 percent of the cut point (48 percent to 52 percent range). Data
on close races were available in the data set constructed by Bertoli,
Dafoe, and Trager (2018). This data set includes every democratic
election between 1815 and 2010, where democracies are defined as
countries with Polity IV Institutionalized Democracy scores above five.
The data set provides information on the top two candidates including
their names, parties, and vote shares in the election. If there were
more than two candidates running in an election, we focused only on the
votes for the top two candidates, rescaling their vote shares
accordingly. In cases where there were runoffs, we used their vote
shares from the runoff rather than the initial election. We also
excluded close elections in nondemocracies because we were concerned
about fraud in these cases. Given the possibility of fraud, we did not
feel confident in assuming that the outcomes of these elections were
as-if random.

One complication that arose is that the United States elects presidents
through the electoral college. This system makes it possible for
candidates to lose the popular vote but still win the election if they
defeat their rival in the electoral college. To deal with this issue, we
counted the electoral college vote rather than the popular vote when
looking at the United States. This decision is consistent with other
similar studies (Bertoli, Dafoe, and Trager 2018). For every other
country, we used the popular vote.

Measuring Party Ideology

To identify parties as left or right-wing, we evaluated the parties
against each other according to their positions at the time of the
election on social questions associated with liberalism and
conservatism. Parties were judged further to the right when they
expressed support for \"traditional values,\" national, religious,
racial, or ethnic in-groups, or the benefits of authority and
traditional sources of authority such as a monarchy. Parties were judged
further to the left when they expressed inclusive sentiments, a duty of
care for vulnerable groups, and support for democratic principles.
Secondarily, we evaluated parties as left or right on economic policy
preferences. Advocacy for wealthier interests placed a candidate further
to the right, and advocacy for the less well-off is associated with the
left. These two social and economic dimensions are highly correlated,
with the principal exceptions coming from communist and postcommunist
countries. In these cases, the primary social dimension determined the
left-right coding. When parties could not be easily classified as left
or right according to these metrics, we excluded the election from the
ideology test.

Main Analyses

We looked at two different types of close elections. The first were
close elections between right-wing and left-wing parties, where it was
essentially random whether the presidency was controlled by a leader
with a right-wing or left-wing ideology. In total, we have twenty-nine
close elections between right-wing and left-wing parties. The second set
of close elections that we analyzed was narrow races between an
incumbent and challenger party. In these cases, it was as-if random
whether the country experienced party continuity or change in the
executive branch. We have thirty-six of these close elections in our
data set. For this group of cases, we were particularly interested in
testing whether a change in party control of the presidency increased
the likelihood of a change in state aggression.

Although our sample sizes are not large, the power tests that we ran at
the beginning of this project indicated that we had a good chance of
picking up a medium-sized or large effect. For the test of left- versus
right-wing parties, we determined we would correctly detect (at a = .05)
a medium-sized effect (0.5 standard deviation \[SD\]) 30 percent of the
time, a large effect (0.8 SD) 54 percent of the time, and a very large
effect (1.2 SD) 82 percent of the time. In the incumbency power
analysis, we found that we would detect a medium-sized effect 55 percent
of the time, a large effect 93 percent of the time, and a very large
effect over 99 percent of the time. Also, if the effects were small or
nonexistent, the power tests indicated that we would be able to
establish confidence intervals that were precise enough to rule out very
large (+1.2 SD) positive and negative effects.2

Moreover, although the results turn out to be significant at
conventional levels, we encourage readers to avoid interpreting p values
as either significant (p \< .05) or not while reading this article and
to bear the bias-variance trade-off in research design in mind. Almost
all quantitative research in international relations lacks any claim to
strong causal identification, being based on observational data and
linear adjustment of largely ad hoc covariate sets. By contrast, the
design presented here has a strong claim to causal identification and
unbiasedness, providing a crucial complement to the vast majority of the
literature which does not. Thus, since p values provide a continuous
measure of how inconsistent the evidence is with the null hypothesis, a
higher p value in an unbiased design may actually reflect more evidence
against the null than a lower p value in a biased one. Small p values
(e.g., p \< .2), even if not significant at conventional standards, also
provide important evidence in these contexts.

In addition to our two main tests, we examined whether candidates from
challenger parties are more likely to initiate military disputes at the
beginning of their terms than candidates from incumbent parties, which
would be consistent with the theory that major leadership transitions
make state aggression more likely. Our motivation for running this test
came from reading Wolford (2007), Dafoe (2012), and Wu and Wolford
(2016). These articles advance a compelling theory and intriguing
empirical evidence that new leaders have reputational incentives to act
tough when they first come to office. We find strong evidence consistent
with this hypothesis.

Outcomes

We measured aggression using the number of militarized interstate
disputes (MIDs) that a country initiates. These disputes are cases where
countries explicitly threatened, displayed, or used force against other
states (Ghosn, Palmer, and Bremer 2004). Specifically, we look at the
number of these disputes that a state initiated starting from when the
leader took office and ending at the date that the winner of the next
election was scheduled to start. In cases where leaders were replaced
part of the way through their term, we used the day that they left
office instead. Since the length of time that candidates held office
varied, we divided the total number of disputes by the duration of the
time period. Thus, the unit of measurement is military disputes
initiated per year in office.

We use slightly different versions of the outcome variables for our
different tests. For the ideology test, we use military disputes
initiated per year, as described in the previous paragraph. For the main
incumbency test, we use the absolute change in military disputes
initiated per year from the previous term. We use this variable because
we are interested in evaluating whether there was a larger absolute
change in military aggression when the challenger party barely won.
Thus, the measure is:

Absolute change in military aggression =\|MIDs/year during winner\'s
term

---MIDs/year during previous term\|

In other words, we are testing whether challenger parties gaining
control of the presidency makes countries with high levels of prior
aggression more likely to experience a decrease in dispute initiation
and countries with low levels of prior aggression more likely to
experience an increase in dispute initiation. We conduct a one-sided
test for this analysis, since we expect that the absolute change will be
larger for countries where the challenger party barely wins. Lastly, for
the exploratory test about whether challenger candidates tend to be more
aggressive when they first take office, we look at the number of
disputes that each country initiated in the first year of the new
presidential term.

Across these tests, our main outcomes are (1) military disputes
initiated and (2) high-level military disputes initiated. High-level
disputes are cases where countries used force against other states or
entered into international wars.3 Following the preanalysis plan, we
examine high-level disputes, which constitute actual uses of force,
separately because the factors that drive posturing may be different
from those that drive actual violence. As secondary outcomes, we look at
(3) all disputes that countries engaged in and (4) all high-level
disputes that countries engaged in. These cases include disputes that
countries did not start but participated in nonetheless.

Estimation

We employ two estimation strategies. Our primary statistical analysis
involves t tests. This is a simple approach, recommended for its
parsimony and robustness, which is appropriate given the assumption that
close elections were as-if random (Dunning 2012). As a secondary test,
we plot the outcome as a function of the electoral result and estimate
how the expected value of the outcome changes at the cut point using
local linear regression, as is often done for RD designs. An advantage
with using this approach is that it makes it possible to visualize how
outcomes change at the cut point.

Design Checks

Our research design rests on one main assumption, necessary for
internally valid estimates: the outcomes of the close elections
considered in this study are as-if random. For example, the design would
be invalid if any candidates could precisely manipulate their vote
shares around the cut point, such as by counting the votes and adding
just enough to win. This assumption should be valid for democracies
provided that elections are fair (Eggers et al. 2015).

A second \"representativeness\" assumption facilitates generalizing from
our results, and this is that the democracy years experiencing close
elections are not dissimilar to democracy years in which elections are
not close. If this assumption is reasonable, then we can generalize from
our results to all democracy years. However, if the countries that had
close elections are not representative of other democracies, then the
causal estimates that we find may not reflect broader patterns in
international relations.

We can test the as-if randomness assumption in two ways. First, we can
check that the samples are balanced on important pretreatment
characteristics. Figure 1 plots the balance using two-sided t tests. The
graph on the left shows that countries where right-wing parties barely
won were very similar to countries where left-wing parties barely won,
and the graph on the right shows that countries where incumbent parties
barely won were similar to countries where challenger parties barely
won. In Figure 1, we look at twenty-four covariates, and not a single
one is significantly imbalanced. Thus, the data are consistent with the
assumption that who won these close elections was as-if random.

\[Figure One Omitted\]

\[Figure Two Omitted\]

Second, we can test whether there is balance in the number of cases on
either side of the cut point. Figure 2 shows how close right-wing and
incumbent parties were to winning the presidency. For the twenty-nine
close elections between right-wing and left-wing parties, there were
sixteen cases where the right-wing party won and thirteen cases where
the left-wing party won (p = .71). Similarly, for the thirty-six close
elections between incumbent and challenger parties, there were seventeen
cases where the incumbent party won and nineteen cases where the
challenger party won (p = .87). Thus, there is no evidence of sorting in
either sample.

\[Figure Three Omitted\]

We can also evaluate the external validity assumption by comparing the
two samples to the broader population of all democracies since 1815.
Figure 3 uses box-plots to compare our samples to the broader population
with respect to covariates related to military power. The comparisons
show that our samples are very similar to the broader population of
democracies from 1815 to 2010. Thus, at least with respect to these
covariates, there is little reason to believe that either of our samples
consist of an idiosyncratic group of countries that would behave
differently than most other democracies. Rather, the representativeness
of our samples indicates that our results should be indicative of
broader trends in international relations.

In sum, the outcomes of the close elections appear to be random, and the
countries where the close elections happened are fairly representative
of all other democracies. Therefore, the design appears to have worked
very well. In the next two sections, we will look at how electing
presidential candidates from different parties affects state aggression
using this new empirical approach.

Results for Party Ideology

Our results indicate that [right-wing parties tend to be **more
aggressive** than left-wing parties]{.underline}. Table 1 shows the
aggression levels of the countries that had close elections between
right-wing and left-wing candidates. On average, the countries where
right-wing parties barely won started .06 more disputes per year than
countries where left-wing parties barely won. Similarly, they engaged in
.10 more high-level disputes per year than countries where left-wing
parties barely won. Given that the average duration of a presidential
term for these countries is 4 years and 169 days, this adds up to .32
more disputes initiated and .43 more high-level disputes initiated over
an average presidential term.

Figure 4 plots the estimates for the two main outcome variables along
with the two other indicators of aggression. The **[confidence
intervals]{.underline}** are based on two-tailed t tests. They
[suggest]{.underline} that [electing right-wing parties does increase
state aggression]{.underline}, particularly when it comes to high-level
disputes. Of course, all of these confidence intervals cover zero, so we
cannot rule out zero effect with 95 percent confidence based on this
analysis alone. The estimate most different from zero is of high-level
disputes initiated (p = .25). For disputes initiated, the results appear
to be more consistent with no effect (p = .64), as do the results for
the supplemental tests of all disputes and all high-level disputes.

\[Table One Omitted\]

\[Figure Four Omitted\]

However, [if we look at]{.underline} the **[specific
disputes]{.underline}** in more detail, [the evidence]{.underline} that
electing right-wing leaders increases state aggression [grows
stronger]{.underline}. While [[all]{.underline}]{.mark} the high-level
[[disputes]{.mark} that]{.underline} the [right-wing leaders engaged in
[involved **unequivocal**]{.mark} **uses of
[force]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the only high-level dispute that any of
the left-wing leaders initiated is questionable and should probably be
excluded. This dispute was between Costa Rica and Nicaragua in 1995, and
it did not involve any military action by either country. Costa Rican
police crossed the Nicaraguan border in pursuit of suspects and were
arrested. Two days later, the Costa Rican police force retaliated by
arresting two Nicaraguan police officers who had crossed the border \"to
get a drink of water.\" The two sides made a prisoner swap on the
following day. If this case is dropped, then electing right-wing parties
appears to lead countries to initiate . 12 more high-level disputes per
year (p = .162).4

Moreover, the only reason that these results are not significant is
because the United States (2001) is an outlier, which inflates the
standard errors. We can address this issue by [modifying the outcome to
a **simple indicator variable**]{.underline} for whether countries
initiated any high-level disputes ([no]{.underline} = 0,
[yes]{.underline} = 1), which [makes our test **insensitive to
outliers**]{.underline}. The estimates then suggest that electing
right-wing parties increases the chances that countries will initiate
high-level military disputes by 25 percent (p = .041). Therefore, even
though the initial tests were not statistically significant, they become
more conclusive after we address some minor issues with the data.

Given the number of democracies in the world today, there may be enough
close elections to get much more precise estimates a decade or two from
now or maybe even after the next expansion of the MID data set. This
design is definitely worth returning to in the near future. However, for
the present, we will turn to a second test in the next section on more
data that yields increased statistical power. This test provides further
evidence that which party controls the presidency does affect the
likelihood of state aggression.

Results for Incumbent versus Challenger Parties

The second test that we run compares cases where challenger parties
barely defeated incumbent parties to cases where they barely lost to
incumbent parties. In these cases, it was as-if random whether the
incumbent or challenger party won. Thus, we can test how much military
aggression changes when the party that controls the executive branch
changes. The outcomes that we use for this test are the absolute changes
in the military indicators between the term when the incumbent or
challenger party barely won and the previous term. For this analysis, we
use one-sided tests that assume that there will tend to be a larger
change in military aggression when the challenger party barely wins.

Table 2 shows the absolute change in aggression levels for the countries
that had close elections between candidates from incumbent and
challenger parties. [[When the]{.underline}]{.mark} candidates from
[[challenger]{.underline}]{.mark} parties barely
[[won]{.underline}]{.mark}, the absolute change in disputes initiated
per year was .031 greater than when candidates from incumbent parties
barely won (p = .30; 26 percent increase from baseline). For high-level
disputes, the difference is even more notable. The absolute change in
[[**high-level disputes** initiated]{.underline}]{.mark} per year
[[was]{.underline}]{.mark} .074 greater than when candidates from
incumbent parties barely won (p = .046, [[133 percent increase]{.mark}
from baseline]{.underline}). The average length of the presidential
terms for these data was 4.42 years, so this adds up to a difference of
.33 high-level disputes initiated per presidential term. Figure 5 plots
the confidence intervals for the aggression indicators.

[This]{.underline} estimated [effect is **substantively large** relative
to other determinants of conflict]{.underline} that international
relations scholars have analyzed. For example, past studies have found
that revolutions increase the likelihood that countries will initiate
military disputes by about 74 percent (Colgan 2010), arms transfers by
about 60 percent (Krause 2004), and neutrality pacts with potential
conflict joiners by about 57 percent (Leeds 2003). The effect of
challenger parties winning appears to be in the ballpark of these
estimates, although it is hard to nail down this effect very precisely
because of the relatively small sample size.

Figure 6 illustrates the effect for high-level disputes across a greater
range of margins of victory. As countries move from incumbent party
victories (the points on the left) to challenger party victories (the
points on the right), there is a large shift in the absolute change in
high-level disputes initiated. Countries where the challenger party
barely won experienced a much larger change than countries where the
incumbent party barely won. Although this method of estimating the
treatment effect was not the primary method that we discussed in our
preanalysis plan, the [results]{.underline} for this approach [are
**fairly conclusive**]{.underline}.

While [the surge of **[populism]{.mark}**]{.underline} throughout
Europe---[[in response to]{.underline}]{.mark} terrorism and
[[**economic stagnation**---means]{.mark} that "**[renationalization is
visible]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} particularly in France during an
election year, Hoyer insisted that when "[the]{.underline} cooperative
approach and the **[[multilat]{.mark}eral approach]{.underline}** [[is
being put into question]{.mark} in an **irresponsible
way**]{.underline}... it is important to explain again the values of
international cooperation." In France, Emmanuel Macron of the En Marche!
movement and Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front party won the
first and second spots, respectively, in the first round of the
presidential elections on April 23. They will face each other in a
runoff election on May 7. Le Pen has called for a French departure from
the European Union (EU), and stricter border controls. Her calls for
harsh security measures intensified after a policeman was shot dead in
Paris on April 20, an attack claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and
al-Sham (ISIS). In contrast, Macron is an outspoken advocate of the EU,
and the benefits of international cooperation. [With [each]{.mark} new
administration and [change of government]{.mark} in Europe, "we [have
a]{.mark} certain [temptation to **cut the branch on which we**]{.mark}
**are [sit]{.mark}ting**]{.underline}," Hoyer said, referring to
multilateralism. However, "[we live in a **global
system**]{.underline}," said Robert Zoellick, former president of the
World Bank and a member of the Atlantic Council's International Advisory
Board, adding, "[no matter **how powerful**]{.underline} a country [you
are, it **helps to have friends**]{.underline}, too." Hoyer and Zoellick
spoke at an event, hosted by the Atlantic Council's Global Business and
Economics program as part of its EuroGrowth Initiative, to discuss the
role multilateral institutions can play in promoting international
prosperity and security. Frederick Kempe, president and chief executive
officer of the Atlantic Council, moderated the discussion. In his
introductory remarks, Kempe described [the [myriad challenges]{.mark}
facing the international community]{.underline}---the increasing threat
of [**[terror]{.mark} attacks**, the rise of
**[populism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [**economic [stagnation]{.mark}**[,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially **[[protectionist]{.mark} trade
[policies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** "[All]{.underline} of this
[[demand]{.underline}]{.mark}s **[collaborative, rapid, and [global
response]{.mark}s]{.underline}**," said Kempe. "[That's where
**multilateral institutions** come in."]{.underline} Hoyer described how
the EIB was founded as an institution to serve all members of the
European Union, but also aid development projects around the world. At
the EIB, he said, "we believe in multilateralism and cooperating
structures because the European Union's success is built on that." Kempe
said: "[multilateralism is the **gears**, the **workings**, the
**ending**]{.underline} [of so much of what goes on in the
world]{.underline}." However, he said, "[while arguably more important
than ever, it's purpose is called into question]{.underline}." [In the
midst of]{.underline} discussion surrounding the French elections,
labelled by **[Le Pen]{.underline}** as a "referendum on globalization,"
[and]{.underline} the questions raised by US President Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}** regarding the value of international
cooperation, [the **future of multilateral institutions**]{.underline}
[is at a **crossroads**]{.underline}, according to Kempe. "I think it's
fine for people to debate that," said Zoellick. However, using the
[rhetoric]{.underline} of Trump as an example, Zoellick said that he
"[starts from a very mistaken perspective that it's a **zero-sum
game**]{.underline}; that if you're serving the international system,
you're not serving the United States." Trump has criticized
international institutions such as NATO and the EU, as well as
multilateral trade deals, questioning the value-added benefits for the
United States, and "pitting nationalism against internationalism,"
Zoellick said. "The danger here is that [it's a totally mistaken
economic line]{.underline}," he said, warning that "[it'll lead to
mistaken approaches because you are trying to solve the wrong
problem]{.underline}." "[It also means you're missing the **next-tier
issues**]{.underline}," Zoellick added, referring to China as an
emerging player on the world stage. "[There's opportunities for China to
gain, but if we're trying to block our markets, that won't
happen]{.underline}," he said, insisting that both [the United States
and Europe must focus on **cooperative, rather than mutually
destructive, approaches**]{.underline} to the global system. "The tricky
thing with international agreements is that you are easily accused of
selling your national sovereignty," said Hoyer. He insisted that leaders
must find a way to convince their people that nations are stronger in
groups of countries that have organized their sovereignties together.
"[By simply walking away from a group of cooperating people, you don't
get stronger, you get more lonely]{.underline}," he said. "[We face
**monumental challenges**, and **only together can we surmount
them**]{.underline}," Hoyer earlier wrote in a blog post for the New
Atlanticist. "Though there's no denying that currently Europe has many
problems, it is still collectively convinced of the need to reach out
beyond its borders to other continents, to other peoples." Hoyer
expressed the hope that US President Donald Trump's visit to Europe will
be "an opportunity for our political leaders to be convincing enough
about the benefits of multilateralism." Trump will be in Brussels for
the NATO Summit on May 25. Zoellick described the benefits of
[international [institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly
financial institutions such as the World Bank, and the value-added
services they can provide in an integrated global system. He said that
the World Bank, of which he is a former president,
[[serve]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[as a **nucleus**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[of information [for]{.mark} **global [development]{.mark} projects**,
[can leverage]{.mark}]{.underline} funds to have a demonstrable impact
on such projects, and can use **[[capital]{.underline}]{.mark}** in an
innovative fashion. "People tend to think about \[multilateralism\] in
the way that people thought about development institutions when they
were founded," Zoellick said, adding "we're so far beyond that." Working
through multilateral institutions, "you also [[shape]{.underline}
**[ideas]{.underline}**]{.mark}," with the aim of [creating]{.underline}
**[new dynamics]{.underline}** that go beyond the institutions, he said.
According to Zoellick, the key to appreciating multilateral institutions
is "trying to understand that these banks and institutions [can [play a
**policy and catalytic role**]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather than just a
funding role." He pointed [[to]{.mark} the challenges of]{.underline}
[**[climate change]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[cyber
security]{.underline}**]{.mark} as areas where the EIB [and]{.underline}
World Bank [can play a **[significant]{.mark} role [in mitigating global
threats]{.mark}.**]{.underline} "[This is where the international system
has to continue to evolve; we're **not done with these
issues**]{.underline}," he said.

U.S. leaders have been seemingly unconcerned about [the]{.underline}
increasingly bellicose and militarily superior ["**New
Axis**"]{.underline} powers aligning against it since the end of the
Cold War. This alliance by America's two most powerful adversaries is
not a recent development. The Russian Federation and the People's
Republic of China formed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in June
2001. Russian president Vladimir Putin has since described it as "a
reborn Second Warsaw Pact." Russia and China now lead a military
alliance that includes over 68 percent of the landmass of Eurasia,
nearly 42 percent of the world's population, nearly 30 percent of the
world's GDP, and approximately 75 percent of the world's operational
nuclear weapons, with over two-thirds of them deployed by Russia.

[Russia developed **super-electromagnetic pulse weapons**]{.underline}
more than two decades ago. [These]{.underline} nuclear weapons are
designed to [greatly enhance their EMP effects. It]{.underline}
subsequently [shared this]{.underline} deadly [tech]{.underline}nology
[with its Chinese]{.underline} and North Korean [allies]{.underline}.
More recently, [Russia, China, and North Korea have been assessed as
likely having the capability to use **EMP** and
**cyberwarfare**]{.underline} attacks [to shut down America's
**electrical power grid**]{.underline} and other critical
infrastructure, [including the internet, financial systems,
transportation systems, food, and water distribution systems,
communications systems and emergency services in a matter of
minutes]{.underline}. Such attacks could possibly disable the Global
Positioning System and military early-warning satellites, blinding
Americans to subsequent attacks against the United States and its
allies. [U.S.]{.underline} military [leaders have even expressed concern
that our **nuclear command, control, and communications system** might
be **vulnerable to cyberattack**]{.underline}. Such an attack could
disrupt the president's ability to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike.
Also, [it could prevent America's conventional military forces from
being able to communicate with their commanders or coordinate their
attacks, making them much easier to defeat.]{.underline} The United
States has yet to develop any super-EMP weapons to help deter any such
attack.

President Joe Biden was elected, in part, on a platform of protecting
the environment from global climate change. However, few people realize
that [a super-EMP or cyberattack]{.underline} on the U.S. homeland
[would likely be far more catastrophic for **American citizens and the
environment**. Such an attack could cause all **ninety-four nuclear
reactors**]{.underline} in the United States to meltdown, [spreading
radioactive contamination and fallout to nearby cities]{.underline}. If
such an attack were to occur, then U.S. [leaders might not be certain
**which country attacked**]{.underline} us [or **who to retaliate
against**]{.underline}. In 2008, the Congressional EMP Commission
estimated that [such a cataclysmic attack on a national scale could
cause up to **90 percent of Americans to die**]{.underline} within
twelve months due to starvation, disease, and societal breakdown. A
comprehensive cyberattack on the U.S. homeland could also kill tens of
millions of Americans. Given their destructive potential, U.S. national
security professionals should seriously consider reclassifying cyber and
EMP weapons as weapons of mass destruction. Despite these warnings, U.S.
leaders have done little to protect the American people from EMP and
cyberattacks. They have also failed to deploy a national missile defense
system to protect against nuclear missile attacks. In the event of a
catastrophic Sino-Russian attack against the U.S. homeland, there is a
good chance that even [America's allies would **decline to come to its
defense**]{.underline} for fear of sharing its fate.

How did America's leaders allow the country to become so vulnerable?
U.S. leaders began a policy of nuclear disarmament at a pace far
exceeding Russia's following the end of the Cold War, naively believing
the existential threat had passed. This exposed the United States to
unnecessary and increasingly intolerable risks. By 2016, the U.S.
nuclear arsenal had been reduced from 30,000 nuclear weapons to only
1,750 operational warheads. Many of these weapons are deployed on aging
delivery systems of increasingly questionable reliability. Today, only
720 of America's warheads are ready to launch at any given time, of
which 50 percent would likely survive a full-scale nuclear first strike.
The reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile is also a major concern.
Successive administrations have failed to ensure it will function as
designed in the event of a crisis.

In August, Koffler wrote in an op-ed for The Hill that,

[Moscow is prepared to fight a **nuclear war**]{.underline} over its
perceived sphere of influence, on which Russia has relied for centuries
as its strategic security perimeter\... The Kremlin envisions fighting a
limited nuclear war with Washington, over contested areas such as
Ukraine and Crimea, the latter of which Russia illegally annexed in
2014\... Moscow also has conducted mock nuclear attacks on the U.S.
homeland. The Russians regularly practice nuclear launches in simulation
exercises, with Putin "pressing the button." \... [There is no question
that Russia is preparing for a nuclear conflict with the United States
and NATO.]{.underline} The only question is whether this conflict can be
deterred or fought.

Meanwhile, U.S. satellite imagery has revealed that China is in the
process of rapidly expanding its strategic nuclear arsenal by up to
4,000 warheads\--a number of nuclear warheads up to twenty times greater
than recent U.S. Department of Defense estimates of the size of their
entire nuclear arsenal. Peter Huessy recently noted in an op-ed
published by the National Interest that "U.S. satellites have discovered
some 350-400 new Chinese missile silos, each laid out in a grid pattern
some three kilometers apart. These new intercontinental
ballistic-missile 'launchers' are designed to hold the DF-41 missile."

"The DF-41 is a ten-warhead missile," Huessy explained. "Added up, [the
Chinese potential sprint to nuclear superiority may indeed be
**materializing**]{.underline}, a possible four-thousand warhead build
that would be 266 percent of the total deployed warheads currently in
the U.S. nuclear arsenal. More worrisome, China's future nuclear force
could be 400 percent of today's U.S. alert nuclear forces. \...
Alongside China, America's two nuclear-armed enemies would have combined
strategic nuclear warheads some 600 percent greater than the United
States. If compared by the number of nuclear weapons that are on alert
on a day-to-day basis, the imbalance reaches on the order of 1,000
percent."

Huessy estimates that [Russia and China could field a combined force of
9,000 deployed strategic nuclear warheads]{.underline} within the next
few years, 7,200 of which will be on alert and ready to fire at any
given time. Based on the time it took the United States to build its own
missile silos during the Cold War, [China could complete the
construction of its four hundred DF-41]{.underline} intercontinental
ballistic missile ([ICBM]{.underline}) [silos]{.underline} in as little
as two years. However, given the rapid pace of their construction, it's
possible they could finish them even sooner. Last month, Adm. Charles
Richard, that commander of U.S. Strategic Command, said that America was
"witnessing a strategic breakout by China." "The explosive growth in
their nuclear and conventional forces can only be what I described as
breathtaking. \... Frankly, that word 'breathtaking' may not be enough,"
he said. Richard characterized China as a "peer" nuclear competitor and
noted that we now face two nuclear "peer" competitors, Russia and China,
compared to one during the Cold War. Air Force Gen. John Hyten, the vice
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed Richard's assessment.

"It is going to take us 10 to 15 years to modernize 400 silos that
already exist," Hyten said. "And China is basically building almost that
many overnight. So the speed of difference in that threat is what really
concerns me most. \... Why are they building that enormous, enormous
nuclear capability faster than anybody in the world? \... [It's the
almost **unprecedented nuclear modernization**]{.underline}. \... They
could put, you know, ten reentry vehicles on every one of those ICBMs if
they wanted to; There's nothing to limit that ability."

[Despite]{.underline} the [increasing Sino-Russian nuclear superiority,
the U.S. government currently has no plans to increase the size of
the]{.underline} U.S. nuclear [arsenal]{.underline}, let alone restore
"rough nuclear parity" with Russia and China along with our ability to
credibly deter a nuclear/cyber/EMP attack on the U.S. homeland. As a
result of the growing disparity between Sino-Russian unconventional
warfare capabilities and those of the United States, the [chances of an
unconventional nuclear/EMP/cyberattack on the U.S. homeland
have]{.underline}, arguably, **[never been greater]{.underline}**.

The result of nuclear superiority could be calamitous. John Mearsheimer
writes in his book The Tragedy of Great Power Politics:

> In the unlikely event that [one state gained nuclear
> superiority]{.underline} over all of its rivals[, it would be so
> powerful that it would be the **only great power** in the system. The
> balance of conventional forces would be **largely
> irrelevant**]{.underline} if a nuclear hegemon were to emerge.

[The combined]{.underline} nuclear [arsenal]{.underline} of Russia and
China [is already estimated to constitute nearly twice as many deployed
strategic nuclear warheads]{.underline} as the United States. [If the
Sino-Russian alliance achieved anywhere near]{.underline} the 600
percent greater [level]{.underline} that Huessy [predicted]{.underline},
then [the two countries would be the **only remaining nuclear
hegemons**]{.underline}. The relative size of America's conventional
military would make no difference to deterring their aggression.
America's leaders must act quickly to prevent this from happening.

Cyberthreat: Nuclear EMP Attack,"

I am going to talk about [a dimension]{.underline} of the cyber threat
that is not usually considered a cyber threat in Western doctrine, but
is [in the playbooks for an Information Warfare Operation of Russia,
China]{.underline}, North Korea, and Iran. [These potential
adversaries]{.underline} in their military doctrines
[include]{.underline} as a dimension of cyber warfare a wide spectrum of
operations beyond computer viruses, including sabotage and kinetic
attacks, up to and including nuclear electromagnetic pulse
(**[EMP]{.underline}**) attack.

It is vitally important that we understand that a nuclear EMP attack is
part of cyber and information warfare operations as conceived by our
potential adversaries. [Our cyber doctrine must be designed to
**deter**]{.underline} and defeat the cyber doctrines of our potential
adversaries by anticipating how they plan to attack us\--but [our
doctrine **currently does not**.]{.underline}

[Our cyber and information warfare doctrines are
**dangerously**]{.underline} \[**[unaware]{.underline}**\] ~~blind~~ [to
the likelihood that a potential adversary making an all-out]{.underline}
information [warfare campaign designed to]{.underline}
\[**[debilitate]{.underline}**\] ~~cripple~~ [U.S. **critical
infrastructures** would include an **EMP attack**]{.underline}.

The assessment that nuclear EMP attack is included in the cyber and
information warfare doctrine of potential adversaries, and the effects
of an EMP attack described here, are based on the work of the
Congressional EMP Commission that analyzed this threat for nearly a
decade (2001-2008). The Congressional Strategic Posture Commission and
several other major U.S. Government studies independently arrived at
similar conclusions, [and represent collectively a **scientific and
strategic consensus**]{.underline} [that nuclear EMP attack upon the
United States is an **existential threat**.]{.underline}

What is EMP? A nuclear weapon detonated at high-altitude, above 30
kilometers, will generate an electromagnetic pulse that can be likened
to a super-energetic radio wave, more powerful than lightning, that can
destroy and disrupt electronics across a broad geographic area, from the
line of sight from the high-altitude detonation to the horizon.

For example, [a]{.underline} nuclear [weapon detonated]{.underline} at
an altitude of 30 kilometers would project an EMP field with a radius on
the ground of about 600 kilometers, that [could cover all the **New
England States**]{.underline}, **[New York]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Pennsylvania]{.underline}**, [damaging electronics
across this **entire region**]{.underline}, including electronics on
aircraft flying across the region at the time of the EMP attack.
[The]{.underline} EMP attack would [blackout at least the regional
electric grid, and probably the entire Eastern Grid that generates **70
percent of U.S. electricity**]{.underline}, for a protracted period of
weeks, months, possibly years. [The]{.underline} blackout and EMP
[damage]{.underline} beyond the electric grid in other systems [would
collapse all the other **critical infrastructures**\--communications,
transportation, banking and finance, food and water\--that **sustain
modern civilization**]{.underline} and the lives of millions.

Such an EMP attack, a nuclear detonation over the U.S. East Coast at an
altitude of 30 kilometers, could be achieved by lofting the warhead with
a meteorological balloon.

A more ambitious EMP attack could use -a freighter to launch a
medium-range missile from the Gulf of Mexico, to detonate a nuclear
warhead over the geographic center of the United States at an altitude
of 400 kilometers. The EMP field would extend to a radius of 2,200
kilometers on the ground, covering all of the contiguous 48 United
States, causing a nationwide blackout and collapse of the critical
infrastructures everywhere. All of this would result from the high-
altitude detonation of a single nuclear warhead.

The Congressional EMP Commission warned that Iran appears to have
practiced exactly this scenario. Iran has demonstrated the capability to
launch a ballistic missile from a vessel at sea. Iran has also several
times practiced and demonstrated the capability to detonate a warhead on
its medium-range Shahab III ballistic missile at the high-altitudes
necessary for an EMP attack on the entire United States. The Shahab III
is a mobile missile, a characteristic that makes it more suitable for
launching from the hold of a freighter. Launching an EMP attack from a
ship off the U.S. coast could enable the aggressor to remain anonymous
and unidentified, and so escape U.S. retaliation.

The Congressional EMP Commission warned that Iran in military doctrinal
writings explicitly describes making a nuclear EMP attack to eliminate
the United States as an actor on the world stage as part of an
Information Warfare Operation. For example, various Iranian doctrinal
writings on information and cyber warfare make the following assertions:

\* \"Nuclear weapons\...can be used to determine the outcome of a
war\...without inflicting serious human damage \[by neutralizing\]
strategic and information networks.\"

\* \"Terrorist information warfare \[includes\]\...using the technology
of directed energy weapons (DEW) or electromagnetic pulse (EMP).\"

\* \"\...today when you disable a country\'s military high command
through disruption of communications you will, in effect, disrupt all
the affairs of that country\....If the world\'s industrial countries
fail to devise effective ways to defend themselves against dangerous
electronic assaults, then they will disintegrate within a few years.\"

[China\'s premier military textbook on information warfare]{.underline},
written by China\'s foremost expert on cyber and information warfare
doctrine, [makes **unmistakably**]{.underline} clear that [China\'s
version of an allout Information Warfare Operation includes]{.underline}
both computer viruses and **[nuclear EMP attack]{.underline}**.
According to People\'s Liberation Army textbook World War, [the **Third
World War**]{.underline}\--Total Information Warfare, written by Shen
Weiguang, \"Therefore, [China should focus on measures to
counter]{.underline} computer viruses, [nuclear electromagnetic
pulse]{.underline}\...[and **quickly achieve breakthroughs** in those
technologies]{.underline}\...\":

[With their **massive destructiveness**]{.underline}, long-range nuclear
[weapons]{.underline} have [combined with highly sophisticated
information technology and information warfare under nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}\....Information war and traditional war have one
thing in common, namely that the country which possesses the critical
weapons such as atomic bombs will have \"first strike\" and \"second
strike retaliation\" capabilities \....[As soon as its computer networks
come under attack and are destroyed, the country will slip into a state
of]{.underline} \[**[unawareness]{.underline}**\] paralysis [and the
lives of its people will **ground to a halt**]{.underline}. Therefore,
China should focus on measures to counter computer viruses, nuclear
electromagnetic pulse\...and quickly achieve breakthroughs in those
technologies in order to equip China without delay with equivalent
deterrence that will enable it to stand up to the military powers in the
information age and neutralize and check the deterrence of Western
powers, including the United States. North Korea appears to be
attempting to implement the information warfare doctrine described above
by developing a long range missile capable of making a catastrophic
nuclear EMP attack on the United States. In December 2012, North Korea
demonstrated the capability to launch a satellite on a polar orbit
circling the Earth at an altitude of 500 kilometers. An altitude of 500
kilometers would be ideal for making an EMP attack that places the field
over the entire contiguous 48 United States, using an inaccurate
satellite warhead for delivery, likely to miss its horizontal aimpoint
over the geographic center of the U.S. by tens of kilometers. North
Korea\'s satellite did not pass over the United States\--but a slight
adjustment in its trajectory would have flown it over or near the U.S.
bull\'s eye for a high-altitude EMP burst.

Homeland Security, Director of the United States Nuclear Strategy Forum,
"Nuclear EMP Attack Scenarios and Combined-Arms Cyber Warfare," 2017,

A final worst-case scenario would be [**coordinated** EMP attacks by
**Russia**]{.underline}, **[China]{.underline}**, North Korea, and Iran
[to **advance their common global strategic and ideological
interests**]{.underline} [by what would amount to an **EMP World War**.
Is a nuclear world war implausible? Russia]{.underline} apparently
**[does not think so]{.underline}**, according to international and
Russian press in October 2016:

\"Russia is holding a massive evacuation drill for more than 40 million
people to prepare for nuclear war. More than 200,000 emergency services
personnel and soldiers will use 50,000pieces of equipment during the
massive civil defense 101 exercise.

[What are the common strategic and ideological interests of a **New
Axis**]{.underline} comprising Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran?

Strategically, [these states are all **dissatisfied** with the
established world order dominated by the United States and its
allies]{.underline}. Like Germany before World Wars I and II, they
perceive themselves as threatened, victim nations, hemmed in
territorially and economically by an international system built by rival
powers. [Moscow, Beijing]{.underline}, Pyongyang, and Tehran [would all
like to **overthrow the existing world order**]{.underline} and replace
it with a new world order---dominated by themselves.

[All also see \"the world\'s only superpower\" that is the United States
as the **greatest threat**]{.underline} to their existence. No matter
how benign the U.S. really is, they do not, perhaps cannot, see anything
but that the U.S. is a great potential threat. [The New Axis are what
might be called \"**national security states**\"]{.underline} or
\"militant dictatorships\" because they are [obsessed with
**survival**]{.underline} and dominance to the point of sacrificing
prosperity. Co-existence might be a temporary necessity. But real
security is achieved by dominance, by the annihilation of rivals, a view
like that in organized crime. An unsurprising parallel, as these are
criminal states.

Ideologically, contrary to common Western assumptions, these
\"outsider\" states do not perceive the United States and the West as
necessary to their prosperity, but as impediments actively hostile to
their existence. Totalitarian and authoritarian societies see politics
and economics, power and wealth, as a zero-sum game. Russia, China,
North Korea, and Iran do not blame themselves for their economic and
political problems---they blame the U.S. and the West.

Moreover, they fear the free political, economic, and cultural systems
represented by the United States and the West, so alien and
diametrically opposed to their own totalitarian and authoritarian
systems. Like ancient militarist Sparta, in its war with democratic
Athens, that made common cause against Athens with all other city states
run by tyrants, the elites of Moscow, Beijing, Pyongyang, and Tehran are
united by their fear and hatred of freedom.

Evidence is substantial that Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran are
tacit allies. [Russia and China conduct **military exercises together**,
support each other at the **UN**, and typically have a united
front]{.underline} on most international issues. [China\'s new and
growing military power is largely built on Russian technology. Russia
and China have both helped North Korea and Iran\'s nuclear and missile
programs, and often protect them from sanctions at the UN.]{.underline}

Is it a coincidence that all four of these powers are now embarked on
major acts of aggression in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East that
challenge international law and the existing world
order---simultaneously?

[An EMP World War might **unfold**]{.underline} by sequencing the
already described theater EMP scenarios [as follows:]{.underline}

• Iran Strikes Israel comes first, while Russia, China, and North Korea
wait for U.S. forces to concentrate in the Persian Gulf. The U.S.
military is now so diminished by cuts in budget, material, and manpower
that it can no longer fight more than one big theater war. After perhaps
a week, when U.S. forces and crucial C3I assets are committed and en
route to the Middle East, simultaneously or in rapid succession:

• North Korea Strikes South Korea and Japan

• [China Strikes **Taiwan**]{.underline}

• [Russia **Strikes European NATO**]{.underline}

Finally, if necessary:

• North Korea Strikes the United States

• [Russia **Strikes the United States**]{.underline}

[This sequencing of EMP attacks would **maximally exploit the U.S.
\"hollow\" military**. Where the U.S. is no longer able to support major
military operations in **more than one theater**, the]{.underline}
proposed [plan would confront the U.S. nearly **simultaneously with an
EMP World War**]{.underline} in four theaters---in five theaters if the
U.S. itself is attacked.

[EMP is]{.underline} essentially an anti-technology weapon---and perhaps
[the **perfect \"silver bullet\"**]{.underline} [to defeat and humble
the high-tech military of the United States]{.underline} that is the
basis for its claim to be \"the world\'s only superpower.\"

Hypersonic Weapons and the Changing Calculus of Battle\", *Arms Control

Escalation Risks and 'Entanglement' [Many weapons can be employed
for]{.underline} offensive and [**defensive purposes**, but
**[hypersonic]{.mark}**]{.underline} weapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
especially those designed for use in a regional context, [[are]{.mark}
primarily [intended to]{.mark} be used **offensively**]{.underline}, [to
[destroy]{.mark} high-value enemy assets, including
**[c]{.mark}ommand-and-[c]{.mark}ontrol
[facilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[This raises]{.mark} two major
concerns: [the risk of **rapid escalation**]{.mark} from a **minor**
crisis to a **full-blown war** and the unintended escalation from
**conventional** [to **nuclear war**]{.mark}**fare.**]{.underline} That
hypersonic weapons are being designed for offensive use at an early
stage in a conflict has been evident in U.S. strategic policy from the
beginning. Claiming that a major adversary might try to hide or move
critical assets at the outbreak of a crisis to protect them from U.S.
air and missile strikes, the Pentagon hoped the prompt global-strike
program would enable U.S. forces to attack those targets with minimal
warning. As this program got under way, hypersonic weapons became the
technology of choice for its implementation. "Systems that operate at
hypersonic speeds ... offer the potential for military operations from
longer ranges with shorter response times and enhanced effectiveness
compared to current military systems," states the U.S. Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency. Such munitions, it adds, "could provide
significant payoff for future U.S. offensive strike operations,
particularly as adversaries' capabilities advance."12 Most of the
hypersonic weapons being developed by the U.S. military, including the
Air Force cruise missile and the Navy's sea-launched system, are
intended for strikes against key enemy assets at an early stage of
conflict, when speed confers a significant advantage. Certain Russian
weapons, such as the Kinzhal, also seem intended for this purpose. Some
analysts fear that [[the **mere possession**]{.mark} [of such weapons
might]{.mark} induce leaders to escalate a military clash at the very
outbreak of a crisis---believing their early use will confer a
significant advantage in any major engagement that follows---while
**[reduc]{.mark}ing [the chances]{.mark}** [of keeping the fighting
**limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is easy to imagine, for example,
how [[a **clash**]{.mark} between U.S. and **Chinese naval
vessels**]{.underline} [[in the **S**]{.mark}**outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea**]{.underline}, accompanied by signs of an air and naval
mobilization on either or both sides, [[might prompt one]{.mark}
combatant [to launch a **barrage of hypersonic**
]{.mark}**weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} at all those ships and planes
and their command-and-control systems, hoping to prevent their use in
any full-scale encounter. This might make sense from a military
perspective, but would undoubtedly prompt a fierce counterreaction from
the injured side and restrict efforts to halt the fighting at a lower
level of violence. The introduction of hypersonic weapons also raises
concerns over the escalation from conventional to nuclear warfare. The
United States has focused primarily on the development of hypersonic
weapons carrying conventional warheads, but there is no fundamental
reason why they could not be nuclear armed. Indeed, Russia's Avangard
missile is intended to deliver a nuclear warhead, and it is assumed that
China's DF-ZF is also designed with this in mind. [[This leads
to]{.mark} what is]{.underline} called "**[[warhead
ambiguity]{.underline}]{.mark}**": [the risk that [a **defending
nation**]{.mark}, aware of an enemy's **hypersonic launch** and [having
**no time** to assess the warhead type, will **assume the worst** and
**launch**]{.mark}]{.underline} its own **[[nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**.13 Concern over this risk has led the
U.S. Congress to bar funding for the development of ICBM-launched
hypersonic glide vehicles, thereby helping to propel the Pentagon's
shift away from such systems and toward the development of medium-range
weapons more suitable for use in a regional context. Nevertheless,
warhead ambiguity will remain a feature of any future landscape
involving the deployment of multiple hypersonic weapons, as a defender
will never be certain that an enemy's assault is entirely non-nuclear.
[[With]{.underline}]{.mark} as little as [[**five minutes** to **assess
an attack**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[the time it would take a hypersonic
glide vehicle to traverse **2,000** **miles**]{.underline}---[a
[defender would be]{.mark} understandably [**hard pressed** to avoid
**worst-case assumptions**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Equally worrisome
is the danger of "target ambiguity": the possibility that a hypersonic
attack, even if conducted with missiles known to be armed only with
conventional warheads, would endanger the early-warning and
command-and-control systems a defender uses for its nuclear and
conventional forces, leading it to fear the onset of a nuclear attack.
[This is [especially dangerous in light of]{.mark}]{.underline} what
James Acton, a security analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, calls the "**[[entanglement]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
problem. Although almost everything involving nuclear decision-making is
secret, the [**nuclear** and **conventional command-and-control
systems** of the major powers are **widely assumed** to be
**interconnected**, or **entangled**, [making it difficult to]{.mark}
**clearly [distinguish]{.mark}** []{.mark}**one** from
**another**]{.underline}. Therefore, [**[any]{.mark}** [attack on
c]{.mark}ommand-and-[c]{.mark}ontrol [facilities]{.mark} at the onset of
crisis, **however intended**, [could be interpreted]{.mark} by the
defender [as a prelude to a **nuclear**]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than
a conventional **[[attack]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and prompt the
defender to **launch**]{.underline} its own **[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** before they are destroyed by an anticipated
barrage of enemy bombs and missiles.14 All this points to yet another
concern related to the impact of emerging technologies on the future
battlefield: the risk that nuclear-armed nations, fearing scenarios of
just this sort, will entrust more and more of their critical
decision-making to machines, fearing that humans will not be able to
make reasoned judgments under such enormous time pressures. With
hypersonic weapons in the arsenals of the major powers, [military
leaders may conclude that sophisticated]{.underline} artificial
intelligence (**[AI]{.underline}**) **[systems]{.underline}** [should be
empowered to determine the **nature of future missile attacks** and
select the **appropriate response**. This is a temptation that can only
increase as hypersonic weapons are themselves equipped with AI
systems]{.underline}, a capability being developed at Sandia National
Laboratories, enabling them to select and navigate to an array of
potential targets.15 This convergence of advanced technologies is one of
the greatest concerns of analysts who fear the loss of human control
over the pace of combat. Paul [Scharre]{.underline}, a program director
at the Center for a New American Security, [has warned of [a "**flash
war**"]{.mark}]{.underline} erupting [[when machines
**misinterpret**]{.mark} radar [signals and
initiate]{.mark}]{.underline} catastrophic, possibly **[[nuclear
responses]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "Competitive pressures in fast-paced
environments threaten to push humans further and further out of the
loop," he wrote. "With this arms race in speed come grave risks,"
[including]{.underline} "[a **war** that **spirals out of control** in
mere **seconds**]{.underline}."16

### RCA Impact\-\--Russia\-\--2NC 

#### The [alliance]{.underline}, not [internal Russian psychology]{.underline}, drives revisionism. 

Hiroyuki **Akita 22**, 5-11-22, "Russia\'s potential subordination to
China poses threat,"
<https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Comment/Russia-s-potential-subordination-to-China-poses-threat>,
jy

The power balance between the two is already far from equal. Russia\'s
gross domestic product is just one-tenth of China\'s. Russia sends about
15% of its exports to China, while relying on its neighbor for around
23% of its imports, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity,
an American research group.

Even [closer ties]{.underline} between Beijing and Moscow [could be a
bigger concern for the rest of the world than **even the \"axis of
evil,\"**]{.underline} [a term used by]{.underline} former U.S.
President George W. [Bush in reference to No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea, [Iran and Iraq under]{.underline} the leadership of
Saddam [Hussein.]{.underline} That is because Russia has a large number
of nuclear missiles and a hefty capacity for cyberattacks.

In addition, Moscow\'s diplomatic influence cannot be taken lightly.
When the United Nations General Assembly voted in April on whether
Russia should be suspended from the U.N. Human Rights Council, 93
countries voted in favor and 82 abstained or voted against.

[If Russia becomes **subordinate to China**, its pride as a big power
will be **wounded**]{.underline} and [it could start to suffer a **sense
of inferiority**]{.underline}, said a European government official long
involved in policy toward Moscow. [It could deepen Russia\'s **feeling
of paranoia**]{.underline} toward the Western bloc, [making it more
**belligerent and unpredictable**]{.underline}, the official said.

[Russian subordination to Beijing would also bring major changes to the
rivalry between the U.S. and China]{.underline}. With the eastern part
of Eurasia under its influence, [China would **quickly extend its sphere
of interest**]{.underline} [over Central Asia and
Afghanistan]{.underline}.

British political geographer Halford Mackinder called Central Asia and
Afghanistan \"the Heartland\" about a century ago, forecasting that a
country controlling the area would dominate the whole of Eurasia and the
world.

Britain and Russia vied for control over the region in the 19th and
early 20th centuries. When it comes to the current Sino-U.S. competition
for global hegemony, Russia\'s subservience would help China bolster its
position.

The security of Asia would be greatly affected as well. For example,
[China would likely call for more cooperation from Russia
over]{.underline} the questions of [the **Senkaku Islands** and
**Taiwan**]{.underline}.

The Putin administration has so far tried to maintain a neutral stance
on the Senkaku and Taiwan issues, according to an expert on Russian
diplomacy. That is because Russia wants to avoid confrontation with
Washington or Tokyo over Chinese disputes.

But [there is]{.underline} no guarantee [that Russia]{.underline} would
remain neutral [if it becomes more subordinate to China]{.underline}.
Although direct Russian military involvement in disputes involving the
Senkakus and the Taiwan Strait is unlikely, [the nation could indirectly
disturb Japanese and U.S. operations in favor of China]{.underline}.

\"We have to be more alert about Russian moves \[than before\] in case
of an emergency in Asia,\" said a Japanese government official in charge
of security.

With regard to how Russia is managed, the Putin administration is making
the country more like a giant version of North Korea \-- with both
nations relying on nuclear weapons for their security. Putin has been
consolidating his personal power, though not to the same extent as North
Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

[Putin\'s Russia repeatedly threatens the use of **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline} because it is no match for the U.S. in terms of
conventional arms. As is the case for North Korea, Russia is likely to
reinforce this tendency.

All this does not mean that Western countries should soften their stance
on Russia\'s continuing invasion of Ukraine. In the short term, the
invasion should be forced to end in failure by maximizing sanctions on
Russia.

To prevent Moscow from becoming subordinate to China, however, [nations
should leave room for **rebuilding relations** with]{.underline} a
post-Putin [Russia. They should **maintain connections with Russian
politicians**]{.underline} who remain aloof from Putin, while [boosting
efforts to provide the Russian public with accurate news and
information]{.underline}.

Putin should be brought to bay. But, at the same time, it is imperative
to avoid permanently darkening the geopolitical map.

future,\"

jy

VLADIMIR [Putin]{.underline} has [revealed a new alliance with **China**
to **create space weapons**]{.underline} [that could unleash
**havoc**]{.underline} in the West if its satellites were targeted.

Speaking at his annual news conference, the Russian strongman leader
said [the partnership was "strategic" amid **growing tensions with
NATO**.]{.underline}

As previously revealed by Sun Online, [Russian and Chinese space weapons
could **send the West into the Dark Ages** should it destroy
satellites]{.underline}.

It is feared an orbital onslaught [could shut down **hospitals**, crash
the **economy**, knock out **communications**, and cause **mass
blackouts**.]{.underline}

At his press conference today, Putin said: \"We cooperate with China in
the security area.

\"China's armed forces are equipped with the most advanced weapons
systems to a large extent.

"[We are even developing certain **high-tech types of weapons**. We are
working in **space**]{.underline}, aircraft areas."

[The]{.underline} revelation of the [alliance]{.underline} between
Russia and China [comes amid]{.underline} deepening concerns that
[Putin]{.underline} is plotting an invasion of his neighbour Ukraine in
2022 with more than 175,000 Russian troops said to have been detected on
the border.

But despite the massive build-up of forces, Putin insisted he did not
want a war with Ukraine.

He said: "We have [clearly and precisely let them know that any further
**NATO expansion**]{.underline} eastward [is
**unacceptable**."]{.underline}

Last week, Moscow submitted draft security documents demanding that NATO
deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll
back the alliance\'s military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe.

Putin said: "Is it us who are putting missiles near the US borders? No,
[it\'s the **US**]{.underline} [who came to our home with **their
missiles**]{.underline}.

"They are already on the threshold of our home. Is it some excessive
demand not to place any offensive systems near our home?

"What would the Americans think if we decided to come to the border
between Canada and the United States, or Mexico, and simply deploy our
own missiles over there."

Isabel Sawkins, a research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society
specialising in Russia, told The Sun Online that Russia and China
joining forces could \"potentially could be catastrophic\" for Western
powers.

She said: \"Bringing China into the conversation is a deadly addition
for the West.

\"This would mean America\'s standing in the world will be absolutely
shot to pieces.

\"[If you have Russia and China working together the US is going to go
into **absolute panic**]{.underline}."

\"Because [China]{.underline} is on its way up in the world. It\'s not
only a massive economy - they [have so **much power**]{.underline}.

\"You would have [**China working** with **Russia**]{.underline} and
them both [having this **anxiety over the West**]{.underline} - and
[that brings them together]{.underline}. That\'s a really terrifying
prospect.\"

Meanwhile experts told The Sun Online warned Chinese and Russian [space
weapons could plunge the **West into the Dark Ages**.]{.underline}

Power supplies, hospitals, businesses and transport networks could be
disrupted as satellites are lost leaving those under attack both
literally and figuratively in the dark.

British military chiefs have previously warned there could be [an attack
from space within the **next two years**]{.underline} - something which
has also been [dubbed a potential \"**Pearl Harbor in
space**\"]{.underline} for the US.

Allen Antrobus, a military space expert at Airbus Defence and Space in
Stevenage, Herts, told The Sun Online he \"absolutely\" believed [there
was an **increased threat of an attack in space**]{.underline}.

[His warnings echo]{.underline} those of other [experts who
fear]{.underline} that [Britain is at risk of \"**an economic
blackout**]{.underline} of frightening proportions\".

Space industry body UKspace admitted [firms have **very little ability
to defend**]{.underline} key data and infrastructure should the West
come under attack from space.

#### Most likely scenario for extinction.

[The world's most worrisome military flashpoint is]{.underline} arguably
[not]{.underline} in the Strait of **[Taiwan]{.underline}**, the
[Korea]{.underline}n Peninsula, [Iran,]{.underline} [Israel, Kashmir or
Ukraine]{.underline}. In fact, it cannot be located on any map of Earth,
even though it is very easy to find. To see it, [just look up into a
**clear sky**]{.underline}, to the no-man's-land of Earth orbit, [where
a conflict is unfolding that is an **arms race** in all but
name.]{.underline}

The emptiness of [outer space might be the last place you'd
expect]{.underline} militaries to vie over contested territory, except
that outer space isn't so empty anymore. About [**1,300 active
satellites** wreathe the globe in a crowded nest of orbits]{.underline},
providing worldwide communications, GPS navigation, weather forecasting
and planetary surveillance. For militaries that rely on some of those
satellites for modern warfare, [space has become the **ultimate high
ground**]{.underline}, with the U.S. as the undisputed king of the hill.
Now, [as **China** and **Russia** aggressively seek to challenge U.S.
superiority in space with ambitious military space programs]{.underline}
of their own, the power struggle risks sparking a conflict [that
could]{.underline} ~~cripple~~ \[**[destroy]{.underline}**\] [**the
entire planet's** space-based infrastructure]{.underline}. And though it
might begin in space, [such]{.underline} a conflict [could **easily
ignite full-blown war on Earth**]{.underline}.

The [long-simmering tensions are now approaching a **boiling
point**]{.underline} due to several events, [including]{.underline}
recent and ongoing [tests of possible anti-satellite weapons by China
and Russia]{.underline}, as well as last month's failure of
tension-easing talks at the United Nations.

Testifying before Congress earlier this year, Director of National
Intelligence James Clapper echoed the concerns held by many senior
government officials about the growing threat to U.S. satellites, saying
that [China and Russia are both "developing capabilities to **deny
access in a conflict**]{.underline}," such as [those that might erupt
over China's military activities in the S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea [or Russia's in Ukraine.
China]{.underline} in particular, Clapper said, [has demonstrated "**the
need to interfere with**]{.underline}, damage and destroy" [U.S.
satellites]{.underline}, referring to a series of Chinese anti-satellite
missile tests that began in 2007.

There are many ways to disable or destroy satellites beyond
provocatively blowing them up with missiles. A spacecraft could simply
approach a satellite and spray paint over its optics, or manually snap
off its communications antennas, or destabilize its orbit. Lasers can be
used to temporarily disable or permanently damage a satellite's
components, particularly its delicate sensors, and radio or microwaves
can jam or hijack transmissions to or from ground controllers.

In response to these possible threats, the Obama administration has
budgeted at least \$5 billion to be spent over the next five years to
enhance both the defensive and offensive capabilities of the U.S.
military space program. The U.S. is also attempting to tackle the
problem through diplomacy, although with minimal success; in late July
at the United Nations, long-awaited discussions stalled on a European
Union-drafted code of conduct for spacefaring nations due to opposition
from Russia, China and several other countries including Brazil, India,
South Africa and Iran. The failure has placed diplomatic solutions for
the growing threat in limbo, likely leading to years of further debate
within the UN's General Assembly.

"The bottom line is the United States does not want conflict in outer
space," says Frank Rose, assistant secretary of state for arms control,
verification and compliance, who has led American diplomatic efforts to
prevent a space arms race. The U.S., he says, is willing to work with
Russia and China to keep space secure. "But let me make it very clear:
we will defend our space assets if attacked."

Offensive space weapons tested

The prospect of war in space is not new. Fearing Soviet nuclear weapons
launched from orbit, the U.S. began testing anti-satellite weaponry in
the late 1950s. It even tested nuclear bombs in space before orbital
weapons of mass destruction were banned through the United Nations'
Outer Space Treaty of 1967. After the ban, space-based surveillance
became a crucial component of the Cold War, with satellites serving as
one part of elaborate early-warning systems on alert for the deployment
or launch of ground-based nuclear weapons. Throughout most of the Cold
War, the U.S.S.R. developed and tested "space mines," self-detonating
spacecraft that could seek and destroy U.S. spy satellites by peppering
them with shrapnel. In the 1980s, the militarization of space peaked
with the Reagan administration's multibillion-dollar Strategic Defense
Initiative, dubbed Star Wars, to develop orbital countermeasures against
Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles. And in 1985, the U.S. Air
Force staged a clear demonstration of its formidable capabilities, when
an F-15 fighter jet launched a missile that took out a failing U.S.
satellite in low-Earth orbit.

Through it all, no full-blown arms race or direct conflicts erupted.
According to Michael Krepon, an arms-control expert and co-founder of
the Stimson Center think tank in Washington, D.C., that was because
[both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. realized how vulnerable their satellites
were]{.underline}---particularly the ones in "geosynchronous" orbits of
about 35,000 kilometers or more. Such satellites effectively hover over
one spot on the planet, making them sitting ducks. But because any
hostile action against those satellites could easily escalate to a full
nuclear exchange on Earth, both superpowers backed down. "Neither one of
us signed a treaty about this," Krepon says. "We just independently came
to the conclusion that our security would be worse off if we went after
those satellites, because if one of us did it, then the other guy would,
too."

[**Today**, the situation is **much more complicated**. Low- and
high-Earth orbits have become **hotbeds of scientific and commercial
activity**]{.underline}, filled with hundreds upon hundreds of
satellites from about 60 different nations. Despite their largely
peaceful purposes, [each]{.underline} and every [satellite is **at
risk**]{.underline}, in part because not all members of the growing club
of military space powers are willing to play by the same rules---and
they don't have to, because the rules remain as yet unwritten.

**[Space junk]{.underline}** [is the **greatest threat**. Satellites
race through space at **very high velocities**, so the quickest,
dirtiest way to kill one is to simply launch something into space to get
in its way. Even the impact of an object as small]{.underline} and
low-tech [as a marble can disable or entirely destroy a billion-dollar
satellite.]{.underline} And [if a nation uses such a "kinetic" method to
destroy an adversary's satellite, it can easily create even **more
dangerous debris**, potentially cascading into a chain reaction that
**transforms Earth orbit** into a **demolition derby**]{.underline}.

In 2007 the risks from debris skyrocketed when China launched a missile
that destroyed one of its own weather satellites in low-Earth orbit.
That test generated a swarm of long-lived shrapnel that constitutes
nearly one-sixth of all the radar-trackable debris in orbit. The U.S.
responded in kind in 2008, repurposing a ship-launched anti-ballistic
missile to shoot down a malfunctioning U.S. military satellite shortly
before it tumbled into the atmosphere. That test produced dangerous junk
too, though in smaller amounts, and the debris was shorter-lived because
it was generated at a much lower altitude.

More recently, [China has launched what many experts say are
**additional tests**]{.underline} of ground-based anti-satellite kinetic
weapons. [None of these]{.underline} subsequent [launches have destroyed
satellites, but]{.underline} Krepon and [other experts say this is
because the Chinese are now merely **testing to miss**]{.underline},
rather than to hit, [with the same hostile capability as an end
resu]{.underline}lt. The latest test occurred on July 23 of last year.
Chinese officials insist the tests' only purpose is peaceful missile
defense and scientific experimentation. But one test in May 2013 sent a
missile soaring as high as 30,000 kilometers above Earth, approaching
the safe haven of strategic geosynchronous satellites.

That was a wake-up call, says Brian Weeden, a security analyst and
former Air Force officer who studied and helped publicize the Chinese
test. "The U.S. came to grips decades ago with the fact that its lower
orbit satellites could easily be shot down," Weeden says. "Going nearly
to geosynchronous made people realize that, holy cow, somebody might
actually try to go after the stuff we have up there."

It was no coincidence that shortly after the May 2013 test, the US
declassified details of its secret Geosynchronous Space Situational
Awareness Program (GSSAP), a planned set of four satellites capable of
monitoring the Earth's high orbits and even rendezvousing with other
satellites to inspect them up-close. The first two GSSAP spacecraft
launched into orbit in July 2014.

"This used to be a black program---something that didn't even officially
exist," Weeden says. "It was declassified to basically send a message
saying, 'Hey, if you're doing something funky in and around the
geosynchronous belt, we're going to see.'" An interloper into
geosynchronous orbit need not be an explosives-tipped missile to be a
security risk---even sidling up to an adversary's strategic satellites
is considered a threat. Which is one reason that potential U.S.
adversaries might be alarmed by the rendezvous capabilities of GSSAP and
of the U.S. Air Force's highly maneuverable X-37B robotic space planes.

[**Russia** is also developing its own ability to approach]{.underline},
inspect and potentially sabotage or destroy [satellites]{.underline} in
orbit. Over the past two years, it has included three mysterious
payloads in otherwise routine commercial satellite launches, with the
latest occurring in March of this year. Radar observations by the U.S.
Air Force and by amateur hobbyists revealed that after each commercial
satellite was deployed, an additional small object flew far away from
the jettisoned rocket booster, only to later turn around and fly back.
The objects, dubbed Kosmos-2491, -2499 and -2504, might just be part of
an innocuous program developing techniques to service and refuel old
satellites, Weeden says, though they could also be meant for more
sinister intentions.

Treaties offer little assurance

Chinese officials maintain that their military activities in space are
simply peaceful science experiments, while Russian officials have stayed
mostly mum. Both nations could be seen as simply responding to what they
see as the U.S.'s clandestine development of potential space weapons.
Indeed, the U.S.'s ballistic missile defense systems, its X-37B space
planes and even its GSSAP spacecraft, though all ostensibly devoted to
maintaining peace, could be easily repurposed into weapons of space war.
For years Russia and China have pushed for the ratification of a legally
binding United Nations treaty banning space weapons---a treaty that U.S.
officials and outside experts have repeatedly rejected as a disingenuous
nonstarter.

"The draft treaty from Russia and China seeks to ban the very things
that they are so actively pursuing," Krepon says. "It serves their
interests perfectly. They want freedom of action, and they're covering
that with this proposal to ban space weapons." Even if the treaty was
being offered in good faith, Krepon says, "it would be dead on arrival"
in Congress and would stand no chance of being ratified. After all, the
U.S. wants freedom of action in space, too, and in space no other
country has more capability---and thus more to lose.

According to Rose, there are three key problems with the treaty. "One,
it's not effectively verifiable, which the Russians and Chinese admit,"
he says. "You can't detect cheating. Two, it is totally silent on the
issue of terrestrial anti-satellite weapons, like the ones that China
tested in 2007 and again in July 2014. And third, it does not define
what a weapon in outer space is."

As an alternative, the U.S. supports a European-led initiative to
establish "norms" for proper behavior through the creation of a
voluntary International Code of Conduct for Outer Space. This would be a
first step, to be followed by a binding agreement. A draft of the
code---which Russia and China prevented from being adopted in last
month's UN discussions---calls for more transparency and
"confidence-building" between spacefaring nations as a way of promoting
the "peaceful exploration and use of outer space." This, it is hoped,
can prevent the generation of more debris and the further development of
space weapons. However, like [the Russian-Chinese treaty]{.underline},
the code [does not exactly define what constitutes a "space
weapon."]{.underline}

[That haziness poses **problems**]{.underline} for senior defense
officials such as General John Hyten, the head of the U.S. Air Force
Space Command. "Is our space-based surveillance system that looks out at
the heavens and tracks everything in geosynchronous a weapons system?"
he asks. "I think everybody in the world would look at that and say no.
But it's maneuverable, it's going 17,000 miles per hour, and it has a
sensor on board. It's not a weapon, okay? But would \[a treaty's\]
language ban our ability to do space-based surveillance? I would hope
not!"

Is war in space inevitable?

Meanwhil[e, shifts in U.S. policy are giving China and Russia **more
reasons for further suspicion**]{.underline}. Congress has been pressing
the U.S. national security community to turn its attentions to the role
of offensive rather than defensive capabilities, even dictating that
most of the fiscal year 2015 funding for the Pentagon's Space Security
and Defense Program go toward "development of offensive space control
and active defense strategies and capabilities."

"Offensive space control" is a clear reference to weapons. "Active
defense" is much more nebulous, and refers to undefined offensive
countermeasures that could be taken against an attacker, further
widening the routes by which space might soon become weaponized. If an
imminent threat is perceived, a satellite or its operators might
preemptively attack via dazzling lasers, jamming microwaves, kinetic
bombardment or any other number of possible methods.

"I hope to never fight a war in space," Hyten says. "[It's bad for the
world]{.underline}. Kinetic \[anti-satellite weaponry\] is horrible for
the world," [because of the **existential risks debris
poses**]{.underline} for all satellites. "But [if war does extend
into]{.underline} [space]{.underline}," he says, "[we have to have
offensive and defensive]{.underline} **[capabilities]{.underline}** to
respond with, and Congress has asked us to explore what those
capabilities would be. And to me, the one limiting factor is no debris.
Whatever you do, don't create debris."

Technology to jam transmissions, for example, appears to underpin the
Air Force's Counter Communications System, the U.S.'s sole acknowledged
offensive capability against satellites in space. "It\'s basically a big
antenna on a trailer, and how it actually works, what it actually does,
nobody knows," Weeden says, noting that, like most space security work,
the details of the system are top secret. "All we basically know is that
they could use it to somehow jam or maybe even spoof or hack into an
adversary's satellites."

For Krepon, the debate over the definitions of space weapons and the
saber-rattling between Russia, China and the U.S. is unhelpfully
eclipsing the more pressing issue of debris. "Everyone is talking about
purposeful, man-made objects dedicated to warfighting in space, and
[it's like we are **back in the Cold**]{.underline} War," Krepon says.
"Meanwhile, there are about 20,000 weapons already up there in the form
of debris. They're not purposeful---they're unguided. They're not
seeking out enemy satellites. They're just whizzing around, doing what
they do."

The space environment, he says, must be protected as a global commons,
similar to the Earth's oceans and atmosphere. Space junk is very easy to
make and very hard to clean up, so international efforts should focus on
preventing its creation. Beyond the threat of deliberate destruction,
the [risk of **accidental collisions**]{.underline} and debris strikes
[will **continue to grow**]{.underline} as more nations launch and
operate more satellites without rigorous international accountability
and oversight. And as the chance of accidents increases, [so too does
the possibility of their being misinterpreted as
**deliberate**]{.underline}, **[hostile actions]{.underline}** [in the
high-tension cloak-and-dagger military struggle in space]{.underline}.

"We are in the process of messing up space, and most people don't
realize it because we can't see it the way we can see fish kills, algal
blooms, or acid rain," he says. "To avoid trashing Earth orbit, [we
**need a sense of urgency**]{.underline} that currently no one has.
Maybe we'll get it when we can't get our satellite television and our
telecommunications, our global weather reports and hurricane
predictions. Maybe [when we get knocked back]{.underline} to the 1950s,
we'll get it. But by then [it **will be too late**]{.underline}."

The great power struggle for Venezuelan oil and gas, spheres of interest
The arguments concerning the miserable state of the Venezuelan people
serve "public consumption", because [[the **Venezuelan crisis** stems
from **great power struggle**]{.underline}]{.mark}, that is not aimed to
enhance the welfare of the Venezuelan people, but, above all,
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} retain/[**[gain control]{.underline}**
[over]{.underline}]{.mark} the fate of [[the world\'s
**largest**]{.underline}]{.mark} (!), known, traditional **[[oil
reserves]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Venezuelan leadership officially
denies the mere existence of a humanitarian crisis.9 This is supported
by evidence from recent reports of US journalists, when they reported on
a private store chain and state-subsidized (humanitarian) stores.10 11
[Venezuela is **ahead of Saudi**]{.underline} Arabia since 2010
[in]{.underline} terms of the quantity of [oil reserves]{.underline}. 12
The [Venezuelan]{.underline} oil [reserves amount]{.underline}ed [to
**297 billion barrels**]{.underline}, while the Saudi oil reserves in
2009 were around 267 billion barrels, according to data provided by
OPEC.13 With this, Venezuela has gained global leadership. At the same
time, it is noteworthy that the extraction of Venezuelan ultra-heavy oil
requires more sophisticated and expensive technology than the Saudi
light-oil. In addition, [Venezuela\'s **natural gas** reserves are
significant]{.underline}: in 2010, it had the world\'s 8th largest
conventional natural gas reserves. 14 95% of Venezuela\'s exports are
made up of hydrocarbons.15 Considering that the easy to extract
(technically simple and inexpensive to extract), traditional oil and gas
reserves are being systematically exhausted globally, there is bright
future for the Venezuelan and other ultra-heavy oil. It coincides with
the development of the utilisation of other, harder and more expensive
to extract resources in the future, such as shale-gas, shale-oil,
ultra-deep sea oil, oil sand etc. Venezuela benefited from US private
companies in terms of oil extraction technologies and required
investments in the 1980s and 1990s. The "deadly crime" against the
large, privately owned American oil companies was made by presidents
Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro, by ousting the US and supporting Russian
and Chinese investments. [**Russia and China** have **invested
increasingly**]{.underline} in the Venezuelan oil industry, providing
the necessary know-how and the technological background. Reliable,
official data on this cooperation is hardly available. According to a
Caracas analysis firm, at the end of 2015, Russian-Venezuelan oil
production was 209 000 barrels/day, while Chinese-Venezuelan production
reached 171 000 barrels/day. With this, Russia has overtaken China in
the fields of the Venezuelan oil investments and extraction
indicators.16 Igor Sechin, Rosneft 's CEO, had promised to invest \$17.6
billion in Venezuela's oil fields by 2019. Sechin's promise carried
authority: A former deputy prime minister, he has been a close ally of
Russian President Vladimir Putin for over 20 years, and until recently
was described as Russia's second most powerful person."17 As we have
already seen in the motto, some of the Russian oil-producing private
companies have already left Venezuela, while Rosneft, a Russian
state-owned company, has remained and takes development very seriously.
This leads to many conclusions. Private oil extraction companies that
had left Venezuela, considered the future of extraction to be risky,
since Venezuela could be returned to the US sphere of interest if Maduro
is overthrown. Russian companies would be expelled from Venezuelan oil
production as it happened to the US during the presidency of Chavez.
Private companies involved in oil extraction are afraid of the loss of
their capital, and their willingness to take risks is, is of course,
much smaller than that of the Russian state-owned oil-giant, Rosneft.
The fact that they do not know the plans of the Russian state for
Venezuela also contributes to the withdrawal of private companies. It
goes without saying that Sechin, known as Putin\'s loyal ally, knows
much more about the plans of the Russian state. There must be Russian
plans going beyond oil production, since the
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n state [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} already
[[invested]{.underline} **[tens of billions of]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[**US [dollars ]{.mark}**[in **Venezuelan oil
extraction**]{.mark}]{.underline}, knowing exactly that they and the
Chinese have penetrated an American sphere of interest. The latter is
inevitably a serious risk factor for Russia and China. The Russian and
Chinese share of Venezuelan oil production is somewhat constrained by
the 40% maximum available share of ownership18 (see Annex 1). The
restriction of the foreign ownership of oil extraction has different
advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that the Venezuelan state
remains the majority owner and thus the Venezuelan state itself can make
strategic decisions in terms of oil production. Allowing the Venezuelan
state to do so is also a matter of national sovereignty and national
security. At the same time, it may be a disadvantage that the Venezuelan
state does not master the technologies required for ultra-heavy oil
extraction, as Russian or Chinese companies do, which could lead to
disruptions in Venezuelan state-owned oil extraction. "Between 2012 and
2015, [Russia sold arms worth **\$ 3.2 billion** to
Venezuela]{.underline}, [which made Venezuela the world\'s **third
largest Russian weapon purchaser**]{.underline}." 19 With this,
Venezuela de facto left the US sphere of interest and joined that of
Russia and China. There is a great power struggle in Venezuela to keep
or gain control over significant fossil-originated resources, depending
on whether we consider Russian, Chinese, or US perspectives. It goes far
beyond the aspirations and possibilities of the Venezuelan people,
political elite, government, and parliament. While in the case of
Ukraine and Georgia, the US-led West entered Russia\'s sphere of
interest, in case of Venezuela, Russia and China penetrated the US
sphere of interest. Since the trio of great powers in these games have
systematically hindered each other\'s aspirations in each of the three
target countries (US support for the Ukrainian coup to overthrow
president Janukovich, Russian military intervention in Ukraine and
Georgia, the dismantling of RussianUkrainian and Russian-Georgian
economic relations, US economic sanctions against Venezuela and
companies wishing to trade with the country, the (British) denial to
give back the Venezuelan state-owned gold reserves, Venezuelan coup
attempts with active US and Western support, etc.) have caused a variety
of social shocks in all three target countries, not least resulting in
the deterioration of living standards and living conditions. Burning the
US humanitarian aid convoy on 23 February 2019 On 22 February 2019,
Maria Zakharova, the spokesperson of the Russian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, announced that the US humanitarian aid shipment scheduled for
23 February, delivered through Colombia to Venezuela, would be a
provocation.20: „Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said a
U.S. humanitarian aid convoy for Venezuela could provoke clashes and
create a pretext for removing President Nicolas Maduro, a staunch
Russian ally, by force", that was labelled by the US as "propaganda".21
The position of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs was, of course,
agreed with the Venezuelan government. President Maduro refused the
American humanitarian aid, claiming that it was a means of consciously
organized political hysteria, provocation, disinformation about
conditions in Venezuela, and it was a tool to overthrow him. „Maduro has
accused Washington of orchestrating a coup d'état in order to install a
puppet regime in Venezuela."22 The Venezuelan and Russian forecasts were
"well-proven": masked "activists" (thugs) set US humanitarian aid convoy
on fire when the trucks were on a bridge connecting Colombia with
Venezuela, prior to reaching Venezuelan territory. The chain of
accusations continued. US Secretary of State Pompeo made president
Maduro responsible for the incident claiming that Maduro\'s men were
responsible for setting the aid convoy on fire. According to Pompeo, the
incident demonstrated the cruelty and illegality of the Venezuelan
system. "We denounce Maduro's refusal to let humanitarian assistance
reach Venezuela. What kind of a sick tyrant stops food from getting to
hungry people? The images of burning trucks filled with aid are
sickening" -- claimed Pompeo.23 Following the incident, self-proclaimed
"interim president" Guaido and the president of Colombia held a press
conference in which they condemned Maduro because of the incident.
Venezuela rejected the charges and made Guaido\'s men responsible for
what happened. The US-Colombian and Venezuelan opposition positions
describing the incident are likely to be based on predetermined lies.
The shipment of USAID was escorted by the people of Guaido, and was set
on fired on the bridge before the shipment arrived to Venezuelan
territory. It was totally unrealistic, unlikely that Maduro\'s activists
could have invisibly "replaced" Guaido's activists, who ignited the
convoy. It is also unrealistic and unlikely, that Maduro's men
infiltrated Guaido's supporters, being able to ignite the entire convoy
without being beaten by activists supporting Guaido. It is obvious, that
the incident is perfectly suitable to put the blame on Maduro, who
"refuses and burns humanitarian aid", and not the US and Guaido "who
supply humanitarian aid to Venezuelan people in need". It is noteworthy
that the provocation was well anticipated by the Russian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs that officially predicted it. It is obvious, that if
Maduro plans a provocation, he would not inform adversaries in advance.
It is thought-provoking that if a state (in our case: Venezuela) does
not ask for assistance from another state, furthermore: refuses it, then
why it should be forced upon that state. According to the official
explanation from Washington is dead simple: that the interests of the
Venezuelan people were kept in mind. For those, who believe in this, I
would advise considering the faith of the 14 million people in Yemen,
who are literally starving to death, lacking clean water, medical
attention etc. Guaido's lie concerning the possible amount of people in
need in Venezuela, that is claimed to be around 300 000, is -- even if
it is true -- pale in comparison to what is going on in Yemen. The
bottom line is, that there is hysteria in Washington due to conditions
in Venezuela, and there is deafening silence concerning enormous
suffering in Yemen.24 At the same time, it would be naïve to believe
that if the Venezuelan government refuses help officially, the Americans
would still believe that the shipment could be delivered to the
Venezuelan people. At the same time, the need for conscious provocations
and hysteria against Maduro for the justification of a military attack
on Venezuela gives an in-depth explanation of why Washington forced (!)
"humanitarian assistance". In a new round of US aid accusations, Carlos
Rafael Faria Tortosa, Venezuela's ambassador in Moscow (!) accused the
US of delivering spoiled food and expired medicines, and the shipment
was not examined by any international organization.25 The last charge is
likely to be verifiable and true, the first two will be difficult to
prove once the shipment burned down. We might recall that Kiev has
criticised Moscow several times for deliveries of humanitarian aid to
Donetsk and Lugansk. Kiev claimed that the Russians did not really want
to help, but to smuggle soldiers, weapons and ammunition under the
disguise of aid deliveries. "Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko
described the entry of the trucks without Kiev's permission as a
"flagrant violation of international law"... Repeating earlier
suspicions by Kiev that the aid cargo could be somehow used to support
the separatists, the foreign ministry said: «Neither the Ukrainian side
nor the International Committee of the Red Cross knows the content of
the trucks. This arouses special concern.» The fact that Russian
vehicles had crossed into Ukraine without permission "testifies to the
deliberate and aggressive character of actions by the Russian side", the
ministry said ... "We consider this a direct invasion by Russia of
Ukraine," Ukrainian state security chief Valentyn Nalivaychenko
said..."26 Interestingly, the Russian reactions concerning the Ukrainian
statements are quite similar to that of the US referring to the
Venezuela humanitarian aid incident: "We warn against any attempts to
disrupt this purely humanitarian mission," the Russian foreign ministry
said. "Responsibility for any possible consequences of provocations ...
will lie, completely and entirely, with those who are prepared to
further sacrifice human lives for the sake of their ambitions and
geo-political ploys."27 Generally speaking, if a relief shipment comes
from a hostile country, it would be treated with mistrust and suspicion.
If it can be done, the host power would take action. However, our story
in Venezuela is entirely different. The possibilities of military
interventions [US and/or Russian **military interventions**]{.underline}
[in Venezuelan are]{.underline} fundamentally [determined by two
things]{.underline}: (a) [whether rival big powers can achieve their
goals **without** a military intervention]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} (b) ho**[w much Venezuelan oil]{.underline}**, gas
reserves and the weapon market [is **worth** for rival great
powers]{.underline}. There is no clear answer to the question (a) yet.
For the time being, attempts to overthrow president Maduro\'s power
seems to be unsuccessful, although this political game is far from being
over. We cannot be take seriously the promise of self-proclaimed
president Guaido that he will not touch the energy contracts that have
already been concluded, if he comes to power. Some analysts say that
time is working against president Maduro, while others say that the coup
attempt of US backed Guaido has failed and Maduro is still more popular
than Guaido. If the Gray Zone Project\'s US journalist Ben Norton\'s
data on the popularity of president Maduro are true, 86% of Venezuelans
oppose military intervention and 81% oppose economic sanctions against
Venezuela "to overthrow Maduro\'s system" (see Annex 4). This explains
many things. For example, it becomes clear why Guaido\'s coup attempt to
oust Maduro failed in a short time. It can be seen, why the Venezuelan
Armed Forces could have been a solid support for former, then president
Chavez and the system of president Maduro today. Obviously, the latter
question is not only dependent on which side the Venezuelan people are
on, but also on the fact that these two Venezuelan presidents and their
Russian and Chinese supporters have been very consciously struggling
over the years to recruit and maintain soldiers in the Venezuelan Armed
Forces, who are firm supporters of the power represented by the Chavez
and Maduro. It is no coincidence that US President Trump threatened
Venezuelan Armed Forces, that the continuation of their loyalty to
Maduro "threatens their future and life" (!).28 This is a classic and
rough form of open US intervention in Venezuelan internal affairs. The
answer to the question (b) is clear: **[[Venezuelan
oil]{.underline}]{.mark}** and gas reserves, the arms market
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, in general, [[the country\'s belonging to US
or Russian]{.underline}]{.mark}/[[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[sphere of interest]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[are worthy of **a
large-scale**]{.mark} **external [military
intervention]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For such a military intervention,
rival great powers can always find detailed political reasons to
convince public opinion around the world. [Russia has the possibility of
a legal armed intervention in Venezuela according to international law,
as the Venezuelan government may, if necessary, **formally request
it**.]{.underline} The same is true of a possible Chinese military
intervention, although this seems unlikely in the light of current
Chinese foreign policies. In the case of the US, a possible Venezuelan
military intervention lacks international legal conditions, as the UN
Security Council (UNSC) would not approve it as a result of the Russian
and Chinese vetoes (as a minimum), and there is neither a case of US
self-defence, nor a formal invitation by the Venezuelan government.
Guaido's formal invitation for a US military intervention cannot be
legitimized in terms of international law because of his "dubious" legal
status, since Guaido is a self-proclaimed "interim president",
officially recognized by the US and pro-US followers (that currently
includes 24 EU member states). **[Guaido]{.underline}** [asked the US to
examine "**all options on the table**".]{.underline} [This]{.underline}
term, on the one hand, **[matches]{.underline}** [the American political
dictionary used by Washington\'s leading politicians on a **regular
basis** and]{.underline}, on the other hand, literally [means that the
US must **seriously consider overthrowing president Maduro** with
**military force**.]{.underline} Although formally [Guaido]{.underline}
[did not ask the US to perform an **open military
intervention**]{.underline}, [he indicated that he would **support such
an option** if the appropriate decision is made]{.underline}. Otherwise,
he would have said that the US would look at all options "other than
military intervention". It would be an interesting, food-for-thought
experiment if a US Senator would ask Russia and/or China to seriously
consider "all options on the table" to overthrow the US president in
power and his social system. The Russians and the Chinese would
obviously refuse this, emphatically and categorically, as a very serious
and open political provocation, also an entirely unreasonable request.
In America, a widely publicised political scandal would force to resign
the US Senator calling for such interventions. Perhaps this is all
ridiculous and not lifelike, but it is noteworthy that the US has not
rejected the initiative of Guaido, to consider "all options on the
table", but did this exactly. The US secretary of state, Pompeo (the
minister of foreign affairs) repeated the term of "interim president"
Gauido, that "all options on the table" are considered. [Pompeo
threatened Maduro, that "his **days are numbered**",]{.underline}
announcing the installation of new US sanctions and other, necessary
steps.29 The classic antic Roman saying can be illustrated: "whatever
Jupiter is free to do, is not allowed for the ox."30 It would be more
fortunate if the strong states would respect the sovereignty of all
other states, and all the states would treat each other as equal,
regardless of which state is stronger or weaker. The capabilities of the
Venezuelan Armed Forces cannot be measured against the great powers that
compete for the country. In a narrow military sense, the Venezuelan
Armed Forces, which are firmly supporting president Maduro, can be
overcome by the US, just like the defeat of president Saddam\'s Iraqi
forces. At the same time, [it is highly questionable whether political
and economic "stabilization" following a possible US military victory
would be "successful", keeping in mind **Iraq or
Afghanistan**]{.underline} etc. Although Russian president
[Putin]{.underline} **[warned]{.underline}** [the US not to
**intervene** with military force in Venezuela]{.underline}, political
willingness to intervene by the Russian military is at least as
questionable as by the US, under the authority of president Trump.
[Whichever of the competing great powers might intervene militarily
**first** in Venezuela, has a **great chance of victory** in a short
term, in a **narrowly military sense**. [This happened in
**Syria**]{.mark}]{.underline}, when the West, wishing to openly
overthrow president Assad, was mostly pleased with the material and
armed support of the opposition. [[Russia]{.mark} militarily [intervened
**quickly** and **openly**]{.mark} in support of **Syrian president
Assad**]{.underline}. With this, [the West was largely **displaced**
from Syria]{.underline}. [It seems a **logical** step for Russia to plan
to **establish a military base in Venezuela**]{.underline}. At the same
time, [with the appearance of Russian **TU-160 strategic bombers**, it
is not difficult to notice that Russia is sending a message]{.underline}
to the US, in fact provoking Washington. Russia "reminded" the US, that
"penetrating and overtaking the "wrong" sphere of interest" could cause
"a legitimate outrage". The emergence of Russian strategic bombers in
Venezuela shows that Russian leadership is well aware of where Venezuela
belongs to, in terms of spheres of interest. To be specific, [Venezuela
currently de facto belongs to Russian/Chinese **sphere of
interest**]{.underline}, despite being in the US sphere of interest
geographically and traditionally. Although [the current Venezuelan laws
**prohibit** the establishment of foreign military bases in the country,
it would be **naïve** to believe that this law **cannot be
amended**]{.underline}.31 [A plan of a possible establishment of a
Russian **air and naval bases** in Venezuela would **clearly show** that
Russia wants to maintain Venezuela in **her sphere of
interest**]{.underline} (together with China) in a long-run. Russia can
later strengthen it with military guarantees. However, Russia (and
China) cannot provide direct military guarantees for Venezuela against
the US, as [[a possible]{.underline}]{.mark} and highly unlikely,
**[[direct Russian-US]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(**[[Chinese-US]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [**[military
conflict]{.underline}** [would]{.underline}]{.mark} [most likely [lead
to the **extinction of humanity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, when
[[including]{.underline}]{.mark} the possibility of **[[massive use of
nucl]{.mark}ear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [If the Venezuelan
demonstrations **deteriorate to a civil war**]{.underline}, its military
"solution" in the classic sense is very risky, if it includes firing at
protesters. At the same time, it is much more likely that, if a civil
war starts, [the US would **attack** the targets of the Venezuelan Armed
Forces supporting]{.underline} president **[Maduro]{.underline}**,
claiming, that the US "wants to prevent the Venezuelan Armed Forces from
being deployed against the Venezuelan people". In the event of a
possible civil war, Russia would be in a militarily sensitive position
because (a) if the protesters are shot by Russian soldiers, it would
have a huge global political price, (b) if Russia would openly support
the Venezuelan Armed Forces being heavily engaged in a civil war on the
side of president Maduro, that could also have serious global political
consequences. According to the official Russian position, the US is
preparing a military invasion of Venezuela in order to remove Maduro
from power. "Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said
that the United States show "sarcasm and arrogance towards the
Venezuelan people" while it imposes humanitarian aid that will be
rejected. Nikolai Patrushev stressed that the United States, deploying
military forces to Puerto Rico and Colombia, is preparing an invasion of
Venezuela to remove legally elected incumbent President Maduro from
power."32 The current extent of the US military build-up in the vicinity
of Venezuela is unclear. It is highly likely, that [the current amount
of US troops around Venezuela is insufficient for a full-scale
invasion]{.underline}. However, [[if **tensions
escalate**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and a **civil war breaks
out**]{.underline}, [the [US troop levels could be **elevated
rapidly**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [US bombardment of Venezuelan troops
loyal to president Maduro might **not even require a military build-up**
in the vicinity of the country]{.underline}, [since the targets are
within reach for the US **anyway**]{.underline}. **[False flag
[operations]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[by the US]{.underline}]{.mark} and
the US-backed opposition [are likely to **[increase tensions]{.mark}**
to create a pretext for the **removal of**]{.underline} president
**[Maduro]{.underline}** from power in Venezuela.33 [If there is

war**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [the **removal of**]{.underline}

Strategy for a Post-Reduction World

Prospects for the Future

[There appears to be little appetite for **any diplomatic engagement
with Russia**]{.underline}, even [outside of arms control. The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Russia have deep-seated
structural and ideological disagreements over]{.underline} Syria and
eastern [**Ukraine**, as well as]{.underline} over [the **role and
appropriate reach of NATO**]{.underline}, which are compounded by
Russia's interference in the U.S. election. [These]{.underline} issues
[play into a broader anti-Russia narrative that **bleeds into arms
control**]{.underline}. The attempted "reset" with Russia at the
beginning of the Obama administration that precipitated the negotiation
of New START is largely viewed as a failure. New START specifically was
seen by arms control skeptics as a measure to lull the United States
into a false sense of security as Russia pressed ahead with its own
nuclear modernization, including the new INF Treaty-violating SSC-8
missile.15 In addition, Russia had not made the same pace of disarmament
for meeting the deadlines put in place by New START for force levels
until recently, which made some pessimistic that Russia will follow
through on its commitments to this treaty as well.16 Thus, [there is a
strong possibility that the Russians are **noncompliant with the INF
Treaty**]{.underline} and that one or both sides will withdraw from the
arrangement, while New START is not extended. The United States needs to
prepare for this possibility and begin putting in the military and
diplomatic footwork necessary to maintain nuclear stability with Russia,
in terms of keeping mutual vulnerability and deterrence between the two
nations, and avoid an arms race reminiscent of the Cold War. To
determine the United States' strategy for the post-reduction world, the
points of mutual agreement must be salvaged from each treaty and wrapped
into a new arrangement between the United States and Russia.

Ultimately, there is not much cause for optimism for salvaging much of
the INF Treaty. Because the treaty completely bans two systems with
similar capabilities, [if one side demonstrates a **willingness to
violate it**, there is not much left to salvage]{.underline}. In
particular, both sides' interest in developing GLCMs would almost
certainly prevent any sort of treaty that would ban that category of
weapon for the time being. [The range limit on ballistic missile systems
could be **reinstated**]{.underline}, though the cruise missile threat
is the real challenge at this juncture given Russia's focus on the
development of this technology for its warfighting purposes in Europe
given U.S. vulnerabilities.17 On-site inspections for the treaty expired
in 2001 and would not likely be favored by the Russians, as they would
demonstrate that the Russians were in noncompliance.18 Even if
inspections were somehow agreed to by the Russians, the Russian
narrative that U.S. missile defense installations violate the treaty
would likely lead to Russians pushing for on-site inspections to be
broadened to U.S. missile defense sites in Europe and the United States,
something that would likely be strongly opposed by U.S. policymakers
given the systems' sensitivity.

New START provides the basis for aspects to be salvaged from previous
arms control treaties. While the reduction aspect may be challenged, by
both the Trump administration and potentially the Russians, the [data
exchanges and on-site inspections may be continued for the sake of
**nuclear stability**]{.underline}. Given national security
professionals' insistence that the United States retains a 'boots on the
ground' presence in Russia to keep an eye on their nuclear capabilities,
there is a strong chance that this could be sold as a mutually
beneficial transparency measure as opposed to an arms control 'gift' to
the Russians, which is how New START has been framed by many of its
detractors.19

Making the Strategy

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [needs a strategy that
confronts the threat posed by the Russian nuclear arsenal]{.underline},
upholds strategic stability, [and **keeps open the possibility of future
negotiations** on arms control treaties]{.underline}. Accordingly, [the
United States should undertake]{.underline} the following measures to
build a workable strategy for a post-arms reduction world:

Immediately begin [**negotiations** on a strategic **nuclear
transparency treaty**]{.underline} with Russia. The United States and
Russia could negotiate an agreement [that would allow both sides to keep
an eye on the other's strategic nuclear forces via arsenal
declarations]{.underline} and associated inspections to verify
declarations. Even if the arms control caps are not followed by either
side, [knowing what the other side has]{.underline} (outside of relying
on one's own national technical means of verification) with inspection
procedures [to back up the declarations would play a part in **avoiding
miscalculations**]{.underline} that may be present in a world without
New START. These transparency measures would likely not include systems
previously banned under the INF Treaty at the onset due to the fact that
it would likely still be a hot button issue, but eventually transparency
could be broadened once the inspections regime is perceived as
legitimate.

Continue with current nuclear modernization plans. The current U.S.
nuclear modernization plan will recapitalize every aspect of the United
States' nuclear arsenal and provide a twenty-first-century deterrent
equipped to respond to a wide range of threats.20 The plan will replace
aging systems in just enough time to prevent any loss of capabilities,
though the time lines will be cutting it incredibly close. The United
States must stick to this plan in order to keep deterrence intact and
avoid any sort of strategic mismatch between the United States and
Russia.

Consider the deployment of additional air- or water-breathing systems.
Violations of the INF Treaty by Russia introduces another capability
that puts U.S. and allied forces at risk throughout Europe without a
clear counter. Deployment of additional conventional capabilities, such
as the Joint Air-to- Surface Standard Missile (JASSM-ER) air-launched
cruise missile, to allied countries would provide weapons with similar
ranges to Russian systems that threaten them and hedge against any
reassurance challenges that the United States may face. In addition, the
development of a follow on to the TLAM-N nuclear-tipped sea-launched
cruise missile would give the United States an INF Treaty-compliant
nuclear capability that would further expand its range of potential
responses to new Russian nuclear capabilities.21

In addition to these positive actions, the United States must also do
its part to avoid any overtures that could be read as antithetical to
nuclear stability. Accordingly, [the United States should
avoid]{.underline} the following:

[Break out of **New START limits**]{.underline}. Russian [budget cuts
mean that they will likely **not be able to grow their nuclear
forces**]{.underline} in the short term, [removing the need for the
United States to attempt to **gain the upper hand**]{.underline} by
growing its own arsenal.22 [If the United States breaks out of limits
first, however, it would **eviscerate U.S. moral authority and
potentially negotiating power** in future negotiations by being painted
as the instigator in the situation and make it hard to pick up where
both sides left off in terms of reductions. This could]{.underline}
potentially [be exploited by Russia to build an anti-U.S.
coalition]{.underline} on nuclear issues and beyond.23

[Building and attempting to deploy a **new GLCM**]{.underline}. While
this would be a tit-for-tat response to Russian INF Treaty violations,
it would not be a helpful decision for nuclear stability for similar
reasons to breaking out of New START limits. First, it would demonstrate
that United States is unwilling to cling to INF Treaty limitations and
thus weaken the U.S. stance on the issue if a follow-on treaty were
attempted at some point in the future. Second, the same capabilities
could be procured in a way that is compliant with the INF Treaty, such
as through air- and water-breathing cruise missiles. Third, U.S. allies
do not want to base U.S. GLCMs, aggravating rather than solving
assurance problems.24

Unilaterally downsize. While it is not the time for growth in the U.S.
arsenal, it is also not the time to reduce nuclear forces in this
scenario. Downsizing while outside of the treaty would put a cap on U.S.
leverage in future negotiations, as the United States would have fewer
forces to negotiate away. In addition, it would send a weak signal that
might be read by allies and the Russians alike that we are willing to
accede to Russian nuclear dominance.

Conclusion

[The combination of staying the **course on modernization**, not
**inciting an arms race**]{.underline}, and [pushing for **increased
transparency measures**]{.underline} between the United States and
Russia [would go a long way toward **maintaining nuclear
stability**]{.underline} between the two countries [and keeping the
future open to the possibility of **additional negotiations on arms
control**. The **existential threat**]{.underline} [posed to the entire
world from nuclear escalation means that the United States
compartmentalize nuclear stability away from **other issues plaguing the
U.S.-Russia relationship**]{.underline}. If the United States is able to
do so, it could lead by example and encourage similar behavior on the
Russia side that could lead to substantive agreement on further
diplomatic efforts. During the Cold War both sides were able to bracket
off nuclear issues as a unique area of potential cooperation. [Cooler
heads **should similarly prevail**]{.underline} in this instance, to
[prevent an arms race reminiscent of the **most dangerous time in the
history of the world**]{.underline}.

Alas, though some arms control advocates would like to argue that the
only purpose of nuclear weapons is to deter a nuclear attack on one's
territory, recent world events confirm that nuclear weapons can have
another plausible purpose for some countries. For smaller or weaker
states, [owning nuclear weapons helps ensure that a large country will
**not be able to attack**]{.underline} them and overthrow their
government. Or, at least, the converse is true --- **[NOT]{.underline}**
[having nukes]{.underline} clearly [leaves one
**vulnerable**]{.underline}.

Just [ask]{.underline} Saddam [**Hussein**, who did not have nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, about the 2003 Iraq war. [Or]{.underline} Moammar
[**Gadhafi**, who also did not]{.underline} have nuclear weapons, about
the 2011 NATO air campaign launched against Libya after he threatened to
exterminate domestic opponents. Of course, [we cannot really ask
them]{.underline} --- because not only are their regimes gone, [they are
**dead**]{.underline}, as a direct consequence of wars that they could
not deter with conventional arms alone.

Watching all this, [Kim]{.underline} Jong Un had [already made the
calculation]{.underline}, long before the Ukraine war, [that he would
cherish the]{.underline} North Korean [nuclear weapons]{.underline} that
his grandfather and father had bequeathed him. Our [efforts to persuade
him to denuclearize have **failed**]{.underline} under U.S. President
Joe Biden's four immediate predecessors, and the Biden team itself
appears to be putting little effort into the quest itself, perhaps out
of recognition that the task is just too hard if attempted in absolutist
terms.

[North Korea is not alone]{.underline}. Twenty four years ago [we tried
to persuade **Pakistan**]{.underline} not to test nuclear weapons after
India had done so. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott led a team
to Islamabad to make the case. Then Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif reluctantly said he had no choice, and, buoyed by Saudi money and
his Chinese ally, Pakistan tested.

Now [we watch a Ukrainian regime vilified as "Nazi"]{.underline} in
nature [by Russian propaganda fighting for]{.underline} its territory,
as well as [its existence]{.underline} as a country --- and indeed the
personal survival of its leadership. Can there be any doubt that Putin
would prefer the dismemberment and annexation of Ukraine --- Putin has
repeatedly called into doubt the very concept of Ukraine as a sovereign
state --- and the capture or killing of its president, Volodymyr
Zelenskyy, given the way Putin has demonized him? When aggressors have
extremist, existential goals like these, nuclear theorists rightly argue
that nuclear weapons alas CAN be relevant, for threatening unacceptable
retaliation to any such attack and thereby deterring it.

At the end of the Cold War, Ukraine had the world's third largest
nuclear arsenal. The fact that, in 1994, Ukraine returned to Russia
almost 2,000 nuclear weapons that it had inherited from the breakup of
the Soviet Union --- receiving in reply a guarantee, in the form of the
Budapest Memorandum (also signed by the U.K. and U.S.) that Ukraine
would not be attacked --- adds insult to the injury. Presumably Kyiv
would like to take that decision back, given Russia's subsequent
behavior.

Some [countries will draw]{.underline} two [lessons]{.underline},
neither in the interest of the United States, from this history. [If you
have nuclear weapons, **keep them**. If you don't have them]{.underline}
yet, **[get them]{.underline}**, especially if you lack a strong
defender like the United States as your ally, and [if you have
**beef**]{.underline} with a big country that could plausibly lead to
war.

Thinking through similar hypothetical scenarios 60 years ago, President
John F. Kennedy predicted that there would be at least 25 nuclear
weapons powers in the course of the 20th century. Luckily, he was wrong,
and today we still have only nine. But the reasons for Kennedy's fears
persist; in fact, recent events have exacerbated and magnified them.

There is no simple solution to this problem, and we certainly do not
propose that the United States enter the Ukraine war and fight a nuclear
superpower today to reduce the risks of nuclear nonproliferation
tomorrow. That would be oxymoronic in the extreme.

However, there are other more practical implications of this analysis.
One is clearly that the Biden team and U.S. government, more broadly,
should be working as hard as possible, not only to help Ukraine defend
itself, but to seek a diplomatic solution to the conflict that preserves
intact most or all of Ukraine's territory as well as its government.
Otherwise, beyond the further damage done to Ukraine and its people, the
resulting precedent will be terrible for the cause of nuclear
nonproliferation. Second, we need to be more careful about promising
alliance expansion when we don't really mean it. NATO proposed, back in
2008, that Ukraine would someday be invited to join the alliance --- but
with no timetable and no interim security guarantee. That had the net
effect of painting a bullseye on Kyiv's back that Russia has now
targeted. Third, where we do have allies and alliances, we need to be
resolute and consistent in conveying our seriousness about defending
them. Biden is doing this latter job well, but his predecessor did not.

If we fail in these efforts, [Kennedy's prediction about the spread of
nuclear weapons may wind up just being **premature**, not
**wrong**]{.underline}. That would be a very dangerous and regrettable
outcome for the future of international security.

However, [nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration is [**unlikely to accelerate**
or prove]{.mark} to be **[a]{.mark} major
[danger]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Terrorists are likely to continue to
find that obtaining and using nuclear weapons is exceedingly difficult.
And aggressive counterproliferation policies can generate costs far
higher than those likely to be inflicted by the proliferation problem
they seek to address. Those policies need careful reconsideration.

Nuclear Proliferation

Except for their effects on agonies, obsessions, rhetoric, posturing,
and spending, [the consequences of nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration [have
been]{.mark}]{.underline} largely [**[benign]{.mark}**: those who have
acquired the weapons have ["**used**"]{.mark} them **simply [to
stoke]{.mark} their [egos]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} to **[deter]{.mark} real
or imagined threats**]{.underline}. For the most part, **[nuclear
[powers]{.mark}]{.underline}** have [found the weapons to be **a notable
waste of time**, **money**, **effort**, and **scientific talent**.
They]{.underline} have [**quietly [kept]{.mark}** the [weapons **in
storage**]{.mark} and haven't **even found much benefit** in rattling
them from **time to time**]{.underline}. If the recent efforts to keep
Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons have been successful, those efforts
have done Iran a favor.

There has never been a militarily compelling reason to use nuclear
weapons, particularly because it has not been possible to identify
suitable targets---or targets that couldn't be attacked as effectively
by conventional munitions. Conceivably, conditions exist under which
nuclear weapons could serve a deterrent function, but there is little
reason to suspect that they have been necessary to deter war thus far,
even during the Cold War. The main Cold War contestants have never
believed that a repetition of World War II, whether embellished by
nuclear weapons or not, is remotely in their interests.

Moreover, the weapons have not proved to be crucial status symbols. How
much more status would Japan have if it possessed nuclear weapons? Would
anybody pay a great deal more attention to Britain or France if their
arsenals held 5,000 nuclear weapons, or much less if they had none? Did
China need nuclear weapons to impress the world with its economic growth
or its Olympics?

Those [considerations help explain **why alarmists** have been **wrong
for decades** about **the pace** of **nuclear
proliferation**]{.underline}. Most famously, in the 1960s, President
John Kennedy anticipated that in another decade "fifteen or twenty or
twenty-five nations may have these weapons." Yet, of the **[[dozens
of]{.mark} technologically [capable countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**
that have [[considered]{.mark} obtaining **nuclear [arsenals]{.mark}**[,
**very few** have]{.mark} done so]{.underline}. Insofar as most leaders
of most countries (even rogue ones) have considered acquiring the
weapons, they have come to appreciate several drawbacks of doing so:
nuclear weapons are dangerous, costly, and likely to rile the neighbors.
Moreover, as the University of Southern California's Jacques Hymans has
demonstrated, the weapons have also been exceedingly difficult for
administratively dysfunctional countries to obtain---it took decades for
North Korea and Pakistan to do so. In consequence, [**alarmist
predictions** about **proliferation chains**, **cascades**,
**[dominoes]{.mark}**, **waves**, **avalanches**, **epidemics**, and
**points of no return**]{.underline} have [[proved
**faulty**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Although [proliferation has so far had **little
consequence**]{.underline}, that is not because the only countries to
get nuclear weapons have had rational leaders. [**Large, important
[countries]{.mark}** [that acquired the bomb were
run]{.mark}]{.underline} at the time [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
unchallenged---perhaps certifiably
**[[deranged]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[**monsters**. Consider]{.mark}
Joseph [Stalin]{.mark}]{.underline}, who, in 1949, was planning to
change the climate of the Soviet Union by planting a lot of trees,
[[and]{.mark} Mao [Zedong]{.mark}]{.underline}, who, in 1964, had just
carried out a bizarre social experiment that resulted in an artificial
famine in which tens of millions of Chinese perished.

Some also fear that a country might use its nuclear weapons to
"dominate" its area. That argument was used with dramatic urgency before
2003 when Saddam Hussein supposedly posed great danger, and it has been
frequently applied to Iran. Exactly how that domination is to be carried
out is never made clear. The notion, apparently, is this: should an
atomic rogue state rattle the occasional rocket, other countries in the
area, suitably intimidated, would bow to its demands. Far more likely,
threatened states would make common cause with each other and with other
concerned countries (including nuclear ones) against the threatening
neighbor. That is how countries coalesced into an alliance of
convenience to oppose Iraq's region-threatening invasion of Kuwait in
1990.

Yet [**another concern** has been]{.underline} that the [weapons will
**go off**, by [**accident** or **miscalculation**]{.mark}]{.underline},
devastating the planet in the process: the weapons exist in the
thousands, sooner or later one or more of them will inevitably go off.
But [those [prognostications]{.mark} **have now [failed to
deliver]{.mark}** [for 70 years]{.mark}. **That [time period]{.mark}**
[suggests]{.mark} **something [more than luck]{.mark}** is
**operating**]{.underline}. Moreover, [the [notion]{.mark} that [if
**one nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon** [goes off]{.mark} in one place, the
[world will]{.mark}]{.underline} necessarily [[be plunged into]{.mark}
**thermonuclear [cataclysm]{.mark}** [should remain]{.mark} in **the
[domain]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **Hollywood
[scriptwriters]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Stephen M. **Walt 21**, 3-23-21, \"It's Time to Fold America's Nuclear
Umbrella,\"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/03/23/its-time-to-fold-americas-nuclear-umbrella/,
jy

"Europe needs to build up the nuclear dimension of its defense efforts,
including by retaining and modernizing capabilities for existing NATO
nuclear missions and by France and Britain working together to extend
their nuclear deterrents to their European allies."

Why is this statement so intriguing? Because it shows the authors of
this report recognize that [Europe]{.underline} as a whole [might be
**more secure** if it could rely on a **locally based
deterrent**]{.underline} instead of continuing to shelter under the U.S.
nuclear umbrella. And [if that is true for the nations of
**Europe**]{.underline}, then [it might well be true for
**others**]{.underline}. Although the report's authors are opposed to
new states joining the nuclear club (Britain and France are already
members), their statement clearly implies that [deterrence would be
**strengthened** if states facing **serious external threats** had a
**nuclear guarantee**]{.underline} [that didn't depend on Uncle
Sam]{.underline}.

This is hardly a new issue. Since fairly early in the nuclear age, the
United States has used nuclear weapons to "extend deterrence" and shield
some of its allies. It sought to convince potential adversaries that the
United States might use its formidable nuclear arsenal if these allies
were attacked, even if the United States was not. Of course, there was
always some chance that [a war involving one of the United States'
allies might **escalate**]{.underline} to the nuclear level, either by
accident, [through **inadvertence**, or via **deliberate
decision**]{.underline}, no matter what U.S. leaders said in advance.
Even so, Washington went to considerable lengths to make its nuclear
umbrella credible, partly to discourage enemies from attacking but also
to convince its allies not to get nuclear weapons themselves.

Accordingly, U.S. leaders made lots of public statements linking the
U.S. arsenal to its core alliance commitments, and NATO drew up various
plans and doctrinal pronouncements designed to reinforce perceptions of
a reliable U.S. guarantee. The United States also deployed thousands of
warheads on some of its allies' territory, along with dual-key
arrangements that gave those allies some say in how, when, or if these
fearsome weapons got used. Lastly, and very importantly, the United
States kept trying to achieve a meaningful degree of nuclear superiority
to make a possible first use of nuclear weapons to defend allies more
credible. Instead of acquiring a "minimum deterrent" (i.e., retaliatory
forces that could survive any possible attack and then inflict
unacceptable damage on an aggressor), U.S. war plans and weapons
decisions always focused on trying to come out on top in the awful event
of an actual nuclear war.

Why did the United States do this? In good part because [convincing
people you might use nuclear weapons to defend an ally **isn't
easy**]{.underline}. One might imagine a U.S. president using nuclear
weapons to retaliate against a direct attack on U.S. territory or to
deter the extremely unlikely prospect of a conventional invasion that
threatened U.S. independence. This is the one thing nuclear weapons are
good for: deterring existential threats to their possessors'
independence or autonomy. This form of deterrence (sometimes termed
"basic" or "Type I") works because the deterring side will almost
certainly care more about preserving its own independence than a
potential attacker is likely to care about trying to take it away.
Because the balance of resolve favors the defender, even much weaker
nuclear powers can deter enemies from attacking them directly. If you
don't find this argument persuasive, remember the U.S. attacked
non-nuclear Iraq in 2003 and non-nuclear Libya in 2011, but it leaves
nuclear-armed North Korea alone.

By contrast, deterring a conventional or a nuclear attack on an ally by
threatening to go nuclear---and convincing your allies that you really
mean it---is more challenging. [It is one thing to **threaten to use
nuclear weapons** to keep one's own country from being subjugated but
quite another to do so to **save an ally**]{.underline} from defeat or
domination. Or, as people used to wonder back in the Cold War, [would a
U.S. president really risk Washington or Chicago to save Paris or
Berlin?]{.underline} Long after they had left office, a few former U.S.
officials suggested the answer was almost certainly "[**no**." Extended
deterrence]{.underline} could still work because potential attackers
can't be sure about any of this, but it still [**isn't as credible** as
deterring attacks on one's own territory.]{.underline}

The solution to this conundrum---if one can call it that---is to achieve
overwhelming "nuclear superiority." If you could wipe out an adversary's
entire nuclear force in a first strike, you wouldn't have to fear its
retaliation, and using nuclear weapons to defend an ally would be much
more credible. Even if a splendid first strike were not possible,
perhaps you could convince a potential attacker that it will end up even
worse off than you are at the end of a nuclear war to convince it not to
put so much as a toe on the first rung of the escalation ladder.

Thus, the perceived need to extend deterrence is one of the reasons why
the United States has long sought nuclear superiority. It's not the only
reason: A genuine first strike capability could limit damage in the
event of an actual war. A few commentators have also tried to
argue---not very convincingly---that superiority would enable the
stronger side to coerce weaker states in crises. Chasing the holy grail
of a first-strike advantage was also popular with defense contractors
and parts of the armed services because it requires spending billions of
dollars annually on more and more accurate weapons, more efficient and
destructive warheads, improved surveillance and anti-submarine warfare
capabilities, and lots of other shiny objects.

Interestingly, a number of sophisticated [scholars]{.underline} have
recently [claimed]{.underline} that [technological advances have put the
United States on the brink of a true first-strike
capability.]{.underline} Perhaps [in **theory**, but certainly not as a
**usable option**]{.underline}. To see why, ask yourself what you would
do [if you were president and facing a serious crisis]{.underline} with
a nuclear-armed adversary. [You've put the armed services on
alert]{.underline}, and there is some danger that force might be used
and fighting could escalate. [Suppose your]{.underline} military
[advisors and intelligence experts tell you if you order a first strike
now, you can almost certainly destroy the enemy's entire nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}, leaving the United States unscathed and in an
ideal position to resolve the dispute on favorable terms.

Being a sensible person, you'd undoubtedly ask them: "[Can you
**guarantee that**?]{.underline} Are you absolutely, 100 percent sure
the enemy will have zero usable weapons left, and therefore, we won't
even get our hair mussed?"

"We are highly confident of success," you are told. "But there is a slim
chance that a few enemy weapons would survive and reach U.S. soil. No
more than one to three."

[Even if you weren't troubled by the **moral issues**]{.underline}
involved in ordering an attack [that would kill **untold numbers of
people**]{.underline} (and you ought to be), would you do it? Of course
[you **wouldn't**]{.underline}, because [you wouldn't want to risk
losing New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, or any other major U.S.
city, which is what might happen if that first strike you authorized
turned out to be just a **tiny bit less effective than your advisors
predicted**]{.underline}. To issue a launch order, [you'd have to
believe the proposed attack would work perfectly the **very first time
it was executed**]{.underline} ([**simulations** and **exercises**
aren't the same]{.underline}), almost [all of the missiles and bombs
that have been sitting in silos or storage facilities for years **would
work as designed**]{.underline}, and [the other side wouldn't have
**dispersed its own forces**]{.underline} or hidden some extra weapons
in places you had failed to detect. Based on everything the United
States' knows about complex military operations and the limits of
intelligence, [you'd be a **fool to roll the dice in this
way**]{.underline}.

One more thing: [As first-strike capabilities improve, adversaries may
respond by keeping forces on **higher alert**]{.underline} [or adopting
**"launch-on-warning" procedures** that increase the risk of
**accidental** or **inadvertent war**]{.underline}. No matter what U.S.
forces are capable of in theory, in short, [it's hard to see how any
president **would be willing to use nukes first**]{.underline} even if
the probability of "success" was extremely high. [This reality casts
further doubt on the whole idea of extended deterrence]{.underline},
insofar as [it is based on the threat to **deliberately escalate to the
nuclear level**]{.underline} if a key ally is in danger of being
conquered.

Extending a protective umbrella over allies in Europe and Asia may have
made good sense during the Cold War, both to protect them and to
discourage proliferation. But [the]{.underline} nuclear [weapons
environment has **changed**: The number of nuclear-armed states has
crept **upward**]{.underline}, and [several countries]{.underline}
(India, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom) [are increasing the size of
their **own arsenals**]{.underline} (though they remain far lower than
U.S. or Russian levels). Moreover, [the United States is not as tightly
coupled to some of its traditional allies as it was during the Cold War,
and serious rifts may **continue to grow**]{.underline} despite the
Biden administration's efforts to restore alliance solidarity and
reassert U.S. leadership.

Which raises the obvious question: Does it still make sense to shield
allies under the U.S. nuclear umbrella? [Using the threat of nuclear use
to protect other countries is **not cost- or risk-free**]{.underline},
and [it may **even be more dangerous** than letting some other states
**acquire arsenals of their own**]{.underline} and [encouraging them to
rely on "Type I" deterrence]{.underline} provided by their own national
capabilities.

This view has been advanced before---most notably by Kenneth Waltz in a
controversial Adelphi Paper 40 years ago. Waltz was not advocating
giving other states the bomb or arguing that the rapid spread of nuclear
weapons would be desirable; his central point was that trying to prevent
the slow spread of these weapons was not without costs of its own and
that in some cases, as he put it, "[**more** may be
**better**]{.underline}." The question is: Is that becoming the case
today?

To be sure, folding the nuclear umbrella might well have some negative
effects. It might make states long accustomed to U.S. protection
question its commitment (though there's no logical reason for them to do
so if it is still in the United States' interest to aid their defense in
other ways). It could also reduce U.S. influence or leverage if certain
allies were no longer as dependent on U.S. protection, though folding
the umbrella would not eliminate their reliance on other elements of
U.S. power. Removing the U.S. nuclear guarantee might encourage a few
states to pursue nuclear arms of their own, but [it is not obvious that
acquisition by **Japan** or **Germany** would be a terrible outcome from
a purely U.S. perspective]{.underline}.

Moreover, [even the possibility that these states might take over
responsibility for deterring attacks on their own territory could have a
**sobering effect**]{.underline} [on a **rising China** and a
**recalcitrant Russia**]{.underline}. In particular, it would remind
Beijing and Moscow that [their own behavior will affect the **strategic
calculations**]{.underline} that their neighbors make in the near
future, [including decisions about **nuclear arms**. If China doesn't
want to face **more nuclear weapons states**]{.underline} in its
immediate region, for instance, then [its leaders should **start asking
themselves what they can do**]{.underline} to make those neighbors feel
less need for additional protection. The obvious answer: [**Stop
harassing them** in various ways, drop the sharp-elbowed approach to
diplomacy, stick to agreements previously reached, and do more to
resolve existing disputes on a fair-minded basis.]{.underline}

Whatever Washington ultimately chooses to do with its nuclear umbrella,
the more important task is to move beyond the tendency to see nuclear
weapons as potent signs of status, indispensable tools of statecraft, or
powerful sources of leverage. Nuclear weapons are extremely useful for
deterring direct and all-out attacks on one's own homeland but not much
else. For that purpose, [a great power doesn't need an **enormous
arsenal**]{.underline} or some hypothetical capability to "fight and
win" a nuclear exchange. [All it needs is a stockpile that can **survive
an enemy attack**]{.underline} and be able to respond in kind. Properly
concealed or protected, they don't need to be poised and ready to strike
at a moment's notice. [Fetishizing the bomb]{.underline} and [using it
to try to protect others isn't just expensive; it may also be
**dangerous**.]{.underline}

Failure at Deterrence,\"

The Putin Paradox

When it became clear, in late 2021, that Putin was mobilizing for a
potential invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration faced a dilemma.
America has a compelling interest in preventing revisionist powers from
destabilizing the global system through large-scale aggression --- and
in preventing Russia from overrunning Ukraine and threatening NATO's
entire eastern periphery.

Yet Ukraine is not a U.S. treaty ally. It is located on the wrong side
of the world for a superpower hoping to focus on China. It was being
threatened by a dictator with a penchant for risk-taking and thousands
of nuclear weapons. And America's military posture in Europe was so
minimal that the Pentagon might have anticipated great difficulty
defending Ukraine even had Biden wanted to. The result was a deep, and
obvious, ambivalence in U.S. policy.

U.S. [officials]{.underline} repeatedly [stated]{.underline} that [they
**sought to deter Putin**]{.underline} from invading. [Yet Biden
simultaneously took the use of force **off the table**]{.underline}
early in the crisis. [This left the administration relying on a form of
deterrence that was]{.underline} very **[creative]{.underline}** but
[not]{.underline} very **[integrated]{.underline}**.

The administration began with "deterrence by disclosure" --- the release
of detailed intelligence to reveal Putin's plans, frustrate his
deceptions and rally an international coalition. This enabled Washington
and its allies to threaten Russia with sharp, [multilateral **economic
sanctions**]{.underline}.

The administration also [promised]{.underline} that [Moscow would
suffer]{.underline} adverse strategic consequences, such as additional
U.S. and NATO force deployments in Eastern Europe. Finally, the West
rapidly bolstered Ukrainian military capabilities, raising the price
Russia would pay if Putin pounced.

This was classic deterrence by punishment. The U.S. was not threatening
to prevent Russia from conquering Ukraine --- the military element of
integrated deterrence was absent. Bide[n was threatening Putin with a
bundle of penalties]{.underline} that would leave Russia weaker even if
it accomplished its military objectives.

When Putin attacked, in late February, the democratic world showed, as
one U.S. official put it, that the U.S. and its allies could indeed use
their economic power to "absolutely pummel aggressors." Official and
private-sector sanctions are causing shortages of basic goods and a
degree of financial and technological isolation Moscow clearly did not
expect. The U.S. has pursued a "new kind of economic statecraft with the
power to inflict damage that rivals military might," Biden has said.
Meanwhile, Ukrainian resistance, bolstered by Western weapons, has put
Moscow in a military vise.

Yet [it is hard to take seriously the Pentagon's boast that "integrated
deterrence comes out **smelling pretty good**,"]{.underline} because
[Putin]{.underline} --- [in invading Ukraine]{.underline} --- [did
exactly what **America tried to prevent**]{.underline} him from doing.
And [had Putin]{.underline} been less greedy, [ordered only a **limited
operation**]{.underline} in Donbas or elsewhere, [he might have
succeeded in grabbing Ukrainian territory without suffering **global
blowback**]{.underline}. So why did integrated deterrence fail?

Biden Said Too Much

One answer involves an inherent problem with
[deterrence-by-punishment]{.underline} --- it [can be **hard to
signal**]{.underline}, before an act of aggression, how bad the eventual
punishment will be. [Had the West credibly and explicitly threatened to
do what it actually did]{.underline} --- killing the Nord Stream II
pipeline, sanctioning Russia's central bank, booting Russian financial
institutions from the SWIFT global payments system, and so on ---
[perhaps Putin might have reconsidered.]{.underline} As Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov admitted, "No one" in Moscow anticipated "what sanctions
the West might apply."

The problem, though, was that [**not even Western officials** knew how
**far they would go**]{.underline} [until Putin tried to erase Ukraine
from the map.]{.underline} By the time that reaction came, [deterrence
had]{.underline} already **[failed]{.underline}**.

A second answer is that [Washington botched the application of
**deterrent threats**]{.underline}. To be clear, Biden mostly deserves
high marks in managing this crisis. The administration is waging an
extremely successful proxy war against Russian forces. But Biden's
declaratory policy --- the effort to shape Putin's incentives through
precisely worded statements --- has been a disaster.

While it is undoubtedly important to avoid a great-power military
showdown over Ukraine, [removing any]{.underline} threat of [American
intervention simply ensured that Putin **didn't have to
worry**]{.underline} about matters getting out of hand. Similarly,
Biden's offhand remark that the allies would simply bicker among
themselves in the event of a "limited incursion" was probably accurate
--- and it probably gave Putin hope that he could split the opposing
coalition.

The third answer is the most sobering. Perhaps Putin simply valued the
subordination of Ukraine, and the restoration of a Russian empire, so
highly that anything short of the threat of a major war with the West
would have failed to move him. If so, then [the **one
thing**]{.underline} [that might have deterred Putin was the one thing
that U.S. and Western officials were **unwilling**]{.underline} ---
whether wisely or unwisely --- [to contemplate]{.underline}.

Calculated Risks

That's a problem, because [Ukraine isn't the **last**]{.underline}
great-power military crisis the U.S. will face. The threat of economic
and financial sanctions alone probably won't prevent Xi Jinping from
attacking Taiwan, in part because it would be far harder for the
democratic world to do to China --- with its larger, more globally
integrated economy --- what it has done to Russia. [Even if Putin
doesn't attack a NATO country, he]{.underline} or a successor [could
**provoke another showdown in Eastern Europe**]{.underline} involving
Finland, Sweden or Belarus.

Moreover, [deterrence **doesn't stop**]{.underline} when the war begins,
and [America still faces hard questions about how to deter Russia in
Ukraine.]{.underline} As Moscow struggles to achieve its objectives, it
could take several actions --- employing chemical weapons, striking
neighboring states that support Ukraine, or further escalating its
brutal siege tactics --- that would dramatically increase the damage or
even lead to a wider war.

So far, however, [Biden has been **wobbly** in applying the **calculated
risk-taking**]{.underline} that deterrence requires.

When Putin first raised the alert status of his nuclear forces, Biden
canceled a scheduled U.S. missile test --- a demonstration of
responsibility, but also of a proclivity for restraint when confronted
with even the vaguest risk of escalation. Then, on March 11, [Biden
promised to defend]{.underline} "every inch of **[NATO]{.underline}**,"
[while also pledging to stay out of]{.underline} Ukraine at all costs,
given that intervention would cause "**[World War III]{.underline}**."

Of course, [saying that]{.underline} virtually nothing could prompt
direct U.S. intervention in Ukraine may [make Putin feel]{.underline}
that [he has **license to escalate**]{.underline}. And [if]{.underline}
any [war]{.underline} with Russia [would]{.underline} indeed [be "World
War III,"]{.underline} then [would Washington **really defend even its
NATO allies in a crisis**?]{.underline}

Biden has subsequently tried to clean up some of these statements, and
his administration may be signaling privately that there are forms of
escalation it will not tolerate. Yet [when it comes to a problem we
haven't faced in decades]{.underline} --- deterring major aggression by
a nuclear-armed adversary --- [America is **still shaking off the
rust.**]{.underline}

#### The [sole question]{.underline} for this debate is [where]{.underline} to spend [finite resources]{.underline}. Russia is [defensive]{.underline} and [limited in power]{.underline}, whereas China is seeking [international power]{.underline}. An axis is the [worst scenario]{.underline}.

This may explain why US President Joe [Biden is treating a "**rogue**"
Russia as a peer competitor]{.underline}, when [he **should be focused**
on the challenge from America's **actual peer**, China]{.underline}. In
comparison to Russia, [China's population is]{.underline} about **[ten
times bigger]{.underline}**, [its economy is almost **ten times
larger**]{.underline}, and [its military expenditure is around **four
times greater**]{.underline}. Not only is [China]{.underline} more
powerful; it genui[nely seeks to **supplant the US as the preeminent
global power**]{.underline}. By contrast, [with its military buildup on
Ukraine's borders, Russia is seeking to mitigate a **perceived security
threat**]{.underline} in its neighborhood.

Hastening the decline of US global leadership is hardly the preserve of
Democrats. [A **bipartisan parade**]{.underline} of US leaders [has
failed to recognize that the post-Cold War unipolar world
order]{.underline}, characterized by unchallenged US economic and
military predominance, [is **long gone**]{.underline}. The US squandered
its "unipolar moment," especially by waging an expensive and amorphous
"Global War on Terrorism," including several military interventions, and
through its treatment of Russia.

After its Cold War victory, [the US]{.underline} essentially took an
extended victory lap, pursuing strategic maneuvers that flaunted its
dominance. Notably, it [sought to **expand NATO**]{.underline} to
Russia's backyard, [but made **little effort** to bring Russia into the
Western fold]{.underline}, as it had done with Germany and Japan after
World War II. [The **souring of relations**]{.underline} with the
Kremlin [contributed to **Russia's eventual
remilitarization**.]{.underline}

So, [while the US remains the world's **foremost military power**, it
has been **stretched thin** by the decisions and commitments it has
made, **in Europe**]{.underline} and elsewhere, since 1991. This goes a
long way toward explaining why the US has ruled out deploying its own
troops to defend Ukraine today. What the US is offering Ukraine --
weapons and ammunition -- cannot protect the country from Russia, which
has an overwhelming military advantage.

But US leaders made another fatal mistake since the Cold War: by aiding
China's rise, they helped to create the greatest rival their country has
ever faced. Unfortunately, they have yet to learn from this. Instead,
[the US continues to dedicate **insufficient attention and resources**
to an excessively wide array of global issues, from Russian revanchism
and **Chinese aggression**]{.underline} to lesser threats in the Middle
East and Africa and on the Korean Peninsula. And it continues
inadvertently to bolster China's global influence, not least through its
overuse of sanctions.

For example, by barring friends and allies from importing Iranian oil,
two successive US administrations enabled China not only to secure oil
at a hefty discount, but also to become a top investor in -- and
security partner of -- the Islamic Republic. US sanctions have similarly
pushed resource-rich Myanmar into China's arms. As Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen, whose country has faced a US arms embargo over its
ties to China, asked last year, "If I don't rely on China, who will I
rely on?"

Russia has been asking itself the same question. [Though Russia and
China kept each other at **arm's length** for decades, US-led
sanctions]{.underline} introduced after Russia's 2014 annexation of
Crimea [drove]{.underline} President Vladimir [Putin to pursue a
**closer strategic partnership with China**. The bilateral relationship
is **likely to deepen**]{.underline}, regardless of what happens in
Ukraine. But the raft of harsh new sanctions the US has promised to
implement in the event of a Russian invasion will accelerate this shift
significantly, with China as the big winner.

The heavy financial penalties the US has planned -- including the
"nuclear option" of disconnecting Russian banks from the international
SWIFT payments system -- would turn China into Russia's banker, enabling
it to reap vast profits and expand the international use of its
currency, the renminbi. If Biden fulfilled his pledge to block the Nord
Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is set to deliver Russian supplies directly
to Germany via the Baltic Sea, China would gain greater access to
Russian energy.

In fact, by securing a commitment from Putin this month to a nearly
tenfold increase in Russian natural gas exports, China is building a
safety net that could -- in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan --
withstand Western energy sanctions and even a blockade. China could also
benefit militarily by demanding greater access to Russian military
technology in exchange for its support.

For the US, [a strengthened Russia-China axis is the **worst possible
outcome**]{.underline} of the Ukraine crisis. [The best outcome would be
a **compromise with Russia**]{.underline} to ensure that it does not
invade and possibly annex Ukraine. By [enabling the US to **avoid
further entanglement in Europe**, this would permit a more **realistic
balancing of key objectives**]{.underline} -- especially [checking
**Chinese aggression**]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific -- with
available resources and capabilities.

[The future of the US-led international]{.underline} order [will be
**decided in Asia**]{.underline}, and [China is currently doing
everything in its power to ensure that order's demise]{.underline}.
Already, China is powerful enough that it can host the Winter Olympics
even as it carries out a genocide against Muslims in the Xinjiang
region, with limited pushback. [If the Biden administration does not
recognize the **true scale of the threat**]{.underline} China poses,
[and adopt an **appropriately targeted strategy soon**, whatever window
of opportunity for preserving US preeminence remains may well
**close**]{.underline}.

#### [Defensive realism]{.underline} explains Russian behavior. They're [realist]{.underline} and [status seeking]{.underline}. Failure to reciprocate causes [nuclear war]{.underline}.

[No conflict "**just happens**," it is an historical
process]{.underline} and therefore [we must look at that
process]{.underline}. I propose that we start with the collapse of the
Soviet Union; a time when the "peace dividend" was widely proclaimed. It
has now been comprehensively documented [that a **number of US state
officials** made explicit promises that with the unification of
Germany]{.underline} the Western [NATO]{.underline} alliance [would
**not move any further east**]{.underline}. Instead, a neutral Eastern
Europe was envisaged, especially by the Russians, as a way of ensuring
an enduring peace. With the collapse of Russia into a depression worse
than that suffered by the US in the 1930s, and the weakness of the
Russian leadership of Boris Yelstin, such considerations were thrown
aside.

In 1999 [the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland]{.underline} joined the
ranks of NATO members. In 2004, [Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, and the
Baltic states]{.underline} of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia [were
added;]{.underline} with Latvia and Estonia sharing borders with the
main part of Russia---the latter not far away from the major Russian
city of St. Petersburg. Several years later, at the 2007 Munich Security
Conference, Russian President Vladimir [Putin explicitly **stated his
discomfort**]{.underline} and alarm at the eastward march of NATO. His
concerns were rejected out of hand by the West. [Then came the **2008
war with Georgia**]{.underline}, which was partly [triggered by tensions
arising from]{.underline} Georgian President Mikheil [Saakashvili
seeking **NATO membership**]{.underline}. At this time, Belarus was
ruled by Alexander Lukashenko, a dictator who attempted to balance
between East and West, while Ukraine was governed by the Western-leaning
Viktor Yushchenko (after the 2004 Orange Revolution that led to the
overturning of the election of the Russian-leaning Viktor Yanukovych)
who stated a desire to join the EU and NATO. Russia's concerns about
having a large Western-aligned state only 500 kilometres from Moscow
were partly assuaged with the election of Yanukovych in 2010.

Then came the fateful events of 2014, as Yanukovych struggled to balance
between the EU and Russia, leading to his rejection of an EU association
agreement that would have significantly damaged trade relations with
Russia and aligned Ukrainian foreign policy more with that of the West.
At this time, a compromise agreement between the EU and Russia would
have maintained the balance in Ukraine and helped allay Russia's
security concerns, but that was not forthcoming.

At this point we should stop and [think about what the response of the
US would have been to, for example, a Cold War alliance between
**Canada** and the **Soviet Union**]{.underline}. Indeed, [any
reasonable person would assume either a **US-inspired
coup**]{.underline} [or an outright **invasion**. **Belarus** and
**Ukraine** are to Russia what **Canada** and **Mexico** are to the
US]{.underline}. Instead of a compromise agreement, the elected
president of [Ukraine]{.underline} was deposed in a coup---openly
supported by Western politicians and diplomats who spent significant
time in Maidan Square egging the protesters on---that [installed an
**extremely anti-Russian administration**. Imagine Russian
politicians]{.underline} and diplomats publicly [endorsing protestors
against the current Canadian government who amassed outside parliament
last month]{.underline}. Of course, the US would be extremely concerned,
just as Russia was in 2014.

In response to the Maidan coup, [Russia acted to **maintain its national
interests**, including its]{.underline} [**massive naval base** in
**Crimea**]{.underline}. The debate over whether this was a breakaway
region freely voting to join Russia or an annexation of Ukrainian
territory by Russia is an endless one, but it is pointless from a
realist point of view. [Russia secured its security by maintaining its
naval base]{.underline} in the Black Sea and making sure that such a
base did not fall into the hands of the West. Russia also supplied arms
and support to the two breakaway republics in the southwestern Donbas
region, full of Russian speaking Ukrainians who did not wish to be ruled
by a Ukrainian nationalist government.

Since 2014 [Ukraine has become **increasingly aligned with the West**,
signing the EU association agreement and accepting extensive military
training]{.underline}, coordination and munitions [from]{.underline}
Western nations, including Canada. Its leaders have increasingly called
for membership of both [the **EU and NATO**, with those calls escalating
recently with **little pushback from the West**]{.underline}. Last year,
[Putin stated Russia's security redlines, which **included a Ukraine in
NATO**]{.underline} but again these were treated with disdain. Even his
promises of a "military-technical" response by Russia were not heeded,
and the Ukrainian president's calls for Ukraine to become a nuclear
power were not rejected by Western leaders.

Ultimately, [Russia acted out of its **rational self-interest** after
all of its calls for a non-military resolution to its legitimate, and
actually existential, security concerns had been rejected. Russia
invaded Ukraine and will turn it into a Russia-aligned nation, securing
its own security]{.underline}; any commentators who think that Russia is
not militarily capable of doing such a thing are ignorant of the basic
facts on the ground and the Russian military.

All war is of course a horrible thing, as is the ongoing genocidal war
in Yemen by a Saudi Arabia that Canada arms, as was the illegal war of
aggression against Iraq by our ally the US, and as was the destruction
of the state of Libya by NATO. Those who cry out against the civilian
deaths in Ukraine must take time to consider why those other deaths
aren't as important, just as with the over 13,000 civilian deaths in the
Donbas in the last eight years caused chiefly by Ukrainian government
forces and pro-Kyiv militias. The answer is of course that they are not
different, just some of the killing is done by those our state considers
to be allies and some by those it considers to be enemies.

[A realist analysis puts such considerations to one side and allows us
to **rationally assess what actions are appropriate**]{.underline}; just
as [**cooler heads prevailed** during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962
and saved the world from **nuclear annihilation**. To get lost in o**ur
own propaganda**]{.underline} [is incredibly dangerous when our opponent
is a **nuclear power capable** of **ending human
civilization**]{.underline}.

Th[is should be a time for reflection on the Western policy
establishment's responsibility for creating an existential threat to
Russia that should have been expected to lead to a **major
response**]{.underline}. The [sanctions]{.underline} currently being
leveled against the Russian economy [are **unlikely to dissuade**
Putin]{.underline}, and [Russia has **extensively prepared for them**;
it is a massive exporter of raw materials that the world **cannot do
without**]{.underline}, and the 'international community' outside the
West has refused to sanction Russia.

The extensive damage to Western economies, especially Europe, through
the range of sanctions enacted, are currently being exacerbated through
the theft of Russia's foreign exchange reserves. The West benefits
hugely from the current global financial system based upon the US
dollar, but it has now been displayed that the West thinks nothing of
outright theft and financial warfare. The previous cases of Iran,
Venezuela, and Afghanistan were relatively small. The case of Russia is
large enough to catch other nation's attention and lead them to create a
parallel financial system.

What's more, [Western statements of support]{.underline}, no matter how
fulsome, [come to **nothing**]{.underline} when a real war starts with a
country that possesses a highly competent military and nuclear weapons.
[Ukraine]{.underline} in reality [is **on its own against**
Russia]{.underline}, no matter how many Western sanctions are
implemented or how much material is provided. Other nations will take
note of this.

[Reflection **does not seem to be in order** though, as the US has
**threatened nations** who have **refused to sanction Russia**. The most
profound outcome of such threats may be a reconciliation of **India with
China**, and a closer relationship between India and]{.underline} its
erstwhile ally [Russia]{.underline}. This is not 1995, and [the West can
**no longer push nations**]{.underline} such as India [around without
**significant blowback**]{.underline}.

After the Cuban missile crisis, the US leadership realized that it must
treat the Soviet Union with some respect if nuclear war was to be
averted. [The West must now learn to **respect other nation's security
needs**]{.underline} if it wants to avoid becoming increasingly
separated from the rest of the world. As the philosopher Mike Tyson put
it so well, "**[Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the
mouth]{.underline}**." [The Russian invasion is the West's punch in the
mouth]{.underline}, and [it **desperately needs a new
plan**]{.underline}.

One reason why [China could be seen as a **bigger challenger** than
Russia]{.underline} is [because of]{.underline} its
**[GDP]{.underline}**. Nitin J Ticku, a defense expert and managing
editor of the EurAsian Times says --- [forget **Russia**, even the
**USSR** was never as rich as China is today. Chinese]{.underline}
military [spending is **roughly four times that of Russia**]{.underline}
[and could **bypass the overall American economy** in a decade. These
are ominous signs for the US.]{.underline}

The major difference between the two US adversaries is --- [Russia is
interested in **territorial gains that would allow it to secure its
frontiers from an expansionist NATO**]{.underline} and, [China, on the
other hand,]{.underline} [**seeks to dominate the international
landscape** and **wrest the hegemony that has been held by the US**
since the collapse of the Soviet Union]{.underline}.

[China has been marching towards regions that have traditionally been
the American sphere of influence]{.underline} and [**threatening the
status quo**, which is often seen as a threat to]{.underline} the
security of the [regional US allies]{.underline}.

Closer home, [China has territorial disputes with several South-East
Asian countries in the South China Sea. Beijing claims]{.underline}
practically **[the entire region]{.underline}** and has used
intimidation as a tactic to corner the smaller states (aligned with the
US) that i[t has disputes with]{.underline} --- including [the
Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei. It has built **artificial
islands**]{.underline} to further secure its ownership and militarized
them, against warnings.

A controversy had erupted when a US admiral revealed in March that
Chi[na had fully **militarized three islands**]{.underline} in the
region with anti-ship and anti-missile systems -- understood as an
attempt [to bolster its **A2/AD capability**.]{.underline}

In its neighborhood, [China remains marred in a border conflict
with]{.underline} the strategic partner of the United States and the
cornerstone of the Indo-Pacific policy, **[India]{.underline}**.

Both nations fought a brief but bitter war in 1962 and recently were
involved in a bloody confrontation along the disputed Himalayan border.

Besides, [China is also arming]{.underline} India's bitter enemy,
[Pakistan with cutting-edge equipment to challenge India's
influence]{.underline} in the region, cultivating Islamabad's Navy to
function as a PLA proxy until Beijing can exponentially enhance its
presence in the Indian Ocean region (IOR).

[China has also constructed a military base in]{.underline} Africa on
[Djibouti]{.underline} Island [and is expanding]{.underline} far and
wide into the African continent [through]{.underline} its Belt and Road
Initiative ([BRI]{.underline}). Africa has traditionally been in the
British, French, and American spheres of influence.

Though Indo-Pacific rivals led by the US have come up with a
counter-initiative called [the Blue Dot Network]{.underline}, they [are
**still years away**]{.underline} from reaching the scale of investment
and trade that Beijing currently enjoys. Its (Chinese) massive capital
and military power have been instrumental in its quest to Africa.

However, the most significant flashpoint between the US and China goes
through the Taiwan Strait. [China has vowed to **reunite Taiwan** with
the **Chinese mainland**, with]{.underline} **[force]{.underline}** if
necessary.

Despite accepting the One-China policy, [the US has **extended military
support to Taipei**]{.underline} and remains the biggest obstacle for
China to gobble Taiwan.

[Another major stakeholder]{.underline} in the Taiwan issue
[is]{.underline} a staunch US ally, **[Japan]{.underline}**. By its
location close to Taiwan, [any aggression]{.underline} against the
island state [is expected to draw **Japan into the
conflict**]{.underline} [which could risk a **direct military
confrontation** between China and the US.]{.underline}

According to Pacific Commander in the US Air Force, Kenneth Wilsbach,
[China has very sophisticated Anti-Access/Area-Denial
capabilities]{.underline} along its coast to repel any possible attack
on itself. [If an armed confrontation was to take place between the US
and China, the latter would have a **homeland advantage
against**]{.underline} the US.

[Another region]{.underline} where China's growing influence
[is]{.underline} threatening the US and its ally,
**[Australia]{.underline}**, is the Pacific region. [China recently
concluded a security pact with the Solomon Islands which has raised
concerns about a potential military base just about **2,000 kilometers
from Australia**]{.underline}.

[China's growing influence among the]{.underline} Pacific Island
Countries ([PIC]{.underline}) [also threatens the **existing regional
order**]{.underline} where Canberra is the first responder.

Further, China has also stationed missiles like the DF-26 that threaten
American assets as far as Guam, which hosts a critical American military
base in the region.

The heat has been felt by Australia which is now in the process of
developing its nuke submarine equipped with nuclear propulsion
technology sourced from the US and the UK under the AUKUS agreement. The
three partners will also cooperate on the development of hypersonic
missiles as was announced recently.

[China has also made inroads into the **Latin American region**, riding
on the plank of the]{.underline} [B]{.underline}elt and
[R]{.underline}oad [I]{.underline}nitiative. [The region is the **United
States' backyard** where it has historically exerted
influence]{.underline} and on several occasions, even by suppressing
popular movements.

[Chinese investment and its **growing influence in the Caribbean
region**]{.underline} [is a **clear red line**]{.underline} given that
Venezuela and Cuba already favor Russia.

In a surprising turn of events, [China has also now reached as far as
**Siberia** in Europe]{.underline}. In a semi-secret mission that took
place earlier, Chinese transport aircraft YJ-20 delivered surface to air
missile system to Siberia passing through Turkish and the airspace of
other European nations.

A common pattern among all these regions is [the Chinese ambition of
**dismantling the existing world order** to **slowly make space for
itself next to the US**]{.underline} [and then gradually assuming the
role of a **global hegemon**]{.underline} -- a reputation that has so
far only been enjoyed by the United States.

On top of that, [the fact that **China is a close ally of Russia** is
also detrimental to the interests of the US. It has issued several
warnings to China against supplementing Russia or helping it circumvent
global sanctions]{.underline} but doubts persist.

[China has]{.underline} not only refused to condemn Russia for the
invasion of Ukraine but also [reinforced its relationship with
Moscow]{.underline}.

China's Robust Military Advancement

[China's stupendous military rise has unsettled the United States whose
military prowess is being **constantly challenged**]{.underline} by the
People's Liberation Army.

A US Congressional report had earlier mentioned that [the Chinese Navy
has]{.underline} the [largest]{.underline} naval [fleet]{.underline} by
size. [China]{.underline}, according to US Navy Chief Admiral Michael
Gilday, [is]{.underline} a **[formidable]{.underline}** military enemy
[that is constantly developing and achieving its goals **years ahead of
schedule**, **putting pressure**]{.underline} on the US Navy.

The US Air Force has also accepted China's air prowess. US Air Force
Chief Charles Brown had earlier said that China would be able to surpass
the US Air dominance by 2035. He had said that [the PLA had "the largest
aviation forces in the Pacific]{.underline}" and had created them
"underneath our nose".

A domain where [the US trails behind]{.underline} not just
[China]{.underline} but also Russia is [the **hypersonic weapons
program**. Both China and Russia have operational hypersonic
missiles]{.underline}, with Russia even using its missile in the
Ukrainian invasion.

However, [the US is **still some time away**]{.underline} from fielding
a weapon. However, efforts are on to achieve that objective in full
earnest and the HAWC test conducted by the US secretly in the recent
past was hailed as a success.

[The US faces a]{.underline} serious [challenge from China, even **in
space**]{.underline}. After the International Space Station retires
sometime around 2030, China could be the only country to operate a space
station, that too single-handedly.

So while [the US]{.underline} is having to dole out significant
resources for Ukraine, it [recognizes the threat from Russia **will not
last forever** and that the **Chinese dragon is only going to get bigger
and bigger**]{.underline}.

### AT: Deterrence\-\--Mearsheimer\-\--2NC 

#### Mearsheimer is a [contradictory joker]{.underline}. Walt is the [savior]{.underline} of realism. 

Peter **Henne 22**, Associate Prof of Political Science at the U of
Vermont, 3-3-2022, \"A tale of two realisms,\"
https://www.duckofminerva.com/2022/03/a-tale-of-two-realisms.html, jy

[It's been a **rough week for John Mearsheimer**. He has come under a
barrage of criticism]{.underline} for his claim that Russia's aggression
towards Ukraine is the West's fault. His theoretical tradition, realism,
has also come under fire, for producing not only (arguably) bad policy
takes but policy takes that don't seem to flow from the theory itself.
[Does this mean that **all of realism is flawed?**]{.underline} I would
argue **[no]{.underline}**, by pointing to another target of such
claims, Stephen Walt. This says something about how to make/keep realism
relevant.

THE TROUBLE WITH REALISM?

Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Mearsheimer's statements on
US-Russian tensions circulated widely on Twitter; he argued that the
post-Cold War expansion of NATO threatened Russia, leading to Putin's
aggressive moves. After Russia's invasion, as the world pulled together
in opposition to Russia's actions, he became the target of widespread
criticism for his views, as encapsulated by this New Yorker interview.

Most are critiquing his policy prescriptions, but some are taking aim at
his academic work. What does it say about offensive realism, which
Mearsheimer championed, if it produces policy takes such as this? What
does it say about realism in general? The issue isn't just that many of
us disagree with his policy views, it's that they don't seem to connect
at all with his theory. [Mearsheimer argued that states will
**inevitably seek to expand their power**]{.underline}, as this is the
only way they can be assured of their security. This expansion will
continue until they are balanced by a countervailing force or come up
against geographic boundaries. [The idea that Russia's security could be
assured with promises]{.underline} from America, thus [undermining
Russia's aggressive tendencies, seems like something **Mearsheimer
should argue against**.]{.underline}

This has drawn in another famous realist, Stephen Walt. Several
critiques of Mearsheimer list Walt alongside him (just search the two
names together on Twitter). Like Mearsheimer, Walt has become a public
intellectual and at times has advanced policy views that do not seem to
fit with his academic work, in his case defensive realism. Defensive
realism accepts that [states **can achieve security**, with
**international tensions emerging from misperceptions** or **systemic
destabilizing factors**.]{.underline}

[MEARSHEIMER'S POLICY TAKES ARE A **BLATANT CONTRADICTION OF HIS
ACADEMIC WORK**. WALT'S THEREOTICAL ELABORATIONS ON
REALISM]{.underline}, HOWEVER, [ALLOW FOR A **RICHER POLICY
ANALYSIS**]{.underline}.

A few of his policy works seem to contradict this. There is the famous
(infamous) "Mearsheimer and Walt" book, The Israel Lobby and US Foreign
Policy. Beyond being controversial for its depiction of a unified
"Israel lobby," many pointed to the irony of two structural realists
claiming domestic politics drives US foreign policy. In Walt's Taming
American Power (a book I find excellent, and which I assign in my Intro
to IR classes) he discusses the importance of things like the United
Nations and normative legitimacy. And in his periodic columns on foreign
policy he has argued realism can explain issues it has ignored, like
public health.

So here we have two academic realists who seem to depart from their
scholarly theories when they are incapable of explaining current events.
They do so, it seems, by adding ad hoc extensions to their theory or
abandoning its core foundations altogether. This is the sort of
Lakatosian regressive research program Andrew Bennett warned us about in
our PhD seminars at Georgetown.

But I'm not sure this is fair to Walt.

IN DEFENSE OF STEPHEN WALT

I have been critical of Walt, such as when he claimed realism can
explain Covid-19. And I've been critical of the paradigms in general, as
I think they don't reflect current trends in the study of international
relations. But I think it's unfair to lump Walt in with Mearsheimer.

Let's compare their heresies. [Mearsheimer went from arguing that states
will constantly seek power to arguing states will only be aggressive if
others make them feel insecure. That is a **blatant
contradiction**]{.underline}, and we should call it out as such.
[Walt]{.underline}, however, [has argued that **revolutions** and the
**intentions of a state can influence how threatening it
appears**]{.underline}. More generally, this encompasses domestic
factors--instability and foreign policy orientation independent of
structural position--and ideas such as revolutionary ideologies and the
aforementioned foreign policy orientation.

LET'S ALL CRITICIZE MEARSHEIMER. BUT LEAVE REALISM OUT OF IT.

Some have criticized Walt over these elaborations on realism, arguing it
weakens the theory and demonstrates its unsuitability. But I would argue
it strengthens it, by expanding on the things that matter in
international relations (which is actually more in line with structural
realism's classical realist roots). And it creates a theoretical
foundation for a richer foreign policy analysis. If domestic instability
or preferences can matter in international relations, why not domestic
lobbying groups? If ideological orientations can influence how
threatening a state is, then why can't shared international beliefs do
the same? Admittedly, it's harder to reconcile his recognition of the
UN's importance (although if someone has an example where he theorized
this, let me know). He's even admitted he was wrong on things like
culture.

This matters for assessing the usefulness of academic realism in both
policy and academic debates. Realists argue that states are
self-interested and insecure, giving rise to a tense and uncertain
international system. Walt's work demonstrates the variety of forms this
tension can take, and the possibility of reducing (but never
eliminating) it. This allows for a rich policy analysis. Mearsheimer
rejects anything beyond the pursuit of material power, which gives him
little with which to analyze international relations.

On the academic side, [there's **nowhere really to go with offensive
realism**]{.underline}. You just find cases of states balancing based on
power. [As **more** and **more studies show**]{.underline}, however,
[that **isn't really the norm.** Defensive realism provides more
options]{.underline}, while Walt's policy work provides suggestions for
how to incorporate normative concerns and international organizations
into the study of power politics. Instead of rejecting realism, [we
should **deepen these theoretical connections**]{.underline}. One good
approach (although one of the authors may recoil at me comparing his
work to Walt's) is Goddard and Nexon's work on power politics.

Either way, [let's **all criticize Mearsheimer**. But **leave realism
out of it**.]{.underline}

#### China will [outpace]{.underline} the Russian nuclear arsenal.

WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - [China, in the midst of a **rapid nuclear
weapons buildup**, will soon surpass **Russia** as the]{.underline}
United States\' [top nuclear threat, a senior U.S. military official
said]{.underline} on Friday, warning that [the two countries have **no
mechanisms to avert miscommunication**]{.underline}.

U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Thomas [Bussiere, the deputy commander
of the U.S. Strat]{.underline}egic [Comm]{.underline}and[, which
oversees the country\'s nuclear arsenal, said China\'s development of
nuclear capabilities \"**can no longer be aligned**]{.underline}\" with
its public claim [that it wants to maintain a minimum nuclear
deterrent.]{.underline}

\"There\'s going to be a point, a crossover point, where [the number of
threats presented by China will **exceed**]{.underline} the number of
threats that currently [Russia]{.underline} presents,\" Bussiere told an
online forum.

He said the determination would not be based solely on the number of
Beijing\'s stockpiled nuclear warheads, but also on how they are
\"operationally fielded.\"

\"There will be a crossover point, we believe, [in the **next few
years**]{.underline},\" Bussiere said.

Unlike with Russia, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [did
not have **any treaties** or **dialogue mechanism** with China on the
issue to \"alleviate]{.underline} any [misperceptions or
confusion]{.underline},\" he added.

Bussiere\'s comments come as the United States is attempting to realign
its foreign policy to put greater emphasis in the Indo-Pacific region to
counter China\'s growing economic and military might.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed deep concern about
China\'s growing nuclear arsenal during a meeting with foreign ministers

The Arrival of Putin: [Conciliation Fails **Amid NATO
Provocations**]{.underline}

When Vladimir Putin came to power in January 2000, relations between
Russia and NATO were at a very low ebb. Yet far from exhibiting any
anti-Western tendencies, Putin initially attempted to facilitate
rapprochement between Russia and the West. Putin characterised NATO as a
minimal threat to Russia's security, and even went as far as to suggest
that Russia may still consider joining the alliance in the right
circumstances.\[26\] NATO responded with a conciliatory gesture of its
own, establishing the NATO-Russia Council in November 2001.\[27\]
However, Putin's overtures failed to dampen the alliance's expansionist
zeal.

From 2003 to 2005 [the West extended its **influence
further**]{.underline} into Eastern Europe by [aiding revolutions
against pro-Russian regimes in]{.underline} Georgia and the
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**. Between 1993 and 2003, \$700 million in US
aid and \$420 million European Union (EU) aid was directed into
Georgia.\[28\] Most of this money was channeled through Western NGOs and
was used toward electoral and judicial reform and citizen mobilisation.

Vote rigging by Georgia's pro-Russian government in 2003 sparked
widespread protests against the incumbent President Eduard Shevardnadze.
Western NGOs played a key role in financing opposition parties and
organising demonstrations.\[29\] When popular pressure forced
Shevardnadze to resign, he was succeeded by the pro-NATO Mikhail
Saakashvili. Voter fraud orchestrated by the Ukraine's pro-Russian
President, Victor Yanukovich, in 2004 sparked similar protests in the
Ukraine. Again, state-funded Western NGOs played a central role in
mobilising anti-government demonstrators. Protestors were entertained
with rock music, provided with free food and tent accommodation and even
paid small amounts of money for attending rallies.\[30\] When popular
pressure prompted Ukraine's Supreme Court to annul the election result
and order a revote, the Western-backed Victor Yushchenko was elected
President.

In March 2004 [NATO accepted]{.underline} seven new member states
including [the three Baltic states]{.underline}. For the first time,
[NATO was **right on Russia's border**.]{.underline} \[31\] [Twelve
hundred miles had separated Saint Petersburg from NATO during the Cold
War]{.underline}, but [that distance had been reduced to **less than one
hundred miles**]{.underline}. Later that year Georgia and the Ukraine
signed Individual Partnership Action Plans, and [joint NATO-Ukraine
military exercises in Crimea **soon followed**]{.underline}.\[32\]

Whilst Putin downplayed the importance of these events, others in his
administration expressed much alarm. Foreign Minister Sergei [Lavrov
warned "we cannot, of course, watch impartially the military structure
of the alliance moving ever closer to our borders]{.underline}."\[33\]
[It was **quite reasonable** for the Kremlin to view NATO's
incorporation of the Baltic States as an **outright
threat**]{.underline}. Unlike the existing NATO members and former
Warsaw Pact states, [the]{.underline} 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe
([CFE]{.underline}) Treaty, which was designed to prevent any country
from amassing the weaponry required to launch an offensive war,
**[didn't bind the Baltic nations]{.underline}**.\[34\] [NATO now held
the legal right to deploy an **unlimited quantity of
troops**]{.underline} and military hardware in the Baltic.\[35\] Plans
were made for the Baltic states to accede to an adapted CFE treaty, but
a series of diplomatic stalemates resulted in the US and its NATO allies
refusing to ratify the new agreement.\[36\]

In 2007, the [Bush]{.underline} Administration [announced plans to
construct a missile defence shield]{.underline} in Eastern Europe.\[37\]
The pretext for this decision was that it was necessary to protect
Europe from an Iranian nuclear attack. However, [Moscow quickly realised
that the shield would have the potential to undermine and perhaps even
neutralise Russia's nuclear deterrent.]{.underline} Putin suggested an
alternative, namely the construction of a joint Russia-US radar warning
system in Azerbaijan, but the US rejected this proposal.\[38\] At this
point, [Putin was **forced to abandon his conciliatory
approach**.]{.underline} In his 2007 State of the Nation Address, the
Russian President characterised NATO as, "a real threat".\[39\] Russia
formally suspended its observance of its CFE treaty obligations a month
later.

At a summit [in]{.underline} Bucharest in [April 2008, NATO released a
statement affirming that Georgia and the Ukraine would be offered
membership]{.underline}.\[40\] US pressure was the chief driver of this
decision, as several Western European alliance members expressed
opposition to the plan.\[41\]

[This was NATO's **most threatening and provocative move towards Russia
yet**. Ukraine]{.underline}, as the biggest country is Europe,
[constitutes an important **strategic buffer** between Russia and NATO.
Napoleonic France, Wilhelmine Germany, and Nazi Germany all invaded
Russia through southeastern Europe and consequently, the Kremlin is
**extremely reticent to allow the armies of those countries to once
again be stationed there**.]{.underline} Georgia borders Russia's
volatile Caucasus region, already rife with minority nationalism and
secessionist sentiment. Furthermore, both Georgia and the Ukraine are
proximate to Russia's Volga region, its agricultural heartland and its
access point for Caspian Sea oil. The Kremlin cannot and will not risk
its control over these assets being compromised.

The Fight over Georgia and the Ukraine: Russia's Militarist Turn

It was only a matter of time before tension between Russia and NATO over
the status of Georgia and the Ukraine spilled over into conflict. After
winning wars of secession against Georgia in the early 1990s, the
breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia had enjoyed de facto
independence from Tbilisi.\[42\] Both had been reliant on Russia for
strategic and financial support, though Russia still formally recognised
them as part of Georgia. In May of 2008, when Georgian President Mikhail
Saakashvili requested that Russian peacekeepers in Abkhazia be withdrawn
and replaced by either EU or NATO forces, Russia responded by increasing
the size of its force.\[43\] In June, Georgia detained Russian
peacekeepers stationed in Abkhazia. Then on August 7 Georgia launched an
attack on South Ossetia, killing numerous civilians and 12 Russian
soldiers.\[44\] A day later, Russia sent ground troops into the
secessionist territories and began bombing Georgian military and
industrial targets. After five days of fighting, Moscow forced Tbilisi
to agree to a ceasefire on Russian terms. Russia formally recognised the
two breakaway polities as sovereign nations and announced that a force
of 7,600 would remain in the territories indefinitely for their
"protection".\[45\]

Russia's strong-arming of Georgia was the Kremlin's way of signaling to
NATO that it would not tolerate any further expansion of the alliance.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev evoked a siege mentality, stating
that "we do not have any illusion of partnership \[with NATO\]...
Naturally we are not happy with being surrounded by military
bases."\[46\]

Russia's war succeeded, as NATO's plans to extend membership to Georgia
were put on an indefinite hold. The alliance could hardly incorporate
Georgia when Tbilisi had no sovereignty over 20 percent of its
territory. Nonetheless, the West continued to put geostrategic pressure
on Russia. NATO suspended the Russia-NATO Council, established a
permanent military presence in the Baltic and, in December 2009, refused
a Russian proposal to replace the CFE treaty.\[47\] In 2010 the US
relocated a Patriot missile battery from Germany to Poland and, in 2012,
opened phase one of its European Missile Defence Shield.\[48\]

With tensions high and the issue of Ukraine's NATO membership still
unresolved, another conflict always seemed likely. Ukrainian society is
deeply divided between pro-Russian and pro-Western segments, and voting
in the country tends to follow this division.\[49\] The Westernisation
of Ukraine had been stalled by the election of the pro-Russian Victor
Yanukovich in 2010. On 25 November 2013, Yanukovich delayed his decision
to sign an Association Agreement with the EU which would have forced the
Ukraine to sever all economic ties with Russia. Instead, Yanukovich
signed a deal with Russia whereby the Kremlin would buy \$15 billion of
Ukrainian bonds and cut its gas prices to the country by one
third.\[50\] This decision angered pro-Western Ukrainians, who took to
the streets in protest.

As civil unrest grew, police began to crack down violently on
demonstrators.\[51\] On the 21 February 2014, after three months of
protests, Yanukovich fled to Russia and, in what can only be described
as a coup, a new pro-Western government took power in Kiev.\[52\] The
full extent of US involvement in the coup is at this stage unknown, but
a leaked conversation between US assistant secretary of state for
European and Eurasian affairs Victoria Nuland and US Ambassador to the
Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt suggests it could have been substantial. During
the conversation, Nuland expressed her support for regime change in
Ukraine and her desire to see Arseniy Yatsenyuk become the country's new
Prime Minister -- which he did.\[53\]

Russian troops moved into the Crimean Peninsular on 22 February. Putin
chose to take Crimea primarily because it contains the strategically
important Black Sea port of Sevastopol, which Russia had been leasing
from the Ukraine since the end of the Cold War.\[54\] The annexation of
Crimea was a warning that Moscow would not tolerate the Ukraine slipping
out of its orbit. On the day of the Crimean annexation, Putin warned
NATO not to "make itself at home in our backyard or in our historical
territory."\[55\] Russia then orchestrated a proxy war in Eastern
Ukraine, arming pro-Russian rebels and probably also deploying several
hundred Special Forces soldiers in Eastern Ukraine to aid them.\[56\] In
May, Ukraine elected a pro-Western government that renounced the
country's non-aligned status and signaled its desire to join NATO.\[57\]

Russia's militarist tactics were once again successful in stalling
NATO's advance. In March 2016, European Commission President Jean-Claude
Juncker affirmed that the Ukraine would not gain NATO membership within
the next two decades.\[58\] However, since 2014, NATO and the Ukraine
have conducted numerous joint military exercises and NATO has committed
\$5.4 million to assist with the modernisation of Ukraine's army.\[59\]
The alliance has also increased its troop presence in the Baltic and
conducted a military parade in Estonia less than a kilometer from
Russian territory.\[60\] In 2016, the US completed phase two of its
missile defence shield, opening a weapons system in Romania and
announcing that a similar system will be opened in Poland in 2018.\[61\]
Russia, meanwhile, has ensured that Eastern Ukraine remains in a state
of frozen conflict and has effectively consolidated its control over
South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\[62\]

Russia and NATO: Where to Next?

Winston Churchill once famously remarked that Russia is, "a riddle
wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma."\[63\] However, since the end of
the Cold War at least, the [Russian mindset has been **remarkably easy
to understand**]{.underline}.

[Russia regards NATO]{.underline}, the world's most powerful military
alliance, [as a dire threa]{.underline}t the [\[to\] its security.
Russia's goal of trying to halt NATO's eastward march is rooted in a
**defensive realist view of international politics**. The Kremlin is
attempting to **safeguard its security**]{.underline}; it is [**not**
looking to **reclaim lost status** or **recapture an
empire**]{.underline}. Analysts such as Derk Eppink have contended that,
"Putin's mind-set is largely rooted in the 19th century. Politics \[for
him\] is about power."\[64\] Those who dismiss this worldview as
outdated would do well to remember that [Russia was **almost destroyed
twice in twentieth century**]{.underline} by invasions through Eastern
Europe. At least [twenty-seven million Russians were killed during WWII,
roughly one third of the war's overall death toll]{.underline}.\[65\]
[It should hardly be surprising that a **sense of vulnerability** still
**pervades Russian strategic thinking today**]{.underline}.

It is also worth noting that the US' worldview is not significantly
different to that of Russia. [The US has pursued the Monroe
Doctrine]{.underline} for almost two centuries, often [**employing
violence** and **subverting democracy**]{.underline} to prevent foreign
powers from establishing a presence in the Americas.\[66\] As John
Mearsheimer explains, "this is Geopolitics 101: [great powers are
**always sensitive to potential threats near their home
territory**]{.underline}... [Imagine the American outrage if China built
an impressive military alliance and tried to include **Canada** and
**Mexico**]{.underline}."\[67\]

As the Ukraine continues to suffer through a protracted civil war, what
can be done to ameliorate the tension between Russia and NATO and
restore stability in Eastern Europe? Stephen Walt proposes that NATO
should strike a deal with Ukraine and Russia that enshrines the status
of the Ukraine as a non-aligned buffer state.\[68\] Striking a similar
deal regarding Georgia would also be prudent. Furthermore, NATO should
support the incumbent government in Ukraine, whilst at the same time
discouraging it from adopting a provocative stance towards Russia.

Crimea will never be returned to the Ukraine, but NATO may be able to
help the Ukraine regain sovereignty over its war torn eastern provinces
by encouraging Kiev to cooperate with Moscow. Additionally, the US
should discontinue its plans to expand its missile defence shield in
Europe. This is a misguided policy that incentivises Russia to increase
its reliance on tactical nuclear weapons and risks sparking another
nuclear arms race. Paradoxically, Europe is safer without the shield.

Finally, NATO should propose a replacement to the CFE treaty and
guarantee that its nuclear arsenal will move no closer to Russia's
borders. In return for these assurances, Russia may be willing to
downsize its nuclear armoury in Kaliningrad or even make concessions on
the status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

[With neither side having **shown much interest in diplomacy so far**,

### NATO Key\-\--2AC/1AR

#### Nato is key to deterring Putin\-\-- collapse causes global insecurity.

The conventional wisdom in Washington is that NATO should refrain from
enforcing a No-Fly Zone over Ukraine due to the risk of an all-out
NATO-Russia war. This view reflects a decades-long misunderstanding of
both Russia and Ukraine, and is mired in appeasement thinking. While the
window to impose a No-Fly Zone has likely closed, there are still
alternatives that could work. The West should implement them without
delay. After the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, the US hastily
abandoned the post-Soviet world and moved on to other international
challenges. Ironically, this disinvestment meant that it stopped
maintaining and developing the very expertise that had allowed America
to triumph over the USSR in the first place. Over the intervening three
decades, appeasement has replaced expertise. [Whether it was Russia's
brutal wars in Chechnya, the 2008 war with Georgia, or the 2014 invasion
of Crimea and eastern Ukraine, the West's approach has frequently been
shaped by fear of provoking an already aggrieved Russia]{.underline}.
[This has led the West to misread Putin's Russia again and
again]{.underline}. It also caused Western leaders to misinterpret
developments in Ukraine. [We overestimate Putin and underestimate
Ukraine]{.underline} due to limited understanding of the fast-changing
dynamics in the post-Soviet region. [The West's dangerous disregard for
the threat posed by a revanchist Kremlin explains why the democratic
world did not maintain its advantage over Russia when the latter was
most vulnerable]{.underline}. The fall of the Soviet Union provided a
golden opportunity for rapid NATO expansion, including into Ukraine.
[While it is fashionable to claim NATO enlargement went too far, in the
current circumstances it makes far more sense to argue that it did not
go far enough]{.underline}. Thankfully, [it is not too late for the West
to learn from its mistakes]{.underline}. [While Russia has significantly
greater military power today than in the 1990s]{.underline}, [it is
still no match for NATO]{.underline}, and **[Putin will not fight if
challenged by the collective might of the West]{.underline}**. [NATO
could coordinate with non-NATO nations to protect Ukraine's
skies]{.underline}, especially as the Biden Administration has
demonstrated its ability in recent weeks to unify the world against
Russia. America could theoretically mobilize a broad coalition to
protect Ukraine. In the current extreme circumstances, there is no
reason why the global community cannot adopt a creative approach to save
a country that has been blatantly attacked by a permanent member of the
UN Security Council and has stunned the world with its heroism. Retired
four-star General in the United States Air Force Phil Breedlove has
stated that a No-Fly Zone must be on the table. He also suggested an
alternative: a humanitarian No-Fly Zone. This is a potentially
attractive idea that could serve as a compromise between advocates of a
cautious policy towards the Kremlin and those who believe [Russia will
not ultimately escalate into open war with NATO]{.underline}. While
Western leaders have so far been unambiguous in ruling out direct
intervention, they are also providing Ukraine with enhanced
anti-aircraft capabilities. Such measures need to be significantly
speeded up and bolstered by the parallel provision of fighter jets and
anti-missile defense systems. In less than four weeks of war, Russia has
fired more than a thousand missiles at Ukraine and reduced entire
Ukrainian cities to rubble. While the civilian death toll remains
unconfirmed, many thousands are already feared dead. Despite the obvious
urgency of the situation, the West is still acting in half-measures and
contemplating if arming Ukraine could be interpreted as provocative by
Putin. [If Western leaders maintain their current cautious approach
towards Russian aggression, the watching world will witness an unfolding
genocide of the Ukrainian people]{.underline}. This will be joined by a
rapidly escalating global food crisis. Russian tanks will not stop at
Ukraine's western borders. On the contrary, [Putin will be emboldened to
expand his wars of imperial aggression and will inevitably turn his
attention to Moldova and the Baltic States]{.underline} while also
seeking to destabilize Central Europe and the Balkans. Meanwhile, [China
and other authoritarian powers will take note of Putin's
success]{.underline} and act accordingly. They will forge closer ties
with a resurgent Russia and will seek to [expand their own spheres of
influence]{.underline} in a similar manner[. The entire world will enter
into a new era of global insecurity]{.underline} that will reverse much
of the progress made since World War II. Rather than remaining reactive
and paying an even greater price in the near future, [NATO should act
decisively now and dramatically]{.underline} increase its support for
Ukraine. To do otherwise is not only immoral; it is against the core
strategic interests of the entire Western world.

#### Aff is key to deterring Russia.

NATO and Deter Putin's Aggression,"
https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/17/new-nato-21st-century-revitalize-putin-00032744//ZW\]

As Vladimir [Putin made]{.underline} clear in his recent Victory Day
speech, [the war in Ukraine will grind on for years]{.underline}. Even
[if Russia]{.underline} ultimately [retreats]{.underline}, [this won't
lead to a lasting peace]{.underline}. During the Cold War, Western
Europe could confidently rely on American military power to deter Soviet
aggression. This is no longer true. And [Putin]{.underline} and his
successors [will continue to exploit]{.underline} this fact --- unless
and [until NATO decisively reorganizes itself]{.underline}. The United
States and Europe are understandably wary of engaging in direct conflict
with Russia, but they can still do more than provide short-term
assistance to Ukraine. [Now is the time to start taking steps to
establish NATO as a credible force for the defense of Western
democracy]{.underline} in the 21st century. [Bold measures are
required]{.underline}, including dramatically revising the NATO treaty,
raising an army in Europe and even expelling countries who have betrayed
their democratic commitments. [But it's the best way to deter the
Kremlin and ultimately avoid more brutal wars in the
future]{.underline}. European democracies have resisted this path in the
past, but the only realistic response to the attack on Ukraine is to
construct their own powerful army as part of a reorganized NATO. The
Ukraine tragedy has generated dramatic increases in European defense
budgets, but this is only the first step toward building a large and
permanent fighting force that could take the field against future
Russian invasions of NATO members in the Baltic --- or Finland or Sweden
once they join the alliance. [While the Europeans can continue to rely
on American air and naval power, they themselves must be prepared to
take the leading role in their own defense on the ground]{.underline}.
[This won't happen unless Europeans rapidly commit themselves
to]{.underline} a concrete action plan that requires each [NATO member
to fulfill strong and specific military obligations]{.underline} on an
annual basis. No less important, governments must place their troops
under the control of a unified command structure. If each country sends
its fighters into the field under its own national commander, their
separate forces would be overwhelmed by coordinated Russian assaults,
especially in an era of lightning-fast weapons. This raises a very real
institution-building challenge for the continent's political leaders.
Only the European Union is in a realistic position to organize a
broad-based military effort. Its parliament is directly elected by the
citizens of all the states in the Union. After each election, the
majority of delegates choose an executive commission --- currently led
by Ursula von der Leyen --- to make key policy decisions. This body has
the precious democratic legitimacy required to embark on such an
unprecedented military initiative. At present, however, [the treaties
defining the powers of the EU don't grant the Union any war-making
authority whatsoever]{.underline}. Before the commission can step into
the breach, another key institution --- the Council of Ministers ---
must propose revisions that empower the commission to move forward with
its rigorous demands upon the member states. The council consists of the
chief executives of each country. But fortunately, its current leader is
Emmanuel Macron --- who staked his presidential campaign against Marine
Le Pen on an emphatically continental vision of France's future. Many
commentators have downplayed Macron's achievement by emphasizing Le
Pen's success in generating popular support for her hard-right
nationalist program. Yet the fact remains that Macron is the first
French president who has won a second term in office in the last 20
years --- and he did so by a decisive 59-41 margin. The French president
is the continental leader with the strongest democratic mandate to
expand the EU treaties to authorize collaboration with NATO to confront
the Russian military threat. Indeed, Macron has already stated that
"\[i\]n the coming weeks, we need to bring to being a European proposal
to forge a new security and stability order. We need to build it between
Europeans, then share it with our allies in the NATO framework." Here is
where Joe Biden can play a crucial role. He should not only publicly
encourage Macron and von der Leyen to begin the hard bargaining required
to enact the dramatic revisions to EU law required before a European
army can become a reality. [Since the reorganization of NATO also
requires America's consent to treaty revisions, Biden should immediately
announce his strong support for the necessary changes]{.underline}.
Normally, of course, it is virtually impossible to win the two-thirds
Senate majority needed for treaty revisions. The Ukraine bloodbath,
however, has dramatically transformed the political situation. With
Macron and von der Leyen embarking on their own intensive efforts to
reconstruct NATO, [Biden will be in a strong position to gain the
bipartisan support of a supermajority]{.underline} --- especially since
the Europeans are now prepared, at long last, to pay their fair share of
the overall defense effort. [It will take a lot of hard
work]{.underline} to develop a concrete action program for the new
continental army and assure its effective implementation in each of the
states of the European Union. [If serious efforts to lay the legal
foundations don't start immediately, Europe won't have a realistic
chance of putting a fighting force on the ground by 2030]{.underline}.
[Even if Democrats lose control of the Senate in 2022]{.underline},
[this will be one of the rare issues where Capitol Hill will likely
stand behind the president]{.underline}. In the meantime, Secretary of
State Antony Blinken and his team can offer concrete help to Macron and
von der Leyen in their ambitious campaign to gain broad-based political
support for the reconstruction of NATO on their side of the Atlantic.
Even with America's help, their success is by no means assured. At best,
it will take a year or two of wheeling-and-dealing before EU leaders can
gain the legal authority to develop a concrete action program and assure
its effective enforcement in each of the states of the European Union.
Nevertheless, [there will never be a better time to make this
effort]{.underline} --- [and if it succeeds, Putin and his successors
will confront a decisive deterrent]{.underline}. In giving their strong
support to the European effort, however, Biden and the Senate should
also insist that the new NATO remain faithful to its founding
principles. In particular, when the treaty was first signed in 1949,
NATO members attached a fundamental condition to their pledge of mutual
military assistance. They made it clear that they would come to a
country's defense only if its government was making a good-faith effort
to "strengthen their free institutions." Otherwise, it could not rely on
its NATO allies to come to its defense against attack. Seventy-five
years later, it is painfully apparent that some NATO countries are
working to destroy freedom rather than strengthen it. Turkey is the most
obvious example. Over the past decade, it has been transformed into an
authoritarian state by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Worse yet, Erdoğan sent his
army to help Syria's despotic regime fight NATO's troops --- battling
against the very alliance he and his predecessors had pledged to
support. Since Turkey is neither a reliable ally nor a defender of "free
institutions," Biden and the Senate should refuse to sign a treaty that
continues to recognize it as a NATO member. Hungary is a tougher case.
Like Erdoğan, Viktor Orbán has used his time in office to create an
"illiberal democracy," which decisively undermines NATO's founding
commitment to freedom. Moreover, when he was running for reelection
during the early days of the Ukraine war, he condemned Ukraine's
president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, "as an enemy of the Hungarian nation"
and campaigned on a platform that opposed any EU sanctions against
Russia for its invasion. He then used his control of the mass media to
deny his opponents a fair opportunity to challenge his celebration of
Putin's aggression. As a consequence, Orbán's "landslide" victory at the
polls only dramatizes his success in entrenching his illiberal
principles into the nation's constitution. At the very least, Biden
should insist that Hungary be suspended from NATO until it can credibly
reestablish that it has dramatically changed course and is on the way to
rebuilding its "free institutions." There is every reason to believe
that the leadership in Brussels and Paris would respond to this American
initiative with enthusiasm. Indeed, von der Leyen is already leading the
commission down a rarely invoked path that would strip Hungary of the
billion-dollar EU subsidies its government receives --- which Orbán now
uses as a slush fund to sustain his dictatorial ambitions. The
commission is also seriously considering similar steps against Poland in
response to its continuing defiance of decisions by the European Court
of Justice, which has declared that the current government is violating
fundamental principles of constitutional democracy to which the European
Union is committed. If von der Leyen gains the necessary support to
suspend Poland's voting privileges in parliament until it complies with
the court's demands, Biden should support its suspension from the
Alliance as well. [The challenges ahead are extraordinary]{.underline}.
[But the reconstruction of NATO]{.underline} not only r[epresents the
West's best chance to prevent future Russian aggression]{.underline}. It
[also offers]{.underline} an [opportunity for the United States and
Europe to revitalize]{.underline} the great Enlightenment tradition of
[liberal democracy]{.underline} against the nationalist demagogues
seeking to destroy it on both sides of the Atlantic.

#### NATO strong now.

Giulia **Carbonaro** \[US News Reporter, Newsweek, "NATO to Massively
Expand Army in Bid to Deter Further Putin Aggression,"
https://www.newsweek.com/nato-massively-expand-army-bid-deter-further-putin-aggression-ukraine-defense-1718435//ZW\]

[NATO is preparing to expand its army]{.underline} in response to
Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, according to Sky News Security and
Defence Editor Deborah Haynes. The military [alliance has been forced to
rethink the way it can deter the aggressive ambitions of]{.underline}
Russian President Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} in Europe, she reported.
Moscow\'s assault on Ukraine, which isn\'t a NATO member, has added
urgency to the organization\'s long-standing but stalled defense plans.
\"Overnight the mentality changed,\" an unnamed NATO officer told
Haynes. \"[NATO now feels like it is electrified]{.underline}. You can
feel the energy surging through the system.\" Separately, a diplomat
told the Sky News editor that \"a [radical change in
posture]{.underline}\" [is expected to emerge from the NATO]{.underline}
summit in Spain between June 28 and 30. Officials at the gathering will
discuss how NATO\'s 40,000-strong Response Force (NRF) will be rebranded
and made up to six times larger, according to Haynes. [The overhaul, the
biggest in NATO since the Cold War]{.underline}, would rename the NRF
the Allied Reaction Force (AFR), according to the Sky News editor. Her
source at NATO said the final increase in numbers will probably be lower
than that. New Package for Ukraine Another possible change to be
implemented will be an increase in the size of the NATO mission in the
alliance\'s eastern and southeastern flank, with thousands more troops
expected to be based in their home nations and only being deployed if
needed. [NATO could]{.underline} also [decide to designate Russia as the
\"most significant and direct threat]{.underline}\" to security, wrote
Haynes, and to approve a new \"comprehensive assistance package\" for
Ukraine. In a statement delivered on April 6 ahead of the meeting of
NATO\'s ministers of foreign affairs, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
talked of the war in Ukraine as having \"long term implications\" for
NATO security, \"because we have seen the brutality,\" he said. \"We
have seen the willingness by President Putin to use military force to
reach his objectives. And that has changed the security reality in
Europe for many, many years. So therefore, we have started the process
in NATO, we have tasked our military commanders to provide options for
the political leaders to take decisions on how to reset our deterrence
and defence for the long term. This will of course, build on what we
have already done,\" Stoltenberg said then. [NATO has already reinforced
its collective defense in response to Russia\'s aggressive campaigns
against its neighbor]{.underline}, when it tripled the size of the NRF
in 2014 following Putin\'s annexation of Crimea. \"So we, NATO, \[were\]
actually quite well prepared when Russia invaded Ukraine for the second
time, and on the day of the invasion, we activated our defence plans,
deployed 1000s of additional troops in the eastern part of the Alliance.
Now there are 40,000 troops on the NATO command in the eastern part of
the Alliance. And there are more U.S. troops in Europe, 100,000 in
total, and other Allies have also increased their presence,\"
Stoltenberg said. \"We were well prepared when they invaded Ukraine. But
now [we need to take a new step, for a more long term strengthening of
our deterrence and defence]{.underline},\" the secretary general said in
April, adding that \"[decisions for the longer term will be made at the
summit in Madrid in June when the heads of state and government
meet]{.underline}.\" The meeting in Madrid next week will also be marked
by disappointment surrounding the obstacles now faced by Sweden and
Finland in their bid to join NATO. Both the alliance and the two Nordic
countries expected the membership process to be swift and smooth, but
were caught by surprise by Turkey\'s strong opposition to their
candidacy ---especially Sweden\'s. Ankara has accused Stockholm of
sheltering terrorists from the Kurdistan Workers\' Party (PKK).

[The security and prosperity of the transatlantic community, including
the United States, rests on the foundation of]{.underline} the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization ([NATO]{.underline}). Russia's ongoing war
of naked aggression against Ukraine, a NATO non-member state, should put
to rest any lingering questions about the modern utility of the Alliance
and about which threat should be the focus of NATO's upcoming strategic
concept. The answer is clear: [The U.S. must lead the Alliance to a
wholesale refocusing on the organization's raison d'être of collective
defense]{.underline}. While the Alliance faces challenges emanating from
an unstable Mediterranean basin and terrorism originating from the
Middle East, the fact remains that [Russia continues to be the only
existential threat to member states]{.underline}. [NATO must send a
strong signal that it is strengthening deterrence measures]{.underline}
explicitly in response to the increased threat from Russia. Deterrence
measures should include an Alliance-wide recommitment to defense
spending; a persistent and continuing U.S. presence in Eastern European
member states; updated Alliance operational planning in light of
Russia's position in Belarus and Ukraine; and an increase in U.S. air,
ground, and naval forces in the European theater as a sign of continued
commitment to the NATO treaty's Article 5. These deterrence measures
must be carried out with the recognition that, from a long-term
perspective, China is the largest peer challenger from whom the U.S.
must expect hostile action. Any improvements to the U.S. force posture
must not be to the detriment of the nation's ability to counter China.
[The Importance of NATO Deterrence Has Only Increased]{.underline} From
the Arctic to the Levant, [Russia remains an aggressive and capable
threat to NATO]{.underline} and the interests of its members. For member
states in Eastern Europe, [Russia represents a real and potentially
existential threat]{.underline}. Russia's entrenched position in
Belarus, along with its ongoing actions to cleave Ukraine, a nation that
borders four NATO members, in two, scramble the geostrategic map of
Europe and necessitate changes to NATO operational planning,
exemplifying the need for the Alliance to take swift and resolute steps
to bolster deterrence measures along its eastern flank. Russia's ongoing
war against Ukraine will hopefully be the push that some allies need to
finally live up to their commitments to the NATO defense spending
benchmark. As an intergovernmental security alliance, [NATO is only as
strong as its member states]{.underline}. Weak defense spending on the
continent has led to a significant loss of capabilities and embarrassing
gaps in readiness for NATO allies. As a result, [American Presidents of
both political parties have long called for increases in defense
spending by NATO allies]{.underline}. Although most are familiar with
Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty---an attack on one is an attack
on all---Article 3 is the most important when it comes to the overall
health of the Alliance. Article 3 states that member states, at a
minimum, will "maintain and develop their individual and collective
capacity to resist armed attack." Only a handful of NATO members can
legitimately say that they are living up to their Article 3 commitment.
In 2006, in an effort to encourage defense investment, NATO set a target
for its 30 member states to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) on defense. At the 2014 Wales Summit, member states recommitted to
spending 2 percent of GDP on defense and committed to spending 20
percent of their defense budgets on "major equipment" purchases by 2024.
NATO allies have made real and sustained increases in defense spending
in recent years, but it is far from enough. In 2021, 10 members of the
Alliance spent 2 percent of GDP on defense, and 24 members met the 20
percent benchmark.**^1^** Procuring capabilities does not happen
overnight, and allies in NATO must commit today to investing the
necessary political and economic capital to fulfill their Article 3
treaty commitments. **U.S. Deployments in Europe Can Magnify NATO
Deterrence** U.S. basing structures in Europe harken back to a time when
Denmark, West Germany, and Greece represented the front lines of
freedom. [The security situation in Europe has changed,]{.underline} not
least of which due to Russia's force posture in Belarus and occupied
portions of Ukraine. [The U.S. must account for this shift by
establishing a persistent and continuing military presence]{.underline}
in allied nations further east. A robust presence displays the long-term
U.S. resolve to live up to its NATO treaty commitments. The U.S. should
lead by example, while also encouraging other NATO allies to base forces
in Eastern European member states. Over the course of the past few
weeks, the U.S. has deployed additional rotational forces in Europe. On
Thursday, 7,000 troops from the Army's First Brigade, Third Infantry
Division, deployed to bases in Germany.^**2**^ In total, the U.S. has
deployed an additional 14,000 troops to Europe in response to Russia's
actions in Ukraine. The U.S. has also redeployed aircraft further east
on a temporary basis, including 20 Apache helicopters (AH-64s) based in
Germany deploying to Baltic allies, 12 AH-64s based in Greece deploying
to Poland,**^3^** and six F-35 fighter jets from Utah deploying
temporarily to bases in Estonia, Lithuania, and Romania.**^4^**
Furthermore, two B-52s from the 5th Bomb Wing deployed on a
"long-planned Bomber Task Force Europe mission over the Arctic and
Baltic Sea regions."**^5^** Earlier in February, the U.S. deployed 3,000
forces to Poland and Romania to bolster deterrence and aid in
preparations for refugees crossing the border from Ukraine. The U.S.
Department of Defense noted that "\[t\]hese moves are temporary in
nature, and are part of the more than 90,000 U.S. troops already in
Europe on rotational and permanent orders." Some NATO allies have also
increased their presence further east. Germany, which serves as the
framework nation in Lithuania for NATO's enhanced forward presence
battalion stationed there, added 350 troops.**^6^** NATO allies have
battlegroups stationed in Estonia (U.K.-led), Latvia (Canadian-led), and
Poland (U.S.-led); France has offered to lead a similar battalion in
Romania, and stated that it is "accelerating" the deployment of forces
to the nation.**^7^** On Friday, NATO activated its Very High Readiness
Joint Taskforce (VJTF), with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stating:
"We are now deploying the NATO response force for the first time in the
context of collective defense."**^8^** NATO will partially deploy a
portion of the VJTF to Eastern Europe; the deployment will include air,
land, and naval assets.**^9^** **No Time to Lose** R[ussia's full-scale
invasion of Ukraine highlights the stark reality that the threat from
Russia to NATO is real and enduring]{.underline}. [The U.S. and its
allies must take immediate steps]{.underline} to bolster collective
defense and deter Vladimir Putin from aggression against a NATO member
state. In light of the emerging new security reality on the continent,
the U.S. should: **Reaffirm the importance of Article 3.** Article 3 of
the North Atlantic Treaty is the most important when it comes to the
overall health of the Alliance. Article 3 states that member states, at
a minimum, will "maintain and develop their individual and collective
capacity to resist armed attack." Only a handful of NATO members can say
that they are living up to their Article 3 commitment. This is a case
where "naming and shaming" should play a role. The U.S. should focus on
those nations that do not have a plan to increase defense spending.
**Encourage NATO members to make increased defense spending the law of
the land.** Some allies have passed legislation requiring that a certain
amount of GDP be spent on international aid, while failing to do the
same for defense spending. The U.S. should encourage NATO members to
enshrine defense spending commitments and timelines in legislation. This
would help to increase transparency and political accountability. **Call
a special meeting to renew focus on defense spending.** NATO should call
a special session to discuss the need for immediate commitment of allies
to meeting NATO defense spending benchmarks. This session should include
as many finance ministers as possible. In many parliamentary
democracies, it is the finance minister who controls public spending.
Educating the finance ministers on the importance of military investment
might help to secure more defense spending over the long term. Germany's
recent announcement that it would finally work to meet its 2 percent
spending commitment shows that the time is ripe for such a push.
**Encourage allies to make a public case for defense spending.** An
average of 71 percent of the publics across NATO believes that their
country should defend another NATO ally if attacked. To honor this
commitment, however, a nation must have the appropriate capabilities and
manpower. Leaders in Canada and Europe should not take public support
for NATO membership for granted. Instead, the strategic review should
encourage governments to strongly and consistently make the case for
NATO, and for the importance of robust defense spending, to their
publics. **Establish a persistent and continuing presence in Eastern
European member states.** Persistent and continuing deployments could
include a U.S. Army heavy division in Poland (not just the headquarters,
but a division with three full brigade combat teams) with supporting air
defense and long-range fires or stationing a U.S. Air Force Wing in
Europe. It is important to note that while new rotational forces in
Europe certainly improve deterrence, they are an unequal substitute for
permanently stationed forces. Living, operating, and training where the
fighting will occur is an advantage that both U.S. allies and
adversaries enjoy. Permanently stationed forces have better
person-to-person contacts with allies, as well as improved doctrinal,
technical, and cultural interoperability. **Increase the U.S. Naval
presence near Russia.** U.S. military planners should not underestimate
the importance of a robust naval component for deterrence. The U.S.
should ensure a continued robust Naval presence in key regions, such as
the North Atlantic, the eastern Mediterranean, and the northern Pacific,
as a means of additional deterrence against Russia. Given Russia's
recent invasion of Ukraine, near-term consideration should be given for
increased naval presence in the Baltic Sea to signal commitment to
Baltic State NATO members, as well as to allies Finland and Sweden, who
have come under renewed threat from Russia regarding potential future
accession to NATO. **Develop the nuclear sea-launched cruise missile
(SLCM-N) to bolster U.S. non-strategic nuclear capabilities.** Russia
deploys thousands of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe meant for use on
the battlefield; meanwhile, U.S. nuclear forces in this category are
very limited. Fielding the SLCM-N, as proposed by the Trump
Administration in 2018, would help to fill this gap in U.S. nuclear
deterrence should conventional conflict in Europe escalate. Conversely,
canceling the SLCM-N after the program has already been initiated would
only signal further weakness to Russia and NATO at a time when nuclear
threats are growing.**^10^** **Encourage allies to increase their

aggression]{.underline}. **A Critical Time for Deterrence** [Russia's

https://thehill.com/opinion/international/593627-putin-doesnt-fear-nato-or-ukraine-he-fears-democracy///ZW\]

As the world waits to learn if Putin will order a full-scale military
offensive in Ukraine, Washington seems to be stumbling over a simple
question: H[ow much does Russian aggression in Europe matter to U.S.
interests?]{.underline} One view is that Ukraine's status is more
important to Russia than to us, especially because Ukraine is not a part
of NATO. Others go further, questioning whether even NATO members,
guaranteed protection by Article 5, are worth defending. Media have
noted [Tucker Carlson]{.underline}'s growing influence in Republican
circles on this question. Two years ago, he previewed his stance when I
debated him on his show. He [argued that NATO members Estonia and
Latvia, are, like Ukraine, not worth defending if invaded by
Russia]{.underline}. I [countered]{.underline}, as I explain in more
detail here, [that it's in America's vital interest to support these
sovereign nations]{.underline} --- precisely [because Putin is targeting
them for their decision to turn away from the governance model on offer
from Russia]{.underline}. To understand why Putin's threat to invade
Ukraine --- or any other independent state in Europe --- matters,
consider why he might do it. [Putin wants you to believe it's because
NATO expansion to Ukraine threatens the Russian people and Russia's
security]{.underline}. [He doesn't genuinely believe this]{.underline}.
It's propaganda. [NATO is a defensive alliance]{.underline}. [No member
of NATO]{.underline}, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, [has conveyed a
credible threat to peoples or places inside Russia's current
borders]{.underline}. In fact, [NATO sought a constructive relationship
with Russia]{.underline} after the dissolution of the U.S.S.R., until
Putin steered the country onto its present course. [Putin is a careful
study and knows that NATO isn't interested in gobbling up Russian
territory]{.underline} or subjugating Russian people. Similarly, a
sovereign and independent Ukraine presents no actual threat to Russian
lands. [Putin fears an independent Ukraine with strong ties to the
West]{.underline} for the same reason he sent troops to Kazakhstan last
month to put down peaceful protests, poisoned and imprisoned Alexei
Navalny, his political opponent in Russia, and directed Russian spy
services to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. There's
one common thread running through each of these endeavors --- and nearly
every other foreign policy initiative now championed by Putin: [He wants
to undermine democracy]{.underline}, wherever it is, or can take root,
[especially in countries on Russia's border that he's worried he can't
control]{.underline}. Why does he fear democracy so much? Sure, Putin is
a Cold War enthusiast, but his main priority is not to restore the
eminence of old U.S.S.R. in Eastern Europe. It's [to boost his own
prospect for self-preservation]{.underline}. To Putin, [this means
consolidating all political powers in Russia inside his
office]{.underline} and [carefully guarding against the appeal of
democratic challengers to his "forever presidency]{.underline}." Last
year, [Putin amended the Russian constitution so he can remain President
until at least 2036]{.underline}. This will make him Kremlin's longest
serving leader since Peter the Great, even longer than Stalin. [NATO has
never posed a real threat to Putin's supremacy inside
Russia]{.underline}. [But a well-functioning democracy on Russia's
border, which could inspire new democratic movements within Russia,
would]{.underline}. And [this threat could be especially dangerous for
Putin if it re-focused Russians inward]{.underline}, at their own
lamentable economy, [instead of on Putin's outward bluster that NATO is
the greatest threat to their well-being]{.underline}. Because the true
source of Putin's ire is the adoption of more democratic institutions by
sovereign states in Russia's neighborhood, Putin is actually challenging
not a particular nation or alliance, but the spread of democracy and
rule of law[. When the sovereignty of nations striving for more stable
democracies is threatened, U.S. commitment to democracy in general is at
stake]{.underline}. The U.S. cheered Ukraine during three defining
events in its democracy: first, when it held a referendum in 1991 and 90
percent of its population voted in favor of independence; second, during
the "Orange Revolution" in the winter of 2004, when people took to the
streets of Kyiv to protest an election clearly rigged to benefit the
Kremlin-backed candidate (the pro-Western candidate survived an
attempted assassination by poison), and third, when a groundswell of
democratic protests in 2013 forced former President Viktor Yanukovych
from power after his decision to back out of a popular trade agreement
with the EU in fealty to Moscow. All three were clear rejections of
Russia, in favor of democracy. [What Russia is posing to do
now]{.underline}, after 30 years of Ukrainian independence, [is a clear
violation of international law]{.underline}. The lack of a response
could usher the collapse of a rules-based order which the U.S. has
nurtured since the end of WWII. The U.N. is already absent on the issue
of Ukraine's sovereignty because of Russia's veto. In 1990, when Iraq
invaded Kuwait without any legal basis for doing so, the U.S. organized
a coalition and mobilized in Kuwait's defense, with U.N. authorization.
This sent a message to aggressors around the world that if they invade
their neighbors, they could be destroyed. If Putin successfully invades
Ukraine without serious consequences, it would send the opposite message
--- and might lead Putin to believe he can do it again, including to one
of those NATO democracies in Eastern Europe that Tucker Carlson believes
aren't worth defending. It would also signal to other nationalist
regimes with extraterritorial aspirations --- including China, Iran, and
Turkey --- that they too could orchestrate cross-border offensives to
stamp out democratic tendencies in their region without repercussion.

### AT: Entrapment

#### No NATO entrapment.

**Lanoszka 17** \-- Alexander Lanoszka, International Relations
Professor at the University of Waterloo. \[Tangled up in rose? Theories
of alliance entrapment and the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, Contemporary
Security Policy, 39(2), December 2017, Taylor & Francis\]

[Critics charge]{.underline} that [NATO has been reckless]{.underline}
in its outreach to countries like Georgia and Ukraine. In so doing, it
has encouraged those countries to behave more aggressive towards Russia,
[risking war]{.underline} in such a way that implicates NATO members
against their own interests. The [dangers of entrapment
abound]{.underline}.

This article analyzes the different causal pathways and variables that
scholars have invoked to describe how entrapment risks arise. According
to the international relations literature, four broad sources of risk
exist. The strength of the commitment given to the ally---actual or
potential---is an institutional source. The greater the commitment, the
more perverse incentives it creates for the ally to behave recklessly.
System polarity and the offense-defense balance are systemic factors
insofar as no one country can manipulate them. Multipolarity raises the
value of allies for maintaining the balance of power, whereas the
offense-defense balance affects how a defender might manage its ties
with its ally. Reputational sources of risk arise when an ally exploits
the defender's interest to defend its commitments for intrinsic reasons.
Finally, entrapment risks can have ideological sources: An ally
strategically appeals to the ideological prejudices of its defender,
thereby reshaping the defender's own sense of strategic interests on
favorable terms. Some of these arguments regarding how entrapment
unfolds have already been subject to criticism on empirical and logical
grounds. Besides organizing these arguments typologically, I demonstrate
how uncovering clear evidence of entrapment is a difficult enterprise,
even when the theories themselves seem straightforward.

The main problem concerns counterfactuals. The [[factors that]{.mark}
**allegedly [generate]{.mark}** [entrapment]{.mark} risks can be [**so
wide-ranging** that]{.mark} imagining [a world]{.mark} in which they
operate differently [would require changing other variables]{.mark},
which]{.underline} in turn can [make war more or less
likely]{.underline}. Alternatively, [[they might not exclude]{.mark}
**other [factors]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} could [lead to]{.mark} **the
same [violent outcome]{.mark}**]{.underline}. After all, [[conflict
drives]{.mark} both [alliance formation **and**]{.mark} the likelihood
of war. [States join]{.mark} alliances because they assess that the
possibility of war is non-trivial]{.underline}. Similarly, [a defender
might be receptive to the overtures of an ally **precisely
[because]{.mark}** [it has]{.mark} **a pre-existing [desire]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} see [[conflict with]{.mark} the
[adversary]{.mark} of that ally. In social scientific parlance,
**[endogeneity]{.mark} problems** [are **pervasive**]{.mark} when trying
[to]{.mark} understand]{.underline} whether
**[[entrapment]{.underline}]{.mark}** has occurred or is at risk of
occurring. The case of the 2008 Russo-Georgian War is instructive by
revealing these ambiguities. Many NATO members---especially those in
Western Europe---were lukewarm towards Georgia's bid to become a treaty
ally, arguably because they recognized that Georgia posed certain
entrapment risks. The United States was the most supportive of Georgia,
but it might have overstated its support to Georgia in order to gain a
bargaining chip with Russia. It might have even done so because Western
European countries were so hesitant, thereby ignoring Saakashvili's
non-democratic tendencies. But by this very token, the United States
limited its response to the outbreak of hostilities between Georgia and
Russia in August 2008. [**The [Georgia]{.mark}n case**
[suggests]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[states do not forge alliances
**mindlessly** nor]{.mark} do they **[follow]{.mark} their
[allies]{.mark} off the cliff [thoughtlessly]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One
cannot by definition want to be entrapped.

[The]{.underline} Russo-[Georgian War]{.underline} of 2008 [illustrates
the need to **disentangle** the factors that push states to fight
wars]{.underline} and to seek alliances while carefully investigating
the mechanisms through which alliances fuel wars. As noted, some
baseline probability of war had already existed between the two former
Soviet republics when Saakashvili became President. Their conflict
centered on an unresolved dispute regarding the political status of
Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Neither could commit to a durable
settlement. Moreover, territorial concessions and submission to salami
tactics could have signaled Georgian weakness, thereby encouraging new
or more assertive territorial demands. Georgian leaders might have also
faced domestic incentives to stand firm towards Russia---incentives that
would have existed independent of NATO. To the extent that alliance
politics mattered from Georgia's perspective, Saakashvili might have
cherry-picked information that confirmed his beliefs regarding Western
support. Nevertheless, these factors are idiosyncratic because they stem
directly from his personality. In a counterfactual world where NATO was
not a factor, he could have had these and other cognitive biases that
would have elevated the likelihood of war.

By undertaking this sort of counterfactual analysis,
[[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[must]{.underline}]{.mark} take
care to [**[isolate]{.mark}** the [effect]{.mark} of an alliance
commitment---to the degree that it exists---[from]{.mark} **the
[underlying propensity]{.mark} of war**]{.underline}. Georgia bears a
methodological and analytical lesson for thinking about entrapment:
[**Just [because]{.mark}** [NATO was an issue]{.mark} for Georgian
security in 2008 **[does not mean]{.mark}** the [alliance was]{.mark}
**causally [responsible]{.mark}** for the war]{.underline}. Future
[[research]{.underline}]{.mark} on alliances and war [[must
not]{.underline}]{.mark} only [[identify
**correlations**]{.underline}]{.mark} between alliances and conflict,
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} also sort out various causal mechanisms that
connect [**different [causal factors]{.mark}** with war]{.underline}.

Carefully disentangling the factors that could lead to entrapment
matters not only for theory and methodology but also for policy. If
entrapment concerns are real, then defense planners must have a clear
idea as to where they come from. Some entrapment risks can be attenuated
with active policy measures. [[Conditioning]{.mark} **a political or
military [commitment]{.mark}**]{.underline} when dealing with a
risk-acceptant ally is one example. But doing so [[might not matter if
we]{.mark} have reason to [think]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[**[system]{.mark}ic forces** [make that ally]{.mark} **more
[aggressive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Strong commitments could even make
seemingly jumpy allies more secure. And so, armed with a better
understanding of what drives entrapment risks, defense planners would be
more confident in modulating political and military commitments
appropriately. As such, [[critics of NATO]{.mark} expansion]{.underline}
and American foreign policy [[may be **overstating**]{.mark} their
case]{.underline}. NATO might bear some indirect responsibility for the
Russo-Georgian War, but its culpability lessens when we consider the
other factors that increased the likelihood of war: misperceptions,
overconfidence, and the commitment problems underlying the territorial
disputes themselves. If anything, the key policy challenge is for NATO
to determine whether prospective partners like Saakashvili have
psychological traits or cognitive biases that would make them
unjustifiably optimistic about the level of support that they would
receive.

### AT: Commitment Trap

#### The alliance solves by [moderating]{.underline} both parties.

Science at the University of Kentucky, Political Science PhD from Rice

Military Alliances, International Organization, 68(4), JSTOR\]

Interstate wars cost more than thirty million lives during the twentieth
century, and nine new interstate wars have begun since the end of the
Cold War.1 Finding ways to avoid interstate disputes and to manage those
that arise short of war, therefore, is a major priority for
policy-makers and for scholars of international relations. It is well
recognized that military alliances play a role in conflict prevention by
deterring attacks on their members, but less attention has been paid to
the role of allies in conflict management. We argue that
[[allies]{.mark}, as coercive actors with a stake in the dispute,
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} sometimes [**especially [well
positioned]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} help [[resolve
**disputes**]{.mark} **short of war**]{.underline}.

We examine the influence of allies to a target state on crisis
bargaining. Not only do [[allies]{.underline}]{.mark} have an interest
in the outcome of crisis bargaining but they also may [have the ability
to [make]{.mark} **credible [threats]{.mark}** to both the challenger
and the target [that influence]{.mark} **the [bargaining]{.mark}
stances** [of **both disputants**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A target\'s ally
can make it clear to the challenger that if the challenger demands too
much, the ally will intervene in the war on behalf of the target. But a
target\'s ally may also be able to make a credible threat to the
target - that if the target refuses to concede to a demand that the ally
finds reason- able, the ally will not intervene in the war on the
target\'s behalf. [The [ally may]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore [have
**a moderating [effect]{.mark}**]{.underline} not only on the
challenger\'s demand, but also [on **[the target]{.mark}\'s response**,
[making]{.mark} **peaceful [settlement]{.mark} more
[likely]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We refer to the former as the deter-
rence effect of alliances, and the latter as **[the restraining effect
of alliances]{.underline}**.

To study this process, [[we develop **a three-player**]{.mark}
**game-theoretic [model]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Most recent
game-theoretic models of crisis bargaining assume that a challenger and
a target bargain without influence from any outside states.2 Yet, allies
who would be obligated to intervene in a war that develops between a
challenger and target will often cast a shadow over crisis negotiations.
[[Dyadic]{.mark} bargaining [models]{.mark}]{.underline} that assume a
challenger and a target bargain without influence from any outside
states [[are **inadequate**]{.underline}]{.mark} for our understanding
of conflict dynamics in such situations.

We derive a number of propositions about the relationships between such
factors as the costs of war, the value of the stakes, and the value of
an alliance and specific out- comes. The demands challengers make, the
conditions under which targets concede demands without fighting, and the
conditions under which targets resist demands militarily are all
influenced by the presence of an ally. Given the richness of our formal
results, we make no attempt to test all of the implications of the
model. We do, however, discuss a few stylized cases that highlight
different outcomes, and [[we provide **a large-N**]{.mark} **empirical
[test]{.mark}**]{.underline} of one proposition drawn from the model. We
find support for the claim that [when a target depends **heavily** on
**an alliance for security**, that target is **less likely**
to]{.underline} resist a **[challenge militarily]{.underline}**.

Our research suggests that military alliances have an influence in
international politics well beyond collaborative war fighting and
deterrence. [[Alliances deter conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}, which in
itself is a force for peace, [[but]{.mark} **even [when]{.mark}**
[challengers are **not**]{.mark} **deterred**]{.underline} from making
demands, [[allies]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[facilitate]{.mark}
**peaceful [settlement]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Alliances can be
important institutions for conflict management, not only among their
members, but between their members and outside states as well. As such,
[alliances can be **broad institutions for peace**]{.underline} that
play an important role in maintaining the stability of the international
system.3

//GrRv)

In his article "Why America's Grand Strategy Has Not Changed: Power,
Habit, and the U.S. Foreign Policy Establishment," Patrick [[Porter
argues]{.mark} that the continuity of [U.S.]{.mark} grand
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} since World War II [has [resulted from a
**group-think mentality**]{.mark}]{.underline} fostered by a powerful
foreign policy elite---"the Blob"---[[that **stifles debate**]{.mark}
and prevents]{.underline} needed **[course corrections]{.underline}**.1
[[Porter]{.mark}'s]{.underline} provocative [argument
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} ultimately [**[unpersuasive]{.mark}**, because
[it **overstates** the degree of **conformity**]{.mark} **and
consensus** [in U.S. strategy]{.mark} while slighting the **most obvious
explanations** for the strategy's **endurance**]{.underline}. Below we
highlight several problems with his argument.

First, [Porter **exaggerates** the degree of consensus in U.S. foreign
policy]{.underline} since World War II. In fact, despite a bipartisan
consensus on the necessity of U.S. global leadership in support of a
congenial international order (what Porter calls "primacy"), intense
debates about how that strategy should be operationalized have been
common in U.S. foreign policy circles.
[[Policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark}, elected officials, and policy
commentators [[**argued heatedly** over]{.mark} such fundamental issues
as whether to pursue a **Europe-first** or **Asia-first
strategy**]{.underline} in the 1950s, whether and how aggressively to
combat Soviet and communist influence in the developing world, whether
to make or avoid defense commitments on the Asian mainland, whether to
pursue détente or confrontation with the Soviet Union in the 1970s,
whether to use force to reverse Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in
1990--91, [whether to **expand** the **[N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}tlantic
[T]{.mark}reaty [O]{.mark}rganization**]{.underline} after the Cold War,
[[and whether to]{.underline} **[invade Iraq]{.underline}**]{.mark} in
2003. [[These]{.mark} debates [reflected **genuine intellectual
disagreements**]{.mark}]{.underline} that pitted members of the Blob
against one another. Porter would likely respond that such debates were
essentially about tactics, but [the fact that [the]{.mark} foreign
policy [community]{.mark} has engaged in knock-down, drag-out debates
over issues of such enormous strategic importance shows that it [is
**not**]{.mark}]{.underline} as **[[unified]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and
the marketplace of ideas not as limited, as Porter claims.

Second, [although Porter argues]{.underline} that **[dissenting foreign
policy]{.underline}** **[views]{.underline}** advocating an approach he
calls "restraint" [tend to be **marginalized**, departures from a
**strategy of U.S. leadership** have **time and again** received a
hearing]{.underline} at the highest levels of government. In the 1950s
and 1960s, Presidents Dwight [[**Eisenhower** and]{.mark}]{.underline}
John **[[Kennedy]{.underline}]{.mark}** repeatedly [[considered
**withdrawing**]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. [**troops** from
Europe]{.underline}.2 Similar debates occurred in Congress in the late
1960s and early 1970s. When Jimmy **[Carter]{.underline}** took office,
he [**strongly favored** withdrawing U.S. troops from **South
Korea**]{.underline}.3 In the early 1990s, the George H.W. [**Bush**
and]{.underline} Bill **[Clinton]{.underline}** administrations
initially [delegated]{.underline} management of the crisis in the former
[**Yugoslavia** to]{.underline} the [Europe]{.underline}an NATO allies.
In 2011, Barack [**Obama** **withdrew U.S. troops from
Iraq**]{.underline} as part of a broader move toward an offshore
balancing strategy in the Middle East.4 In other words, presidents and
other [**[political leaders]{.mark}** in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [[have]{.mark} often been willing to [consider
**significant changes** in]{.mark} U.S. [strategy, and]{.mark} they have
sometimes even [implemented policies that]{.mark} represented a
**meaningful [shift toward retrenchment]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
restraint.

Third, [the reason that many of [these]{.mark} departures [were
**not**]{.mark}]{.underline} ultimately
**[[undertaken]{.underline}]{.mark}**---or proved fleeting---[is **not**
because policymakers denied them a **fair, open hearing**]{.underline}.
[It is [because they were]{.mark}]{.underline} judged---or later
shown---to be [**substantively [inferior]{.mark}** [to more assertive
policies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Eisenhower **never
withdrew**]{.underline} U.S. troops [from **Europe**]{.underline},
[because he understood that doing so would have threatened to
**destabilize**]{.underline} the interlocking series of arrangements
that deterred the Soviet Union while pacifying Germany and **[Western
Europe]{.underline}**.5 [Carter never withdrew]{.underline} U.S. troops
[from South Korea, for fear that **doing so** would have risked
incentivizing **South Korean nuclear proliferation**]{.underline} and
destabilizing the fragile balance in a critical part of the world.6 The
United States ultimately took the lead in addressing the crackup of
Yugoslavia when the inability of the Europeans to deal with the crisis
had become clear. [Obama did draw down U.S. forces in Iraq, but large
swaths of that country]{.underline} (and Syria) [were subsequently
**overrun** by]{.underline} the \[**[ISIL]{.underline}**\] Islamic
State, compelling a reassertion of U.S. military and diplomatic
engagement.7 In these and other cases, an emphasis on [**U.S. leadership
has persisted**, because that approach has been deemed---after
**significant debate**]{.underline} or hard experience---[**superior**
to the alternatives.]{.underline}

Fourth, and related, [Porter slights the **simplest explanation** for
why there has been substantial consistency in U.S. strategy: **because
it works.**]{.underline} As scholars have demonstrated, [the past
**seventy years** have been **among the best** in human history in terms
of **rising**]{.underline} global and U.S. [**prosperity**, the spread
of]{.underline} democracy and human **[rights]{.underline}**, [the
**avoidance** of **great power war**, and the **decline of war in
general**.]{.underline}8 It has also been a period when the world's
leading power consistently pursued a grand strategy geared explicitly
toward achieving those goals[. To prove that U.S. grand strategy
persists for reasons **other than utility**, Porter would have to show
that U.S. leadership has **not been necessary to those
outcomes**]{.underline} or that it is no longer necessary. **[But he
does not do so]{.underline}** ([or even really **try** to do
so]{.underline}), [and his article **does not engage** the relevant
social science **scholarship** and historical literature establishing a
**causal connection** between **U.S. engagements** and **key aspects**
of the relatively benign global order]{.underline}.9

Finally, **[[critics of primacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** consistently
[[argue]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Porter does, [that [their ideas
are]{.mark}]{.underline} censored or [[**excluded** from **policy
debates**. Yet, **critics**]{.mark} of U.S. grand strategy [are
**prominent**]{.mark} **within the academy**]{.underline}, including at
prestigious institutions such as the University of Chicago, Harvard, and
the Massachusetts Institute of [Technology. Their **op-eds** and
**essays** appear in the New York Times]{.underline}, Foreign Policy,
and Foreign Affairs, [among other]{.underline} prominent
"[mainstream]{.underline}" [outlets, and **their work** receives
**generous funding**]{.underline}. Leading [**critics of primacy** are
regular participants in]{.underline} U.S. **[government--sponsored
outreach initiatives]{.underline}** such as the National Intelligence
Council's Intelligence Associates program. Not least, although Porter
and many other realists in the academy deplore key aspects of the
current president's foreign policy, that president's own core critique
of the foreign policy elite echoes those made by academic realists.10 If
this is censorship, it is a remarkably ineffective form of censorship.
Perhaps [[the reason primacy endures is **not that the marketplace of
ideas is broken**, but that it is **working**]{.mark} **fairly
well.**]{.underline}

#### NATO withdrawal whets Putin's appetite to dominate the Black Sea

Fourth, **[[the Alliance must]{.underline}]{.mark}** more substantially
embrace and **[[support the membership]{.underline}]{.mark}**
aspirations **[[of Ukraine and Georgia]{.underline}]{.mark}**. NATO
**[[enlargement]{.underline}]{.mark}** has been one of the great success
stories of post-Cold War Europe. The extension of NATO membership to
Central European democracies **[[reinforced peace and security in
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}** and strengthened the Alliance's military 4
capability. [The newest members of the Alliance have been among Europe's
most stalwart transatlanticists and most willing to contribute to US-led
operations, including those beyond Europe.]{.underline}

The recent accession of Montenegro and the impending accession of
Macedonia to NATO are important steps toward completing the vision of an
undivided Europe, but **[[the Alliance needs to also provide Ukraine and
Georgia a clear path to NATO membership]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
recognizing it will take them time to meet the political and military
requirements.

Toward this end, these **[[two nations should be]{.mark}]{.underline}**
more **[[deeply incorporated into]{.mark} the maritime, air, and ground
force initiatives the United States and [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** is
developing for the **[Black Sea region.]{.underline}**
[[Their]{.underline}]{.mark} territories would be **[[useful to
anti-sub]{.underline}]{.mark}**marine, air-defense, surveillance, and
other **[[op]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration**[[s]{.mark} nee[ded to
counter Russia']{.mark}]{.underline}**s efforts to leverage its
occupation of Crimea into an anti-access/area-denial bastion spanning
that sea. And, NATO Allies should expand the lethal security assistance
provided to Georgia and Ukraine to include anti-aircraft systems,
antiship missiles and other capabilities that would enhance their
capacities for self-defense.

**[One]{.underline}** clear **[lesson from Moscow's invasions of Ukraine
and Georgia is that [the ambiguity of these two]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[countries' relationships with the Alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}**
only **[[whetted the appetite of]{.mark}]{.underline}** Russia's

his sense of opportunity [to reassert Moscow's heg]{.mark}emony
[over]{.mark}]{.underline}** what has been allowed to become
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}** de facto and **[[destabilizing grey
zone]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Europe's strategic landscape.

Next, **[[NATO's presence in the Baltics]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
Poland [[is]{.mark} the right size]{.underline}: [[large enough
to]{.mark} present a **credible [deter]{.mark}rent** to [Russia, but
**not**]{.mark} **large enough to [present an offensive]{.mark} military
[threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[[NATO was right to beef up]{.mark}
its [presence]{.mark} in the Baltics after 2014]{.underline}**. After
all, the three tiny Alliance members are simply incapable of defending
themselves alone in the unlikely event of war with Russia. But deploying
seven full brigades totaling 40,000 to 50,000 troops, as some analysts
suggest, would be destabilizing. Russia would doubtless perceive this
deployment as an offensive threat and increase its forces in response.
The four NATO battle groups currently deployed -- one each to the three
Baltic republics and Poland -- are important for their composition as
much as their size. These 5,000-plus troops could do no more than delay
a Russian incursion while NATO deployed reinforcements. But the fact
that 24 of the 30 NATO members contribute forces to the Alliance's
"Enhanced Forward Presence" mission makes it clear to Russia that NATO
is united in its determination to defend the Baltics, and that war there
means war with nearly all of NATO.

Lastly, [**[there is no indication]{.mark}** that [Moscow has **any
intention** of invading the Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Russia has
always seen the Baltics as different]{.underline} from the rest of the
former Soviet Union. In short, when the Kremlin looks at Estonia,
Latvia, and Lithuania [[it sees]{.mark} [Europe]{.mark}]{.underline},
[and it had always played by different rules in Europe than in its
self-designated "near abroad"]{.underline}. Anatol Lieven remarked on
this Russian tendency in his book The Baltic Revolution: "A large
proportion of Baltic Russians have been prepared to acknowledge that the
Balts have a superior civic culture, are cleaner, more orderly and
harder working. They may qualify this by saying that Russian life is
'friendlier', or 'more humane', but this is the exact reverse of the
usual colonizer: colonized self-images."

[[Russia]{.mark}'s behavior toward the Baltic States immediately after
the collapse of the Soviet Union made clear the extent to which it
treats them differently. As it was intervening on behalf of separatist
movements in Georgia and Moldova, it [scrupulously avoided
escalating]{.mark} the situation with the Russian-speaking minorities in
Latvia and Estonia]{.underline}. Despite the fact that Moscow was
exceptionally unhappy with the treatment of Russians speakers there, and
had military forces deployed to both countries until 1994, it always
expressed its grievances through official, institutional channels
instead of trying to rally the Russian-speaking minorities to violence
or intervening directly as it did elsewhere.

**[[Rather than]{.mark} fixate on [the Baltics]{.mark}, where the threat
is low and a deterrent force is in place]{.underline}**, **[[NATO should
pay]{.underline}]{.mark}** more [**[attention to the Black Sea]{.mark}**
region. **[It is here that Russia has already intervened]{.mark}
militarily, [and is attempting to fracture the Alliance and erode
confidence in its commitments]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [**[The Black
Sea]{.mark}** region also [serves as the hub for Russia's recent
expansion into]{.mark} the Eastern Mediterranean and is critical to its
efforts to support its intervention in [Syria]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There are four main reasons the Black Sea region demands more attention.

First, three of the six littoral states -- Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey
-- are NATO members and two -- [**[Ukraine and Georgia]{.underline}** --
**[were]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[promised membership]{.mark} in
2008]{.underline}**. [[Whether the Alliance should have
committed]{.mark} to membership for Ukraine and Georgia [is no longer
relevant; **it made the commitment and routinely reiterates it**]{.mark}
**at NATO summits**]{.underline}. **[[Every year that]{.mark} the fear
of Russia's reaction [delays]{.mark} progress on [bringing]{.mark} Kyiv
and Tbilisi [into NATO erodes confidence in NATO's other
commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Next, an examination of Russian military activities in the last
decade-plus leads to the conclusion that [the Black Sea and Eastern
Mediterranean is the area of greatest geopolitical importance for
Russia]{.underline}. [All of [its military interventions in]{.mark} this
period]{.underline} -- **[[Georgia, Ukraine and
Syria]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [have [occurred in this region]{.mark},
and **[Moscow]{.mark} clearly [intends to challenge the]{.mark} [West in
this part of the world. NATO provides the best vehicle to meet this
challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline} and protect the important national
interests Western states have in this region.

#### Black Sea conflict causes great power war

Conclusion

These three **[[conflict scenarios are plausible]{.mark} risks [for the
Black Sea in 2020]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Looking at "the wider Black
Sea area" over a medium-term perspective, a more complex array of
challenges is visible. In the Western Balkans, proposed land swaps and
[[France's veto]{.mark} [against]{.mark} the European Union
[expansion]{.mark} add tension to a vulnerable region at the heart of
Europe]{.underline}. To the south, Turkey's divergence from other NATO
members [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the development of **[[Russia's
offensive military capability]{.mark} development]{.underline}** and
projection into the Mediterranean **[[add fuel to the
fire]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Along Turkey's southern border, **[[Iraq
and Syria will be consumed]{.mark} by humanitarian
tragedies.]{.underline}** Finally, looking east, [China's
**[B]{.mark}**elt and **[R]{.mark}**oad **[I]{.mark}**nitiative [is
expanding]{.mark} Beijing's influence in the Black Sea]{.underline} and
into Europe more broadly. **[[Increased]{.mark} security and [stability
in the Black Sea will be essential.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[**To prevent further conflict, [American]{.mark}** and]{.underline}
European **[[policymakers should prioritize the Black Sea]{.mark} as [a
security region]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[At a
minimum]{.underline}**]{.mark}, sanctions against Russia should be
maintained. **[[The West should support]{.mark} [Ukraine's and
Georgia's]{.mark} sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as
their [Western path]{.mark}.]{.underline}** To prevent China's buying up
of the region, Western powers should consider offering infrastructure
investment opportunities as alternatives to a poor and underdeveloped
region while ensuring visibility with regard to regional public opinion.
Lastly, in the NATO framework, pressure should be exerted to prevent
Turkey from acting against collective interests.

#### Further Syrian escalation goes nuclear, draws in everyone 

**Lantier 19** \[Alex, PhD @ University of Geneva, \"Syrian army, Iran
threaten counterattack against Turkish invasion of Syria\", Oct 19,
2019, https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2019/10/14/syri-o14.html

[The [war unleashed by **Turkey's invasion**]{.mark} **of
Syria**]{.underline}, [targeting formerly US-backed Kurdish
forces]{.underline}, **[[escalated]{.mark} out of control]{.underline}**
[this weekend [as]{.mark} the **[Syria]{.mark}n army** [and
**Iran**]{.mark} moved to [counterattack]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[With **Turkish troops** and **allied Al Qaeda militias** advancing deep
into Kurdish-held territory in Syria]{.underline}, **[the [Middle East
is only days away from]{.mark} an [all-out war between]{.mark} the
[major]{.mark} regional [powers that]{.mark} could [trigger]{.mark} a
[global conflict between nuclear]{.mark}-armed world
[powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. UN reports show that [130,000 Syrians
have fled their homes in the region amid the Turkish
offensive]{.underline}, and Turkish officials claim they had
"neutralized" at least 415 Kurdish fighters. Turkish troops seized the
cities of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, amid heavy fighting including
ongoing Turkish air raids, and seizedddd a road crossing that cut off US
and Kurdish troops in Kobani. [Turkish troops also **fired artillery at
US troops**]{.underline} [near Kobani in what former US envoy Brett
McGurk said was "not a mistake,"]{.underline} although Turkish officials
later denied this. Turkey's Syrian "rebel" allies, the Islamist Syrian
National Army (SNA, formerly the Free Syrian Army), are executing
Kurdish civilians in areas they hold, according to multiple reports.
Kurdish politician Hevrin Khalaf was executed; her bullet-riddled car
appeared in a video surrounded by SNA fighters. Beyond Al Qaeda-linked
calls to destroy infidels, the British Daily Telegraph noted, the SNA's
main outlook "is sectarian: they are anti-Kurdish and they are Arab
chauvinists." Yesterday evening, the Syrian army announced it would
march on the area. The official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported:
"Syrian Arab Army units began moving north to confront Turkish
aggression on Syrian territory\... The movement comes to confront the
ongoing Turkish aggression on towns and areas in the north of Hasaka and
Raqqa provinces, where the Turkish forces committed massacres against
locals, occupied some areas and destroyed infrastructure." The Syrian
army has reportedly reached an agreement with the Kurdish-led Syrian
Democratic Forces (SDF) militia, whose alliance with the United States
was broken by Washington a week ago. Under this agreement, Syrian army
troops would reach the city of Kobani near the Syrian-Turkish border in
48 hours. On Saturday, President Donald Trump had authorized the
remaining 1,000 US troops in Kobani to withdraw, and US forces were in
full retreat across northern Syria this weekend to avoid being cut off
by advancing Turkish troops. Iran, which has deployed tens of thousands
of troops as well as drones to Syria in recent years to back the Syrian
regime against a NATO-led proxy war, indicated it would support the
Syrian army. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's Advisor for
International Affairs Ali Akbar Velayati met with Syrian Ambassador to
Iran Adnan Mahmoud yesterday in Tehran. He gave Iran's "full support to
Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity, calling for the
withdrawal of the Turkish forces," SANA reported. Velayati added, "The
principled policy of Iran is based on supporting the people and
government of Syria and defending their righteous stances in a way that
entails continuing joint cooperation until terrorism and terrorist
organizations are completely eliminated." At the same time, military
tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia are surging amid mutual attacks
on tankers carrying Persian Gulf oil supplies that are critical to the
world economy. Last month, the US and Saudi governments blamed a
September 14 missile attack on Saudi oil facilities that caused a sharp
rise in world oil prices on Iran, without providing any evidence. Then
on October 11, two missiles hit the Iranian tanker Sabiti off Saudi
Arabia's Red Sea coast. Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of the Iranian
Supreme National Security Council, said yesterday that Iran would
retaliate against unnamed targets for the attack on the Sabiti. "A
special committee has been set up to investigate the attack on
Sabiti\... Its report will soon be submitted to the authorities for
decision," Shamkhani told Fars News. "Piracy and mischief on
international waterways aimed at making commercial shipping insecure
will not go unanswered." Saudi officials declined to comment on the
Sabiti attack, and officials with the US Fifth Fleet in the Gulf
sheikdom of Bahrain claimed to have no information on it. But there is
widespread speculation in the international media that the attack was
carried out by Saudi Arabia or with its support. [The
**[conflicts]{.mark} erupting** between the different]{.underline}
capitalist [regimes in the Middle East [pose a]{.mark}n imminent
[threat]{.mark} not only to the population of the region]{.underline},

#### Russia is an offensive realist, just like every great power

**Rodríguez 15** \[Joaquín Ferro Rodríguez, Strategic Studies and
International Security Masters from the University of Granada, "Realism
vs Realism. The Change of Approach in The Eastern Border," June 30,
2015,
<http://www.seguridadinternacional.es/?q=es/content/realism-vs-realism-change-approach-eastern-border>\]

To begin with, I will explain why [[Russia can be
considered]{.underline}]{.mark} as **[[an offensive realist]{.mark}
actor]{.underline}**. It is not the aim of this paper to focus
excessively on theoretical classifications or philosophical debates.
However, [[due to **its explicative power**]{.mark} and **its
usefulness**]{.underline} t[o better comprehend the Russian behaviour,
it is worth mentioning]{.underline} three points belonging to [**the
offensive realist theory**: 1) great powers are rational actors whose
main goal is to survive]{.underline}\[1\]; [2) [**all great powers** are
**revisionist until**]{.mark} **the moment** [they become
heg]{.mark}emonic]{.underline}\[2\][; and 3) [for **a great power**, the
only way to guarantee]{.mark} its [security is to accumulate]{.mark} **a
bigger [power]{.mark} quota** than the rest]{.underline}\[3\]. Bearing
[in]{.underline} mind [these characteristics, Russian position finds a
coherent explanation]{.underline}. As Pierre Hassner puts it,
[["Russia's]{.mark} foreign [policy cannot be]{.mark} **fully
[understood]{.mark}** [without taking into account]{.mark} **the
postimperial [humiliation]{.mark} and [resentment]{.mark}** of the
Russian people [and]{.mark} **the neoimperial [ambition]{.mark}** of its
leaders"\[]{.underline}4\]. When the Cold War came to an end, Russian
leaders regarded the presence of the United States (U.S.) and NATO in
Europe positively as a way to keep a reunified Germany pacified.
Nevertheless, they did not expect the subsequent [NATO and]{.underline}
EU enlargement, which included the ex-soviet Baltic countries in
2004\[5\]. This fact, added to **[the 'colour
revolutions']{.underline}** taking place at the same time in Ukraine and
Georgia, [triggered **a feeling of dissatisfaction** within Russia and
the desire of recovering **its position as a great
power**]{.underline}\[6\]. The result is that, since 2004, [Russia
switched its]{.underline} - until that date - collaborative [approach
towards the West for **a tougher one**[. Behaving as **the offensive
realist**]{.mark} **great power** it wanted to become, [Russia
considers]{.mark}]{.underline} NATO/EU enlargements and their further
relations with countries belonging to **[[its
'backyard']{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially Ukraine and Georgia, [[as
a threat]{.underline}]{.mark}\[7\] [to its survival]{.underline}. In
order [[to face this]{.mark} threat, [Moscow needs to accumulate **more
power**]{.mark} **and influence**]{.underline}, above all in its direct
neighbourhood, which explains why "Putin's highest priority is to oppose
'colour revolutions'"\[8\] as well as to avoid the promotion of the EU's
normative power in those countries. Consequently, [he did not hesitate
to show **the Russian revisionist nature**]{.underline} when he felt
that national interests were at stake [[in Georgia and Ukraine.
In]{.underline}]{.mark} the summer of [[2008]{.underline}]{.mark}, after
President Mikheil Saakashvili's attempt to bring the separatist regions
of Abkhazia and South Ossetia back under Georgia's control,
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} decided to send the army to maintain the
Russian influence in those regions\[9\]. However, his [[goal was
not]{.mark} **uniquely [to preserve]{.mark}** [the s]{.mark}tatus [quo,
**but**]{.mark} **rather** to [revise it. In that]{.mark} conflict,
[Putin showed]{.mark} **for the first time [his]{.mark} true
[intentions]{.mark}** [to seize **any opportunity**]{.mark} **at his
disposal** [to]{.mark} [broaden]{.mark} his [influence and]{.mark} to
[keep his neighbour]{.mark} countries **[weak]{.mark} and [out
of]{.mark} the West's [reach]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In order to do so,
Putin chose direct means, namely [military intervention]{.underline} and
[war]{.underline}, to tackle the problem. On the other hand, indirect
means have been used in the Ukraine crisis for the same purpose. After
Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia [and]{.underline} a new pro-European
government reached the power in Kiev in February 2014, Russia has
promoted uprisings, [funded separatist groups]{.underline} and militias
in the eastern part of the country, annexed Crimea and sent arms and
unidentified military staff to support the pro-Russian groups. These two
different responses - direct and indirect - [are the Russian tools to
achieve **its revisionist goals** and not merely to defend the status
quo, as demonstrated with **the annexation of Crimea**]{.underline}.
These [revisionist movements]{.underline} have not only [benefited Putin
abroad]{.underline}, but also [within Russia, as his
popularity]{.underline} has [soared]{.underline}. This is a consequence
of **[[the]{.mark} powerful [propaganda machine]{.mark}ry of the
Kremlin]{.underline}**, which has been able to [[convince
citizens]{.mark} of [why Russia should be]{.mark} considered as [**a
great power** and]{.mark}]{.underline}, thus, to [[justify]{.mark} **its
international [behaviour]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The following points
summarise Putin's foreign policy and account for the theoretical base of
the interventions in Georgia and Ukraine: Russia is a great power which
shall preserve the sovereignty of the nation by all means.
[[This]{.mark} has been [translated]{.mark} in[to an increase of]{.mark}
the [military budget by **100%**]{.mark} **in the last 10
years**]{.underline}, as well as in the presence of Russia in the most
important international forums to enable them to participate in the
decisions regarding other zones of the world\[10\]. ["Russia and the
Russian world constitute **a 'singular civilization'**]{.underline},
neither Occidental nor Asian, which rests on the Christian values and a
'historical mission': [to defend the traditional values against a
materialist and decadent Occident"]{.underline}\[11\] (author's
translation). [The Russian Diaspora]{.underline}, meaning that "the
Russian people have become the largest people disperse worldwide"\[12\]
(author's translation). This situation [implies an obligation for Russia
to protect and defend Russian minorities wherever they
are]{.underline}\[13\].

### Black Sea Internal\-\--1AR

#### NATO Black Sea dominance key to prevent Russian expansion into the middle east

**Grygiel 19** \[Jakub Grygiel, associate professor of politics at The
Catholic University of America, December 12, 2019, "Russia's Return To
The Middle East," Hoover Institution,
https://www.hoover.org/research/russias-return-middle-east\]

The outcome of Russia's return to the region is unknown, of course. But
so far Putin has achieved two goals. First, Russia has maximized its
strategic possibilities by inserting itself into a cauldron of great
power competition. Second, the war in Syria is seen by Russian public
opinion as a good war, with low casualties and a dramatic improvement in
Russia's image as a world-class great power. More than 70% of Russians
support policies that are deemed to enhance the international status of
their country. [[Russia nourishes]{.underline} **[vast imperial
ambitions]{.underline}**]{.mark}, matched by Putin's personal
aspirations of proto-tsarist grandeur. [[It]{.mark} [is
unlikely]{.mark}, therefore, that [Putin will withdraw from the Middle
East]{.mark}]{.underline} on his own, as was the hope of many in the
Obama administration.

**[[How]{.underline}]{.mark}**, then, **[[can Russia be pushed back from
the Middle East]{.mark}?]{.underline}** How can it be induced to stop
destabilizing the region**[? [The answer may be in
Ukraine.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Now, as in the past, Russia has three main frontiers and lines of
expansion. The Eastern frontier in Asia is currently dormant because
China is too powerful and Moscow has no means to oppose it, choosing to
accept Beijing's economic predominance in exchange for Russian security
hegemony. The second front is the European or Western one, perhaps the
most examined and important because this is where a lot of bloody
clashes have occurred since the 17th century. Russia's westward push has
met here the greatest opponents, from Poland and Sweden in the 17th
century, to Prussia and Austria in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the
Atlantic alliance in the second half of the 20th century. And it is the
front that has attracted the most attention in the past decade, since
Putin has used military force to oppose the westward leaning posture of
two countries: Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014. Russia's wars
against these two states were clear attempts to oppose the West, seen as
encroaching upon states that Moscow deems part of its own empire or
hegemony. And these conflicts have achieved the most important strategic
objective pursued by Moscow: the effective end of Western enlargement.

But these [[military operations against Georgia and Ukraine are]{.mark}
also [part of Russia's efforts to extend influence toward
her]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**Southern** frontier. This]{.mark} is the
third vector [of Russian expansion, toward the **Black**]{.mark}
**[Sea]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, the **[Eastern
Mediterranean]{.underline}** [and the]{.underline} **[Middle
East]{.underline}**]{.mark}. It is a turbulent frontier that is
constantly fluctuating, with constantly changing and often ambiguous
alignments.

[[Ukraine]{.mark}, in particular, [is Russia's door t]{.mark}o Europe
but also [to the Black Sea]{.mark} and thus, farther out, to the
Mediterranean and the Middle East. **[Without Ukraine, Russia is an
Asian power]{.mark}**]{.underline}, left to face China on a lengthy
steppe frontier. With Ukraine, Russia is an empire that forces itself
into Europe's power dynamics. Paris and Berlin, not to mention capitals
closer to Russia, will have to take Russia seriously (albeit responding
with strategies that are often very different; Paris, for instance,
seeks a rapprochement with Moscow while Warsaw arms and pursues stronger
bilateral relations with the U.S.) in the moment Moscow has a foot in
Ukraine.

In the past three centuries, Russia's control over Crimea and the mouths
of the Don and Dnieper signaled a conflict with the Ottoman power to the
south, as Muscovite forces moved to project influence over the Black Sea
and the push their way to the Bosphorus. As a Prussian military leader
of the tsarist army said after taking over a key fortress near Crimea in
the early 18th century, Russia's presence there was a "splinter in the
enemy's foot."2 Such a description continues to be applicable. In the
moment Russia solidifies its presence on the shores of the Black Sea,
Turkey, and any other great power situated in the Middle East has to
deal with Moscow. To put it differently, over the past few years,
[[after Russia's wars in Ukraine and Georgia]{.mark}, and [then with her
military deployment in Syria, Turkey realized that Russia is not a land
power locked]{.mark} in the distant Muscovite core, [but a Black Sea
potentate]{.mark}]{.underline} that had to be taken into account. The
current problems in the U.S.-Turkey relationship are, therefore, caused
by Erdogan's Islamic authoritarian ways as much as by Russia's move into
the Middle East which has forced Ankara to seek a friendly modus vivendi
with Moscow.

From this, it follows that to check [[Russia's ability to insert herself
into Middle Eastern dynamics and]{.mark} to further [disrupt an already
volatile region]{.mark}]{.underline}, the U.S. and its allies should
strengthen Ukrainian geopolitical independence and weaken Russia's hold
over Crimea and eastern Ukraine. A strong independent Ukraine limits
Russian destabilizing southward push. To avoid a highly unpredictable
and **[costly great power competition]{.underline}** in the Middle East
-- a situation that would distract the United States from its more
pressing Pacific and European challenges -- it is thus best to consider
how to push Russia out of it. And the path to that goal runs through
Ukraine.

#### NATO Black Sea deterrence is crucial to regional stability \-\-- only NATO's presence prevents reckless Russian intervention into Syria 

**Coffey 20** \[Luke Coffey, had served at the UK Ministry of Defence
since 2010 as senior special adviser to then-British Defence Secretary
Liam, is the director of the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for
Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation, where he oversees research on

https://www.mei.edu/publications/while-us-not-black-sea-country-it-needs-be-black-sea-power\]

While the Baltic region is incredibly important for NATO, this lack of
focus on [[the Black Sea]{.underline}]{.mark} was unfortunate. The
region [[matters]{.mark} to the U.S. and its NATO allies. The Black Sea
is home to three NATO members]{.underline} (Romania, Turkey and
Bulgaria) [and two aspirant NATO countries that face partial Russian
occupation]{.underline} (Ukraine and Georgia). [Important oil and gas
transit links crisscross the region. So do many important fiber optic
cables and shipping lanes.]{.underline}

On the tactical level, Moscow's action in the region and its
militarization of Crimea furthers its goal of making the Black Sea a
Russian lake. Russia has deployed 28,000 troops to Crimea and has
embarked on a major program to build housing, restore airfields, and
install new radars there. In addition, [Russia has deployed advanced air
defense and anti-ship missiles that give it a leg up above the rest in
terms of controlling the surface and the skies above the Black
Sea]{.underline}.

**[On the strategic level]{.underline}**, [[Russia uses the Black Sea as
a **springboard** to **challenge U.S. interests**]{.mark}
**[elsewhere]{.mark} in the world**]{.underline}. For example,
[[Russia]{.mark} has [used]{.mark} its [Black Sea]{.mark}
presence]{.underline} on occupied Crimea [[to
launch]{.underline}]{.mark} and support naval
**[[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} [in support of]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Syrian President Bashar al-**[[Assad]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [In the
early days of]{.underline} Moscow's intervention in [Syria]{.underline},
the Moskva, [[a Russian navy guided]{.mark} missile [cruiser]{.mark},
[played a **vital role** in]{.mark} providing [air defense]{.mark} for
Russian forces]{.underline}. Hundreds of thousands of tons of grain and
wheat have been shipped from Crimea to Syria to help the Assad Regime's
food shortage problems. Hundreds of trips have been made between
Crimea's port city of Sevastopol and the Russian naval base in Tartus,
Syria to transport military hardware and resupplies.

Thankfully **[[policymakers are]{.mark} now [waking
up]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} For the U.S. three **[[Black Sea
countries]{.mark} can [play an]{.mark} [important role in America's
presence]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the region: Romania, Georgia and
Ukraine.

Romania is the most enthusiastic of all the Black Sea countries inside
NATO about maintaining a strong presence in the region. Romania has
sought closer military, economic, and political relations with the
United States. As Romania's new National Defense Strategy states about
Romanian-U.S. relations: "Romania aims at consolidating its military
cooperation with the United States, not just as a mere course of action
derived from our status as allies, but as an operational objective to be
implemented on the national territory."

When it comes to Black Sea security Romania also has a special role to
play serving as the confluence of the Danube River. This is especially
true as proposals have been made to use access to the Danube River as a
way to increase NATO presence in the Black Sea.

Romania has shown a willingness to step up to the plate when the
geopolitical situation requires. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014,
Bucharest became an outspoken supporter of Ukraine's territorial
integrity. And was one of the first countries in Europe to call for the
arming of the Ukrainian military in the face of Russian aggression.

Even before becoming a member of NATO Romania was willing to support
NATO led operations in the Balkans by giving access to its airspace for
operations. Romania has contributed troops to the NATO mission in
Kosovo. Thousands of Romanian troops have been deployed to Afghanistan
and Iraq to support US and NATO led operations in those countries.
Currently, Romania has more than 730 soldiers serving in Afghanistan.
Also, Mihail Romania's Kogalniceanu Air Base is a major logistics and
supply hub for U.S. equipment and personnel traveling to the Middle East
region.

Across the Black Sea from Romania, [Georgia is another important partner
for the U.S.]{.underline} After the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008,
and the subsequent occupation of 20 percent of its territory, Georgia
has transformed its military and has been steadfast in its support of
NATO, as well as non-NATO, U.S.-led overseas security operations.
Georgia has contributed thousands of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan, and
hundreds of peacekeepers to the Balkans and Africa. [Even with the
Russian invasion and its aftermath, Georgia has not been deterred from
getting closer to the West. This has made [Georgia]{.mark} a net
contributor to transatlantic security [and is a key part of any Black
Sea strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Georgia is important to the U.S. and NATO for three main reasons.

First, [Georgia is a proven and dependable ally in Iraq and
Afghanistan]{.underline}. In 2012, when many NATO countries were rushing
for the door in Afghanistan, Georgia added hundreds of troops to the
mission there. At the height of the Georgian contribution to
Afghanistan, it had more than 2,000 troops serving in some of the
deadliest places in the country, if not the world, in Helmand and
Kandahar Provinces. Today, Georgia has 870 troops in Afghanistan, making
it the largest non-NATO troop contributor to the NATO training mission.

Second, [located on the Black Sea]{.underline}, [[Georgia sits at a
crucial]{.mark} geographical and cultural
[crossroads]{.mark}]{.underline} and has proven itself to be
strategically important for military and economic reasons for centuries.
[Today Georgia offers its]{.underline} [territory]{.underline},
infrastructure, and logistic capabilities for the transit of NATO forces
and cargo for Afghanistan. Over the years, Georgia has modernized key
airports and port facilities in the country. This is particularly
important when it comes to the Black Sea region. **[Key
pipelines]{.underline}** like the Baku--Tbilisi--Ceyhan pipeline, the
Baku--Supsa pipeline, and the Southern Gas Corridor [transit through
Georgia]{.underline}, as do important rail lines like the recently
opened Baku--Tbilisi--Kars railway. [The **oil and gas pipelines are
particularly important to Europe's energy security**, and therefore
NATO's interest in the region]{.underline}.

Finally, Georgia's journey to democracy is an example for the region.
Since regaining independence in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet
Union, Georgia has been on a steady journey to democracy. Over the
years, successive Georgian governments have pursued an agenda of
liberalizing the economy, cutting bureaucracy, fighting corruption, and
embracing democracy.

As the target of Russia's most recent act of aggression in the region,
[Ukraine also plays an important role regarding stability and security
in the Black Sea.]{.underline}

Ukraine is in the midst of a national struggle that will determine its
future geopolitical orientation: the West or Moscow. The outcome of this
struggle will have long-term implications for the transatlantic
community and the notion of national sovereignty. Since 2014, almost 5
percent of Ukraine's landmass and more than half of its coastline have
been under illegal Russian occupation in Crimea.

Ukraine is not a member of NATO, and so it does not enjoy the Alliance's
security guarantee, but it was Kyiv's desire to join institutions such
as NATO and the EU that persuaded Russia to invade in 2014. Ukraine
represents the idea that countries in Europe should be free to choose
how and by whom they are governed, and which international organizations
and alliances they wish to join. No outside country, in this case
Russia, should have a veto.

With time **[[Ukraine has the potential to be]{.mark}come one of [the
most dominant powers]{.mark} [on the Black Sea]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
The U.S. has been investing and improving Ukraine's maritime
capabilities.

For different reasons Romania, Georgia and Ukraine play an important
role in the Black Sea. The U.S. can work more closely to enhance its
bilateral relationship and improve Black Sea security.

For Romania, the U.S. should look at ways to increase its presence in
the land and air domains in the country. This could mean U.S. troops and
fighter jets permanently based there. For years most of the U.S. and
NATO focus on the Black Sea has been the maritime domain. While this is
important, the land and air domains cannot be ignored.

[**[For both Georgia and Ukraine]{.underline}**, **[the U.S. must work
with NATO allies to ensure both are kept on]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[the path to]{.mark} eventual [membership into the
Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At the same time **[[the U.S. should
work with both to]{.mark} [improve their military
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

While **[[the U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline}** is not a Black Sea country, it
**[[needs to be a Black Sea power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To [make this
happen]{.underline} [Washington must **[build]{.mark} on its [relations
with]{.mark}**]{.underline} Romania, **[[Georgia and
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This will make America, NATO, and the
region safer.

#### Additional Russian incursions into Syria cause Russia-Israel war, which draws in the US and causes great power nuclear war 

**Peck 19** \[Michael Peck, "A Nuclear Nightmare: How a War Between
Russia and Israel Could Start," Nov 16, 2019,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/nuclear-nightmare-how-war-between-russia-and-israel-could-start-96861\]

**[The potential for war is real]{.underline}**.

Key point: In the end, **[either Israel or Russia will have to back
down]{.underline}**.

Could Israeli air strikes in Syria trigger war between Israel and
Russia?

Israel remains determined to continue pounding Iranian forces in Syria
in a bid to keep Tehran's forces away from Israel's northern border. At
the same time, [Russia]{.underline} has thousands of troops in Syria
that [could]{.underline} be caught in the crossfire---or even [become
belligerents if Moscow tires of its Syrian ally being
pummeled.]{.underline}

And **[if Israel and Russia come to blows]{.underline}**, [**would
Israel's big brother**---the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates---**[feel compelled to
intervene?]{.underline}**

Not that Jerusalem or Moscow are eager for such a fight. "Neither of us
desire a military confrontation," a senior Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
official told me during a recent interview in Jerusalem. "It would be
detrimental to both sides."

Yet **[Israel]{.underline}**'s policy boils down to this: it [will do
whatever it sees as necessary to **eject Iranian forces from
Syria**]{.underline}. [And if Russia doesn't like it, then that's just
the price of ensuring that Syria doesn't become another Iranian rocket
base on Israel's border.]{.underline}

Relations between Jerusalem and Moscow are far warmer than during the
Cold War. The result is a strange embrace reminiscent of the U.S.-Soviet
detente of the 1970s. On the surface, a certain friendliness and desire
for cooperation. Yet beneath the smiles is wariness, suspicion and a
clash of fundamental interests.

"**[No one in Israel]{.underline}** is confused about who the Russians
are and who they are aligned with," [said the IDF]{.underline} official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. "**[The Russians are not our
allies, to put it mildly.]{.underline}** We have one ally, and that is
the United States. **[The Russians are]{.underline}** here for totally
different objectives. They are **[supporting a regime \[Syria\] that has
an outspoken goal of annihilating Israel]{.underline}** if it only
could. They are also part of a coalition that supports Iran."

Just how easily Israeli military operations can trigger an incident
became evident during a September 2018 strike on ammunition depots in
western Syria. Anti-aircraft missiles launched by Syrian gunners
accidentally shot down a Russian Il-20 surveillance aircraft, killing
fifteen people. Israel denies Russian accusations that it deliberately
used the Russian plane as cover, or failed to give Moscow sufficient
warning of the raid. Yet Russia still blamed Israel for the mishap and
retaliated by supplying advanced S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to Syria.

Nonetheless, Israel sees value in Russia as a potential restraint on
Iran, and a possible lever to get Iranian forces out of Syria. After a
February meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President
Vladimir Putin to mend fences after the Il-20 incident, Israeli
officials claimed Putin had agreed that foreign forces should withdraw
from Syria. For Moscow, friendly relations with Israel offer more
influence in the Middle East even as America may be scaling down its
presence in the region.

Still, the Kremlin has denounced Israeli strikes in Syria as
"illegitimate." Syria has been a Russian ally for more than fifty years,
and it was Russian air strikes---along with Iranian and Hezbollah
troops---that saved Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's faltering regime
from ISIS and other rebel groups. At least 63,000 Russian troops have
served in Syria since 2015. Though Putin has promised since 2016 that
Russian forces would withdraw, Russia currently retains more than 5,000
troops and private military contractors in Syria, backed by several
dozen aircraft and helicopters.

And Russia is in Syria to stay. The Syrian port of Tartus is Russia's
only naval base in the Mediterranean: in 2016, Moscow and Damascus
signed a forty-nine-year agreement that allows nuclear-powered Russian
warships to operate from there. In addition, Russian aircraft and
surface-to-air missiles, including the long-range S-400 air defense
system, operate from at least two air bases in western Syria.

[Israel can live with the Russians next door---but not the
Iranians]{.underline}. Israeli officials warn of Tehran's plan to
station 100,000 Iranian and allied troops in Syria.
**[Hezbollah]{.underline}**, with its estimated arsenal of 130,000-plus
rockets, already **[menaces Israel's Lebanon frontier]{.underline}**.
**[Syria joining Lebanon]{.underline}** [as a second Iranian rocket base
is the stuff of **Israeli nightmares**]{.underline}.

"We can -- and we intend to -- make it as difficult as possible and
inflict a price tag that the Iranians aren't willing to pay," the IDF
official said. And the Israeli Air Force has been just doing that,
attacking "Iranian and Hezbollah targets hundreds of times," Netanyahu
announced after a devastating attack on Iranian arms depots near
Damascus International Airport in January.

"**[We continue to implement our plans]{.underline}**," the IDF official
replied when asked if Russia would deter Israeli raids into Syria. "Our
activities suggest that, despite everything, we enjoy significant
freedom of action."

But more telling was his one-word response when asked how willing is
Israel to fight for that freedom of action.

"Willing."

Which leaves the question: **[Can Israel target Iran in Syria without
triggering a clash with Russia]{.underline}**?

There are deconfliction mechanisms in place, including a hotline between
the Israeli and Russian militaries. "We are very strict about informing
the Russians about our activities and that their operational picture is
up to date," said the IDF official. Yet those procedures were not
sufficient to avoid a downing of a Russian plane.

Perhaps that ill-fated Il-20 was just at the wrong place at the wrong
time. Still, **[it is not hard to imagine a multiplicity of equally
fatal scenarios]{.underline}**. Russian [advisers]{.underline} or
technicians [caught in an Israeli raid]{.underline} on an Iranian or
Syrian installation. [An errant Israeli smart bomb]{.underline} that
[hits a Russian base]{.underline}, or a Russian pilot or anti-aircraft
battery spooked by a nearby Israeli raid into opening fire. Or,
**[perhaps Russia will just feel obligated to support the prestige of
its Syrian ally]{.underline}** and its shaky government. Just how
incendiary Syrian skies are for everyone became evident in December
2017, when U.S. F-22 fighters fired flares to warn off two Russian Su-25
attack jets that breached a no-go zone in eastern Syria.

To be clear, the IDF is neither boastful nor belligerent about its
capabilities versus Russia, a former superpower with the largest nuclear
arsenal on the planet. The IDF official likened Israel to "The Mouse
that Roared," the classic novel of a tiny nation that challenges the
United States.

But if [Israel]{.underline} resembles any mouse, it['s]{.underline}
Mighty Mouse: small, [powerful and not afraid to use its
fists]{.underline}. In fact, what makes a potential **[Israel-Russia
battle]{.underline}** so dangerous is that it **[is not
hypothetical]{.underline}**. [After]{.underline} the 1967 Six-Day War,
Soviet fighters were sent to Egypt. This led to a notorious July
[1970]{.underline} incident when in a well-planned aerial ambush over
the Suez Canal, [Israeli fighters shot down five
Soviet]{.underline}-piloted MiG-21 [jets]{.underline} in three minutes.

On the other hand, Russia doesn't need to fight Israel to hurt Israel.
Indeed, the IDF official seemed less concerned about a physical clash
between Israeli and Russian forces, and more concerned that Russia could
choose to supply advanced weapons---such as anti-aircraft missiles---to
Israeli enemies such as Syria and Iran. In the early 1970s, the Soviet
Union supplied numerous air defense missiles and guns to Egypt and
Syria, which inflicted heavy losses on Israeli planes in the 1973
October War. If it wants to, Russia can make Israeli air operations very
expensive.

As always with the Arab-Israeli (or Iranian-Israeli) conflict, **[the
real danger]{.underline}** isn't the regional conflict, but **[how it
might escalate]{.underline}**. In the 1973 war, [the Soviets
threatened]{.underline} to send troops to Egypt unless Israel agreed to
a cease-fire. [The United States responded by going on nuclear
alert.]{.underline}

[Were the Israelis and Russians to come to blows]{.underline}, or if
Moscow were to seriously threaten military force against Israel, [could
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[risk a grave
loss of prestige by not intervening to back its longtime
ally]{.underline}**? [Could Russia---**whose Syrian intervention is a
proud symbol of its reborn military muscle** and great power
status]{.underline}---**[not retaliate]{.underline}** for another downed
Russian plane or a dead Russian soldier?

Which leads to the ultimate question: **[could tensions between Israel
and Russia lead to a clash between American and Russian
troops]{.underline}**?

In the end, **[somebody will have to back down]{.underline}**. **[But
Iran isn't about to]{.underline}** give up its outpost on Israel's
border, and **[Russia]{.underline}** probably **[can't]{.underline}**
force them to. **[Then there is Israel]{.underline}**, which is grimly
determined to stop Iran.

As the IDF official said, "We have proven over more than 70 years as a
sovereign state that you don't push us around."

#### Goes nuclear 

**Beres 15** \[Louis Rene Beres, Professor of Political Science @ Purdue
University, "Israeli Deterrence in the Eye of the Hurricane," *Breaking
Israel News*, July 15, 2015, <http://tinyurl.com/pxxoyzd>\]

Sometimes, in strategic matters, seeing requires distance. [A [**nuclear
war** in the Middle East is not beyond possibility]{.mark}. This is a
sensible assessment even if Israel were to remain the only nuclear
weapons state in the region]{.underline}. How is this possible? [A
bellum atomicum could come]{.underline} to Israel not only as a "bolt
from the blue" enemy nuclear attack (either by a state or by a terrorist
group), but also [as the result]{.underline}, intended or otherwise,
[of]{.underline} certain uncontrolled [military
**escalations**.]{.underline} Needed prudence in such narratives calls
for additional specificity and precision. [[If]{.underline}]{.mark}
particular [Arab/Islamic enemy [states]{.mark}]{.underline} were to
[[launch conventional attacks upon Israel, Jerusalem could]{.mark} then
[respond]{.mark}]{.underline}, sooner or later,
[[with]{.mark}]{.underline} calculated and more-or-less calibrated
**[[nuclear reprisals]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Alternatively, if some of
these enemy states were to launch large-scale conventional attacks,
Jerusalem's own still-conventional reprisals could then be met, perhaps
even in the not-too-distant future, with enemy nuclear counterstrikes.
How should Israel prepare for such perilous contingencies? More than
likely, Israel has already rejected any doctrinal plans for fielding a
tactical/theater nuclear force, and for assuming any corollary nuclear
war fighting postures. It would follow further from any such
well-reasoned rejection that Israel should do whatever is needed to
maintain a credible conventional deterrent. By definition, such a
measured threat option could then function reliably across the entire
foreseeable spectrum of non-nuclear threats. Still, any such strategy
would need to include an appropriately complementary nuclear deterrent,
a distinctly "last resort" option that could display a "counter-value"
(counter-city) mission function. Si vis pacem, para bellum atomicum: "If
you want peace, prepare for atomic war." A persuasive Israeli
conventional deterrent, at least to the extent that it might prevent a
wide range of enemy conventional attacks in the first place, could
reduce Israel's growing risk of escalatory exposure to nuclear war. In
the always arcane lexicon of nuclear strategy, a complex language that
more-or-less intentionally mirrors the tangled coordinates of atomic
war, Israel will need to maintain firm control of "escalation
dominance." Otherwise, [the Jewish state could find itself engaged in an
elaborate but ultimately lethal pantomime of international bluster and
bravado]{.underline}. The reason for Israel's obligation to control
escalatory processes is conspicuous and unassailable. It is that
[[Jerusalem's]{.mark} main [enemies possess]{.mark} something that
Israel can plainly never have: [Mass]{.mark}]{.underline}. At some
point, as nineteenth century Prussian military thinker Carl von
Clausewitz asserts in On War: "Mass counts." Today, this is true even
though [[Israel's]{.mark} many [enemies are in **chaotic
disarray**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Now, [[amid]{.underline}]{.mark} what
Clausewitz had famously called "friction" and [[the "**fog of war**," it
could become harder for Israel to determine **real and pertinent
differences** between its allies, and]{.mark} its
[adversaries]{.mark}.]{.underline} As an example, Jordan could soon
become vulnerable to advancing IS forces. Acknowledging this new
vulnerability, an ironic question will come immediately to mind: Should
Israel support the Jordanian monarchy in such a fight? And if so, in
what specific and safe operational forms? Similarly ironic questions may
need to be raised about Egypt, where the return to military dictatorship
in the midst of surrounding Islamist chaos could eventually prove both
fragile and transient. Should President Abdel Fattah Sisi fail to hold
things together, the ultimate victors could be not only the country's
own Muslim Brotherhood, but also, in nearby Gaza, Palestinian Hamas.
Seemingly, however, Hamas is already being targeted by Islamic State, a
potentially remorseless opposition suggesting, inter alia, that the
principal impediment to Palestinian statehood is not really Israel, but
another Sunni Arab terrorist organization. Of course, it is not entirely
out of the question that IS's Egyptian offshoot, the so-called "Sinai
Province of Islamic State," could sometime decide to cooperate with
Hamas -- the Islamic Resistance Movement -- rather than plan to it. To
further underscore the area's multiple and cross-cutting axes of
conflict, it is now altogether possible that if an IS conquest of Sinai
should spread to Gaza, President Sisi might then "invite" the IDF to
strike on Egypt's behalf. Among other concerns, Egypt plainly fears that
any prolonged inter-terrorist campaign inside Gaza could lead to a
literal breaking down of border fences, and an uncontrolled mass flight
of Palestinians into neighboring Sinai. Credo quia absurdum. "I believe
because it is absurd." With such peculiar facts in mind, why should
Israel now sustain a conventional deterrent at all? Wouldn't enemy
states, at least those that were consistently rational, steadfastly
resist launching any conventional attacks upon Israel, for fear of
inciting a nuclear reprisal? Here is a plausible answer: [suspecting
that Israel would cross the nuclear threshold only in extraordinary
circumstances, these national foes could be convinced]{.underline},
rightly or wrongly, [that as long as their initial attacks were to
remain conventional, Israel's response would remain reciprocally
non-nuclear]{.underline}. By simple extrapolation, this means that the
only genuinely effective way for Israel to continually deter large-scale
conventional war could be by maintaining visibly capable and secure
conventional options. As for Israel's principal non-state adversaries,
including Shi'ite Hezbollah and Sunni IS, their own belligerent
calculations would be detached from any assessments of Israeli nuclear
capacity and intent. After all, whatever attacks they might sometime
decide to consider launching against the Jewish state, there could never
be any decipherable nuclear response. Nonetheless, these non-state
jihadist foes are now arguably more threatening to Israel than most
enemy national armies, including the regular armed forces of Israel's
most traditional enemies -- Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Some other
noteworthy nuances now warrant mention. Any still-rational Arab/ Islamic
enemy states considering firststrike attacks against Israel using
chemical and/or biological weapons would likely take Israel's nuclear
deterrent more seriously. But a strong conventional capability would
still be needed by Israel to deter or to preempt certain less
destructive conventional attacks, strikes that could escalate quickly
and unpredictably to assorted forms of unconventional war. If
Arab/Islamic enemy states did not perceive any Israeli sense of
expanding conventional force weakness, these belligerent countries, now
animated by credible expectations of an Israeli unwillingness to
escalate to nonconventional weapons, could be more encouraged to attack.
The net result here could be: 1) defeat of Israel in a conventional war;
2) defeat of Israel in an unconventional (chemical/biological/ nuclear)
war; 3) defeat of Israel in a combined conventional/unconventional war;
or 4) defeat of Arab/Islamic enemy states by Israel in an unconventional
war. For Israel, even the presumptively "successful" fourth possibility
could prove too costly. [Perceptions are vitally important]{.underline}
in all calculations of nuclear deterrence. [[By continuing to
keep]{.underline}]{.mark} every element of [its nuclear armaments and
doctrine ["opaque," Israel]{.mark}]{.underline} could unwittingly
[[contribute to the]{.mark} injurious [impression]{.mark}]{.underline}
among its regional enemies [that [Jerusalem's nuclear weapons were
unusable]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Unconvinced of Israel's willingness
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [actually [employ]{.mark} its nuclear [weapons,
these enemies could]{.mark} then decide to **[accept the
cost-effectiveness of striking first]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [With any
such acceptance, Israeli nuclear [deterrence will have
failed]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If enemy states should turn out to be
correct in their calculations, Israel could find itself
overrun]{.underline}, and thereby rendered subject to potentially
existential harms. [If they had been incorrect, **[many states]{.mark}
in the region**, including even Israel, [could]{.mark}]{.underline}
eventually [[suffer]{.mark} the assorted [consequences of **multiple
nuclear weapons detonations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Within the directly
affected areas, [thermal radiation, nuclear radiation and blast damage
would then spawn uniquely high levels of death and
devastation]{.underline}.

[[The Iranians]{.underline}]{.mark} and Syrians [[and their
Hezbollah]{.underline}]{.mark} allies/[[proxies have a considerable
selection of WMD]{.underline}]{.mark} available for these 40,000 to
60,000 rockets/missiles (in addition to their Syrian and Iranian based
longer range missiles). The WMD can range from
**[[FAE]{.underline}]{.mark}** (fuel air explosive)
**[[warheads]{.underline}]{.mark}** (which if fired in a coordinated
pattern can lay down a FAE 'brew' over a wide area, such as over a
heavily populated urban area) and achieve PSI (pounds per square inch)
levels higher than standard NATO tactical nuclear warheads. The WMD can
also include [[chemical]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[warheads]{.underline}]{.mark} of various types. Syria and Iran have
one of the largest (if not the largest) joint chemical warfare programs
on Earth. Additionally, they can use Advanced Biologically produced
[[biotoxin warheads]{.underline}]{.mark} for a longer lasting chemical
war 'effect'. They can also use 'dirty bombs', that is Radiological
warheads using things like Cobalt 60 and Strontium 90, which give the
'effect' of radiological fallout without using a nuclear blast. They can
also use Radiological weapons encased in an advanced matrix containing
hard to remove glue, so that the radioactive particles are glued to
buildings, cars, etc., making any decontamination efforts most
difficult. The Israelis see these rockets/missiles and their assorted
warheads as a grave threat. The Second Lebanon War was planned as the
first step in a war against Syria and Iran but the low-cost but powerful
AT-14 Russian built and supplied anti-tank missiles proved too much for
the IDF armor; the losses were simply too high. This time the IDF will
be using different tactics, strategies, and weapons. Both Syria and
Lebanon have make it very clear, over the last few months, that any
large-scale Israeli attack on Lebanon/Hezbollah will be considered an
attack on them and will immediately trigger a regional war with
themselves and Israel. They simply cannot allow Israel to destroy the
rocket/missile element to their MAD counter-force, as they know that the
Syrian and Iranian homelands would be next. So any war on
Lebanon/Hezbollah means a General Middle East War from day one. **[[Any
Third Lebanon War]{.underline}]{.mark}**/General Middle East War **[[is
apt to involve WMD]{.underline}]{.mark}** on both side **[[quickly as
both sides know the stakes]{.underline}]{.mark}** and that the Israelis
are determined to end, once and for all, [any Iranian opposition to a
\'Greater Israel\' domination of the entire Middle East. It will be a
case of **[\'use your WMD or lose]{.mark}** **[them\']{.mark}** to enemy
strikes. Any massive [WMD usage against Israel will result in]{.mark}
the usage of Israeli [thermonuclear warheads against Arab and Persian
populations]{.mark} centers in large parts of the Middle
East,]{.underline} with the resulting spread of radioactive fallout over
large parts of the Northern Hemisphere. However, [the first use of nukes
is apt to be lower yield warheads directed against Iranian underground
facilities]{.underline} including both nuclear sites and governmental
command and control and leadership bunkers, with some limited strikes
also likely early-on in Syrian territory. [The [Iranians]{.mark} are
well [prepared to launch]{.mark} a global Advanced **[Biological Warfare
terrorism]{.mark}** based strike [against]{.mark} not only
[Israel]{.mark}]{.underline} and American and allied forces in the
Middle East [but also against the American, Canadian, British, French,
German, Italian, etc., homelands. [This will]{.mark} utilize [DNA
recombination]{.mark} based genetically [engineered \'super killer
viruses\' that]{.mark} are designed to [spread]{.mark} themselves
throughout the world [using humans as vectors]{.mark}. There are very
few defenses against such warfare, other than total quarantine of the
population until all of the different man-made viruses]{.underline} (and
there could be dozens or even over a hundred different viruses released
at the same time) h[ave \'burned themselves out\'.]{.underline} This
could kill a third of the world\'s total population. [[Such a
result]{.mark} from an Israeli triggered war would almost certainly
[cause a Russian-Chinese response]{.mark} that would eventually finish
off what is left of Israel and [begin a]{.mark} truly global

Conventional Defeat

The idea that Israel might lose a conventional war seems ridiculous now,
but [[the origins of the Israeli nuclear program lay in the fear that
the Arab states would develop a decisive military advantage]{.mark} that
they could use to inflict battlefield]{.underline} defeats. This came
close to happening during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, as the Egyptian Army
seized the Suez Canal and the Syrian Arab Army advanced into the Golan
Heights. Accounts on how seriously Israel debated using nukes during
that war remain murky, but **[there is no question]{.underline}** that
[[Israel could consider using its]{.mark} most [powerful weapons if the
conventional balance tipped]{.mark} decisively out of its
favor.]{.underline}

How might that happen? We can imagine a few scenarios, most of which
involve an increase in hostility between Israel and its more tolerant
neighbors. Another revolution in Egypt could easily rewrite the security
equation on Israel's southern border; while the friendship of Saudi
Arabia seems secure, political instability could change that; even
Turkish policy might shift in a negative direction. Israel currently has
overwhelming conventional [[military advantages,]{.mark} but these
advantages [depend]{.mark} to some extent [on a favorable regional
strategic environment. Political shifts could leave Israel]{.mark}

### Russia Deterred Now\-\--2AC

#### NATO is expanding their army 6x -- deters Russia and thumps every disad. 

**Carbonaro 6/23** -- Giulia Carbonaro, Reporter @ Newsweek, casual
roller skater!!! 6-23-2022, \"NATO to massively expand army in bid to
deter further Putin aggression,\" Newsweek,

accessed 6-24-2022 -- OBERTO!

[**[NATO]{.mark}** is preparing to [expand its army]{.mark} in response
to Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}, according to Sky News
Security and Defense Editor Deborah Haynes.

[[The military alliance](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato) has been
forced to rethink the way it can deter the aggressive ambitions of
Russian President [Vladimir
Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin) in
Europe]{.underline}, she reported. Moscow\'s [assault on
Ukraine]{.underline}, which isn\'t a NATO member, has [added urgency to
the organization\'s long-standing but stalled defense
plans.]{.underline}

\"[Overnight **[the mentality changed]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" an
unnamed NATO officer told Haynes. \"[[NATO]{.mark} now feels like it [is
**electrified**]{.mark}. You can feel the energy surging through the
system]{.underline}.\"

Separately, a diplomat told the Sky News editor that \"[[a radical
change]{.mark} in posture\" is expected [to emerge from the NATO
summit]{.mark} in Spain between [June]{.mark} 28 and
[30]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Officials at the gathering will discuss how [NATO\'s]{.mark}
40,000-strong [Response Force]{.mark}]{.underline} (NRF) [[will be
rebranded and made]{.mark} up to **[six times
larger]{.mark}**]{.underline}, according to Haynes. [The
[overhaul]{.mark}, the [biggest]{.mark} in NATO [since the Cold
War]{.mark}, would rename the NRF the Allied Reaction Force
(AFR),]{.underline} according to the Sky News editor. Her source at NATO
said the final increase in numbers will probably be lower than that.

Another possible change to be implemented will be an [[increase
in]{.mark} the size of the NATO mission in the alliance\'s eastern and
southeastern flank]{.underline}, with [[thousands]{.mark} more
[troops]{.mark} expected to be based in their home nations and only
being deployed if needed.]{.underline}

[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} could also [decide to [designate
Russia]{.mark} as the \"[most significant and direct
threat]{.mark}\"]{.underline} to security, wrote Haynes, and to [approve
a new \"comprehensive assistance package\" for Ukraine.]{.underline}

In a statement delivered on April 6 ahead of the meeting of NATO\'s
ministers of foreign affairs, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg talked
of the war in Ukraine as having \"long term implications\" for NATO
security, \"because we have seen the brutality,\" he said.

\"We have seen the willingness by President Putin to use military force
to reach his objectives. And that has changed the security reality in
Europe for many, many years. So therefore, we have started the process
in NATO, we have tasked our military commanders to provide options for
the political leaders to take decisions on how to reset our deterrence
and defense for the long term. This will of course, build on what we
have already done,\" Stoltenberg said then.

[NATO has already reinforced its collective defense in response to
Russia\'s aggressive campaigns against its neighbor, when it tripled the
size of the NRF in 2014]{.underline} following Putin\'s annexation of
Crimea.

\"So we, [NATO]{.underline}, \[were\] actually [quite well prepared when
Russia invaded Ukraine for the second time]{.underline}, and on the day
of the invasion, [we activated our defense plans, deployed 1000s of
additional troops in the eastern part of the Alliance. Now there are
40,000 troops on the NATO command in the eastern part of the
Alliance]{.underline}. And there are more U.S. troops in Europe, 100,000
in total, and other Allies have also increased their presence,\"
Stoltenberg said.

\"We were well prepared when they invaded Ukraine. But now [we need to
take a [new step]{.mark}, for a more long term [strengthening]{.mark} of
our **[deterrence and defense]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" the secretary
general said in April, adding that \"decisions for the longer term will
be made at the summit in Madrid in June when the heads of state and
government meet.\"

The meeting in Madrid next week will also be marked by disappointment
surrounding the obstacles now faced by Sweden and Finland in their bid
to join NATO. Both the alliance and the two Nordic countries expected
the membership process to be swift and smooth, but were caught by
surprise by Turkey\'s strong opposition to their candidacy ---especially
Sweden\'s.

Ankara has accused Stockholm of sheltering terrorists from the Kurdistan
Workers\' Party (PKK).

### Russia Deterred Now\-\--1AR

#### Finland and Sweden joining NATO solve deterrence.

- ALSO thump NATO bad because Putin retaliates to their joining

**Buddhavarapu 5/12**-- Ravi Buddhavarapu BA @ Delhi University,
05-12-2022, "Finland and Sweden joining NATO will help deter Russia,
says security analyst," CNBC,
https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/12/finland-and-sweden-joining-nato-will-help-deter-russia-says-security-analyst.html,
accessed 6-24-2022 -- OBERTO!

[A decision by [Finland and Sweden]{.mark} to [join NATO]{.mark} will
**[improve deterrence]{.mark} against Russia** in northern Europe
[and]{.mark} add to the U.S.-led military alliance's
**[security]{.mark}**]{.underline}, one analyst from Atlantic Council
told CNBC on Thursday.

Her comments came right before [Finland's President Sauli Niinisto and
Prime Minister Sanna Marin announced their country should apply to join
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization "without delay." ]{.underline}

"[[NATO membership]{.mark} would [strengthen]{.mark} Finland's
[security]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a member of NATO, Finland would
strengthen the entire defense alliance," they said in a joint statement.

[A similar announcement from Sweden is expected later this
week.]{.underline}

"[Sweden and Finland joining NATO [will increase deterrence in the
region because of the assets they]{.mark} will [provide]{.mark} the
alliance]{.underline}. And \[because of\] the ability to plan for
Northern Europe's security in a comprehensive manner," said the Atlantic
Council's Northern Europe director Anna Weislander. 

[[Membership]{.underline}]{.mark} of the political and military alliance
[will be a [historic decision]{.mark} for Finland, which shares a
1,300-kilometer border with Russia]{.underline}. The Nordic
nation adopted neutrality after its defeat by the Soviet Union in World
War Two. [Sweden, too, has not been part of any military alliances for
more than 200 years.]{.underline}

Weislander said [both the [countries]{.mark} were [well prepared to
meet]{.mark} the oft-repeated political and military [threats by
Russia]{.mark}n President Vladimir Putin who opposes their
membership]{.underline}.

"President Putin and [Russia have several times already declared that
there will be military and political consequences]{.underline}," she
said on "Capital Connection," adding she expected more of such warnings
in the coming days.

"[[We have prepared]{.mark}. We have moved military installations... and
[expect]{.mark} \[Russian\] [cyber]{.mark} attacks, electronic
[jamming]{.mark} or more [airspace]{.mark} intrusions]{.underline}," she
said, noting that both Sweden and Finland were members of the European
Union.

"Sweden and Finland are solid democracies with sophisticated economies
and will, therefore, also contribute to the underlying values of the
alliance," Weislander said.

[The armed forces of both countries enjoy high compatibility with NATO
members states too, she added.]{.underline}

"[Finland is already a security provider. It has a strong military, it
is small but technically sophisticated]{.underline}. It can not only
defend itself despite a long border with Russia but it has also,
alongside Sweden, worked with NATO on international missions from the
Balkans to Afghanistan. And they have practiced extensively," Weislander
said.

Both countries are "operable" as NATO members, she said. ″\[They\] have
worked with NATO since the mid-1990s in international missions," the
analyst said, citing those in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Libya. "They
have also participated in advanced exercises with NATO, such as Trident
Juncture. And there were hundreds of other exercises." "So their
interoperability is not a problem," Weislander said. Sweden and Finland
also cooperate extensively on defense with each other based on NATO
standards, she added.

[If both countries join NATO, this would signal an "open
door]{.underline}" NATO policy, Weislander said.

"[When countries are ready to join and can contribute to the security of
the whole of the transatlantic area, then \[NATO\] will be ready to take
on new members as well]{.underline}. There will be no closed door for
NATO," she said.

Institute of Technology; and Erik Gartzke, Professor, University of

Throughout the latter half of 2021, as it became clear that Russia was
massing a large portion of its conventional combat power on the eastern
borders of Ukraine, [analysts offered contrasting predictions about the
role cyberspace would play in an armed conflict.]{.underline} These
predictions capture an ongoing debate about whether conflict in
cyberspace is destined to [supplant conventional
conflict](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/12/putin-does-not-need-invade-ukraine-get-his-way) or
exacerbate it.

[As the war has evolved, it's clear that [analysts]{.mark} on both sides
of the debate [**got it wrong**. Cyber op]{.mark}erations [did not
replace]{.mark} the [military]{.mark} invasion]{.underline}, and as far
as we can tell, the [[Russia]{.mark}n government
[has ]{.mark}[[not]{.mark} yet [used cyber]{.mark}
operations](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/opinion/russia-ukraine-cyberattacks.html) as
an integral [part of its military
campaign](https://www.vox.com/2022/3/19/22986316/russia-ukraine-cyber-attacks-holding-back)]{.underline}.

We are [political scientists]{.underline} who study the role
of [cybersecurity](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2jdVG2wAAAAJ&hl=en) and [information](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8zd54PAAAAAJ&hl=en) in
international conflict. [[Our
[research]{.mark}](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x4xxw0wgb1jgx7f/CCO_GK_112121.pdf?dl=0) shows]{.underline}
that the reason [pundits]{.underline} on both sides of the argument [got
it wrong is because they [failed to consider]{.mark} that [cyber]{.mark}
and military operations [serve different]{.mark} political
[objectives]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Cyber operations are most effective in pursuing informational goals,
such as gathering intelligence, stealing technology or winning public
opinion or diplomatic debates]{.underline}. In contrast, [nations use
military operations to occupy territory, capture resources, diminish an
opponent's military capability and terrorize a population]{.underline}.

**[A tactical role for cyberattacks?]{.underline}**

It's common in [modern warfare]{.underline} for [new technologies to
substitute for traditional military tactics]{.underline}. For example,
the U.S. has made extensive use of [drones]{.underline}, including in
conflicts in Yemen and Pakistan where crewed aircraft and ground forces
would be difficult or impossible to use. Because [drones allow the U.S.
to fight on the cheap with much less risk, they substitute for other
forms of warfare.]{.underline}

In theory, [cyber operations could have played a similar tactical role
in Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. But [the [Russian
gov]{.mark}ernment [has ]{.mark}[**[yet to use cyber]{.mark}**
operations](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/opinion/russia-ukraine-cyberattacks.html) in
a manner that is clearly coordinated [with military
units]{.mark}]{.underline} and designed to smooth the advance of ground
or air forces. When Russia invaded Ukraine, hackers [disrupted access to
satellite
communications](https://www.wired.com/story/viasat-internet-hack-ukraine-russia/) for
thousands of people, and it was apparently a [concern for Ukrainian
defense
officials](https://twitter.com/Bing_Chris/status/1503749157995094016).
But [overall, [Ukraine]{.mark} has managed to [[maintain
internet]{.mark}
access](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/29/ukraine-internet-faq/) and [cellphone
service](https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-ukraine-war-keeping-phones-online-becomes-key-defense-11648123200) for
most of the country.]{.underline}

Russia
has [sophisticated](https://www.c4isrnet.com/cyber/2022/02/14/russia-and-china-devote-more-cyber-forces-to-offensive-operations-than-us-says-new-report/) cyber
capabilities, and its hackers have [worked their way into Ukrainian
networks](https://www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-attack-ukraine/) for
many years. This raises the question of why Russia has not, for the most
part, [used cyber operations to provide tactical
support](https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/597272-where-is-russias-cyber-blitzkrieg) for
its military campaigns in Ukraine, at least until this point.

**[Separate roles]{.underline}**

In recent studies, we examined whether [cyber operations]{.underline}
mostly [serve as complements to]{.underline}, or substitutes for,
[conventional conflict]{.underline}. In [one
analysis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x4xxw0wgb1jgx7f/CCO_GK_112121.pdf?dl=0),
we examined [conventional [military campaigns around the
world](https://www.isanet.org/Conferences/Toronto-2019)]{.underline} over
a 10-year period using the [[Militarized Interstate
Disputes](https://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/MIDs) dataset]{.underline}
of all armed conflicts. We also [focused on [the conflicts in [Syria
and]{.mark} eastern
[Ukraine]{.mark}](https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002717737138). Our results
suggest that [cyber]{.mark} operations are generally [not]{.mark} being
**[used as either.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Instead, [[nations]{.mark} tend to [use]{.mark} these two types of
[operations independently]{.mark} from each other]{.underline} because
each mode of conflict serves different objectives, and [cyberwarfare is
most effective for gathering intelligence, stealing technology or
winning public opinion or diplomatic debates.]{.underline}

In contrast, [nations use traditional forms of conflict to control
tangible assets]{.underline}, such as capturing resources or occupying
territory. The various goals offered by Russian President Vladimir Putin
for invading Ukraine, such as [preventing Ukraine from joining
NATO](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/russia-worried-ukrainian-military-buildup-81487170), [replacing
the
government](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-claims-denazification-justify-russias-attack-ukraine-experts-say-rcna17537) or [countering
fictitious Ukrainian weapons of mass
destruction](https://thebulletin.org/2022/03/ukraine-building-a-nuclear-bomb-dangerous-nonsense/),
require occupying territory.

There may be other reasons for the lack of overlap between cyber and
conventional fronts in Ukraine. [The [Russia]{.mark}n military could
[consider cyber]{.mark} operations **[ineffective]{.mark}** for its
purposes.]{.underline} The [newness of cyber operations as a tool of war
makes it [difficult to
coordinate](https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002717737138) with conventional
military operations]{.underline}. Also, military targets might not be
accessible to hackers because they might lack internet connectivity.

In any
event, [[[evidence](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x4xxw0wgb1jgx7f/CCO_GK_112121.pdf?dl=0) that
the Russia]{.mark}n government [intends to use cyber]{.mark} operations
to [complement](https://www.rand.org/blog/2021/12/expect-shock-and-awe-if-russia-invades-ukraine.html) military
operations
**[is [thin](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0022002717737138)]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Our findings suggest [hacking groups in previous conflicts faced
considerable difficulties in responding to battlefield events, much less
shaping them.]{.underline}

"The [[negligible]{.mark} role of **[cyberattacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}
in the Ukraine conflict [should come as [no surprise]{.mark}. Through
[war simulations, statistical analyses and]{.mark} other kinds of
[studies, scholars]{.mark} have [found little evidence]{.mark} that
[cyber op]{.mark}erations [provide effective]{.mark} forms of [coercion
or]{.mark} that they **[cause escalation]{.mark}** to actual military

["[For all its potential]{.mark} to disrupt]{.underline} companies,

[Even as fighting in [Ukraine intensifies]{.mark}]{.underline} around

True,[ expert
observations](https://github.com/curated-intel/Ukraine-Cyber-Operations) are
reporting more widespread espionage, phishing campaigns, and
disinformation efforts linked to established threat actors from within
Russian IP space following the country's invasion. But the [**[cyber

commentators](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/28/russia-cyber-army-ukraine-00003051) simply
[hasn't happened.]{.mark}]{.underline} 

**[The Sensibility of Russian Cyber Restraint]{.underline}**

As[ several academics have pointed
out](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/07/putins-invasion-ukraine-didnt-rely-cyber-warfare-heres-why/),
this [[lack of a lightning]{.mark} digital [volley]{.mark} from Russia
makes a lot of sense]{.underline}. It [[corresponds
with]{.underline}]{.mark} what [[**[years of
research]{.mark}**](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/techland-when-great-power-competition-meets-digital-world/russian-cyber-war-ukraine-was-fantasy) into
cyber conflict]{.underline} tells us about why nations build such
capabilities. [[Cyber]{.mark} operations are [useful for
espionage]{.mark} and reconnaissance, sabotage, and for subversion. They
are useful, in short, for shaping international affairs to create
favorable conditions. What they're [not]{.mark} good for is coercion or
for significantly enhancing **[battlefield
effectiveness]{.mark}**]{.underline}, not least because they tend to
produce temporary effects.

The [geopolitical and operational contexts of Russia's war]{.underline}
against Ukraine[[ also
explain](https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/597272-where-is-russias-cyber-blitzkrieg) why
a cyber onslaught has not occurred.]{.underline} After all, if Vladimir
Putin's plan is to resurrect a defeated Ukraine as a puppet bulwark
against NATO expansion, [there's [little point in breaking what's being
bought]{.mark}]{.underline}. Temporary [disruption of certain
services]{.underline} might help the war effort but manufactured
calamity just [makes the reconstruction job of a victorious Russia that
much harder]{.underline}. Added to that was [[Putin's]{.mark} clear
[over-reliance on]{.mark} the [conventional forces]{.mark} of the
Russian military to achieve a quick victory]{.underline}. By some
estimates, [Russia intended Kyiv and the Ukrainian government to fall as
quickly as Kabul to the Taliban in 2021]{.underline}. In such a
scenario, the use of Russia's most sophisticated cyber instruments would
have been wasteful and expensive. [That scenario did not come to
pass,]{.underline} of course---something that just adds to our
understanding of the [relative [**irrelevance** of Russian cyber]{.mark}
activities]{.underline}. Clearly, [the **[logistical mess]{.mark}** seen
in the first two weeks of the Russia-Ukraine war has made it difficult
for Russia's cyber forces to effectively augment the military's kinetic
capabilities.]{.underline}

**[A Coming "[Cyberwar]{.mark}"? [Not Likely.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

In spite of Russia's relative restraint in cyberspace,[ media
reports](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/09/catastrophic-cyber-war-ukraine-russia-hasnt-happened-yet-experts-say) and
even[ some practitioner
assessments](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-10/transcript-here-s-what-a-cyber-war-with-russia-may-actually-look-like) continue

"cyberwar"](https://gulfnews.com/opinion/op-eds/why-the-world-needs-to-be-prepared-for-cyberwars-1.85906500) in
which Moscow strikes back at the West for its support of Ukraine.
Certainly, there is some room for concern. Russia has increasingly
turned to the use of its "gray zone" capacities for disrupting Western
competitors and degrading their ability to act. And yet,
[[warnings]{.mark} about digital disasters to come persistently
[fail]{.mark} to place the Russian cyber threat in a **[strategic
context]{.mark}**, even [as experts leverage]{.mark} astute geopolitical
[analysis]{.mark} to help make sense of current patterns.]{.underline}

MONS, Belgium (Reuters) - [A new NATO military command center to deter
computer hackers should be fully staffed in 2023 and able to mount its
own cyber attacks]{.underline} but the alliance is still grappling with
ground rules for doing so, a senior general said on Tuesday. While NATO
does not have its own cyber weapons, [the U.S.-led alliance established
an operations center on Aug. 31]{.underline} at its military hub in
Belgium. [The United States, Britain, Estonia and other allies
have]{.underline} since [offered their cyber capabilities]{.underline}.
"This is an emerging domain and the threat is growing," said Major
General Wolfgang Renner, a German air force commander who oversees the
new cyber operations center, or CYOC, in Mons. "[We have to be prepared,
to be able to execute operations in cyberspace]{.underline}. We have
already gone beyond protection and prevention," he told Reuters during a
NATO cyber conference. NATO communication and computer networks face
hundreds of significant hacking attempts every month, according to the
NATO Communication and Information Agency, while experts say Russia,
North Korea and China are constantly deploying sophisticated computer
hacking weapons and surveillance software. Accusations by Western
governments this month that Russia waged a global hacking campaign have
raised the profile of NATO's evolving strategy as allied governments
look for a response. The European Union on Monday discussed its options,
including a special economic sanctions regime to target cyber attackers.
"[Our ultimate aim is to be completely aware of our
cyberspace]{.underline}, to understand minute-by-minute the state of our
networks so that commanders can rely on them," said Ian West, chief of
cyber security at the NATO communication agency. When fully operational,
[the cyber center aims to coordinate NATO's cyber deterrent through a
70-strong team of experts fed with military intelligence]{.underline}
and real-time information about hackers ranging from Islamist militants
to organized crime groups operating on behalf of hostile governments.
ARTICLE 5 DEBATE [NATO has formally recognized cyberspace as a new
frontier in defense]{.underline}, along with land, air and sea, meaning
battles could henceforth be waged on computer networks. [The center
could potentially use cyber weapons that can knock out enemy missiles or
air defenses, or destroy foes' computer networks if commanders judge
such a cyber attack is less harmful to human life than a traditional
offensive with live weaponry]{.underline}. That is now the subject of
intense debate at NATO, with alliance commanders saying publicly that
cyber will be an integral part of future warfare but allies unclear what
would trigger NATO's Article 5 (collective defense) clause. "Our concept
of operations, a toolbox for short-notice decisions about how to
respond, is not in place yet. This is one of the challenges we face,"
Renner said. [If NATO can agree cyber warfare principles, the alliance
hopes to integrate individual nations' cyber capabilities into alliance
operations]{.underline}, coordinated through the Mons cyber operations
center and under the command of NATO's top general, the Supreme Allied
Commander Europe, or SACEUR. That could allow the top general to take
quick decisions on whether to use cyber weapons, similar to existing
agreements for NATO's air defenses and its ballistic missile shield,
where a commander has only minutes to decide what action to take. "From
my point of view, this is basically possible, but it has to be
arranged," Renner said.

### AI Thumper

#### 2021 AI strategy thumps.

C4ISRNET, where he covers military networks, cyber and IT, C4ISRNET,
"NATO launches AI initiative to nsure tech advantage,"
https://www.c4isrnet.com/artificial-intelligence/2022/05/18/nato-launches-ai-initiative-to-ensure-tech-advantage///ZW\]

WASHINGTON --- [Two NATO agencies recently kicked off an artificial
intelligence initiative to]{.underline} [better understand the
technology and its potential warfare applications]{.underline}. More
than 80 AI experts, researchers and academics from the U.S. and other
member countries are involved with the venture, known as a strategic
"horizon scanning," put together by the NATO Science and Technology
Organization and the NATO Communications and Information Agency. An
inaugural meeting and workshop was held this month in The Hague,
Netherlands, where the NCI Agency's data science and AI facilities are
located. "[AI is one of the key emerging and disruptive technologies
identified by NATO as vital for the maintenance of its technological
edge]{.underline}," NATO Chief Scientist Bryan Wells said in a
statement. "By working together, [the STO and the NCI Agency are able to
bring together global experts]{.underline} to ensure the very best
scientific expertise is available to advise NATO and its allies and
partners on the latest scientific trends in this area." The NATO
guarantee of a collective defense and the advantage of numbers, both on
the battlefield and in the lab, has been much discussed amid Russia's
latest invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent membership applications
made by Finland and Sweden. [NATO ministers in October adopted the
alliance's first-ever AI strategy]{.underline}, which describes the
capability as "changing the global defense and security environment" and
offering "an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen our technological
edge but will also escalate the speed of the threats we face." The
[strategy emphasizes responsible use of AI for defense]{.underline}
across six tenets: lawfulness; responsibility and accountability;
explainability and traceability; reliability; governability; and bias
mitigation. AI frameworks and other guidance drafted by the U.S. and its
defense community take a similar approach. NATO allies in 2019 agreed to
focus on seven emerging and disruptive technologies, data, computing and
AI among them. Making sure there are shared standards, and that systems
will work with systems, will be critical to success, officials said.
"[One of the big challenges]{.underline} when we go into this new phase
of disruptive technologies [is how do you keep all allies on the same
hymn sheet]{.underline} when it comes down to communicating with each
other, using the same technology, being interoperable," David van Weel,
NATO assistant secretary general for emerging security challenges, told
Defense News in March 2021. "[So that's a big part \[of the
strategy]{.underline}\] and a big role for NATO to play."

**Army Technology 04-08**-22 \[Army Technology, "Nato unveils imitative

https://www.army-technology.com/news/nato-initiative-new-technologies///ZW\]

Intergovernmental military alliance [Nato is set to launch a new
initiative that seeks to hone the military alliance's technological edge
over adversaries]{.underline}. This comes after the allied foreign
ministers [approved the charter of the Defence Innovation Accelerator
for the North Atlantic]{.underline} (DIANA). According to a Nato
statement, [DIANA will enable the defence personnel to work with the
alliance's scientific researchers, technology companies, and start-ups
to address critical defence and security challenges]{.underline}. The
participants will also gain access to a network of accelerator sites and
test centres located around member countries. Nato secretary general
Jens Stoltenberg said: "Working with the private sector and academia,
allies will ensure that we can harness the best of new technology for
transatlantic security." The leaders of the member countries have agreed
that DIANA would have two regional offices, one in Europe, and another
in North America. [The new initiative will focus on emerging and
disruptive technologies]{.underline} that are identified as priorities.
These technologies [include artificial intelligence]{.underline},
big-data processing, quantum-enabled technologies,
[biotechnology]{.underline}, autonomy, novel materials, [and
space]{.underline}. Several Nato allies have also agreed to establish a
multi-sovereign venture capital fund. This multinational Nato Innovation
Fund will invest up to €1bn (\$1.08bn) in early-stage start-ups, and
other deep tech funds, that are aligned with the military alliance's
strategic objectives. Last month, Nato opened the first Multinational
Ammunition Warehousing Initiative (MAWI) location, in Estonia. Other
allied members can use the facility to stock their ammunition, thereby
reducing logistical challenges.

## AT Europe

### AT: Nuclear umbrella-Britain

#### Britain is technically and politically dependent on the US for nuclear capabilities-they couldn't launch if they wanted to.

**Military Watch 21**(Military Watch Magazine, 9-9-21, \"Military Watch
Magazine,\"
https://militarywatchmagazine.com/article/is-the-united-kingdom-a-genuine-nuclear-power-a-look-at-the-british-nuclear-forces-unique-lack-of-independence)HS

The purpose of Britain\'s nuclear forces has continued to be questioned
to this day, particularly after [deep budget cuts under a stringent
austerity program affected almost all sectors of government
spending]{.underline} in the 2010s and [seriously undermined the armed
forces\' conventional capabilities]{.underline}. [According to a report
by the British Parliament\'s Select Committee on Defence in 2006,
Britain\'s nuclear submarines]{.underline} armed with Trident
intercontinental range ballistic missiles, which were [the only nuclear
force the country deployed, remained wholly dependent on the United
States to operate and did not represent any form of independence in
political or military decision making.]{.underline} The report stated:

\"[The fact that, in theory, the British Prime Minister could give the
order to fire Trident missiles without getting prior approval from the
White House has allowed the UK to maintain the facade of being a global
military power. In practice]{.underline}, though, [it is difficult to
conceive of **any situation** in which a Prime Minister would fire
Trident without prior U.S. approval]{.underline}. The USA would see such
an act as cutting across its self-declared prerogative as the world\'s
policeman, and would almost certainly make the UK pay a high price for
its presumption. [The fact that the UK is **completely technically
dependent** on the USA for the maintenance of the Trident system means
that one way the USA could show its displeasure would be to cut off the
technical support needed for the UK to continue to send Trident to
sea.\"]{.underline}

The report further noted regarding the lack of independence of
[Britain\'s nuclear forces - serving as an effective **appendage of
American nuclear forces**:]{.underline}

\"In a crisis the very existence of the UK Trident system might make it
difficult for a UK prime minister to refuse a request by the US
president to participate in an attack. The [UK Trident system is highly
dependent, and for some purposes completely dependent, on the larger US
system\...]{.underline} The UK\'s [dependency on the USA has operational
significance]{.underline}. For example, the [UK\'s reliance on U.S.
weather data and on navigational data provided by the U.S. Global
Positioning System (GPS) means that, should the USA decide not to supply
this data, the capacity of the UK\'s Trident missiles to hit targets
would be degraded.\"]{.underline}

[Ultimately Britain\'s nuclear arsenal remains the only one in the world
which is **unable to be utilised** independently without permission from
a foreign power]{.underline}. This is largely a result of the country\'s
original purpose for acquiring nuclear weapons - namely that because
their development was not a response to a critical national security
threat or a tool to assert independence within the Western Bloc they
could be made very dependant on the United States. Britain today
maintains a sizeable nuclear arsenal, which as of 2021 stands at 120
operationally available warheads and a further 95 in reserve - with
plans to increase the number operational . Of the available warheads
only 40 are deployed at a time, all from nuclear powered ballistic
missile submarines equipped with intercontinental range ballistic
missiles. [While no other state,]{.underline} be it Israel, Pakistan,
France or North Korea, [has ceded its ability to operate its nuclear
arsenal to another country, this is exactly what Britain has done which
represents a decision entirely unique among the world\'s nuclear
powers.]{.underline}

### AT: Nuclear Umbrella-France

#### French nuclear umbrella fails\-\--domestic politics, vulnerable to first strike, doesn't have tactical nukes.

**Kluth 22** Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering European politics,
former editor in chief of Handelsblatt Global and writer for the
Economist, Andreas(6-20-22, "Europe Needs a Better Nuclear Deterrent
Against Putin", Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/europe-needs-a-better-nuclear-deterrent-against-putin/2022/06/20/9f3c2e1c-f064-11ec-ac16-8fbf7194
cd78_story)HS

In one scenario, [France could extend its nuclear umbrella to the whole
European Union]{.underline} (of which the UK is no longer a member).
French President Emmanuel Macron speaks often about achieving European
"autonomy," by which he usually means independence from the US. So he
should in theory be amenable.

In practice, [the French are **neither willing nor able**]{.underline}.
Since Charles de Gaulle, France has [always insisted on **total
sovereignty** over its arsenal and all decisions pertaining to
it]{.underline}. In that sense, visions of a Europeanized "force de
frappe," as the French call their nukes, [suffer from the same problem
as ideas about a "European Army."]{.underline} Without a United States
of Europe[, it's not clear who'd be in command, when and
how.]{.underline}

Moreover, the [French arsenal isn't suited for the job. France has a
relatively small stash of 290 nukes. In the event of all-out war, an
adversary like Russia, with thousands of warheads, might be tempted ---
and able --- to take out those weapons with a preemptive first strike.
Deterrence only works if retaliation is assured]{.underline}.

[France's nukes are also of the wrong type. They're "strategic" --- that
is, bombs capable of causing many Hiroshimas worth of devastation each,
and therefore meant to be used only in a total-war scenario to take out
entire cities in the enemy's homeland.]{.underline}

[If Russia were to escalate]{.underline}, however, [it would do so with
"tactical" nuclear weapons --- smaller warheads deployed at short ranges
to cow an enemy into submission or win specific battles. It's
**inconceivable** that France (or anybody) would retaliate for an
initial and limited tactical strike by going directly to strategic
retaliation and thus Armageddon.]{.underline}

### AT: Turkey

#### They have it backwards\-\--Strong NATO suppresses Russian and Turkish aggression\-\--otherwise countless hotspots escalate

**Katz 15** \[Mark N. Katz, Professor of Govt & Politics at GMU, "Why
Russia Shouldn\'t Fear NATO," The National Interest, 2015,
[www.nationalinterest.org/feature/why-russia-shouldnt-fear-nato-13243](http://www.nationalinterest.org/feature/why-russia-shouldnt-fear-nato-13243)\]

[The corollary of Moscow belief that the expansion of NATO is a threat
to Russia is that the]{.underline} retraction,
**[incapacitation]{.underline}**, or dissolution [**of NATO** would make
Russia safer]{.underline}. Indeed, [Putin]{.underline}'s support for
anti-NATO and anti--EU political parties throughout Europe indicates
that he [does indeed aim at undermining these]{.underline} two
[institutions. Nor does Putin necessarily need to bring about their
**dissolution** in order to **undermine** them. Since NATO]{.underline}
and the EU both tend to [operate on the basis of consensus]{.underline},
the fact that the current political leaders of Hungary and Greece are
hostile to the existing European order and are quite friendly with
Moscow may go a long way toward furthering Putin's goal of rendering
NATO inoperable. And [if]{.underline} any more such leaders are elected
to power, [NATO]{.underline} might indeed [become unable to respond
effectively to actions taken by Putin to "protect" Russian
speakers]{.underline} elsewhere in Ukraine or even [in the Baltic
states]{.underline}. This clearly would not benefit the West. [But it
would not benefit Russia]{.underline} either. [For [the decline of NATO
is]{.mark} less [likely to lead to]{.mark} the unopposed rise of Russian
influence than to the **re-emergence of [conflicts that]{.mark} common
membership in [NATO has suppressed]{.mark}** or (**in the case of Greece
and Turkey) kept under control**. Putin has had relatively cooperative
relations with the often anti-Western Erdogan government in Turkey. He
also has good relations with Greece's new leftist
leadership]{.underline} that is [at odds with the EU. But
**[if]{.mark}**]{.underline} (whether as a result of Putin's actions or
not) [**[NATO becomes inoperable]{.mark}**, the **[Greek-Turkish
animosity]{.mark} that [NATO helped keep from escalating]{.mark}** after
Turkey's 1974 intervention in Cyprus might **soon
[re-emerge]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} And **[if it does, it is]{.mark} highly
[doubtful]{.mark} that [Russia will be able to calm it
down]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moscow may then be faced with the choice of
alienating one party because it sides with the other, or alienating both
because it sides with neither or (as Putin has attempted elsewhere)
tries to side with both simultaneously. [Despite Turkey's troubled
relations with the West recently, [Turkey may regard]{.mark} Russian
support for [Greece]{.mark} against it [as a]{.mark}n
**[existential]{.mark} [threat]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **thus go all out
to [support Chechen and]{.mark} other Muslim [opponents of Moscow's
rule]{.mark} in the North Caucasus and other Muslim regions of Russia**.
The [decline]{.mark} of NATO [might]{.mark} also **[embolden]{.mark} an
increasingly nationalist**]{.underline} and pro-Russian [[**Hungary**
to]{.mark} **revive its [claim to "lost
territories]{.mark}**]{.underline}." Moscow might not mind if Budapest
does this [with]{.underline} pro-Western [Ukraine or
Romania]{.underline} (with which Russia also has difficult relations),
but would not be pleased if Hungary sought the return of territory that
is now [[part of]{.underline}]{.mark} [pro-Russian [Serbia or
Slovakia]{.mark}]{.underline} (where Moscow has also sought to cultivate
illiberal tendencies). Another problem for Moscow is that for every
anti-Western government elected to office anywhere in Europe, one or
more of its neighbors are likely to feel threatened by it and so turn to
America for support. Further, while German public opinion may care
little about what Russia is doing in faraway Crimea or Eastern Ukraine,
[**[Berlin is likely to]{.mark} take more active measures** to
[thwart]{.mark} Moscow's efforts to expand [Russian influence]{.mark} in
countries closer to it. Finally, [the more]{.mark} that Western [states
see Russian actions as]{.mark} directly [harming their security]{.mark},
[the **more incentive they will** ]{.mark}**have [to respond by arming
Ukraine or others]{.mark}** [actively resisting Russia]{.mark}. In other
words, the **[decline of]{.mark} the pax Americana in Europe** resulting
from a weakened [NATO is]{.mark} less likely to be [replaced by]{.mark}
a pax Russica there, but by [a **chaotic situation**]{.mark}
**[in]{.mark} [Europe]{.mark}** [that **Russia will be unable to
control**]{.mark} or prevent from negatively impacting not just Russia's
external ambitions, but **its internal security as well**]{.underline}.
[Ironically, Russia could [**avoid all this** **if NATO remained strong
and intact**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Far from threatening Russia, [a
strong NATO has a **much greater incentive to act with self-restraint**
toward Russia **than individual countries** (both members and
non-members) being undermined by Russian actions]{.underline}. Indeed,
offering NATO membership to what remains of Ukraine may be the surest
means of inducing Kiev and the West as a whole to acquiesce to (though
not formally accept) the loss of Crimea and eastern Ukraine to Russia.
In other words, [Moscow is better off with a strong NATO that keeps
America in, Europe peaceful, and Russia by itself]{.underline} (if
that's what it wants) [than a weak NATO (or no NATO at all) [that keeps
America, Europe, and Russia]{.mark} **all [embroiled]{.mark} in needless
[conflic]{.mark}t**]{.underline} and tension.

Moreover, [one of [the]{.mark} most underappreciated [benefits of

### EU ARMY Impossible

#### Europe has literally forgotten how to run militaries, which ensures panicked scrambles and instability

**Rühle 16** \[Michael**,** M.A. Degree in Political Science from the
University of Bonn, Former Volkswagen-Fellow at the

and International Studies (CSIS), "Daydream Believers", Berlin Policy

https://berlinpolicyjournal.com/daydream-believers\]

Alas, such concentration is nowhere in sight. Quite the contrary.
Instead of reflection, some have chosen to panic: [[The vision
of]{.mark} a [Europe **unified**]{.mark} on]{.underline} security and
[defense has suddenly re-emerged. European nations -- some of which
aren't even close to]{.underline} the NATO-agreed goal of [spending two
percent]{.underline} of GDP on defense -- [are suddenly embracing bold
defense schemes]{.underline} that would involve spending far more than
they would ever be willing or even able to deliver. [But what a scheme
it is: A new, defense-minded Europe would finally be able to look after
its own backyard. Some]{.underline} observers have even [suggested that
a stronger Europe could keep an assertive Russia in check]{.underline}.
Take that, Donald!

[Sadly, the old continent [is]{.mark} merely **[shooting from the hip
replacement]{.mark}**. The reflex of [pushing **military**
initiatives]{.mark} in order [to jump-start]{.mark} a **stagnating
European [integration]{.mark} process** has **[never worked]{.mark}** in
the past, and it's **not likely to do so now**. [If]{.mark} the [EU
cannot]{.mark} make [progress on **far simpler** issues, it is]{.mark}
**even [less likely]{.mark}** to do so [in]{.mark} the area of
**security and [defense]{.mark}**[, where]{.mark} considerations of
**national [sovereignty]{.mark}** and [**status** (as well as
**defense-industrial protectionism**) run **deep**]{.mark}. For decades,
most EU aficionados have agreed that security and [defense can
**only**]{.mark} ever [be]{.mark} among [the]{.mark} **very [final
step]{.mark}**s of the European integration process. Trying [to
**reverse that sequence** in the face of]{.mark} US [disengagement will
**fail**]{.mark}, for a **variety of reasons**]{.underline}.

No "Strategic Culture"

First, [[there is no]{.mark} European [**"strategic culture,"**
and]{.mark} the [prospects]{.mark} of it emerging now [remain]{.mark} as
**[dim]{.mark} as ever**. [Europe remains a **conglomerate** of]{.mark}
nation states of [different **sizes**, **cultures**]{.mark}, historical
[**experiences** and]{.mark} geographic [outlooks. **"Brexit"**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} the return of [[**populism** are
**only**]{.mark} **the most visible [signs]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the
bloc's limitations: it has **[never]{.mark}** forged a [unified
vision]{.mark}]{.underline} of the continent's ultimate shape and
future. [US leadership in NATO ensured]{.underline} that [these
differences didn't matter]{.underline} much when it came to security and
defense. [[Exit the US]{.mark}, however, [and]{.mark} these
[differences]{.mark} will **[quickly come]{.mark} to the
[fore]{.mark}**. The [fear of being]{.mark} left [defenseless will
**not** force]{.mark} the **[Europe]{.mark}**ans **[toward]{.mark}**s
**more [unity]{.mark}** on security and defense, [but rather]{.mark} to
make [**separate deals** with the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates.

Second, military realities are conveniently ignored. Europe is capable
of smaller-scale military interventions along the continent's periphery,
but even the intervention in Libya in 2011 would not have been possible
without the US suppressing Libyan air defenses and supplying the
Europeans with ammunition (which they had run out of after just a few
days). In theory, Europe could buy everything it needs for such
operations. In practice, however, it won't. The bill for a genuine
satellite network, a fleet of transport aircraft, advanced cruise
missiles and more would force European nations to at least double their
defense budgets. Given the risks and costs of intervening without the
US, Europeans will be more hesitant than when they had Uncle Sam on
their team.

Third, the nuclear dimension remains conspicuously absent in the debate.
Many proponents of a stronger European effort in security and defense
are making the case for a conventional force strong enough to deter
Russia. But they seem to overlook that Russia is a nuclear power and can
therefore trump whatever conventional improvements the Europeans might
be able to muster. With the United Kingdom "Brexiting", the EU (unlike
NATO) cannot count on London's nuclear support. France would never let
an EU body decide over the "force de frappe." And EU members Austria and
Ireland have championed a global ban on nuclear weapons that is fiercely
opposed by the nuclear powers and other NATO members. In short, a
European nuclear deterrent is a myth; Europe's only credible nuclear
umbrella remains the one "made in the USA."

Fourth, the debate also ignores the [[**political** and **legal**
obstacles]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[stand in the way]{.mark} of a more
unified security and defense. [For example, the]{.mark} oft-repeated
**[arg]{.mark}**ument [that harmonizing]{.mark} armaments **planning**
and **[procurement]{.mark}** could [avoid]{.mark} wasteful
[**duplication** is]{.mark} as correct as it is **[irrelevant]{.mark}**.
The **[large]{.mark}**r European [nations **do not plan**]{.mark}
**their defense [in such a way]{.mark}**; when it comes to **key
military areas**, [they **don't want** to be **dependent** upon]{.mark}
the **agreement** of their **[small]{.mark}**er
[neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline}. On closer inspection, [**even seemingly
successful examples** of "streamlining" are the result of **budgetary
constraints**, not of **deliberate planning**. And [in several]{.mark}
EU member states, the **national [parliaments]{.mark}** [have a
**crucial say** in]{.mark} the **decision to employ military
[force]{.mark}** [-- a **privilege** they are **not likely to
surrender**]{.mark} to a collective EU body]{.underline}.

[Since]{.underline} Donald **[Trump]{.underline}**'s election in 2016,
[there has been a rising chorus among Europe's politicos that the
Continent can no longer rely on the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [for its defense]{.underline}. This narrative
had already begun to coalesce during the campaign, when European media
interpreted then-candidate Trump's calls for NATO countries to share
more defense costs as the beginning of the end for America's traditional
role as security provider and defender of human rights.
[[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} European commentators even [[questioned
whether]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the event of Trump's election, [the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[might]{.underline}]{.mark} simply [[walk away]{.mark} from NATO
altogether]{.underline}. Others sought to reassure themselves and their
increasingly unsettled publics that, while President Trump might indeed
be unpredictable, his cabinet would be staffed with consummate
professionals who understood the "bigger picture." So it came as perhaps
a bit of a shock when U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis, on his
first official visit to Europe in February 2017, delivered a stern
warning to the other 27 NATO members at a closed meeting in Brussels,
telling them that the Allies must either meet their financial pledges on
defense or America would "moderate" its commitment to the organization.
Since then, the [accusations of "Trumpian transactionalism" on defense
have]{.underline} only [gathered in speed, [alongside]{.mark} renewed
[talk of a **"European army,"**]{.mark}]{.underline} "European defense,"
and finally "strategic autonomy"---the latter presumably
[implying]{.underline} progressive [independence from the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [on security
issues]{.underline}.

Action followed words. In December 2017, the European Union launched the
so-called Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), with 25 EU members
promising to participate in a plan to develop and invest in shared
military capability projects. Augmented by the Coordinated Annual Review
on Defense (CARD) and the European Defense Fund (EDF), PESCO was
intended to focus on specific projects reportedly to avoid duplication
and to enhance their effectiveness. However, critics in the United
States charged that PESCO would at best have a marginal impact on
European military capabilities, lead to duplication and
non-interoperable systems within NATO, and was in reality intended to
lock out U.S. defense companies from bidding for European contracts.
Washington also conveyed the Trump Administration's concerns that rules
for the EDF would prevent companies based outside the European Union,
including U.S. defense contractors, from participating in the projects.
In short, though PESCO and the EDF were initially met by the Trump
Administration with cautious optimism and seen as potentially positive
steps to enhance European defense capabilities, both initiatives soon
became synonymous with protectionism and a diversion of Europe's scarce
defense resources in a direction that risked creating competition
between the EU and NATO.

There was more to come. In November 2018, French President Emmanuel
Macron called for the creation of a "true European army," an initiative
subsequently endorsed by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who called
for a European army to complement NATO. [[Soon]{.mark}, and]{.underline}
perhaps rather [[predictably]{.mark}, the idea [became
**muddled**]{.mark} by]{.underline} the [**semantics** of]{.underline}
the choice between [calling it a "European army" or an "army of
Europeans;" a year later the [conversation]{.mark}]{.underline} had
[[**devolved** into]{.mark} yet another European debate on "cooperative
security" that failed to acknowledge the **[persistent lack of political
will necessary]{.mark}** to make the dream a reality]{.underline}. In
fact, three years into the "we need to become independent on defense"
debate in Europe, [there is a real danger that a]{.underline} "common
[European army]{.underline}" of the sort advocated by some in Europe
[will do little more than **further polarize** the EU]{.underline}.
Indeed, the assumption that there would be such a thing as "European"
(as opposed to national) officers and soldiers is as dubious today as
the previous attempts to create similar forces, from the Western
European Union (WEU) through the Eurocorps and the Franco-German
brigade.

The European media and policy elite's continuing efforts to call into
question America's commitment to Transatlantic defense carries with it a
serious risk---one that goes beyond intra-European relations. The
anti-Trump sentiment pervasive among European policy elites has
increasingly aligned with anti-American strains of European public
opinion, to the detriment of the larger relationship. For instance,
according to a February 2019 Pew study, between 2013 and 2018, 30
percent more Germans stated that they viewed U.S. influence as a major
threat to their country, with increases of 29 percent in France, 25
percent in Spain, 15 percent in the UK, and 12 percent in Italy. Among
NATO countries only Poland saw a 5 percent decline. There is a danger
that the current round of posturing on European defense will feed into
the perception that, while allies refuse to meet their pledges on
defense spending (NATO's 2019 annual report showed that only seven of
the 29 allies met the 2 percent target), they nonetheless have the
resources to pursue their national defense industrial priorities. The
damage to already-strained U.S. relations with key allies in Europe,
especially Germany, may become enduring, bolstering the growing chorus
in Washington that what Europeans want is to continue to free-ride on
defense.

The larger problem is that the impasse in the current debate about
"European defense" is playing out against the backdrop of a rapidly
deteriorating security environment around Europe (and increasingly also
within), while the push for an autonomous European army seems
increasingly to be the result of ad hoc politics rather than a sound
defense calculus. Amidst the various acronyms and semantic exercises of
the past three years, what is missing in Europe today is a keen grasp of
history as well as strategic foresight. First, politicians seem to have
all but forgotten that [the **[Europe]{.mark}**an project [was
**possible**]{.mark} **to begin** with **precisely [because]{.mark}**
the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
[through]{.underline} the [NATO]{.underline} alliance, [[provided
the]{.mark} **overarching security [umbrella]{.mark}**]{.underline} for
the Continent, [**[defusing]{.mark} postwar [resentments]{.mark}** and
assisting in Europe's reconstruction]{.underline}. It bears remembering
that, [[without]{.mark} America's [commitment]{.mark} to Europe, the
**[Franco-German]{.mark} "grand [reconciliation"]{.mark}**
[would]{.mark} have **[take]{.mark}n much [longer]{.mark}** to attain,
if it were to be achieved at all]{.underline}. And so today, as during
the Cold War, it makes sense for European states to speak of "Europe"
when it comes to trade and economic policy integration. However,
[Europe's security has]{.underline} since 1945 [been a direct function
of]{.underline} its [having been embedded into the Transatlantic system,
and this **fundamental reality** **still remains true**
today]{.underline}. Simply put, there is a great deal of difference
between the notion of a protected "common market" linking the economies
of likeminded democratic governments, and that of Europe acting as a
unitary actor on security and defense.

And yet, [if]{.underline} a number of governments in [Europe
believes]{.underline}---as seems increasingly to be the case---that
[they can establish a "European" defense structure]{.underline} and a
"European security architecture," then [the [outcome will be a
**hollowing out** of NATO and]{.mark}]{.underline} at the very least [a
[**bifurcation** of Europe]{.mark}]{.underline} between the countries
facing Russia along the eastern flank and the those that during the Cold
War constituted Western Europe. [(**Even here**]{.underline} the
[divergent security optics]{.underline} are likely to [pull individual
countries in different directions, with]{.underline} countries like
[France looking south,]{.underline} and others, such as the
[Scandinavians, focusing on the north.) The **[end]{.mark}**game [will
**not** be]{.mark} a **["pan-European"]{.mark} security and
[defense]{.mark} system** [but]{.mark} rather a **[back to the
future]{.mark} scenario**: a **[new]{.mark} age of [insecurity]{.mark}
in Europe**, where deep power differentials]{.underline} among states on
the Continent will [yield a **hierarchy** of [national interests]{.mark}
that [will **quickly decompose**]{.mark} a larger sense of European
[solidarity]{.mark}. The countries in Central Europe]{.underline}, which
are deeply invested in the European Union as a pathway to economic
modernization, [will]{.underline} nonetheless [never wager]{.underline}
their [national survival on a pan-European defense and security
architecture, any more than]{.underline} powers in **[Western
Europe]{.underline}**an [will]{.underline} be able to [credibly
guarantee that]{.underline} in an extreme situation---[without America's
backing---they would be able to]{.underline} bring their societies to
the brink of war and beyond to [defend the Baltic States]{.underline},
Poland, or Romania.

**[Europe]{.underline}**'s political leaders seem to be losing sight of
the fact that, notwithstanding their differences with Washington, they
[do **not** have a **better security option** than working closely with
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and strengthening
NATO as the **centerpiece**]{.underline} of Europe's security and
defense policy. [In the current atmosphere, in which]{.underline}
criticizing the Trump Administration and [questioning the U.S.
commitment]{.underline} to its allies has become a
**[mantra]{.underline}** for European media, [the **situation on the
ground** tells a different story. A case in point: Next year Defender
2020 will be the U.S. Army's **largest exercise** in Europe in 25 years,
ranging across ten countries and involving 37,000 troops from at least
18 countries, of which 20,000 soldiers will be deployed from the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [to
Europe]{.underline}.

The impasse in the current debate about European security is driven by a
seeming unwillingness in key European capitals to realize the core
reality that, [**[without U.S.]{.mark} strategic [engagement]{.mark}, a
["European]{.mark} security [architecture" is a lark]{.mark}**. It is
time]{.underline} for Europe [to stop daydreaming about a "European
army"]{.underline} or an "army of Europeans," or whatever the latest
institutional permutation might be. Amidst a period of rapidly growing
state-on-state competition, it is high time to focus on the
fundamentals. [[If the common]{.mark} European [project is to
continue]{.mark}, the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [**[needs to stay]{.mark}** in Europe,
and **NATO needs to remain the centerpiece** of our mutual security and
defense]{.underline}.

It is worth remembering that, [regardless of occasional policy
differences, Europe]{.underline} today [has no better friend and no
stronger ally than the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
of America. This strategic reality should be the starting point of any
conversation in Europe's capitals about the Continent's security and
defense. However, if the current discussion about European defense as
autonomous, parallel, or even complementary to NATO continues on its
present course, it will cause lasting harm to Transatlantic relations,
with the much-vaunted "strategic autonomy" becoming, in an extreme case,
a self-fulfilling prophecy and, as such, Europe's undoing. [[If NATO
becomes dysfunctional]{.mark}, the **[Europe]{.mark}**an project
[will]{.mark} be reduced to **regional groupings**, **bilateral
alignments**, or it may **[fragment]{.mark} altogether**]{.underline}.

#### Litany of problems make EU Army impossible

**Waszczykowski 21** First Vice-Chair of the EU Parliament Committee on
Foreign Affairs and former Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Witold(12-13-21, An EU Army: competition with NATO or the right to
protection?, FES,
https://dc.fes.de/news-list/e/an-eu-army-competition-with-nato-or-the-right-to-protection)HS

The [EU arguably lacks determination, leadership and political will.
Some countries don't want to provoke Putin]{.underline}. Maybe it's too
late to save the EU, maybe it is better to start paying attention to
regional (perhaps even security) alliances with Ukraine and the Baltic
states?

This is a very long and complicated story which is called \"the prospect
of creating a defense identity of the EU\". Everything started at the
beginning of the 1990's, after the end of the Cold War. The EU started
discussing the possibility of a military force for mostly peacekeeping
operations, including monitoring missions in situations where NATO
troops -- with the participation of US troops -- are not able to
participate. After the Cold War ended, we expected more and more
problems related to the collapse of the Soviet Union. So we expected
that the presence of NATO troops ­-- and especially American troops --
would be unacceptable for Russia on the territories of the new
republics. That's why the idea was to create some kind of a European
defense or monitoring missions purely consisting of European forces. But
it never happened.

In 1992, we created the idea of Petersberg missions with humanitarian,
rescue, conflict prevention, and peace-keeping tasks. Then in 1996,
there was the idea of Berlin Plus - using NATO troops under the EU-led
Command. Then the CJTF \[Combined Joint Task Forces\] mechanism emerged
\[essentially, a deployable multinational task force generated and
tailored primarily for military operations not involving the defense of
the Alliance's territory, such as humanitarian relief and
peacekeeping\].

It has continued like this for almost 30 years. We may say that
something like \"[the defense identity of the EU\" is like a yeti:
everyone is talking about it, but no one has seen it.]{.underline} [20
years ago, we created battle groups. Every year there are at least two
to three units in the EU which are on the alert and ready to be used
somewhere. However, they have never been used because we do not have a
political mechanism how to decide who is supposed to use them and how to
use to.]{.underline} So this is the problem.

[Why do we still have no EU army?]{.underline}

First, because we have [no common definition of threats]{.underline}.
For countries like [Poland, we have different threats in mind than
countries like Portugal. If you do not have a common definition of
threats, you cannot create forces to challenge these
threats.]{.underline}

Second[, there is a problem of funding. In particular, Western countries
pay less and less for their military forces and the modernization of
their troops. They can't even fulfill obligations in NATO. If they
cannot do it in NATO, how can they find additional funding for creation
additional forces to be served for the EU?]{.underline} Moreover, the
next problem, I would say, is with the political military command. We do
not have a common foreign policy because we have to decide on the
foreign policy, especially security policy, by consensus, but not by the
majority voting. And we don't have a consensus on these issues.

Third, there is [a problem of headquarters.]{.underline} Who is going to
supervise and determine how to use these forces? Even if we create
groups of 5,000 or 50,000 troops, [who is going to command these forces
and decide where and how to use them; on which part of the border;
against whom]{.underline}? Against Lukashenko, or migrants who are
floating from Libya across the sea to Italy or Greece? So, there are a
number of issues. What is the relationship between an EU military and
NATO supposed to be? Are they supposed to cooperate, subordinate, or
engage each other in a complimentary manner? [The number of issues can
multiply these questions and answers.]{.underline} This is a problem.
Therefore, in order to have EU military forces, [we have to change
treaties and answer all the questions I have just mentioned in a new
treaty. But there is no political will inside the EU for a new
treaty.]{.underline}

### EU ARMY Impossible AT: Ukraine

#### Ukraine does nothing-EU ARMY IS A JOKE

Next, [Macron has hoped the Ukraine crisis would catalyse the EU into a

Europe. [He has called for a \"true, European army\" - as opposed to
Nato]{.underline} - and dreams of a time when there are no American
troops on European soil. This is Britain\'s nightmare, and Johnson has
instead been using the Ukraine crisis to bolster Nato.

[The problem for Macron is that]{.underline} Britain has been making
quite a bit of headway in selling the globalist vision of European
defence. [The EU already is a defence union]{.underline} (under Article
42.7 of the Lisbon Treaty) [which is fine in theory. In practice, it\'s

#### Ukraine generates NATO solidarity that overcomes conflicts

**Ridgwell 22** Europe Correspondent at Voice of America(Henry Ridgwell,
2-10-2022, \"As Support for NATO Grows, Has Putin Miscalculated Over
Ukraine?,\" VOA,
https://www.voanews.com/a/as-support-for-nato-grows-has-putin-miscalculated-over-ukraine-/6436837.html)HS

Visiting NATO headquarters Thursday, British Prime Minister
[Boris]{.underline} Johnson warned that Europe is facing its biggest
security crisis in decades and pledged [more military deployments in
eastern Europe]{.underline}, in response to Russia\'s troop buildup on
the border with Ukraine.

\"The stakes are very high, and this is a very dangerous moment. And at
stake are the rules that protect every nation, every nation big and
small,\" Johnson said after talks with NATO Secretary-General Jens
Stoltenberg.

Britain is strengthening its deployments in Estonia and Poland and is
considering further deployments in southeastern Europe in the event of a
Russian invasion of Ukraine.

[Several NATO members have sent troop reinforcements to
allies]{.underline} on NATO\'s eastern flank. Many observers say
[Moscow\'s actions have brought the alliance closer
together.]{.underline}

Stoltenberg welcomed Britain\'s commitment.

\"The U.K. is playing a leading role, delivering both militarily and
diplomatically,\" he said. \"Renewed [Russian aggression will lead to
more NATO presence, not less.\"]{.underline}

US carrier strike group

Warships and fighter jets from 28 NATO members conducted exercises off
the Italian coast earlier this month. It was the [first time since the
end of the Cold War that a U.S. Navy carrier strike group was placed
under NATO command.]{.underline}

The [United States has deployed an additional 3,000 troops to Poland and
Romania]{.underline}.

\"The focus of this particular mission \... is to reinforce the NATO
alliance, to build that trust and confidence, to reassure our allies and
to strengthen the eastern flank of the NATO alliance,\" Colonel Joe
Ewers of the U.S. Army 2nd Cavalry Regiment said Wednesday.

[France is preparing to send troops to Romania]{.underline}, while
[Germany]{.underline} - criticized in the past for failing to take a
harder line on Russia [- is boosting its troop deployment in
Lithuania]{.underline} by 350 personnel, in addition to the 500 soldiers
already there.

German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht called [Germany\'s
participation an important signal for NATO allies.]{.underline}

\"We can be relied on, and we are showing that with this strengthening
of the battle group,\" she told reporters on Monday.

NATO united

In 2017, then-U.S. President Donald Trump described NATO as \"obsolete\"
because, he said, it \"wasn\'t taking care of terror.\" In 2019, French
President Emmanuel Macron called the alliance \"brain dead,\" citing a
perceived waning commitment by its main guarantor, the United States.

Now, [Russia\'s actions have served to unify NATO]{.underline},
according to analyst Jonathan Eyal, associate director at the Royal
United Services Institute.

\"The Russians were demanding not merely an acceptance of a division of
Europe into new spheres of influence, but a rollback on all the security
arrangements put in place on the continent since the early 1990s at the
end of the Cold War. And that was simply so outrageous, so extreme in
its scope that quite frankly, it [left very little opportunity for
countries to disagree that a rejection and a flat-out rejection of such
demands was the only approach]{.underline}.\"

Eyal added that the [role of the United States has been
crucial]{.underline} in recent months.

\"It\'s astounding the amount of meetings, the amount of visits, the
amount of effort that the (U.S.) administration put into ensuring that
the consensus was kept,\" he said.

Public support

Opinion polls show an inc[rease in public support for NATO both in
existing member states and in non-NATO allies]{.underline}, including
Sweden and Finland. While neither is expected to join the alliance any
time soon, both countries have voiced alarm at the Russian troop
buildup.

\"Nobody wants this to escalate any further. We all want Russia to
de-escalate the situation. We want to find peaceful ways out of the
situation,\" Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin told reporters after
meeting European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last
week.

Putin\'s miscalculation?

Russia\'s amassing of more than 100,000 troops near the Ukraine border
was a miscalculation, Eyal said.

\"[If Russia was thinking of dividing Europe, what they\'ve done over
the past few months achieved precisely the opposite]{.underline},\" he
said.

But Russia believes it has achieved the objective of keeping Ukraine and
Georgia out of the alliance, said Alex Titov, a Russia analyst at
Queen\'s University Belfast.

\"Russia made it very clear, I think abundantly clear, that that is a
really big (red) line. As Putin said several times, membership of NATO
(for Ukraine and Georgia) would basically mean war with Russia for all
NATO countries.\"

Despite Moscow\'s denials, many Western leaders still believe Russia is
planning to invade Ukraine. Rather than highlighting NATO\'s divisions,
many observers say [that threat has galvanized the
alliance.]{.underline}

### AT: Sustainability\-\-- Turkey

#### Ukraine and strategic importance ensures Turkey strengthens ties with NATO

**Jovanovski 21** Reporter for NBC, BBC, CBC (Kristina Jovanovski,
4-15-21, \"Turkey supports Ukraine, NATO solidarity at Russia's
expense,\" The Jerusalem Post,
https://www.jpost.com/international/turkey-supports-ukraine-nato-solidarity-at-russias-expense-analysts-665246)HS

Russia\'s restrictions on flights to and from Turkey beginning on
Thursday will hurt Turkey\'s economy, but [Ankara has shown it is
prioritizing its relationship with NATO by supporting
Ukraine]{.underline} in its conflict with Russia, analysts told The
Media Line.

For more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org

Moscow has been reinforcing its troops on Ukraine\'s eastern border,
where pro-Russian separatists have been fighting Kyiv\'s military since
2014.

In his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Istanbul on
Saturday, [Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he supported
Ukraine\'s territorial integrity while Zelensky said their views on
regional threats coincided.]{.underline}

Timothy Ash, an economist with a focus on Turkey and Ukraine, said
[Erdogan\'s meeting with Zelensky will help to boost his relations with
US President Joe Biden.]{.underline} Ash expects a phone call will be
held soon between the two leaders, something the Turkish leader has
sought since Biden entered office in January.

\"[Erdogan has taken one on the chin]{.underline},\" Ash said. \"I think
[that will be understood in Washington]{.underline}.\"

Moscow announced on Monday that it would limit flights to Turkey until
June, two days after Erdogan met with and expressed support for his
Ukrainian counterpart.

The Kremlin denied the move to limit flights was connected to the
meeting and cited Turkey\'s increase in COVID-19 cases.

However, Ash told The Media Line, \"I think this decision was entirely
based on geopolitics and Putin\'s attempt to isolate Ukraine. Everything
Putin does is strategic.\"

While Erdogan has been trying to move Turkey closer to Russia, including
via an arms deal, the two governments have major differences.

For example, they are on opposing sides in Syria, with the Kremlin
supporting President Bashar Assad, including with air force units that
have caused the deaths of Turkish soldiers.

Soner Cagaptay, the author of \"Erdogan\'s Empire: Turkey and the
Politics of the Middle East,\" called the flight restrictions Russia\'s
\"warning shot\" and said Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon
place limits on agricultural imports from Turkey, subtracting a few more
percentage points from the country\'s economic growth.

The move also would subtract \"more than a few\" percentage points from
Erdogan\'s support base, he told The Media Line.

Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy, added that [Ankara is keen to work with
the US and expects the two sides to deepen ties, including on
Ukraine.]{.underline}

[Turkey\'s support for Ukraine goes beyond rhetoric. Ankara has provided
Kyiv with drones that helped the embattled country face separatist
forces accused of getting support from Russia.]{.underline}

Turkey is especially sensitive to flight restrictions, since a
significant portion of its GDP comes from tourism and Russia is its
largest source of foreign visitors.

Last year, more than 2 million Russians visited Turkey.

[Trade with Turkey\'s Western allies also plays a major role in the
country\'s economy]{.underline}, which had been struggling well before
the coronavirus pandemic.

Since the pandemic, tourism has seen a major drop and Turkey\'s
currency, the lira, recently fell even further after Erdogan removed the
country\'s respected central bank governor.

Erdogan knows well the possible fallout from citizens\' ailing finances,
as evidenced by his Justice and Development Party\'s loss in the 2019
Istanbul mayoral election, the greatest defeat for the president since
he came to power.

Analysts say [financial concerns and a sense of regional isolation now
has Erdogan on a charm offensive with Turkey\'s Western
allies.]{.underline}

After tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean led to fears of an
accidental clash with Greece, [Ankara restarted talks with
Athens.]{.underline} A meeting with the Greek foreign minister is
scheduled for Thursday.

But no ally is more important than the US.

The economic troubles that led to the Istanbul mayoral defeat were
sparked by a diplomatic row with Washington, which led to sanctions on
Turkey and a free fall of its currency.

On Saturday, [Turkey announced that two US warships would cross into the
Black Sea where Ukraine and Turkey have long coastlines, a high-profile
show of Ankara\'s support for NATO in the Ukraine conflict.]{.underline}

### AT: Sustainability\-\--Trump Doesn't Win

#### Trump's fear of losing prevents a 2024 bid

**Adams 6-2** Opinion Contributor for The Hill(Myra Adams, 6-2-2022,
\"Two words explain why Trump won't run in 2024,\" The Hill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3508270-two-words-explain-why-trump-wont-run-in-2024/)HS

Whenever two or more politically active people engage in conversation,
invariably someone asks, "Will Donald Trump run in 2024?"

My standard answer is always "I have no idea" --- until last week when
[Trump's much-ballyhooed vendetta campaigns to defeat Georgia Gov. Brian
Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger ended in embarrassing
anti-Trump failures.]{.underline}

[Reportedly, Trump was "stunned" by the results and headlines
such]{.underline} as The Washington Post's "Trump rebuked with stinging
losses in Georgia GOP contests." [But they're not surprising since the
former president's primary challengers]{.underline} --- former Sen.
David Perdue (R-Ga.) and Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.) --- were [Trump
stand-ins specifically chosen to promote the "Big Lie"]{.underline} ---
his perpetual mantra about the "stolen" 2020 election.

Trump's repudiation in Georgia has Republicans [speculating about his
declining kingmaking powers]{.underline}, openly defying him as he loses
his "vise-like grip on the party" and potentially endangering his
front-runner status. So, circling back to the most-asked question, my
new answer is "[Trump won't run in 2024"]{.underline} --- based on
personality traits rooted in the words "fear" and "fight."

We begin with "fear," [indirectly drilled into young Donald Trump's
psyche by Fred]{.underline}, his authoritarian father, who [demanded
that his son always win]{.underline} and show strength but never
weakness. Fred taught Donald that he could lie or twist the truth but
never back down. Consequently, [Trump developed an unnatural fear of
losing or being called "a loser."]{.underline}

Those grueling family dynamics were chronicled in Mary Trump's book "Too
Much and Never Enough," subtitled "How my family created the world's
most dangerous man." Donald Trump's niece is a Ph.D. clinical
psychologist whose best-seller was published in July 2020. Then, during
a television appearance on Dec. 3, 2020, Mary explained, "It's
impossible for Trump to believe that he lost the election."

That inability is why Trump can't let go of 2020 and will tease a 2024
run for as long as possible. But, ultimately, [Trump's fear of losing is
likely stronger than his willingness to take the risk]{.underline}.
Moreover, during a second reelection campaign, the former president
would be hard-pressed to use the same predictive excuse first heralded
in a May 25, 2020, Politico headline: "Trump sees a 'rigged election'
ahead. Democrats see a constitutional crisis in the making."

And again, on Aug. 17, 2020, a Hill headline quoted the president's
losing rationale: "Trump: 'The only way we're going to lose this
election is if the election is rigged.[\'"]{.underline}

Then, amazingly, on Tuesday, Trump activated his go-to playbook, writing
his followers, "ICYMI: 'Something Stinks In Georgia,'" explaining why
his nemesis, Gov. Brian Kemp, won 73.7 percent of the primary vote. Stay
tuned for that explosion.

Furthermore, Trump's fear of running and losing reelection a second time
is not assuaged by presidential history. In 1892, Grover Cleveland was
the first and only former president to win the office nonconsecutively.
But there is a striking political difference between Trump and
Cleveland's win-loss record.

Cleveland, a Democrat, was first elected in 1884 after winning the
popular vote and Electoral College. In his 1888 reelection defeat,
Cleveland lost the Electoral College but still won the popular vote.
Then in his second reelection campaign, Cleveland won the Electoral
College and the popular vote for the third time. By comparison, [Trump
has never won the popular vote --- a fact that must haunt his ego and
heighten his fear of 2024.]{.underline}

#### Trump won't get out of the primary\-\--National Republicans have coopted his platform and GOP voters reject Big Lie\-\--Georgia proves

**Willick 5-25** Washington Post columnist on legal issues, political
ideas and foreign affairs. (Jason Willick, 5-25-2022, \"Opinion,\"
Washington Post, <https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05>
/25/trump-2024-republican-primary-chances/)HS

[Donald Trump's]{.underline} critics are pointing to Tuesday's primary
results in Georgia, where his [favored statewide candidates were
routed]{.underline}, as evidence of the former president's waning
influence in the Republican Party. Yet Trump's supporters could just as
easily point to his backing of J.D. Vance, who came from behind to win
the Ohio GOP's Senate nomination, and Mehmet Oz, who is ahead by a hair
in Pennsylvania's Republican primary.

For those looking to assess Trump's potential strength in a 2024
presidential primary, [his 2022 endorsement scorecard surely has some
predictive value]{.underline}. But just as important is understanding
how the political game itself has changed in recent years. Even without
consulting polls or primaries, it's clear that the [internal Republican
Party conditions that enabled Trump's 2016 rise are no longer in
place.]{.underline}

Trump, [in his first run for president, saw a gap between the GOP
establishment and]{.underline} a critical mass of [voters]{.underline}
and rushed to fill it. After Mitt Romney's 2012 defeat, party leaders
resolved to move toward an immigration accommodation with Democrats, but
many GOP voters maintained restrictionist views. [Trump also exposed
dissatisfaction with the party's foreign policy]{.underline} under the
last Republican president, attacking George W. Bush's Iraq War without
being penalized by Republican primary voters. Finally, Trump offered a
more confrontational and ruthless approach to the culture war and to
press criticism than American politics had seen in decades.

These political and stylistic differences between Republican Party
custom and the preferences of its voters powered Trump's rise to party
leader. But [in the half decade since his election, the distance between
GOP elites and the conservative electorate has narrowed
substantially]{.underline} (for better and for worse). Some version of
[nationalistic and populist politics is now a condition of entry into
the Republican Party --- and certainly its 2024 presidential
primary]{.underline}. That was [emphatically not the case in
2016]{.underline}, when former Florida governor Jeb Bush kicked off the
race as the favorite.

In part [because of Trump's influence reshaping the GOP, his
distinctiveness within it is fading.]{.underline} This was evident in
the Georgia gubernatorial primary. [In the absence of a significant
philosophical or governing disagreement with incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp,
former senator David Perdue could distinguish himself only by his
adherence to the former president's narcissistic 2020 election vendetta.
Republican voters, who rejected Perdue by a 52-point margin, were not
impressed.]{.underline}

Richard Hofstadter, a mid-20th-century historian of American populism,
wrote that "third parties are like bees: once they have stung, they
die." The Trump movement in 2016 --- with its attacks on both party
establishments --- in many ways resembled a third party. If Trump has no
sting left, Hofstadter's analysis helps explain why.

"[Major parties have lived more for patronage than for
principles]{.underline}," Hofstadter explained. They are [risk-averse
organizations designed for stable governance. Populists and third
parties, meanwhile, are not geared to govern, but to "agitate, educate
\... and supply the dynamic element in our political life]{.underline}."
These two forces --- steady and disruptive --- influence one another, so
that [when "a third party's demands become popular enough, they are
appropriated by one or both of the major parties and the third party
disappears."]{.underline}

That [process could already be reducing the demand for
Trump]{.underline} as a political figure. [His approaches]{.underline}
to foreign policy, immigration and the culture wars have been at least
partly [appropriated by most national GOP politicians. Even]{.underline}
Virginia Gov. Glenn [Youngkin, a purple-state Republican with suburban
appeal, ran aggressively and unapologetically against the cultural left
in 2021. By contrast, the Georgia primaries show that Trump has been
unable to entrench his myths about the 2020 election --- which are
rejected by the electorate at large --- within the GOP.]{.underline}

[Winning a competitive 2024 primary would take a kind of political
entrepreneurship beyond what Trump has exhibited]{.underline} so far. In
a GOP field geared toward the preferences of populist voters[, Trump
would struggle more than in 2016 to find a politically underserved
constituency]{.underline} --- [and his efforts to do so could lead him
further into the conspiracy fever swamps, which would fragment his
support]{.underline}.

Then there are the attacks that would come flying from new directions if
Trump's opponents played for keeps. Florida Gov. Ron [DeSantis could
outflank Trump on pandemic policies, pointing out that his state
resisted shutdowns that the Trump administration recommended in
2020]{.underline}. Competitors could also charge that Trump shares blame
with President Biden for inflation, for both picking Jerome H. Powell as
chairman of the Federal Reserve and supporting massive spending during
the pandemic.

When it comes to the ability to insult, shock and polarize, Trump likely
can't be matched in a GOP primary. But the [Georgia results show that
Republican voters won't simply follow his orders]{.underline} by
default. If Trump runs in 2024, he'd be squaring off against a major
party remade in his movement's own image. That's a testament to Trump's
success as a third-party-style political entrepreneur --- but it might
also blunt the force of his appeal as a major party leader.

## AT RCA Turn

### Assurances Turn\-\--2AC 

#### Withdrawal causes allied [mistrust]{.underline}\-\--[global proliferation]{.underline} AND [extinction]{.underline}. 

David **Axe 18**, Aerospace and Defense Fellow at Forbes, 7-16-2018,
\"The Risk to the World: Massive Nuclear Proliferation,\"
https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-risk-to-the-world-massive-nuclear-proliferation,
jy

[If Trump]{.underline} actually [did withdraw, Europe would
become]{.underline} right away [**much more vulnerable** to Russian
**nuclear attack**]{.underline} or, more likely, intimidation. But
immediate nuclear fire isn\'t the only danger.

More realistically, the [Americans leaving NATO would force European
countries that currently lack nuclear arms to toss aside the 1968
Non-Proliferation Treaty and **rush to acquire them**]{.underline}, all
in order [to **deter the Russians**]{.underline} without the Americans\'
help.

[The treaty\'s disintegration could]{.underline} then [lead to countries
**all over the world pursuing their own nukes**]{.underline}. \"Trump is
[increasing the chances of the **bomb spreading** and the key treaty
keeping the lid on such proliferation **collapsing**]{.underline},\"
says Blair.

[Unconstrained nuclearization is one **nightmare scenario**]{.underline}
that is becoming increasingly plausible as Trump escalates his criticism
of the 69-year-old North Atlantic alliance. For three quarters of a
century, American nukes have made it unnecessary for many European
countries to possess nukes of their own.

Because of that, these countries could safely sign on to the
Non-Proliferation Treaty, bolstering international efforts to limit
nuclearization all over the world. \"Among the benefits of NATO, a key
one is that it has helped to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons,\"
Kingston Reif, an analyst with the Arms Control Association, told The
Daily Beast.

But that was long before Trump's rise as a political force. In 2017, the
former reality-T.V. star declared NATO \"obsolete.\" In Brussels on July
11, Trump again questioned the organization\'s usefulness. \"What good
is NATO?\" he asked. The next day at a meeting of NATO leaders, Trump
threatened that he might \"do his own thing\" if alliance members
didn\'t immediately increase their military spending.

Trump\'s words sent a chill through European capitals. The United States
is by far the biggest military spender in NATO and, according to Mark
Simakovsky, a fellow with the Atlantic Council\'s Eurasia Center, the
\"glue\" that holds the alliance together. \"Don\'t forget, there are
huge divisions in Europe,\" Simakovsky said.

NATO\'s 29 member states range from illiberal Turkey, Hungary and Poland
on the alliance\'s eastern flank to stalwarts France and Germany at the
heart of the continent and the restive United Kingdom in the west.

At present just two non-U.S. NATO states -- the U.K. and France --
possess nuclear weapons. France fields around 300 nukes. The U.K.,
around 215. By contrast, the United States maintains an arsenal of no
fewer than 3,800 atomic warheads, only slightly fewer than Russia
possesses. The U.S. military keeps 180 warheads in Europe for use by its
own forces and the forces of certain NATO members, most notably Germany.

Practically speaking, [America is **Europe\'s nuclear
shield**]{.underline}.

Under [Article V]{.underline} of the NATO charter, an attack on any NATO
state represents an attack on every other state -- and the alliance is
obligated to respond. That applies to a nuclear strike as well as
conventional attack. If Russia nuked, say, Lithuania or Poland, the
United States would be obligated to nuke Russia right back.

That mutual nuclear threat [has helped to **keep the peace in
Europe**]{.underline} since the Soviet Union exploded its first atomic
bomb in a test in 1949, the same year as NATO\'s founding.

[But with France and the U.K. possessing **so few atomic warheads
compared to Russia**, deterrence]{.underline} in Europe [could **begin
to collapse without American nukes**]{.underline}. And
[that]{.underline} risk [could drive European countries to **create
their own**,]{.underline} more powerful deterrents -- either
collectively or individually.

\"The loss of U.S. reliability to deter aggression against NATO Europe
[would prompt France and the U.K. to **expand their nuclear
capabilities**]{.underline} [and Germany and other non-nuclear countries
to consider building their own]{.underline} nuclear [arsenals **despite
strong public opposition**]{.underline},\" Blair said.

Some European officials are already thinking in those terms. In 2017,
Jaroslaw [Kaczynski]{.underline}, chairman of Poland's ruling Law and
Justice Party, [called for Europe to build up a **combined nuclear
arsenal**]{.underline} as powerful as Russia\'s own arsenal.
Conservative German parliamentarian Roderich Kiesewetter endorsed the
idea.

If the United States were to leave NATO, [Europe could **build its own
deterrent**]{.underline} under the umbrella of a diminished NATO
structure, [or opt for a new structure based on the European
Union]{.underline}. In the last decade or so, [the E.U. has begun to
establish a rudimentary military organization]{.underline}, but has
deployed troops only rarely -- and then mostly in Africa on peacekeeping
duties.

The realignment could get complicated. Albania, Canada, Iceland, Norway
and Turkey are in NATO, but aren\'t in the E.U. Austria, Finland,
Ireland, Malta and Sweden are in the E.U., but aren\'t in NATO. Ireland,
for one, is strictly opposed to nuclear weapons. \"There are European
Union members with nuclear capabilities, but how those capabilities
would be employed outside of a NATO context -- it\'s never been fleshed
out,\" Simakovsky said.

For Trump [to even threaten to pull back America\'s atomic umbrella is
dangerous]{.underline}, Simakovsky said. \"[What it encourages is
**instability**.\"]{.underline}

And [that instability -- and the resulting **mistrust between former
allies**]{.underline} [-- plays into the hands of]{.underline} Russian
president Vladimir [Putin. It could]{.underline} even, in the most
extreme scenario, [tempt Putin to launch his **own limited nuclear
strike**]{.underline} in the context of a wider war in Europe.

In the last decade Russia has invaded two of its European neighbors --
Ukraine in 2014 and the Republic of Georgia in 2008. Neither Georgia nor
Ukraine is a full member of NATO, although both countries have signalled
their desire to join the alliance.

The Eastern European states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia -- all
former Soviet republics -- and Poland, formerly a Soviet satellite, are
NATO members and view themselves as the main targets of Russia\'s
aggression. This year, Russia deployed nuclear weapons to Kaliningrad, a
Russian enclave on the Baltic Sea between Poland and Lithuania.

The Trump administration criticized the Russian deployment as
\"destabilizing.\" But [the **greater threat**]{.underline} of
destabilization [comes from the administration itself as it continues to
dismantle]{.underline} rhetorically [a security structure that has
**preserved the** peace -- and **deterred nuclear war**]{.underline} --
in Europe since 1949.

\"If Putin somehow decides to cross the nuclear threshold, it won't be
because he thinks we don't have enough nuclear weapons,\" Reif said.
\"It will be based on a political calculation that he has a greater
stake in the conflict and we and our allies won't be willing to run the
risk of escalation.\"

The alternative is only less awful. That, in the absence of America\'s
nuclear guarantee as part of a transatlantic alliance, Europe might
build up a large nuclear arsenal of its own and supercharge global
atomic proliferation. \"[Nothing would do more to cause **nuclear
anarchy** than wrecking NATO]{.underline},\" Blair said.

The Costs of Nuclear Proliferation

**[General empirical findings]{.underline}** thus [lend **support** to
the proposition]{.underline} that [security alliances impede **nuclear
proliferation**]{.underline}. But is this a net contributor to global
security? Most practitioners and policy analysts would probably not even
bring this up as a question and would automatically answer yes if it
were raised. Yet a small but very prominent group of theorists within
the academy reach a different answer: some of the same realist precepts
that generate the theoretical prediction that retrenchment would
increase demand for nuclear weapons also suggest that proliferation
might increase security such that the net effect of retrenchment could
be neutral. Most notably, "nuclear optimists" like Kenneth Waltz contend
that deterrence essentially solves the security problem for all
nuclear-armed states, largely eliminating the direct use of force among
them.21 It follows that US retrenchment might generate an initial
decrease in security followed by an increase as insecure states acquire
nuclear capabilities, ultimately leaving no net effect on international
security.

This perspective is countered by "[nuclear pessimists]{.underline}" such
as Scott Sagan. [Reaching]{.underline} outside realism to organization
theory and other bodies of social science research, they [see **major
security downsides** from new nuclear states. **Copious
research**]{.underline} produced by Sagan and others [casts **doubt** on
the expectation]{.underline} that [governments can be relied upon to
create **secure and controlled nuclear forces**]{.underline}.22 [[The
more nu]{.mark}clear [states]{.mark} there are, **the [higher]{.mark}
the [probability]{.mark}** that **the organizational**,
**psychological**, and **civil-military [pathologies]{.mark}** Sagan
identifies will [turn]{.mark} an episode like **one of the numerous
"near [misses]{.mark}"** he uncovers into **actual [nuclear]{.mark}
use**]{.underline}. As Campbell Craig warns, ["One day **a
[warning]{.mark} system** [will **fail**]{.mark}]{.underline}, or [[an
official will **panic**]{.underline}]{.mark}, or [**a [terrorist]{.mark}
attack** will be **[misconstrued]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [the
[missiles]{.mark} will **[fly]{.mark}**."]{.underline}23

Looking beyond these kinds of factors, it is notable that powerful
reasons to question the assessment of proliferation optimists also
emerge even if one assumes, as they do, that states are rational and
seek only to maximize their security. First, nuclear deterrence can only
work by raising the risk of nuclear war. For deterrence to be credible,
there has to be a nonzero chance of nuclear use.24 If nuclear use is
impossible, deterrence cannot be credible. It follows that every nuclear
deterrence relationship depends on some probability of nuclear use. The
more such relationships there are, the greater the risk of nuclear war.i
[[Prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline} therefore [**[increases]{.mark}**
the chances of [nuc]{.mark}lear [war]{.mark} even [in **a**]{.mark}
**perfectly [rational]{.mark}ist [world]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Proliferation optimists cannot logically deny that nuclear spread
increases the risk of nuclear war. Their argument must be that the
security gains of nuclear spread outweigh this enhanced risk.

Footnote i begins:

i\. If proliferation strictly substitutes for US nuclear guarantees
(that is, the only states that proliferate are those with US nuclear
guarantees), then the net number of nuclear deterrence relationships
stays constant. But as we argue later, [proliferation to **current US
allies** is likely to generate **further spread** to states **not
currently allied** with Washington]{.underline}. And there are strong
reasons to expect it to be harder to build robust low-risk postures in
the case of many potential proliferators.

Footnote i ends and the article continues:

Estimating that risk is not simply a matter of pondering the conditions
under which leaders will choose to unleash nuclear war. Rather, as
Schelling established, the question is whether states will run the risk
of using nuclear weapons. Nuclear crisis bargaining is about a
"competition in risk taking."25 [Kroenig counts **some twenty cases** in
which states---including]{.underline} prominently [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates---[ran **real risks** of
nuclear war]{.underline} in order [to prevail in crises]{.underline}.26
As Kroenig notes, "By asking whether states can be deterred or not ...
proliferation optimists are asking the wrong question. The right
question to ask is: what risk of nuclear war is a specific state willing
to run against a particular opponent in a given crisis?"27 The more
nuclear-armed states there are, the more the opportunities for such
risk-taking and the greater the probability of nuclear use.

It is also the case that for nuclear weapons to deter a given level of
conflict, there must be a real probability of their use at that level of
conflict. For nuclear weapons to deter conventional attack, they must be
configured in such a way as to make their use credible in response to a
conventional attack. Highly controlled and reliable assured-retaliation
postures might well be credible in response to a conventional attack
that threatens a state's existence. But as newer research shows, the
farther the issue in question is from a state's existential security,
the harder it is to make nuclear threats credible with the type of
ideally stable nuclear posture whose existence proliferation optimism
presupposes.28 If [[a state]{.underline}]{.mark} wishes, for example, to
deter a conventionally stronger neighbor from seizing a disputed piece
of territory, it may face great challenges fashioning a nuclear force
that is credible. Following Schelling's logic about the "threat that
leaves something to chance," it [[may]{.mark} face incentives to [create
**a**]{.mark} **quasi-[doomsday]{.mark} nuclear [posture]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark} **virtually [locks in]{.mark}** [escalation]{.mark} in
response to its rival's attempt to seize **the territory
conventionally**]{.underline}.

Key here is that nuclear spread cannot be treated as binary: "You have
'em or you don't." States can choose the kind of nuclear postures they
build. Some [[states]{.mark} may choose to [build **dangerous**]{.mark}
and **[vulnerable]{.mark} nuclear [postures]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And
[[because they lack]{.mark} **the [money]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} **the
technological [capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline} or both, [many states may
not be able to create **truly survivable forces**]{.underline} (that is,
forces that can survive a nuclear first strike by a rival power) [even
if they wanted to]{.underline}.

The links between nuclear possession and conflict are hard to assess
empirically. Still, there are relevant findings that are probative for
this debate:

• Nuclear weapons are most credible at deterring the kind of conflict---
threats to a state's core territorial security---that is least relevant
to the actual security concerns of most states most of the time. Both
quantitative and case study research validates the claim that
territorial conquest is rarely an issue in armed conflicts in the
present era. Yet states that are bullish on their prospects for
territorial survival as sovereign units still have plenty of security
concerns and also often find plenty of reasons to use force and plenty
of ways to use force other than by conquering other states.29

• Robust, secure nuclear postures do not stop states from engaging in
intense security competition. Though the United States and Soviet Union
did not fight each other during the Cold War, their nuclear arsenals did
not prevent them from engaging in one of history's most costly
rivalries, complete with intense arms racing and dangerous crises that
raised the specter of nuclear war.

• Though they built massive arsenals, at various junctures the two
superpowers adopted dangerously escalatory postures to attempt to deter
various levels of conflict.30

• [**The mere [possession]{.mark}** [of nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s does
not deter]{.mark} **conventional [attack]{.mark}**[,
as]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[India and Israel
discovered]{.underline}]{.mark}.

• In both statistical and case study tests, Vipin Narang finds that the
only nuclear posture that has any effect on conventional conflict
initiation and escalation is a destabilizing "asymmetrical escalatory"
force, a doomsday posture designed to create intense incentives for
early use, such as that constructed by Pakistan in the 1990s.31

In short, **[nuclear spread]{.underline}** is a Hobson's choice: it
[will **inevitably increase** the chances of **nuclear
use**]{.underline}, and it will either not deter conventional war or
will do so only by raising the risks of nuclear war even more. Add to
this the risk that [states in **the real world** may not behave in ways
**consistent** with the assumptions underlying proliferation
optimism]{.underline}. That is, [**some subset** of **[new]{.mark}
nuclear-armed [states]{.mark}** [may not be]{.mark} led by
**[rational]{.mark} leaders**, may not prove able to overcome
**organizational problems** and resist the **temptation to
[preempt]{.mark}** [before]{.mark} feared [neighbors nuclearize, may not
pursue security]{.mark} as **the only major state preference**, [and may
not be **risk-averse**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The scale of these risks
rises as the world moves from nine to twenty, thirty, or forty nuclear
states. In addition, many of the other dangers noted by analysts who are
concerned about [**the destabilizing effects of nuclear
proliferation**---including]{.underline} [**the risk of accidents** and
the prospects that **some [new]{.mark} nuclear [powers]{.mark}** [will
not have]{.mark} **truly [survivable forces]{.mark}** (making them
susceptible to **a first-strike attack** and]{.underline} thus [creating
incentives for **early first use**)---are prone to go up as the number
of nuclear powers grows]{.underline}. Moreover, the risk of unforeseen
crisis dynamics that could spin out of control is also higher as the
number of nuclear powers increases. Finally, [[add]{.underline}]{.mark}
to these concerns the [**enhanced danger** of **nuclear
[leakage]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **dangerous, undeterrable [nonstate
actors]{.mark}**, and a world with **overall higher levels** of
**security competition**]{.underline} becomes yet more worrisome. And
all of these concerns emerge independently of other reasons the United
States is generally better off in a world with fewer nuclear states,
notably increased US freedom of action.

constitution spells out modern Russia's imperial ambitions," *Atlantic
Council*,
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/putins-new-constitution-spells-out-modern-russias-imperial-ambitions/>)

[The **[constitutional amendments]{.mark}** adopted by Russia in summer
2020 [have]{.mark} **[far-reaching implications]{.mark}**
for]{.underline} the Russian population, but the potential repercussions
are also [[causing]{.mark} **considerable [unease]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}
Ukraine and other [post-Soviet countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is
hardly surprising. [The revised Russian Constitution seeks to place the
Kremlin's **interventionist** policies towards the nations of the former
Soviet empire on a **new legal footing**]{.underline}. Officials in
Kyiv, Tbilisi, and Chisinau are already confronted by the reality of
partial Russian occupations in their countries. They now fear that [new
constitutional [amendments]{.mark} will be used to **[justify]{.mark}**
[future acts]{.mark} [of]{.mark} **[aggression]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

When Russians went to the polls on July 1 to vote for [a package of
constitutional reforms]{.underline}, coverage focused on the amendments
that would allow Vladimir Putin to reset his term limits and remain in
office until 2036. Most observers agreed that this was the true
objective of the exercise, with additional changes serving as mere
window dressing to disguise what was effectively a constitutional coup.

It is hard to argue with such conclusions. Proposed populist revisions
such as a ban on same-sex marriage and protection for Kremlin-approved
versions of history clearly pandered to nationalist sentiment and were
used to drum up public support for the new-look constitution. However,
the package also [contained]{.underline} some far more [substantial
amendments with particularly ominous implications for Putin's
future]{.underline} domestic and [foreign policies]{.underline}.

[The new constitution strengthens the Kremlin's grip on the Russian
elite]{.underline}, making it possible to exclude people from office for
such offenses as holding dual citizenship, foreign residency, or
overseas bank accounts. Candidates for the Russian presidency are
required to have lived in Russia continuously for 25 years, which rules
out anyone with a Western education or significant international work
experience.

Meanwhile, [the **[authority]{.mark}** [of the presidency has
been]{.mark} **considerably [enhanced]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While
Putin has informally reigned supreme for many years, the new
constitution consolidates this reality around a tightly controlled
bureaucracy, increasingly centralized authority, and veto powers over
parliament via the Constitutional Court, which is informally controlled
by the executive.

[The reset of Putin's system also appears to confirm Moscow's aggressive
foreign policy towards]{.underline} the [former Soviet
republics]{.underline}, above all in terms of the ongoing
Russian-Ukrainian conflict. [Since]{.underline} launching its military
intervention against [Ukraine]{.underline} in early 2014, [the Kremlin
has **repeatedly demonstrated** a readiness to break international
law]{.underline}. Nevertheless, throughout the six-year campaign,
[Moscow has continued to **pay lip service** to global security rules
and regulations]{.underline}. [The new-look constitution means this is
no longer]{.underline} strictly [necessary]{.underline}. Instead, [[it
confirms]{.mark} the **[primacy]{.mark}** [of Russian law over]{.mark}
any [obligations]{.mark} stemming [from]{.mark} Russia's membership in
[international organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}. The new constitution
clearly states: "Decisions of interstate bodies adopted on the basis of
provisions of international treaties of the Russian Federation in their
interpretation, that contradicts the Constitution of the Russian
Federation, are not subject to execution in the Russian Federation." In
other words, **[Russian law comes first]{.underline}**.

[The most alarming [amendment]{.mark} is probably the section which
[elaborates on Moscow's right to]{.mark} **[intervene
internationally]{.mark}** [in defense of]{.mark} loosely defined
[compatriots]{.mark}]{.underline}. "The Russian Federation provides
support to compatriots living abroad in exercising their rights,
ensuring the protection of their interests, and preserving their shared
Russian cultural identity," it states.

[This new provision creates an explicit constitutional basis for the
Kremlin's aggressive actions against Ukraine and other countries of the
former Soviet Union]{.underline} which are home to large ethnic Russian
populations. Indeed, by making broad references to "Russian cultural
identity", [Moscow leaves considerable room for interpretation over
exactly when and where it believes it can intervene]{.underline}.
Ultimately, [it is left to the Kremlin itself to determine the
boundaries of the "Russian World]{.underline}."

One of the most obvious applications of this constitutionally enshrined
right [to "provide support" would be in defense of Russian passport
holders]{.underline} living elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. In
recent years, Russia has introduced a series of measures designed to
increase the number of Russian passports issued to ex-Soviet citizens.
This tactic [has helped to justify Russian intervention in a number of
former Soviet republics]{.underline} and is currently being used in
eastern Ukraine to strengthen the Kremlin's grip on the Russian-occupied
parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. [Taken together, [Russia's new
constitution and]{.mark} efforts to create **[passport
protectorates]{.mark}** throughout the former USSR will potentially
[enable Moscow to]{.mark} **[restrict]{.mark}** the
**[sovereignty]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} all the [nations within]{.mark} the
Kremlin's traditional [sphere of influence]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Finally, [Article 67]{.underline} of Russia's new constitution is of
special interest to Ukraine. This clause [outlaws any discussion of
returning Russian lands to foreign powers]{.underline} and appears to
have been included specifically with Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in
mind. Russia has occupied Crimea since February 2014, when Russian
troops took advantage of political paralysis in post-revolutionary Kyiv
to launch a lightning takeover of the peninsula. By cementing Crimea's
status in the Russian Constitution, Putin clearly hopes to prevent any
successors from ever revisiting the issue. This represents a huge
obstacle to the future normalization of relations between Moscow and
Kyiv.

[Putin's [new Russian Constitution]{.mark} is clearly a worrisome
development for countries like Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and now also
Belarus]{.underline}. [It confirms Russia's transition towards
authoritarianism and **[codifies]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
**[[revisionist imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark}** that has been setting
the Putin regime's foreign policy agenda for much of the past two
decades.

[This should **serve as a reality check** for members of the
international community who still believe in the possibility of
pragmatic compromises with the Kremlin]{.underline}. For the countries
of the former USSR, [[the]{.mark} **[message]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} even
**[clearer]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [[Russia intends to]{.mark}
**[reassert]{.mark}** its **[dominance]{.mark}** over the post-Soviet
world]{.underline} and will continue to do so for as long as Putin
remains in power.

This aggressive foreign policy doctrine is taking shape against a
backdrop of mounting economic stagnation and political oppression inside
Russia itself. Indeed, Putin's increasingly insecure domestic position
was a key factor behind the decision to preempt speculation over a
possible political transition by extending his reign until 2036 via the
recent constitutional vote.

In such circumstances, [fresh foreign policy adventures in the
post-Soviet region may serve as a convenient way of refocusing Russian
public attention]{.underline}. At present, the Kremlin is occupied with
the crisis in Belarus. Meanwhile, the bloody stalemate in eastern
Ukraine rumbles on. Putin's new constitution indicates that such
entanglements will only increase in the years ahead.

[Russia's constitutional amendments offer little cause for
optimism]{.underline}. On the contrary, [aggressive Kremlin policies in
the post-Soviet space are likely to remain a key challenge to
international security throughout the coming decade]{.underline}. So
far, the Western response to this challenge has been inadequate. [Now
that Putin has **spelled out his intentions**, there is **no excuse**
for failing to grasp the nature of the threat his regime
poses]{.underline}.

#### NATO's key to [deterrence]{.underline}. 

Michael **Peck 19**, defense writer and contributor to Forbes,

What would happen [if the United States **left NATO**]{.underline}?

The International Institute of Strategic Studies examined several
scenarios in which [NATO]{.underline} (including Canada) had to
[confront Russia **without U.S. support**]{.underline}.

In one scenario set in 2021, [Russia occupies **Lithuania** as well as
**Polish territory**]{.underline} bordering Kaliningrad. With Lithuania
and Poland as NATO members, [NATO **invokes Article 5**]{.underline},
which treats an attack on one member as an attack on all members. It
prepares a military force---minus U.S. troops and support---to compel
Russia to withdraw from the occupied territories.

But [the NATO offensive]{.underline}---code-named Operation Eastern
Shield/Eastern Storm---[would face **major problems**]{.underline}. Put
simply, [NATO **couldn't muster that much force**, or]{.underline}
adequately [support the force]{.underline} it could muster.

Currently, NATO has a division-sized NATO Response Force, and there are
plans to add enough battalions to create a corps-sized force. However,
"[neither of these structures would therefore prove sufficient to
generate the force size required in this scenario]{.underline}," the
study concludes.

For example, [to meet Russian forces]{.underline} well-endowed with
tanks, [NATO's intervention force would need to be mostly composed of
heavy brigades]{.underline} with modern tanks and infantry fighting
vehicles. And to achieve a 2:1 force ratio sufficient to defeat the
Russians, [four corps would be needed]{.underline}.

Yet in the Baltic invasion scenario, [without U.S. troops]{.underline}
and assuming the Polish army has already suffered heavy losses, "[the
remaining European members of NATO and Canada currently only have around
20 brigades]{.underline} that would meet these criteria," the
International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) estimated.

About one-third of this total comprises formations primarily equipped
with lighter, wheeled, armored vehicles. Assuming that, on average, 50
percent of these formations would be able to deploy within the 90 days
given, the overall force available to [NATO would be equivalent only to
a **single corps**]{.underline}. In a similar vein, [there are currently
**insufficient numbers of modern artillery**, particularly long-range
systems]{.underline}. A significant increase in the size of both
capabilities would therefore be necessary to adequately address the
requirement, through some combination of greater overall force pools,
improving the equipment level of existing European heavy brigades, and a
substantial increase in readiness levels.

That land force would need cover against Russian air attacks, while
[Moscow's huge arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles are pounding
NATO air and supply bases]{.underline}. "The limited amount of available
longer-range air and missile defense would be just sufficient to cover
the necessary front-line air bases for NATO, but there would be no
excess to protect the land component itself or to protect critical
military infrastructure sites such as rear-area headquarters and
logistics," the study warned.

NATO navies would also have difficulty operating in the confined and
missile-rich Baltic, Black and Mediterranean seas. [NATO lacks
sufficient drones and reconnaissance systems]{.underline}, while many
[NATO nations only have enough ammunition for a **few days of
combat**]{.underline}, especially in smart bombs (which NATO ran out of
during limited air strikes on Libya in 2011).

To make matters worse, [the cost]{.underline} of procuring sufficient
equipment and personnel to defeat a Russian invasion of the Baltics
[could be]{.underline} as high as \$**[357 billion]{.underline}**. But
[beyond the **financial cost**]{.underline} of European NATO (which
includes Canada in the IISS study), [there remains the question of how
indispensable the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[is]{.underline} to NATO.

In some ways [NATO]{.underline} can substitute its own resources, but in
others, it **[simply needs America]{.underline}**. "Some of the
capabilities provided by US forces, such as logistics and sustainment
for land forces, may be relatively straightforward if not cheap to
replace," the study concluded. "However, [others are almost **unique to
the US**]{.underline}, and [it would be **difficult to substitute
European capabilities**]{.underline}."

#### Prevents [nuclear war]{.underline}. 

**Brands 19**, the Henry Kissinger Distinguished Professor at Johns
Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies and a
scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Most recently, he is the
co-author of \"The Lessons of Tragedy: Statecraft and World Order.\",
(Hal, November 7th, 2019, "How Russia Could Force a Nuclear War in the
Baltics",
<https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-07/nuclear-war-in-the-baltics-russia-could-force-one>)

Moreover, [this sort of NATO counteroffensive is precisely the situation
Russian nuclear doctrine seems meant to avert]{.underline}. [Russian
officials understand that their country would lose a long war against
NATO]{.underline}. They are particularly alarmed at the possibility of
NATO using its unmatched military capabilities to conduct conventional
strikes within Russian borders. So [[the Kremlin]{.mark} has signaled
that it [might carry
out [limited](https://globalsecurityreview.com/nuclear-de-escalation-russias-deterrence-strategy/) nuclear
strikes]{.mark}]{.underline} --- perhaps a "demonstration strike"
somewhere in the Atlantic, or against NATO forces in the theater --- [to
force the alliance to make peace on Moscow's terms]{.underline}.
[[This]{.mark} [concept](https://nuclearnetwork.csis.org/why-moscow-might-not-reveal-an-escalate-to-de-escalate-strategy/) [is]{.mark}
known as]{.underline} "**[[escalate to
de-escalate]{.underline}]{.mark}**," [[and]{.mark} there is a **growing
body
of [evidence](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2017/february/escalate-de-escalate)** that
[the Russians are serious about it.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[A **NATO-Russia war could**]{.mark} thus **[go nuclear]{.mark}** if
Russia]{.underline} "[escalates]{.underline}" [to preserve the gains it
has won early in the conflict.]{.underline} It could also go nuclear in
a second, if somewhat less likely, way: If the U.S. and
NATO [initiate](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2781.html) their
own limited nuclear strikes against Russian forces to prevent Moscow
from overrunning the Baltic allies in the first place. And [even the
**[limited use]{.mark}** of nuclear weapons [raises the]{.mark} question
of **[further escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [[Would crossing the
nuclear threshold lead]{.underline}]{.mark}, [through deliberate choice
or miscalculation]{.underline}, [[to]{.mark} a general nuclear war
involving intercontinental ballistic missiles]{.underline}, [strategic
bombers and **[apocalyptic destruction]{.mark}**?]{.underline}

So what to do? One option would be [for the West [to **pull
back**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- to conclude that any game that involves
risking nuclear war over the Baltic states is not worth the candle. The
logic here is superficially compelling. After all, the U.S. could
survive and thrive in a world where Russia dominated Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania, just as it survived and thrived during the Cold War, when
those countries were part of the Soviet Union. The problem is that
failing to defend the Baltic states [[would
**devalue**]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[Article
5]{.underline}]{.mark}** guarantee on which NATO rests: the principle
that an attack on one is an attack on all. And given that one could
raise similar questions about so many U.S. commitments --- would
declining to meet a Chinese attack on the Philippines really endanger
America's existence? --- [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} failure [[could
**undermine the**]{.underline}]{.mark} broader **[[alliance]{.mark}
[system]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[that has delivered]{.mark} peace and
[stability]{.mark} for]{.underline} so many **[decades]{.underline}**.

A second
option, [emphasized](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Feb/02/2001872886/-1/-1/1/2018-NUCLEAR-POSTURE-REVIEW-FINAL-REPORT.PDF) by
the Pentagon's 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, would be to devise new
limited nuclear options as a way of strengthening deterrence and
dissuading Russia from pursuing a strategy of escalate to de-escalate.
For example, the U.S. might develop low-yield nuclear weapons that could
be used, in a relatively limited
fashion, [against](https://tnsr.org/2018/11/against-the-great-powers-reflections-on-balancing-nuclear-and-conventional-power/https:/tnsr.org/2018/11/against-the-great-powers-reflections-on-balancing-nuclear-and-conventional-power/) a
Russian invasion force or the units supporting it.

This approach is probably worthwhile, because it would help fill in
missing steps on the escalatory ladder between conventional conflict and
general nuclear war. The knowledge that the U.S. has its own "tactical"
nuclear options might inject greater caution into the calculations of
Russian planners. It is possible, RAND
analysts [note](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2781.html),
that limited nuclear strikes early in a Baltic conflict could convince
the Kremlin that the risks of proceeding are unacceptable.

The dangers here are, well, obvious and drastic. There is always
some [possibility](https://warontherocks.com/2018/02/discrimination-problem-putting-low-yield-nuclear-weapons-submarines-dangerous/) --- although
informed
analysts [debate](https://warontherocks.com/2018/02/discrimination-details-matter-clarifying-argument-low-yield-nuclear-warheads/) how
much of a possibility --- that Russia
might [mistake](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2781.html) a
limited strike against military targets in the Baltics for part of a
larger or more dangerous nuclear strike against Russia itself. And if
the plan is to use limited nuclear strikes against Russian military
assets involved in an invasion of the Baltic states, the implication is
that NATO would be using nuclear weapons on the territory of its own
members.

A third, and best, option is to strengthen the weak conventional posture
that threatens to bring nuclear options into play. The root of NATO's
nuclear dilemma in the Baltics is that the forces it currently has
stationed there cannot put up a credible defense. Yet as earlier studies
have [noted](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1253.html),
[the U.S. and its allies could make a Russian campaign **far harder**
and **costlier**]{.underline} --- [with a much-diminished chance of
rapid success]{.underline} --- [by deploying an enhanced [NATO]{.mark}
force]{.underline} of seven to eight brigade combat teams, some 30,000
troops. That force would include three or four armored brigade combat
teams (as opposed to the one NATO periodically deploys to Eastern Europe
now), along with enhanced mobile air defenses and other critical
capabilities.

Russia couldn't claim credibly that such troops posed any real offensive
threat to its territory. But [the force would be large and robust enough
that Russian troops couldn't destroy it in a flash or bypass it at the
outset of a conflict]{.underline}. [It [would]{.mark} therefore
[**obviate**]{.mark} many of the [**nuclear escalation dynamics** by
making]{.mark} far less [likely a situation in which NATO must escalate
to avoid]{.mark}]{.underline} a ~~crippling~~ [[defeat]{.mark} in the
Baltics]{.underline}, [[or one in which Russia can escalate to
protect]{.mark} its [early victories]{.mark} there]{.underline}.

Developing this stronger conventional deterrent in the Baltics would not
be
cheap: [Estimates](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2781.html) run
from \$8 billion to \$14 billion in initial costs, plus \$3 billion to
\$5 billion in annual operating expenses. Yet neither would it be
prohibitive for the richest alliance in the world. [[The best way of
reducing the danger of a nuclear war]{.mark} in the Baltics [is to
ensure that NATO **won't** ]{.mark}**immediately [lose a conventional
one]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Thwarting Kremlin aggression today for constructive relations tomorrow,"
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/atlantic-council-strategy-paper-series/thwarting-kremlin-aggression-today-for-constructive-relations-tomorrow/>,
jy

[The **immediate**]{.underline} US and allied partners' [goal is to
**thwart**]{.underline} [and **deter**]{.underline} [the Kremlin's
**revisionist foreign policy**, which seeks to weaken NATO]{.underline},
the EU, and their principal states, especially the United States.
[Moscow also seeks to restore **Russian hegemony in
Eurasia**]{.underline}.14 [This requires **prompt action by the United
States**]{.underline}, usually and [preferably along with
**allies**]{.underline} and/or partners, [to impose **a cost on Moscow**
for its aggressions and provocations. Given]{.underline} the power
imbalance between Moscow and the more powerful West, [this **should be
doable**]{.underline} in most instances. [The key]{.underline}, of
course, [is a clear recognition of what Moscow is **up to**]{.underline}
[and the political will to use the United States' **superior resources
to stop Kremlin aggression**. This policy would also serve as a **lesson
urging caution on China**]{.underline}, which watches carefully how
Washington responds to Moscow's misadventures.

To do this effectively, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[needs to use]{.underline} its advantages, which include [its **wide
network of allies** and **partners around the world**]{.underline}; its
[conventional military superiority]{.underline}; its [economic
superiority, including its role at the center of the global financial
system; its record as a supporter of human rights; and its cyber and
information capacities]{.underline}.15

[Washington should]{.underline} also [exploit Russia's
**disadvantages**:]{.underline} its [economic weakness]{.underline},
including its dependence on hydrocarbon exports; its [declining standard
of living]{.underline}; its [shrinking population]{.underline}; [its
population's opposition to the use of Russian troops in Ukraine and
desire to improve relations with the West]{.underline}; the preference
of elites to park their ill-gotten gains and families in the West; and
the fact that the Putin regime has lost the major cities and young
people as a voting bloc.16

[In the **shorter term**, US goals include **seeking
dialogue**]{.underline} with two distinct purposes. [The first is
to]{.underline} manage or [**stabilize the competition** between
Washington and Moscow. This includes **reducing the risk of
escalation**]{.underline} in military confrontations [and **arms
control**]{.underline}.

[The second is to explore]{.underline} possible areas of cooperation
where US and Russian interests overlap---perhaps
**[counterterrorism]{.underline}**, including in Taliban-controlled
Afghanistan; [**reducing military confrontations**; nuclear diplomacy
with **Iran**; reaching an understanding on the use of the **Arctic**;
and dialogues with Russian elites on possible future
cooperation]{.underline} as well as outreach to the Russian people are
also key elements of US strategy.

[The]{.underline} United States' **[longer-term goal]{.underline}** [is
to encourage the evolution of a Russia that sees its role as a
**constructive power** contributing to---not violating---the rules-based
international]{.underline} order. This is not an effort at regime
change. It looks to a day when [Moscow recognizes]{.underline} that the
path to continued [great-power status depends on freeing the creative
talents of]{.underline} its [people who can turn Russia into a global
economic power that attracts its neighbors into closer relations, rather
than seeking to compel them]{.underline} due to an inability to exert
soft power. Such a Russia would be an economic engine in Eurasia and a
natural partner connecting its neighbors with the EU, for instance by
permitting hydrocarbons from Central Asia and the Caucasus to use
Russian pipelines---as required by the EU's third energy package. It
would also make Moscow a natural partner---like the EU---in dealing with
global national security challenges, such as North Korea.17

[What is driving the current relationship]{.underline} between Russia
and China [is Putin's obsession with]{.underline} what he sees as [the
threat of the United States---an obsession that has **little chance of
fading**]{.underline}---and deteriorating relations with Europe. Putin's
view, of course, prevails, but [others]{.underline} in Moscow
[understand]{.underline} that [China is in fact a **danger to Russia's
position**]{.underline} in at least the Far East and perhaps even
Siberia. Eventually though, [when it is clear to Russian policy makers
that US intentions **do not pose a threat** to the integrity of Russia,
Moscow will understand the real national security threat facing
it]{.underline}---[the]{.underline} rising and increasingly [assertive
great power to its **south**]{.underline}.

[The United States **will not be the lever that puts an
end**]{.underline} to this historically anomalous partnership, thereby
isolating China as the only major power seeking to undermine the state
of the global order. But Washington should both understand the dynamic
and publicly pay attention to it.18 As Dmitri Trenin, the director of
the Carnegie Moscow Center, argues, both [Russia and China have **so
many bilateral considerations**]{.underline} toward various countries
that [they prefer to deal with the United States
**bilaterally**]{.underline} and **[not in an alliance]{.underline}**.19

#### The Axis [fails]{.underline}. 

**Kroenig 20** -- Matthew Kroenig, Government and Foreign Service
Professor at Georgetown University. \[The United States Should Not Align
with Russia Against China, 5-13-20,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/united-states-should-not-align-russia-against-china-geopolitical-rivalry-authoritarian-partnership/\]

Now these revisionist autocratic powers are once again working together
closely. In response, many **[national security
strategists]{.underline}** have [argued]{.underline} that [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should]{.underline} seek to
**[peel them apart]{.underline}** by working with Russia to counter the
even bigger threat of China.

But [this recommendation is **misguided**. Autocracies like China and
Russia will not form **a deep strategic partnership**]{.underline}, and
[the [costs of **cozying up**]{.mark}]{.underline} to Russia **[far
[outweigh]{.mark} the benefits]{.underline}**. Fortunately, [there is
**a better path**: Washington can leverage **its democratic
advantages**, working with **its existing democratic allies** to counter
**both Beijing and Moscow** at the same time]{.underline}.

The growing Russian and Chinese strategic relationship is worrying. The
two autocratic powers have cooperated on major energy deals, including a
blockbuster \$55 billion arrangement to pipe Siberian natural gas into
China. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping
have met in several high-level summits, and Xi even declared Putin "his
best friend and colleague." Perhaps most troubling, Beijing and Moscow
have participated in joint military exercises in both Europe and Asia.
If they were to coordinate and conduct simultaneous military attacks on
the U.S. alliance system in Eastern Europe and the Indo-Pacific, for
example, the United States and its allies could be overwhelmed.

These facts have led many observers to conclude that the solution is to
play them off against each other. Just as President Richard Nixon opened
to China to work against Moscow during the Cold War, they argue, today
Washington could do the reverse. China is the bigger threat now, so the
United States could partner with Russia against the rising power in East
Asia.

Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has reportedly urged this
course of action directly in conversations with President Donald Trump,
and Robert Blackwill of the Council on Foreign Relations---a former U.S.
ambassador to India---has recommended that Washington "make concessions
in order to improve its relationship with Moscow" as part of a strategy
to counter China. And these and similar options are being considered in
the working levels of the U.S. government.

But [[Russia and China will not form]{.mark} **an [effective
alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline} against the United States anytime soon.
In a new book, I examined the strengths and weaknesses of democracies
and autocracies in great-power competition and found that autocracies
are poor alliance builders. The ease with which [unconstrained
[dictators]{.mark} **rapidly [shift]{.mark}** their country's [policies,
**backtrack**]{.mark} on [commitments]{.mark}, and dissemble [are
not]{.mark} traits that are [**conducive** to]{.mark} building
**international [partnerships]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Indeed, [[history shows]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[autocratic]{.mark}
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}** tend to [[fight each other **more than
the enemy**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In spite of the Molotov-Ribbentrop
Pact, Adolf Hitler turned on and invaded the Soviet Union, betraying his
partner Joseph Stalin. The major military action of the Warsaw Pact
during the Cold War was attacking its own members, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia. The last time China and Russia were aligned, they nearly
fought a nuclear war with each other in the 1969 Sino-Soviet border
conflict. And Putin invaded Ukraine and Georgia at a time when these
countries were involved in the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent
States.

Moreover, [there are]{.underline} many [**[conflicts]{.mark} of
interest** between Russia and China that will [push them apart]{.mark}
without **any help** from the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.
[Depopulation in [Russia]{.mark}'s Far East]{.underline} has [led to
[fears]{.mark}]{.underline} that [**an expanding [China]{.mark}**
[will]{.mark}]{.underline} attempt a [**[land grab]{.mark}**. Russian
colleagues report]{.underline} that [[Russia's]{.mark} **new
nuclear-armed intermediate-range [missiles]{.mark}** [are not aimed at
NATO but]{.mark} meant to deter **a rising
[China]{.mark}**]{.underline}. More broadly, Moscow was the senior
partner during the Cold War, and Putin will not be keen to now play
second fiddle to Beijing.

#### Wooing Russia is [impossible]{.underline}. 

**Joffe 21** -- Josef Joffe, Government PhD at Harvard University,
distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution. \[Forget the
Russia Card, 1-28-2021,
https://www.hoover.org/research/forget-russia-card-why-putin-will-not-work-america-ally-against-china-beijing-moscow-wants\]

Could a different line-up among the three work today? [[Could America
and]{.mark} **a diminished [Russia]{.mark}** [coalesce against]{.mark}
**the [Beijing]{.mark} Behemoth**? [Yes, if the sun were to rise in
**the west**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are three structural problems
that defy Russo-American collaboration.

One, as no. 1, [the U.S. is **wedded** to **the existing order**, the
foundation of its primacy. Yet China and [Russia are
**revisionist**]{.mark} **powers**]{.underline} who [both want **a much
larger slice** of **the global pie**]{.underline}.

How then would a grasping Russia act as handmaiden of status-quo
America? [The [problem is **not bad blood**, but]{.mark}]{.underline}
Mr. **[Putin's [ambition]{.mark}]{.underline}**. One objective is to
informally reconstitute the Soviet Empire by drawing former USSR
republics as clients into an uncontested Russian sphere of influence.
The second is to cast the shadow of Russian power over Moscow's former
satrapies in Eastern Europe from the Baltics to Bulgaria. The third
quest is to weaken the trans-Atlantic bond between the U.S. and Europe.
The fourth is to secure and expand Russia's sway over the Middle East
and North Africa. Basically, [the game is to **dislodge** the U.S.
**wherever** opportunity beckons]{.underline}.

Given this set of interests, how would Washington recruit Moscow against
Beijing? [[There is **nothing**]{.underline}]{.mark}, save recognizing
Russian sway over the "Stan" countries, [that [the U.S. could
offer]{.mark} to gain **the Kremlin's good will**]{.underline}. But [[If
the U.S.]{.mark} were to [yield]{.mark} on [Europe]{.mark}]{.underline},
Africa, and the Middle East, [it might just as well [**say good-bye**
to]{.mark} **its global [pre-eminence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There is
no deal here because [America cannot pay **such a price**]{.underline}.

Two, another [[reason]{.underline}]{.mark} why a U.S.-Russian
partnership won't materialize [[is **structural**]{.underline}]{.mark}
as well. [[For Russia]{.mark}, the [U.S. remain **the**]{.mark}
**foremost [rival]{.mark}**]{.underline}. So, it pleases Mr. Putin to
play China against America. Nor is this a fanciful prospect. Moscow and
Beijing have already fashioned an alliance of convenience. It is defined
by routine, though often symbolic, military cooperation. Examples are
joint exercises, joint air patrols over the Pacific, advanced Russian
weapons sales, and the training of Chinese officers at Russian
academies.2

Three, [**U.S.-Russian amity** is **limited** because [it makes]{.mark}
**much [more sense]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} two [revisionists to
**unite**]{.mark} against **the top dog** [than for Moscow to
**bandwagon** with Washington]{.mark}]{.underline}. By analogy, recall
the legendary American bank robber Willie Sutton. Why did he break into
banks? He replied: "That's where the money is." The U.S. is the global
bank, so to speak, with power and assets galore. To diminish and thus
weaken no. 1 is a natural for nos. 2 and 3 who want more for themselves
and less for the nation standing in their way. Rob and reap!

Finally, the non-structural factor of ideology. [[China and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} need not fear domestic interference from
each other, as both [[share]{.mark} **the same [authoritarian
faith]{.mark}**]{.underline}. From each other, they won't have to worry
about the kind of condemnation that emanates from democracies like the
United States and threatens their domestic supremacy. In that respect,
[Putin and Xi]{.underline}, despots both, [are
**cousins-in-crime**]{.underline} with a strong interest in maintaining
ideological solidarity.

The upshot: [[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [**[won't]{.mark}** be able to [set Russia
against China]{.mark}, nor **the other way around**, as Kissinger
**tried in the 1970s**]{.underline}. So, [[America must harness]{.mark}
**strategic [friends]{.mark}**]{.underline} elsewhere in order [[to
construct]{.mark} **the double-[containment]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
nos. 2 and 3. Candidates are Europe, Japan, South Korea, Australia,
India, and lesser Asian powers like Vietnam (a former Chinese colony) or
Taiwan (a designated victim of Chinese imperialism). At best, Washington
can play Beijing and Moscow only at the margins---with an ad hoc deal
here or there, but without any hope that such fleeting bargains will add
up to a reliable relationship. Putin will not work for America, and
neither will Xi.

In the abstract, such claims are alarming---in context, and in balance,
rather humdrum. In fact, [[the **ev**]{.mark}**idence** [of

even---on occasion--- to coerce its neighbors. [It uses
**[protectionist]{.mark}**]{.underline} economic
**[[policies]{.underline}]{.mark}** to boost the prospects of Chinese
companies and reduce competition. [It employs **[economic
statecraft]{.mark}**]{.underline} to serve its interests abroad. And it
certainly is opposed to America's policy of global democracy promotion.
[However, **[none]{.mark}** of these positions **[fundamentally
challenge the existing order]{.mark}**, **none** of them **radically

authority**]{.underline}.25 The point is not that two wrongs make a
right; it is that [international order is **much more resilient** than
**critics seem to realize**]{.underline},26 [and it is **utopian** to
expect any **rising Great Power** to act in a way that **uniformly
satisfies** one's **moral scruples**,]{.underline} evolving, in
Friedberg's words, "into a mellow, satisfied, 'responsible' status quo
power."27

Friedberg or Harris might object that America's rise took place in the
context of a different order. This is perfectly true, but the more
important point is that the long nineteenth century (1815--1914)---the
era of America's rise---was the first iteration of the New Peace.28 The
implication is that [relative [peace]{.mark} **[can]{.mark}** and
**has** **[coexist]{.mark}**ed [with]{.mark} **limited wars**,
**property** and **[territorial thefts]{.mark}**, acts of **coercion**,
[and]{.mark} **aggressive [assertions of status.]{.mark}** This does not
mean any of these are **desirable**]{.underline}--- they are [not---but
it shows that they **need not be fatal to the system**]{.underline}.
[Insofar as there **is** a lesson from that **first period** of
**relative peace**, it is that **Great Power confrontation** is the
**one thing that is fatal**]{.underline}. [Accepting this does not mean
**capitulating** in **every instance**, as implied by
some]{.underline},29 [but it **does** mean **rediscovering** the rules
of **Great Power competition**]{.underline}30 alongside the art of
strategy.31

Focusing only on areas that China's rise violates the scruples of the
established powers, moreover, downplays the extent to which [[China,
**has**]{.underline},]{.mark} in fact, [[**conformed** to the **existing
order**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} As a RAND Corporation report published
in 2018 concludes, China has been a supporter---albeit a conditional
one---of the international order: "Since [China undertook a **policy of
international engagement**]{.underline} in the 1980s ... the level and
quality of its participation in the order rivals that of most other
states."32 The way in which **[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Jinping,
following his 2017 Davos speech in defense of globalization, [has been
[heralded as the]{.mark} **most prominent [champion of international
order]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **defender of
[globalization]{.mark}**]{.underline} underscores the fact that [there
are **different elements** of this order, and that China supports
**many**, if not **most, of them**]{.underline}. [Even in places where
China is **supposedly "altering"** the current order, Beijing tends to
simultaneously **affirm that order**]{.underline}. [[China's]{.mark}
[A]{.mark}sian [I]{.mark}nfrastructure [I]{.mark}nvestment
[B]{.mark}ank]{.underline}, for instance, actually **[[mirrors existing

elements and "best practices" of the World Bank and Asian Development
Bank. [[China is **playing the same game**, even if it is **seeking a

#### Hegemony solves [global prolif cascades]{.underline}. 

**Boylan 18,** MA, Doctor of Philosophy thesis. (Andrea K., March 2018,
"Nuclear Proliferation in the Middle East: In Pursuit of a Regional
Logic", pg. 375-379, *Naval Postgraduate School*,
<https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1052511.pdf>)

Despite the predictions of structural theorists, [global nuclear
nonproliferation efforts appeared to **benefit** from the **end of the
Cold War**]{.underline}. [Within the **Middle East,** the trend was
toward a **decrease** in **nuclear proliferation**]{.underline}. In many
world regions, the trend also seemed to deemphasize nuclear weapons. The
exceptions were Northeast Asia and South Asia. [The number of **regional
states** pursuing nuclear weapons **slowly decreased**.]{.underline}
From 1991 to 2003, multiple states either ended nuclear weapons programs
(in the case of Iraq, forcibly) or reduced their nuclear weapons
capabilities. The nuclear weapons programs in Iraq and Libya came to an
end. Argentina, Brazil, and South Africa ended their ballistic missile
programs. Algeria reined in its suspicious nuclear efforts. Belarus,
Kazakhstan, and the Ukraine voluntarily gave up the nuclear weapons
capabilities they had inherited from the Soviet Union. Regions formed
and implemented nuclear-weaponfree zones (NWFZs). By the end of 2003, it
was primarily Iran and North Korea that remained of high concern to the
international community as potential proliferators. This was a clear
decrease from 1991. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates as the **sole
superpower** had **[take]{.mark}n [on the cause of
denuclearization]{.mark}** as one of its top priorities following the
end of the Cold War and global nonproliferation was the winner. [As the
**global hegemon**, it was the]{.mark} **architect** and [**driving
force** behind these endeavors.]{.mark}]{.underline}

What does the role of external management mean for realist outlooks at
both the system level and the regional level? Nuclear proliferation
challenges at the regional level have been handled by the superpowers or
great powers due to the distribution of capabilities among the units in
the international system. They have the capacity to intervene and manage
proliferation issues because of these capabilities. Waltz notes that
these management tasks fall to the great powers as they are "agents of
great capability." 1666 In addition, regional nuclear proliferation has
been viewed as not just a regional threat, but also as a global threat.
Thus, managing these threats mitigates security concerns for the great
powers as well. But [a **unique feature** of **managing proliferation**
in the new multipolar era has been the willingness of great powers (thus
far) to assist in nonproliferation efforts **across Cold War "bloc"
lines**]{.underline}. That is, states have been willing to support
international nonproliferation norms (born in the bipolar era) even
against their narrow self-interested relations with certain
proliferators today.

In addition to the overall decrease in potential proliferators, [a
**strengthened nonproliferation regime** provided **evidence of U.S.
efforts**]{.underline}. Jeffrey Knopf writes that "[many of the global
\[[nonprolif]{.mark}eration\] efforts [resulted from]{.mark} a [**U.S.
initiative**, and it is **hard to imagine** them]{.mark} coming into
being [in the **absence of U.S. leadership**]{.mark}]{.underline}." 1667
During the bipolar period, [[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
recognized the weaknesses of the]{.underline} Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty (**[NPT]{.underline}**) [as regional nuclear proliferation
bloomed. It began to try and **fill** some of the **perceived gaps** and
**loopholes** by initiating the [establish]{.mark}ment of [the **Nuclear
Suppliers Group**]{.mark} and the M]{.underline}issile
[T]{.underline}echnology [C]{.underline}ontrol [R]{.underline}egime. [In
the unipolar period, [the]{.mark} United States instigated
**[Cooperative Threat Reduction]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the
**[[Wassenaar]{.underline}]{.mark}** Arrangement, [United Nations
**Security Council**]{.underline} 1540, [[and]{.mark} the
**[Prolif]{.mark}eration [Security Initiative]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It
also supported the establishment of the Additional Protocol among other
bilateral and multilateral initiatives. Underscoring the critical role
of U.S. leadership, Knopf found in his recent edited volume,
International Cooperation on WMD Nonproliferation, that [[the factors
that **best explained** this]{.mark} cooperation
[were]{.mark}]{.underline} a combination of state self-interest and
**[[U.S. leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}**.1668

In a multipolar setting, nuclear proliferation decreased in the Middle
East. In other world regions, the nuclear proliferation trend appeared
to be similar. The exception was Northeast Asia. And, the especially
hard cases---Iran and North Korea---remained. Both countries had
advanced nuclear weapons programs. External management by the United
States during the unipolar period had come close to reining in both
programs, but the global hegemon had not been completely successful in
either case. The United States would also discover that North Korea had
begun aiding Syria, an ally of Iran, to establish a possible nuclear
weapons program. In this time, other great powers began to function more
as external managers. Three European states---Germany, France, and the
United Kingdom---initiated nuclear negotiations with Iran. China took a
leading role in negotiations with North Korea. This would have been
unthinkable in the bipolar period when the United States was occupied
with trying to block countries like West Germany and China from
providing nuclear technology to various regional states. This was
because U.S. efforts to stem proliferation, particularly in the unipolar
period, helped define what was acceptable and unacceptable nuclear
behavior. Outliers, such as Iran and North Korea, were marginalized and
punished. Countries that eventually complied with accepted proliferation
guidelines, as Libya did, were praised. With the nonproliferation regime
more strongly established in the multipolar period, other states took a
leadership role in enforcing these established guidelines.

The findings of this dissertation, however, may provide a cautionary
warning. [What happens if the **nuclear nonproliferation regime**, which
has helped to **facilitate great power cooperation** and to **control**
the spread of nuclear weapons and assoc**iated technology nuclear
spread,** becomes **weaker**?]{.underline} [What if it]{.underline}s
capacity to influence nuclear proliferation-related activities
[**erodes?** What happens if this occurs during a time of **[intense
competition]{.mark}** in **the international system,** an environment
that [is]{.mark} seemingly [**more conducive** to]{.mark} **[nuclear
spread]{.mark}?**]{.underline} Would external managers once again face a
lack of control over the nuclear supply chain, a lack of awareness of
regional proliferation activities, a lack of coordination or cooperation
by external managers, and an increase in regional foreign policy issues
that might take priority over nuclear proliferation concerns? Or would
the management mechanisms for controlling nuclear proliferation hold?

Thus, what are the implications of this dissertation's findings in
regards to external management and the role of the nonproliferation
regime in the future? In particular, what does this mean for U.S.
policy, given the country's long history of working to control nuclear
spread? What other avenues of research might help further our
understanding of regional nuclear proliferation? The rest of this
chapter is dedicated to answering these questions.

A. FUTURE REGIONAL PROLIFERATION CHALLENGES

If heightened competition in the international system resulted in
increased nuclear proliferation in the past, [[policymakers **cannot
take** the current state of decreased prolif]{.mark}eration [for
granted.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}**[Decreased]{.underline}**
regional nuclear **[proliferation]{.underline}** [seemed to be
**driven** by]{.underline} the advantages enjoyed by [the United States
as the **global hegemon**]{.underline}. While other NPT members have not
always agreed with the U.S. approach to combatting nuclear
proliferation, it has been the state that tackled the issue of
proliferation most aggressively using the full range of options
available to a superpower. [Without U.S. efforts, it is **likely** that
there would have been more nuclear powers than there are
today.]{.underline}

Nevertheless, there would seem to be a real danger that [**increased
competition** [in a **multipolar setting** may result in **less
effective**]{.mark} **external [management]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
same factors that caused increased **nuclear proliferation** under
bipolarity may also characterize **multipolarity**]{.underline}.
**[[The]{.mark} nuclear [nonprolif]{.mark}eration [regime may become
weaker without the driving force of U.S.
heg]{.mark}emony]{.underline}**. Powers such as [[**Russia** and
**China**]{.mark} historically [have had a **less stringent view**
on]{.mark} nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration activities than the United
States]{.underline}. For example, Russia and China have seemed more
willing to accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state. [Thus, the
nonproliferation regime helps facilitate cooperation around the issue of
nuclear proliferation, making it **more** than the sum of its
parts]{.underline}. [But it **would not stand on its own** without
the]{.underline} voluntary [support of the **great
powers.**]{.underline}

### Deterrence\-\--Revisionism\-\--1AR 

#### Russia's revisionist ⁠--- Putin's psychology, actions, and state documents

**Natsios 18**, Executive Professor and Director of the Scowcroft
Institute at the Bush School of Government at Texas A&M University
(Andrew Natsios, 2018, "Introduction: Putin\'s New Russia: Fragile State
or Revisionist Power?," *South Central Review*, 35.1)

John Mearsheimer, the international relations scholar, argues Russia\'s
aggressiveness towards its neighbors stems from western efforts to
extend NATO membership to former members of the Soviet bloc in Eastern
Europe and the Balkans. According to this view, traditional national
interest drives Russia\'s behavior, and NATO extension has been seen by
Putin as a threat to Russia\'s vital national security interests. As a
result, he is responding to that perceived threat through territorial
aggrandizement, aggressive ultra-nationalist ideology, and confrontation
with the West. [From this perspective, the western democracies helped
create Vladimir Putin\'s Russia by impinging on its \"sphere of
influence\" along its borders; thus, Russia is not what international
relations scholars call a \"revisionist power]{.underline}\"---one which
seeks to overthrow the existing international order---but a traditional
state protecting what it sees as its equities and vital national
interests. Other analysts, such as Anne Applebaum, argue Putin\'s
policies are not part of a grand strategy, but are evidence of an
improvised foreign policy. Thus, Russia\'s aggression in Georgia,
Ukraine, Syria, and its threats to the Baltic States, may be seen not as
a carefully designed and executed strategy of conquest, but as
symptomatic of Putin\'s ad hoc, opportunistic foreign policy. He probes
for Western weakness, irresolution, and indecision, and then, if there
is no resistance, he intervenes to extend Russia\'s reach by absorbing
more territory. [The limitation of [these views]{.mark} is that they
[ignore]{.mark} what we know of the [mindset in the Kremlin, the
worldwide reach of Russian **cyber**]{.mark}warfare and black
**[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}**, and the [grievances which
Putin]{.mark} himself has [expressed]{.mark} multiple times
[against]{.mark} the Western [democracies]{.mark}. These [grievances are
rooted]{.mark}, among other factors, [in his]{.mark} **personal
[experience]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} East [Germany]{.mark}]{.underline}. He
and other mid-level operatives were traumatized [[as the USSR]{.mark}
and its satellite Communist states in Eastern Europe and Central Asia
[collapsed]{.mark}]{.underline} in 1990 and 1991. The population of the
Soviet Union shrank by more than 50% from 290 million to 142 million
people in a matter of months. The borders of the Russia state Vladimir
Putin inherited resembled Russia before the reign of Catherine the Great
in the second half of the 18th century rather than Russia of the 19th
and 20th century, Tsarist or Communist. Russia\'s Warsaw Pact occupied
\"allies\" in Central and Eastern Europe threw off Soviet control in a
chain of uprisings which swept across the region in little more than a
year. Most of these states eventually joined the NATO alliance and the
European Union as newly independent democratic capitalist nations.
Vladimir Putin and fellow KGB operatives watched with horror as their
world disappeared almost overnight; they destroyed their police files in
East Germany; and fled the country. In his memoirs, Putin wrote that the
collapse of the Soviet Union was the \"greatest geostrategic catastrophe
of the 20th century,\" an extraordinary, if not bizarre, statement given
the other events of the century. [[Putin]{.mark} has [sought to
return]{.mark} Russia to **great power [status]{.mark}** [by
**weakening**]{.mark} **other [competing powers]{.mark}** [or
**annexing**]{.mark} **neighboring [states]{.mark}** rather than risking
reforms that could be destabilizing in the short term, but would
strengthen Russia as a nation state over the long term. [The]{.mark}
immediate [objectives]{.mark} of Russian foreign policy [are not
mysterious if one examines Putin\'s]{.mark} government\'s public
[rhetoric]{.mark}, its [published documents, and]{.mark} its
[actions]{.mark}. One of Putin\'s greatest strengths has been the
aggressive and systematic pursuit of these strategic objectives [which
include]{.mark}:]{.underline}

- [efforts to **regain military [parity]{.mark}** [with the
  **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates (they are nowhere near
  achieving this)]{.underline}

- [the [neutralization]{.mark}, or at least weakening, [of]{.mark} the
  [NATO]{.mark} alliance]{.underline}

- [the [end]{.mark} of [the **E**]{.mark}uropean **[U]{.mark}**nion as
  one of the most powerful economic blocs in the world]{.underline}

- [the creation of an alternative anti-liberal, authoritarian,
  reactionary governance model]{.underline} of statehood for which
  Russia is trying to gain adherents among far right and far left
  parties wing in Europe (not only are the far-right wing parties of
  Europe pro-Putin, so too is Jeremy Corbyn, the hard-left Labor leader
  in the U.K., and the Syriza Party elected to power in Greece in
  January 2015 which is dominated by Communists)

- [the reconstruction of the historic Russian sphere of influence
  through annexation of parts of neighboring states, or at least their
  realignment out of NATO and the European Union into Russia\'s orbit of
  influence, and the **[projection of Russian power]{.mark} to other
  regions**]{.underline} of the world such as the Middle East and
  Afghanistan (CNN reported on July 25, 2017 that the Russians were
  arming the Taliban in Afghanistan).

Over time [[Putin]{.mark} has **[ruthlessly pursued these]{.mark}
objectives**]{.underline} with great discipline, using some of Russia\'s
vast natural resources to rebuild the Russian military and create a
powerful cyber-security capacity to pursue asymmetrical warfare against
the West and vulnerable countries on the periphery. The Russian
Euro-Asian land mass contains perhaps a third of earth\'s minerals, oil,
and natural gas reserves. This represents an extraordinary treasure and
source of national power, if only they had been efficiently and entirely
used to increase economic productivity, build modern infrastructure, and
construct a knowledge-based economy. But they weren\'t. Putin\'s ability
to use these resources has been curtailed since 2014, when oil prices
collapsed from \$117 a barrel to \$27 at the beginning of 2016 before
rising in 2018 to \$68. Because of this price collapse, Russia suffered
a significant drop in state revenues between 2014 and 2017 due to the
decline in oil prices and western economic sanctions imposed because of
the invasion of Ukraine and Crimea. The ongoing demographic decline of
the country, cuts in social services and pensions because of the revenue
drop, and Russia\'s isolation from international markets by Moscow\'s
deliberate design has constrained Putin\'s ambitions. Does Russia face a
new threat from the Western democracies? U.S. military presence in
Europe (approximately 30,000 combat troops at the end of 2016) was at
its lowest level since before World War II, down from a high of 400,000
during the peak of the Cold War. Even more significant than any real or
imagined threat Putin sees coming from the United States, is that the
American military is going through its most painful retrenchment since
the end of the Vietnam War. The U.S. defense budget by the end of the
Obama Administration had been cut by nearly \$150 billion. The Trump
Administration\'s first budget does request an increase of over \$50
billion in defense spending, but Trump also declared his intention to
improve U.S. relations with Russia. European countries\' military forces
have scaled back to such a degree they have undertaken virtual
unilateral disarmament. [**[Putin\'s]{.mark} Russia\'s expansionary
strategy** with the **[invasion of Ukraine]{.mark}** in 2014, its rapid
**[increase in]{.mark} its [defense]{.mark} budget**, the **annexation
of Crimea**, the rebuilding of its nuclear arsenal, and its military
[intervention in Syria]{.mark}, has all been [undertaken with
**no**]{.mark} **self-evident [threat to]{.mark} Russia\'s survival** or
**vital [national interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Furthermore, China
is Russia\'s only real ally in its competition with the West, at least
at this writing. If Putin\'s strategic objective was to minimize or
reduce external threats to Russia, the invasion of Ukraine was a major
strategic blunder as it has slowly begun to mobilize the previous docile
and distracted Western Alliance to counter the new threat. NATO
officials have now begun publicly raising the alarm bells. Sweden and
Finland which never joined NATO are now engaged in a public discussion
about joining the Alliance, which has broad public support. In the last
year of the Obama Administration, the U.S. redeployed an armored brigade
to Europe which will rotate among Eastern European and the Baltic NATO
members as a response to Russian aggression.

DOMESTIC PRESSURES DRIVING PUTIN\'S BEHAVIOR

The Russian foreign policy riddle may in fact be better explained, per
some essays in this issue, as a response to the power dynamics within
the country rather than by any particular national security doctrine.
These dynamics are internal, not external threats to Putin\'s rule,
certainly not to Russia as a nation-state. Moscow\'s policies may be
driven by the insecurity and illegitimacy of the small circle of
Oligarchs and former KGB agents surrounding Putin who fear their own
people more than they fear any outside threat, a fear which is evidence
of profound, if disguised, weakness.3 After it appeared that Putin had
rigged the 2012 Presidential elections to ensure he returned to power
(he would likely have won anyway), hundreds of thousands of Russians
took to the streets of major cities in protest, which lasted several
months. His relative restraint (protest leaders were arrested and some
tortured but no massacres on the streets took place) in suppressing the
popular uprising may have had more to do with his fear that the internal
security forces might not carry out an order to crush the protest
through brute force rather than any ethical qualms he had about a
bloodbath in the streets. Or, it may have been that Putin wanted to
avoid the embarrassment such a solution to the street uprising would
have caused him internationally. This suggests Putin fears another
public uprising, which is why he has taken control of the public\'s
sources of information. Putin gradually emasculated the electronic major
media outlets, tried to block internet access to the worldwide web, and
has suppressed dissent. He has been accused by his critics of allowing
or ordering the assassination of prominent journalists, civil society
leaders, Oligarchs who have fallen out with Putin, and political
opponents. Accounts differ on the number of journalists who have been
murdered since Putin took power in 1999. They range from 12, according
to a professional association of journalists, to 25, according to an
article in the New Yorker. Opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was murdered
on a bridge in sight of the Kremlin the day before he was to release a
report with evidence that Russian troops were fighting alongside
separatists in the Ukraine. Few analysts have argued that Putin himself
gave orders to assassinate Nemtsov, but the five men convicted of
killing him and sentenced in July 2017 in a Moscow court were Chechens
with ties to Chechnya\'s leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, who is an acolyte of
Putin\'s.4

PUTIN\'S GRAND BARGAIN WITH THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE: SURRENDERING FREEDOM FOR
GUNS, BUTTER, AND THE DREAM OF LOST RUSSIAN GRANDEUR

Putin\'s legitimacy as a ruler has been based on a tacit agreement with
the Russian people that trades individual freedom, democracy, and the
rule of law for economic security. Since the severe economic contraction
after mid-2014, that tacit agreement ended. Putin has now reformulated
the grand bargain with the Russian people. He is promising to bring back
the glorious days of the Soviet Union and earlier Tsarist Empires in
exchange for the Russian public\'s acceptance of his autocratic rule and
a lower living standard.5 Since the drop-in oil prices beginning in the
summer of 2014, the central government has been shoring up the fragile
banking system. Despite the balance sheet\'s visual appeal, Russia under
Vladimir Putin faces a much greater risk of internal implosion than many
in Western capitals understand. This is due to the cuts in public
services and pensions, growing unrest among the Russian elites with
Putin\'s policies, and the Russian military\'s discomfort with Putin\'s
strategic gambling in Ukraine and earlier in Georgia.6 To avoid this
collapse, Putin has redirected the Russian people\'s attention to his
foreign policy adventures and away from his domestic mismanagement and
policy failures, but that has not changed the Russian government\'s
balance sheet. In fact, those adventures have made that balance sheet
more precarious. The Soviet Union collapsed for many reasons in 1990,
but one immediate cause was its bankruptcy. During the West
German-Soviet negotiations over the reunification of East and West
Germany, Mikhail Gorbachev, President of the Soviet Union, repeatedly
asked Helmut Kohl, the West German Chancellor, for billions of dollars
in loans because of the Soviet Union\'s internal financial crisis (which
the German government provided).7 One of the leading energy economists,
Daniel Yergin, argues that oil prices have been recalibrated to a lower
price level, and thus we will not see \$100 a barrel again in the
foreseeable future.8 This has created a gap between Vladimir Putin\'s
strategic objectives and his ability to achieve them. His frustration
may encourage him to take more and ever greater tactical risks which
could result in unintended confrontation with NATO or the United States
directly. Anne Applebaum argues in her essay that Putin has either
infiltrated, co-opted, corrupted, intimidated, or shut down most of the
nascent institutions of Russian democratic pluralism that developed
during the 1990\'s and early 2000\'s such as non-governmental
organizations, religious institutions such as the Russian Orthodox
Church, think tanks, and universities. He has done this to ensure he
faces no competing centers of power in Russian society, which has made
him stronger personally, even as he has made Russian society weaker.
This has set back Russia decades from joining other advanced countries,
all of which share several critically important characteristics---a
vibrant civil society (which constrains governmental abuses that would
otherwise go unchecked), an independent judiciary to guarantee the rule
of law, and a free press and media. Putin has now undermined all of
these nascent institutions. Russia has neither rule of law nor an
independent court system, and its police are corrupt and a tool of
repression rather than law enforcement. Russia has evolved into what
Russians call a \"managed democracy,\" a democracy in appearance, not
reality.9 Russian institutional weakness may be found in the retarded
level of internal development and the dysfunctional characteristics of
its governance structure. Douglass North, the Nobel-prize winning
economist, argued that what distinguishes wealthy, advanced, and stable
countries from those in the developing world is the density, legitimacy,
resilience, and robustness of its governmental, private sector, and
civil society institutions.10 By any measure, Russia has a weak private
sector of formally incorporated businesses, a declining number of
independent and increasingly fragile civil society organizations, and a
massive state sector controlled by a small oligarchy in Moscow. During
the Cold War, some Western analysts described the Soviet Union as a
third-world country with the bomb because of its primitive health care
system, poor infrastructure, lack of a consumer economy, and an
inefficient collectivized agricultural system and industrial sector.
Many of these same weaknesses continue to hold Russia back from
developing into an advanced industrial democracy. Russia\'s current
social, health, demographic, and economic indicators show a country in
what could be permanent and irreversible decline, as documented in Nick
Eberstadt\'s essay. Russia is neither a western nor even a middle-income
country, but a fragile state that has more in common with the poorest
developing countries than middle income countries. These weaknesses
suggest Russia is a declining power, and certainly not a rising power
such as China.11 Paul Collier argues in his book, The Bottom Billion,
that abundant natural resources can be a curse more than a blessing in a
country with fragile institutions. In such a country, these resources
will corrupt and undermine the legitimacy of the state and hamper the
development of accountable institutions. The evidence suggests Russia is
a poster-child for Collier\'s \"resource curse\" and thus its resources
are a source of weakness, but, they are also simultaneously a source of
strength because they allow Putin to do things he could not otherwise
do. Some of this wealth has been squandered on mismanaged show and tell
projects such as the \$51 billion spent to prepare for the Sochi
Olympics.12 And a portion of the oil and gas infrastructure revenues
have been siphoned off to enrich Putin\'s inner circle of former KGB
agents who now control perhaps a third of the oil and gas wealth of the
country.13 Some of this oil and gas wealth, which makes up about 50% of
the Russian government\'s revenues (another 15% is generated by mineral
revenues), has been used by Putin to ensure pension and paychecks have
been paid on time after the chaos of the 1990\'s. However, those
pensions are now in danger as oil revenues can no longer support their
current benefit levels. That oil and gas wealth also provides Russians
with stable government jobs in exchange for the public\'s tacit
acceptance of Putin\'s growing centralized, autocratic power, but they
do little to transform Russia into an advanced economy.14

RUSSIA\'S MILITARY AND CYBER WARFARE BUILD UP

One of the few elements of Russian national power now on the ascendency
is its military. Putin had been rearming Russia at a rapid rate until
2017 when revenues could not support the increases. The Duma recommended
a 27% cut in military spending for 2017 because of the depressed oil
prices, while Jane\'s reported a 25% cut. In fact, the reduction in the
Defense Ministry operational budget was about 7% according to an
analysis in the National Interest.15 This analysis argues that the
Russia military industrial corporations were heavily indebted and the
Defense Ministry decided to relieve this debt on a one-time basis, which
made the defense cuts larger than they actually were. [[Putin has
invested in]{.mark} the modernization of [Russia\'s nuclear arsenal
and]{.mark} the development of [new]{.mark} and more **advanced
[conventional weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}, even as Russia faces a
depressing demographic future with high rates of drug addiction and
alcoholism among young men.16 Perhaps the greatest risk to Putin\'s
strategic buildup may be this dependence on oil, gas, and mineral
revenues. To minimize the effect of declining revenue on the defense
buildup, Moscow has made a series of strategic decisions to choose guns
over butter: cutting back public services such as education, health, and
pensions. Disposable income for the average Russian family declined by
15% between 2014 and 2016, even as the military budget has been
increasing. At the end of 2016, for the first time in seven years,
Russian families were spending more than half their income on food and
\"the percentage of Russians who had any savings fell from 72% in 2013
to 29% in 2016,\" reported the Washington Post.17 The rising Russian
military threat was on display in Putin\'s invasion of Ukraine and
annexation of Crimea, but he miscalculated in several critical respects.
According to Moscow, a corrupt and illegitimate government had taken
power through street demonstrations while Putin\'s
democratically-elected ally in Kiev was driven from office by mob rule
funded by billionaire George Soros and western civil society groups.
Putin expected to be greeted by at least half of Ukraine as a Slavic
liberating hero because eastern Ukraine has historically been more
oriented towards Russia. Instead, Russia met Ukrainian resistance, and
united what had been a divided country now mobilized to oppose the
Russian invasion.18 Multiple independent surveys of Ukrainian public
opinion show at least 90% of the population opposes the Russian invasion
and wants Russian troops to leave the country. The Russian military
showed its strengths and weaknesses in the Ukrainian crisis. Its
conventional weapons systems were substantially superior, eventually
overwhelming the Ukrainian army, but its strategic planning was weak,
its manpower pool for its army seriously constrained, and its command
and control problematic.19 Russia\'s new cyberwarfare capabilities were
on display in 2016 in a highly visible way during the 2016 U.S.
Presidential election, the Dutch and French elections, and German
parliament hacking incidents. Perhaps the most authoritative public
document describing Russian attempts to influence the 2016 U.S.
elections may be found in the indictment submitted in federal court by
U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller on February 16, 2018 against three
Russian corporations and 13 individuals employed by or affiliated with
those corporations. One of these Russian corporations, Internet Research
Agency, owned by a close associate of Putin, Yevgeny Progozhin, sought
to manipulate American voters by creating social media pages that made
it appear to be controlled by U.S. political activists and focused on
divisive political issues such as immigration, race, and religion.
Starting in 2014, Internet Research Agency\'s employees created false
personas on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms to post on these
pages. The company also purchased advertisements online to direct
individuals to these pages (funded through U.S. bank accounts and PayPal
accounts established under stolen American identities), and posed as
U.S. grassroots organizations to stage political rallies. Closer to the
election, employees were instructed to post material to support Donald
Trump and Bernie Sanders and to disparage Hillary Clinton, Marco Rubio,
and Ted Cruz. Even after the election, the company coordinated rallies
to protest the election results and stir up political discord. It was an
effort to use America\'s open society, open information, and public
discourse against itself, not simply to support one candidate over
another but to disrupt American society and turn one group against
another. One of the statutes which the Russian operatives were accused
of violating was the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), a law
enacted in 1938 to investigate Nazi propaganda efforts in the United
States. The use of this anti-Nazi law to charge the Russians is one more
indication of how much of a threat this is viewed by the U.S. justice
system, and the state of Russian-American relations. Leaving aside the
question of whether President Donald Trump or his campaign managers
collaborated, intentionally or not, with Putin\'s operatives, the
indictments have placed a bright public spotlight on Russian espionage
activities in the United States. During the Cold War, the KGB undertook
similar activities as did other Great Powers, so espionage is not new
nor particularly shocking. Adolph Hitler undertook similar espionage
tactics in the United States in the 1930\'s, which is why the 1938
Foreign Agents Registration Act was passed in the first place. What is
new is that it is happening now, at this moment and what the reaction
has been in the United States and Europe. More than any other single
effort since Vladimir Putin, his oligarchs and operatives took power,
Russian election espionage to disrupt U.S. and European elections have
convinced a rising body of public and elite opinion in the western
democracies that Russia under Vladimir Putin and his oligarchs is an
enemy, not simply a rival. Perception is often reality in politics. The
first Trump Administration National Security Strategy released in
December 2017 identified the two central geostrategic threats to the
United States as China and Russia, not ISIS, not terrorism, not North
Korea or Iran. This assertion was made in a document signed by Donald
Trump, who wished months earlier for a very different relationship with
Russia and Vladimir Putin. Putin\'s clumsy old-style KGB efforts to muck
around in American politics has unintentionally ignited a new Cold War
which the American and European publics, until this point, had not
wanted to believe or had ignored. If that was Putin\'s goal, he was
successful, but it is very unlikely he intended this at all because it
now means western governments will marshal their very considerable
instruments of national power and focus them on Russia which Putin can
ill afford given the fragility of the country. Some media reports stated
that Putin blamed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the street
demonstrations against the 2012 rigged election, that he apparently
believed she organized through Russian civil society organizations.
Putin, perhaps anticipating public hostility to the election corruption,
expelled the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission
in Moscow months before the 2012 elections. He correctly believed USAID
was responsible for helping build Russian civil society over the
previous two decades. It had been funding U.S. democracy NGOs such as
the International Republican Institute and the Democratic National
Institute to help strengthen Russian political parties and election
processes for the 2012 elections. USAID has done this openly and
consistently in countries around the world since these democracy
programs were created in the 1980\'s and is not directed for or against
any particular parties or candidates. While it was certainly the case
that USAID, along with European aid agencies, helped support a nascent
civil society in the post-Soviet years (something most western aid
agencies do across the globe), there is no evidence of any conspiracy in
the U.S. government to mobilize these groups to protest. Later, Russian
cyber-warfare agencies hacked into the Democratic National Committee
email system and accessed Clinton campaign advisor John Podesta\'s
emails. Several weeks before leaving office, President Obama retaliated
against the Russian hacking by imposing limited sanctions on Russia and
expelling a few diplomats. He was six months late in imposing these
sanctions as the Washington Post has documented. The Post reported the
CIA presented President Obama a detailed account in June 2016 of how the
Russian government intended to interfere in the U.S. election, but the
President, took no serious actions to stop Russia until late October,
and then modestly.

[THE IDEOLOGY AND MYTHOLOGY OF THE PUTIN STATE]{.underline}

[Putin]{.underline} has positioned himself and Russia as a culturally
and religiously conservative alternative to western secular liberal
democracies. This [world view is described in Project
Russia]{.underline}, which is a curious, if alarming, collection of
essays published in five-volumes as a semi-official government
publication that describes the political ideology of the State, the
Orthodox Church\'s religious vision, geographic determinism, and social
analysis shared by Putin and his circle of oligarchs who rule Russia.
[These essays form a strange amalgam of anti-democratic, reactionary,
ultra-nationalist attacks on western democratic values, combined with an
unhealthy dose of conspiracy theories, paranoia, xenophobia, and a
defense of autocratic government and dictatorship]{.underline}.20 One
view of Project Russia is that its publication simply reflects Putin\'s
understanding as a former KGB agent that a great power must have an
ideology to defeat and undermine its rivals in propaganda battles. But a
more sinister and alarming view is that [[the]{.mark} five [volumes are
Putin\'s blue print for Russia\'s]{.mark} grand [strategy]{.mark},
**evidence [of a revisionist power]{.mark}** seeking to overthrow the
existing international order. If this interpretation of Project Russia
is correct, it suggests a greater level of future conflict]{.underline}
with the western democracies and international institutions. If Project
Russia is a blue print and not just a propaganda tool, [the risk of an
accidental **global conflagration** between Russia and the NATO alliance
is a serious potential scenario]{.underline}. Vladimir Putin must find
ways of explaining to the Russian people why the country is so far
behind the western democracies, as did his predecessors in the Soviet
Union. Putin continues to pursue the Soviet strategy of keeping the
memory of World War II alive to stir up Russian nationalism among the
population, but also as an explanation for Russia\'s underdevelopment.
The evidence suggests that this strategy faces increasing hurdles. The
Soviet Union\'s epic and extraordinary sacrifices during World War II --
approximately 11 million soldiers and 9 million of their civilians
having died -- no longer have much resonance with the younger
generation, who know little about the war, and the older generation, who
tire of a war 70 years ago being used to explain Russian inability to
match Western living standards today. Thus, what had been a powerful
historical experience of collective suffering and sacrifice during World
War II, has now become a fading memory which lacks the magnetic power it
held over the Russian people during the Cold War.21 Undoubtedly, one of
[[the motivations behind Putin\'s attempt to regain Russia\'s lost
stature]{.mark} in the world, [expand its **s**]{.mark}phere
**[o]{.mark}**f **[i]{.mark}**nfluence, attack western democratic
institutions, [and annex]{.mark} the [territory]{.mark}]{.underline} of
its neighbors [[is driven]{.mark} by a need [to avenge the]{.mark}
supposed \"**secret [conspiracy]{.mark}**[\" among]{.mark} the Western
[democracies to]{.mark} **collapse**, **destroy**, and **[humiliate
Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}.22 The Russian electronic media and
Project Russia continue to propagate this view. The Russian
government\'s arming of the Taliban, reported by U.S. intelligence
sources and by CNN, may be a response to U.S. military intervention in
Syria against the Assad Government, an ally of Russia, but it could also
be payback for the CIA\'s arming of the Mujahedeen fighting against th
Russian military in Afghanistan during the 1980\'s.23 (Some in the
Reagan Administration saw the arming of the Mujahedeen as U.S. payback
for Soviet support for North Vietnam during the Vietnam War.) The Cold
War certainly involved the arming of U.S. and Russian client states
against each other, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991,
U.S. policy changed to one of facilitating the integration of Russia
into the international system and its conversion into a democratic
capitalist system. Both the U.S. and Europe spent billions of aid
dollars in programs in Russia from 1991 to 2012 to support these
political and economic reforms. If they intended to destroy Russia
permanently, why would they have made these large investments? It is
also the case that President George H.W. Bush went to great lengths to
avoid dancing on the grave of the Soviet empire as it collapsed to avoid
giving fodder to Mikhail Gorbachev\'s critics.

Second, [efforts at **resetting the relationship** with Russia are
**bound to fail**, most likely **at Russia's hands**]{.underline}.
[Russian political leaders]{.underline} -- whether they are czars,
politburo chairmen or 'elected' presidents -- [are **strongly
incentivised by domestic politics** to **demonise the West** and
therefore to pursue adversarial, zero-sum policies]{.underline}.
Although there are many variables that contribute to a country's foreign
policy formulation, geopolitical factors play a significant role in
Russia. More specifically, [Russia's porous and largely indefensible
borders have]{.underline}, [over centuries, contributed to a strong
perception of insecurity -- an insecurity that some Russian political
leaders have become **skillful in exploiting** for political and
personal gain.]{.underline}

[The early-to-mid 1990s, when Russia appeared to be a partner, was an

### Deterrence\-\--Link\-\--1AR 

#### NATO prevents European disintegration. 

**Michta 19**, PhD, Dean of the College of International and Security
Studies at the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies.
(Andrew A., 10/23/19, \"Without the US, European Defense Will Fall to
Pieces\", American Interest,
https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/10/23/without-the-us-european-defense-will-fall-to-pieces/)

The larger problem is that the impasse in the current debate about
"European defense" is playing out against the backdrop of a rapidly
deteriorating security environment around Europe (and increasingly also
within), while [the push for an **autonomous European army** seems
increasingly to be the result of **ad hoc politics** rather than a
**sound defense calculus**]{.underline}. Amidst the various acronyms and
semantic exercises of the past three years, [what is missing in Europe
today is a **keen grasp of history**]{.underline} as well as strategic
foresight. First, [politicians seem to have **all but forgotten** that
[the European project was **possible**]{.mark} **to begin** with
**precisely [because]{.mark}** [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates,
**[[through]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**
alliance, [[provided the]{.mark} **overarching [security
umbrella]{.mark}** for the Continent, **[defusing]{.mark} postwar
[resentments]{.mark}** []{.mark}and assisting in Europe's
**reconstruction**]{.underline}. It bears remembering that, [without
America's **commitment to Europe**, the Franco-German "grand
reconciliation" would have taken much longer to attain, if it were to be
achieved **at all**]{.underline}. And so today, as during the Cold War,
[it makes sense for European states to speak of "Europe" when it comes
to **trade** and **economic policy** integration.]{.underline}
**[However]{.underline}**, [[Europe's security has]{.mark} since 1945
[been a **direct function** of]{.mark} its having been **embedded into
[the Transatlantic system]{.mark}**, and this fundamental
reality]{.underline} **[still remains true]{.underline}** today. Simply
put, [there is a **great deal of difference** between the notion of a
protected "**common market**"]{.underline} [linking]{.underline} the
economies of [likeminded]{.underline} democratic [governments, and that
of Europe acting as a **unitary actor** on **security and
defense.**]{.underline}

And yet, [if a number of governments in Europe
believes]{.underline}---as seems increasingly to be the case---that
[they can establish [a]{.mark} "[European]{.mark}" [defense
structure]{.mark} and a "European security architecture,"]{.underline}
then [[the outcome will be]{.mark} a **hollowing out of
NATO**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} at the very least [[a
**bifurcation of Europe**]{.mark} between the countries facing Russia
along the **eastern flank** and]{.underline} the [those]{.underline}
that [during the **Cold War**]{.underline} [constituted **Western
Europe**]{.underline}. (Even here [the **[divergent security
optics]{.mark}** are likely to **[pull]{.mark} individual
[countries]{.mark}** [in **different directions**]{.mark}, with
countries like France looking **south**, and others, such as the
Scandinavians, focusing on the **north**.) [The endgame will]{.mark} not
[be]{.mark} a "pan-European" security and defense system
but]{.underline} rather [a **back to the future scenario**: [a **new age
of insecurity**]{.mark} in Europe, [where **deep power
differentials**]{.mark} among states on the Continent will yield a
**hierarchy of national interests** that [will]{.mark} **quickly
[decompose]{.mark}** a **larger sense of [European solidarity]{.mark}**.
The countries in Central Europe]{.underline}, which are deeply invested
in the European Union as a pathway to economic modernization, [will
nonetheless **never wager** their national survival on a pan-European
defense and security architecture, any more than powers in Western
European will be able to **credibly guarantee** that in an extreme
situation]{.underline}---**[without America's
backing]{.underline}**---[they would be able to **bring their societies
to the brink of war** and beyond to defend the **Baltic** State**s**,
Poland, or Romania.]{.underline}

[[In the Ukraine crisis]{.mark}, **[Putin]{.mark} first
[probed]{.mark}** [with little green men to determine]{.mark} his
[freedom of maneuver]{.mark} in Crimea and, **[in the absence of
resistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [brazenly [seized the
territory]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Kremlin then stoked the idea of a
'Russian Spring' across southern and eastern Ukraine, creating the myth
of Novorossiya and seeking to spark spontaneous revolts using 'political
tourists' from Russia. When that failed, Russia introduced Special
Forces and intelligence operatives in Slavyansk, using the town as a
base from which to seek to destabilize eastern Ukraine. And once
Ukrainian forces gained their footing, nearly defeating the rebel
forces, [Russia opted for full-scale invasion]{.underline}. Today, the
so-called separatists -- former miners and farmers according to Putin --
command greater quantities of the most advanced heavy weaponry than most
European NATO nations.

While Ukraine is ground zero in the current struggle, [there is no doubt
that Putin's sights are firmly fixed on]{.underline} the two tiny
nations that have dared stand up to his bullying: [Moldova and
Georgia]{.underline}. Moscow attempted to sway Moldova's recent
elections with massive support for new pro-Kremlin parties, is courting
separatists, and is poised to destabilize the nation. Despite Georgia's
efforts to normalize relations with Moscow, Russia has continued its
creeping annexation of Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South
Ossetia.

In the first instance, [[Putin has used this crisis to **consolidate
his**]{.mark} **own [hold]{.mark}** on [at home]{.mark}]{.underline},
through greater repression of civil society and independent media even
as he fuels a nationalist fervor. [He has created an environment of fear
and intimidation]{.underline}, at a minimum fostering the circumstances
that led to the assassination of Boris Nemtsov. After all, the protests
led by Nemtsov, much like the Maidan in Ukraine, pose a potentially
existential threat to Putin's regime.

[Putin of course is also seeking to dominate his neighbors]{.underline},
to drain them of resources to fuel his kleptocracy, [and to restore a
sense of Russia's greatness in the only way a bully knows --
intimidating the weak, closest to him]{.underline}.

[Furthermore, he aims to prevent any of his neighbors from joining
either NATO]{.underline} or the EU, [achieving this through coercion
when possible and by dismemberment and occupation where
necessary]{.underline}.

Ultimately, [Putin knows that [the best check on his power is a **united
transatlantic community**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Hence, he [has **sought
to divide Europe**]{.mark}, undermining the resolve for sustained
sanctions]{.underline}. But [[the most tempting objective]{.mark} for
Putin [is **to call into question the credibility of NATO's**]{.mark}
**Article 5 [mutual defense commitment]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [as
[doing so **would**]{.mark} **effectively [end]{.mark} both [NATO and
America's role as a great]{.mark} European
[power]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[A Russian move against an ally such as a **Baltic state cannot be ruled
out**]{.underline}. [[Putin has demonstrated]{.mark} time and again
[that **if he senses an opportunity to act**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[he
will]{.mark}, convinced that the West lacks the will or ability to take
decisive action]{.underline}. Debaltseve is only the latest case in
point.

This is why today's situation is so dangerous. [Putin will not stop and
this **crisis will not end until he encounters serious
pushback**]{.underline}.

[We have seen repeatedly that Putin's objectives expand with success and
**contract with failure**]{.underline}, or even the increased chance of
failure. [This means that **[the best determinant of his action is
Western action]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

There's a tendency, however, in Washington to argue that the Europeans
should take the lead on Ukraine -- after all we have our hands full with
ISIS and other global responsibilities. This approach fails to
understand that only the United States can galvanize Europe and other
members of the international community around a tough-minded
comprehensive strategy to deter Putin.

The Ukraine crisis is a Russia crisis after all. And [Russia is too big,
too strong, and too scary for Europe to resolve this without
us]{.underline}. Germany may be a political and economic powerhouse, but
Putin knows Chancellor Merkel cannot enforce European diplomacy. While
the Chancellor has done a remarkable job in holding Europe together in
this crisis, no European state can afford to get into a confrontation
with Russia.

[Without US leadership in this crisis, Putin might succeed in creating a
new dividing line in Europe]{.underline}. As he creates facts on the
ground, he shifts the goalposts of what becomes an acceptable outcome in
European diplomacy focused on ending violence. [Europe may feel **forced
to accommodate a revanchist Russia** rather than check its
power]{.underline}. As we've seen throughout history, this is a
dangerous formula.

**[[Only US leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in this crisis [provides
the necessary condition to **ensure** ]{.mark}**the [sustained resolve
of our allies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, most of who are bearing a far
greater economic cost to their own economies.

[Our strategy today is basically to raise the costs on Russia by
imposing sanctions, protect NATO, and count on the long-term
fundamentals, which are on our side and are working against
Russia]{.underline}. The problem is that we have an immediate crisis.
[Putin likely sees the **immediate future as his best window of
opportunity**]{.underline}. [And in the short-term, we may see a group
of nations lose their sovereignty and Russia tempted to **push further
into NATO territory**]{.underline}. We can avoid this outcome. [The
United States has the ability to rally its allies and international
partners around a comprehensive strategy that not only deters Putin's
aggression, but also avoids an unstable grey zone in Europe's
east]{.underline}.

#### Deterrence collapse causes [invasion]{.underline}.

Enterprise Institute. (Leon, \"The risks of a Russian intervention in

Yet as startling as it might seem, [the **turbulence in
Belarus**]{.underline} also [gives Russia's president an
**opportunity**]{.underline} --- [one he could **seize** with a
**high-stakes display of brazen military aggression**]{.underline} that
could go beyond merely cracking down in Belarus. Perhaps [the most
frightening scenario]{.underline}: [an **invasion of
Lithuania**]{.underline}. The Baltic republic, which shares a 420-mile
border with Belarus, is a member of both the European Union and NATO.

[[Combining a **raid on Lithuania** with an **intervention in

threat of a Western-oriented regime in Minsk. [[He could
**drown**]{.mark} his own people's [**resentments** in]{.mark} **fear
and [patriotic exultation]{.mark}**, as he did with]{.underline} the
annexation of **[Crimea]{.underline}** in 2014. [And]{.underline}
perhaps most important for him personally, [he would revenge the fall of
the Soviet Union by **humiliating** and **wounding NATO**]{.underline}
--- that predatory and perennially plotting bugaboo, which every Russian
alive today has been taught to hate.

While hardly a cakewalk, [[such a scenario is]{.mark} **well within the
realm of the [possible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Russian and the
Belarusian militaries have exercised together in Belarus for many years.
Belarus's top officers graduated from the same Soviet military schools
and academies as their Russian counterparts. Just within the past few
days, as Lukashenko's fate appeared increasingly uncertain, the two
countries have launched a new round of joint exercises, introducing a
major element of uncertainty.

[[A raid would be a]{.mark} **very [limited
operation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. No tanks would roll into Vilnius.
[[Seizing **Lithuanian territory**]{.mark}, perhaps a few kilometers
deep on the Lithuanian side of the Belarus-Lithuania border to "thwart a
NATO aggression," and [then showing that **Russia had gotten away with
it**, would be the point.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Lithuania is host to a NATO battalion of 1,092 troops from Germany,
Belgium and the Netherlands. [Yet like the other two NATO battalions in
Estonia and Latvia, the alliance [troops]{.mark} in Lithuania
[are]{.mark} not [there]{.mark} to stop a Russian invasion but [to serve
as a "**tripwire**,"]{.mark} an embodiment of Article Five of the NATO
charter: An attack on one is an attack on all.]{.underline}

[But **tripwire [deterrence]{.mark}** [is **only as good as
the**]{.mark} **tripper's [belief that it will trigger an
explosion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And [Putin may consider such an
explosion **less likely** at a time when **NATO disunity is** probably
**at its greatest** since the **end of the Cold War**]{.underline}.
President Trump recently started withdrawing a third of the U.S. troops
in Germany. German Chancellor Angela Merkel intends to boycott the Group
of Seven summit in Washington, and the French president contends that
NATO is experiencing "brain death."

Moscow has already staged a rehearsal. The large-scale Zapad 2017
military exercise included a simulated "counteroffensive" against an
attack from three fictitious countries bordering Russia and Belarus in
the northwest. The war game included the test-firing of nuclear missiles
and flights of strategic bombers over the Atlantic, Baltic and Norwegian
Seas.

[It is child's play for the Russian troll factories to **flood the
Internet with disinformation**]{.underline} --- [including "deepfake"
images of a pending NATO invasion of Belarus from
Lithuania]{.underline}. The Baltic republic has been among the most
vociferous critics of Putin's Russia, often harboring political exiles
from Russia and Belarus --- and it is currently hosting Belarus
opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya.

Technically, Russia and Belarus have been a "union state" since 1999, so
Putin would argue that military intervention to restore the "legitimate
authority" in Minsk would not only be a "fraternal" Russian impulse but
also a legal obligation.

When the Kremlin sent its troops into rebellious Czechoslovakia this
month 52 years ago, Soviet citizens were told that the Red Army was
moving to forestall an invasion by the West Germans. [[Putin can]{.mark}
reasonably [hope]{.mark} that the trajectory of [the West's reaction
would resemble]{.mark} that which followed the crushing of the Prague
Spring: **fulminations, [hand-wringing and
sanctions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Yet [Russia could probably cope as
long as it can continue to sell its oil and gas --- while betting on a
willingness to "reset relations,"]{.underline} four or so years down the
road with whoever is sitting in the White House.

In the meantime, [[the Kremlin's]{.mark} geopolitical [gains could be
**enormous**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Like the U.S.S.R. before it, [[Russia
would be **permanently feared**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- or, as Putin
sees it, respected. NATO's [[Article Five]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
cornerstone of collective defense, [[would be rendered a
**fiction**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The alliance might start to
**unravel**]{.underline} as countries on its eastern flank sought
individual "accommodations" with Moscow. Ukraine's hesitant drift to the
West would be likely to be arrested for the foreseeable future as well.

It is just as obvious what needs to be done to forestall this dismal
scenario: an emergency summit meeting of NATO, a quick vote to stand
with Lithuania and, most of all, the deployment of troops as fast and as
close to the Lithuanian border with Belarus as the complicated logistics
allow.

But don't hold your breath. It is hard to repair in days what has been
neglected for years.

with Russia Against China, 5-13-20,

While these **[autocratic powers]{.underline}** may cooperate when
convenient and opportunistically exploit U.S. weaknesses, they [are
**not likely** to]{.underline} form an enduring and coordinated alliance
that will [pose **a major threat** to the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates.

Furthermore, [there is **[little]{.mark}** to be [gained and **much to
be lost**]{.mark} by attempting [to **sidle up to Moscow**. Russia is
**unlikely**]{.mark} to be open [to]{.mark} helping Washington
**[confront]{.mark}** [Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline}. While
[Russia]{.underline} does not want to subordinate itself to China, it
[does not want to be **openly antagonistic** toward it]{.underline}
either.

In addition, [Putin will not]{.underline} want to [bolster [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [the country
[he sees as **his**]{.mark} **foremost [enemy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
exchange for giving China a cold shoulder, Putin would almost certainly
demand unpalatable concessions, such as granting Russia a sphere of
influence in Eastern Europe and limiting U.S. missile defenses.

[**Even [if]{.mark}** [Putin did promise]{.mark} to work with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [[it would be **a mistake** to
believe him]{.underline}]{.mark}. Putin cannot be trusted to abide by
arms control agreements or cease-fires in eastern Ukraine. Why would
Washington stake its strategy for the most important national security
challenge of the 21st century on his word?

Finally, [[Russia does not bring **much to the table**]{.mark}. It is
**a [declining]{.mark} power** [with **a GDP smaller than
Italy's**]{.mark}]{.underline}. When energy prices are high, Russia can
afford an impressive military, but [oil prices have been
**sagging**]{.underline}, and [[Russia's military]{.underline}]{.mark}
spending [has [declined over]{.mark} **the past several
[years]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Fortunately, the United States has other potential partners from which
to choose. Democracies excel at building effective alliances, and the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates enjoys formal
[alliances]{.underline} with the 29 other members of NATO, as well as
Japan, South Korea, and Australia. These nations [account for 59 percent
of **global GDP**]{.underline}. This compares favorably with only a
combined 19 percent of global GDP for Russia and China.

The power of this alliance of free nations could be better harnessed in
a global strategy to counter autocratic revisionist powers. The free
world is concerned about the threats posed by China and Russia and are
already cooperating on similar policy measures to counter them, but
these efforts could be amplified with a coordinated global strategy led
by the United States. [Rather than pursue alliances with **shifty
dictators**, Washington should play to **its strengths** and mobilize
**its existing strategic partnerships**]{.underline}.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and **its democratic
allies** already enjoy the economic, military, and political power
needed to excel in **this new era** of **great-power
competition**]{.underline}. Beijing and Moscow, not Washington, are the
ones that should worry about powerful and ideologically hostile enemies
aligning against them.

[[**Even if** they linked]{.mark} arms to threaten the

[If direct military confrontation is out of bounds, then what can
Beijing and Moscow do using economic, political, and diplomatic power or
tools of **hybrid war**fare? The answer to that question is easy:
**exactly what they are already doing**.]{.underline}

We have plenty of evidence of on-going political warfare aimed at the
United States, its friends, allies, and interests. Some of these
activities are conducted in tandem; some are instances of copy-catism;
and some are independent and original.

The political warfare takes many forms---ranging from corrosive economic
behavior to aggressive diplomacy to military expansionism and more.

All [these malicious efforts]{.underline} are a problem. What they
[**[don't add]{.mark} up to is an [existential threat]{.mark}** to vital
U.S. interests]{.underline}. In other words, [[we can **handle this
without sucking up to Putin**]{.mark} and undermining our own interests.
In fact, we **already have** a national-security strategy that
**adequately addresses these concerns**]{.underline}.

[One more thing **inhibiting** a Sino-Russian hookup. **[Russian and

malicious activities [against the **U**]{.underline}nited

So, now [everybody]{.underline} wants to be Bismarck. They see
themselves shaping history by artfully moving big pieces on the
geostrategic chessboard. And one gambit they just [can't
resist]{.underline} is [moving to snip the growing bonds of Sino-Russian
cooperation]{.underline}.

My advice to them: **[Just stop]{.underline}**.

[[Fears of]{.mark} an allied [China and Russia]{.mark} running
[amok]{.mark} around the world [are **overblown**]{.mark}. Indeed,
[there is **so much friction**]{.mark} between these "friends," **[any
attempt]{.mark}** to team up [would]{.mark} likely **[give both]{.mark}
countries [heat rash]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Siren's Cat Call

[Here's the]{.underline} lame [narrative that's animating the Bismarck
wannabes: The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is
pushing back against Moscow and pressing Beijing. This is driving Moscow
and Beijing closer together. Beijing and Moscow will then
gang-up]{.underline} on the United States. [To prevent this, the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [should make nice with
Moscow (undermining the incipient Sino-Russian détente)]{.underline} and
then focus on beating back against China.

[Yes, China and Russia are going to work together to **some degree**.
They have **important things in common**]{.underline}. For example, both
are unaccountable authoritarian regimes that share the Eurasian
continent. Other indicators of compatibility: they like doing business
with each other, and both like to make up their own rules. Heck, they
don't even have to pretend the liberal world order is a speed-bump in
their joint ventures. Both happily engage with the world's most odious
regimes, from Syria to Venezuela. And, of course, neither has any
compunction about playing dirty when it serves their interests.

[[They]{.underline}]{.mark} already [[play off]{.mark} of each other [to
frustrate]{.mark} foreign-policy initiatives from
[Washington]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, if the United States
pressures Russia to vote a certain way on a measure before the UN
Security Council, Russia will often don the white hat and vote as we
desire, knowing that Beijing will veto the measure for them. Similarly,
if the United States leans on Beijing stop giving North Korea some form
of aid and comfort, Beijing can go along with the request, knowing that
Moscow will pick up the baton for them.

What the neo-Bismarcks need to ask themselves is: **[[Why]{.mark} would
Russia or China [ever]{.mark} consider [giv]{.mark}ing [up]{.mark} these
[practices?]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[Why]{.mark} would they
[make]{.mark} the ongoing great power [competition easier for]{.mark}
the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates[[?]{.mark} That makes **[no
sense]{.mark}**. That is [not]{.mark} in [their
**self-interest**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Any notion that the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[could somehow seduce]{.underline} Russian president Vladimir [Putin
from playing house with Beijing is **fanciful**. Putin **doesn't do
something for nothing**; his price would be **quite high**]{.underline}.
He could demand a free hand in Ukraine, or lifting sanctions, or
squelching opposition to Nordstream II, or giving Russia free rein in
the Middle East. Any of these "deals" would greatly compromise American
interests. Why would we do that? And what, exactly, is Putin going to
deliver in return? What leverage does Russia have on Beijing? The answer
is not near enough to justify any of these concessions.

[On the other hand, what leverage would a Russia-China alliance have on
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates[? [They
wouldn't]{.mark} jointly [threaten]{.mark} Washington with [military
action]{.mark}. A central element of both their strategies is that they
want to win]{.underline} against the United States ["without
fighting."]{.underline}

Moscow might be happy if the United States got distracted in a military
mix-up with China. Conversely, Beijing could okay with the Americans
have an armed confrontation with the Russians. But, [neither of them
will be volunteering to go first anytime soon]{.underline}.

In March of 1969, Chinese troops ambushed and killed a Soviet border
patrol on an island near the Chinese-Russian border. Fighting on and
near the island lasted for months and ended with hundreds of casualties.
Fifty years later, the ferocity of the skirmish between Mao Zedong's
China and Leonid Brezhnev's Soviet Union seems to belong to a very
distant past---so distant, indeed, that [[many]{.mark} foreign-policy
experts [are convinced]{.mark} that [an anti-U.S. alliance]{.mark}
between the two countries [is emerging. Yet]{.mark}]{.underline} even
half a century on, [[such]{.mark} an assessment [stretches]{.mark} the
[ev]{.mark}idence [beyond what it can bear. On closer
inspection]{.mark}, Chinese-Russian economic, foreign policy, and
military [coop]{.mark}eration [is **less than impressive**]{.mark}. The
[history]{.mark} of relations between the two countries [is
**fraught**]{.mark}, and [they play **vastly different roles**]{.mark}
in the world economy, [making]{.mark} a [**divergence** in]{.mark} their
[objectives]{.mark} all but **[unavoidable]{.mark}**. In short,
[reports]{.mark} of a Russian-Chinese alliance [have been **greatly
exaggerated**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

THE ECONOMIC REALITY

[Economic relations]{.underline} between Russia and China [are rapidly
expanding]{.underline}, and some experts have cited these ties as
evidence of a growing closeness between the two countries. Indeed, just
last year, bilateral trade increased by at least 15 percent compared to
2017 and reached a record \$100 billion. [Yet [asymmetries in]{.mark}
the scale and structure of bilateral [commerce suggest
**caution**]{.mark}]{.underline}: although China is Russia's
second-largest trading partner (after the EU) and Russia's largest
individual partner in both exports and imports, for China the Russian
market is at best second-rate. Russia ranks tenth in Chinese exports and
does not make it into the top ten in either imports or total trade.

[The structure of]{.underline} the [[trade is]{.underline}]{.mark}
similarly **[[skewed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. More than three-quarters of
Russia's exports to China are raw materials, specifically crude oil,
wood, and coal. China's sales to Russia are 45 percent consumer goods
and 38 percent electronics and machinery. The completion this year of
the Power of Siberia natural gas pipeline will further widen the
disparity by facilitating the export of \$400 billion worth of Russian
raw materials to China over the next 30 years. The nature of this
exchange corresponds quite closely to Karl Marx's and Vladimir Lenin's
description of colonial trade, in which one country becomes a raw
material appendage of another. It is rare for metropolises to ally
themselves with their colonies.

Russia's and China's [efforts at joint economic development and
investment do not look much like cooperation between]{.underline} two
[eager allies]{.underline}. Even after Moscow's so-called pivot to the
east, spurred by post-Crimea sanctions, from 2014 through 2018 China
directly invested no more than \$24 billion into its northern neighbor's
economy. During the same period, China invested \$148 billion in
sub-Saharan Africa (including \$31 billion in Nigeria alone), and \$88
billion in South America (including \$34 billion just in Brazil). Or
consider the Program of Cooperation in the regions of Far East, Russian
Eastern Siberia, and Chinese North-East in 2009--2018, signed in 2009 by
Chinese President Hu Jintao and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The
initiative included 91 joint investment projects. Six years into the
program, China had financed only 11 of these, while the rest were
delayed, in the words of the Carnegie Moscow Center's Ivan Zuenko, by
"bureaucratic hassles."

[China's parsimony is evident in both the private and public sectors. A
much-heralded plan for the CEFC China Energy company to purchase a 14
percent stake in Russia's largest]{.underline}, and majority
state-owned, [oil company,]{.underline} Rosneft, [fell through. So did a
Chinese]{.underline} government [pledge to invest]{.underline} \$25
billion [in the Power of Siberia pipeline]{.underline}, which cost
Russia \$55 billion. Moscow has celebrated its projected annual delivery
of 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas to China via Power of Siberia
as a big step toward economic interdependence. But to China, the
pipeline is no more than a diversification of the country's energy
sources. In 2017, it imported over 90 billion cubic meters of natural
gas, mostly from Australia, Qatar, and Turkmenistan.

#### Specifically, they have [foreign policy mismatch]{.underline}.

A FOREIGN POLICY MISMATCH

[[Russia and China are **hardly**]{.mark} **any [close]{.mark}r** [in
foreign policy]{.mark} than they are in trade]{.underline}. To be sure,
the two countries stand together in their declared opposition to U.S.
primacy in world affairs. Both advocate a multipolar world and swear to
resist the perceived threat of U.S. intrusion into their spheres of
influence. Beijing and Moscow also see eye to eye with respect to the
threat posed to their regimes by what they see as U.S.-inspired, if not
U.S.-engineered, pro-democracy "color revolutions." They vote almost in
unison at the United Nations.

Yet [away from the global limelight]{.underline} and closer to their
shared Eurasian home, [the two]{.underline} countries [are **hardly
aligned**. [They poach]{.mark} in [each other's **s**]{.mark}pheres
**[o]{.mark}**f **[i]{.mark}**nfluence, [contest]{.mark} each other's
[clients, and reach for each other's]{.mark} **economic and geopolitical
[assets]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[China]{.mark} has [failed to support]{.mark} Russia [in matters of
**great**]{.mark} **geopolitical [importance]{.mark}** to Moscow.
Beijing refused to recognize]{.underline} the independence of [Abkhazia
and South Ossetia after the Russian-**[Georgia]{.mark}**n
war]{.underline} in 2008. [It abstained from]{.underline}, instead of
voting against, [the UN resolution condemning Russia's]{.underline} 2014
[seizure of **[Crimea]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In another symbolic
display that could not have pleased Moscow, President Xi Jinping chose
to inaugurate the 2013 Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Astana, the
capital of Kazakhstan. By choosing to flex Chinese power in the largest
of the former Soviet Central Asian republics---the one that shares the
world's second-longest border with Russia, at 4,250 miles, and is home
to the greatest proportion of ethnic Russians in Central Asia---Xi
flagrantly intruded on Russia's sphere of influence. (A year later,
Putin mused about the fragility of Kazakhstan's statehood during a
question and answer session at Russia's National Youth Forum.) Xi and
Putin later agreed to "coordinat\[e\] cooperation" between the
Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union and Belt and Road. But although some
of the subsequent Chinese- and Kazakh-led infrastructure projects have
been completed, many Russian-led projects have stalled due to financing
and negotiation problems.

For its part, Russia periodically flirts with China's foe, Japan, by
dangling the return of the four Kuril Islands, which the Soviet Union
seized from Japan at the end of World War II and which remain the main
obstacle to a peace treaty between Moscow and Tokyo. In the latest round
of that game, during Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit this past January
to Moscow, Putin, yet again, held out the possibility of normalizing
relations by giving Japan back at least two of the islands, a gesture
that Beijing likely resented, even though it did not lead to a
breakthrough. Russia also exposed tensions with China within the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization---an international body founded by
Moscow and Beijing to promote economic and security cooperation among
its members---when it invited another Chinese rival, India, to join the
group. China tied the score by inviting India's archrival (and the
largest customer for Chinese weapons), Pakistan, to join.

Chinese-Russian military cooperation in particular is often held up as
evidence of a growing closeness. Much has been made of the fact that
Russia has sold China the latest version of its most advanced
antiaircraft S-400 missile defense system. But India, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, and Turkey are next in line for the same equipment. And although
China was the first to buy Russia's most advanced Su-35 jet fighter, it
will not be the last. Indonesia has contracted for 11 jets, Egypt has
purchased dozens more, and India has reportedly considered buying 114
jets. Overall, from 2013 to 2017, India was a far likelier destination
for Russian defense hardware than China, with 35 percent of Russian arms
exports going to New Delhi, compared with 12 percent to Beijing.

Last year's first joint Russian-Chinese land exercise, Vostok-2018,
pointed to an imbalance in military cooperation not unlike the one in
the two countries' bilateral trade. Russia fielded between 75,000 and
100,000 soldiers and 1,000 aircraft; China contributed just 3,200
soldiers and six planes. Mathieu Boulègue of Chatham House argued that
China was invited to participate not so much to bolster an alliance as
to allay any Chinese concerns about the demonstration of force so close
to its borders.

Indeed, the need for strengthening mutual trust between the putative
allies was evident three years before Vostok-2018, during the Kremlin's
search for Internet policing technology. Following a series of
high-level internal consultations, the Kremlin decided to buy data
storage and servers from the telecom giant Huawei. Then, suddenly, the
deal was off. The security services became so alarmed by the likelihood
of Chinese espionage that they dared to challenge the Kremlin's
decision---and, even more surprisingly, managed to reverse it.

THE PUTIN-XI BROMANCE

In the end, the most promising portent of an alliance might be the
personal relationship between the rulers of the two countries. The
Putin-Xi bonhomie extends beyond surface pleasantries. They have met
more than 25 times, far more frequently than either has with any other
head of state. Xi recently called Putin his "best friend," and his first
visit as president was to Moscow. Putin has extolled his relations with
Xi as the finest personal rapport he has with a foreign leader and
fondly recalled celebrating his sixty-first birthday with Xi, over
slices of sausage and shots of vodka, during the Asian-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit in Bali in 2013. Xi presented Putin with China's very
first Order of Friendship, designed to reward foreigners who contributed
"personally to the PRC's cooperation with the world community." Putin
hung a gold chain of the Order of St. Andrew, Russia's highest civilian
award, on Xi's neck.

Sustained mutual affinities between the leaders of great powers almost
always reflect not only overlap in geopolitical objectives but regime
similarities. Both Putin and Xi preside over versions of state
capitalism. Putin's attraction to Xi is not hard to fathom: the Chinese
leader is a fellow authoritarian who controls an enormous economy, which
even in today's downturn posts rates of growth of which Russia can only
dream of. And China does this even while importing huge quantities of
oil and gas.

Xi's alleged respect for Putin likely stems from the Russian president's
deft defusing of several potentially explosive domestic political
problems similar to ones Xi himself has faced. After taking office,
Putin recentralized power within the Russian state, taming the oligarchs
and wiping out the political strongholds of elected governors and
presidents. Then, early in Putin's third term in 2012, as he faced bleak
economic prospects and rapidly declining approval ratings, he rejected
the liberalizing reforms that his minister of finance suggested.
Instead, Putin began to shift the foundation of his regime's legitimacy
from economic progress and income growth to the Kremlin as a defender of
Russia against U.S. aggression and restorer of its past glory as a
global superpower---a formula that the leading Russian political
sociologist Igor Klyamkin has labeled "militarized patriotism."

Concomitantly, Putin cracked down on public displays of dissent, called
for the "patriotic upbringing of the youth," and further intimidated
civil society by signing a law designating many NGOs as "foreign
agents," rendering them social pariahs subject to harassment by the
security and tax authorities. He made the Orthodox Church the guardian
of national mores, and he personally guided the politicization of
history textbooks, which began to whitewash the Soviet experience and
rehabilitate Stalin.

On the road to his own chairmanship---and presidency for life---Xi has
reprised Putin's choices, in spirit if not always letter. He
concentrated policymaking in the office of the party chairman, broke the
baronies of regional party secretaries, and instigated a widespread
"anti-corruption" campaign aimed at eliminating, or intimidating,
potential critics and rivals. He abolished the de facto term limits for
top party and government positions and tightened controls over media and
book publishing.

As Chinese growth rates began to decline, Xi, like his "best friend,"
spurned pro-market reforms and instead opted for his own version of
Putin's militarized patriotism: the reassertion of the Communist Party's
supremacy, the merger of "core socialist values" with "traditions of
Chinese culture," and a war on "spiritual pollution" that has led to
heightened repression in Tibet and Xinjiang.

Similarly, "national rejuvenation" and the pursuit of the "Chinese
dream" became central to the regime's foreign policy discourse. In Xi's
words, China was facing "the most complicated ... external factors in
\[its\] history." Admiral Sun Jianguo, a deputy chief of the General
Staff of the People's Liberation Army, described these factors as
"invasion, subversion," "undermining ... stability," and "interrupting
socialist development." Much as Putin had done, Xi transformed his
country's foreign policy from assertive to aggressively expansionist.
The Chinese leader has militarized territorial disputes in the South and
East China Seas and fortified Chinese-constructed artificial island
chains with missile batteries and aircraft bases.

STILL PREMATURE

[Putin's and Xi's kinship]{.underline} is real and formidable, but [even
it may not be enough to overcome the **obstacles** to a genuine
alliance. One such obstacle is]{.underline} aptly described by a Russian
expression, "istoriya s geografiey." Literally ["a **history with
geography**,"]{.underline} the collocation refers to a seemingly
straightforward matter suddenly turned into something involved and
complicated. [[**History** and]{.mark} **geography** militate against an
entente cordiale between the two Eurasian giants. Authoritarian states
[sharing **a 2,600-mile border**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with much of that
boundary first imposed by imperial Russia on a weaker neighbor, [[are
**hardly ideal**]{.mark}ly set up [to build]{.mark} mutual
[trust]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Reinforcing that barrier are **very significant [structural
differences]{.mark}** []{.mark}between the two countries' **economies**,
which [result in]{.mark} their holding **[divergent stakes]{.mark}** in
the present world economic order. Confined largely to]{.underline}
exporting [oil and gas, [Russia's integration]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the world economy [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} at once quite [secure and
quite [limited]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moscow can afford to rock the boat
and to seek from Beijing a pointedly anti-Western, active, and committed
military-political partnership.

[China's economy]{.underline}, on the other hand, [is the world's second
largest]{.underline}---more than seven times the size of Russia's---with
exports that include advanced communication technologies, cell phones,
computers, and cars. The country's [trade with the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and the
**E**]{.underline}uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion [comes to]{.underline}
at least five [times the value of its Russian account. Because
of]{.underline} its [greater interdependence]{.underline} with other
leading world economies, [[China's]{.mark} system is]{.underline} also
[**far [more vulnerable]{.mark}** to]{.underline} geopolitical
[disruptions]{.underline} than Russia's. And as a greater beneficiary of
the liberal international economic order than Russia, [China is warier
of antagonizing]{.underline} that order's ultimate guarantor, [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. Skillfully promoted
optics notwithstanding, [**[China is not likely to follow]{.mark} Russia
into [an anti-Western]{.mark} geopolitical [crusade]{.mark}**,
preferring to cooperate with its alleged ally on a **more modest**
scale]{.underline} economically and especially militarily.

When I was living in Moscow in the fall of 1969, a rumor circulated
that, returning from Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh's funeral, Chairman
of the Council of Ministers Alexei Kosygin stopped over in the Beijing
airport for talks with his Chinese counterpart, Zhou Enlai. When the
Chinese premier moved to embrace him, Kosygin drew back, saying, "Тhis
is premature."

Apocryphal or not, Kosygin's injunction seems applicable today.
[**Despite claims to the contrary**, the notion of a Chinese-Russian
alliance is **still premature**]{.underline}.

### AT: RCA Impact\-\--China\-\--1AR

#### CCP is [risk averse]{.underline}.

Relations with the Pardee School of Global Affairs at Boston University;

Nevertheless, considered in light of what a true relegation strategy
would entail and the steps China might but has not taken, the
comparatively limited nature of Chinese predation becomes clear. For
one, [[China]{.mark} **[has not increased]{.mark} the rate of its
[military spending]{.mark}** over the last decade even as its economy
has grown]{.underline}; in fact, [Chinese military expenditures remain
below the rates witnessed in both the late Cold War period and in the
early 2000s]{.underline}.39 Likewise, [Chinese [land reclamation]{.mark}
and military deployments in the East and South China Seas **[have only
involved territories previously claimed]{.mark} by the Chinese
government**; China has **[not expanded]{.mark}**]{.underline} [its
maritime [claims]{.mark} so much as taken a unilateral approach toward
resolving existing disputes]{.underline}.40 [[It
has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[done]{.mark} **[little to
strengthen]{.mark} its [nuclear arsenal]{.mark}**]{.underline} [even
though this force **remains vulnerable** to American
disruption.]{.underline}41 Above all, [it has [made **no moves**
to]{.mark} try to [evict the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[from]{.mark} East [Asia]{.mark} by either declaring a sphere of
influence in the region42]{.underline} [or undercutting the U.S.
alliance network]{.underline}.43 In fact, facing suggestions by the
Trump administration that the United States might retrench, [[Chinese
leaders]{.mark} have signaled they [want the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates **[to remain active]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the
area.44 Ultimately, and as other analysts note, [Chinese]{.underline}
efforts contain some [competitive elements]{.underline}, but these
[are]{.underline} also **[notably constrained]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline} their **[scope]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[degree]{.underline}**.45 This strategy makes sense. On one level,
[China's rise has moved it **near the top** of the East Asian pecking
order]{.underline}. A quarter century ago, [China]{.underline} lagged
behind states such as Russia and Japan economically and militarily, but
now its [economy outstrips all states involved in the region except for
the United States.]{.underline}46 The military balance tells a similar
story: [[China is far from a military hegemon]{.underline},]{.mark} [but
given Japan's limited investment in its military]{.underline}, [Russia's
focus on Europe]{.underline} (and friendly relationship with China),
[the still-nascent emergence of India as a regional player, and the
relative weakness of other countries around China's periphery, the
United States is the **principal external security impediment to China's
continued rise**]{.underline}.47 Under these conditions---[absent
another great power competitor]{.underline}---[China **faces
incentives**]{.underline} [to try to shift the distribution of power
further against the United States]{.underline}. By the same measure,
however, [[China's]{.mark} relative [rise from]{.mark} a position of
marked [inferiority]{.mark} vis-à-vis the United States [means
it]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[faces **strong incentives** to **avoid
provoking** the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates too much or too
soon]{.underline}.48 Not only [might]{.underline} [[overly
aggressive]{.mark} Chinese [activities court a war]{.mark} with the
United States]{.underline} that the PRC might well lose, but---even
short of war ---[it [might prompt]{.mark} further U.S. [efforts to
stymie]{.mark} China's continued [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}. Given
these conditions, [Chinese leaders have good reason to embark on a
**slow** and **cautious predatory campaign**]{.underline}---a weakening
strategy---that [tries to shift the distribution of power against the
United States while operating **below a threshold**]{.underline} [that
might catalyze a hostile response]{.underline}. In short, [limited
predation]{.underline}---not an overt and outright push to overtake and
challenge the United States---[is the name of China's current and
**highly rational game**]{.underline}. As significantly, [it appears
Chinese leaders are aware of the structural logic of the
situation.]{.underline} Despite ongoing debate over the extent to which
China has departed from its long-standing "hide strength, bide time"
strategy first formulated by Deng Xiaoping in favor a more assertive
course seeking to increase Chinese influence in world affairs, [Chinese
leaders and China watchers have been at pains to point out that
**[Chinese strategy]{.mark} still [seeks to avoid]{.mark} provoking
[conflict]{.mark} with the United States**]{.underline}.49 As one
analyst notes, [[China's decision]{.mark} to carve out a more prominent
role for itself in world politics [has been coupled with an effort to
**reassure** and **engage**]{.mark} [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
so as **[to avoid unneeded competition]{.mark}**]{.underline} [while
**facilitating stability**]{.underline}.50 [Chinese leaders echo these
themes]{.underline}, with one senior official noting in 2014 that
Chinese policy focused on "properly address\[ing\] conflicts and
differences through dialogue and cooperation instead of confrontational
approaches." 51 [Xi]{.underline} Jinping [himself has underlined these
currents]{.underline}, arguing even before taking office [that
U.S.-Chinese relations should be premised on]{.underline} "**[preventing
conflict and confrontation]{.underline}**," and more recently vowing
that "China will promote coordination and cooperation with other major
countries." 52 Ultimately, as one scholar observes, [[there
is]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[hardly ev]{.mark}idence]{.underline}** that
\[... [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} has\] [[begun]{.underline}]{.mark} to
focus on [[hegemonic competition]{.underline}]{.mark}." 53 Put another
way, [China's leaders appear **aware of the risks** of taking an overly
confrontational stance toward a stillpotent United States and have
scoped Chinese ambitions accordingly.]{.underline}

#### Transition takes [decades]{.underline}.

On its surface, therefore, [power transition theory might appear to be a
compelling basis]{.underline} for predicting the future. [Why, then, is
it **wrong**?]{.underline} [At least **five major factors** undermine
the applicability of the conflict-riven power transition
paradigm]{.underline} to US-China relations. The first refers to the
basic claims of the power shift; the next four deal with the presumed
inevitability of US-China conflict.

[Assessing the validity of power transition requires]{.underline} first
[that [one determine whether]{.mark} or not [an **actual**]{.mark}
**power [transition]{.mark}** [is taking place]{.mark}]{.underline}.
While the differences in relative military and other material strengths
of the US and China have indeed been narrowing, and despite the
Pentagon's concerns over the Chinese military's potential for
anti-access/area-denial (A2AD) capabilities that could deny the US
military free and easy access to China's perimeter, [[it will be decades
before the Chinese military can]{.mark} remotely [gain]{.mark} regional,
let alone [global, parity]{.mark} with its American counterpart, not to
mention the balance when US strength is considered in conjunction with
the military muscularity of its regional allies]{.underline}. Similarly,
[China's GDP may have surpassed that of the US on a PPP basis and will
do so in nominal terms in 10-11 years. But [China's population is four
times larger]{.mark} than America's, [leaving the US with a still much
higher per-capita GDP]{.mark}, the **real measure** of a country's
economic achievement]{.underline}. Being the world's largest economy is
by no means synonymous with being the world's most affluent nation.
Impressive as China's technological advances have been since its 1979
reforms began, [America's innovative edge and lead in information
technology and human resources remains considerable]{.underline}.
Further, the international political, social, educational and cultural
appeal of the Chinese system remains scant while those of [America,
despite its many obvious flaws, retain considerable global
appeal]{.underline}. In short, across multiple dimensions, [China's
overall material and cultural power in no way poses a realistic
challenge to the complex webs now supporting US global and regional
superiority. **[Genuine]{.mark} power [transition]{.mark} between the
two [is inconceivable for decades]{.mark} to come.**]{.underline}

#### No China wars.

**Thompson 17** -- Timothy Heath, a senior international defense
research analyst at the RAND Corporation. William R. Thompson, Political
Science Professor at Indiana University. \[U.S.-China Tensions Are
Unlikely to Lead to War,
https://www.rand.org/blog/2017/05/us-china-tensions-are-unlikely-to-lead-to-war.html\]

Graham Allison\'s April 12 article, "How America and China Could Stumble
to War," explores how misperceptions and bureaucratic dysfunction could
accelerate a militarized crisis involving the United States and China
into an unwanted war. However, the article fails to persuade because it
neglects the key political and geostrategic conditions that make war
plausible in the first place. Without those conditions in place, the
risk that a crisis could accidentally escalate into war becomes far
lower. The U.S.-China relationship today may be trending towards greater
tension, but the [**relative [stability]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} overall **[[low]{.underline}]{.mark}** level
of [[**hostility** make]{.underline}]{.mark} the prospect of an
[**[accidental]{.mark} escalation** to [war]{.mark} **extremely
[unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In a series of scenarios centered around the South China Sea, Taiwan and
the East China Sea, Allison explored how well-established flashpoints
involving China and the United States and its allies could spiral into
unwanted war. Allison's article argues that given the context of
strategic rivalry between a rising power and a status-quo power,
organizational and bureaucratic misjudgments increase the likelihood of
unintended escalation. According to Allison, "the underlying stress
created by China's disruptive rise creates conditions in which
accidental, otherwise inconsequential events could trigger a large-scale
conflict." This argument appears persuasive on its surface, in no small
part because it evokes insights from some of Allison's groundbreaking
work on the organizational pathologies that made the Cuban Missile
Crisis so dangerous.

However, Allison ultimately fails to persuade because he fails to
specify the political and strategic conditions that make war plausible
in the first place. Allison's analysis implies that the United States
and China are in a situation analogous to that of the Soviet Union and
the United States in the early 1960s. In the Cold War example, the two
countries faced each other on a near-war footing and engaged in a bitter
geostrategic and ideological struggle for supremacy. The two countries
experienced a series of militarized crises and fought each other
repeatedly through proxy wars. It was this broader context that made
issues of misjudgment so dangerous in a crisis.

By contrast, the U.S.-China relationship today operates at a much lower
level of hostility and threat. China and the United States may be
experiencing an increase in tensions, but the two countries remain far
from the bitter, acrimonious rivalry that defined the U.S.-Soviet
relationship in the early 1960s. [**[Neither]{.mark} Washington nor
Beijing** [regards the other as]{.mark} **its principal
[enemy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Today's rivals may view each other warily
as competitors and threats on some issues, but they also view each other
as important trade partners and partners on some shared concerns, such
as North Korea, as the recent summit between President Donald Trump and
Chinese president Xi Jinping illustrated. The behavior of their
respective militaries underscores the relatively restrained rivalry. The
military competition between China and the United States may be growing,
but it operates at a far lower level of intensity than the relentless
arms racing that typified the U.S.-Soviet standoff. And unlike their
Cold War counterparts, [**U.S. and Chinese [militaries]{.mark}** [are
not **postured** to **fight**]{.mark} **each other in major
wars**]{.underline}. Moreover, polls show that the people of the two
countries regard each other with mixed views---a considerable contrast
from the hostile sentiment expressed by the U.S. and Soviet publics for
each other. [[Lacking]{.mark} **both preparations** for **major war**
and **a [constituency for conflict]{.mark}**[,
leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} and bureaucracies in both countries [[have
**less incentive** to **misjudge crisis**]{.mark} **situations** in
favor of **unwarranted escalation**]{.underline}.

To the contrary, **[political [leaders]{.mark} and
bureaucracies]{.underline}** currently [face **a strong incentive**
to]{.underline} find ways of **[[defus]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing crises
in a manner that avoids [unwanted [escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
inclination manifested itself in the EP-3 airplane collision off Hainan
Island in 2001, and in subsequent incidents involving U.S. and Chinese
ships and aircraft, such as the harassment of the USNS Impeccable in
2009. This does not mean that there is no risk, however. Indeed, the
potential for a dangerous militarized crisis may be growing. Moreover,
key political and geostrategic developments could shift the incentives
for leaders in favor of more escalatory options in a crisis and thereby
make Allison's scenarios more plausible. Past precedents offer some
insight into the types of developments that would most likely propel the
U.S.-China relationship into a hostile, competitive one featuring an
elevated risk of conflict.

The most important driver, as Allison recognizes, would be a growing
parity between China and the United States as economic, technological
and geostrategic leaders of the international system. The United States
and China feature an increasing parity in the size of their economies,
but [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[retains **a considerable [lead]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} **virtually
[every]{.mark}**]{.underline} other **[[dimension of]{.mark} national
[power]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The current U.S.-China rivalry is a
regional one centered on the Asia-Pacific region, but it retains the
considerable potential of escalating into a global, systemic competition
down the road. A second important driver would be the mobilization of
public opinion behind the view that the other country is a primary
source of threat, thereby providing a stronger constituency for
escalatory policies. A related development would be the formal
designation by leaders in both capitals of the other country as a
primary hostile threat and likely foe. These developments would most
likely be fueled by a growing array of intractable disputes, and further
accelerated by a serious militarized crisis. The cumulative effect would
be the exacerbation of an antagonistic competitive rivalry, repeated and
volatile militarized crisis, and heightened risk that any flashpoint
could escalate rapidly to war---a relationship that would resemble the
U.S.-Soviet relationship in the early 1960s.

Yet even if the relationship evolved towards a more hostile form of
rivalry, unique features of the contemporary world suggest lessons drawn
from the past may have limited applicability. **[[Economic
interdependence]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the twenty-first century is
much different and far more complex than in it was in the past. So is
the lethality of weaponry available to the major powers. In the
sixteenth century, armies fought with pikes, swords and primitive guns.
In the twenty-first century, it is **[[possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to eliminate all life on the planet in a full-bore **[[nuc]{.mark}lear
exchange]{.underline}**. These features likely [[affect]{.mark} the
[willingness]{.mark} of leaders [to escalate]{.mark} in a
crisis]{.underline} in a manner far differently than in past rivalries.

More broadly, Allison's analysis about the "Thucydides Trap" may be
criticized for exaggerating the risks of war. In his claims to identify
a high propensity for war between "rising" and "ruling" countries, he
fails to clarify those terms, and does not distinguish the more
dangerous from the less volatile types of rivalries. [Contests for
supremacy over **land regions**]{.underline}, for example, [have
**historically proven**]{.underline} the most [**conflict-prone**, while
[competition for]{.mark} **supremacy over [maritime]{.mark} regions**
[has]{.mark}]{.underline}, by contrast, [[tended to be **less
lethal**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rivalries also wax and wane over time,
with varying levels of risks of war. A more careful review of rivalries
and their variety, duration and patterns of interaction suggests that
although most wars involve rivalries, many [rivals avoid]{.underline}
going to **[war]{.underline}**.

[[Russian]{.mark} **arms control [violations]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} now

is]{.mark} **linked** to its **military [doctrine]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[and force posture that in turn is [**linked** to]{.mark} **Russian

is]{.underline} quite simply [for the purpose of achieving military
advantages]{.underline}. British Army Gen. Adrian J. Bradshaw, deputy
NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, has voiced concern that Russia
might launch a conventional attack on a weak NATO state, threatening
nuclear escalation to deter a response. Cheating on arms control
agreements is certainly not the only reason why Russian strategic rocket
forces are seeing increases in numbers and capability, but it has
contributed substantially to that growth. Meanwhile, [the military and

[[Since the]{.underline}]{.mark} 19[[70s]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[Russia]{.mark} has [cheated on]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[arms
control]{.mark} agreements]{.underline}, **[clearly
seeing]{.underline}** [this tactic as a **tool** [to gain]{.mark}
**military [advantages]{.mark}** [over the **US**]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
leverage over Russia's [neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many
Administrations, either in hopes of keeping the arms control process
alive or simply not wanting to inflame relations, have looked
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} other way while this was happening, but
[[past]{.mark} precedent [**bodes ill** for **future**]{.mark}
**strategic [dealings]{.mark}** [with **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In violation of its various arms control agreements, [Russia has
developed new strategic nuclear weapons]{.underline}; is building new
strategic bombers; has developed new nuclear-capable sea-launched cruise
missiles; and has moved to make its air defense systems dual-capable,
doubling as treaty-prohibited ground-launched nuclear weapons.

[[Russia shows **no inclination** to **give up this**]{.mark}
**tactic**]{.underline} [and has]{.underline} in fact [stepped
up]{.underline} its [rhetoric]{.underline} that [it will resort to
nuclear weapons]{.underline} [first]{.underline} [if]{.underline} it
feels [threatened]{.underline}.

The first serious government effort to examine the problem didn't occur
until the Reagan Administration. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
informed Congress of "a pattern of Soviet noncompliance" and said the
Soviet Union had violated "its legal obligation under, or political
commitment to, the \[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks I Anti-Ballistic
Missile\] Treaty and Interim Agreement, the SALT II agreement, the
Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963, the Biological and Toxin Weapons
Convention, the Geneva Protocol on Chemical Weapons, and the Helsinki
Final Act. In addition, the USSR has likely violated provisions of the
Threshold Test Ban Treaty."

[Things **didn't improve** when the **Soviet Union went out of
business**]{.underline}. [A 2015 **H**ouse **A**rmed **S**ervices
subcommittee report noted]{.underline}, "The
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n Federation [[is not complying with
**numerous**]{.mark} **treaties** and
**[agreements]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} the
\[**[I]{.underline}**ntermediate-Range **[N]{.underline}**uclear
**[F]{.underline}**orces\] Treaty, the **[Open Skies]{.underline}**
Treaty, [the **B**iological **W**eapons **C**onvention]{.underline},
[the **C**hemical **W**eapons **C**onvention, the **Vienna**

**Istanbul** Commitments]{.underline}, the [**P**residential **N**uclear

**C**ontrol **R**egime]{.underline}." It also stated that Russia had
withdrawn from [the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe
(**CFE**]{.underline}).

The evidence indicates that such [[violations **aren't
accident**]{.mark}**s**, **one time incidents**, **misunderstandings**,
[or **legitimate**]{.mark} **disputes**]{.underline} [over]{.underline}
treaty [interpretation]{.underline}, [and they are often]{.underline}
quite [**militarily significant**. [If **a**]{.mark} **legal or
political [commitment]{.mark}** [hinders **an**]{.mark} **important
Russian [objective]{.mark}**, it tends to be [**ignored**.
Cheating]{.mark} can [result in **numerical advantages**]{.mark},
**[more]{.mark} effective [weapons]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark}]{.underline}
in some cases, **[[lower costs]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Unlike Russia, the US has long and optimistically viewed arms control as
a way to reduce the probability and destructiveness of conflict. In
November 1975, British strategist Colin S. Gray wrote in Air Force
Magazine that the Soviets conducted arms control negotiations in "a
fairly crudely combative way." [Russia]{.underline}, he said, [saw arms
control as a "**political struggle**]{.underline}." Absent a response,
[cheating gives Russia **military advantages**]{.underline}.

NUCLEAR THREATS

Soviet/Russian military doctrine allowed for the first use of nuclear
weapons in conventional war, and today Russia threatens nuclear attacks.
In June 2015, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert O. Work and then-Vice
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr. told
Congress, "Russian military doctrine includes what some have called an
'escalate to de-escalate' strategy---\[one\] that purportedly seeks to
de-escalate a conventional conflict through coercive threats, including
limited nuclear use," a policy they described as "playing with fire."

Russia's nuclear doctrine affects its policy on nuclear reductions, arms
control, and compliance. [Willingness to use]{.underline} nuclear
[weapons provides]{.underline} the **[motive]{.underline}** for
resisting nuclear arms cuts and [for cheating]{.underline}. Indeed,
during Russia's New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ratification
process, its defense minister said Russia intended to increase its
strategic nuclear forces. Since New START entered into force in 2011,
Russia increased its deployed warheads, deployed delivery vehicles, and
deployed and nondeployed delivery vehicles, reaching 1,735 deployed
warheads by March 2016, an increase of 198.

Since the signing of New START in 2010, Russia has refused to negotiate
deeper cuts in strategic nuclear weapons or limits on tactical nuclear
weapons. In a Russian newspaper interview in 2013, Sergei B. Ivanov,
Kremlin chief of staff, explained why: "When I hear our American
partners say, 'Let's reduce something else,' I would like to say to
them, 'Excuse me, but what we have is relatively new.'" The Americans,
he said, "have not conducted any upgrades for a long time. They still
use Trident \[missiles\]."

[Failure to call Russia out on cheating **increases**]{.underline} its
[**incentive** to do it, and American officials have long been reticent
to challenge Russia on its violations or respond]{.underline} to them.
With the exception of the Reagan Administration's 1986 termination of US
observance of the SALT I and II agreements in response to multiple
Soviet violations, [there's been **no** substantive **US response** to
Russian violations]{.underline}.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea violate a
number of arms control and international security agreements. Secretary
of State John F. Kerry said, "The United States condemns the Russian
Federation's invasion and occupation of Ukrainian territory and its
violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity in full
contravention of Russia's obligations under the UN Charter, the Helsinki
Final Act, its 1997 military basing agreement with Ukraine, and the
1994Budapest Memorandum." The Budapest Memorandum was a condition for
the START entry-into-force and the denuclearization of Ukraine.

The Obama Administration also says Russia is violating the CFE Treaty,
which was intended to limit the amount of conventional military forces
in Europe. This is particularly significant in light of Russia's
aggression against Ukraine and the ensuing European crisis. But even
before Moscow suspended its obligations under the CFE Treaty in 2007, it
had been in violation of its terms. Russia actually admitted this in
1999, according the the Arms Control Association. In March 2015, TASS
news agency reported that Anatoly I. Antonov, deputy defense minister,
said the CFE Treaty "is dead and there are no prospects for reviving
it." A month later, TASS quoted Anton Mazur, the head of the Russian
delegation at the Vienna talks on military security and arms control, as
saying that while Russia "formally remains \[a\]party of the CFE Treaty
\... there will be no return to the treaty." There's no legal basis for
Russia's long-term refusal to comply with CFE while remaining a party to
it.

By increasing the level of forces arrayed against parts of Europe,
Russia's violation of the CFE Treaty has enhanced its military
capability against some NATO states. Russia's suspension of CFE
inspections reportedly blocked information about its preparations to
attack Georgia in 2008.

The most common Soviet/Russian arms control violations have involved the
nuclear treaties that were the focus of bilateral arms control. [The
[**full scope** of **Russian noncompliance** is
**not**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the **[[public]{.underline}]{.mark}**
domain [because [there's **only** been **one**]{.mark} comprehensive and
**[unclassified]{.mark}** compliance [report]{.mark} **since**
1993]{.underline}. US law, however, requires an annual report with "a
specific identification, to the maximum extent practicable in
unclassified form," of each potential violation of an arms treaty.

Pinker agrees that [[there is]{.mark} **plenty of
[time]{.mark}**]{.underline} to plan [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} all
conceivable [[**contingencies** and]{.underline}]{.mark} build
**[[safeguards]{.underline}]{.mark}** into our AI systems. [\"They would

than these machines, but Pinker reminds us of the AI hyperbole we\'ve
been fed for decades: \"The worry that an AI system would be so clever
at attaining one of the goals programmed into it (like commandeering
energy) that it would run roughshod over the others (like human safety)
assumes that AI will descend upon us faster than we can design fail-safe
precautions. The reality is that [[progress]{.mark} in AI [is]{.mark}
**hype-defyingly [slow]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [[there will

CEO Eric Schmidt agrees, responding to the fears expressed by Hawking
and Musk this way: \"Don\'t you think the humans would notice this, and
start turning off the computers?\" He also noted the irony in the fact
that Musk has invested \$1 billion into a company called OpenAI that is
\"promoting precisely AI of the kind we are describing.\"23 Google\'s
own DeepMind has developed the concept of an AI off-switch, playfully
described as a \"big red button\" to be pushed in the event of an
attempted AI takeover. \"We have proposed a framework to allow a human
operator to repeatedly safely interrupt a reinforcement learning agent
while making sure the agent will not learn to prevent or induce these
interruptions,\" write the authors Laurent Orseau from DeepMind and
Stuart Armstrong from the Future of Humanity Institute, in a paper
titled \"Safely Interruptible Agents.\" They even suggest a
precautionary scheduled shutdown every night at 2 AM for an hour so that
both humans and AI are accustomed to the idea. [[\"**Safe
interruptibility** can]{.underline}]{.mark} be useful to take
[[control]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[a robot that is
misbehaving]{.underline}]{.mark} and may lead to irreversible
consequences, or to take it out of a delicate situation, or even to
temporarily use it to achieve a task it did not learn to perform or
would not normally receive rewards for this.\"24 As well, it is good to
keep in mind that artificial intelligence is not the same as artificial
consciousness. Thinking machines may not be sentient machines. Finally,
Andrew Ng of Baidu responded to Elon Musk\'s ASI concerns by noting (in
a jab at the entrepreneur\'s ambitions for colonizing the red planet) it
would be \"like worrying about overpopulation on Mars when we have not
even set foot on the planet yet.\"25 Both utopian and [[dystopian
visions]{.underline}]{.mark} of AI [[are]{.mark} **based on [a
projection]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the future quite unlike anything
history has given us. Yet, even Ray Kurzweil\'s \"law of accelerating
returns,\" as remarkable as it has been has nevertheless advanced at a
pace that has allowed for considerable ethical deliberation with
appropriate checks and balances applied to various technologies along
the way. With time, even if an unforeseen motive somehow began to emerge
in an AI [[we would]{.underline}]{.mark} have the time to **[[reprogram
it]{.mark} before it got out of control]{.underline}**. That is also the
judgment of Alan Winfield, an engineering professor and co-author of the
Principles of Robotics, a list of rules for regulating robots in the
real world that goes far beyond Isaac Asimov\'s famous three laws of
robotics (which were, in any case, designed to fail as plot devices for
science fictional narratives).26 Winfield points out that
[[all]{.underline}]{.mark} of these [doomsday [scenarios depend

#### No robopocalypse.

**Pinker 18** Steven Arthur Pinker is a Canadian-American cognitive
psychologist, Professor at Harvard University. \[Enlightenment Now: The
Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, Viking, Penguin
Group\]

Prominent among the existential risks that supposedly threaten the
future of humanity is a 21st-century version of the Y2K bug. This is the
danger that we will be subjugated, intentionally or accidentally, by
artificial intelligence (AI), a disaster sometimes called the
Robopocalypse and commonly illustrated with stills from the Terminator
movies. As with Y2K, some smart people take it seriously. Elon Musk,
whose company makes artificially intelligent self-driving cars, called
the technology "more dangerous than nukes." Stephen Hawking, speaking
through his artificially intelligent synthesizer, warned that it could
"spell the end of the human race."19 But among the smart people who
aren't losing sleep are most experts in artificial intelligence and most
experts in human intelligence.20 The [[Robopocalypse is]{.mark} based on
a **[muzzy]{.mark} conception** of intelligence that owes more
to]{.underline} the Great Chain of Being and [a Nietzschean will to
power than]{.underline} to a [modern scientific
understanding]{.underline}.21 In this conception, intelligence is an
all-powerful, wish-granting potion that agents possess in different
amounts. Humans have more of it than animals, and an artificially
intelligent computer or robot of the future ("an AI," in the new
count-noun usage) will have more of it than humans. Since we humans have
used our moderate endowment to domesticate or exterminate less
well-endowed animals (and since technologically advanced societies have
enslaved or annihilated technologically primitive ones), it follows that
a supersmart AI would do the same to us. Since an AI will think millions
of times faster than we do, and use its superintelligence to recursively
improve its superintelligence (a scenario sometimes called "foom," after
the comic-book sound effect), from the instant it is turned on we will
be powerless to stop it.22 But [the scenario makes]{.underline} about
[as much sense as the worry that since jet planes have surpassed the
flying ability of eagles, someday they will swoop out of the sky and
seize our cattle. The first fallacy is]{.underline} a **[confusion of
intelligence with motivation]{.underline}**---of beliefs with desires,
inferences with goals, thinking with wanting. Even if we did invent
superhumanly intelligent robots, [why would they want to]{.underline}
enslave their masters or [take over the world?]{.underline} Intelligence
is the ability to deploy novel means to attain a goal. But the [[goals
are **extraneous** to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[intelligence:]{.mark}
being smart is not the same as wanting something]{.underline}. It just
so happens that the intelligence in one system, Homo sapiens, is a
product of Darwinian natural selection, an inherently competitive
process. In the brains of that species, reasoning comes bundled (to
varying degrees in different specimens) with goals such as dominating
rivals and amassing resources. But [[it's a **mistake** to
**confuse**]{.underline}]{.mark} a circuit in [**[the limbic
brain]{.mark}** of a]{.underline} certain species of [primate
[with]{.mark} the]{.underline} very [**nature of
[intelligence]{.mark}**[. An **a**]{.mark}]{.underline}rtificially
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligent system that was designed rather
than evolved [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} just as easily [[think
like]{.underline}]{.mark} shmoos, the blobby
**[[altruists]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Al Capp's comic strip Li'l
Abner, [who]{.underline} deploy their considerable ingenuity to
[**barbecue themselves** for the benefit of human]{.underline}
eater[s]{.underline}. There is no law of complex systems that says that
intelligent agents must turn into ruthless conquistadors. Indeed, we
know of one highly advanced form of intelligence that evolved without
this defect. They're called women. The second fallacy is to think of
intelligence as a boundless continuum of potency, a miraculous elixir
with the power to solve any problem, attain any goal.23 The fallacy
leads to nonsensical questions like when an AI will "exceed human-level
intelligence," and to the image of an ultimate "Artificial General
Intelligence" (AGI) with God-like omniscience and omnipotence.
Intelligence is a contraption of gadgets: software modules that acquire,
or are programmed with, knowledge of how to pursue various goals in
various domains.24 People are equipped to find food, win friends and
influence people, charm prospective mates, bring up children, move
around in the world, and pursue other human obsessions and pastimes.
Computers may be programmed to take on some of these problems (like
recognizing faces), not to bother with others (like charming mates), and
to take on still other problems that humans can't solve (like simulating
the climate or sorting millions of accounting records). The problems are
different, and the kinds of knowledge needed to solve them are
different. Unlike Laplace's demon, the mythical being that knows the
location and momentum of every particle in the universe and feeds them
into equations for physical laws to calculate the state of everything at
any time in the future, a real-life knower has to acquire information
about the messy world of objects and people by engaging with it one
domain at a time. Understanding does not obey Moore's Law: knowledge is
acquired by formulating explanations and testing them against reality,
not by running an algorithm faster and faster.25 Devouring the
information on the Internet will not confer omniscience either: [[big
data is]{.underline}]{.mark} still **[[finite]{.mark}
data]{.underline}**, and [[the universe]{.underline}]{.mark} of
knowledge [[is **infinite**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For these reasons,
many AI researchers are annoyed by the latest round of hype (the
perennial bane of AI) which has misled observers into thinking that
Artificial General Intelligence is just around the corner.26 As far as I
know, [[there are **no projects**]{.mark} to build an AGI]{.underline},
not just because [[it would be **commercially
dubious**]{.underline}]{.mark} but because [[the concept is **barely
coherent**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The 2010s have, to be sure, brought us
systems that can drive cars, caption photographs, recognize speech, and
beat humans at Jeopardy!, Go, and Atari computer games. But the advances
have not come from a better understanding of the workings of
intelligence but from the brute-force power of faster chips and bigger
data, which allow the programs to be trained on millions of examples and
generalize to similar new ones. **[[Each system is]{.mark} an idiot
savant [\[a one trick pony\]]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with little ability
to leap to problems it was not set up to solve, and a brittle mastery of
those it was. A photo-captioning program labels an impending plane crash
"An airplane is parked on the tarmac"; a game-playing program is
flummoxed by the slightest change in the scoring rules.27 Though the
programs will surely get better, there are no signs of foom. Nor have
any of these programs made a move toward taking over the lab or
enslaving their programmers. Even if an AGI tried to exercise a will to
power, [[without]{.underline}]{.mark} the [cooperation of [humans it
would remain]{.mark} **[a]{.mark}n impotent [brain in a
vat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The computer scientist Ramez Naam deflates
the bubbles surrounding foom, a technological Singularity, and
exponential self-improvement: Imagine that you are a superintelligent AI
running on some sort of microprocessor (or perhaps, millions of such
microprocessors). In an instant, you come up with a design for an even
faster, more powerful microprocessor you can run on. Now . . . drat! You
have to actually manufacture those microprocessors. And those fabs
\[fabrication plants\] take tremendous energy, they take the input of
materials imported from all around the world, they take highly
controlled internal environments which require airlocks, filters, and
all sorts of specialized equipment to maintain, and so on. All of this
takes time and energy to acquire, transport, integrate, build housing
for, build power plants for, test, and manufacture. The real world has
gotten in the way of your upward spiral of self-transcendence.28 [The
real world gets in the way of]{.underline} many [digital apocalypses.
When HAL gets uppity, Dave disables it with a screwdriver]{.underline},
leaving it pathetically singing "A Bicycle Built for Two" to itself. Of
course, one can always imagine a Doomsday Computer that is malevolent,
universally empowered, always on, and tamperproof. The way to deal with
this threat is straightforward: don't build one. As the prospect of evil
robots started to seem too kitschy to take seriously, a new digital
apocalypse was spotted by the existential guardians. This storyline is
based not on Frankenstein or the Golem but on the Genie granting us
three wishes, the third of which is needed to undo the first two, and on
King Midas ruing his ability to turn everything he touched into gold,
including his food and his family. The danger, sometimes called the
Value Alignment Problem, is that we might give an AI a goal and then
helplessly stand by as it relentlessly and literal-mindedly implemented
its interpretation of that goal, the rest of our interests be damned. If
we gave an AI the goal of maintaining the water level behind a dam, it
might flood a town, not caring about the people who drowned. If we gave
it the goal of making paper clips, it might turn all the matter in the
reachable universe into paper clips, including our possessions and
bodies. If we asked it to maximize human happiness, it might implant us
all with intravenous dopamine drips, or rewire our brains so we were
happiest sitting in jars, or, if it had been trained on the concept of
happiness with pictures of smiling faces, tile the galaxy with trillions
of nanoscopic pictures of smiley-faces.29 I am not making these up.
These are the [[scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} that supposedly
illustrate the existential threat to the human species of advanced
artificial intelligence. They [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}, fortunately,
**[[self-refuting]{.underline}]{.mark}**.30 [[They depend
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[premises]{.mark} that]{.underline} (1)
[[humans]{.underline}]{.mark} are [**[so gifted]{.mark}** that
[they]{.mark} can [design]{.mark} [an **omniscient**]{.mark} **and
omnipotent [AI]{.mark}**[, yet so]{.mark} **moronic \[[dense]{.mark}\]**
that [they would]{.mark} give it **[control]{.mark} of [the universe
without testing]{.mark}** how it works, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} (2)
[the [AI]{.mark} would be **so brilliant** that it
[could]{.mark}]{.underline} figure out how to [**[transmute

\[[silly]{.mark}\]** that [it would wreak havoc based on]{.mark}
**elementary blunders of [misunderstanding]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
ability to choose an action that best satisfies conflicting goals is not
an add-on to intelligence that engineers might slap themselves in the
forehead for forgetting to install; it is intelligence. So is the
ability to interpret the intentions of a language user in context. [Only
in a]{.underline} television [comedy]{.underline} like Get Smart [does a
robot respond to]{.underline} "Grab the waiter" by hefting the maître d'
over his head, or ["Kill the light" by pulling out a pistol and shooting
it.]{.underline} When we put aside fantasies like foom, digital
megalomania, instant omniscience, and perfect control of every molecule
in the universe, **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**rtificial
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} like
any other technology. It is [[developed
**incrementally**]{.underline}]{.mark}, designed to satisfy multiple
conditions, tested before it is implemented, and constantly tweaked
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} efficacy and
**[[safety]{.underline}]{.mark}** (chapter 12). As the AI expert Stuart
Russell puts it, "No one in civil engineering talks about 'building
bridges that don't fall down.' They just call it 'building bridges.'"
Likewise, he notes, AI that is beneficial rather than dangerous is
simply AI.31

### AT: Asia\-\--1AR 

#### No Sino-Indo war.

**Singh 20** -- Ameya Pratap Singh is a DPhil student in South Asia at
the University of Oxford. \[Why Another Sino-Indian War Is Unlikely,
6-1-20,
https://thediplomat.com/2020/06/why-another-sino-indian-war-is-unlikely/\]

However, [contrary to **widespread fears**, another Sino-Indian [war is
**unlikely**]{.mark}]{.underline} to be in the offing. [[In]{.mark}
**the [shadow of nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}**, a limited
conventional war]{.underline} on the Sino-Indian border --- somewhat
akin to the month-long clash in 1962 -- [can be **avoided**]{.underline}
for several reasons.

First, this is because of the nature of the dispute and the lack of
ideological fundamentalism and issue indivisibility. Unlike the United
States, which has increasingly begun to view the geopolitical
competition with China as a battle for values such as freedom of
navigation or democracy or the preservation of the liberal international
order, [India and China do not see each other through]{.underline} such
[**an ideological lens**. The authoritarian regime of the
C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunity [P]{.underline}arty [is not
perceived to be **antithetical** to India's democratic
character]{.underline}, and vice versa. India's long-term strategy, as
former Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale puts it, is to retain its
strategic autonomy, and pursue alignments based "on issues, not
ideology."

Hence, while [both parties]{.underline} have been cautious of each
other's maneuvers on the border, they [have refrained from
linking]{.underline} these to **[existential attributes of national
identity]{.underline}**, which are notorious for inflating the
significance of disputed territories --- for example in the case of
Kashmir, Tibet, or Taiwan. In fact, Beijing has long held that the
border dispute is a remnant of British colonialism and its reckless
cartographic practices, rather than being driven by India's territorial
expansionism. On the Indian side, Army Chief General Manoj Mukund
Naravane, in a break from traditional bouts of recrimination between
adversaries, accepted that due to differing notions of the LAC, "both
sides" were guilty of aggressive behavior in Eastern Ladakh and North
Sikkim. This choice of words effectively yielded the use of any
victimhood narratives that could be mobilized to create moral
justification for retaliatory action.

Second, [the [risks of]{.mark} **inadvertent [pre-emption]{.mark}**
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly as
[[high]{.underline}]{.mark} as they were in 1962, when Nehru's ill-fated
"forward policy" was met by overwhelming Chinese military force. This is
because of a series of five [agreements signed between India and China
to address]{.underline} disputes arising over the LAC: 1) the [1993
Agreement]{.underline} on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility along
the LAC; 2) the [1996 Agreement on
C]{.underline}onfidence-[B]{.underline}uilding
[M]{.underline}easure[s]{.underline} in the Military Field Along the
LAC, 3) [the 2005 Protocol]{.underline} on Modalities for the
Implementation of Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field
Along the LAC; 4) [the 2012 Agreement]{.underline} on the Establishment
of a Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China
Border Affairs; [and]{.underline} 5) [the 2013 Border]{.underline}
Defense Cooperation [Agreement]{.underline}.

These [agreements provide **a modus operandi** for **diplomatic
engagement** at **the military and political levels**, as well as **a
set of "status quo" commitments** both sides can return to in case of
escalation. They proved **effective** during the 16-day stand-off
between]{.underline} Indian and Chinese forces [in]{.underline} eastern
Ladakh near the village of [Chumar, the military
confrontation]{.underline} at Burtse in the Depsang plains in northern
[Ladakh in 2015, and the Doklam crisis in 2017]{.underline}.

Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava has
also affirmed New Delhi's intention to de-escalate the current stand-off
based on these agreements. He stated that "the two sides \[already\]
have established mechanisms to resolve such situations peacefully
through dialogue." Similarly, the Chinese official statement also
reiterated Beijing's commitment "to uphold peace and tranquility in
border areas." [**Summit [diplomacy]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} **likely [to
return]{.mark}** [if]{.mark} the [crisis escalates]{.mark}
further]{.underline}.

Third is [**the element of [ambiguity]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **the
["fog"]{.mark}** [surround]{.mark}ing the details of **the military
[stand-off]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Typically, analysts have viewed
"nationalist strongmen" as promoters of aggressive state behavior. But,
[in this case]{.underline}, the ability of [both
governments]{.underline} to control national media, and the
inscrutability of the facts related to the dispute, [aided efforts to
manage **domestic audience costs**]{.underline}. For instance, media
reports of 15-20 personnel of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police force being
detained by the Chinese were categorically refuted by the Indian side.
[This [meant]{.mark}]{.underline} that [**[no domestic pressure for
retal]{.mark}iation** arose [and **no**]{.mark} **great [reputational
damage]{.mark}** was suffered]{.underline}. In the aftermath of the
Doklam crisis, similar [[ambiguity allowed both]{.mark} sides [to
claim]{.mark} **tactical [victories]{.mark}**]{.underline} for
themselves [[and **diffuse**]{.mark} the situation
successfully]{.underline}. In India, criticism has been incrementally
rising with respect to the Modi government's lack of transparency on the
matter, but it is unlikely to reach electorally harmful proportions.

Lastly, [**the material [costs]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **limited
[war]{.mark}** for both parties **far [outweigh]{.mark}** potential
[gains]{.mark}]{.underline}. For [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, conflict
on the border with India [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} diminish its
ability to [[meet]{.underline}]{.mark} key security challenges in the
South China Sea, thus making it vulnerable to [the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, which
Beijing considers its primary security competitor. [It seems
**unlikely**]{.underline} that [Beijing would]{.underline} want to [risk
**a two-front war**]{.underline}. Additionally, [[**reputational
damages** suffered due to **COVID**]{.mark}**-19**, **pre-existing
[fears]{.mark}** [surrounding]{.mark} China's [rise, and India's]{.mark}
**conventional and nuclear deterrence [capabilities]{.mark}** will all
[temper **Beijing's**]{.mark} **pre-emptive use of military
[force]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Similarly, [for India, **the primary
security challenge** remains Pakistan]{.underline}-based terrorist
infiltration on the Kashmir border. More importantly, beyond the
protection of vital strategic points on either side that allow military
forces to effectively defend and patrol their territories in challenging
high-altitude mountainous regions, [the vast tracts of disputed
land]{.underline} along the LAC [do not hold **any important material
resources**]{.underline} such as oil, precious mineral reserves, or
ethnic-kin populations. [The benefits of **territorial aggrandizement**
are]{.underline} therefore, [limited to **deterrence
value**]{.underline} and [**the natural terrain** offers **few
advantages** to offensive forces]{.underline}.

#### [Doklam crisis]{.underline}, [self-interest]{.underline}, and [US-Indo drift]{.underline} dampen conflict.

[While]{.underline} Sino-Indian [[friction will continue,
relations]{.mark} have [improved]{.mark}]{.underline} from last year's

what Yun Sun has described as "strategic contempt" and hubris towards
India. Since Doklam, anecdotal evidence suggests Beijing has sought to
correct this bias by allotting greater resources to the analysis of
South Asia. [[China]{.mark} may [better appreciate]{.mark} **Indian
[sensitivities]{.mark}**, **local [capabilities]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark}
**the Modi government's [resolve]{.mark}**[, reducing]{.mark} **risks of
[miscalc]{.mark}ulation**. [Doklam]{.mark}]{.underline} likely
[[reminded Delhi of]{.mark} **its periphery's
[vulnerabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Despite initial triumphalism,
Indian strategic discourse has grasped that victory at Doklam was
tactical, provoked greater Chinese fortifications, and failed to restore
the status quo. The standoff exposed Delhi's lack of even 10 days of
ammunition reserves and a functioning sea-based deterrent. After staring
into the abyss, [[both]{.mark} sides]{.underline} may have [decided
to]{.underline} reevaluate each other's positions, [[avoid provocations,
and navigate frictions with **caution**]{.mark} **rather than false
optimism**. National [self-interest in **economics** and
**geopolitics**]{.mark}]{.underline} can also [[bolster]{.mark} **stable
[relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For an underperforming Indian economy
facing "jobless growth," China offers perhaps the largest source of new
foreign direct investment (FDI) to India, totaling \$8 billion last
year. Recently, China has appeared willing to drop barriers to reduce
the trade deficit with India. [Chinese FDI combined with capacity
transfer can]{.underline} also [stimulate Indian
manufacturing]{.underline}. Another border standoff might foreclose on
such opportunities as it did during Doklam, when Chinese investment was
delayed or deterred. India entering an election year further
incentivizes avoiding conflict that could be economically damaging.
[[Engagement with China]{.underline}]{.mark} instead of strident
opposition [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[dampen]{.mark}
geopolitical [competition in India's]{.mark} own [backyard, which may
afford]{.mark} Delhi [**consultations** or]{.mark} **geopolitical
[bargaining]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One senior official privately
remarked that India could have leveraged approval of China's Belt and
Road Initiative for Chinese backing of Indian overland access to
Afghanistan. Similarly, [[China could benefit strategically from
leveraging]{.mark} concessions]{.underline} in India's neighborhood [[to
subvert **India**]{.mark}**n integration into [U.S.]{.mark}-led
[alliance]{.mark} systems**]{.underline} in Asia. Since Beijing was
concerned by Delhi's seeming gravitation towards a U.S.-led military
alliance, [the perceived deceleration of the U.S.-India strategic
relationship reduces tensions]{.underline} that fueled Doklam. Though
rhetorically strong, the relationship's substance---including arms
sales, technology transfers, interoperability, investment, and joint
operations---has been erratic and slow-moving, leading to [talk of
["India fatigue" in the Pentagon]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Drift
stems from several sources. Structurally, India's Cold War distrust,
risk-averse bureaucracy, and governments engrossed with endless election
cycles constrain transformational foreign policy. U.S. preoccupation
with Afghanistan also constrains nimble innovation in its Indo-Pacific
strategy. Moreover, the current administration has injected new
uncertainties, particularly over the credibility of U.S. commitments,
encouraging Indian hedging and buck-passing. Though perhaps distressing
from an American standpoint, U.S.-India drift, along with lessons
learned and a hard reappraisal of national self-interest, [[may ensure
**stable**]{.mark} **China-India [relations]{.mark}**
[prevail]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### No coercion impact. 

**NR 17**, Nonproliferation Review, refereed journal concerned with the
causes, consequences, and control of the spread of nuclear, chemical,
and biological weapons, 2017, "Nuclear coercion skepticism and Russia\'s
nuclear-tinged threats,"
<https://doi.org/10.1080/10736700.2018.1431178>, jy

An analysis of Russian President Vladimir [Putin\'s
statements]{.underline} could [suggest]{.underline} that [he may be a
**skeptic**]{.underline} [when it comes to]{.underline} nuclear
**[coercion]{.underline}**. Much has been made of Putin\'s remark during
an interview for a Russian television documentary that he considered
putting nuclear weapons on alert during Crimea. Some have suggested that
the remark itself was Putin messaging to a Western audience.3 What seems
to be lost in the discussion is that, despite concerns about a Western
intervention, [he did not]{.underline}, in fact, [put nuclear weapons on
alert]{.underline}. A more careful look at the transcript also suggests
that [he was much more focused on the **conventional
aspects**]{.underline} of the conflict and highlighting the importance
of Russia\'s developing conventional capabilities. In his responses,
Putin was explicit that deploying conventional capabilities would make
Crimea a conventional \"fortress,\" individually listing the K-300P
Bastion-P coastal defense missile system, Buk and S-300 air defense
systems, and others deployed there. Only when the interviewer asks,
\"Does this mean that we increased the military readiness of our nuclear
forces?\" Putin briefly notes that \"We were ready to do this.\" He then
continues to argue that Russia was provoked into the conflict, and notes
that Russia\'s stakes were significantly higher than those of the West.4
Thus, while nuclear references may have led the headlines in both Russia
and the West, Putin\'s own words focused much more on the conventional
dimension.

Additional hints about the [limits of nuclear weapons in Russian
thinking are **evident**]{.underline} in military writings that focus on
the role of conventional capabilities in deterrence and escalation
control. One notable example is [Russia\'s]{.underline} concept of
[\"forceful\" \"non-nuclear deterrence,\" which envisages signaling
via]{.underline} limited **[conventional precision]{.underline}**
strikes on select targets. This concept grew directly out of concerns
about the low credibility of nuclear threats at early stages of
conflicts and the potential danger of uncontrolled nuclear escalation
that could follow limited nuclear use.5

What of Russia\'s nuclear saber rattling and brinkmanship in the broader
Ukraine crisis? A cursory assessment appears to reinforce Sechser and
Fuhrmann\'s point about the difficulty of signaling in ways that an
opponent clearly understands. In fact, [Moscow\'s signaling was **so
confusing**]{.underline} that many [analysts had a difficult time
figuring out not only Russia\'s aims but whether it had achieved
them.]{.underline}

Israeli analyst Dima Adamsky wrote that

> Russian signaling of unacceptable damage and intolerable escalation
> \[around the Ukraine conflict\] aimed to demoralize the adversaries,
> to discredit Western extended deterrence, to dissuade a more direct
> Western involvement, to deter or downgrade Western conventional
> response reinforcements, and to coerce adversaries into accepting
> Moscow\'s worldview.6

In retrospect, [Russia\'s coercive efforts]{.underline}---as defined by
Adamsky---[do **not** appear to have met with great
success]{.underline}. Similarly, after an extensive analysis of Russian
signaling and a discussion of potential motivations, Polish analyst
Jacek Durkalec concluded that, \"[while Russia\'s nuclear saber-rattling
has had an influence]{.underline} on the Ukraine crisis by defining its
limits, [it is hard to assess with certainty the **real
impact**]{.underline}.\"7

https://www.csis.org/analysis/dismissing-cyber-catastrophe

More importantly, [there are powerful]{.underline} **[strategic
constraints]{.underline}** [on those who have]{.underline} the [ability
to launch **catastrophe attacks**. We have more]{.underline} than two
[decades of experience with the use of]{.underline} **[cyber
techniques]{.underline}** and operations for coercive and criminal
purposes [and have a]{.underline} **[clear understanding]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} [**motives**, **capabilities**, and
**intentions**]{.underline}. We can be guided by the methods of the
Strategic Bombing Survey, which used interviews and observation (rather
than hypotheses) to determine effect. These methods apply equally to
cyberattacks. The conclusions we can draw from this are:

[[**Nonstate actors** and]{.mark} **most [states]{.mark}** [lack]{.mark}
the [capability to]{.mark} launch attacks that [cause]{.mark} **physical
[damage]{.mark} at any level, [much less]{.mark} a
[catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [There have been regular
predictions every year]{.underline} for over a decade [that nonstate
actors will acquire these]{.underline} high-end cyber capabilities [in
two or three years]{.underline} in what has become a cycle of
repetition. [The monetary]{.underline} [**return is negligible**, which
**dissuades** the skilled cybercriminals]{.underline} (mostly Russian
speaking) [who might have the necessary skills]{.underline}. One mystery
is why these groups have not been used as mercenaries, and this may
reflect either a degree of control by the Russian state (if it has
forbidden mercenary acts) or a degree of caution by criminals.

[[There is **enough uncertainty**]{.mark} among potential attackers
[about]{.mark} the **U**nited **S**tates' [ability to
**attribute**]{.mark}]{.underline} [that [they are]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[unwilling to risk]{.mark} massive [retaliation]{.mark}** in
response]{.underline} to a catastrophic attack. (They are perfectly
willing to take the risk of attribution for espionage and coercive cyber
actions.)

[[No one has]{.mark} ever [died from]{.mark} a [cyber]{.mark}attack, and
only a handful]{.underline} of these attacks have [produced physical
damage. A cyberattack is not a nuclear weapon, and [it is]{.mark}
**intellectually [lazy]{.mark}** [to equate them to nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. Using a tactical nuclear weapon against
an urban center would produce several hundred thousand casualties, while
a strategic nuclear exchange would cause tens of millions of casualties
and immense physical destruction. These are catastrophes that some hack
cannot duplicate. [The shadow of **nuclear war distorts discussion** of
cyber warfare]{.underline}.

[State use of cyber operations is consistent with their broad national
strategies and interests. Their **primary emphasis** is on]{.underline}
**[espionage]{.underline}** [and political]{.underline} [**coercion**.
The **U**nited **S**tates has **[opponents]{.mark}** and is in
**conflict** with them, but they [have **no interest** in]{.mark}
launching **a [catastrophic]{.mark} cyber[attack]{.mark}** since [it
would]{.mark} **certainly** [produce]{.mark} **an [equal]{.mark}ly
catastrophic [retaliation]{.mark}**. Their goal is to stay below the
"use-of-force" threshold]{.underline} and undertake damaging cyber
actions against the United States, [not start a war]{.underline}.

[This has implications]{.underline} for the discussion of
[**[inadvertent escalation]{.mark}**, something that has
also]{.underline} **[[never occurred]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The concern
over escalation deserves a longer discussion, as [there are both
**technological** and **strategic** **[constraints]{.mark}** that shape
and **[limit risk]{.mark} in cyber operations**, and **the
[absence]{.mark} of inadvertent escalation** [suggests]{.mark} **a high
degree of [control]{.mark}** for cyber capabilities [by **advanced
states**]{.mark}. Attackers, particularly among the **U**nited
**S**tates' major **opponents**]{.underline} [for whom cyber is just one
of the tools for confrontation, seek to **avoid actions** that could
**trigger escalation**]{.underline}.

[The **U**nited **S**tates has two opponents (**China** and **Russia**)
who are capable of damaging cyberattacks.]{.underline} Russia has
demonstrated its attack skills on the Ukrainian power grid, [but
[neither **Russia**]{.mark} **nor [China]{.mark}** [would]{.mark} be
**well served** by a]{.underline} similar [[attack]{.mark} on the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates. **[Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline}
is improving and [may reach the point where it [could]{.mark} use
cyberattacks]{.underline} to cause major damage, [[but]{.mark} it would
**[only]{.mark}** do so [when]{.mark} it has **decided** to **engage**
[in]{.mark} a]{.underline} [**major [armed conflict]{.mark}** with the
**U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}. Iran might attack targets outside
the United States and its allies with less risk and continues to
experiment with cyberattacks against Israeli critical infrastructure.
[[**North Korea** has **no**]{.mark}**t**]{.underline} yet [developed
this kind of [capability]{.mark}]{.underline}.

THE **[[MYTH OF CYBER-ESCALATION]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Much of the [[**current** understanding]{.mark} in Washington
[about]{.mark} the [role of cyber]{.mark}-operations [**in conflict** is
built on]{.mark} long-standing but [**false** assumptions]{.mark} about
cyberspace]{.underline}. Many [scholars have asserted that
cyber-operations could easily lead to military escalation, up to and
including the use of **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. Jason Healey and
Robert Jervis, for example, expressing a widely held view, have argued
that an incident that takes place in cyberspace, "might cross the
threshold into armed conflict either through a sense of impunity or
through miscalculation or mistake." Policymakers have also long believed
that cyberspace poses grave perils. In 2012, Secretary of Defense Leon
Panetta warned of an impending "cyber-Pearl Harbor," in which
adversaries could take down critical U.S. infrastructure through
cyberattacks. Nearly a decade later, FBI Director Christopher Wray
compared the threat from ransomware---when actors hold a target hostage
by encrypting data and demanding a ransom payment in return for
decrypting it---to the 9/11 attacks. And as recently as December 2021,
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin noted that in cyberspace, "norms of
behavior aren't well-established and the risks of escalation and
miscalculation are high."

Seemingly buttressing these claims has been a long record of
cyber-operations by hostile governments. In recent years, [states
ranging from Russia and China to Iran and North Korea have used
cyberspace to conduct **large-scale espionage**]{.underline}, inflict
significant economic damage, and undermine democratic institutions. In
January 2021, for example, attackers linked to the Chinese government
were able to breach Microsoft's Exchange email servers, giving them
access to communications and other private information from companies
and governments, and may have allowed other malicious actors to conduct
ransomware attacks. That breach followed on the heels of a Russian
intrusion against the software vendor SolarWinds, in which hackers were
able to access a huge quantity of sensitive government and corporate
data---an espionage treasure trove. Cyberattacks have also inflicted
significant economic costs. The NotPetya attack affected critical
infrastructure around the world---ranging from logistics and energy to
finance and government---causing upward of \$10 billion in damage.

But [the [assumption that cyber]{.mark}-operations [play a central role
in]{.mark} either [provoking]{.mark} or extending [war is
**wrong**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Hundreds]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of
cyber-incidents have [occurred between rivals with]{.mark} **long
histories** [of tension]{.mark}]{.underline} or even conflict, but none
has ever triggered an escalation to war. [North Korea, for example, has
conducted major cyberattacks against South Korea on at least **four
different occasions**]{.underline}, including the "Ten Days of Rain"
denial of service attack---in which a network is flooded with an
overwhelming number of requests, becoming temporarily inaccessible to
users---against South Korean government websites, financial
institutions, and critical infrastructure in 2011 and the "Dark Seoul"
attack in 2013, which disrupted service across the country's financial
and media sectors.

[[No cyber operation]{.mark} has [**ever** triggered a
war]{.mark}]{.underline}.

It would be reasonable to expect that these [operations might
escalate]{.underline} the situation on the Korean Peninsula, especially
because North Korea's war plans against South Korea reportedly involve
cyber-operations. Yet that [is **not what happened**]{.underline}.
Instead, in each case, the [South Korean [response was **minimal and
limited**]{.mark} to either direct, official attribution to North Korea
by government officials or more indirect public suggestions]{.underline}
that Pyongyang was likely behind the attacks.

Similarly, [although the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates reserves the
right to respond to cyberattacks]{.underline} in any way it sees fit,
including with military force, [it has until now [relied on **economic
sanctions**, **indictments**]{.mark}, diplomatic actions, and some
reported instances of **tit-for-tat cyber-responses**]{.underline}. For
example, [following Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential
election, the Obama administration **expelled** 35 Russian diplomats and
**shuttered** two facilities said to be hubs for Russian
espionage]{.underline}. The Treasury [Department also levied economic
sanctions against Russian officials]{.underline}. Yet according to media
reports, the [administration ultimately **rejected plans** to conduct
retaliatory cyber-operations]{.underline} against Russia. And although
the United States did use its own cyber-operations to respond to Russian
attacks during the 2018 midterm elections, it limited itself to
temporarily disrupting the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll
farm.

These [measured responses are **not** unusual]{.underline}. Despite
decades of malicious behavior in cyberspace---and [[**no matter the
level** of destruction]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[cyberattacks]{.mark}
have always been [contained below]{.mark} the [level of armed
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, researchers have found that major
[adversarial [powers]{.mark} across the world have routinely [**observed
a "firebreak**" between cyberattacks and]{.mark} conventional military
operations]{.underline}: a mutually understood line that distinguishes
strategic interactions above and below it, [similar to the threshold
that exists for the **employment of [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

But [it is not just that cyber-operations do not lead to
conflict]{.underline}. [Cyberattacks can also be useful ways to project
power in situations in which armed conflict is expressly being
avoided]{.underline}. [This is why Iran, for example, might find
cyberattacks against the United States]{.underline}, including the
2012--13 denial of service attacks it conducted against U.S. financial
institutions, **[appealing]{.underline}**. Since Iran likely prefers to
avoid a direct military confrontation with the United States,
[cyberattacks provide a way to retaliate for perceived grievances, such
as U.S. economic sanctions in response to Iran's nuclear program,
**without triggering** the kind of escalation that would put the two
countries on a path to war]{.underline}.

#### Dollar heg is inevitable. 

**Stokes 18** Doug Stokes, International Relations Professor at the
University of Exeter. \[Trump, American hegemony and the future of the
liberal international order, International Affairs, 94(1)\]//BPS

Structuring advantages within the liberal order As the protector of an
open, integrated international market, the American state can claim
special privileges to enable it to preserve the zone effectively, and
there are a number of areas where being the system maker gives the US
huge positional advantages. The first such area we should note here is
its ['[dollar heg]{.mark}emony']{.underline}, whereby the greenback acts
as the world's default global currency: this, most notably, allows it to
run progressively larger current account deficits without having to
worry about foreign exchange reserves. This [[makes
the]{.underline}]{.mark} US [[Fed]{.mark}eral Reserve]{.underline} [[the
world's]{.underline}]{.mark} de facto [**central [bank]{.mark}**, giving
it the luxury of **[unilaterally setting borrowing
costs]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} the rest of
[[the]{.mark} [global econ]{.mark}omy. It is [this]{.mark}]{.underline}
form of dollar hegemony, and the ['exorbitant privilege']{.underline} it
[[affords]{.mark} the [America]{.mark}n state,]{.underline}28 that has
helped inform a range of scholarship on American economic decline,
especially [[in relation to]{.mark} a rising [China]{.mark}]{.underline}
and the potential internationalization of the renminbi and the
associated challenge to US monetary regimes. According to this
'declinist' narrative, if the dollar loses its international reserve
currency status other aspects of US hegemony, most notably its global
military primacy, will begin to crumble as other currencies vie for
international monetary leadership.29 In short, the 'dollar's reserve
currency role is central to America's geopolitical preeminence and if it
loses that status US hegemony will be literally unaffordable'.30
However, not only does this ['renminbi revisionism' ignore]{.underline}
the [ways in which US [military primacy]{.mark} in]{.underline} east
[Asia [helps bolster]{.mark} its **[monetary
power]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see below); [it is not borne out by the
hard data.]{.underline} According to the most recently available data
from the Bank of International Settlements in its 2016 triennial survey,
[the [dollar accounted for **88 per cent** of all]{.mark}
over-the-counter [trades in]{.mark} **foreign exchange
[markets]{.mark}** [in 2016.]{.mark} The renminbi accounted for just 4
per cent.]{.underline}31 [[This]{.mark} is a **[huge
disparity]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[[hardly
supports]{.underline}]{.mark}** the idea of [[an imminent end]{.mark} to
dollar hegemony.]{.underline} Dollar hegemony also has profound
geopolitical implications. Specifically, the United States can fund its
overseas military operations with freshly printed dollars largely at
will. Between 2003 and 2008, for example, the 'largest airborne transfer
of currency in the history of the world' saw the Federal Reserve print
and ship US\$40 billion in cash to Iraq to help finance the war. In just
'the first two years, the shipments included more than 281 million
individual bills weighing a total of 363 tons'.32 Dollar dominance has
thus ensured that imports, debts and overseas military--political
operations could all be paid for with greenbacks produced by the
American state, which at the same time could gear its domestic
macroeconomic management exclusively to conditions within the United
States without any significant external constraint. More interestingly,
[dollar [liquidity means]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[investors]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to [[use US]{.mark} monetary
regimes]{.underline} **[[even in]{.underline}]{.mark}** the context of
[major global economic [instability.]{.mark}]{.underline} For example,
[[during]{.underline}]{.mark} the global financial crisis of
[[2008]{.mark},]{.underline} not only did we not see a flight from US
financial and monetary regimes, [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} actually
[[saw]{.underline}]{.mark} the reverse: [a **global [flight]{.mark} of
capital** [into US]{.mark} debt [markets]{.mark}]{.underline}, to the
extent that in some instances [[US]{.mark} Treasury [bonds had
**negative interest**]{.mark} **rates**.]{.underline}33 In short, dollar
hegemony and its privileges allow the US to externalize major crises
through its unilateral capacity to alter its interest rates, to force
other states to adjust accordingly, and to fund geopolitical hegemony on
the cheap.

#### Economic decline doesn't cause war.

**Walt 20** -- Stephen Walt, International Relations Professor at
Harvard University. \[Will a Global Depression Trigger Another World
War? 5-13-20,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/\]

On balance, however, [[I do not think]{.underline}]{.mark} that even the
extraordinary [[econ]{.mark}omic conditions]{.underline} we are
witnessing today [are going to]{.underline} have much
[[impact]{.underline}]{.mark} on **[the likelihood of
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Why? [First]{.underline} of all, [[if
depressions]{.underline}]{.mark} were a powerful
[[cause]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[war, there]{.mark} [would be]{.mark}
**a lot [more]{.mark} of the latter**]{.underline}. To take one example,
[the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates has
[[suffered **40**]{.mark} **or more recessions**]{.underline} since the
country was founded, [[yet]{.underline}]{.mark} it has [fought **perhaps
[20]{.mark} interstate [wars]{.mark}**[, most]{.mark} of them
[**unrelated** to]{.mark}]{.underline} the state of [the
[econ]{.mark}omy]{.underline}. To paraphrase the economist Paul
Samuelson's famous quip about the stock market, if recessions were a
powerful cause of war, they would have predicted "nine out of the last
five (or fewer)."

[Second, states do not start wars unless they believe they will win a
quick and relatively cheap victory]{.underline}. As John Mearsheimer
showed in his classic book Conventional Deterrence, [[national leaders
**avoid** war when]{.underline}]{.mark} they are [convinced it will be
**[long]{.mark}**, **bloody**, **costly**, [and
**uncertain**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To choose war, political leaders
have to convince themselves they can either win a quick, cheap, and
decisive victory or achieve some limited objective at low cost. Europe
went to war in 1914 with each side believing it would win a rapid and
easy victory, and Nazi Germany developed the strategy of blitzkrieg in
order to subdue its foes as quickly and cheaply as possible. Iraq
attacked Iran in 1980 because Saddam believed the Islamic Republic was
in disarray and would be easy to defeat, and George W. Bush invaded Iraq
in 2003 convinced the war would be short, successful, and pay for
itself.

[The fact]{.underline} that each of these [leaders
miscalculated]{.underline} badly [does not alter the main point: [No
matter]{.mark}]{.underline} what a [country's [econ]{.mark}omic
condition]{.underline} might be, [its [leaders will **not**]{.mark} go
to [war unless]{.mark} they]{.underline} think they [can]{.underline} do
so [**[quick]{.mark}ly**, **[cheap]{.mark}ly**, [and with]{.mark} **a
reasonable probability of [success]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Third]{.underline}, and most important, [the]{.underline} primary
[[motivation for]{.underline}]{.mark} most wars
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} the desire for **[[security, not]{.mark}
economic [gain]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For this reason, the odds of war
increase when states believe the long-term balance of power may be
shifting against them, when they are convinced that adversaries are
unalterably hostile and cannot be accommodated, and when they are
confident they can reverse the unfavorable trends and establish a secure
position if they act now. The historian A.J.P. Taylor once observed that
[["every war]{.mark} between Great Powers]{.underline} \[between 1848
and 1918\] ... [[started as]{.mark} **a [preventive]{.mark} war**,
[not]{.mark} as **a war of [conquest]{.mark}**[,"]{.mark} and that
remains true of most wars]{.underline} fought [since then]{.underline}.

The bottom line: [[Econ]{.mark}omic conditions]{.underline} (i.e., a
depression) may affect the broader political environment in which
decisions for war or peace are made, but they [[are]{.mark} **only
[one]{.mark}** [factor among **many**]{.mark} and **[rarely]{.mark} the
most [significant]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even if the COVID-19 pandemic
has large, lasting, and negative effects on [the]{.underline} world
[[economy]{.underline}]{.mark}---as seems quite likely---it [[is
**not**]{.mark} **likely** [to affect]{.mark} **the probability of
[war]{.mark} very much**]{.underline}, especially in the short term.

Yet [**the [history]{.mark}** of **technological revolutions** [counsels
against alarmism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Extrapolating from current
technological trends is problematic, both because
[[tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline} often [[do not live up to]{.mark}

the nature of [war]{.underline}fare and deterrence after the British

[Yet]{.underline} chemical weapons quickly [turned out to be **less

than conventional high-explosives in inflicting damage and disrupting
enemy operations.6 Other technologies have become important only after
advancements in other areas allowed them to reach their full potential:
until armies developed tactics for effectively employing firearms, for

#### No impact to meltdowns.

But Fukushima, Chernobyl, And Three Mile Island Show Why Nuclear Is
Inherently Safe, 3-11-19,

But now, eight years after Fukushima, [the best-available
science]{.underline} clearly [shows]{.underline} that [Caldicott's
estimate]{.underline} of the number of people killed by nuclear
accidents [was off by one million. Radiation]{.underline} from Chernobyl
[will kill, at most, 200 people]{.underline}, while the [radiation from
Fukushima and Three Mile Island will kill zero people]{.underline}. In
other words, [the main [lesson]{.mark}]{.underline} that should be drawn
[[from **the worst**]{.mark} **nuclear [accidents]{.mark}** [is]{.mark}
that [nuclear]{.mark} energy [has **always been**]{.mark} **inherently
[safe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The truth about nuclear power's safety is
so shocking that it's worth taking a closer look at the worst accidents,
starting with the worst of the worst: Chernobyl. The nuclear plant is in
Ukraine which, in 1986, the year of the accident, was a Soviet Republic.
Operators lost control of an unauthorized experiment that resulted in
the reactor catching fire. There was no containment dome, and the fire
spewed out radioactive particulate matter, which went all over the
world, leading many to conclude that Chernobyl is not just the worst
nuclear accident in history but is also the worst nuclear accident
possible. Twenty-eight firefighters died after putting out the Chernobyl
fire. While the death of any firefighter is tragic, it's worth putting
that number in perspective. Eighty-six firefighters died in the U.S. in
2018, and 343 firefighters died during the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks. Since the Chernobyl accident, 19 first responders have died,
according to the United Nations, for "various reasons" including
tuberculosis, cirrhosis of the liver, heart attacks, and trauma. The
U.N. concluded that "the assignment of radiation as the cause of death
has become less clear." What about cancer? By 2065 there may be 16,000
thyroid cancers; to date there have been 6,000. Since thyroid cancer has
a mortality rate of just one percent --- it is an easy cancer to treat
--- expected deaths may be 160. The World Health Organization claims on
its web site [that Chernobyl could result in the premature [deaths of
4,000]{.mark} people]{.underline}, but according to Dr. Geraldine
Thomas, who started and runs the Chernobyl Tissue Bank, that number
[[is]{.mark} based on **a [disproven]{.mark} methodology**]{.underline}.
"[That]{.underline} WHO [number is based on [LNT]{.mark},"]{.underline}
she explained, using the acronym for the "linear no-threshold" method of
extrapolating deaths from radiation. LNT assumes that there is no
threshold below which radiation is safe, but [that]{.underline}
assumption [[has been discredited]{.mark} over recent decades **[by
multiple]{.mark} sources of [data]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Support for
the idea that radiation is harmless at low levels comes from the fact
that people who live in places with higher background radiation, like
Colorado, do not suffer elevated rates of cancer. In fact, [residents of
Colorado, where radiation is higher because of]{.underline} high
concentrations of [uranium in the ground, enjoy]{.underline} some of
[the lowest cancer rates in the U.]{.underline}S. Even relatively high
doses of radiation cause far less harm than most people think. Careful,
large, and long-term studies of survivors of the atomic bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki offer compelling demonstration. [[Cancer rates
were]{.mark} **just [10 percent higher among]{.mark} atomic [blast
survivors]{.mark}**[, most]{.mark} of whom [never got
cancer]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even those who received a dose 1,000 times
higher than today's safety limit saw their lives cut short by an average
of 16 months. But didn't the Japanese government recently award a
financial settlement to the family of a Fukushima worker who claimed his
cancer was from the accident? It did, but for reasons that were clearly
political, and having to do with the Japanese government's
consensus-based, conflict-averse style, as well as lingering guilt felt
by elite policymakers toward Fukushima workers and residents, who felt
doubly aggrieved by the tsunami and meltdowns. The worker's cancer was
highly unlikely to have come from Fukushima because, once again, the
level of radiation workers received was far lower than the ones received
by the Hiroshima/Nagasaki cohort that saw (modestly) higher cancer
rates. What about [Three Mile Island?]{.underline} After the accident in
1979, Time Magazine ran a cover story that superimposed a glowing
headline, "Nuclear Nightmare," over an image of the plant.
[[**Nightmare? More like a dream.** What other]{.mark} **major
industrial [technology]{.mark}** [can suffer]{.mark} **a [catastrophic
failure]{.mark}** [and **not kill anyone**?]{.mark}]{.underline}
Remember when the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig caught on fire and
killed 11 people? Four months later, a Pacific Gas & Electric natural
gas pipeline exploded just south of San Francisco and killed eight
people sleeping in their beds. And that was just one year, 2010. The
worst energy accident of all time was the 1975 collapse of the Banqiao
hydroelectric dam in China. It collapsed and killed between 170,000 and
230,000 people. [Nuclear's]{.underline} worst [accidents
show]{.underline} that [the technology has always been safe]{.underline}
for the same, inherent reason that it has always had such a small
environmental impact: the high energy density of its fuel. [[Splitting
atoms]{.mark} to create heat]{.underline}, rather than than splitting
chemical bonds through fire, [[requires **tiny**]{.mark} **amounts of
[fuel]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A single Coke can of uranium can provide
enough energy for an entire high-energy life. [[When the worst
occurs]{.mark}, and the fuel melts, [the amount]{.mark} of]{.underline}
particulate [matter [that escapes]{.mark}]{.underline} from the plant
[[is **insignificant**]{.underline}]{.mark} in contrast to both the
fiery explosions of fossil fuels and the daily emission of particulate
matter from fossil- and biomass-burning homes, cars, and power plants,
which kill seven million people a year. It\'s not that nuclear energy
never kills. It\'s that [nuclear\'s [death toll is **vanishingly
small**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider nuclear\'s global death toll in
context. These are just annual deaths. - walking: 270,000 - driving:
1,350,000 - working: 2,300,000 - air pollution: 4,200,000 By contrast,
[nuclear\'s death total is]{.underline} likely to be **[[around
200]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### AT: Hypersonics\-\--1AR 

#### Hypersonics [fail]{.underline} AND are inevitable. 

**Wright 21** -- David Wright, PhD, research associate in the Laboratory
for Nuclear Security and Policy in the Department of Nuclear Science and
Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Cameron Tracy,
PhD, a Kendall Science Fellow in the Global Security Program at the
Union of Concerned Scientists. \[Why hypersonic weapons cannot live up
to their hype, 2-3-2021,
https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/536754-why-hypersonic-weapons-cannot-live-up-to-their-hype\]

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [Russia and China are
developing **hypersonic weapons**]{.underline} --- missiles that carry
warheads through the atmosphere at more than five times the speed of
sound. The fevered interest in these weapons is driving competition
among these countries that costs billions of dollars per year, heightens
tensions, and may undermine broader arms control efforts. 

Ironically, [**the strong [desire]{.mark}** for these weapons
[results]{.mark}]{.underline} in part [[from]{.mark} **widespread,
[exaggerated claims]{.mark}**]{.underline} about unique capabilities
they reportedly offer in terms of short delivery times, maneuverability
and stealth. Pentagon officials continue to spread [these
claims](https://armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/19-14_02-26-19.pdf),
despite the fact that [**technical [analysis]{.mark}** [shows they
are]{.mark} **simply [false]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Such claims have been repeated broadly, leading to assertions by
officials that "[developments in hypersonic propulsion will
revolutionize
warfare](https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Ashley_03-06-18.pdf)."
In March 2018, Russian President [Vladimir
Putin](https://thehill.com/people/vladimir-putin) described Russia's
acquisition of this technology as "[the most important stage in the
development of modern weapons
systems](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/56957)." Russia
declared with much fanfare in December 2019 that it had fielded the
long-range, nuclear-armed Avangard, making it the first nation to
acquire hypersonic capability and upping the ante for the United States.

To better understand these claims, [we conducted detailed computer
modeling](http://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/sgs28tracy.pdf) of
long-range hypersonic weapons using publicly available information about
a U.S. hypersonic test vehicle,
the [HTV-2](https://www.darpa.mil/program/falcon-htv-2). Our analysis
shows that [**fundamental physical limitations** imposed by **high-speed
flight**]{.underline} through the atmosphere [render hypersonic
missiles]{.underline}, at best, an **[evolutionary --- not
revolutionary]{.underline}** --- advancement over existing ballistic
missile technologies. 

Specifically, [our calculations
show](http://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/sgs28tracy.pdf) that
hypersonic weapons travel intercontinental distances more slowly than
comparable ballistic missiles flying on low-altitude trajectories,
called depressed trajectories. Moreover, we find that these weapons
become so hot from atmospheric drag at these high speeds that they emit
an intense glow that can be seen for most of their flight by space-based
sensors. As a result, claims that they are "[nearly
invisible](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/magazine/hypersonic-missiles.html)"
to early-warning systems are not true --- instead, they are easily seen
and tracked by existing early-warning satellites.

In addition, while hypersonic gliders can maneuver, the extent of that
maneuvering is more limited than is frequently suggested, since
[[**maneuvering** comes at]{.mark} **a significant [cost]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} **the [range]{.mark}** the missile can reach]{.underline}.

Since these [limitations [result from]{.mark} **the [fundamental
physics]{.mark}** of an object at **high speed**]{.underline}
interacting with the atmosphere, they are not specific to the HTV-2
vehicle but are general features of a broad range of hypersonic weapons
--- both U.S. weapons and those developed abroad. 

The Pentagon [has
questioned](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/science/hypersonic-missile-weapons.html) whether
our analysis is relevant to current hypersonic weapons being developed
since we rely on available data from a test system that is several years
old. The most important **[[design]{.mark} elements]{.underline}** we
assume in our analysis, however, likely [[have not
**changed**]{.underline}]{.mark} much since that time, and the
**[prospects]{.underline}** of their changing to significantly improve
hypersonic performance [in the future seem **dim**]{.underline}.

In particular, the value of the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) of a hypersonic
weapon is central to its performance. To stay aloft, these gliders must
generate aerodynamic lift. But generating lift also creates aerodynamic
drag that slows the glider, and L/D tells how much drag necessarily
accompanies the required amount of lift. Generating high drag reduces
the speed of the glider, which limits its range and maneuverability, and
results in heating of the glider and the surrounding air, which produces
the infrared light signal trackable by satellites. 

While L/D of commercial aircraft may be 15 or larger, achievable values
at hypersonic velocities are much lower. Following decades of research
and development of hypersonic technologies, the HTV-2 [is
estimated](http://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/sgs23acton.pdf) to
have an L/D of 2.6. There is no indication that significantly higher
values have become possible without sacrifices in payload volume or
thermal resilience in the last decade, or will any time soon. Without
this, [**the fundamental physical [issue]{.mark}** --- [that]{.mark}
**high [drag]{.mark}** [reduces]{.mark} **the [speed and range]{.mark}**
of hypersonic gliders [and makes them **visible**]{.mark} **from space**
--- will not **change**]{.underline}. 

Why does it matter if these weapons ultimately cannot live up to the
hype around them? On the one hand, these efforts are [costing billions
of
dollars](https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2021/fy2021_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf) that
could be used more profitably elsewhere. 

But the most consequential effects of these weapons on global security
may arise from perceptions of their performance, rather than actual
capabilities. Fears that a country might fall behind its adversaries in
the hypersonic arena are exacerbating tensions between the United
States, Russia and China and spawning a hypersonic arms race. This
dynamic could add new weapons to global arsenals and prevent progress on
serious nuclear arms control. Moreover, **[unsubstantiated
[beliefs]{.mark}]{.underline}** about the military utility of hypersonic
weapons [are **[stifl]{.mark}ing [arms control]{.mark}**]{.underline}
efforts to limit these systems before they proliferate. 

#### Ignore 2NR buzzwords. 

**Raitasalo 19** -- Lt. Col. Jyri Raitasalo, military professor of war
studies at the Finnish National Defence University. \[Hypersonic Weapons
are No Game-Changer, 1-5-2019,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/hypersonic-weapons-are-no-game-changer-40632\]

**[The ongoing Western ["hypersonic hype" is]{.mark}]{.underline}** a
very familiar phenomenon. The profession of security and defense
analysis is [[flooded with **buzzwords**]{.mark}, **high-tech silver
bullets** and **slogans**]{.underline}. Can you remember the Revolution
in Military Affairs (RMA)? It was supposed to remove friction and the
fog of war from the battlefield. This never materialized, although the
United States and many European countries did try to ride the
revolutionary wave during the late 1990s and the following
decade---pouring in hundreds of billions of dollars to maintain military
"edge" against all potential adversaries. Similarly, Cyberwar has
supposedly been coming ever since 1993---although we have not seen one
instance of cyberwar, yet. Nor do we have any solid indication that
future cyberwars---if they actually will be waged---will radically alter
the character of war, or how wars are waged. All defense-related
buzzwords hinder---rather than help us---to understand the complex
security environment and the associated military threats that already
exist or those that will exist in the future. In sum, hypersonic weapons
will be fielded in the near future, but there is no evidence that would
suggest that the basic logic related to defence and strategy was going
to change radically because of these new weapon systems. More likely,
new technologies and weapon systems continue to develop and spread
around the globe---and with them a new buzzword will replace hypersonic
weapons---or Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is another hype of the
day---within a few years.

There are many reasons why hypersonic weapons will not revolutionize
strategy or warfare in the future. Not at least for the United States,
which is the hub of hypersonic frenzy these days. Firstly, the military
power of the United States will remain second to none for years---and
more likely for decades to come. [[Hypersonic threats do not require
hypersonic responses.]{.mark} The [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has]{.mark} **a broad repertoire of
[effective]{.mark} military [responses]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
potential hypersonic threats [[even if]{.mark} it
[lagged]{.mark}]{.underline} a few months or [**[years behind]{.mark}
Russia and China** in hypersonic missiles]{.underline}. In addition,
[[to think]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[any]{.mark} potential
[weapon]{.mark} system that has no known defenses [is an existential
threat]{.mark}]{.underline} to the United States [[is]{.mark} **based on
[unrealistic]{.mark} thinking**]{.underline}. Even if for a very brief
period after the end of the Cold War this kind of thinking made some
sense, it would be hubristic to assume that the United States could be a
world leader in all fields of technologies at all times.

In short, if one's strategy is based on striving for total
invulnerability vis-à-vis one's adversaries, it will inevitably end up
being a failure. As John Lewis Gaddis has so eloquently noted, strategy
requires balancing almost infinite aspirations (goals) with the limited
means available to the actor. Striving for primacy in all possible
weapons technologies is a way for disaster. The sooner the military
planners and political decision-makers realize this, the better.
Understanding the limits of strategy will make them think more, instead
of trying to achieve the unachievable: total invulnerability vis-à-vis a
very broad hodgepodge of adversaries---varying from "rogue regimes"
near-peer adversaries.

The second aspect that will mitigate the threat posed by hypersonic
weapons is related to the fact that [in many future
scenarios]{.underline}, the projections of [adversaries' possibilities
to]{.underline} develop and [field hypersonic weapons ignore or downplay
one's own efforts to do the same]{.underline}. The development of
[[military]{.mark} capability [is]{.mark} **a [long-term]{.mark}
effort**. Today's [wars are fought with weapon]{.mark}
system[s]{.mark}]{.underline} that have been
[[developed]{.underline}]{.mark} and procured [[during the last fifty
years]{.underline}]{.mark}. Some have an even longer pedigree---like the
B-52 Stratofortress. Russia and China cannot escape this long-term
character of defense planning and military capability development. Even
if Russia or China have made some strides in developing hypersonic
missiles lately, this will not turn automatically into usable military
capabilities en masse. A state---any state---can regenerate
approximately 2-3 percent of its total military capability during the
period of one year. The long shadow of history or the long "tail" of
military capability development is a fact of life in the field of
defense. [[There]{.mark} **just [are no U-turns]{.mark}** or **quick
transformations** [within]{.mark} **the sphere of
[defense]{.mark}**]{.underline}---even if some advocates of these
revolutions think and speak otherwise.

Finally, the strategy of [[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}---based on
real warfighting capabilities---[[should not be
underestimated]{.underline}]{.mark} when trying to prevent adversaries
from using their "hypersonic edge" against the United States. [[It
is]{.mark} **really [a stretch]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} try to
[[imagine **any**]{.mark} **regime in the world**]{.underline} that
[[would be **so suicidal**]{.underline}]{.mark} that it would even think
threatening to use---not to mention to actually use---hypersonic weapons
against the United States or its troops deployed almost globally would
end well. Hypersonic weapon systems are coming. That is a fact. But
these [new [weapons will not change]{.mark} **the fundamentals of
[strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the long-term logic of defense
planning or military capability development. Hypersonic missiles will
not become a panacea or a silver bullet, which could give Russia or
China an edge against the United States on the battlefield. Nor will
hypersonic weapons derail the United States from the top position of the
global military power pecking order.

#### No Russia war.

In an atmosphere of crisis permeated by mutual recriminations and
suspicions, both sides---NATO and Russia---have engaged in a series of
military activities along the line of contact. These maneuvers in turn
have triggered multiple warnings from both sides of a sharp
deterioration in European security, a growing threat of a military
confrontation between Russia and NATO, and an urgent need to deescalate
the situation in order to avoid a catastrophic war with disastrous
consequences for all. An [emerging conventional wisdom
maintains]{.underline} that [the new Cold War in Europe]{.underline}, if
allowed to continue unchecked, [runs the risk of escalating into a hot
war]{.underline} unless steps to reduce tensions are taken swiftly.

But [**conventional wisdom** is]{.underline} often
**[wrong]{.underline}**, and so it is this time. The
[[hysteria]{.underline}]{.mark} that has engulfed public commentary
throughout Europe about this ostensibly dire military situation on the
brink of getting out of hand [[has **little**]{.mark}**, if any**,
[basis]{.mark} in fact. Both [sides]{.mark} in the standoff
**[exaggerate]{.mark}** the [tensions and]{.mark} **the [danger]{.mark}
of escalation**]{.underline}, and the risks of the military
moves---their own and their adversary's---supposedly driving these
tensions.

In reality, [**the military [balance]{.mark}** between Russia and NATO
[is **stable**]{.mark}, the **danger of [escalation]{.mark}** [is
hardly]{.mark} approaching **[critical]{.mark} levels**]{.underline},
and [little needs to be **done militarily** to defuse **the current
tensions**. The true [cause of]{.mark} the [tensions is **not
military**, but **political**]{.mark} **and diplomatic**. Until those
causes are **resolved**, [tensions]{.mark} between Russia and the West
will [remain **high**]{.mark}. The [likelihood of]{.mark} a **military
[confrontation]{.mark}** will remain **[low]{.mark}**]{.underline},
however, [[because **neither**]{.mark} **side's [posture]{.mark}**
[points to]{.mark}]{.underline} a heightened state of readiness or
[**[intent]{.mark}ion** [to go on]{.mark} the
[offensive]{.mark}]{.underline}. Until that changes, [**political and

As a study from the RAND Corporation noted,
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has [["invested **considerable sums** in

options that can achieve strategic effects without resorting to nuclear
weapons."145 Others note, however, that Russia has integrated these
"conventional precision weapons and nuclear weapons into a single
strategic weapon set," lending credence to the view that Russia may be
prepared to employ, or threaten to employ, nuclear weapons during a
regional conflict.

Yet [**the [history]{.mark}** of **technological revolutions** [counsels
against alarmism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Extrapolating from current
technological trends is problematic, both because
[[tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline} often [[do not live up to]{.mark}

First, [very [few]{.mark} technologies **fundamentally
[reshape]{.mark}** the dynamics of international
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. Historically, **[most technological

changes** in the international system, they]{.underline} are likely to
[[have]{.mark} **variegated** and **even contradictory effects**.
Technologies may be **destabilising** [under **some
conditions**]{.mark}, but **[stabilis]{.mark}ing in
others**]{.underline}. Furthermore, **[other
[factors]{.mark}]{.underline}** are likely to [[mediate]{.mark} **the
[effects]{.mark} of new technologies** on the international system,
including **[geography]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the distribution of
[**[material power]{.mark}**, **military strategy**, **[domestic]{.mark}
and organisational [politics]{.mark}**, and **social and cultural
variables**]{.underline}, to name only a few.8 Consequently, the
strategic effects of new technologies often defy simple classification.
Indeed, more than 70 years after nuclear weapons emerged as a new
technology, their consequences for stability continue to be debated.9

Finally, [the latter set of [supposed]{.mark}ly existential]{.underline}
normative or ideological [[threats consists of]{.mark} many elements,
including [Beijing's]{.mark} possible **[overturning]{.mark}** of
[the]{.mark} so-called global [**l**iberal]{.mark} **i**nternational
[**o**rder]{.mark}, Chinese **influence operations** aimed at U.S.
society, the **export** of China's **political values**]{.underline} and
state-directed economic approach, [and its sale of **surveillance
technologies**]{.underline} and other items [that
facilitate]{.underline} the rise or strengthening of [**authoritarian
states**. These threats]{.underline} all seem hair-raising at first
glance. But while significant, they [are greatly
exaggerated]{.underline} and do not rise to the level of constituting an
existential threat.

[[Beijing has **little interest** in **exporting**]{.mark} its
**[governance]{.mark} system**, and where it does, it is almost entirely
directed at **developing countries**, not industrial
democracies]{.underline} such as the United States. In addition, [there
is **no evidence** to indicate that the Chinese are **actually engaged**
in **compelling** or actively **persuading** countries to follow their
experience]{.underline}. Rather, [[they want]{.mark} developing [nations
to]{.mark} study from and [copy]{.mark}]{.underline} China's approach
because doing so would help [[to legitimize the]{.mark} Chinese
[system]{.mark}]{.underline} both internationally and more importantly
[[to]{.mark} Beijing's **[domestic audience]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In addition, [the notion that Beijing is deliberately attempting to
control other countries]{.underline} and make them more authoritarian
[by entrapping them in **debt** [and]{.mark} selling them "Big Brother"
hardware such as **surveillance systems** is **unsupported** by the
**facts**. Chinese [banks show **little desire** to extend **loans that
will fail**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the failures that do occur are
mostly [due to **poor feasibility studies** and the **incompetence** and
excessive zeal of lenders and/or borrowers]{.underline}. Moreover, [in
both loan-giving and surveillance equipment sales, China has shown no
**specific preference** for nondemocratic over democratic
states]{.underline}.

[Even if Beijing were to **attempt** to export its development
approach]{.underline} to other states, [the [actual
**attractiveness**]{.mark} of that approach [would prove]{.mark} to be
**highly [limited]{.mark}**. The [**features undergirding**
China]{.mark}'s developmental success [are **not
replicable**]{.mark}]{.underline} for most (if any) countries. [These
include a **high savings rate**; a highly acquisitive and
**entrepreneurial cultural environment**; a **state-owned banking**
system and **nonconvertible currency**; many massive **state-owned
industries**]{.underline} that exist to provide employment, facilitate
party control over key sectors, and drive huge infrastructure
construction; [[and]{.mark} **strong controls** over virtually all
information flows]{.underline}. Moreover, [such a model]{.underline} (if
you can call it that) [is almost certainly **[not
sustainable]{.mark}**]{.underline} in its present form, [[given]{.mark}
China's **[aging population]{.mark}**, extensive
**[corruption]{.mark}**, very large levels of **[income
inequality]{.mark}**, inadequate social **safety net**, [and]{.mark} the
fact [that **free info**]{.mark}**rmation [flows]{.mark}** are required
to [drive]{.mark} **global [innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Although [China's]{.underline} combination of economic reform policies
and authoritarian [political system has been around [since the]{.mark}
early 19[80s, **not a single nation** has adopted that system]{.mark}
either **willingly** or under **Chinese compulsion**. There
are]{.underline} certainly many [authoritarian states and fragile
democracies]{.underline} on China's periphery, [but none of them were
made that way by China]{.underline}.

[China's challenge to the so-called global **l**iberal **i**nternational
**o**rder is also **exaggerated**]{.underline}. In the first place, [[it
is **highly debatable**]{.mark} whether in fact [a single]{.mark}
**coherent** [global order **even exists**]{.mark}. What observers
usually refer to]{.underline} as the "liberal international order" (a
relatively recent term) actually [consists of an **amalgam** of
**disparate regimes** with different origins, including]{.underline}
international [**human rights** pacts, multilateral **economic
arrangements**, and an **international court**]{.underline}.

The United States certainly plays an important or leading role in many
of these regimes. But it did not create and does not drive all global
regimes---and in fact does not support some of them, such as the
International Court of Justice, and has not ratified some critical pacts
such as the United National Convention on the Law of the Sea. And many
very important global regimes (e.g., regarding the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, trade and investment, climate change, and
pandemics) have no deep connection to liberal democratic values per se
and are supported by Beijing, albeit sometimes more in letter than in
spirit.

[[The challenge]{.mark} for the **U**nited **S**tates [is not]{.mark}
how to fend off the **[imagined]{.mark} existential [threats]{.mark}**
posed by China. Rather, it lies in developing a]{.underline} much
clearer and [factually based overall understanding of the **limited
challenges**]{.underline}, threats, and indeed opportunities [China
poses]{.underline} to the United States [and the policies needed to
address them. [Reject]{.mark}ing [the **specious notion**]{.mark} that
[China is threatening to **destroy** a]{.mark}n **entire [way of
life]{.mark}** will make this]{.underline} task [much
easier]{.underline}.

### AT: Venezuela\-\--1AR 

#### No Russian involvement.

the Kremlin, Venezuela Is Not the Next Syria (Published 2019),

On the face of it, the upheaval in Venezuela would seem to check all his
boxes. **[[Venezuela]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [[is **not
Syria**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[It is **[separated]{.mark}** from Russia [by **thousands of miles of
ocean**]{.mark}; there is **[no]{.mark} allied [regional power]{.mark}**
like Iran that [Moscow can **rely on** to do]{.mark} **the [dirty
work]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the ground; [[and with **the**]{.mark}
**Russian [economy]{.mark}** [suffering]{.mark} **long-term
[anemia]{.mark}**[, the Kremlin does not]{.mark} really [have]{.mark}
**the [means]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} **the domestic [support]{.mark}**
[for **another**]{.mark} **costly overseas
[adventure]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Nevertheless, the question "What should Russia do?" is raised daily by
newspaper columnists and television pundits.

So far, the answer from [[the Kremlin]{.underline}]{.mark} seems to be
that it [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} mostly [[**fulminate** from the
sidelines]{.underline}]{.mark} and, as in every other foreign or
domestic crisis, splatter blame on the United States.

#### No impact.

the Kremlin, Venezuela Is Not the Next Syria (Published 2019),

But [[no one expects]{.mark} **a [replay of Syria]{.mark}**[.
Besides]{.mark} **the [geographical distance]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**the [expense]{.mark}**, there are **several key reasons**]{.underline}
that [[Russia is **unlikely** to intervene]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[In Syria, Russia could **fight** from **a
distance**]{.underline}]{.mark}, deploying its air force or firing
cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea. Iran supplied the ground troops
needed to defeat the anti-government militias.

Venezuela has not reached the point of war, and strategic bombers will
not help deal with demonstrators, Russian commentators have noted,
stressing that [[the Kremlin will not **deploy soldiers**]{.mark} to
fight **street battles**]{.underline} against opposition protesters in
Caracas or other cities.

In the Middle East, Russia has other friends besides Syria. In Latin
America, apart from Cuba, Nicaragua, Suriname and Bolivia, not a single
government backs Mr. Maduro. Thus [**[any]{.mark} Russian
[intervention]{.mark} [risks]{.mark}** [alienating **every
government**]{.mark} **on the continent**, [not to mention
provoking]{.mark} **more American [sanctions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Even among]{.mark} **Russian [hard-liners]{.mark}**[, there is]{.mark}
**a grudging [admiration]{.mark}** for the fact [that the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is]{.mark}
likely [to **whack anyone** who **intervenes**]{.mark} **too openly**
[in its back yard]{.mark}]{.underline}, with the Monroe Doctrine cited
frequently.
