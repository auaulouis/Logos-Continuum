the ships to hunt submarines or destroy mines]{.underline}** --- the
**[missions they were built to perform in the first

With 35 ships funded, **[Congress has every year since at least 2015 cut

As the program is currently structured, **[each ship is either a mine
sweeper, submarine hunter or small anti-surface
combatant]{.underline}**, all made possible by mission modules still
under development.

Appropriators are **[set to slice 77 percent from the Navy's mine

section of the budget. But the **[bulk of that slicing involves cuts to
Knifefish minesweeping drones and unmanned surface vehicles that are
intended to deploy sensors]{.underline}**, according to a readout
supplied by appropriators.

The **[surface warfare mission module]{.underline}**, which has
partially met its initial operational capability goal but not fully,
**[saw a 45 percent cut, or \$12 million]{.underline}**, coming from
surface-to-surface missile modules. And the **[anti-submarine warfare
mission module saw a more modest 11 percent cut]{.underline}** to
address cost overruns with the variable depth sonar.

In total, **[Congress slashed about \$145.5 million from the mission
modules when you include general equipment that comes with all the
modules, or 52 percent of the total Navy request.]{.underline}**

The current fleet stands at 298 ships. However, Gilday told the Senate

Gilday said it\'s smarter **[to invest now in newer, more sophisticated

\"We **[cannot field a fleet larger than one we can

Navy's top officer and two successive civilian administrations have
repeatedly [said](https://archive.ph/o/2BLyQ/https:/news.usni.org/2022/02/18/cno-gilday-we-need-a-naval-force-of-over-500-ships) that
the Navy must grow to 500 ships, up from 298 vessels today. Otherwise,
the **[Navy will simply not be equipped to do the jobs demanded of
it.]{.underline}**  

The logic of **[cutting the fleet size today in order to fund its future
growth is not finding traction among knowledgeable observers on either
side of the aisle.]{.underline}** It simply doesn\'t make any sense.
"HINT: If you want to grow the Navy, **[stop decommissioning more ships
than you build]{.underline}**," tweeted Representative Elaine Luria, a
Democrat from Virginia who serves as Vice Chair of the House Arms
Services Committee.

Ms. Luria is a Naval Academy graduate who spent twenty years as a
surface warfare officer. She didn't hold back or couch her tweets in
conventional political rhetoric, "I have delayed putting out a statement
about the Defense Budget because frankly it would have been mostly full
of words you might expect from a Sailor, but here goes**[: It
sucks]{.underline}**."

Ms. Luria added: "The **[Navy will be losing 1000-plus vertical launch
system missile cells, with no plan to replace them]{.underline}**.
Instead, the Navy is **[investing in the next 'Gucci' missile and
technology that will not be mature for 20-plus years. The Navy has no
strategy."]{.underline}**

Senator Inhofe, the **[ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services
Committee not only questioned the Navy's logic but believes the real
number may be only eight new builds because  the Pentagon may
be [double-counting](https://archive.ph/o/2BLyQ/https:/breakingdefense.com/2022/03/navys-shipbuilding-request-may-be-violation-of-law-inhofe-warns/?mc_cid=de8752221a&mc_eid=4bc9404c92) an

The Navy's **[portion of the proposed \$773 billion Defense budget is

rate of 7.9 percent.]{.underline}** Given this level of spending, the

mimou\]

**[Sharp divisions over the adequacy of President Joe Biden's fiscal
2023 request for the Navy's shipbuilding budget emerged]{.underline}**
at two House hearings Wednesday.

The differences, which fell largely along party lines, were manifest at
a House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense budget hearing with the
Pentagon top brass and a House Armed Services Committee hearing with the
leaders of the Navy and Marine Corps.

At the Defense Appropriations hearing, the **[top Republican
appropriator]{.underline}**, [Kay
Granger](https://www.rollcall.com/members/469?utm_source=memberLinks&utm_medium=memberlinks&personid=469) of
Texas, and the **[ranking Republican member of the Defense
panel]{.underline}**, [Ken
Calvert](https://www.rollcall.com/members/70?utm_source=memberLinks&utm_medium=memberlinks&personid=70) of
California, **[complained the Navy would decommission significantly more
ships in fiscal 2023]{.underline}** than it plans to procure, while
China's fleet is already larger --- and growing more rapidly --- than
America's.

But **[[Betty
McCollum](https://www.rollcall.com/members/8151?utm_source=memberLinks&utm_medium=memberlinks&personid=8151),
D-Minn.]{.underline}**, the Appropriations subcommittee's chairwoman,
sought to **[rebut these arguments by noting that nearly half of China's
larger Navy is made up of relatively small, support
ships]{.underline}**. She also noted that America's allies in Asia have
plenty of warships to bring to any fight. 

A **[similar debate took place Wednesday at the House Armed Services
Committee]{.underline}**. Virginia **[Democrat [Elaine
Luria](https://www.rollcall.com/members/118568?utm_source=memberLinks&utm_medium=memberlinks&personid=118568) joined
several of her GOP colleagues in taking issue with the declining U.S.
fleet size. ]{.underline}**

The \$**[27.8 billion fiscal 2023 Navy budget would fund nine new
warships, the administration has said]{.underline}**. But **[24 ships
are being retired, for a net loss of 15. ]{.underline}**

The nine ships in the Freedom class of Littoral Combat Ships are a
high-profile example of the decommissionings. 

But Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday said at the committee
hearing that the **[Navy is using the \$3.6 billion saved from
retirements over the next five years on new ships and more modern
weapons]{.underline}** --- **[which he called "systems that
matter.\"]{.underline}**

The **[decision on which ships to retire was driven largely by whether
the Navy could "count on them to actually move the needle in a high end
fight with an adversary like China]{.underline}**,\" Gilday said.

From Ukraine to China

The House Appropriations subcommittee hearing ran the gamut of subjects,
from troops' housing costs to cyberwarfare. 

The conflict in Ukraine was a hot topic. Asked if the war could escalate
into a conflict between Russia and NATO, Defense Secretary Lloyd J.
Austin III said Russian President Vladimir Putin "doesn't want to take
on the NATO alliance." 

Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
Russia has fired hypersonic missiles in Ukraine, but the weapons have
not created "significant or game-changing effects."

McCollum, meanwhile, said at the end of the hearing that she supports
another round of base closings to reduce excess infrastructure, which
she said is 20 percent by one estimate.  

But the **[shipbuilding issue was front and center]{.underline}** for
members of both parties at both House hearings Wednesday. 

At the Appropriations hearing, **[Calvert predicted "glaring capability
gaps" as a result of a shrinking fleet]{.underline}**, noting also that
hundreds of military aircraft would be retired under Biden's fiscal 2023
plan. Calvert said **[China is building 22 ships this year to America\'s
nine.]{.underline}**

China has 355 ships in total and is projected to have 460 by 2030,
according to a Pentagon report last fall.

The U.S. Navy, by comparison, would drop from 298 ships today to 280 by
2027 under the Biden plan. 

Granger **[asked the department's leaders why they would "mothball" the
LCS ships under these circumstances]{.underline}**, saying she has
"**[serious concerns about the way that was determined]{.underline}**."

Milley replied that the issue \"comes down to balance in terms of
what\'s affordable and what the Navy can afford and what the Department
of Defense can afford."

Austin said the overall budget "maintains our edge but does not take
that edge for granted."

Numbers game

McCollum, meanwhile, said she is interested in exploring possible new
uses for at least some of the Littoral Combat Ships that are facing
early retirement.

But she pushed back at length against the GOP argument that America's
Navy is a shadow of China's. And she made a rarely heard point: that
trying to catch up in quantity is a vain effort.

"There's a simple fact here: The **[United States does not have the
shipbuilding industrial base to manufacture, let alone
maintain]{.underline}**, a **[Navy that can completely]{.underline}**
--- numerically --- **[compete with China]{.underline}**," McCollum
said. "But **[quantity alone is not the point]{.underline}**. It's
**[quality and capability that matter]{.underline}**, as you gentlemen
pointed out," she said to Austin and Milley, who were joined by Defense
Department Comptroller Mike McCord. 

She then noted that China's fleet --- which she put at 500 ships --- is
comprised of 230 smaller support vessels. She also noted that three of
America's allies in the region --- Japan, South Korea and Australia
--- have fleets totaling more than 350 ships combined, though she
acknowledged some of those are smaller too.

"The debate I believe needs to be very substantiated, and not just
picking a number that we think might be for the right number of ships
for the U.S. to have," she added.

She also alluded to the need to get ships in and out of maintenance
faster, so that the actual number of deployed ships can grow. 

'**[Systems that matter']{.underline}**

Meanwhile, at the House Armed Services Committee, **[several Republicans
joined Luria in voicing concern about the U.S. fleet
size: ]{.underline}**[Mike D.
Rogers](https://www.rollcall.com/members/15323?utm_source=memberLinks&utm_medium=memberlinks&personid=15323) of

Wisconsin and [Michael
Waltz](https://www.rollcall.com/members/119499?utm_source=memberLinks&utm_medium=memberlinks&personid=119499) of
Florida.

But **[Gilday, the Navy's top admiral]{.underline}**, replied that
**[the radar on older cruisers being retired can't see the threat,
leaving them vulnerable.]{.underline}** Similarly, **[the anti-submarine
warfare system on the nine Littoral Combat Ships the Navy wants to
decommission]{.underline}** "**[did not work out
technically]{.underline}**," he said.

"After about a year and a half \[of\] study, I **[refuse to put an
additional dollar against a system that would not be able to track a
high-end submarine in today's environment]{.underline}**,"
**[Gilday]{.underline}** said.

In late April, **[Massachusetts-based businessman Qin
Shuren]{.underline}** became the **[latest person to plead
guilty]{.underline}** in the Justice Department's **[crackdown on the
illegal export of strategic technologies.]{.underline}** Qin's company,
LinkOcean Technologies, falsified documentation to send a Chinese
military-affiliated university some \$100,000 worth of equipment,
including hydrophones, sonobuoys, side-scan sonars, and even an
autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The **[case is just one part of
a]{.underline}** **[long trail of open-source evidence]{.underline}**
that **[illustrates a larger issue]{.underline}**: U**[.S. technology
being used to advance Chinese military ends.]{.underline}**

The trail begins with the Justice Department's press release, which says
that Mr. Qin was working at the direction of Northwestern Polytechnical
University, in the northwest Chinese city of Xi'an. NWPU is one of the
"Seven Sons of National Defense," a group of universities known for
particularly close ties to the People's Liberation Army and which
contribute a high proportion of China's defense workforce and research.
For two decades, NWPU has been on the U.S. Department of Commerce Entity
List, the group of foreign organizations and individuals to which the
export of certain U.S. strategic technologies is restricted.

While the available court documents do not go into further specifics,
several of NWPU's defense labs work on areas related to Qin's case. The
**[Key Lab for Underwater Information and Control
conducts]{.underline}** a **[wide range of strategic underwater
research]{.underline}** into sensing, acoustics, information processing,
navigation, and communications for underwater vehicles**[, including
submarines]{.underline}** and AUVs. Along with its smaller sister, the
National Lab of Acoustic Engineering and Testing Technology, it manages
the Unmanned Navigation Technology Research Center in the eastern
coastal city of Ningbo. This **[center researches propulsion,
navigation, and acoustics for unmanned underwater
vehicle]{.underline}**s, the kind of **[research]{.underline}** that
**[needs the hydrophones, sonobuoys, sonars,]{.underline}** and AUVs
that Qin pled guilty to illegally procuring.

The court documents describe Qin's co-conspirator at NWPU as a professor
and maritime information processing expert named Yang. Notably, the Key
Lab is directed by Yang Yixin, who researches maritime information
processing.

Digging deeper, we learn that the lab occasionally goes by a second,
decidedly more military name: the Key Lab of Torpedo Guidance
Technology. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute first raised the
possibility that the two labs are one and the same, and our research
concurs, given the near-complete overlap in missions, personnel, and
associated organizations.

Moreover, this lab is actually jointly run by NWPU and the 705 Institute
of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation. The CSSC is China's largest
shipbuilding conglomerate and builder of all of its warships; its 705
Institute is the country's premier institution for torpedo research and
development. The institute's research underpins all of the torpedoes
currently in service with the People's Liberation Army Navy, including
its most advanced, the Yu-6, allegedly based on the design of the
American Mark 48 ADCAP. Unsurprisingly, it is also on the Entity List.

Despite being co-managed by two institutions that are under strict
export control, the Key Lab **[makes extensive use of American and other
foreign equipment in its research]{.underline}**. We know this because
the lab openly lists some of this gear on its website. It even helpfully
labels each piece with its brand and country of origin.

From this list, we learn that **[U.S. export controls]{.underline}**
ha**[ve not prevented the lab from acquiring high-end research
equipmen]{.underline}**t from various U.S. firms like Sun Microsystems,
Agilent Technologies, Tektronix, and Applied Dynamics International. The
equipment listed **[includes]{.underline}** **[servers, precision
instruments, advanced welding machines]{.underline}**, specialized
modems for acoustic communications, and, most notably of all, an entire
AUV from the American company OceanServer. This particular model of AUV,
the IVER-2-580-EP, is also used by the U.S. military for its own
underwater research. According to court documents, Mr. Qin approached
OceanServer about purchasing their AUV, but was allegedly turned down.
Nevertheless, NWPU and the UIC lab claim to have somehow managed to get
their hands on just such an AUV.

Why does all this matter, beyond connecting an admitted smuggler to a
Chinese defense lab full of U.S.-made equipment? **[The PLA Navy
is]{.underline}** **[already larger than the U.S. Navy]{.underline}**
**[in terms of raw ship numbers,]{.underline}** and the **[Americans'
qualitative edge is narrowing each year]{.underline}** **[as China
fields increasingly advanced and "smart" technologies,]{.underline}**
including torpedoes, mines, and UUVs. As highlighted by the case of Qin
Shuren, at least some of **[these advances]{.underline}** **[are being
made with the help of U.S. technology.]{.underline}** Sometimes the
technology is purchased on the open market and other times it is
**[gained through illicit means that range from cyber theft to
old-fashioned espionage and smuggling.]{.underline}**

Thus, the Qin Shuren case provides an instructive example of a much
bigger and ongoing story: **[American technology being put to work
advancing China's military]{.underline}**. It illuminates a threat that
is **[leading the U.S. government to extend limits on
trade]{.underline}** with and investment in Chinese companies that
"**[enable the development and modernization]{.underline}**" **[of
China's military]{.underline}** and "**[directly threaten" U.S.
security.]{.underline}** Indeed, the Biden administration just doubled
the number of companies on the restricted list to 59 from the Trump-era
31.

continued advances in sensor technology design (e.g., reduced size and
extended detection ranges) to overcome quieting challenges, other
technical challenges still remain. These include communicating
underwater between multiple systems, processing power requirements,
generating battery life and energy, and scaling the system.65 While some
experts do not expect a technically reliable and effective capability of
this kind will be operational for at least a decade, others are more
optimistic.66 From a tactical perspective, drone swarms would not need
ocean-wide coverage (or full ocean transparency) to effectively detect
and track submarines. According to UK rear admiral John Gower, a
relatively even spread of sensors might be sufficient to enable "a
viable search and detection plan . . . conceived for the open ocean"
(emphasis added).67 Moreover, advances in mobile sensing platforms could
enable drones in swarms to locate submarines through chokepoints (or
gateways) as they emerge from ports. Due to the current slowness of
drones with extended sea ranges, however, trailing them autonomously
seems implausible.68 **[Future iterations of machine-learning-augmented
UUVs and USVs may eventually complement, and perhaps replace entirely,
the traditional role of general-purpose nuclear-powered
submarines]{.underline}** (SSN) and manned surface vehicles in tracking

According to analyst Paul Scharre, "winning in swarm combat may depend
upon having the best algorithms to enable better coordination and faster
reaction times, rather than simply the best platforms" (emphasis

battlefield mass, **[[AWSs]{.mark} will [offer states]{.mark} attractive

neural networks, China's manned and unmanned drone teaming operations
could potentially impede future US freedom of navigation operations in
the South China Seas.74 Its air- and sea-based drones linked to
sophisticated neural networks could, for example, support the People's
Liberation Army's manned and unmanned teaming operations. Were China to
infuse its cruise missiles and hypersonic glide capabilities with AI and
autonomy, close-range encounters in the Taiwan Straits and the East and
South China Seas would become more complicated, accident-prone, and
destabilizing---at both a conventional and nuclear level.75 China is
reportedly developing and deploying UUVs to bolster its underwater
monitoring and antisubmarine capabilities as part of a broader goal to
establish an "underwater Great Wall" to challenge US undersea military
primacy. **[[US AI-enhanced]{.mark} [UUVs]{.mark} could, for example,

Then there is Beijing's buildup. **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[may

**[fractional orbital bombardment]{.underline}**
**[system]{.underline}** (in essence, a nuclear-weapon delivery system
that orbits the earth before plunging toward its target) **[is only part
of a much larger endeavor]{.underline}**.

**[China]{.underline}** is now **[building]{.underline}** a more secure
and **[[sophisticated]{.underline}]{.mark}** "**[nuclear
[triad]{.mark}]{.underline}**" --- a combination of nuclear-capable
bombers, ground-based intercontinental missiles and submarine-launched

[more than]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[1,000]{.mark} deliverable
[warheads]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[by 2030]{.underline}** --- an
arsenal worthy of a superpower.

The **[return of great-power competition]{.underline}** **[has brought
with it the return of nuclear rivalry]{.underline}**. Meanwhile,
conventional weakness is making nuclear weapons even more important to
U.S. strategy.

Over the past two decades, **[Russian and Chinese conventional buildups
have]{.underline}** **[[dramatically altered]{.mark} the [balance of
power]{.mark}]{.underline}** in Eastern Europe and the Western Pacific.
Washington **[and its [allies]{.mark} [might struggle]{.mark} to defeat
a determined]{.underline}** Russian **[attack]{.underline}** on Estonia
or a Chinese assault against Taiwan. An old question is becoming newly
relevant: Would the U.S. start a nuclear war to avoid losing a
conventional one?

The **[[likelihood]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[of]{.underline}]{.mark}**
a **[great-power [war]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[going]{.underline}**
**[nuclear]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[is]{.underline}** **[[significantly

[most]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[Americans]{.underline}** **[probably

attacked Taiwan, it **[[would]{.mark} probably [use]{.mark} its
conventional [missiles to maul]{.mark} [America's]{.mark} air and naval
[assets]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Pacific. Within days, the U.S.
might face a choice between seeing Taiwan defeated or using low-yield
nuclear weapons against Chinese ports, airfields or invasion fleets.

Alternatively, **[if a U.S.-China war turned into a bloody
stalemate]{.underline}**, American **[leaders might be tempted to
[use]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[nuclear threats]{.underline}**
**[or]{.underline}** **[strikes]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to
batter]{.underline}** the Chinese **[into conceding
defeat]{.underline}**. Does this sound crazy? Washington repeatedly
considered nuclear strikes against China the last time the two countries
fought a stalemated war, in Korea.

**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** might also **[[have incentives]{.mark}
to go nuclear]{.underline}**. Starting, and then **[[losing, a war
against]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark} could be a [fatal
mistake]{.mark}]{.underline}** for President Xi Jinping. If an invasion
of Taiwan faltered, **[[Beijing]{.mark} could [try to turn the
tide]{.mark}, or simply convince America to quit, [by firing]{.mark}
nuclear-tipped [missiles]{.mark} at or near Guam or another important
U.S. military facility in the region]{.underline}**. Such coercive uses
of nuclear weapons may be what China has in mind in enlarging its
arsenal today.

**[Transparency does not have to be synoptic to make submarines
vulnerable]{.underline}**. The small number of SSBNs each national

means that **[sensing technologies can achieve functional transparency
before they achieve global-scale transparency]{.underline}**. 161 AUV
platforms in particular could pick up a submarine as it exits its base
or transits maritime chokepoints, and then track its course
automatically.162 This **[situation]{.underline}**, **[where a state
locates all of its rival's SSBNs today, but may not be able to keep
track of them tomorrow, is particularly destabilizing]{.underline}**. A
**[closing window of first strike opportunity increases crisis
instability]{.underline}**, which is why **[forces that are always
invulnerable are best for stability]{.underline}**.163 There are many
other possible ways that **[military actors may respond to increasing
ocean transparency.]{.underline}** The isolated, open-ocean patrols that
**[formerly hid SSBNs safely under the surface may become a thing of the
past]{.underline}**. The bastion strategy could be adopted by all major
nuclear powers, such that SSBNs are kept in noisy, covered, or
well-defended areas. **[Large swarms of AUVs may travel in convoys
around SSBNs to disrupt localization by acoustic or non-acoustic
measures.]{.underline}** Fear of **[transparency could lead vulnerable
nuclear powers to target communications nodes that enable networked
sensing, or develop techniques to trawl AUVs out of certain
areas]{.underline}**. Attempts to sustain survivability could be
relatively simple -- such as investing in mobile ICBMs or **[adopting
"launch on warning" postures]{.underline}** -- or complex, involving ASW
measures and counter-measures without one having a clear advantage. Any
of these scenarios represent a **[significant risk of
instability.]{.underline}** Conclusion **[If ocean transparency made
nuclear strategic submarines more detectable, locatable, and
targetable]{.underline}**, the **[military and political implications
would be significant]{.underline}**. Yet the topic of SSBN vulnerability
is "virtually taboo" in the US Navy's public documents. 164 A culture of
complacency has set in regarding the role and missions of SSBNs, such
that submariners are poorly equipped to adjust to potentially novel
operational realities. 165 Other countries are walking the same path:
the planned **[development of SSBNs by India and Pakistan is driven by a
judgment about their superior and durable survivability]{.underline}**.
166 This paper challenges the assumption that extrapolations from the
past can serve as reliable guides for the future. Specifically, the
**[security of second-strike capabilities, and therefore the assurance
of mutual destruction]{.underline}**, **[rests on fluid material
foundations]{.underline}**. Whether the **[potential obsolescence of
"hiding" technologies occurs as a slow erosion of
usefulness]{.underline}**, or an **[avalanche of

nuclear strategic stability.]{.underline}** The possibility of, and
reactions to, ocean transparency present a challenge for the prevailing
arms control regime. The **[force structures created and shaped by

SSBNs as the foundation of nuclear deterrence]{.underline}**. If
**[transparency were to arrive as a "technological
surprise]{.underline}**," this feature of the regime **[sets the stage
for instability.]{.underline}**167 The responses to transparency
described in the final section each have **[negative implications for
the existing arms control regime]{.underline}**. Without
invulnerability, **[nuclear states may pursue a "safety in numbers"
approach to achieving a secure second strike]{.underline}**, which would
**[require a substantial buildup in weaponry]{.underline}**. The pursuit
of **["launch on warning" postures conflicts with the arms control
agenda of "lengthening the fuse."]{.underline}**168 If **["mutually
assured destruction" were abandoned wholesale, the possible return to a
"war strategism"]{.underline}** approach that **[sees nuclear weapons as
usable would be especially detrimental to the arms control
agenda]{.underline}**. An arms control regime that accounts for the
possible **[erosion of transparency might replicate the Treaty on Open

Nuclear deterrence rests on the ability of strategic assets to survive
an enemy's first strike and to retaliate, ensuring mutually assured
destruction. Nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines
(**[[SSBNs]{.mark}) are considered to be the most survivable of all
nuclear platforms]{.underline}** due to their stealth capabilities,
mobility and discretion. **[[Placing nuclear assets]{.mark} [underwater
puts them]{.mark} at a [safer]{.mark} distance [from a]{.mark} crippling
[first strike]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But **[as technology
improves]{.underline}** and the ocean battlefield becomes more complex,
these **[[advances]{.mark} could [undermine]{.mark} the
[survivability]{.mark} of strategic forces around the
world]{.underline}** and make them far more vulnerable. Emerging
technologies like unmanned underwater vehicles **[([UUVs]{.mark}) add to
the complexity of the battle space]{.underline}** and disrupt the status
quo. **[Swarms of autonomous underwater drones could be deployed to
[hunt ballistic-missile sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
targeting **[a [cornerstone of]{.mark} nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In their
2017 [article](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/new-era-counterforce-technological-change-and-future-nuclear-deterrence) 'The
new era of counterforce', Keir A. Lieber and Daryl Press argue that for
most of the nuclear age, the survivability of retaliatory forces seemed
straightforward. However, improvements in **[counterforce technology
have [eroded]{.mark} this cornerstone of nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As new technology continues to raise
the potential for major shifts in the military realm, the rapid advent
of these **[[drones]{.mark} may [reduce]{.mark} the credibility and
[effectiveness of SSBNs]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[UUVs can function
without the direction of a human operator]{.underline}** and have
wide [dual-use (that is, civilian and military)
applications](https://www.simulyze.com/blog/from-land-to-sea-5-ways-drones-are-impacting-underwater-operations).
Some are used for commercial purposes, hydrography and oceanographic

rigs and underwater pipelines, a task that's worth around a billion
dollars a year in the Gulf of Mexico. But UUV technologies have been
evolving from defensive to more offensive roles. **[UUVs increasingly

warfare](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2014/0716/Military-ramps-up-use-of-underwater-drones.-What-do-they-do) ([ASW]{.mark})]{.underline}**

Claims that **[AI could generate a "transparent ocean"112 or "selective
ocean transparency"113 likely overstate the ability of low-cost UUVs,
USVs, and UAVs]{.underline}** to conduct these steps. First, in order to
be low-cost, **[uninhabited vehicles are generally of limited size,
weight, and power (SWaP) capacity]{.underline}**, at least relative to
traditional attack submarines. These facts, combined with the
**[inherent physics-based difficulties of sensing in the undersea
environment]{.underline}**,114 mean that the **[sensors carried by any
given low-cost UUV, USV, or UAV will be of limited detection range
regardless of the phenomenologies they employ]{.underline}**.115 Given
the sensors' **[limited range]{.underline}**, ASW **[forces
would]{.underline}** **[need to deploy large numbers of sensor vehicles
to seamlessly cover even small oceanic areas]{.underline}**.116 UUVs
**[in particular are limited in endurance, because of their need to rely
on air-independent power sources such as batteries or fuel
cells.]{.underline}** This means that **[additional UUVs would be needed
to sustain a track on a submarine over time]{.underline}**, as UUVs
reach the end of the their operational endurance and need to return to
base. (Ultra-long endurance UUV power solutions, such as thermal gliders
that draw energy from ocean thermoclines, lack sufficient speed and
power to maintain track on a submarine.117) While fleets of UUVs, USVs,
and UAVs are likely to have cost-savings relative to traditional assets
and will be valuable supplements in a "high-low mix" of ASW
capabilities, the **[scale of assets needed to render even a portion of
the ocean "transparent" would likely be enormous]{.underline}**. Setting
cost and practicality aside, **[ASW forces would also have to keep these
sensors appropriately positioned to maintain high-confidence area
surveillance and target tracking]{.underline}**. This would **[require a
level of multi-system control reliability and resilience not yet
demonstrated.]{.underline}**118 Fewer sensors would be required to
monitor ocean chokepoints. But **[only Chinese and British SSBNs must
pass through chokepoints to hold their primary targets at
risk]{.underline}** -- and **[both countries have offset this
risk.]{.underline}** Although Chinese SSBNs **[would need to pass
through chokepoints in the First Island Chain]{.underline}** to cover
the entire United States, **[China's land-based mobile ICBM force can
cover targets at that range.]{.underline}** Likewise, British SSBNs must
pass through chokepoints to the north or south of Ireland to reach deep
waters. But, as British Rear Admiral John Gower has written, monitoring
those chokepoints would probably still require a high number of
sensors.119 And the costs of maintaining or cycling those systems would
still be high. Furthermore -- and crucially -- **[any UUVs, USVs, or
UAVs deployed in the chokepoints would be subject to countermeasures
employed on an adaptive basis, including improved stealth, jamming,
multi-phenomenology decoys and spoofing, evasive maneuvers, or outright
destruction by SSBN protection forces]{.underline}**.120 Many of the
**[same countermeasures could also be used against sensors operating in
the open ocean]{.underline}**. **[Even if ASW forces were able to
maintain optimal sensor coverage in the search area, they would then
face problems of data transmission]{.underline}** that **[automation is
ill suited to solve]{.underline}**. The UUVs, USVs, and UAVs sent to
monitor the open ocean or a chokepoint **[must be able to share data --
processed or raw -- amongst themselves -- directly or through command
nodes]{.underline}** -- **[in a timely manner in order to maintain
coverage, cue and direct searches, confidently classify a contact as an
SSBN, and then support weapons employment against the
SSBN]{.underline}**. In order to be used effectively, any vehicle that
attains a track on an SSBN **[would need to be able to transmit that
data to another vehicle.]{.underline}**121 While highly automated
network management technologies may be able to enhance communications
resilience between uninhabited -- or uninhabited and inhabited -- ASW
platforms,122 such **[data transmission will remain a vulnerability for
any undersea communications]{.underline}**.123 It bears noting that the
**[physics of undersea communications results in fairly short range
communications paths at low data rates]{.underline}**. **[Longer range
communications paths and higher data rates forces reliance on surface or
airborne communications relays that are vulnerable to jamming or other
interference.]{.underline}** **[Even temporary or partial delays in data
transmission could undermine ASW forces' abilities to localize an
SSBN]{.underline}** -- and given that the **[window of opportunity to
localize a submarine may be very short]{.underline}**, an **[inopportune
communications delay or disruption may make the
difference]{.underline}** between **[ASW success and
failure]{.underline}**.124 Finally, if we **[assume that ASW forces
relying on UUVs, USVs, and UAVs were able to confidently classify and
localize an SSBN]{.underline}** in their search area, they **[would need
to maintain localization long enough for an ASW weapons-carrying
platform to close within attack range of the SSBN and successfully
engage]{.underline}** it. If a weapons-carrying platform is located
close by, for instance, near a chokepoint through which a SSBN is
transiting and where that SSBN's protection forces are unable provide
effective coverage -- again, an implausible scenario for reasons of both
geography and nuclear force structure for all nuclear-armed states --
this may be a relatively easy problem to solve. However, if the search
is occurring in the open ocean, the **[sheer expanse of that area
suggests that a weapons-carrying platform is unlikely to be within
immediately-actionable proximity of the SSBN when confident
classification is made.]{.underline}**125 Automated protocols might
reduce the time required to signal and dispatch an ASW weaponscarrying
platform. But **[the weapons-carrying platform's transit time alone
would leave a window for the SSBN's crew to conduct
countermeasures]{.underline}**---or for inherently dynamic underwater
conditions to **[degrade the ability of the sensors in contact to
maintain track.]{.underline}** This time window could be reduced by
arming uninhabited vehicles directly. Nevertheless, **[the problems of
coordinating multiple vehicles, at scale, for an extended period of
time,]{.underline}** and **[robustly in a challenging communications
environment amidst adversary countermeasures remains]{.underline}**. If
**[ASW forces miss any of these steps, then they will be unable to
detect, classify, localize, and engage the SSBN]{.underline}**. To
successfully prosecute a disarming first strike against a nation's
entire SSBN fleet, **[an opposing nation's ASW forces would need to
execute the entire kill chain for every one of those boats -- and
probably near-simultaneously to avoid triggering fleet-wide
countermeasures]{.underline}** (which would **[render subsequent ASW
operations even more difficult) or strategic
escalation]{.underline}**.126

The **[U.S.-Russia relationship is defined by Russian fear of its own
weaknesses]{.underline}** (economic, technological, etc.) and paranoia
about U.S. and NATO threats to its security. **[Russia currently fears
U.S. conventional superiority]{.underline}**20 and has invested in
capabilities and tactics to circumvent it.21 It is **[embarking on a
modernization program for its nuclear weapons]{.underline}** in part
**[because it feels insecure about the survivability of its nuclear
forces]{.underline}** as the United States increases its progress on
ballistic missile defense. **[If the United States were able to track
Russian nuclear-armed submarines with increased confidence, it could
exacerbate these Russian fears even more, causing Russia to respond in
destabilizing ways]{.underline}**. While it is true that Russia has
never relied as much on submarine-based weapons as the United States
has, **[the degradation of the survivability of Russia's nuclear-armed
submarines would likely cause Russia to compensate for this new
vulnerability.]{.underline}** This is especially true if continued
advancements in precision strike make Russia's air- and land-based
nuclear forces more vulnerable. If **[Russia can no longer rely on
hardening and concealment for survivability]{.underline}**, they **[may
double down on redundancy, producing and deploying larger numbers of
nuclear weapons]{.underline}** to **[complicate U.S. targeting and
increase the odds that a retaliatory capability survives any U.S. first
strike]{.underline}**. This, in turn, could put the **[final nail in the
coffin of arms control and lead to an arms race with the United States
that drains resources]{.underline}**, **[intensifies mistrust, and makes
miscalculation more likely.]{.underline}** In short, **[a significant
U.S. advantage in submarine detection]{.underline}** (which would
**[likely]{.underline}** **[develop in parallel with a U.S. advantage in
remote sensing and precision strike capabilities in other
domains]{.underline}**) would **[likely be destabilizing due to Russian
sensitivity over its technological inferiority]{.underline}**. This
could compel Russia not only to **[increase redundancy with a larger
number of warheads]{.underline}**, but to **[change the doctrine
governing their use as well]{.underline}**. It is possible that in an
environment of degraded second-strike stability, Russia **[could move
further towards a first-use doctrine]{.underline}** to deter escalation
and **[to avoid the "lose them or lose them" dilemma]{.underline}**.
China would likely be less sensitive to advancements in U.S. submarine
detection capabilities for two reasons. First, China's strategic
relationship with the United States, at least currently, is not defined
by an assumed need for parity but by a need for a minimum reprisal
capability, which it believes it has and will continue to have in the
future.22 It currently has a much smaller nuclear arsenal than the
United States and relies on hardened and road-mobile land-based ICBMs
for its retaliatory capability, which it believes is sufficient as long
as it can hit the United States with just a few nuclear warheads, or
even a single nuclear warhead.23 Second, China has not historically
relied on SSBNs for its second-strike capability, and even as it begins
deploying a credible sea-based nuclear deterrent for the first time,24
it recognizes that its submarines are less advanced and thus more
vulnerable to ASW than U.S. submarines. Therefore, China will likely
continue to rely on land-based nuclear forces.25 The remote sensing and
precision strike revolution will certainly have implications for
U.S.-China relations, but in the narrow hypothetical of U.S. superiority
in submarine detection, **[China]{.underline}** would be less concerned
than Russia. They **[may, however, be sufficiently concerned that they
decide to expand the size of their arsenal as a hedge]{.underline}**.
Overall, **[conditions under which the United States had a significant
advantage in submarine detection]{.underline}** could **[push some
adversaries away from an assured retaliation nuclear
posture]{.underline}** and **[towards]{.underline}** what Vipin Narang
calls an **[asymmetric escalation nuclear posture.]{.underline}**26 An
**[asymmetric escalation nuclear posture entails threatening to use
nuclear weapons first in a]{.underline}** **[conflict to deter
conflict]{.underline}** and to prevent successful counterforce targeting
by an adversary. If nations currently predisposed towards adopting
assured retaliation postures no longer feel that the second-strike
forces necessary for such a posture are secure, they **[may be forced to
adopt asymmetric escalation postures]{.underline}**.

The Most Survivable Leg of the Triad? **[A more transparent ocean would

in the event of an adversary's large-scale nuclear

limited ability of sensors to track all subs all the
time]{.underline}**. If sensor technology coupled with other military
capabilities overcomes this challenge, submarines will lose much of
their stealth. An adversary could launch a successful strike without
fear of retaliation, because each nuclear submarine could be targeted
and destroyed. **[Even without complete transparency, a window may open

In recent years, the maturity of military artificial intelligence (AI)
has advanced rapidly. Open source information indicates that the United
States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, Japan and the
Republic of Korea (South Korea), among other countries, are engaged in
such developments. **[Among the weapons and equipment that have been
deployed in various countries]{.underline}**, unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs), **[unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), unmanned surface
vessels,]{.underline}** battlefield robots and other platforms have been
put into use. **[AI technology based on big data, cloud computing,
neural network-based deep learning, computer vision, intelligent robots,
natural language processing and speech is of great military
value]{.underline}**. **[It can play a key role in intelligence
monitoring and reconnaissance]{.underline}**, target recog nition,
communication and navigation, automated command and control, firepower
strikes, and cyber-electromagnetic countermeasures. **[Because AI
enables improvement in the operational effectiveness of weapons and
equipment, the future format of warfare is likely to be
altered]{.underline}**. This essay first analyses (in section I) how AI
technology is shaping strategic weaponry in terms of strategic
reconnaissance, missile defence, and nuclear command, control and
communications (NC3). It then (in sections II and III) reviews these
AI-related developments in the realm of cyberspace and lethal autono
mous weapon systems (LAWS). It concludes (in section IV) by suggesting
means of mitigating the negative impact of some of these developments on
traditional arms control. I. Strategic weapons Missile defence and
strategic reconnaissance AI can improve the effectiveness of missile
defence and enhance target recognition, trajectory calculation and
judgement of damage effects. It thereby improves the ability of
countries with missile defence systems to offset their opponents'
nuclear retaliation. Further, the **[application of AI technology has a
marked impact on strategic stability among nuclear powers and may
undermine the mutual vulnerability and strategic stability of
nuclear-armed states of unequal power]{.underline}**. Because AI boasts
strong capabilities in image and pattern recognition, similar to facial
recognition, its ability to recognize still images is strong and it will
greatly enhance the effective ness of strategic reconnaissance. **[By
improving the ability to interpret the impact of ai on strategic
stability and nuclear risk satellite images and the deep reconnaissance
of long-distance UAVs, the country that possesses nuclear superiority
will be able to gain further intelligence on the basic characteristics
and procedures of its opponent's nuclear force deployment and
movements]{.underline}**. **[This will enhance a country's confidence in
its ability to disarm its opponent's nuclear weapons with a first
strike]{.underline}**. When there is a large gap between the nuclear
forces of the two countries, this situation will make a preemptive
strike by the more powerful one more advantageous, thus weakening the
strategic stability of the two countries during a crisis. **[At sea, AI
technology can be used to improve the capability to collect and process
a submarine's sound signature. In anti-submarine warfare, UUVs can also
be used to conduct close-range reconnaissance, which can strengthen the
capacity to detect and recognize enemy nuclear-powered ballistic missile
submarines (SSBNs).]{.underline}** On the one hand, this reduces the
survivability of the enemy SSBNs, thereby weakening the effectiveness of
nuclear deterrence and reducing strategic stability.1 On the other hand,
this AI technology can reduce the probability of accidental nuclear war:
by improving the ability to identify SSBNs, a country can avoid
accidentally hitting an SSBN as part of conventional anti-submarine
warfare. **[Facing the huge quantitative and qualitative advantages of
the USA in nuclear weapons, China has maintained a slim and effective
retaliatory nuclear force based on mobile strategic missiles with
relatively strong concealment, manoeuvrability and
survivability]{.underline}**. **[This force is predicated on increasing
the opponent's 'first-strike uncertainty']{.underline}**
(第一次打击的不确定性) to **[ensure credible deterrence]{.underline}**.2
**[However, once the USA is able to effectively employ AI technology to
improve its reconnaissance capabilities against China's mobile strategic
missiles---enabling discovery of deployment rules, manoeuvring routes
and launch site locations---this 'first strike uncertainty' would be
eliminated]{.underline}**. The **[USA would thereby gain the advantage
of being able to decapitate China's nuclear arsenal]{.underline}**.
**[To overcome concerns over this potential, China would have
to]{.underline}** **[increase the alert level of its nuclear weapons to
ensure the credibility of its deterrent]{.underline}**. **[This would
lead to a state in which both sides tend toward pre-emption, weakening
the strategic stability of the two countries and increasing the risk of
nuclear conflict.]{.underline}** **[In the case of sea-based nuclear
deterrence, the employment of AI-based detection technology and
offensive UUVs may also have similar effects]{.underline}**. **[In
particular, due to the difficulty of underwater communication, it would
be difficult for these weapon platforms to receive onshore command and
control signals in a timely manner. This would make it difficult to
control, much less recall such platforms when engaged in
operations.]{.underline}**

(or even from another submarine) is a challenging operation even in
relatively benign conditions68 because of the stealth technology --
especially minimal acoustic signatures -- of modern diesel-electric
submarines (SSKs) and SSBNs, along with the immense challenge of
coordinating such an operation.69 While some experts do not expect a
technically reliable and effective capability of this kind to be
operational for at least a decade, **[others are more
optimistic]{.underline}**.70 From a tactical perspective, **[drone
[swarms]{.mark} would not need ocean-wide coverage]{.underline}** (or

observes that, **[to date, the main U.S. objective in using UUVs for ASW

EO

**[Nuclear war has no winner]{.underline}**. Beginning in 2006, several
of **[the world's leading climatologists]{.underline}** (at Rutgers,
UCLA, John Hopkins University, and the University of Colorado-Boulder)
**[published a series of studies that evaluated the long-term
environmental consequences of a nuclear war]{.underline}**, including
baseline scenarios fought with **[merely 1% of the
explosive]{.underline}** power in the US and/or Russian launch-ready
nuclear arsenals. **[They concluded that the consequences of [even a
"small" nuclear war]{.mark} would include [catastrophic]{.mark}
disruptions of global climate and massive [destruction of]{.mark}
Earth's protective [ozone]{.mark} layer]{.underline}**. These and more
recent studies predict that global agriculture would be so negatively
affected by such a war, a global famine would result, which would cause
up to 2 billion people to starve to death. These peer-reviewed studies
-- which were analyzed by the best scientists in the world and found to
be without error -- also predict that a war fought with less than half
of US or Russian strategic **[nuclear weapons would [destroy the human
race]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In other words, a US-Russian nuclear war
would **[create such extreme long-term [damage to the]{.mark} global
[environment]{.mark} that it [would leave the Earth
uninhabitable]{.mark} for humans and most animal forms of
life]{.underline}**. A recent article in the Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, "Self-assured destruction: The climate impacts of nuclear
war," begins by stating: "**[A nuclear war]{.underline}** between Russia
and the United States, even after the arsenal reductions planned under
New START, **[could produce a nuclear winter. Hence, an attack by either
side could be suicidal, resulting in self-assured
destruction]{.underline}**." In 2009, I wrote "Catastrophic Climatic
Consequences of Nuclear Conflicts" for the International Commission on
Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament. The article summarizes the
findings of these studies. **[It explains that nuclear [firestorms would
produce millions of tons of smoke]{.mark}, which would rise above cloud
level and form a global stratospheric smoke layer that would rapidly
encircle the Earth. The smoke layer would remain for at least a decade,
and it would act to destroy the protective ozone layer]{.underline}**
(**[vastly increasing the UV-B reaching Earth]{.underline}**) **[as well
as block warming sunlight, thus [creating Ice Age]{.mark} weather
[conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}** that would last 10 years or longer.
Following a US-Russian nuclear war, **[temperatures]{.underline}** in
the central US and Eurasia **[would fall below freezing every
day]{.underline}** for one to three years**[; the intense cold would
completely eliminate growing seasons]{.underline}** for a decade or
longer. **[[No crops could be grown]{.mark}, leading to a famine that
would kill most humans and large animal populations.
[E]{.mark}lectro[m]{.mark}agnetic [p]{.mark}ulse from high-altitude
nuclear detonations would [destroy]{.mark} the integrated circuits in
all modern electronic devices, including those in commercial nuclear
[power plants. Every]{.mark} nuclear [reactor would]{.mark} almost
[instantly meltdown]{.mark}; every nuclear spent fuel
pool]{.underline}** (which contain many times more radioactivity than
found in the reactors) **[would boil off, releasing vast amounts of
long-lived radioactivity. [The]{.mark} [fallout]{.mark}]{.underline}**
would make most of the US and Europe
**[[uninhabitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Of course, **[the survivors of
the nuclear war would be starving to death]{.underline}** anyway. Once
nuclear weapons were introduced into a US-Russian conflict, there would
be little chance that a nuclear holocaust could be avoided. **[Theories
of "limited nuclear war" and "nuclear de-escalation" are
unrealistic]{.underline}**. In 2002 the Bush administration modified US
strategic doctrine from a retaliatory role to permit preemptive nuclear
attack; in 2010, the Obama administration made only incremental and
miniscule changes to this doctrine, leaving it essentially unchanged.
Furthermore, Counterforce doctrine -- used by both the US and Russian
military -- emphasizes the need for preemptive strikes once nuclear war
begins. Both sides would be under immense pressure to launch a
preemptive nuclear first-strike once military hostilities had commenced,
especially if nuclear weapons had already been used on the battlefield.
Both the US and Russia each have 400 to 500 launch-ready ballistic
missiles armed with a total of at least 1800 strategic nuclear warheads,
which can be launched with only a few minutes warning. Both the US and
Russian Presidents are accompanied 24/7 by military officers carrying a
"nuclear briefcase," which allows them to transmit the permission order
to launch in a matter of seconds. Yet top political leaders and
policymakers of both the US and Russia seem to be unaware that their
launch-ready nuclear weapons represent a self-destruct mechanism for the
human race. For example, in 2010, I was able to publicly question the
chief negotiators of the New START treaty, Russian Ambassador Anatoly
Antonov and (then) US Assistant Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller,
during their joint briefing at the UN (during the Non-Proliferation
Treaty Review Conference). I asked them if they were familiar with the
recent peer-reviewed studies that predicted the detonation of less than
1% of the explosive power contained in the operational and deployed US
and Russian nuclear forces would cause catastrophic changes in the
global climate, and that a nuclear war fought with their strategic
nuclear weapons would kill most people on Earth. They both answered
"no." More recently, on April 20, 2014, I asked the same question and
received the same answer from the US officials sent to brief
representatives of the NGOS at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Preparatory
Committee meeting at the UN. None of the US officials at the briefing
were aware of the studies. Those present included top officials of the
National Security Council. It is frightening that President Obama and
his administration appear unaware that the world's leading scientists
have for years predicted that a nuclear war fought with the US and/or
Russian strategic nuclear arsenal means the end of human history. Do
they not know of the existential threat these arsenals pose to the human
race . . . or do they choose to remain silent because this fact doesn't
fit into their official narratives? We hear only about terrorist threats
that could destroy a city with an atomic bomb, while the threat of human
extinction from nuclear war is never mentioned -- even when the US and
Russia are each running huge nuclear war games in preparation for a
US-Russian war. Even more frightening is the fact that the neocons
running **[US [foreign policy believe]{.mark} that [the US]{.mark} has
"nuclear primacy"]{.underline}** over Russia; **[that is, the US
[could]{.mark} successfully launch a nuclear sneak [attack]{.mark}
against]{.underline}** Russian (and [**[Chinese]{.underline}**)
**[nuclear]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[forces and completely destroy
them]{.underline}**. This theory was articulated in 2006 in "The Rise of
U.S. Nuclear Primacy," which was published in Foreign Affairs by the
Council on Foreign Relations. By concluding that the Russians and
Chinese would be unable to retaliate, or if some small part of their
forces remained, would not risk a second US attack by retaliating, the
article invites nuclear war. Colonel Valery Yarynich (who was in charge
of security of the Soviet/Russian nuclear command and control systems
for 7 years) asked me to help him write a rebuttal, which was titled
"**[[Nuclear Primacy]{.mark} is a Fallacy]{.underline}**." Colonel
Yarynich, who was on the Soviet General Staff and did war planning for
the USSR, concluded that the "**[Primacy]{.underline}**" article
**[[used faulty methodology]{.mark} and erroneous
assumptions]{.underline}**, thus invalidating its conclusions. My
contribution lay in my knowledge of the recently published (in 2006)
studies, which predicted **[[even a "successful" nuclear
first-strike]{.mark}, which destroyed 100% of the opposing side's
nuclear weapons, [would cause the]{.mark} citizens of [the side that
"won"]{.mark} the nuclear war [to perish from nuclear famine]{.mark},
just as would the rest of humanity]{.underline}**.

underwater vessels]{.underline}** (UUV), unmanned surface vessels (USV),
and UAVs **[supported by AI-enabled]{.underline}** intra-swarm
**[communication]{.underline}** **[and ISR systems could be deployed
simultaneously]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** both **[offensive and
defensive antisubmarine warfare operations to saturate an enemy's
defenses and to locate, disable, and destroy its nuclear-armed or
nonnuclear attack submarines.]{.underline}**64 Despite continued
advances in sensor technology design (e.g., reduced size and extended
detection ranges) to overcome quieting challenges, other technical
challenges still remain. These include communicating underwater between
multiple systems, processing power requirements, generating battery life
and energy, and scaling the system. 65 Q2019-07-08 AI Strategic
Stability 9958 13 While some experts do not expect a technically
reliable and effective capability of this kind will be operational for
at least a decade, others are more optimistic.66 From a tactical
perspective, drone swarms **[would not need ocean-wide
coverage]{.underline}** (or full ocean transparency)
**[to]{.underline}** effectively **[detect]{.underline}** **[and track
submarines]{.underline}**. According to UK rear admiral John Gower**[, a
relatively even spread of sensors might be sufficient to enable "a
viable search and detection plan . . . conceived for the open
ocean"]{.underline}** (emphasis added).67 Moreover, **[advances in
mobile sensing platforms could]{.underline}** enable drones in swarms to
**[locate submarines through chokepoints]{.underline}** (or gateways)
**[as they emerge from ports]{.underline}**. Due to the current slowness
of drones with extended sea ranges, however, trailing them autonomously
seems implausible.68 Future iterations of machine-learning-augmented
UUVs and USVs may eventually complement, and perhaps replace entirely,
the traditional role of general-purpose nuclear-powered submarines (SSN)
and manned surface vehicles in tracking and trailing submarines of
adversaries at chokepoints while simultaneously mounting sparsely
distributed and mobile distributed network systems (DNS) sensors on
UUVs. 69 **[If a state views the credibility of its survivable nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** (**[especially nuclear-armed submarines) to be at
risk]{.underline}**,70 conventional capabilities such as drone swarms
will **[likely have a destabilizing effect at a strategic
level]{.underline}**.71 **[Thus, even if]{.underline}** swarm sorties
were not **[intended]{.underline}** **[as]{.underline}** (or indeed
technically capable of**[) a disarming first strike]{.underline}**,
**[the perception alone of the feasibility of such an operation would be
destabilizing nonetheless]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[the speed of AI
could put the defender at a distinct disadvantage]{.underline}**,
**[creating additional incentives to strike first]{.underline}** **[(or
preemptively) technologically superior]{.underline}** **[military
rivals]{.underline}**. Consequently, the less secure a nation considers
its second-strike capabilities to be, the more likely it is to
countenance the use of autonomous systems within its nuclear weapons
complex to bolster the survivability of its strategic forces. According
to analyst Paul Scharre, "winning in swarm combat may depend upon having
the best algorithms to enable better coordination and faster reaction
times, rather than simply the best platforms" (emphasis added).72
Combining speed, persistence, scope, coordination, and battlefield mass,
AWS will offer states attractive asymmetric options to project military
power within contested A2/AD zones.73 Enhanced by sophisticated machine
learning neural networks, China's manned and unmanned drone teaming
operations could potentially impede future US freedom of navigation
operations in **[the South China Seas]{.underline}**.74 Its air- and
sea-based drones linked to sophisticated neural networks could, for
example, support the People's Liberation Army's manned and unmanned
teaming operations. Were China to infuse its cruise missiles and
hypersonic glide capabilities with AI and autonomy, close-range
encounters in the Taiwan Straits and the East and South China Seas would
become more **[complicated, accident-prone, and
destabilizing]{.underline}**---**[at both a conventional and nuclear
level.]{.underline}**75 China is reportedly developing and deploying
UUVs to bolster its underwater monitoring and antisubmarine capabilities
as part of a broader goal to establish an "underwater Great Wall" to
challenge US undersea military primacy. **[US AI enhanced UUVs
could]{.underline}**, for example, theoretically **[threaten both
China's nuclear ballistic and nonnuclear attack
submarines]{.underline}**.76 The **[deployment of new military
technology in the nuclear domain]{.underline}**, therefore,
**[affects]{.underline}** states differently depending on the relative
strength of their strategic force **[AI Strategic
Stability]{.underline}** **[structure]{.underline}**. Thus, **[even if
US UUVs were programmed only to threaten China's nonnuclear attack
fleets]{.underline}**, **[Chinese commanders might nonetheless fear that
their country's nascent and relatively small---compared to
US]{.underline}** and Russian **[SSBN
fleets]{.underline}**---**[sea-based nuclear deterrent could be
neutralized more easily]{.underline}**.77 Moreover, advances in
**[machine learning sensor technology]{.underline}** for enabling more
accurate detection **[of Chinese SSBNs]{.underline}** **[would likely
reinforce Beijing's concerns that it was being targeted by a militarily
superior power]{.underline}**--- especially the United States. To test
the veracity of this scenario, a better understanding of Chinese
**[thinking on]{.underline}** the utility of its
**[nuclear]{.underline}** and nonnuclear
**[capabilities]{.underline}**---and how it **[could inform China's
attitude to escalation risk]{.underline}**---would be required

**[In a scenario in which Chinese forces believed one of their SSBNs was
threatened]{.underline}**, **[they would face only two realistic
options]{.underline}**: either **[leaving the foreign UUV or USV
alone---potentially putting the SSBN at risk]{.underline}**---**[or
using physical force to disrupt the unmanned foreign system's
operations]{.underline}**, whether by capturing it or by attempting to
destroy it. **[In such a case, it would be very difficult for China to

**[Washington]{.underline}**, in turn, **[could interpret Chinese
interference]{.underline}** **[with a U.S. UUV or USV]{.underline}**
**[as a provocation or the use of force]{.underline}**, especially
during a crisis. Indeed, **[Beijing has recently signaled its
willingness to interfere with unmanned systems]{.underline}**. After the
December 2016 incident in which a PLA Navy ship seized a U.S. UUV in the
South China Sea, an article published through an account managed by the
overseas edition of the People's Daily argued that there is currently no
international law that regulates the maritime activities of unmanned
systems. This line of reasoning states that, unlike manned vessels,
unmanned systems do not enjoy a right to freedom of navigation and,
therefore, "in this grey area, as long as the United States dares to
send its underwater drones \[to China's coastal waters\], China
certainly has the right to seize them."22

### Nuclear Deterrence Link

#### AUVs and UUVs actively complicate and undermine deterrence

Sylvia **Mishra 19**, Sylvia Mishra is a New Tech Nuclear Officer at the

of Defence Studies, King's College London , 5/8/19, "Could unmanned

**[Nuclear [deterrence rests on]{.mark} the [ability]{.mark} of
strategic assets [to survive]{.mark} an enemy's [first
strike]{.mark}]{.underline}** and to retaliate, ensuring mutually
assured destruction.

**[Nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines ([SSBNs]{.mark}) are
[considered to be the most survivable of all]{.mark} nuclear platforms
due to their stealth capabilities]{.underline}**, mobility and
discretion. Placing nuclear assets underwater puts them at a safer
distance from a crippling first strike**[. But [as technology
improves]{.mark} and the ocean [battlefield becomes more
complex]{.mark}, these advances could undermine the survivability of
strategic forces]{.underline}** around the world and make them far more
vulnerable.

**[Emerging technologies like unmanned underwater vehicles ([UUVs) add
to the complexity of the]{.mark} [battle space]{.mark} and [disrupt the
s]{.mark}tatus [quo]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Swarms of autonomous
underwater drones could be deployed to hunt ballistic-missile
submarines, targeting a cornerstone of nuclear deterrence.

In their
2017 [article](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/new-era-counterforce-technological-change-and-future-nuclear-deterrence) 'The
new era of counterforce', Keir A. Lieber and Daryl Press argue that for
most of the nuclear age, the survivability of retaliatory forces seemed
straightforward. However, **[improvements in counterforce technology
have eroded this cornerstone of nuclear deterrence. As new technology
continues to raise the potential for major shifts in the military realm,
the rapid advent of these drones may reduce the credibility and
effectiveness of SSBNs.]{.underline}**

**[UUVs can function without the direction of a human
operator]{.underline}** and have wide [dual-use (that is, civilian and
military)
applications](https://www.simulyze.com/blog/from-land-to-sea-5-ways-drones-are-impacting-underwater-operations).
Some are used for commercial purposes, hydrography and oceanographic
research. Lockheed Martin's yellow Marlin drone
submarine [inspects](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lockheed-marlin/weapons-maker-lockheed-builds-submarine-for-oil-rigs-idUSBRE87300D20120804) offshore
rigs and underwater pipelines, a task that's worth around a billion
dollars a year in the Gulf of Mexico.

**[But [UUV]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nologies have been [evolving]{.mark}
from defensive [to more offensive roles]{.mark}. UUVs
[increasing]{.mark}ly play a [critical [role]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
antisubmarine
warfare](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2014/0716/Military-ramps-up-use-of-underwater-drones.-What-do-they-do) ([ASW]{.mark})
and perform missions such as placing and monitoring sensors on the sea
floor to track enemy submarines.]{.underline}** **[They can gather
intelligence on opponents, detect and neutralise mines, hunt submarines
and chart the ocean floor. They could, potentially, detonate
warheads.]{.underline}** And they could take part in a coordinated
attack on an enemy submarine in conjunction with 'friendly' submarines
and surface vessels.

**[The United States, Russia and China are investing in this technology
to bolster their ASW capability and it's evident that UUVs will be
deployed in the near future]{.underline}** in combat operations.

**[The US Navy released a [UUV
masterplan](https://www.navy.mil/navydata/technology/uuvmp.pdf) in 2004
that set out nine priority areas for future UUV
capabilities.]{.underline}** In 2015, Brigadier General Frank Kelly
became the [first deputy assistant secretary of the US Navy for unmanned
systems](https://news.usni.org/2015/10/27/retired-brig-gen-frank-kelley-named-first-ever-deputy-assistant-secretary-of-the-navy-for-unmanned-systems).
In 2016, the Department of Defense [reportedly
spent](http://www.kemplon.com/how-submarine-drones-are-changing-the-naval-modus-operandi/) US\$232.9
million on procuring UUVs (US\$86.7 million more than in 2015). In 2018,
the US Office of Naval Research [awarded
Raytheon](https://navaltoday.com/2018/06/28/raytheon-wins-contract-for-locus-inp/) a
US\$29.7 million contract for developing a naval prototype of a
'low-cost UAV swarming technology', or LOCUST, system that can overwhelm
an adversary.

**[Russia and China aren't far behind.
Several [reports](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/navy-ships/a22593766/russia-working-on-new-cephalopod-underwater-attack-drone/) indicate
that Russia has been working on a 'killer underwater drone' since
2015]{.underline}**. The 'Cephalopod' is designed for the underwater
battlefield. Undersea warfare expert H.I.
Sutton [says](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/navy-ships/a22593766/russia-working-on-new-cephalopod-underwater-attack-drone/) that
it can target shipping but its torpedoes are intended to destroy
submarines. In a March 2018 speech to the Federal Assembly of the
Russian Federation, President Vladimir
Putin [highlighted](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43239331) Russian
military development of an underwater drone aimed at transforming
underwater warfare. **[A RAND
Corporation [report](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR990.html), Emerging
trends in China's development of unmanned systems, said Beijing had been
funding 15 different universities for research programs for
UUVs.]{.underline}**
Reports [indicate](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2156361/china-developing-unmanned-ai-submarines-launch-new-era-sea-power) that China
is also developing low-cost unmanned UUVs for a variety of military
applications, including 'suicide' attacks on enemy vessels.

**[These trends indicate that the proliferation of UUVs will have an
impact on the stability of the undersea warfighting domain. Emerging
capabilities suggest that the sea-based leg of the triad of missile
submarines,]{.underline}** land-based intercontinental ballistic
missiles and crewed bombers will increasingly become vulnerable.

**[However, some [experts argue that underwater drone tech]{.mark}nology
[is still in a nascent stage of development]{.mark} and faces challenges
in autonomous operations and communication]{.underline}**. The density
of seawater makes it difficult for UUVs to complete complex tasks that
require real-time decision-making. Former Chief of US Naval Operations
Admiral Jonathan
Greenert [noted](https://www.wsj.com/articles/underwater-drones-join-microphones-to-listen-for-chinese-nuclear-submarines-1414166607) that
one of the biggest obstacles for underwater drones is that they run on
batteries that last only a few hours and communication is difficult
because data passes very slowly through water.

**[It will take time for underwater drone technology to mature and pose
a serious threat to well-hidden SSBNs, but when drones swarm in packs,
it will become harder for submarines to escape detection. [Advances in
UUV tech]{.mark}nology will [undermine the stability of
deterrence]{.mark} and usher in a new underwater arms race that will
increase the risks of escalation in a crisis.]{.underline}**

As countries expand their underwater drone inventories, managing and
controlling them could become challenging. It's vital that operating
nations develop a global code of conduct for their use.

### 2NC \-\-- China not revisionist

#### China's a purely [defensive nuclear power]{.underline}\-\--empirical record [overwhelmingly]{.underline} goes affirmative.

(Major General Pan Zhenqiang (retired) is deputy chairman of the China
Foundation for International Studies, senior adviser to the China Reform
Forum and director of research at the Institute for Strategy and
Management of the Central University of Finance and Economics in China.
He is also a member of the Executive Committee of the Council of Pugwash
Conferences on Science and World Affairs., \"A Study of China's
No-First-Use Policy on Nuclear Weapons,\" Journal For Peace And Nuclear
Disarmament Volume 1, 2018 - Issue 1)

**[How should one understand China's no-first-use nuclear
policy?]{.underline}** In its very first official statement on the
no-first-use nuclear policy, the Chinese government purposefully chose
powerful expressions, such as "at any time" and "under any
circumstances," to stress that this pledge is absolute, unconditional,
and crystal clear. This fact has four implications.
**[First]{.underline}**, **[the unconditional]{.underline}**
**[n]{.underline}**o[-**f**]{.underline}irst**[-u]{.underline}**se
policy **[means that in China's security calculation, nuclear weapons
play only one role: to deter other states from attacking China with
nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. Simply put, **[if you do not use or
threaten to use nuclear weapons against China, then China's nuclear
arsenal is no threat to you]{.underline}**. **[If you choose
to]{.underline}** **[launch nuclear attacks on China, you must
anticipate nuclear retaliation,]{.underline}** most likely **[in the
form of counterattacks on several large cities]{.underline}** that would
demonstrate the "unbearable and disastrous consequences" that accompany
the use of nuclear weapons. Following this logic, China hopes to achieve
its objective of deterring any state from resorting to the nuclear
option against China. In short, **[China's]{.underline}**
**[n]{.underline}o[f]{.underline}**irst**[u]{.underline}**se commitment
**[reflects the purely defensive nature of its nuclear
policy]{.underline}**. In this respect, **[China's
strategy]{.underline}** that is aimed at deterring a nuclear attack
differs fundamentally from the deterrence strategy pursued by the
Western nuclear community. It **[aims strictly to prevent a nuclear
war]{.underline}**, **[whereas]{.underline}** the deterrence strategy
long maintained by **[other nuclear powers, particularly
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and
the USSR (now Russia), **[is based on preparing to win a nuclear war and
is offensive in nature]{.underline}**. This offensive strategy caused
the US and the USSR to enter into a near-crazy nuclear arms race,
escalating to a total of more than 70,000 warheads at the peak of the
Cold War, far beyond any rational defensive needs. The US nuclear
strategy has another striking feature: it is also applicable to non-
nuclear-weapon states. Particularly with respect to those states
considered unfriendly or disobedient, the US presents its nuclear
weapons as a principal means of military threat and political blackmail,
using its nuclear strategy as a powerful pillar to dominate the world.
**[Intent on disassociating itself from Western deterrence theory, the
Chinese government has little interest in going along with those Western
defense analysts]{.underline}** (as well as some nuclear theorists in
China itself) **[who try to observe China's nuclear strategy through the
lens of the Western deterrence concept and who describe China's nuclear
doctrine with such labels as "limited deterrence" or "minimum
deterrence"]{.underline}** (Xu 1987, 366--369; Chen 1989, 214; Yang
1990, 407--411).3 China believes that these are specious interpretations
that blur the clearly self-defensive nature of its nuclear strategy.
**[Second, its unconditional]{.underline}**
**[n]{.underline}**o**[f]{.underline}**irst**[u]{.underline}**se policy
**[implies that China has no need to engage in an arms race with other
nuclear weapon states]{.underline}**. **[No doubt,]{.underline}**
**[China must maintain a survivable nuclear force]{.underline}** that
can withstand the first wave of nuclear attacks with sufficient
counterattack capability. However, China believes it is much more
practical and sensible to keep its nuclear weapon development at that
level than to pursue a strategy like that of the US and the USSR
(Russia), which led inevitably to a nuclear arms race during the Cold
War. Throughout those decades of rivalry, the two nuclear superpowers
had to stand ready to strike first, thereby plunging themselves into a
paranoid mindset. They never knew how much nuclear strike capability was
sufficient, and they constantly worried about being overtaken by the
other country. Each side, never sure when the other might launch the
first bomb, remained constantly at the highest possible "launch on
warning" alert; each exaggerating the other's nuclear capabilities and
proceeding with its own nuclear armament and readiness planning based on
the worst-case scenario. **[From China's perspective, a strategy
containing these elements is the root cause of the escalating risk of a
nuclear war]{.underline}**. **[China has never been bothered by such
over-anxiety or over-action in its nuclear thinking]{.underline}**.
**[China believes that to prevent a nuclear war from happening, it is
sufficient to target just a few big cities for
retaliation]{.underline}**; thus [it **is not necessary to build a huge
arsenal or develop massive offensive capabilities**]{.underline}.
**[Since acquiring its own nuclear capability]{.underline}** in 1964,
**[China has conducted the least number of nuclear tests among the
five]{.underline}** Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty
(**[NPT]{.underline}**) **[nuclear weapon states, and it has maintained
only a minimum number of warheads]{.underline}** throughout that time.
**[Also]{.underline}** notably, **[China sees no need to develop
non-strategic nuclear weapons, such as]{.underline}**
**[t]{.underline}**actical **[n]{.underline}**uclear
**[w]{.underline}**eapons, which in China's view are primarily for use
on the battlefield; **[to develop]{.underline}** so-called **[precision-
strike nuclear war-fighting capabilities; or to deploy nuclear weapons
on the soil of other countries]{.underline}**. **[Furthermore, China
considers it unnecessary to keep its nuclear forces at the
launch-on-warning alert level]{.underline}**, because it is prepared
only to mount counter- attacks if attacked. **[Before any counterattack
takes place, China must first determine whether the
attack]{.underline}** against China **[is]{.underline}** of a
**[nuclear]{.underline}** nature **[and who the attacker
is]{.underline}**. Such investigation and verification will be
time-consuming. In fact, **[China]{.underline}** generally **[keeps its
warheads away from]{.underline}** intercontinental ballistic missile
(**[ICBM]{.underline}**) **[launchers]{.underline}**, installing them
only when launching becomes necessary. **[This]{.underline}** approach
not only **[improves]{.underline}** the **[survivability]{.underline}**
of its nuclear force **[but also,]{.underline}** more importantly,
**[tells the world that China's nuclear posture is never
offensive]{.underline}**. **[All these are logical effects of
the]{.underline}**
**[n]{.underline}**o**[f]{.underline}**irs**t[u]{.underline}**se policy,
**[which indeed determines China's nuclear posture]{.underline}**,
including the mission, size, and structure of its nuclear weapons, as
well as the doctrine governing them. For this reason, **[the common
depiction of China's]{.underline}**
**[n]{.underline}**o**[f]{.underline}**irst**[u]{.underline}**se policy
**[as unverifiable rhetoric is demonstrably groundless]{.underline}**.
Currently, along with its technological and political development,
**[China]{.underline}**, like other nuclear weapon states, **[is also
modernizing its array of nuclear armaments, particularly by enhancing
the surety, reliability, and effectiveness of its ballistic
missiles]{.underline}**. **[This includes]{.underline}**, among others,
**[building a nuclear triangle focusing on land- launching ICBMs
complemented by bombers and submarines]{.underline}**. **[China is also
strengthening its capacity for rapid reaction, effective penetration,
conventional precision strikes, damage infliction, and its own
protection and survivability]{.underline}**. All these actions are
geared toward effectively handling future war threats and emergencies.
And all these steps, as pointed out by China's Defense White Paper, have
been taken in line with the country's pledge never to be the first to
resort to nuclear weapons (Information Office of the State Council
(China) 2013, 12). In short, the no-first-use policy keeps China out of
an arms race with other states, and this healthy mindset allows China to
proceed with its nuclear modernization programs at a more measured and
unruffled pace, in conformity with its national defense needs and within
the limits of its overall national strength. Third, the unconditional
no-first-use policy also means that nuclear development is not
considered a way of compensating for any shortage of conventional
capabilities in China's overall military planning. This is another
important factor distinguishing China's nuclear strategy from that of
other nuclear powers. In the eyes of other nuclear powers, nuclear
weapons, other than being more powerfully destructive, are not
qualitatively different from conventional weapons; both are ready and
available for use in the battlefield. In the early years of the Cold
War, when the US enjoyed first a nuclear monopoly and later nuclear
superiority over the USSR but lagged behind in terms of conventional
forces, it waved nuclear bombers as a trump card in its massive
retaliation plan. In those years, Washington planned that if war should
erupt with the USSR, it would immediately use nuclear weapons to crush
the enemy. But soon, the Soviets caught up with the US nuclear
capability while maintaining a superior conventional posture relative to
NATO's deployment in Europe. By this time, the latter alliance was
forced to abandon the idea of winning the war through massive nuclear
attacks. But the US and NATO were still prepared to use nuclear weapons
first as an effective firewall to stop an offensive by Warsaw Pact
conventional forces. With the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the
Warsaw Pact, the confrontation persisted between the two factions, with
the US and the NATO on one side, and Russia, which retained the legacy
of the Soviet era, on the other side. But the two sides now seem to have
swapped positions, with Russia on the weak side, particularly with
regard to conventional weapons. It is, thus, now Russia's turn to follow
the same path that the Western bloc had adopted during the Cold War era,
offsetting its conventional inferiority with its nuclear arsenal. Soon
after the end of the Cold War, in November 1993, Russia announced that
it was abandoning its pledge not to use nuclear weapons first,
emphasizing that in a future major military conflict with the West, it
would launch a first strike if deemed necessary -- although many believe
that the USSR was never serious about its no-first-use pledge during the
Cold War. Britain and France, the two next-tier nuclear states, also
cling to the position of willingness to use nuclear weapons first, even
though as members of NATO they are already under the US nuclear umbrella
at least theoretically. Their calculation seems to be that, if they were
to give up this position, their status as global powers would be
substantially undermined and their status within NATO greatly impaired.
Another consideration behind these countries' threat to use nuclear
weapons first is the desire to maintain their traditional interests in
specific regions of the world, such as the Middle East and Africa.4
**[China has taken an approach fundamentally different from the other
NPT nuclear weapon states.]{.underline}** **[Its]{.underline}**
**[n]{.underline}**o**[-f]{.underline}**irst**[-u]{.underline}**se
pledge **[demonstrates that China does not plan to offset its relatively
weak conventional strength]{.underline}** (vis-à-vis the US, for
example) **[with its nuclear capabilities, nor would it consider
resorting to nuclear weapons first in a conventional
conflict]{.underline}**. **[There are at least two reasons for
this]{.underline}** approach. **[One]{.underline}** reason **[is that
China deeply understands the huge, devastating consequences of the use
of nuclear weapons]{.underline}**, including the massive and inhumane
damage that would be perpetrated on both sides, and especially on
innocent people. **[Furthermore, China believes that a disconnection
between nuclear and conventional forces may be in China's best
interests]{.underline}**. **[The]{.underline}**
[n]{.underline}o[f]{.underline}irst- [u]{.underline}se policy **[was
formulated by the first-generation leaders of the newly founded republic
in 1949; all these leaders had experienced long revolutionary wars and
had little taste for engaging in another large-scale conventional war.
In their vision of a next war involving China, there was no role for
China as an invader; rather, China would be the invaded
country]{.underline}**, meaning that the war would be on China's soil.
Such a war was quite familiar to leaders like Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai.
They were confident that under the Communist Party's leadership, and
with its disciplined military force supported by the people, **[China
could fight a prolonged people's war, using inferior weapons to vanquish
its technically superior enemies, who would eventually drown in "the sea
of people's war]{.underline}**" (Sun 2006). This strategic thinking,
passed down from the forefathers, continues to be deeply imprinted in
the minds of their successors and serves as important guidance shaping
the no-first-use policy regarding nuclear weapons. **[Finally, the
unconditional]{.underline}**
[n]{.underline}**o**[-f]{.underline}irst[-u]{.underline}se policy
**[indicates that China does not intend to employ nuclear weapons as a
foreign-policy tool to advance its national interests]{.underline}**.
**[This]{.underline}** view **[arises from China's socialist system,
which has consistently supported a non-allied, independent foreign
policy of peaceful coexistence]{.underline}**. In sharp contrast, the US
acted in exactly the opposite way. By providing "extended nuclear
deterrence" to its allies, the US sought from the onset to control these
countries and prevent them from developing indigenous nuclear weapons,
keeping them dependent on a global security system dominated by
Washington. Such arrangements may have worked for some time, but whether
they could work permanently is a big question. Many of these allies have
never become fully reconciled to putting their fate in US hands and have
desired to break away from the US control from time to time, giving rise
to complicated frictions in the alliances. **[China]{.underline}** has
no such problems. It **[stands firm, not forming a military alliance
with any other state nor using nuclear weapons as a means to control or
influence another state's policy]{.underline}**. **[This position is
consistent with its]{.underline}**
[n]{.underline}o[-f]{.underline}irst[-u]{.underline}**se** pledge.

#### Stability and confidence in second strike ensures MAD and deterrence \-\-- the aff's perception change is the ONLY chance for a U.S.-China War

New American Security, and Abraham M. Denmark, United States Deputy

Weapons and U.S.-China Relations: A Way Forward",

To gain the benefits of strategic stability, the Working Group believes
**[that nuclear relations between the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates and **[China should emphasize
two]{.underline}** complementary **[approaches: crisis stability and
arms race stability. Crisis stability emphasizes the need to minimize
pressure on either side to be the first to use nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** based on perceived advantage or vulnerability. It
thus emphasizes the need for a strategic dynamic in which **[both sides
see that launching their nuclear weapons first to avoid being disarmed
or to try to disarm one's opponent is unnecessary and
unwise.]{.underline}** **[Arms race stability focuses on the longer term
and emphasizes controlling the dynamics of arms competition that can
affect the strategic balance, and specifically calculations associated
with first-strike stability]{.underline}**. The Working Group believes
**[these concepts can even be highly useful in relations between two
countries that have asymmetric capabilities such as the United States
and China. Such concepts do not demand that two nations have the
same]{.underline}** or similar numbers or **[types of
forces]{.underline}**. Rather, they are adaptable goals that can be
fitted to the situation that exists between the United States and China.
Based on this concept, **[stability can emerge between the United States
and China if they each field forces that are capable of surviving a
first strike and if they are able to credibly demonstrate to the other
side that their current and future capabilities are unable to deny the
other side a viable strategic deterrent]{.underline}**. As a result,
**[fear of preemption and the need to launch weapons early become
irrelevant]{.underline}**, either as irritants in crisis or as dangers
in conflict. In this way, **[the benefits of deterrence can be retained
while minimizing the chances of nuclear escalation]{.underline}**. The
premise of arms control and stability-oriented measures is that even
potential adversaries can achieve the twin goals of both effective
nuclear deterrence and mitigation of the possibility of conflict between
them. This is because nuclear forces themselves can intensify, if not
cause, competition and even conflict---but they need not. **[Nuclear
deterrence is not simply a unilateral action that takes places in a
vacuum; rather, it is a relationship shaped by
perceptions]{.underline}**. Indeed, the ways in which a country
procures, postures, and operates its nuclear forces have a major
interactive effect on how other countries procure, posture, and operate
their forces. Potential **[adversaries can]{.underline}** allay, and
possibly even **[remove]{.underline}**, these **[exacerbating factors
through unilateral and cooperative measures that effectively demonstrate
that each side's strategic forces are not capable of conducting a
disarming first strike. Such measures do not solve more fundamental
political and strategic disputes, but they can help to lessen tensions
and mistrust stemming from]{.underline}** the essentially ancillary
technical features of **[interstate relations. Both sides could derive
value from cooperation on nuclear weapons grounded in the stability
concept. The United States worries about the composition of China's
nuclear force, Chinese views on escalation and plans for nuclear use,
and the future trajectory of China's strategic posture]{.underline}**.
Meanwhile, **[China worries that the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[may be able or seek to be able to deny it a
second-strike capability, and it worries about]{.underline}** the scope
and sophistication of future U.S. programs, as well as **[U.S.
unwillingness to acknowledge a condition of mutual vulnerability between
the two nations. A stability-grounded model could help address these
anxieties---on the U.S. side by providing greater insight into China's
current and future force structure and deeper insight into China's ways
of thinking about nuclear strategy, and on the Chinese side by providing
similar insight into U.S. developments and a greater degree of assurance
about U.S. acknowledgment of the survivability of China's
force]{.underline}**. Concurrently, **[such an approach would have the
added benefit of building confidence on both sides]{.underline}**.
Finally, such a model could provide a satisfactory method through which
China could see something approximating its current force size, posture,
and doctrine as satisfactory and compatible with stability.

### Impacts \-\-- LOW = Acc War

#### Chinese Launch on Warning causes accidental nuclear conflict

David **Santoro 19**, PhD, Director and Senior Fellow for Nuclear
Policy, Pacific Forum International, 6/20/19, Testimony before the
U.S.-China Economic Security Review Commission,
https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Santoro_USCC%20Testimony_FINAL.pdf

Furthermore, Washington has been worried that China's evolving nuclear
capabilities will present Beijing with new, problematic strategic
options and create significant command, control, and communication (C3)
issues. For starters, **[[the Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline}**
modernization program could lead Beijing to change its stance on nuclear
counterattack: it **[[could adopt]{.mark} a
[launch-on-warning]{.mark}]{.underline}** (LOW)
**[[posture]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[abandoning its traditional stance
to retaliate only after it has absorbed a nuclear strike]{.underline}**.
The improved mobility, readiness, and informatization of SAF assets and
the PLA's space-based early-warning system have increasingly made
adoption of such a posture possible. The emerging nuclear roles of the
PLAN and PLAAF will make it even easier because nuclear warheads have to
be mated with delivery systems on sea and air platforms. Is an LOW
posture compatible with an NFU policy, especially given that Beijing has
often pointed to its de-mated posture as evidence that it abides by NFU
principles? Another area of possible change concerns Chinese thinking
about adopting a limited nuclear warfighting posture as a result of the
increasing commingling and co-location of its nuclear and conventional
assets, the diversification of its nuclear forces (notably its emerging
nuclear triad), and its work to enhance "integrated strategic
deterrence." 21 Could these developments lead Beijing to endorse
warfighting as an option for its nuclear forces? The consequences of
Chinese modernization for C3 have also been worrisome to Washington.
While the SAF was tasked to pursue "dual deterrence and dual
operations," i.e., wield both nuclear-and conventional-capable missiles,
as early as in the mid-1980s, the modernization, diversification, and
expansion of China's conventional force has, as mentioned earlier, only
begun to grow fast in recent years. Looking ahead, it is likely that the
continued introduction of new dual-capable missiles, the increasing
dispersal of land-mobile missiles, and the steady rise in the number of
deployable nuclear weapons will, at the very least, complicate the C3
systems of China's land-based nuclear delivery systems. What's more, the
emerging nuclear roles of the PLAN and PLAAF will add extra and probably
major layers of complexity. The concern is that **[a [human error or
malfunction]{.mark} could increase instability or [lead to inadvertent
escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Many questions remain unanswered:
Will C3 systems be modernized in a timely fashion, as nuclear
modernization proceeds? Will the SAF be involved in PLAN and PLAAF
nuclear missions? Will the PLAN and PLAAF develop nuclear-warhead
management know-how and capability of their own? How do Beijing and the
PLA intend to communicate with PLAN assets? Will they introduce
pre-delegated authority to launch nuclear weapons?

### No Russia War

#### No Russia war---Ukraine has recked them 

**Bergman 5/22**- director of the Europe Program at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.,(Max Bergmann,
"Russia's Coming Great Power Struggle," CSIS, May 12, 2022,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-coming-great-power-struggle)//mcu

On Monday, all eyes were on Red Square for the annual May 9 victory day
celebration to see what Vladimir Putin would do. The answer was not
much. Instead of mobilizing the country for total war against Ukraine or
declaring some sort of Potemkin victory, Putin stayed the course. This
is not because the current trajectory of Russia's operation in Ukraine
is working as planned. [What has become apparent in the war in
Ukraine]{.underline}, especially since Russia gave up its offensive
against Kyiv, [is that [there is a gap between Russia's]{.mark}
grandiose geopolitical [objectives and]{.mark} its [capacity]{.mark} to
deliver.]{.underline} In the case of Ukraine, escalating the conflict
might turn the war in Putin's favor, but mass mobilization would not
guarantee success in the battlefield. It could also lead to intense
public backlash, putting his regime at risk. Thus, the two defining
obsessions of the Putin era---regime survival and Russia's geopolitical
might---are in tension. As sanctions take their toll and battlefield
losses mount, the gap between Putin's ambitions and Russia's capacity is
likely to grow. As a leader obsessed with geopolitics, Putin will
inevitably engage in a desperate scramble to maintain Russia's great
power status, but he will find it incredibly difficult in the weeks,
months, and years ahead to do so. The basic problem for Putin is that
[[Western strategy to weaken Russia is working better than]{.mark}
anyone could have [expected]{.mark}]{.underline}. Secretary of Defense
Lloyd Austin's comment may have overstepped when he bluntly said, "We
want to see Russia weakened." But underlying Austin's comments is a
clear sense of confidence that the strategy is clearly working. The
initial thrust of this strategy began on the economic front with
sanctions. The original assumption behind sanctions was not that they
would get Putin to end the war. Banks do not stop tanks, after all. But
instead, [by imposing significant medium- to long-term costs on Russia,
such that in the next 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years, the Russian economy
would be severely weakened, the Kremlin would be forced into a tough
juggling act between]{.underline} guns ([geopolitical
ambition]{.underline}) [or]{.underline} butter ([domestic
tranquility]{.underline}). What has surprised U.S. policymakers is the
speed and intensity through which the U.S. and European public have
demanded stronger actions. European outrage has led to a far stronger
sanctions response than imagined possible before the war[.
[Europe]{.mark} has demonstrated it is willing to bear substantial
economic costs to [weaken Russia]{.mark} and is now moving at an
incredible pace to decouple from Russia]{.underline}, now targeting
Russian oil. [This is]{.underline} having a
[[devastating]{.underline}]{.mark} impact on [[Russia's
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Russian Central Bank survey reveals
expectations of soaring inflation, economic contraction, and no growth.
Furthermore, [Russia is facing a massive brain drain as up to 200,000
Russians may have left the country by the second week of March
alone]{.underline}. It has also suffered substantial damage to its
burgeoning tech industry, as it lost access to some overseas markets and
may lose up to 170,000 tech workers. The biggest surprise, however, is
the performance of Ukraine on the battlefield, [the ineptitude of
Russia's military, and the game-changing efficacy Western security
assistance]{.underline}. [[Russia's forces have suffered shocking
losses]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [Pentagon estimates that Russia has
lost around 25 percent of the combat power it had used to invade
Ukraine]{.underline}, with the UK defense minister claiming that Russia
suffered losses of 15,000 in personnel and over 2,500 in large
equipment. If the war ended tomorrow, Russia would have considerable
costs to recapitalize its forces---build more tanks and Kalibr cruise
missile systems, as well as train new personnel---not to mention seek to
address the deficiencies exposed in the war. But the war is not going to
end tomorrow, [and the long-term costs to Russia will grow]{.underline}.
Thus, Russia finds itself in a huge hole. But [to make
matters]{.underline} much [worse]{.underline} for the Kremlin, [the
[export controls]{.mark}]{.underline}---one of the most innovative
aspects of the sanctions---[[is just starting]{.mark} to
bite.]{.underline} The export controls are [designed to restrict
commercial exports to Russia of advanced technology]{.underline}. This
raises major questions for the Kremlin. For instance, [[how will Russia
be able to rebuild its military when it cannot buy
semiconductors]{.mark} to build new Kalibr cruise missiles? When a
Western component used to manufacture Russian tanks breaks, will Russia
be able to get another? If not, can it build its own?]{.underline}
According to the White House, two major plants that specialize in
manufacturing and repair of tanks---Uralvagonzavod Corporation and the
Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant---have suspended their work due to the lack of
foreign components. There is no doubt that [[Russia]{.underline}
[will]{.underline}]{.mark} [aggressively [pursue
work-arounds]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sanctions evasion will be a nonstop
pursuit, aided by China, as well as other complicit countries. Russia
will use "burner banks" that pop up to handle a transaction, get
sanctioned, and go away. It will use shell companies, smugglers, and the
criminal underworld to gain access to materials. It will, in short, act
like North Korea. But while this type of smuggling can support a bespoke
missile development operation, it is highly uncertain whether this will
suffice to keep the Russian defense industrial sector humming.
Nevertheless, [[even if]{.mark} Russia finds a way, [acquiring items
through the black market]{.mark} and through convoluted means will
[add]{.mark} substantial [costs]{.mark}, **[further depleting]{.mark}
Russia's [economic coffers]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Russia will seek to
turn to domestic production, pursuing classic import substitution,
hoping domestic production will replace imported goods. This could work
in some areas, but items like semiconductors cannot just be conjured out
of thin air, especially when Russia's knowledge workers have fled in
droves[. Even if Russia can replace imported parts domestically, this
will still add costs and is unlikely to result in the same level of
quality of imported goods]{.underline}. [Whether [export
controls]{.mark} succeed in [starv]{.mark}ing [Russia]{.mark} [of the
techn]{.mark}ology and machinery necessary to rebuild its military is of
**immense geopolitical importance.**]{.underline} Russia's defense
industrial prowess is key to its foreign policy and undergirds its
relationships with countries across the globe. This is especially true
for a country like India. India is dependent on the Russian arms
industry and has \$8 billion worth of outstanding military orders from
Russia, and also needs a continuous supply of spare parts and
components. Indian officials said they expect some short-term delays in
the "S-400 Triumf missile systems, Grigorovich-class stealth frigates,
and Kalashnikov AK 203-7.62x39mm assault rifles, as well as spares
supplies for Kilo-class submarines, MiG-29 fighters, and Kamov Mi-17
military transport helicopters. . . . India today imports over 10,000
types of spares and line replacement units worth over \$500 million
annually from Russia." Will Russia be able to meet its deliveries? If
Russia can't deliver, India will have to scramble, increasingly turning
to U.S., European, and Asian partners for alternatives. But beyond
India, Russia's defense industrial troubles could severely impact its
foreign policy with countries around the world. In Southeast Asia,
Vietnam is reliant on Russia's defense industry and could be further
alienated by closer Sino-Russian relations. Furthermore, 50 percent of
Africa's defense industrial imports come from Russia. Thus, [if
sanctions and export restrictions work as expected, Putin will have to
scramble to maintain Russia's global standing]{.underline}. [[The most
direct way for Putin to assert Russia's strength]{.mark} and deter the
West]{.underline} from taking advantage of a militarily weakened Russia,
[[is nuclear saber rattling.]{.underline} **[This is already evident in
loose]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**[talk]{.mark}** from Russian officials,
leading to understandable concerns about risks of nuclear
escalation]{.underline}. [Reviving such concerns in the West could be a
boon to a Kremlin, as it might foster prestige-building Cold War-era
nuclear talks or help constrain Western belligerence.]{.underline}
Russia could also continue to look to asymmetric means to hit back and
impose costs on the West. [Cyberattacks, political influence and
disinformation campaigns, money laundering and corruption efforts are
few of the many tools in its toolbox]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, its [effectiveness has eroded somewhat, as Russia
has lost the element of surprise]{.underline}. The United States and
Europe have obsessively studied Russia's active measures campaigns since
2016. Russian disinformation campaigns on the war in Ukraine have had
little impact on the West. Instead, it is the United States, with its
aggressive disclosures of intelligence, and Ukraine, with Zelensky
filming cell phone videos and posting Ukrainian battlefield successes on
social media, that have been winning the information war. [Russian
political influencing efforts will also prove increasingly
difficult]{.underline}. Putin-friendly politicians, from Marine Le Pen
in France to Matteo Salvini in Italy, have sought to create their
distance. [[Russia can still attempt at the margins to impact
politics]{.mark}, corrupting politicians or secretly donating or funding
political campaigns]{.underline}. [[But U.S. and European intelligence
and law enforcement are focused on this threat]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Additionally, [the massive wealth and influence of Russian oligarchs,
which has had a corrosive impact on their democratic hosts, has been
aggressively uprooted]{.underline}. **[[Russia]{.mark} [has]{.mark} thus
[lost one of its most important soft power tools]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The end result is that [the West is both on guard and has built up a
degree of resilience. Cyberattacks against the West are
another]{.underline} potential [option]{.underline} for Putin. There are
significant concerns about the vulnerability of critical infrastructure
in the United States to Russian cyberattacks. But [[attacks on critical
infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as the May 2021 Colonial
Pipeline attack, allegedly by a nominally private Russian actors, also
[carry [greater risks for the Kremlin]{.mark}]{.underline} now. While
the Biden administration decided to prioritize summitry with Putin
rather than responding in kind, [a Russian cyberattack in this
environment would]{.underline} likely be treated far differently,
possibly [result]{.underline}ing [in a U.S. cyber response]{.underline}
against Russian infrastructure or expanding direct involvement in
Ukraine. [[A]{.mark} [vulnerable Russia, with its hands full in]{.mark}
eastern [Ukraine]{.mark}, [will likely be nervous about provoking an
escalatory spiral.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Checks solve Russia escalation

**Tsygankov 16**---Professor at the Departments of Political Science and
International Relations at San Francisco State University \[Andrei, "5
reasons why the threat of a global war involving Russia is overstated,"
*Russia Direct*, 19 Feb,
http://www.russia-direct.org/opinion/5-reasons-why-threat-great-power-war-involving-russia-overstated\]

First, **[whatever the rhetoric, major powers are not inclined towards
risky behavior when their core interests are at stake. This concerns not
only the nuclear superpowers, but also countries such as
Turkey]{.underline}**. The prospect of confronting Russia\'s
overwhelmingly superior military should give pause even to someone as
hot-tempered as Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. Even if Erdogan wanted
to pit Russia against NATO, it wouldn't work. So far, **[NATO has been
careful to not be drawn into highly provocative actions, whether it is
by responding to Russia seizing the Pristina]{.underline}**
International **[Airport]{.underline}** in June 1999, **[getting
involved on Georgia's side]{.underline}** during the military conflict
**[in]{.underline}** August **[2008 or by providing lethal military
assistance and support for Ukraine]{.underline}**. Unless Russia is the
clear and proven aggressor, NATO is unlikely to support Turkey and begin
World War III. Second, **[Russia remains a defensive power aware of its
responsibility for maintaining international stability. Moscow wants to
work with major powers]{.underline}**, not against them. Its insistence
on Western recognition of Russia's interests must not be construed as a
drive to destroy the foundations of the international order, such as
sovereignty, multilateralism, and arms control. Third, the United States
has important interests to prevent regional conflicts from escalating or
becoming trans-regional. Although its relative military capabilities are
not where they were ten years ago, **[the U.S. military and diplomatic
resources are sufficient to restrain key regional players in any part of
the world]{.underline}**. Given the power rivalry across several
regions, **[proxy wars are possible and]{.underline}** indeed **[are
happening, but they are unlikely to escalate]{.underline}**. Fourth,
unlike the Cold War era, **[the contemporary world has no rigid alliance
structure]{.underline}**. The so-called Russia-China-Iran axis is hardly
more than a figment of the imagination by American neoconservatives and
some Russia conspiracy-minded thinkers. **[The world remains a space in
which international coalitions overlap and are mostly formed on an ad
hoc basis]{.underline}**. Fifth, with the exception of the Islamic State
of Iraq and the Greater Syria (ISIS), **[there is no fundamental
conflict of values and ideologies. Despite the efforts to present as
incompatible the so-called "traditional" and "Western" values by Russia
or "democracy" to "autocracy" by the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and Europe, the world majority does not
think that this cultural divide is worth fighting for]{.underline}**.
Despite the dangers of **[the world]{.underline}** we live in, it
**[contains a number of important]{.underline}**, even underappreciated,
**[checks on great powers' militarism]{.underline}**. The **[threat talk
coming from politicians is often deceiving. Such talk may be a way to
pressure the opponent into various political and military concessions
rather than to signal real intentions. When such pressures do not bring
expected results, the rhetoric of war and isolation
subsides]{.underline}**. **[Then a dialogue begins]{.underline}**.
Perhaps, the increasing frequency of exchanges between Obama and Putin
since December 2015 - including their recent phone conversation
following the Munich conference - suggest a growing recognition that the
record of pressuring Russia has

Tanks are great for fighting other tanks, but **[there is little serious
likelihood of a full-scale land war between Russia and
NATO]{.underline}**. For everything else, from flag-flying and
humanitarian intervention, to heading off Crimea-style landgrabs, where
what matters is getting to the battlefield when it counts, rather than
too late, the special forces, Royal Marines and paras are hard to beat.
**[These forces also suit post-Brexit geopolitics]{.underline}**. They
allow the UK to achieve its usual aim of "punching above its weight"
and, blasphemy though it may be, make the French happy. On a recent trip
to the French defence ministry, I repeatedly heard concerns that Brexit
leaves France as the last EU country with the will and the forces to
mount serious out-of-area operations. If we are still potential
partners, that gives us credibility -- and leverage. In a way, the
**[Russians have a similar perspective on the Royal Navy]{.underline}**.
What bothers them is not our massive new aircraft carrier, which one
naval officer said would make a great "missile magnet" in time of war.
Rather, **[the concern is about smaller, lighter forces. Submarines that
can contest the northern waters. Frigates able to both protect our
coastlines and project power abroad. Simply having the number of ships
to keep enough deployed at any one time.]{.underline}** As the officer
continued: "If your navy is essentially one carrier battle group, you
can do one thing well, but nothing else." Thirdly, it is not just
specific forces and units that the Russians believe gives the UK its
edge, but training and morale. Russian **[successes in Crimea and Syria
partly represent an unfamiliar new emphasis on the human side of their
military]{.underline}**. Britain's problems of having to scrimp on
training and overstretch its forces have not gone unnoticed. One Russian
noted that "these days, the Europeans have armies but no soldiers, while
the British have always had soldiers" -- he actually used the word
boets, which really means something closer to "warriors" -- "so why
would they want to lose that?" Why indeed? Of course there are many
other facets essential to the UK's defence capability. What doesn't seem
to worry the Russians? Not once have I heard any taking our "independent
nuclear deterrent" seriously. For all kinds of reasons, this is
currently not under serious debate -- though taking its cost out of the
defence budget would make a massive difference -- but let us not pretend
it is because Moscow thinks it matters.

This does not imply that a declining Russia will be easier to handle, as
it might partly disintegrate and tempt the leadership to take irrational
decisions. Nevertheless, its overall power to pursue what it considers
Russian interests will profoundly decline.

**[All too often the Arctic region
is [portrayed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/newsbeat-45193481/could-the-arctic-be-where-the-next-cold-war-happens) as
an area [on the
cusp](https://theconversation.com/arctic-cold-war-climate-change-has-ignited-a-new-polar-power-struggle-107329) of [military
crisis](http://time.com/4773238/russia-cold-war-united-states-artic-donald-trump-barack-obama-vladimir-putin/)]{.underline}**.
This is an easy narrative to sell; **[it harks back to the Cold
War.]{.underline}** [Potent imagery
persists](https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/environment-and-conservation/2018/10/scenes-new-cold-war-unfolding-top-world) of
submarines trolling silently beneath the Arctic ice and nuclear
ballistic missiles pointed across the North Pole.

**[During the height of the standoff between NATO and the USSR, the
world feared a barrage of nuclear warheads streaming in from the frozen
north]{.underline}** -- and this experience has imprinted on the
collective imagination and created distinct ideas about the region.
**[This fear]{.underline}**, for example, **[motivated from the 1950s
the construction of the [Distant Early Warning (DEW)
Lines](https://www.ubcpress.ca/lock-stock-and-icebergs), a system of
radar stations across the northern US (Alaska), Canada, and Greenland.
The DEW Lines were meant to give the US and its NATO allies an early
warning of an incoming Soviet nuclear strike.]{.underline}**

The Cold War was a significant period in history. But **[catchy
headlines playing off the parallels between the region and a new "cold"
war are misleading. There have]{.underline}**, of course, **[been
increased tensions]{.underline}** between the West and Russia since 2014
due to the conflict over Ukraine and Crimea. The 2018 [Trident
Juncture](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_158620.htm) exercises
in the Arctic, featuring "50,000 personnel from NATO Allies and partner
countries", are evidence of this. But **[the tension is not
Arctic-specific and militaries are diverse actors in the region. This
nuance, however, is often overlooked.]{.underline}**

**[Current military exercises and equipment acquisitions fuel [old Cold
War
perceptions](https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/security/2018/11/first-division-new-missile-system-ready-arctic#.W_6ezBEvu8Y.twitter)]{.underline}**.
And a certain **[militarization is indeed occurring in the Arctic.
Russia]{.underline}**, for example, **[has recently invested heavily in
updating its northern [military
infrastructure](https://www.amazon.com/Russias-Arctic-Strategies-Future-North/dp/0765635011)]{.underline}**.
So too have other Arctic states, such
as [Canada](http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/business-equipment/arctic-offshore-patrol-ships.page) and [Denmark](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-denmark-china-greenland-base/denmark-spurned-chinese-offer-for-greenland-base-over-security-sources-idUSKBN1782EE).
But [military activity has, to varying degrees, occurred for decades in
the north -- it was just largely ignored by those not living there until
recently.]{.underline}

**[What's changed?]{.underline}**

**[The Arctic states guard their land and waterways]{.underline}**
through aerial, submarine and surface ship patrols, much as they have
done for years. **[This hardly constitutes an escalation of military
tensions, even if the infrastructure is being updated and, in some
cases, increased. Despite this, talk of a new Cold War [is heating
up](https://t.co/9rzEK9Z64e).]{.underline}**

**[A nation's armed forces often play a range of roles]{.underline}** --
beyond their traditional responsibilities in armed conflict. They are
useful for **[rapid response during disasters]{.underline}**, for
example, and provide a **[range of security roles that don't necessarily
mean an escalation to war]{.underline}**. They offer search and rescue
(**[SAR) services]{.underline}** and **[policing support]{.underline}**.

In **[Norway]{.underline}**, for example, the
**[coastguard]{.underline}** is one of the branches of the navy, along
with the armed fleet, the naval schools [and the naval
bases](https://forsvaret.no/en/organisation/navy). In
**[Denmark]{.underline}**, meanwhile, **[the coastguard's Arctic
activities are managed by the [Royal Danish
Navy](https://www2.forsvaret.dk/eng/organisation/navy/pages/navy.aspx).]{.underline}**

In **[Canada]{.underline}**, the **[coastguard is a civilian
organization]{.underline}**. It "is the principal civilian maritime
operational arm of the [government of
Canada](http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/eng/CCG/SAR_Maritime_Sar)". But it
**[also works closely with the Department of National
Defense]{.underline}** to provide Canada's [search and rescue
services](https://www.academia.edu/12797020/Symbolism_and_Militarism_of_Canada_s_North_Book_Chapter_),
including [aerial
support](http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/eng/CCG/SAR_Maritime_Sar).

The **[US coastguard is part of the [Department of Homeland
Security](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2017-02/shift-coast-guard-dod)]{.underline}**,
which "**[secures the nation's air, land, and sea borders to prevent
illegal activity while facilitating [lawful travel and
trade](https://www.dhs.gov/secure-and-manage-borders)]{.underline}**".
By law, however, the US coastguard is outside the Department of Defense
"in peacetime and is poised for transfer to the Department of the
Navy [during
war](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2017-02/shift-coast-guard-dod)".

**[Because of affiliations such as these]{.underline}**, the line
between military and civilian activity can become blurred. But that
doesn't mean all military activity is hostile or equates to an
escalation towards war.

**[Changing environment]{.underline}**

**[Climate change and technological advances have begun to open up the
Arctic]{.underline}**. And this means that **[more policing is required
in a region that is remote and often out of reach for traditional police
forces.]{.underline}**

**[Other issues are also arising from climate change]{.underline}**,
such as **[increased forest fires]{.underline}**. In July 2018, Sweden
suffered major forest fires. As part of its effort to combat the fires
it deployed ["**[laser-guided bombs to douse forest
fires]{.underline}**"](https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/military/sweden-deploys-laserguided-bombs-to-douse-forest-fires/news-story/1cf1fe478b64ffd118aafe5d1cdd56a0).
This initiative was **[led by the Swedish air force]{.underline}**. By
using laser bombs, the "shockwaves simply blew out the flames in the
same way our breath does to candles".

As the region's **[economic activity expands, armed forces are also
being asked to assist more with civilian issues]{.underline}**. In 2017,
for example, **[the Norwegian coastguard was called in by local police
in Tromsø to [help police Greenpeace
protesters](http://www.rcinet.ca/eye-on-the-arctic/2017/08/18/greenpeace-vessel-towed-protesters-arrested-norwegian-arctic-waters/)]{.underline}** who
had entered a 500-metre safety zone around the Songa Enabler rig in an
effort to stop drilling in the Korpfjell field of the Barents Sea.
**[The Norwegian coastguard vessel, KV Nordkapp, responded, resulting in
the seizure of Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise ship and the arrest of all 35
people on board.]{.underline}**

**[Given the Arctic's growing economic potential, military
infrastructure is getting [more
attention](https://geohistory.today/russia-arctic-development-power/)]{.underline}**.
**[Russia]{.underline}**, in particular, **[has made it clear that with
economic potential on the line in the Arctic, a [military buildup is
essential](https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/russias-arctic-military-and-security-part-two/)]{.underline}**.
For Russia, Arctic resources are central to the country's economic
security so the [government
line](https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/russias-arctic-military-and-security-part-two/) is:
"**[National security in the Arctic requires an advanced naval, air
force and army presence.]{.underline}**" But issues of national security
are wide ranging and are not solely a matter of building capacity to
defend oneself from or in war.

Overall, **[it is vital to remember that while militaries are tools of
war, they are not just tools of war]{.underline}**. They also
**[contribute to and provide a wide range of security
services]{.underline}**. This does not mean that increased military
spending and activities should not be viewed with a critical eye.
Indeed, they should. But **[discussing "a new Cold War" is
sensationalist]{.underline}**. It detracts from the broader roles that
militaries play throughout the Arctic and stokes the very tensions it
warns of.

## Arctic War Answers

### Turn\-\--Adventurism Bad 

#### Arctic adventurism is bad -- collapses Russian trust and causes force-on-force friction 

**Ritter 20** --- Scott, Former US Marine Corps intelligence officer. He
served in the Soviet Union as an inspector implementing the INF Treaty,
in General Schwarzkopf's staff during the Gulf War, and from 1991-1998
as a UN weapons inspector, 05-14-2020, \"US muscle-flexing threatens to
open Arctic front in new Cold War with Russia,\" RT International,
https://www.rt.com/op-ed/488679-arctic-military-russia-us/, accessed
7-1-2022 //THS---OLW

**[The US Navy is on the cusp of conducting confrontational freedom of
navigation operations in the Arctic that threaten Russian economic and
national security interests.]{.underline}**

The recent resumption by the US Navy of a[ Barents Sea
Patrol](https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2020/05/11/the-us-navy-returns-to-an-increasingly-militarized-arctic/) represents
**[muscle-flexing on the part of Washington and its NATO
allies]{.underline}** unseen since the end of the Cold War. 

Three American destroyers and a British frigate, accompanied by a supply
ship, ventured into the Arctic body of water last week. The
**[reestablishment of the patrol is part of a larger refocusing of
attention by the US and NATO on the Arctic, where warming waters and
melting ice have created the possibility of faster sea transits between
Europe and Asia and access to natural resources which were previously
viewed as cost-prohibitive due to heavy ice conditions.]{.underline}** 

**[Russia, which views most of the Barents Sea as part of its
territorial waters, has made it clear to the US and the international
community that it will protect its core national economic and security
interests using all means available.]{.underline}** Given the stakes
involved, **[the potential for conflict is real should the US seek to
expand its military posture more aggressively in the
Arctic.]{.underline}**

This is precisely what some in the US defense establishment are arguing
for. **[In order to prevent what American defense hawks have called a
potential maritime "Iron Curtain" from being pulled down over the Arctic
by Russia, calls are being made for a more aggressive US naval posture
in the region, expanding the Barents Sea Patrol to incorporate so-called
Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) as standard practice for US
and NATO naval operations in the Arctic north. ]{.underline}**

**[The US has regularly asserted its right to navigate international
waters consistent with]{.underline}** the United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea (**[UNCLOS]{.underline}**), despite not having signed
the agreement (the US sidesteps this inconvenient fact by viewing the
provisions of UNCLOS it finds acceptable to operate as common law.)
Since 1983, **[the US Navy has conducted more than 400 FONOPs designed
to challenge what it views as excessive maritime claims]{.underline}**.
The proponents of expanded FONOPs in the Arctic view such exercises as a
prerequisite for countering perceived Russian domination of the Arctic
region.

One of the **[guiding principles of any US/NATO FONOPs conducted in the
Arctic Sea will be to push back on what these nations view as
excessively restrictive Russian national legislation based on[ UNCLOS'
Article
234 ](https://sites.tufts.edu/lawofthesea/chapter-eight/)]{.underline}**governing
operations in Arctic waters. As things currently stand, **[Russia views
the Northeast Passage]{.underline}** (called the **[Northern Sea
Route]{.underline}** in Russia) **[as being exclusively within Russian
territorial waters,]{.underline}** and as such traditional freedom of
navigation rights do not apply. Instead, Russia has implemented a series
of laws which, by placing restrictions on building construction, ship
navigation [capabilities](https://www.rt.com/russia/445245-new-rules-russia-arctic/),
and permit requirements, all but precludes freedom of navigation. It
**[should be noted that Russian laws mirror in many respects those of
Canada, which -- like Russia -- uses Article 234 as the basis of its
restrictive domestic legislation governing the transit of ships in its
territorial Arctic waters.]{.underline}**

![RT](media/image1.jpeg){width="3.9166666666666665in"
height="3.847037401574803in"}

Russian and Canadian interpretation of the rights afforded them under
Article 234 are coming under legal challenge by nations such as the US,
which want access to the economic potential of the Arctic which are
emerging as the ice sheet is pushed back by the effects of global
warming. 

**[Protecting Russian vested interests in the economic benefits that can
be accrued]{.underline}** (President Vladimir Putin has[ assessed the
value](https://apnews.com/8df6e2753db245b0ba887d20b6fcf340) of the
mineral deposits in Russia's Arctic region as approximately \$30
trillion) **[by exploiting the reduced ice exposure of the Arctic region
are a major reason behind Russia's forward-leaning posture in the
region.]{.underline}**

But there is another critical factor at play, which changes the dynamics
of any FONOP-type operation. "**[Innocent passage" is a critical concept
behind any viable FONOP exercise]{.underline}**---**[military vessels
must be engaged in non-hostile transit activity]{.underline}**. However,
**[US and NATO vessels that would conduct future FONOPs in the Arctic
Sea are armed with Aegis surface-to-air missiles and sea-launched cruise
missiles that would threaten Russian strategic rocket forces stationed
in Siberia. ]{.underline}**

The US is in the process of developing advanced[ SM-3 Block
IIA](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2020/02/sm-3-block-iia-set-for-first-ever-icbm-intercept-test/) surface-to-air
missiles which can be launched from the[ Mark 41 Vertical Launch
System](http://www.seaforces.org/wpnsys/SURFACE/Mk-41-missile-launcher.htm) (VLS)
employed on Aegis-capable ships. These new interceptors are **[capable
of intercepting intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBMs)]{.underline}** and will be **[tested in this configuration in
the third quarter of 2020]{.underline}**. Given the fact that the
**[vast majority of Russia's strategic nuclear force---especially those
elements of which are stationed in Siberia]{.underline}**---are
configured to fly over the Arctic Sea region before reaching their
targets in the United States, **[any US naval deployment in the Arctic
Sea armed with these weapons could not be seen as
innocent]{.underline}**.

The **[Mark 41 VLS is also configured to launch sea-launched cruise
missiles (SLCMs).]{.underline}** As part of the 2018 Nuclear Posture
Review, **[the US Navy is developing a new nuclear capable SLCM, known
as the SLCM-N, which will be armed with a W-80-4 thermonuclear warhead
with a variable yield of 5-150 kilotons. Any ship]{.underline}** armed
with SLCM-N weapons that is **[operating in the Arctic Sea region will
possess an inherent first-strike interdiction capability against
Russia's strategic nuclear forces]{.underline}**---again, a capability
**[which makes the transit of such vessels anything but
innocent.]{.underline}**

**[Russia currently has six military bases in the north, along with 10
airfields, numerous anti-aircraft missile system positions and military
ports operating under the umbrella of the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic
Command, better known simply as the Arctic forces]{.underline}**. The
**[anti-aircraft defenses]{.underline}** include the Tor-M2DT, a
modernized variant of the Soviet-era SA-15 system, and the newer
Pantsir-SA system, both of which **[have been adapted to operating in
the harsh environment of the Arctic north. These systems are designed to
defend against cruise missile attacks, and are on 24-hour alert, 365
days per year. ]{.underline}**

Seen in this light, **[the Russian militarization of the Arctic is more
defensive than offensive and intended to protect the vital national
security interests of Moscow from threats such as those that would be
presented through any aggressive US/NATO FONOPs in the Arctic
Sea.]{.underline}**

Moreover, **[Russia has a histor]{.underline}**y, dating back to Soviet
times, **[of aggressively defending its national security interests from
what it believes to be the encroachment on its territorial waters by
FONOPs which violate the requirement of innocent passage]{.underline}**.
Perhaps the most relevant example of this is found in the ramming
incident that transpired off the coast of the Crimean Peninsula on
February 12, 1988. **[The US Navy had dispatched a two-ship task force,
consisting of the cruiser USS Yorktown and the destroyer USS Caron, to
conduct FONOPs outside of traditional sea lanes.]{.underline}**

The US claimed it had every right to operate outside these sea lanes,
citing innocent passage. The Soviets, however, viewed the presence of
two modern warships, more heavily armed than any previous FONOP
exercise, as anything but innocent, and dispatched two frigates to
challenge the US naval presence. After warning both the Yorktown and
Caron to depart, and having these warnings ignored, the Soviet ships
proceeded to ram the US navy ships to compel their departure. There can
be little doubt that the Russian navy would employ similar tactics---or
more---to protect its interests in the Arctic Sea it felt threatened by
US/NATO FONOPs that did not meet the criterion of innocent passage.

**[If the US decides to beef up its naval presence in the Arctic region,
expanding the current Barents Sea Patrol to incorporate more aggressive
FONOPs along Russia's Northern Sea Route, one can anticipate that Russia
will]{.underline}** respond in kind, creating the potential for a
**[repeat of the Yorktown/Caron incident in the frigid waters of the
Arctic north]{.underline}**. In this day and age of renewed Cold
War-like tensions between the US/NATO and Russia, **[the last thing
either side needs is a new point of potential force-on-force
friction.]{.underline}**

### No Arctic War\-\--1NC

#### No Arctic war -- their authors are [hype]{.underline}. 

**Murray 16** --- Robert, Vice-President of Research at the Frontier
Centre for Public Policy and an Adjunct Professor at the University of
Alberta ,5-16-2016, \"Do Not Oversell the Russian Threat in the

accessed 7-3-2022 //THS---OLW

When doing a cursory search of articles and commentaries about the
current state of Arctic international relations, **[you
would]{.underline}** be forgiven if you were to **[think the Russians
are preparing to launch a massive offensive against other Arctic
states]{.underline}**, particularly Canada. The oft-repeated narrative
surrounding the Arctic is that the Russians are building up their
northern military capabilities as part of their neo-imperial ambitions
and to turn the Arctic into a sphere of geopolitical competition,
tension, and conflict. **[There is reason for this
narrative]{.underline}** to not only survive, but **[to grow in its
sensationalism]{.underline}**. Russia's provocativeness, actions, and
statements from Russian officials do little to allay fears. For scholars
of foreign and defense policy, as well as casual observers, a potential
conflict with the Russians in the Arctic would be of great interest.
**[For media outlets, the idea of [conflict in the Arctic continues to
serve as click-bait]{.mark}, and so the sensationalism
continues.]{.underline}** The problem, however, is that **[[very little
of this narrative is grounded in reality]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
Arctic has certainly emerged as an arena of vast interest in recent
years, and rightfully so. Northern climates continue to change and there
are greater opportunities for access, as well as the possibility of
resource wealth. As such, more attention has been paid to affairs in the
circumpolar region. Covering approximately 4 percent of the Earth's
surface at 20,000,000 square kilometers with an estimated 4 million
people, the Arctic is far more complex than a simple calculation about
Russia's investments in military technology. **[[Arctic
i]{.mark}nternational [relations are based on interstate cooperation,
indigenous]{.mark} [engagement, scientific and enviro]{.mark}nmental
[collaboration]{.mark}, and [is seeing an emerging global governance
architecture]{.mark} through bodies like the Arctic Council designed to
provide a forum for]{.underline}** future cooperation, **[resource
sharing and to ensure diplomacy, rather than conflict. [This continues
to be the]{.mark} predominant [norm.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Despite the
existing cooperative dynamics in the Arctic, there are reasons for
concern and important historical lessons to bear in mind. The Arctic is
not immune from geopolitics and other international political events,
and it is still very much impacted by the international system's
anarchic structure and great power politics. Circumpolar relations
involve multiple actors, including the eight Arctic states,
Arctic-interested states, international institutions, indigenous groups,
and NGOs. All are contributing to an increasingly complex Arctic
political landscape. This complexity is leading to concerns over states'
intentions in the region, and how other states and institutions react.
Russia has been generating the most attention for its recent Arctic
behavior, primarily due to the ongoing militarization of its Arctic
territory and fears about whether Russia's actions in Crimea, eastern
Ukraine, and Syria might somehow foreshadow aggression in the north.
Given the fact that Russia's Arctic policy has included an expansion of
permanent military forces, new military bases, new air force divisions,
new military technologies, and massive military exercises, it is
understandable that other Arctic states would be paying close attention
to Russia's Arctic moves. However, **[[the "Arctic conflict" narrative
assumes that Russia wants to be an aggressor]{.mark} in the region. This
line of thinking existed before Russia's annexation of
Crimea]{.underline}** and its incursions into eastern Ukraine, but those
events have sparked more debate about whether Russia's international
behavior is inherently aggressive and whether Russia might use the
Arctic as another theater in a new Cold War. **[[The Arctic is not
immune to the rules of the international system]{.mark} and great power
politics. [It is]{.mark} thus [highly unlikely that Russia would risk
conflict]{.mark} with the United States and other NATO states in the
Arctic. [There is little to gain]{.mark} by doing so and conflict would
disrupt the emerging balance of power in the Arctic. If Russia was to
initiate conflict in the circumpolar region, it would [unilaterally
disrupt the existing cooperative framework]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### No Arctic War\-\--2NC

#### Arctic war is unlikely -- harsh conditions and new systems are less aggressive. 

**Schaller 16** --- Benjamin, PhD, research fellow at the Centre for
Peace Studies, Arctic University of Norway @ Tromsø, 3-9-2016,
\"Deconstructing the Narrative of Arctic War,\" World Policy,
<https://worldpolicy.org/2016/03/09/deconstructing-the-narrative-of-arctic-war/>,
accessed 7-3-2022 //THS---OLW

Natural Resources, Territorial Claims, and Militarization? First, what
would be the source of a potential Arctic conflict? For many observers
this seems to be very clear: economic interest. In 2008, a U.S.
Geological Survey considered the Arctic to contain most of the world's
still undeveloped oil and gas. In addition, as the ice melts, lucrative
shipping routes, like the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route,
are becoming more and more accessible. Since then, nearly every national
submission to the extension of the Arctic state's continental shelf (and
thus the right to exploit the resources in the seabed) is considered a
"provocative," sometimes even "offensive" act. **[This entirely
disregards the actual nature of this process, which is nothing more than
a filing of scientific findings to a scientific body, the U.N.
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. The commission will
assess the findings and make recommendations]{.underline}**, but lacks a
mandate to resolve possible overlapping claims. However, **[[the Arctic
has a long history of resolving]{.mark} such [disputes peacefully and in
line with i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}, such as in 2011 between
Norway and Russia. There is also little reason why this should change in
the near future]{.underline}**. Hans Island, a "rock" in the Nares
Strait between Canada and Greenland, became sort of a symbol for
territorial disputes in the Arctic, as militaries from both states
started to leave each other bottles of Danish schnapps or Canadian Club
whiskey as well as welcome signs. **[Then, in August 2015, Russia
indicated its willingness to negotiate its overlapping claims with
Denmark in regards to the North Pole. Other remaining [overlapping
claims]{.mark} also [carry little potential for military
escalation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Second, what would war in the Arctic
actually look like**[? It is probably not too surprising that the
[military presence]{.mark} in the Arctic [is]{.mark} comparably [low,
considering]{.mark} that the Arctic is covered mainly by a large ocean
and [temperatures]{.mark} in winter can drop below -40 degrees
Celsius]{.underline}**. Historically, the High North continuously played
an important geostrategic role, hosting, for example, Russia's strategic
nuclear missiles and air defense systems as well as serving as a
"natural habitat" for strategic missile submarines. However, **[the
[harsh climate poses severe challenges to people and equipment,
making]{.mark} a military [presence]{.mark} in the Arctic very costly
and often primarily [symbolic]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Denmark's
"Slædepatruljen SIRIUS," an elite Danish navy unit, is a good
illustration of this. The 14 soldiers of the unit split up in teams of
two, patrolling 9942 miles of northeastern Greenland on dogsleds.
Because very low temperatures make rifles operating with gas much less
reliable, the soldiers are equipped with the M1917 Enfield, a rifle used
during the first World War. Its main purpose is less military, but
rather to protect them from straying polar bears. **[As former Canadian
Chief of Defense Staff General Natynczyk put it: "If someone were to
invade the Canadian Arctic, my first task would be to rescue
them."]{.underline}** This leads directly to the last question: who
would this "someone" be? Most recently, after Russia's illegal
annexation of Crimea and the subsequent significant freeze in
NATO-Russia relations, many seem to argue at least for one side of a
military conflict in the Arctic. Russia's military modernization
program, the reopening of military infrastructure, changes in its
maritime doctrine, and strong statements by high-level officials, such
as by Deputy Prime Minister Rogozin or Defense Minister Shoigu, to feed
suspicion about Russia's ambitions in the Arctic. At the same time, it
is advisable to take a sober second look at what is actually happening
on the ground**[. As for most of the Arctic coastal states, the [thawing
ice]{.mark} and expected increase in shipping call for additional search
and rescue capabilities and [makes Russia]{.mark}'s northern border more
[vulnerable]{.mark} to security challenges]{.underline}** such as
piracy, terrorism, and trafficking. With **[this in mind, [new]{.mark}
air defense [systems]{.mark}, radar sites, airfields, border
infrastructure, icebreakers, and patrol vessels [are less an issue of
aggressive]{.mark} military power [projection]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At
the same time, Russia recently carried out several large-scale and
unannounced military exercises, some also involving its troops in the
Arctic. It would nevertheless be wrong to directly link these exercises
to Russia's regional ambitions rather than to a general shift in its
policy towards the West and, in particular, towards NATO. **[Even if one
rejects the history of close cooperation in the Arctic, a similar shift
in Russian policy towards confrontation in the High North seems very
unlikely]{.underline}**. The **[main reason for such a conclusion is
that [only through playing by the rules will Russia be]{.mark} [entitled
to]{.mark} the largest share of the unexploited [resources in the
Arctic]{.mark}---more than it will be able to exploit in the next 100
years]{.underline}**. **[Even more so, [Russia will need to cooperate
since]{.mark} the harsh Arctic [climate makes]{.mark} search and rescue,
oil and gas [production]{.mark}, and border security]{.underline}**,
**[particularly [risky]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[technologically
challenging]{.underline}**, **[and consequently very expensive
tasks.]{.underline}** Any announcement of unilateral action must thus be

pushes fish stocks northward.12

**[[Tapping these resources is Russia's primary economic

**[require expanding icebreaking capabilities and developing ports,

Finally, **[[Russia aspires to transform]{.mark} its northern coast into

Accessed 7-5-2022, LASA-SC)

The **[biggest problem with cable systems is not
technological]{.underline}** -- **[it's human]{.underline}**. Because
they run underground, underwater and between telephone poles, **[cable
systems populate the same spaces we d]{.underline}**o. As a result,
**[we]{.underline}** accidentally **[break them all the
time]{.underline}**. Local construction projects dig up terrestrial
lines. Boaters drop anchors on cables. And **[submarines can pinpoint
systems under the sea.]{.underline}**

Most of the recent media coverage has been dominated by the question of
vulnerability. **[Are global communications networks really at risk of
disruption?]{.underline}** What would happen if these cables were cut?
Do we need to worry about the threat of sabotage from Russian subs or
terrorist agents?

The answer to this is not black and white. **[Any individual cable is
always at risk,]{.underline}** **[but likely far more so from boaters
and fishermen than any saboteur]{.underline}**. **[Over history, the
single largest cause of disruption has been people unintentionally
dropping anchors and nets]{.underline}**. The International Cable
Protection Committee has been working for years to prevent such breaks.

As a result, **[cables today are covered in steel armor and buried
beneath the seafloor at their shore-ends, where the human threat is most
concentrated]{.underline}**. This provides some level of protection. In
the deep sea, the ocean's inaccessibility largely safeguards cables --
they need only to be covered with a thin polyethelene sheath. It's not
that it's much more difficult to sever cables in the deep ocean, it's
just that the primary forms of interference are less likely to happen.
The sea is so big and the cables are so narrow, the probability isn't
that high that you'd run across one.

**[Sabotage has actually been rare in the history of undersea
cables]{.underline}**. **[There are certainly occurrences]{.underline}**
(though none recently**[), but these are disproportionately
publicized]{.underline}**. The World War I German raid of the Fanning
Island cable station in the Pacific Ocean gets a lot of attention.
**[And there was speculation about sabotage in the cable disruptions
outside Alexandria, Egypt in 2008, which cut 70% of the country's
internet, affecting millions]{.underline}**. **[Yet we hear little about
the regular faults that occur, on average, about 200 times each
year.]{.underline}**

### Aff Fails \-\-- 1NC

#### Aff fails -- they would just [move farther into the ocean]{.underline} -- military might can't prevent attacks.

**Barker 18** -- Lieutenant Commander Peter Barker is a serving Royal
Navy officer and barrister. He is currently the Associate Director for
the Law of Coalition Warfare at the Stockton Center for the Study of
International Law. (Peter, \"Undersea Cables and the Challenges of

https://cimsec.org/undersea-cables-challenges-protecting-seabed-lines-communication/,
Accessed 7-5-2022, LASA-SC)

Clearly, **[a]{.underline}** **[protection strategy]{.underline}**
**[for undersea cables cannot depend]{.underline}**
**[solely]{.underline}** **[on military action]{.underline}**. **[It
is]{.underline}** **[impossible]{.underline}** **[to protect the entire
cable network given its global expanse]{.underline}**. **[The geographic
area requiring protection is simply too large, even for the most
powerful of navies]{.underline}**. The natural consequence of this
conclusion is to focus on identifying and intercepting ships and
submarines capable of interfering with the cable network. **[However,
the practicalities of this option are not promising]{.underline}**.
**[The technology required to tamper with cables is not overly
sophisticated. It can be hosted in a wide range of vessels and easily
transferred between them.]{.underline}** **[Submarines present
additional challenges in monitoring, tracking and interception,
requiring the use of satellites, intelligence, and underwater
sensors]{.underline}**. For a military commander, **[the task of
protecting seabed submarine cables from attack can seem almost
impossible.]{.underline}**

Given this conclusion, **[national strategies may need to focus on
alternative methods of safeguarding the exchange of
information]{.underline}**. One method would be to **[increase the level
of redundancy within the system by laying additional
cables]{.underline}**. **[As cables are expensive and most cables are
privately owned, additional routes have to be assured of sufficient
funding to make them viable]{.underline}**. Somewhat ominously, the
International Cable Protection Committee (which represents cable owners)
states that "**[most cable owners feel that there is enough diversity in
the international submarine cable network]{.underline}**." This might be
true if the only threat is from accidental damage. However, this
analysis might change with the realistic prospect of deliberate
targeting.

### Aff Fails \-\-- 2NC

#### Redundancy solves BUT the impact is inevitable -- they're IMPOSSIBLE to monitor

**Starosielski 15** -- Nicole Starosielski is from the New York

Accessed 7-5-2022, LASA-SC)

The fact is **[it's]{.underline}** **[incredibly
difficult]{.underline}** **[to monitor these lines]{.underline}**.
**[Cable companies have been trying to do so for more than a
century]{.underline}**, since the first telegraph lines were laid in the
1800s. **[But the ocean is too vast and the lines simply too
long]{.underline}**. **[It would be impossible to stop every vessel that
came anywhere near critical communications cables]{.underline}**.
**[We'd need to create extremely long, "no-go" zones across the
ocean]{.underline}**, **[which itself would profoundly disrupt the
economy.]{.underline}**

Fewer than 300 cable systems transport almost all transoceanic traffic
around the world. **[And these often run through narrow pressure points
where small disruptions can have massive impacts]{.underline}**. Since
each cable can carry an extraordinary amount of information, it's not
uncommon for an entire country to rely on only a handful of systems. In
many places, it would take only a few cable cuts to take out large
swathes of the internet. If the right cables were disrupted at the right
time, it could disrupt global internet traffic for weeks or even months.

**[The thing that protects global information traffic is the fact that
there's some redundancy built into the system]{.underline}**. **[Since
there is more cable capacity than there is traffic, when there is a
break, information is automatically rerouted along other
cables.]{.underline}** **[Because there are many systems linking to the
United States, and a lot of internet infrastructure is located here, a
single cable outage is unlikely to cause any noticeable effect for
Americans.]{.underline}**

"**[Government and industry should continue to secure the communications

well as working with allies and partners to beef up best practices to
secure facilities and enhance resilience, and to share information on

### U.S. Naval Dom Inev

#### U.S. naval dominance is [locked in]{.underline} and [inevitable]{.underline}\-\--any factor that affects us is [worse]{.underline} for competitors 

Robert **Kaplan 17**, senior fellow at the Center for a New American
Security and a senior advisor at Eurasia Group, 1/24/17, "America Is a
Maritime Nation,"
<http://www.realclearworld.com/articles/2017/01/24/america_is_a_maritime_nation_112189.html>

The United States, bordered by two oceans, is a maritime nation. **[Not
only is its Navy the largest in the world by far]{.underline}**, but
**[its coast guard would qualify as the 12th largest
fleet]{.underline}** in the world. **[The U.S. Navy is America\'s
foremost strategic instrument]{.underline}** \-- much more so than its
nuclear arsenal, which in all probability can never be used. The U.S.
Navy is on the high seas around the world in peacetime as well as in
wartime, guarding the sea lines of communication and the main maritime
choke points. This, in turn, allows for a free global trading regime and
guarantees access to hydrocarbons for America\'s allies. This Navy, by
the way, also allows for an inland strike capacity. To wit, America
bombed Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo from warships in the Indian Ocean
and the Adriatic Sea.

Historically, America is not unique in this regard. Athens, Venice, and
Great Britain were all great global maritime powers. So were Holland and
Portugal. Maritime powers, with exceptions of course, were generally
more benign than land powers such as Germany and Russia. For while
armies invade, ships make port visits and facilitate commerce. Navies
also do not occupy foreign territory to anywhere near the extent that
land forces do. While armies are required for unpredictable
contingencies, navies (and air forces) project power on a daily basis.
America might have gotten into unnecessary wars in Vietnam and Iraq, but
**[American power is undiminished, largely because of the size of its
Navy]{.underline}** and Air Force. Finally, **[the U.S. Navy helps keep
America engaged but out of trouble]{.underline}**.

If we consider ourselves a maritime nation, chances are that we will
make fewer mistakes in foreign policy, since naval power is about
protecting commerce and a free trading order more than about having
imperial-like possessions and interests. This is why a Navy can deploy
anywhere all the time, though sending large numbers of ground troops
overseas often involves a debate in Congress.

**[The U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[currently has a
Navy with almost 300 warships. This is an important fact]{.underline}**,
since **[if America\'s Navy had only, say, 200]{.underline}** warships,
**[the world]{.underline}** would be a very different place. It **[would
be considerably more violent and anarchic]{.underline}** than it already
is. The U.S. 7th Fleet essentially keeps the peace in East Asia, while
the U.S. 5th Fleet helps prevent war between Iran and the Arabian Gulf
states, including Saudi Arabia.

**[This 300-ship Navy]{.underline}**, combined with America\'s other
armed services, **[gives the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[more power than any other nation in the
world. Yet]{.underline}** we must keep in mind that **[this considerable
power does not equal overwhelming power]{.underline}**. It is in the
space between these two concepts that much of the violence and
instability in the world takes place. For **[even a 600-ship
Navy]{.underline}**, or even an army much larger than our present one,
**[would be unable to prevent the collapse of states across the Middle
East]{.underline}**. America, in other words, while guarding its
interests, must be prepared to tolerate a world where it is not in
control.

Let me elaborate on this.

**[America\'s ability to influence the world will likely decrease, but
the ability of other powers to do likewise will also
decrease]{.underline}** over time, **[owing to internal economic
challenges in China, Russia, and Europe that dwarf
America\'s]{.underline}** own economic problems. Thus **[our power will
increase relative to other major states]{.underline}** and unions,
**[even as it decreases in absolute terms]{.underline}** around the
world. In all this, our Navy will be a barometer for our national
health: this is because maritime platforms are frightfully expensive,
thus the ability to maintain a Navy the size of ours requires public
support through taxes and a healthy rate of increase in the gross
domestic product.

A big Navy says a lot about who we are. And **[given the structural
economic weaknesses of China, Russia, and Europe]{.underline}**, I
believe **[it is questionable whether they can keep up with the U.S.
Navy over the long run]{.underline}**. The big unknown is not Russia,
which is a near-term threat rather than a long-term one, but China: Can
it really reform its economy? I am not sure.

For Taiwan and its friends, however, **[the situation is
not]{.underline}** as **[dire]{.underline}** as portrayed by those
warning that Beijing will soon opt for war even in the absence of a
major provocation from Taiwan.

For domestic political reasons, **[[China is]{.mark} extremely [unlikely

choice **[against [Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the next year.

Even with the PLA's improved capabilities, **[military [action]{.mark}
against Taiwan [is]{.mark} an extremely [risky]{.mark} proposition for
China]{.underline}**. An attempted invasion across the strait would
involve the largest and most complex amphibious operation in history,
and this by a military with no significant combat experience since 1979,
when it performed badly in a border war against Vietnam. China could
more confidently capture one of the ROC's smaller outlying islands or
impose a blockade on Taiwan's major ports, but neither of these
approaches would guarantee Taipei's surrender.

Chinese analyst Cui Lei of the China Institute of International
Relations recently argued that **[Chinese [leaders]{.mark} feel

Taiwan, [but]{.mark} have [no intent]{.mark}ion to launch a military

that **[military [action is daunting]{.mark} because [Taiwan]{.mark}'s
people [will not submit without a fight]{.mark}]{.underline}**; the
United States would help defend Taiwan out of fear of losing U.S.
leadership in the region; **[[China is not]{.mark} as militarily
[strong]{.mark}]{.underline}** as the United States; **[[war would cause
discontent]{.mark} in China; [and]{.mark} the international [backlash
would derail]{.mark} China's progress toward
[modernization]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

As is required of any paramount leader in China, Xi affirms his
commitment to unification. But how deeply Xi is committed to the
objective of making Taiwan a province of the PRC during his tenure is
unknown. There are other issue areas where he could strive for
accomplishments to bolster his legacy, such as cleaning up and
rejuvenating the CCP, presiding over successful restructuring of the
Chinese economy, ushering China out of the "middle income trap," and of
course blessing humanity with Xi Jinping Thought.

The notion that Chinese aggressiveness on other fronts presages an
attack on Taiwan is questionable. The consequence of that aggressiveness
is that China simultaneously suffers from poor or damaged relations with
India, Japan (due to the Senkaku-Diaoyu Islands dispute), Australia
(economic coercion), some of the Southeast Asian states (the South China
Sea dispute), and the United States (on several issues). On top of this,
**[[China is battling]{.underline}]{.mark}** against **[accelerated
economic [decoupling]{.mark}, which could slow Chinese economic
development. Already dealing with multiple [crises in]{.mark} its
foreign [relations]{.mark} is more likely to [give Beijing pause]{.mark}
than to encourage the Chinese leadership to initiate an additional,
larger crisis]{.underline}**. The situations of **[Hong Kong and
Taiwan]{.underline}**, their relationships to Beijing, and the PRC's
policies toward them **[are]{.underline}** **[completely
distinct]{.underline}**. The imposition of the National Security Law in
Hong Kong is the culmination of political struggle that dates back to
2002 and is disconnected from PLA readiness to go to war with Taiwan.

### U.S. Involve = War

#### Getting in China's way inflames tensions

Peter **Martin 22**, Peter Martin is a defense industry journalist with
a degree in journalism, 6/12/22, "China alarms U.S. with new private
warnings to avoid Taiwan Strait: 'We're seeing growing coercion from
Beijing'," *Fortune*,

**[Chinese [military officials]{.mark} in recent months have [repeatedly
asserted that the [Taiwan
Strait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Strait) isn't international
waters]{.mark}]{.underline}** during meetings with U.S. counterparts,
according to a person familiar with the situation, generating concern
within the Biden administration. 

**[The statement [disputing]{.mark} the [U.S. view of international
law]{.mark} has been delivered to the American government by Chinese
officials on multiple occasions and at multiple levels]{.underline}**,
the person said. The U.S. and key allies say much of the strait
constitutes international waters, and they routinely send naval vessels
through the waterway as part of freedom of navigation exercises. 

**[China has
long [asserted](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/3004863/us-warships-and-pla-jets-whats-really-behind-taiwan-strait?module=perpetual_scroll_0&pgtype=article&campaign=3004863) that
the [Taiwan Strait is part of its e]{.mark}xclusive [e]{.mark}conomic
[z]{.mark}one]{.underline}**, and takes the view there are limits to the
activities of foreign military vessels in those waters. While China
regularly [protests](https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-protests-us-navy-destroyers-taiwan-strait) U.S.
military moves in the Taiwan Strait, the legal status of the waters
previously wasn't a regular talking point in meetings with American
officials. 

**[It's not clear whether the recent assertions indicate that China will
take more steps to confront naval vessels that enter transit the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}**. The U.S. also conducts freedom of navigation
operations in the South China Sea to challenge Chinese territorial
claims around disputed land features. 

**[The Pentagon didn't immediately respond to a request for
comment]{.underline}**. China's Foreign Ministry also didn't immediately
respond outside of normal business hours.

### No China War \-\-- 1NC

#### **China war has no escalation.**

7-24-2020, \"Despite heated talk, risk of a US-China hot war is small\",
*South China Morning Post*,
<https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3094121/why-risk-us-china-hot-war-small-despite-heated-talk>)

**[[Many]{.underline}]{.mark}** observers **[are [pessimistic about
deteriorating]{.mark} US-China [relations]{.mark} and believe the two
countries are heading towards]{.underline}** a cold
**[war]{.underline}**. Even worse, **[some argue that the situation
might be more dangerous than the US-Soviet Union Cold War, and that a
hot war might break out between the two. This [argument is]{.mark}
[unconvincing]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[First]{.underline}** of all,
**[[deterrents]{.mark} to a flare-up are]{.underline}** much
**[[strong]{.underline}]{.mark}**er **[in US-China relations than in
US-Soviet relations]{.underline}**. Although economic and
people-to-people ties between China and the US are declining, they are
still close compared to US-Soviet ties. **[It is [hard to
decouple]{.mark} two closely intertwined [economies]{.mark} and
societies.]{.underline}** Take two examples. **[China is expected to
become the world\'s largest consumer market, a temptation hard to resist
for exporters, including those from the US. And in education, more than
300,000 Chinese students study in the US, bringing in huge revenues for
the US education industry]{.underline}**. Many universities go to great
lengths to woo international students. Recently Harvard and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology even sued the government over its
new visa restrictions, now aborted, on international students.
**[Second, even if there is decoupling, the pain would not be too great
and can be kept out of the national security sphere]{.underline}** if
properly handled. In fact, for national security reasons, a modest
degree of isolation will make both sides more secure and comfortable.
For instance, if China's information technology equipment cannot capture
Western markets, the US will be more relaxed. If China cannot get
advanced technologies from the US and its technological progress slows
down, the US will be less anxious. In the same vein, China feels assured
knowing that if the Trump administration does impose a travel ban on
Communist Party members, it would be abandoning one of the tools
available to the US to promote "peaceful evolution" in China. Economic
decoupling is undeniably more painful for China than for the US. But
unlike Japan during WWII, which was hit hard by the US oil embargo
because of its lack of natural resources, China has no such problems.
Given its large domestic market, losing the US as a major customer is
not a disaster for China, and can be compensated through more dynamic
economic activities at home. China can also make up for being freezed
out of technological exchanges by turning to indigenous innovation. As
for the US, it can import goods from other developing countries, albeit
less cheaply. The relative loss is acceptable when weighed against the
heightened perception of economic independence and security. **[Third,
the [ideological confrontation]{.mark} between China and the US [is less
intense]{.mark}]{.underline}** than that during the Cold War. Unlike the
obsession with ideology in those days, **[the line between capitalism
and socialism is blurred today. The market economy has become
universally recognised as the best way to promote economic
growth]{.underline}** and, politically, many countries have embraced
democracy. Even North Korea calls itself the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea. Although ideological hawks in the US still long for
the day when the beacon of freedom will light up the world, **[after
many years of fighting bloody wars overseas, most American people are
not interested in promoting democracy abroad]{.underline}**. Meanwhile,
**[[China just wants to]{.mark} [preserve its]{.mark} political
[system]{.mark} and has [no]{.mark} interest in [exporting]{.mark} it to
other countries, as the Soviet Union did. Thus, ideological antagonism
in China-US relations can easily be eased by calculations of realistic
interests, which create conditions for compromise and cooperation.
Fourth, both China and the US have many [options other than war]{.mark}
to achieve their policy goals]{.underline}**. While they have no allies
to serve as a buffer, given the nature of the potential conflict in the
South China Sea or Taiwan Strait, **[both countries are [adept
at]{.mark} operating in [grey zones]{.mark} and fighting psychological,
public opinion or diplomatic warfare [below]{.mark} the threshold of
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The forced closure of the Chinese consulate
in Houston by the US government is just the latest act of brinkmanship.
In addition, **[given China's huge economic and financial interests in
the [US]{.mark}, the latter can [wield the stick of sanctions]{.mark}
when use of force is highly risky or not worth it.]{.underline}**
**[When both sides have many tools and options, why would they rush to
war to achieve their goals? [Last]{.mark}]{.underline}** but not least,
**[[the imbalance of power]{.mark} will [act as a
deterrent]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Some say the US and Soviet Union did
not fight a hot war because they were evenly matched. It was not the
case, actually. At the beginning of the Cold War, the Soviet Union was
at a relative military disadvantage. Moreover, **[a country needs the
will to fight before going to war, even if it is stronger militarily
than its adversary. Having fought years of meaningless wars, the US is
weary of war]{.underline}**. **[[China]{.mark}, too, [abhors
war]{.mark}. Having a clear understanding of US strength, [especially
when its]{.mark} own [economy is slowing]{.mark} down and it is facing
various domestic challenges]{.underline}**, **[China would not wish to
recklessly start a war with the US. In summary, the [possibility]{.mark}
of a hot war between China and the US is [very
small]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The greatest danger for China is not a
cold or hot confrontation with the US, but policymakers' interpretation
of the momentary hostility towards Beijing of a portion of the American
population and the larger world. An erroneous interpretation could end
China's march to further opening up, and see it turn instead towards
self-isolation.

### No China war

#### No US-China war\-\--Talmadge is wrong

Dennis C. **Blair 19**, Chairman of the Board and Distinguished Senior
Fellow (Non-Resident) of Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA, Would China Go
Nuclear?
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-12-11/would-china-go-nuclear

**[[Talmadge's]{.underline}]{.mark}** basic
**[[argument]{.underline}]{.mark}** is **[that]{.underline}**
**[in]{.underline}** any **[conflict with China]{.underline}**, the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[will]{.underline}**
immediately **[launch a]{.underline}** full-scale air and **[missile
[assault]{.mark} against military targets [in mainland
China]{.mark}]{.underline}** and against Chinese attack submarines at
sea. **[In so doing]{.underline}**, she argues, the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[will inadvertently
hit]{.underline}** either **[China's]{.underline}** ballistic missile
submarines or its **[mobile nuclear missiles]{.underline}**.
**[That]{.underline}**, in turn, **[will present Chinese leaders with a
"use it]{.underline}** **[or lose it" dilemma]{.underline}** concerning
their nuclear arsenal, **[and]{.underline}** they **[may]{.underline}**
well **[decide to launch]{.underline}** **[a nuclear
attack]{.underline}** against the United States.

**[Such a scenario [is]{.mark} extremely
[unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline}**; indeed, I would say **[[the odds
are]{.mark} somewhere between nil and [zero]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
**[A U.S.-Chinese conflict would be a maritime]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[campaign]{.underline}** **[in which the two sides]{.underline}**
**[tried to conquer or defend islands]{.underline}**.
**[[Attacks]{.mark} [on land]{.mark} targets]{.underline}**
**[[beyond]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[the contested islands and the
[waters]{.mark}]{.underline}** around them, whether carried out by the
United States against Chinese territory or by China against U.S.
overseas bases, **[would be aimed at]{.underline}** **[military
installations]{.underline}** and systems **[that supported
the]{.underline}** **[maritime
campaign]{.underline}**---**[ports]{.underline}**, **[air
bases]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** **[command-and-control
centers]{.underline}**. **[The [intercontinental]{.mark} nuclear
[deterrent forces]{.mark} of both countries [are physically
separate]{.mark} from these facilities]{.underline}**.

In addition, **[[U.S. planners are]{.underline}]{.mark}** very
[**[mindful]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of the danger of
attacking]{.underline}** any state's **[nuclear arsenal [and take
extraordinary precautions to avoid doing so]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[Although]{.underline}** **[there is always a chance for an isolated
mistake]{.underline}**, **[[it is]{.underline}]{.mark}** in fact
[**[possible]{.underline}** **[to distinguish]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[nuclear]{.underline}**-armed **[submarines]{.underline}** **[from
conventional ones]{.underline}**. Likewise, **[it is possible to
distinguish]{.underline}** the shorter-range, **[dual-use
[missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}**[that threaten Taiwan,
China's neighbors, [and]{.mark} U.S. [bases]{.mark} in the Pacific from
the]{.underline}** **[intercontinental missiles]{.underline}** **[that
threaten the United States]{.underline}**.

**[If by mistake a U.S. strike destroyed]{.underline}** a land-based
medium-range **[nuclear missile]{.underline}** or sank a ballistic
missile submarine, **[China would be]{.underline}** greatly
**[concerned]{.underline}**, **[but]{.underline}** **[[it is]{.mark}
highly [unlikely]{.mark} that [Beijing would]{.mark} respond
by]{.underline}** **[reflexively [launchi]{.mark}ng [a nuclear
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}** against the United States. Rather,
**[[before]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[even [considering
violating]{.mark}]{.underline}** their long-held "**[[n]{.mark}o
[fi]{.mark}rst [u]{.mark}se" doctrine,]{.underline}** **[Chinese
[leaders would wait]{.mark} to]{.underline}** **[see if a concerted,
sustained U.S. campaign]{.underline}** against their nuclear arsenal
**[was under way]{.underline}**. **[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[has no]{.mark} [incentive to attempt such a campaign]{.mark} and in
fact would take every precaution to avoid it.]{.underline}**

### China Not Revisionist

**China [isn't revisionist]{.underline}**

(Singapore); \*\*Nicholas Butts; Center for Strategic and International

<https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/JIPA/journals/Volume-02_Issue-4/McKinney.pdf>)

In the abstract, such claims are alarming---in context, and in balance,
rather humdrum. In fact, [the [**evidence** of]{.mark} a]{.underline}ny
[Chinese [intention to]{.mark}]{.underline} destroy, or even merely
**[[undermine]{.underline}]{.mark}** and exploit, [the current order [is
**slight**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[China]{.mark} **is**]{.underline}
certainly [using its]{.underline} growing [military power to
**[defend]{.mark}** its **[claims in the SCS]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
even---on occasion--- to coerce its neighbors. [It [uses]{.mark}
**[protectionist]{.mark}**]{.underline} economic
**[[policies]{.underline}]{.mark}** to boost the prospects of Chinese
companies and reduce competition. [It employs **economic
statecraft**]{.underline} to serve its interests abroad. And it
certainly is opposed to America's policy of global democracy promotion.
[However, **[none]{.mark}** of these positions **[fundamentally
challenge the existing order]{.mark}**, **none** of them **radically
depart** from America's **own actions** when it was a **rising
power**]{.underline} in the nineteenth century, [and [none]{.mark} of
them **obviously [surpass]{.mark}** [America's]{.mark} **own
[contemporary]{.mark} record** of **[order]{.mark}
subversion**]{.underline}.

When [the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates was a rising
power, it [took **half of Mexico**]{.underline} [and **considered taking
the rest**,]{.underline} [it **colonized** the **Philippines** and
**Hawaii**]{.underline}, [and it **unilaterally seized** the **maritime
choke points of the Caribbean**]{.underline} (Puerto Rico and Cuba).21
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [used
**tariffs**]{.underline}---which by 1857 averaged 20 percent22 and by
the end of the nineteenth century were "the highest import duties in the
industrial world"23---[to **protect its industries**]{.underline}. [It
**stole intellectual property**]{.underline},24 [and]{.underline} it
[**ideologically challenged** the governments of the "Old
World."]{.underline} Today, despite no longer being a rising power, [the
U]{.underline}nited [States has launched]{.underline} two **[disastrous
invasions]{.underline}**, **[tortured prisoners]{.underline}**, [and
dispatches **drone strikes at a whim** with **little international legal
authority**]{.underline}.25 The point is not that two wrongs make a
right; it is that [international order is **much more resilient** than
**critics seem to realize**]{.underline},26 [and it is **utopian** to
expect any **rising Great Power** to act in a way that **uniformly
satisfies** one's **moral scruples**,]{.underline} evolving, in
Friedberg's words, "into a mellow, satisfied, 'responsible' status quo
power."27

Friedberg or Harris might object that America's rise took place in the
context of a different order. This is perfectly true, but the more
important point is that the long nineteenth century (1815--1914)---the
era of America's rise---was the first iteration of the New Peace.28 The
implication is that [relative [peace **can**]{.mark} and **has**
**[coexist]{.mark}**ed [with **limited wars**, **property** and
**territorial thefts**]{.mark}, acts of **coercion**, and **aggressive
assertions of status.** This does not mean any of these are
**desirable**]{.underline}--- they are [not---but it shows that they
**need not be fatal to the system**]{.underline}. [Insofar as there
**is** a lesson from that **first period** of **relative peace**, it is
that [**Great Power confrontation** is]{.mark} the **[one thing that is
fatal]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Accepting this does not mean
**capitulating** in **every instance**, as implied by
some]{.underline},29 [but it **does** mean **rediscovering** the rules
of **Great Power competition**]{.underline}30 alongside the art of
strategy.31

Focusing only on areas that China's rise violates the scruples of the
established powers, moreover, downplays the extent to which
[[China]{.mark}, **has**]{.underline}, in fact, [[**conformed**
to]{.mark} the **[existing order]{.mark}.**]{.underline} As a RAND
Corporation report published in 2018 concludes, China has been a
supporter---albeit a conditional one---of the international order:
"Since [China [undertook a **policy of international
engagement**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the 1980s ... the level and quality
of its participation in the order rivals that of most other states."32
The way in which **[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Jinping, following his
2017 Davos speech in defense of globalization, [has been heralded as the
**[most prominent champion of international order]{.mark}** and
**defender of globalization**]{.underline} underscores the fact that
[there are **different elements** of this order, and that China supports
**many**, if not **most, of them**]{.underline}. [Even in places where
[China]{.mark} is **supposedly "altering"** the current order, Beijing
tends to simultaneously **[affirm that order]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[China's Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]{.underline}, for
instance, actually **[mirrors existing structures]{.underline}**, and
China has intentionally copied elements and "best practices" of the
World Bank and Asian Development Bank. [China is **playing the same
game**, even if it is **seeking a bigger role within
it**]{.underline}.33

#### [Empirics]{.underline} disprove Chinese revisionism---defensive realism has more explanatory power

**Jalil** **19** - Research Fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies
Islamabad (Ghazala,
<http://issi.org.pk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/3-SS_Ghazala_Yasmin_Jalil_No-1_2019.pdf>)

However, **[since the 1970s [China's]{.mark} policies have [shown less
revisionist tendencies]{.mark}. The country has increasingly become a
state that is embracing defensive realism.]{.underline}** One thread of
this evidence is that **[[China has toned-down]{.mark} its
[revolutionary rhetoric]{.mark}. It is]{.underline}** also **[not
supporting insurgencies]{.underline}** in other countries. The second
thread of evidence is that **[since the late 1970s China has
[increasingly pursued a cooperative]{.mark} security [approach]{.mark}
in its relations with regional neighbours and in the international
arena. By and large, China has tried to forge friendly
relations]{.underline}** with its neighbours. It **[includes
ameliorating relations [with]{.mark} states like
[India]{.mark}]{.underline}** which is traditionally a rival. Their
relations did become strained in 2017 when there was a standoff between
the Indian and the Chinese forces on the Doklam plateau. Dhoklam is a
territory claimed both by Bhutan (aligned with India) and China.
However, Indo-China relations improved as the two **[countries held an
informal summit in China in April 2018.]{.underline}**30 **[The two
countries even held a joint military exercise]{.underline}** in December
2018, **[called Hand-in-Hand.]{.underline}**31 Over the years, China has
also managed to resolve border issues with so many neighbouring states.
It has **[settled border disputes with]{.underline}** countries like
**[[Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}** initially **[and
recently with [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**, bordering the Central
Asian States **[[and Vietnam]{.mark}.]{.underline}**32 **[Moreover,
China has territorial disputes with]{.underline}** India and Japan but
**[it has never made these disputes a hurdle in forging friendly
ties]{.underline}** with these two countries. **[Avery Goldstein dubs it
a neo-Bismarckian grand strategy]{.underline}** of China **[whereby it
is pursuing its interests by reassuring those who may feel threatened
and may form anti-China alliances.]{.underline}**33 This, in his
opinion, **[has resulted in a security environment that is conducive for
China as well as for the region as a whole. Another
indication]{.underline}** that China does not show aggressive behaviour
in its policies **[is that [China]{.mark} has increasingly
[engaged]{.mark} and integrated with [the international
community]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Over the past 30 years, China has
amply demonstrated this by its increasing membership of international
organisations and institutions as well as membership of treaties since
the 1980s. China has increasingly participated in the regional
multilateral institutions over the years. **[In the last few decades,
East [Asia has seen]{.mark} a number of [regional institutions]{.mark}
being formed. Foremost among those are]{.underline}** the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (**[[APEC]{.underline}]{.mark}**); the ASEAN
Regional Forum (**[[ARF]{.underline}]{.mark}**); ASEAN plus 3
**[[and]{.mark} the East Asia [Summit. China is]{.mark} part of most of
these multilateral institutions as well as [an active member]{.mark} of
the]{.underline}** Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
(**[SCO]{.underline}**). China was also a key player in the
sixparty-talks in getting North Korea to halt and roll back its nuclear
and missile programmes. On the global front, China sought participation
in global institutions like the World Trade Organisation (WTO). **[China
is also playing a very active role [in the UN.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
According to one figure, **[China's [membership]{.mark} of international
governmental organisations [doubled (from 21 to 52]{.mark}) during the
years 1977-1997.]{.underline}** In the same time period, its membership
of International Non-Governmental Organisations (INGOs) increased from
mere 71 to an impressive 1,163.34 Similarly, according to another
account, China signed less than 30 per cent of the arms control accords
it was eligible to join in the 1970s compared to 80 per cent by
mid-1990s. 35 **[China has actively taken part in the treaties of the
nuclear non-proliferation regime as well as those of aimed at
non-proliferation of biological and chemical weapons.]{.underline}** It
has also become a part of the voluntary non-proliferation groups like
the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) in 2004 and exercises strict export
control policies. Since 2004, China has also shown interest in joining
the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). This is an indicator of
China's willingness to participate in international institutes and
regimes, increasing comfort towards norms of interdependent behaviour
among states. It has also exhibited the desire to somewhat shape the
rules of the game for regional cooperation. This is definitely an
indication of its tendency towards the status quo. It also advances
China's national interests and helps dispel concerns about its
increasing economic and military power.36 This is also an indicator that
China is willing to work in the existing Western-dominated systems of
international institution and regimes rather than challenge the system
or seek to break it up. Moreover, China consciously pursued a good
neighbour policy. The pursuit of good relations with its neighbour is
the foundation of its strategy for economic development. It has the dual
benefit of attracting foreign trade and investment while, at the same
time, it reassures its neighbours that it does not present a threat for
them. Deng Xiaoping laid two paths for China's foreign policy in 1990 ─
anti-hegemonism and establishment of a new multi-polar international
order of politics and economics. This meant that China adopted a policy
of active defence of China's interest ─ of minding its own business and
be neither a leader nor a challenger but a participant or co-builder of
the westerns international order.37 This remains the foundation of
China's foreign policy today. **[Many analysts,]{.underline}** however,
**[argue that participation in]{.underline}** the international
**[institutions is not an adequate indicator]{.underline}** but
compliance with the norms, rules and goals of these institutions is a
better indicator of whether a country is a status quo state or not.
**[Along these lines,]{.underline}** Alastair **[Johnston considers
China's compliance with]{.underline}** five **[global normative
regimes:]{.underline}** these include sovereignty, free trade,
non-proliferation and arms control, national self determination and
human rights.38 **[As far as sovereignty is concerned]{.underline}** he
writes: "Today **[China is one of the strongest defenders of a more
traditional absolutist concept]{.underline}** (of sovereignty)."39
Similarly, free trade is another international norm that is seen as an
indicator of status quo behaviour. China has moved to support the norms
of global free trade. China's **[[membership of
WTO]{.underline}]{.mark}** in 2001 **[is a testament to its support for
free trade.]{.underline}** China's **[[tariff rates have
declined]{.mark} from over 40 per cent in 1992 to less than 20 per cent
in 1997.]{.underline}**40 In 2015, the tariff rate was 3.4 per cent.41
China has gradually embraced global capitalist institutions and system.
In the Belt and Road Forum that China held in May 2017, hosting 30 world
leaders, it released a communiqué, which was signed by all 30 world
leaders present on the occasion that emphasised the need to "build an
open economy, ensure free and inclusive trade (and) oppose all forms of
protectionism."42 However, the ongoing trade war with the US has forced
China to increase its tariffs. Since 2017, the US had imposed three
rounds of tariff on the Chinese products worth US\$250 billion. China
has retaliated by imposing US\$110 billion on the US goods. Beijing has
accused the US of starting the "largest trade war in economic history."
43 This damages the global free trade regime. **[China has gone even a
step further [and]{.mark} initiated projects like the China Pakistan
Economic Corridor ([CPEC]{.mark}), which is envisaged as a journey
towards economic regionalisation.]{.underline}** The CPEC is a framework
of regional connectivity which is expected to be beneficial for China
and Pakistan as well as the regional states like India, Iran,
Afghanistan and Central Asia. Its primary aim is to promote geographical
linkages and improve infrastructure connectivity. It would also result
in a higher flow of trade and businesses in the region.44 Its ultimate
aim is to have a well-connected region, promote harmony and accelerate
economic development. This is also a **[clear indication that China is
[focus]{.mark}ed [on economic development and regionalisation instead
of]{.mark} displaying aggressive [hegemonic behaviour]{.mark}. As far as
China's non-proliferation record is concerned, it has a fair record,
with no blatant violations of international nuclear non-proliferation
norms.]{.underline}** The prevailing concerns mostly centred on the
transfer of missile technology and components to Pakistan in the 1980s
and early 1990s. However, China has not signed the 1987 MTCR, so it does
not amount to any violations of China's treaty obligations. On the
positive side, in 1996, China signed the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty
(CTBT), which a major nuclear non-proliferation proponent like the US
has not done till date.45 It has been cooperating with the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) and has installed four new
International Monitoring System (IMS) stations, bringing the total
number of certified stations in China, to five. Furthermore, it is also
a part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) since the time that
it was signed. Moreover, along with Russia, China has long been trying
to get a treaty negotiated to ban the stationing of offensive weapons in
outer-space. For nearly two decades, now there have been the Chinese and
Russian efforts to negotiate a treaty for Prevention of an Arms Race in
Outer Space (PAROS). Many proposals have been put forward including the
two Chinese working papers and a joint China-Russia working paper in the
Conference on Disarmament (CD). However, PAROS remains blocked due to
the US refusal to negotiate any such treaty because it goes against its
missile defence and space plans.46 [**[China]{.underline}**
**[has]{.underline}**]{.mark} also **[[played a stabilising role
in]{.mark} the [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rean nuclear issue. It acted as
a lynchpin in hosting and conducting the six-party [talks]{.mark}, which
were meant to solve the North Korean nuclear issue.]{.underline}** Even
after the breakdown of the six-party talks in 2009 and the recent high
tensions on the Korean Peninsula in 2017 with the US, China played the
role of a stabiliser, urging both sides to show restraint and
emphasising that war was not an option for any country. China has, thus,
helped strengthen the international nuclear non-proliferation norms.
Also, China's growing soft power47 or its "charm offensive" in Southeast
Asia and elsewhere is another indicator that it is not an aggressive,
power maximising state. Its economic progress has been accompanied by
its increasing cultural and diplomatic influence around the globe. Its
growing soft power is not only evident in Southeast Asia but also in
Beijing's economic partnerships in Latin America and Africa.48 The fact
that China is able to attract and appeal the states in the region
through its soft power is an indicator that its neighbours are
increasingly viewing China as less of a threat. However, this has
stirred the concerns of waning the US influence in the region. In many
parts of Asia, Africa and the Latin America, the "Beijing Consensus"
which advocates a mix of authoritarian government and market economy, is
overtaking the "Washington Consensus" of market economics and democratic
government which was popular in the past.49 With signs that the US is
placing emphasis on hard power under President Donald Trump, China seems
to be positioning itself as a champion of globalisation and economic
integration. It seems to be placing an emphasis on soft power.
**[Taiwan]{.underline}** issue **[is one instance where China's policies
are viewed by the West as a non-status quo. However, the issue can be
seen in terms of a security dilemma between the US and China. In the
last few decades, [America]{.mark} continued selling advanced [weapons
to Taiwan]{.mark}, mainland China considers these developments to
[encourage]{.mark} Taiwan's independence and [a threat to its
interests]{.mark}.]{.underline}** According to Yiwei Wang, "on the
Taiwan issue, **[America's logic is that peace comes from "balance of
power." China has time and again protested the matter of arms sales to
Taiwan with the US but to no avail. China sees these moves as an effort
to change the distribution of power in the region. In turn, China has
threatened Taiwan against moves for independence and deployed missiles
on the mainland as well. Consequently, this makes the US suspicious of
China's revisionist intentions towards Taiwan -- locking the two powers
in a security dilemma. Another area where China has been accused of
displaying revisionist tendencies is in [the S]{.mark}outh
[C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea.]{.underline}** The dispute centres on
territorial claims over two island chains the Paracels and the Spratlys
and surrounding oceans. The area provides valuable trade passage and
fishing ground, as well as holds hydrocarbon resources ranging from
25,000 Mboe to 260,000 Mboe.51 China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan,
Malaysia and Brunei all have competing claims. The **[dispute has
existed for centuries but things got tense in the last few
years.]{.underline}** China has been island-building since 2014 and has
also increased naval patrols. **[It can be argued that China's actions
are defensive in nature. [The US has had increased interference]{.mark}
in the area. [Under]{.mark} the garb of "[f]{.mark}reedom [o]{.mark}f
[n]{.mark}avigation" [op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}, the US sent planes
and ships in the disputed area to keep access to key shipping and air
routes]{.underline}**.52 In February 2017, the US deployed the aircraft
carrier, Carl Vinson, strike force to the South China Sea under the garb
of "freedom of navigation."53 Another week-long US and British Naval
exercise took place in January 2019.54 These are meant to send a signal
to China to rescind claims over the disputed area. **[These exercises
have angered China. [China does not have expansionist]{.mark} or
hegemonic [designs]{.mark} in the South China Sea. It claims over the
two island chains are not something new. [Beijing]{.mark} has
[adjusted]{.mark} its [strategy to safeguard]{.mark} its
[interests]{.mark}, as it becomes increasingly powerful. However, a
military conflict over the dispute is not an option. Moreover, the [US
influence]{.mark} over other claimants of the territory complicates
matters for China. This has [resulted in China acting more
assertively]{.mark} in the South China Sea in order to defend its
interests. In fact, [the US would act]{.mark} more [aggressively if any
country was to interfere in]{.mark} matters close to [its
borders.]{.mark} Overall, from the above analysis, it can be summarised
that China has so far behaved more as a status quo power rather than as
an aggressive]{.underline}** revisionist **[power.]{.underline}** This
is apparent in China's engagement with its neighbours, its participation
in the regional and international institutions, it is in compliance with
most of the international norms as well as its emphasis on projecting
its soft power. The claims of Mearsheimer's offensive realism are in
contrast with Waltz's defensive realism on several points. While
Mearsheimer claims that great powers act aggressively and aim to gain so
much power that they are the ultimate hegemons in the system, Waltz's
defensive realism sees the states as acting defensively to maintain
rather than upset the balance of power. For Waltz, the **[states are
primarily concerned with maintaining "their position in the
system."]{.underline}**55 Defensive realists argue that
**[offence-defence balance favours the defence.]{.underline}** 56
**[Therefore, a robust defence and careful balancing should deter any
aggressive impulses from great powers.]{.underline}** Defensive realism
argues that great powers are concerned with maintaining the status quo
rather than maximising their power because often the **[cost of
expansion outweighs the benefits.]{.underline}** Defensive realism sees
security dilemmas as a problem where an increase in the power of one
state increases the insecurity of the other causing the latter to
increase its power. Under the conditions of defensive realism, great
powers would try to alleviate any security dilemmas rather than
exacerbate it. China's current policy seems to be firmly rooted in
defensive realism. Its policy seems to be aimed at maintaining the
balance of power rather than upsetting it. As the earlier section has
argued, China is not a revisionist power but a status quo one. The
analysts like Shiping Tang are convinced that China's security strategy
flows out of its realisation of the security dilemma whereby the
**[Chinese leaders have understood that an aggressive expansionist
strategy would just lead to counterbalancing alliances.]{.underline}**
"This recognition has led China to adopt a defensive realism-rooted
security strategy emphasising moderation, self-restraint and security
cooperation."57 Moreover, China's military modernisation, its Taiwan
policy and its increased policies in the South China Sea also make more
sense if seen through the lens of defensive realism. China's Taiwan
policy may be more geared towards preventing redistribution of power in
the region. Since the US is providing arms assistance to Taiwan, China
may be averse to the US aiding Taiwan's independence ─ the latter issue
is one where China has made clear that independence is not acceptable to
China. Similarly, there is good evidence that China's military
modernisation programmes and training exercises since the Taiwan Strait
Crisis of 1996 are aimed partially at dealing with the issue of the
Taiwanese separation.58 On the question of whether China is balancing
against the US, Johnston says, "There seems to be little doubt that
China's military modernisation programme since the mid-1990s has been
aimed in large measure at developing capabilities to deter or slow the
application of the US military power in the region."59 It would then
seem that China is not concerned with gaining power or projecting its
powers but with balancing against a predominance of the US power in the
region. **[China has not shown any signs of hegemonic behaviour as a lot
of Western analysts feared]{.underline}**. Instead of guided by
offensive realism, China's policies seem to be guided by defensive
realism where it is concerned with survival and with maintaining its
position in the system. Just as the US fears China's hegemonic rise,
China also fears the increase of the US influence in the region and its
talk of containing China. China's policy may change in the future to
display hegemonic tendencies. However, at present, **[[there is
not]{.mark} much [evidence to support]{.mark} the theory of [offensive
realism.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### No Iran War

#### No Iran wars.

**Pollack 19** -- Kenneth M. Pollack, a former CIA intelligence analyst
and expert on Middle East politics and military affairs, a resident
scholar at the American Enterprise Institute focusing on Middle Eastern
political-military affairs, former Senior Fellow at the Saban Center for
Middle East Policy, and former and a Senior Advisor at Albright
Stonebridge Group. \[Is war with Iran imminent? Here\'s the real truth,
5-16-2019,
http://www.aei.org/publication/is-war-with-iran-imminent-heres-the-real-truth/\]

**[[Is the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[going to war]{.mark} with
[Iran?]{.mark} Probably [no]{.mark}t]{.underline}**.

Should the United States go to war with Iran? Probably not.

Now that that's out of the way, we can unpack the current tensions with
Iran, where they are likely to lead, and the potential pitfalls the
United States should avoid on the road ahead.

**[It is unlikely]{.underline}** that we **[will]{.underline}** find
ourselves in a **[war]{.underline}** with **[Iran]{.underline}** in the
near term because **[[both sides are eager to avoid
one]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although some of President Trump's advisors
may welcome a clash with Tehran, he has consistently made clear that he
wants to end American wars in the Middle East, not start new ones. That
has been behind his impetus to pull US troops out of Syria and his
unwillingness to become further involved in the Yemeni civil war.

On the other side of the Persian Gulf, **[[Ayatollah]{.mark} Ali
Khamene'i, Iran's Supreme Leader [announced]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
**[there would be [no war]{.mark}. In case you don't believe him, the
[Iran]{.mark}ians]{.underline}** have typically
**[[show]{.underline}]{.mark}**n **[[enormous respect for
American]{.mark} conventional military [power since they were
shellacked]{.mark} by it [in the]{.mark} late 19[80s. They
know]{.mark}]{.underline}** full well that in a full-on war, **[the [US
would]{.mark}]{.underline}** do tremendous damage to Iran's armed forces
and could **[[threaten the regime's]{.underline}]{.mark}** grip on
**[[power]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- which is the very thing they are
seeking to avoid.

Of course, just because two countries don't want a war doesn't mean that
they won't stumble into one anyway. Given the current tensions created
by the American pressure on Iran and Tehran's nascent efforts to push
back, the deployment of additional American military forces to the
region, and the tendency for Iran's Revolutionary Guards to occasionally
take unauthorized aggressive actions, no one should rule out **[an
unintended [clash]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Even then, however, the most
likely scenario **[[would be a limited]{.mark} American [retaliatory
strike to demonstrate]{.mark}]{.underline}** to Iran that **[[Washington
won't be pushed around by a]{.mark} 98-pound [weakling]{.mark} and that
Tehran needs to keep its problem children under control]{.underline}**.

#### Deterrence and conflict aversion [both outweigh]{.underline} miscalc.

Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, & Elizabeth N. Saunders,

probably less likely than you think, the Washington Post, 6-17-19,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/17/war-with-iran-is-probably-less-likely-than-you-think/\]

**[Misperception rarely causes war]{.underline}**. The spiral model may
not be the right way to think about how conflicts escalate. Missed
signals and miscalculation can indeed generate tension. But
**[[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}** have many ways to **[[avoid
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}** that they do not want to fight. **[The
historical [record suggests]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
**[[misperception and accident]{.mark}al escalation [rarely lead to
war]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- as Dan Reiter noted here at TMC during
the height of North Korea tensions in 2018. Domestic political pressures
don't seem to be pushing toward war. **[The
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[and
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[face]{.mark} domestic
[pressures]{.mark} that]{.underline}** may **[make [both sides
hesitate]{.mark} before escalating. [Iran's]{.mark}
economy]{.underline}** has **[[suffered under]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
Trump administration's renewed **[[sanctions]{.mark}, and]{.underline}**
parliamentary **[[elections are coming]{.mark} up]{.underline}**.
Although the country's president, Hassan Rouhani, has used tough
rhetoric recently, **[a costly [war]{.mark}]{.underline}** might not
benefit Iran's leaders, since it **[[could inflict]{.mark} further
[economic]{.mark} and human [costs, or]{.mark}]{.underline}** even lead
to **[[regime]{.mark} change or [collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Likewise, **[[after]{.underline}]{.mark}** nearly **[[two
decades]{.underline}]{.mark}** of war **[[in the Middle
East]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Afghanistan, **[[Americans are unlikely
to welcome a]{.mark}nother major [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Neither Trump's own party nor the opposition Democrats has rallied the
U.S. public to pressure Trump to escalate. As TMC's Michael Tesler noted
in December, **[although Trump's base]{.underline}** supporters tend to
**[have hawkish views, they supported his decision to
withdraw]{.underline}** troops **[from Syria. If Trump does not want
war]{.underline}** with Iran, **[his base would]{.underline}** likely
**[follow]{.underline}**. The president doesn't seem eager for war.
There has been much talk about a replay of the Iraq War, with the United
States using possibly flawed intelligence to justify war. But although
**[Trump]{.underline}** has used limited military force in Syria, he
**[seems generally opposed to costly wars in the Middle
East]{.underline}**, and unlikely to embrace a new one. Both Pompeo and
national security adviser John Bolton are much more hawkish on Iran, but
**[Trump]{.underline}** has **[distanced]{.underline}** himself
**[from]{.underline}** his **[advisers' hawkish rhetoric]{.underline}**,
particularly the most costly option: regime change. \[Designating an
Iranian military unit a terrorist organization will make relations with
Iran more difficult. Here\'s how.\] Here's what to watch for. So which
will win out: the risks of escalation or the pressures for restraint?
Amid all the tension, **[[Iran wants]{.mark} its regime [to
survive]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and **[Trump]{.underline}** probably
**[does not want to absorb a costly war]{.underline}**. In the coming
days and weeks, it will be telling to see if there is further daylight
between Trump and his advisers. Here's one more risk: if Trump's hawkish
advisers present an option that seems like it could be kept limited, but
actually carries a strong likelihood of escalation. Trump has embraced
limited displays of force, such as airstrikes in Syria in 2017 and 2018,
and he issued a threatening tweet on Iran in May. But he has also
pivoted away quickly from harsh rhetoric to diplomacy before --- as he
did toward North Korea --- and has already achieved his campaign goal of
pulling out of the nuclear deal he disdained. \[Would Iran welcome a new
nuclear deal? Think again.\] The bottom line: **[Despite rising tension,
powerful factors reduce]{.underline}** the likelihood of
**[war]{.underline}** between the U.S. and Iran. **[That's unlikely to
change]{.underline}** anytime soon.

#### The threat is [predictable]{.underline}, which [minimizes]{.underline} the chance of war.

Once again it seems to me that the appropriate response is "maybe, but
maybe not." **[Though climate change can cause plenty of
misery]{.underline}**... **[it will not necessarily lead to armed
conflict.]{.underline}** The **[political scientists]{.underline}** who
track war and peace, **[such as]{.underline}** Halvard
**[Buhaug]{.underline}**, Idean **[Salehyan]{.underline}**, Ole
**[Theisen]{.underline}**, and Nils **[Gleditsch]{.underline}**, **[are
skeptical of the popular idea that people fight wars over scarce
resources]{.underline}**. **[[Hunger and]{.mark} resource
[shortages]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[are]{.mark} tragically
[common]{.mark} in sub-Saharan countries such as]{.underline}**
**[Malawi]{.underline}**, **[Zambia]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** **[Tanzania]{.underline}**, **[but [wars involving
them are not.]{.mark} Hurricanes, floods, droughts, and
tsunamis]{.underline}** (such as the disastrous one in the Indian Ocean
in 2004) **[do not generally lead to conflict.]{.underline}**
**[The]{.underline}** American **[dust bowl in]{.underline}** the 1930s,
to take another example, **[caused plenty of deprivation but no civil
war]{.underline}**. And **[while temperatures have been rising steadily
in Africa during the past fifteen years]{.underline}**, **[civil wars
and war deaths have been falling. Pressures on access to
land]{.underline}** and water **[[can]{.mark} certainly [cause]{.mark}
local [skirmishes]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[but]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[a genuine [war requires]{.mark} that [hostile forces]{.mark} be

connection to terrorism is in the imagination of the terror warriors:
terrorists tend to be underemployed lower-middle-class men, not
subsistence farmers. As for genocide, the Sudanese government finds it
convenient to blame violence in Darfur on desertification, distracting
the world from its own role in tolerating or encouraging the ethnic
cleansing. **[[In a regression]{.mark} analysis on armed conflicts from
1980 to 1992]{.underline}**, **[Theisen found that [conflict was]{.mark}
more [likely if a country was poor]{.mark}]{.underline}**,

#### The countries that matter will solve escalation with institutions.

However, [current [research **does not**]{.mark}]{.underline} yet
[indicate a clear [link]{.mark} between]{.underline} climate change,
[[food insecurity and conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}, except perhaps
where rapidly deteriorating water availability cuts across existing
tensions and weak institutions. But a series of interlinked problems --
changing global patterns of consumption of energy and scarce resources,
increasing demands for food imports (which draw on land, water, and
energy inputs) can create pressure on fragile situations. [Food security
-- and food prices -- are a highly political issue]{.underline}, being a
very immediate and visible source of popular welfare or popular
uncertainty. [But their **link to conflict**]{.underline} (and the wider
links between climate change and conflict) [is indirect]{.underline}
rather than direct. What makes some countries more resilient than
others? [**[Many]{.mark}** countries [face food price]{.mark} or natural
resource [shocks **without**]{.mark} **falling into
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Essentially, the two important
[factors]{.underline} in [determining their resilience are]{.underline}:
First, [whether food insecurity is combined with **other
stresses**]{.underline} -- issues such as unemployment, but most
fundamentally issues such as political exclusion or human rights abuses.
[We sometimes read]{.underline} nowadays that the 2006-2009 [drought was
a factor in the Syrian conflict,]{.underline} by driving rural-urban
migration that caused societal stresses. It may of course have been one
factor amongst many but [[it would be **too simplistic** to
suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[it was]{.mark} the [primary]{.mark}
driver]{.underline} of the Syrian conflict. Second, [whether countries
have strong enough [institutions]{.mark}]{.underline} to fulfill a
social compact with their citizens, [providing [help]{.mark} quickly to
[citizens affected]{.mark} by food insecurity]{.underline}, with or
without international assistance. [During the]{.underline} 2007-20[08
food crisis, developing countries with low institutional strength
experienced more food price protests]{.underline} than those with higher
institutional strengths, and more than half these protests turned
violent. [This]{.underline} for example, [is the difference in the
events in Haiti versus]{.underline} those [**[in Mexico or the
Philippines]{.mark}** where far greater [institutional strength]{.mark}
existed to [deal with]{.mark} the food price [shocks and **protests did
not**]{.mark} **spur [deteriorat]{.mark}ing [national security]{.mark}**
or widespread violence]{.underline}.

#### No correlation between food shortages and conflict---other factors

**Buhaug et al 15** \[Halvard Buhaug, Peace Research Institute in Oslo

production shocks, and violent conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa"

**[Across all models, [we find]{.mark} relatively weak and
[insignificant effects for]{.mark} domestic [food
production]{.mark}]{.underline}** and we also note that the sign of the
coefficients shifts between outcome types. In this sense, table 1
implicitly contrasts both claims that political violence is more
prevalent when basic needs are met (Salehyan and Hendrix 2014) and
claims that agricultural income shocks increase civil conflict risk (von
Uexkull 2014). **[The results are consistent with Koub]{.underline}**i
et al (2012) **[and van Weezel]{.underline}** (2015), however, **[who
conclude that rainfall]{.underline}**---a significant determinant of
yields in SSA---**[has little impact on conflict]{.underline}** either
directly or through economic performance.

The covariate that best and most consistently explains temporal
variation in political violence is the time-lagged conflict incidence
indicator. Models 1--2 show that a new civil conflict is unlikely to
break out if another one is already ongoing in the same country whereas
Models 3--6, which capture the occurrence of less organized conflict,
demonstrate that violence begets violence. Coups d\'état (Models 7--8)
exhibit a comparatively weak temporal correlation pattern in our data
and are generally regarded as a highly unpredictable phenomenon (Luttwak
1979).

Next, **[we estimate the same set of models on]{.underline}** a
subsample of 14 **[countries in SSA where rainfall has a large and
significant positive effect on food production]{.underline}** (figure
2(b); see supplementary information, section B for details). To better
capture the influence of climate variability and reduce concerns with
endogeneity, we further replace the standard OLS model with two-stage
instrumental variable regression. The first stage in this model
estimates the joint influence of annual rainfall (linear and squared
terms) and temperature (linear) on contemporaneous food production. This
effect then constitutes the exogenous instrument for food production in
the second stage. The results are reported in table 2. Mirroring the
results presented above, **[we fail to uncover a robust signal for
agricultural performance]{.underline}**, although the sign of the
coefficient for food production now remains negative in seven of the
eight specifications.

Food production shocks may have different consequences depending on the
socioeconomic context, so next we consider a series of interactive
relationships. Specifically, we investigate the joint effect of food
production and (i) low level of development, (ii) extent of
discriminatory political system, and (iii) economic dependence on
agriculture; three conditions whereby loss of income from agriculture
might constitute a particular challenge to society. To model these
interactions, we include time-varying regressors instead of
country-fixed effects where (i) is represented by infant mortality rate
(IMR; World Bank 2014), (ii) is captured using the Ethnic Power
Relations v.1.1 data (Cederman et al 2010), while (iii) uses an index of
agricultural contribution to GDP (World Bank 2014). Moreover, to
preserve focus on temporal dynamics, food production is now
operationalized as yearly deviation from the country mean, 1961--2009.
We use additive inverse deviation values to ensure theoretical
consistency among the components in the interaction terms. **[All models
control for]{.underline}** (ln) **[population]{.underline}** size,
**[conflict history]{.underline}**, and a **[common time
trend]{.underline}**, **[and models without IMR and agricultural
dependence additionally control for]{.underline}** (ln) **[GDP per
capita]{.underline}**. The results are presented in table 3.

Again, **[[we are unsuccessful in establishing]{.mark} a consistent
[covariation pattern between ag]{.mark}ricultural [performance and
political violence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Interpreting the combined
effect of interaction terms with continuous parameters is inherently
difficult but figure 4 shows that food production is insignificantly
related to all conflict outcomes across levels of socioeconomic
development for all three interaction terms. The sole exception is the
result in Model 24, where lower food production in highly discriminatory
societies is negatively associated with non-state conflict.
**[[This]{.mark} result [would]{.mark} seem to [contradict the]{.mark}
standard [scarcity thesis]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}(Homer-Dixon
1999) although it is consistent with observations that conflict is more
prevalent during surplus years (Witsenburg and Adano 2009, Salehyan and
Hendrix 2014).

Mirroring earlier research, ethnopolitical exclusion is strongly related
to higher civil conflict risk, but not necessarily to other forms of
political violence. Infant mortality rate and economic dependence on
agriculture appear largely irrelevant. While this may come as a
surprise, recall that most countries in SSA are characterized by
underdevelopment and a large agricultural sector, implying that the
variation in values on these indicators is modest.

Large parameter uncertainties and p-values above the conventional
significance threshold (5%) may disguise substantively important effects
(Ward et al 2010). Accordingly, as a final assessment, we conduct a set
of out-of-sample simulations and compare predictions for models with and
without food production. The models are estimated on a subset of the
full sample, in this case all years before 2000, and the estimated
effects are then used to predict conflict outcomes out of sample, i.e.,
the 2000--09 period. Figure 5 shows the predicted values from four pairs
of models that are specified similarly to Models 17, 20, 23, and 26,
except for the shorter time period and the fact that one model in each
pair drops the food production deviation variable. **[For civil conflict
and social unrest, the models generate very similar predictions,
signaling that agricultural performance adds little to the models\'
predictive power]{.underline}**. There is more spread in the predictions
for the remaining two outcome categories. **[Puzzlingly]{.underline}**,
**[[the model without food production performs better]{.mark} in both
cases]{.underline}**---i.e., the Receiver Operating Characteristics
curves have higher \'Area Under the Curve\' scores. We hesitate to put
too much emphasis on the ROC tests, given the rareness of the outcomes
(notably Models 17 and 26) and the relatively small training samples
(Models 20 and 23), but nonetheless the patterns observed in the
out-of-sample simulations substantiate the regression results reported
above; fluctuations in agricultural output explain little of the
observed variation in political violence in post-colonial Sub-Saharan
Africa.

5\. Concluding remarks

Emerging **[[evidence]{.mark} suggests [that]{.mark} food [price shocks
are associated]{.mark} with an increase in social
[unrest]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Smith 2014, Bellemare 2015, Hendrix and
Haggard 2015, Weinberg and Bakker 2015). Yet, the robust \'non-finding\'
presented here implies that so-called \'food riots\' play out largely
isolated from climate-sensitive production dynamics in the affected
countries. Likewise, **[claims that]{.underline}** adverse weather and
**[harvest failure drive]{.underline}** contemporary
**[violence]{.underline}** in Africa (e.g., Hsiang et al 2013, IFPRI
2015) **[[are not supported]{.mark} by our analysis]{.underline}**.
**[Instead]{.underline}**, **[social protest and rebellion during times
of food price spikes]{.underline}** **[may be better understood as
reactions to poor and unjust government policies]{.underline}**,
corruption, repression, and market failure (e.g., Bush 2010, Buhaug and
Urdal 2013, Sneyd et al 2013, Chenoweth and Ulfelder 2015).

#### Food prices don't cause conflict\-\--reject their bad studies. 

**Demarest 15**---PhD Researcher at the Centre for Research on Peace and
Development \[Leila, "Food price rises and political instability:

Development Research, Vol. 27, No. 5, p. 650-671, Emory Libraries\]

**[6. Conclusions and Way Forward]{.underline}**

While some progress has been made in improving our understanding of the
linkages between rising food prices and conflict, several **[important
gaps remain]{.underline}**. Firstly, notions of **[conflict and
political instability are]{.underline}** often **[used
interchangeably]{.underline}**, while these concepts and the
relationships between them remain to some extent vague. **[[The 'food
riot' concept]{.underline}]{.mark}** in particular **[[leads to
confusion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although it is popularly seen as a
violent rise of the masses, in reality, **[many [peaceful events are
gathered under this term]{.mark}, while violence is]{.underline}** often
**[committed by the state rather than by hungry
consumers]{.underline}**. **[The term]{.underline}** also **[presupposes
that food is the central issue at hand, which does not]{.underline}**
necessarily **[have to be the case]{.underline}**. **[[Many
misunderstanding arise from]{.mark} the]{.underline}** second gap
identified in this paper: the **[[uncritical data gathering]{.mark}
based on international news reports]{.underline}**. **[[Not only are
these remarkably inconsistent, they]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[make
[use]{.mark} of [classifications which are not scientifically
investigated]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Finally, **[[causal
mechanisms]{.mark} in the relationship [between]{.mark} rising [food
prices and conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}** often remain assumptions in
the literature and **[[lack empirical foundation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Three crosscutting avenues for improvement therefore exist: better
concept definitions, better data gathering, and more focus on contexts.

Clearly defined concepts and categorizations of conflict and instability
are a necessary foundation for research on the linkages between rising
food prices and conflict. For (food) protests in particular, purposeful
categorizations require an enhanced insight in the events that took
place on the ground. Local news sources for data gathering can prove to
be more reliable than Western (English) media to accomplish this. Event
descriptions are also likely to be more detailed in local sources, which
allows for a first-hand qualitative analysis of causes and context.

As international food prices are likely to remain high, improving our
understanding of the causal mechanisms which can lead to conflict
remains crucial. We can draw important lessons from the literature on
poverty and conflict, resource scarcity and conflict, and regime
transition in Africa. **[The causal role of economic factors alone has
continuously been questioned, and 'context' or prevailing political,
economic, and social factors play a crucial role in the conflict
outcome]{.underline}**. The argument that **[adverse economic shocks
seem more of a trigger to conflict]{.underline}** rather than an
important cause is not particularly remarkable in itself. **[Yet while
many authors acknowledge this, the focus often remains on the
trigger]{.underline}**. Resource scarcity, climate change, population
growth, or food insecurity often remain the starting point of analyses,
with researchers consequently tracing the divergent (theoretical)
possibilities for conflict. **[In the end, [most admit that these
factors do not]{.mark} automatically [lead to conflict]{.mark}
everywhere, and stress the importance of context]{.underline}**. Because
the theoretical possibilities for conflict are so large, however, the
context factor remains rather understudied with as most agreed upon
notions that elements of 'grievance' and 'collective action' are
required.

It is hence important to focus more on the 'contexts' that can lead to
conflict and, in doing so, to make the distinction between different
forms of conflict. This also implies a data collection exercise.
**[[Contextual data]{.mark} are currently collected at the aggregate,
national level, and only on a yearly basis, which can [lead to spurious
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While the use of these variables is
increasingly questioned in civil war studies,
**[[we]{.underline}]{.mark}** can also **[[doubt their strength in the
study]{.mark} of highly localized, [one-time events such as
riots]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I particularly make the case for 'bringing
politics back in'. The policies taken by the government are crucial in
the violent escalation of social conflict (e.g. accommodation versus
repression), but the only variable currently in use to explain state
behaviour seems to be the country-level regime type variable (Polity IV
or Freedom House), which is also used with regards to highly localized
conflicts. Other ways in which politics matter, can be the strength of
the political opposition. The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, for example,
was probably better organized than other opposition groups to make use
of economic unrest.

08-11-2020. <https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3096978/south-china-sea-chinese-military-told-not-fire-first-shot>

**[China has told]{.underline}** its service **[personnel "not to fire
the first shot" as Beijing looks to de-escalate]{.underline}** tensions
with the United States in **[the
S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea,
sources familiar with the situation told the South China Morning
Post. **[Both sides have stepped
up ]{.underline}**their **[operations]{.underline}** in the disputed
waters, increasing the risk of incidents that spiral out of
control, **[but Beijing does not want to give American hawks the
opportunity to escalate things further]{.underline}**. The sources
said **[Beijing]{.underline}** had **[ordered pilots and naval officers
to exercise restraint]{.underline}** in the increasingly frequent
stand-offs with US planes and warships. Meanwhile, further details have
emerged about a phone conversation between the two countries' defence
ministers last week. The call was first suggested by the US side about
"a month earlier" but was initially given a frosty reception in Beijing.
But a source said the Chinese **[leadership]{.underline}** later
had **[a change of heart and decided to reach out as tensions
escalated]{.underline}** in the South and East China seas. Last month,
the US deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups, the USS Nimitz and
USS Ronald Reagan, for drills near Chinese waters and has also carried
out rare nighttime aerial reconnaissance missions close to Guangdong and
Fujian provinces in recent weeks. China has also conducted naval drills
and flyover missions around Taiwan and the South China Sea. **[Despite
tough public language]{.underline}** dismissing the US carrier strike
groups as "paper tigers", sources said **[the PLA was wary of accidental
clashes]{.underline}**. One source close to the military also said
Beijing had communicated through "various channels" to the US that it
had told its military "never to fire first" in a goodwill gesture to
keep the situation under control. "It's easy to give the order to shoot,
but neither China nor the US is able to control the consequences. The
current situation is highly tense and very dangerous," the person said.
He said the PLA was a "different military force" from 2001 -- a
reference to the Hainan incident when a US intelligence aircraft
collided with a PLA fighter jet. The Chinese pilot Wang Wei was killed
and the US plane was forced to land on Hainan island. The crewmen were
eventually released after the US issued a carefully worded statement on
the incident. "Today, the PLA has developed many countermeasures. The
Americans won't be able to return in one piece if such an accident ever
happens again," he said. "But we are very clear that we will respond
with force only as the last resort, when everything else has failed."
Another source said the two sides had established protocols to handle
military encounters but these arrangements needed to be updated to
reflect the latest situation. The source did not elaborate on whether
this was discussed by the two defence ministers, Mark Esper and Wei
Fenghe, in their August 6 conversation. China and the US established the
military maritime consultative agreement in 1998 to avoid accidents
during close encounters. In 2014 they agreed on an initiative to notify
each other of major military operations and a code of conduct for naval
and military encounters. But in recent years the relationship between
the two countries has steadily worsened. US Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo has become increasingly belligerent in his rhetoric against
China, taking aim directly at the Communist Party and declaring that the
policy of engagement with China was "a failure". Apart from increasing
its operations in the South China Sea, the US has also rejected China's
sweeping claims in the disputed waters, saying they were "unlawful" and
threatened the freedom of navigation. Meanwhile, the
Chinese **[leadership has become increasingly concerned about security,
with]{.underline}** President **[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping **[telling
the Politburo]{.underline}** late last month **[that
"uncertain]{.underline}** and unstable **[factors" were an increasing
threat]{.underline}**. But in recent weeks, senior Chinese diplomats
have subtly changed their combative tone and called for dialogue to
contain risks. **[Foreign Minister]{.underline}** Wang Yi **[also picked
up a more conciliatory approach ]{.underline}**when discussing the South
China Sea in an interview with the state news agency Xinhua last
week. **[Wang did not mention the "nine-dash line"]{.underline}**, which
marks out China's claims over 90 per cent of the disputed waters.
Instead he said the South China Sea wass "the shared home for the
countries in the region" but should not be "a wrestling ground for
international politics". But Wang said the US had breached its
commitment not to take sides in Beijing's dispute with the other South
China Sea claimants and accused it of seeking to drive a wedge between
China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. On Monday the
foreign ministry in Beijing called for "candid and effective dialogue"
to control conflicts, but said it would firmly defend the nation's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Studies at MIPT; 8-21-2003, "Preventing Submarine Collisions: Answers to
the questions of U.S. nationwide policy debaters,".
https://www.armscontrol.ru/subs/collisions/debates.htm\]

Part 1. Q: A team from Lexington High School in Massachusetts proposes
that: \"The U.S. should establish a blueprint amending current Navy
protocols to preclude the tracking of Russian submarines in Russian
territorial waters and necessary patrol routes.\" They cite your
article, Collision of Two U.S. Nuclear Powered Submarines on March 1998,
Our Comment as evidence supporting the passage of their policy proposal.
They claim that tracking risks reactor accidents below the water and
crisis escalation when a Russian sub commander launches a SLBM in
response to U.S. sub bumping. **[What are the chances of a nuclear
accident as a result from a crash?]{.underline}** The danger of a
collision is conventional explosion which results in break up of
submarine nuclear reactors, and possibly nuclear warheads of the
missiles, so that highly radioactive nuclear materials (nuclear weapons
and nuclear fuel in submarine reactors) will be released and spread over
the wide area - pretty much like what happened in Chernobyl. If there
will be a strong wind toward the coast, the radioactive waste can spread
deep inside the territory as well. Submarine collisions are dangerous,
because they may also lead to loss of personnel and submarines. For
example, in March 1993 a U.S. submarine collided with a Delta IV Class
Russian submarine at the Barents Sea causing very heavy damage to the
front area of the Russian submarine\'s hull, and also considerable
damage to the front of the U.S. submarine as well (the SSN Grayling).
Since the Russian missile carrying submarine was moving forward in the
water when the collision occurred, had the collision happened ten to
twenty seconds later, it could have resulted in the crushing of one or
more of the submarine\'s missile compartments. Such a collision could
have caused a deflagration event that could have resulted in the loss of
the Russian submarine, and possibly the U.S. submarine as well. Q: Also
would a nuclear accident, perhaps 3-4 nuclear accidents lead to the
extinction of all life in the oceans? It seems a little crazy that this
could happen but the way that **[most teams are winning is by claiming
[a crash could end all]{.mark} aquatic [life]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[This statement [is]{.mark} a little bit
[exaggerated]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Atomic bombs destroyed both
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killed more than 200,000 people, but there was
also many people who survived. Chernobyl accident inflicted a severe
damage, however **[the whole life did not end]{.underline}**. The danger
of an accident involving nuclear materials is that it effects a very
large territory and rehabilitation of the damaged territory will take
hundreds years. Nuclear submarine accidents may result in release of
highly radioactive and toxic materials, which are dangerous to both
humans and marine life. Some species may not be preserved. There is an
extensive literature on biological effects of radioactivity. You may
find appropriate information in \"The Effects of Nuclear Weapons\" by
Glasstone or in \"Environmental Impact Statements on Disposal of Nuclear
Submarines\", produced by the U.S. Navy. Q: Has there ever been a sub
accident that resulted in radioactive material spilling into the ocean?
Fortunately, **[submarine [reactors were shut down in all]{.mark} known
[accidents]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There was some release of
radioactivity and presumably highly radioactive wastes (like water in
the coolant system). The sank submarines contained nuclear weapons on
board that might have been damaged. For example, there were reports
about damage of casings of plutonium tipped torpedoes aboard Soviet Mike
class SSN which sank in 1989 in Norwegian Sea. Plutonium leakage is now
an issue of great concern of environmentalists. Q: The Chicago Tribune
from June 23, 1997 reports that a 1986 collision off of Bermuda either
directly or indirectly caused the inadvertent launch of a Soviet nuclear
missile\... In fact there was explosion, not an inadvertent launch of a
SS-N-6 missile. The fact of collision has not been proven, however there
is an evidence, which supports such a hypothesis. Q:\..., but the book
\"Hostile Waters\" says that they just blew the missile hatch\... The
book is more reliable, because one of its authors was aboard the Yankee
SSBN which sank. Q:\...**[Is there a risk that submarine collisions

required in order for an Russian nuclear sub commander to launch his
missiles? On american subs it requires the captains and the executive
officers keys to unlock the firing button. What is it on Russian subs?
It is impossible to give a correct answer to this question, because this
is a classified information. I have seen speculations on the matter in
open literature, which look quite plausible. For example, you may find
some information in books written by Bruce Blair: \"Global Zero Alert
for Nuclear Forces\" and \"Logic of Accidental Nuclear War\". **[What is

that crashes have decreased since the end of the Cold War. If you speak
about collisions between U.S. and Russian subs, in fact, the most recent
events happened in 1992 and 1993, after the end of the Cold War.
**[[Open sources list]{.mark} approximately [a dozen]{.mark} of
sub-to-sub [collisions]{.mark}]{.underline}** in total **[[since]{.mark}

of Russian submarines drastically decreased, which diminishes
probability of a collision. However, Russian subs became less noisy, and
this fact has an adverse effect on the chances to collide with U.S. subs
attempting to trail.

As we are all well aware, the original Cold War, which officially ended
30 years ago last month, featured a number of close calls that almost
turned it into a hot war. Thankfully, neither the Cuban Missile Crisis
of 1962 nor the Able Archer exercise of 1983 (nor any other perilous
incidents), led to a war between Washington and Moscow. More recently,
however, respected statesmen have again begun to sound alarms. "Not
since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis has the risk of a U.S.-Russian
confrontation involving the use of nuclear weapons been as high as it is
today," former U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and former U.S. Sen.
Sam Nunn warned in a recent article in Foreign Affairs. I have expressed
some doubts about this proposition, but it is nevertheless worth asking
**[what]{.underline}** it is---other than the fear of mutually assured
destruction---that **[keeps the U.S. and Russia from stumbling into a
war]{.underline}** today or tomorrow. Part of the answer lies in the
**[bilateral and multilateral agreements]{.underline}** specifically
designed to **[prevent incidents that could escalate into a
war]{.underline}**. As is clear from the list below, **[there
are]{.underline}** at least half **[a dozen bilateral agreements between
Moscow and Washington]{.underline}** that have been concluded for the
purposes of **[preventing dangerous military incidents]{.underline}**.
These deals include the 1972 U.S.-Soviet agreement on prevention of
incidents on and over the high seas and the 1989 U.S.-Soviet agreement
on prevention of dangerous military activities. Some other NATO
members---including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Norway,
Spain, the Netherlands, Canada, Greece and Portugal---have agreements
with Russia on prevention of incidents on the high seas that are similar
to the 1972 agreement between Moscow and Washington, while Canada and
Greece also have agreements with Russia on prevention of dangerous
military activities. However, almost a dozen NATO members have no such
agreements with Russia, even though they abut seas. These countries
include Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and
Slovenia. Nor are there any multilateral NATO-Russia (or NATO-Collective
Security Treaty Organization) agreements on prevention of dangerous
military incidents, though a NATO-Russia Memorandum of Understanding on
avoiding and managing such incidents has been discussed in Track II. The
U.S. and its NATO allies should consider forming a unified position and
approach Russia about formal negotiations on how some of the existing
U.S.-Russian agreements on avoiding incidents could be multilaterized,
shifting from a bilateral format to a multilateral NATO-Russia format.
In particular, NATO and Russia should also discuss multilaterizing the
1989 U.S.-Soviet agreement on prevention of dangerous military
activities. NATO and Russia could discuss including concrete mechanisms
on actual prevention of incidents in such existing multilateral
agreements as the 2011 Vienna Document and the Convention on
International Civil Aviation, including, perhaps, a requirement for
warplanes to fly with their transponders turned on at all times while in
international airspace.1 The U.S. and its NATO allies should also, of
course, discuss how to save the Open Skies Treaty of 1992. In addition
to enhancing the legal framework for prevention of incidents, Russian
and Western leaders should also make sure their military commanders do
not take unauthorized actions that increase the risk of an accident that
could unintentionally lead to a conflict. There have been quite a few
instances when the U.S. and Russian militaries have accused each other
of unsafe behavior during one and the same encounter. For instance, in
June 2019 the U.S. Navy accused the Russian Navy's Admiral Vinogradov
anti-submarine destroyer of "maneuver\[ing\] from behind and to the
right of \[U.S. missile cruiser\] Chancellorsville, accelerat\[ing\] and
clos\[ing\] to an unsafe distance\" as the U.S. warship was recovering a
helicopter within 50 meters of the Russian ship in the Philippine Sea.
The Russian Navy in turn accused the Chancellorsville of unsafe
maneuvers, saying this cruiser crossed the Russian destroyer's path and
then abruptly changed direction. Earlier, Russian President Vladimir
Putin had commented on risk-taking by his senior military officials
after Russia's taking of Crimea: In a documentary-style film about those
events, which aired on Russian state television in March 2015, the then
commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, Alexander Vitko, describes how a
Su-24 attack plane was sent to fly low over the deck of the USS Donald
Cook in April 2014: "It was decided to show use and resolve to use
force." When the documentary's creator Andrei Kondrashov asks Putin to
comment, the Russian president says: "It was not my decision. It was
hooliganism on their \[the commanders'\] part and they didn't even tell
me anything about it." Last but not least, the sides should discuss how
to prevent incidents in one domain that did not exist during the
original Cold War. That domain is cyber and it is essential that the
U.S. and Russia, which both now have cyber troops, and their allies
discuss how to prevent incidents in that domain that could ultimately
lead to an accidental war. In doing so they could take a cue from
various sources, among them the aforementioned U.S.-Soviet agreement on
prevention of dangerous military activities of 1989, which warns against
"interfering with command and control networks in a manner which could
cause harm to personnel or damage to equipment of the armed forces of
the other Party." **[A new Cold War may indeed be
inevitable]{.underline}**. Some say it has already started. **[However,
that]{.underline}** doesn't mean **[the U.S., its allies and
Russia]{.underline}** cannot **[jointly work to reduce

#### No U.S.-Russia accidents 

Mel **Deaile and** Al **Mauroni, 15** Dr. Mel Deaile and Al Mauroni work
at the U.S. Air Force Center for Unconventional Weapons Studies, \"The
Need for Nuclear Alerts\",
warontherocks.com/2015/05/the-need-for-nuclear-alerts/

The Global Zero report states that the risk of the outbreak of nuclear
conflict has not decreased proportionally with the significant
reductions of nuclear weapons since the height of the Cold War. They
insist that a "hair-trigger" alert could result in a nuclear exchange
during this period of high acrimony on the international stage. By doing
so, they ignore geopolitical context. [While tensions between
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
Russia are]{.underline} undoubtedly [higher than we'd like]{.underline},
**[[we are not facing anything approaching the]{.mark} massive
competition for global dominance]{.underline}** **[that was the [Cold
War]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the tensions that came along with it.
This argument and the others advanced by Global Zero commission reveal
their effort as just another excuse for taking nuclear weapon systems
offline. The Accident Red Herring Another Global Zero argument for
eliminating the ICBMs and returning non-strategic nuclear weapons to the
United States is that it would reduce nuclear incidents or accidents.
(An accident would be an unexpected error due to a failure of procedures
such as an unauthorized launch or the loss of a nuclear weapon. An
incident would be an intentional hostile event involving a nuclear
weapon, facility, or component.) This is a red herring. There have
been32 known "broken arrows" (accidents involving nuclear weapons) in
the history of nuclear operations. The majority of these accidents
involved aircraft carrying nuclear weapons, and a majority of those
occurred in the 1960s when Strategic Air Command was flying airborne
alert. A significant accident happened in 1980 when a dropped wrench
socket hit a fuel line that eventually caused a liquid-fueled rocket to
explode and jettison the nuclear warhead some 600 feet downrange.
[Today's nuclear [weapons are **much more safe**]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[and secur]{.mark}e]{.underline}** than during the Cold War. The U.S.
nuclear arsenal has no liquid-fueled rockets (they are all solid fuel)
and no bombers flying on alert loaded with nuclear bombs. Finally,
[those who would de-alert the nuclear force claim that]{.underline} [the
**[slightest misinterpretation]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[could]{.mark}
[lead to a nuclear exchange]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[History refutes
this claim]{.underline}]{.mark}** as well. [During the Cold War, bomber
and reconnaissance aircraft]{.underline} **[routinely penetrated the
airspace of both sides]{.underline}**. This was a commonly-accepted
practice to test resolve, prod air defenses, and to signal displeasure
with current policy or practices. [Even today]{.underline}, [Russian
bombers enter U.S. and European airspace]{.mark} [and]{.underline} U.S.
reconnaissance planes loiter on the boundaries of Russia.
[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[sends its B-2 Spirit bombers]{.underline} to Europe [and]{.underline}
Southeast Asia [to demonstrate political resolve]{.underline}. [**[It
did not lead to nuclear war in the past and it will not in the
future]{.underline}**, **[because]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[political
and military [leaders recognize]{.mark} this for what it
is]{.underline}** --- [**[strategic messaging]{.underline}**, **[not
acts of war]{.underline}**.]{.mark} During the early days of George W.
Bush's administration, a Chinese fighter aircraft ran into a U.S.
reconnaissance aircraft forcing it to land on Hainan Island. While this
was an international incident between two nuclear-weapon states, it did
not lead to nuclear war or even a change in the nuclear posture of both
countries. Additionally, previous misinterpretations of launches did not
lead to a nuclear exchange because both sides understand the importance
of strategic context. Some like to claim a false target on a radar
screen, a fly landing on the scope, or some other fanciful scenario
might happen that could cause an unauthorized nuclear first strike. The
Dr. Strangelove scenario of a Gen. Jack Ripper launching the nuclear
fleet on an attack to preserve the United States' "purity of essence"
makes for great entertainment but is hardly based on fact. As noted
above, [the president is the only person who can authorize a U.S.
nuclear release]{.underline} **[and [constant
communications]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[between the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and
Russia]{.underline}** (**[[through the]{.mark} White House
"]{.underline}[hot line[," the]{.underline} Nuclear Risk Reduction
Center[, the State Department, and the U]{.underline}]{.mark}[nited
[N]{.mark}ations]{.underline}**) work to **[[prevent such
scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While the Cold War is over and
tensions between the two sides have recently increased, **[there is no
current strategic context]{.underline}** [under which either side would
launch a bolt out of the blue]{.underline}. So does this mean nuclear
weapons should be pulled off alert? Absolutely not. No one can forecast
the future security environment of Russia and China. We are in a
multipolar world in which nuclear weapon states other than Russia also
pose an existential threat. [It is because our nuclear forces are on
alert that the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[remains free from the threat of nuclear or WMD attack]{.underline}**.
If there are people who cannot get out of the Cold War mentality of "Dr.
Strangelove," it is the Global Zero community and not the Air Force.

### No Miscalc War \-\-- 1NC

#### Miscalc doesn't cause conflict

Steven **Stashwick**, Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve,
completed graduate studies in international relations at the University
of Chicago, "South China Sea: Conflict Escalation and 'Miscalculation'
Myths", Sept 25th 2015,
<http://thediplomat.com/2015/09/south-china-sea-conflict-escalation-and-miscalculation-myths/>

**[This concern over local miscalculation]{.underline}** nonetheless
**[reflects a longstanding view of the danger]{.underline}**
**["incidents]{.underline}** at sea" **[poses to peace stretching back
to the Cold War.]{.underline}** Both U.S. and Soviet leaderships were
concerned that an incident between "peppery young ship captains" could
"lead people to shoot at each other with results that might...be
impossible to control," in the words of Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, U.S. Chief
of Naval Operations in the 1970s. Back then, the U.S. and Soviets were
openly adversarial and serious incidents between their ships and
aircraft were almost commonplace. Yet despite explicit mutual,
strategic, and existential antagonism between the U.S. and U.S.SR, none
of the hundreds of maritime incidents that occurred over the four
decades of the Cold War escalated into anything beyond a short
diplomatic crisis. **[It is possible that they avoided a nuclear spiral
in these incidents through diligent diplomacy and luck. But more likely,
it suggests that this type of]{.underline}** maritime **[incident is
insufficient on its own to lead to the worst-case scenarios
envisioned.]{.underline}** Mitigating the miscalculation concerns of
officials and the extreme scenarios of some commentators is that these
maritime incidents do not occur in a vacuum, de-coupled from explicit
national interests. In a famous 1988 Cold War incident, Soviet vessels
in the Black Sea shouldered the U.S. warships Yorktown and Caron (a
controlled collision meant to push a ship off-course) while the latter
were deliberately contesting what the U.S. deemed excessive Soviet legal
claims over maritime rights. The Soviets knew the U.S. vessels were
there to intentionally flout their claims, and the U.S. knew the Soviets
would likely try to enforce them. Even if the firmness of the Soviet
response was unanticipated (or deemed unlikely), there was no mystery to
either side's objectives. Thus, neither side was going to start shooting
in confusion; the Soviet vessels even radioed their intention to strike
the U.S. ships. While not "safe" in the strictest sense (ships do not
like to "swap paint" with each other), footage from the Yorktown and
Caron being pushed shows the actions to be intense but deliberate,
professionally executed, and clearly of an enforcement nature, rather
than a prelude to combat. While a serious diplomatic incident, both
sides understood the situation, which served to moderate concern over
escalation. Similarly, a shouldering incident between the U.S. cruiser
Cowpens and a Chinese warship in 2013, while concerning to the U.S. from
a safety-at-sea perspective, was understood to be motivated by Chinese
sensitivities around testing their new aircraft carrier, not a precursor
to hostilities. Nonetheless, concerns over maritime incidents,
miscalculation, and spiraling conflict contain enough intuitive logic to
have endured. A shared Cold War concern over miscalculations led to
accords that are still in effect, such as the Agreement on the
Prevention of Incidents on and Over the High Seas (INCSEA) and
Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities (DMA) agreement, and may be
credited with helping keep incidents between the U.S. and U.S.SR under
"control." However, the fact that agreements were reached at all is
likely more significant than their content. Such agreements indicated a
shared belief between U.S. and Soviet military leaderships that despite
their feverish preparations for war against one another, neither wanted
war to come as the result of a tactical-level incident between
individual ships and aircraft. This suggests neither would let an
incident, however serious, become an independent casus belli. The
substance of these accords (and those reached in the South China Sea)
further strengthens this thesis. While INCSEA and DMA contained rules of
behavior, these were, again in Zumwalt's words, "little more than a
reaffirmation of the \[maritime\] Rules of the Road" (international
rules that direct how ships stay safe around each other at sea). What
was groundbreaking was that in concluding the accords, the U.S. and
U.S.SR implicitly recognized their intentions to violate those rules and
practices when advantageous (consider the Yorktown and Caron). The
accords created new parallel rules by which each could do so "safely,"
as well as new communications protocols to inform one another of their
intentions. Together, this affirms that both sides were playing a
(serious) game to establish positions and assert rights more than they
were interested in war. Of course, incidents intended to reinforce
maritime claims and hostile actions can look the same right up until
ordnance is exchanged, but now both sides could be more confident that
if shooting did start, it was an intentional act of war. Precedent for
Restraint **[In Asia,]{.underline}** **[there is recent and dramatic
precedent for restraint]{.underline}**, **[even after an unambiguously
hostile local event]{.underline}**, which belies theoretical arguments
about the risk of miscalculation and unintended escalation. **[When the
South Korean warship]{.underline}** Cheonan **[was sunk]{.underline}**
in 2010, **[South Korea determined that North Korea was
responsible]{.underline}**. **[Far from a mere 'incident']{.underline}**
of the sort worried over in the South China Sea, **[this was a
belligerent act against South Korea's armed forces]{.underline}**.
**[And yet, there was no miscalculation-fueled conflict spiral, and
instead a strategically calibrated response.]{.underline}** It remains
unknown whether the sinking of the Cheonan was ordered by the North
Koreans (they continue to deny any responsibility), the act of a
renegade, or, perhaps least plausibly, an accident. What is clear is
that despite a sunken ship and 46 sailors killed, the incident did not
spiral out of control. **[This suggests that South Korea's political
calculus did not view militarily punishing North Korea worth the risk of
a renewed]{.underline}** -- and **[potentially nuclear]{.underline}** --
**[war]{.underline}**, **[which is to say that an extraordinary but
tactical-level event did not trump strategic preferences.]{.underline}**
Even so, **[some take the miscalculation-escalation dynamic so far as to
suggest that incidents between fishing vessels]{.underline}** and coast
guards in the South China Sea **[might lead to war. In view of
the]{.underline}** Cold War record and the recent **[Cheonan
example]{.underline}**, **[such propositions are drastically
overstated]{.underline}**. **[It is conceivable that a state already
resolved to escalate a dispute militarily might view a
local]{.underline}** maritime **[incident as a convenient casus
belli]{.underline}**. **[But in that emphatically calculated
case]{.underline}**, no institutional impediments to such incidents
would prevent the hostility.

### No cooperation

#### Submarine trading is the key final straw; wrecks NATO cohesion

Daniel **Williams 21**, Daniel Williams is a former foreign
correspondent for The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times and Miami
Herald and an ex-researcher for Human Rights Watch, 9/18/21,
"US-Australia submarine deal rocks NATO alliance," *Asia Times*,
<https://asiatimes.com/2021/09/us-australia-submarine-deal-rocks-nato-alliance/>,
JH

**[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, by [elbowing France aside in a
deal with Australia over military submarine purchases]{.mark}, has once
again [raised doubts about  Washington's commitment to]{.mark} the
[NATO]{.mark} alliance]{.underline}**.

Washington has also highlighted the speed with which President Joe Biden
is pivoting, at least militarily, to East Asia.

When Biden succeeded the oft-hostile Donald Trump, European allies
expected that his revival heralded a new era of close cooperation.
Instead, NATO has been hit with secretive decisions by Washington that
suggest disdain for Europe in general and, in this case, top ally France
in particular.

**[Most lately, there was Biden's helter-skelter withdrawal from
Afghanistan and a chaotic exodus of civilians that took place with
minimal coordination with NATO allies]{.underline}**.  In April, when
Biden made his decision to pull out, NATO had some 7,000 troops in the
country compared with 2,500 Americans. When in July, Biden ordered the
evacuation of the Bagram joint military air base in Afghanistan, he not
only failed to inform the Afghan government ahead of time but also NATO.

Biden offended his eastern European allies by acquiescing to Germany's
request it bless Nord Stream 2, the natural gas pipeline that bypasses
Ukraine and might give Moscow free rein to use energy as an economic
weapon against them.

**[The [submarine decision shows that the American]{.mark} new [military
focus east may disrupt traditional]{.mark} [allies in the
West]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The sub deal with further suggests there
may be more urgency than expected in bolstering a budding Indo-Pacific
alliance to include Japan and India.

Biden is scheduled to meet with leaders from Japan, India and Australia
in Washington on September 23. It will be the first face-to-face meeting
of the so-called Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, also known as the
Quad, which seeks to coordinate policies on several issues, notably
China's growing military power in East Asia.

**[The [French were livid]{.mark} about the Australia about-face on
submarines and US involvement]{.underline}**. On Friday, President
Emmanuel Macron recalled his ambassadors from Washington and Australia.

**[France -- America's oldest ally -- canceled a Washington party to
commemorate the 240th anniversary of the sea battle between French and
British ships off Yorktown]{.underline}**, Virginia. The French victory
permitted troops under the command of George Washington to defeat the
British and end the Revolutionary war.

**[Macron had signed a \$100 billion deal to sell Australia 12
diesel-powered submarines. Secretly, [the US countered by arranging to
provide Australia with tech]{.mark}nology to build nuclear-propelled
subs and to cancel the French order.]{.underline}** Secretary of States
Antony Blinken said France was informed in advance of the deal, but he
declined to say when.

French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called the turn of
events a stab in the back. **["We had established a trusting
relationship with Australia, and this [trust was
betrayed]{.mark}]{.underline}**," he said. He added France was given no
heads-up on the change of plans.

Le Drian also launched an especially biting critique of Biden, comparing
him to the despised Trump. **["What concerns me as well is the American
behavior," he said. "This brutal, unilateral, unpredictable decision
looks very much like what Mr Trump used to do.]{.underline}** Allies
don't do this to each other."

French Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly complained that the
Americans had decided to push aside an ally "at a time when we are
facing unprecedented challenges in the Indo-Pacific region."

**[For all the hub-bub, the Macron government had not shown any
enthusiasm for NATO possibly being dragged by the US into a
confrontation with China]{.underline}**. At the June NATO summit, Macron
publicly threw scorn on the idea. "NATO is an organization that concerns
the North Atlantic. China has little to do with the North Atlantic," he
said.

He wasn't alone. **[Germany's Chancellor Angel Merkel, described Russia,
not China, as "a major challenge"]{.underline}** and that NATO must not
"simply negate China."

"**[We have to find the right balance]{.underline}**." she concluded.

Achieving this vision will be difficult given national sensitivities
about data sharing in this domain[. Some countries may also be unwilling
to share data produced by national intelligence assets with their own
tactical units]{.underline}. [The United States faced this
problem]{.underline} at certain points [during]{.underline} [the Cold
War]{.underline} and [**it has the potential to again complicate efforts
to achieve the clearest possible picture of the undersea domain.** These
efforts will also be hindered by the physical challenges of wirelessly
transmitting large quantities of data]{.underline} from disparate
sensors to centralized processing locations. [Bandwidth limitations and
national sensitivities]{.underline} surrounding encrypted communications
are well understood within certain intelligence communities, especially
those that work with unmanned aerial systems (UAS), [but are not
uniformly understood across the policy community.]{.underline}

- link about increasing uuvs

Claims that **[AI could generate a "transparent ocean"112 or "selective
ocean transparency"113 likely overstate the ability of low-cost UUVs,
USVs, and UAVs]{.underline}** to conduct these steps. First, in order to
be low-cost, **[uninhabited vehicles are generally of limited size,
weight, and power (SWaP) capacity]{.underline}**, at least relative to
traditional attack submarines. These facts, combined with the
**[inherent physics-based difficulties of sensing in the undersea
environment]{.underline}**,114 mean that the **[sensors carried by any
given low-cost UUV, USV, or UAV will be of limited detection range
regardless of the phenomenologies they employ]{.underline}**.115 Given
the sensors' **[limited range]{.underline}**, ASW **[forces
would]{.underline}** **[need to deploy large numbers of sensor vehicles
to seamlessly cover even small oceanic areas]{.underline}**.116 UUVs
**[in particular are limited in endurance, because of their need to rely
on air-independent power sources such as batteries or fuel
cells.]{.underline}** This means that **[additional UUVs would be needed
to sustain a track on a submarine over time]{.underline}**, as UUVs
reach the end of the their operational endurance and need to return to
base. (Ultra-long endurance UUV power solutions, such as thermal gliders
that draw energy from ocean thermoclines, lack sufficient speed and
power to maintain track on a submarine.117) While fleets of UUVs, USVs,
and UAVs are likely to have cost-savings relative to traditional assets
and will be valuable supplements in a "high-low mix" of ASW
capabilities, the **[scale of assets needed to render even a portion of
the ocean "transparent" would likely be enormous]{.underline}**. Setting
cost and practicality aside, **[ASW forces would also have to keep these
sensors appropriately positioned to maintain high-confidence area
surveillance and target tracking]{.underline}**. This would **[require a
level of multi-system control reliability and resilience not yet
demonstrated.]{.underline}**118 Fewer sensors would be required to
monitor ocean chokepoints. But **[only Chinese and British SSBNs must
pass through chokepoints to hold their primary targets at
risk]{.underline}** -- and **[both countries have offset this
risk.]{.underline}** Although Chinese SSBNs **[would need to pass
through chokepoints in the First Island Chain]{.underline}** to cover
the entire United States, **[China's land-based mobile ICBM force can
cover targets at that range.]{.underline}** Likewise, British SSBNs must
pass through chokepoints to the north or south of Ireland to reach deep
waters. But, as British Rear Admiral John Gower has written, monitoring
those chokepoints would probably still require a high number of
sensors.119 And the costs of maintaining or cycling those systems would
still be high. Furthermore -- and crucially -- **[any UUVs, USVs, or
UAVs deployed in the chokepoints would be subject to countermeasures
employed on an adaptive basis, including improved stealth, jamming,
multi-phenomenology decoys and spoofing, evasive maneuvers, or outright
destruction by SSBN protection forces]{.underline}**.120 Many of the
**[same countermeasures could also be used against sensors operating in
the open ocean]{.underline}**. **[Even if ASW forces were able to
maintain optimal sensor coverage in the search area, they would then
face problems of data transmission]{.underline}** that **[automation is
ill suited to solve]{.underline}**. The UUVs, USVs, and UAVs sent to
monitor the open ocean or a chokepoint **[must be able to share data --
processed or raw -- amongst themselves -- directly or through command
nodes]{.underline}** -- **[in a timely manner in order to maintain
coverage, cue and direct searches, confidently classify a contact as an
SSBN, and then support weapons employment against the
SSBN]{.underline}**. In order to be used effectively, any vehicle that
attains a track on an SSBN **[would need to be able to transmit that
data to another vehicle.]{.underline}**121 While highly automated
network management technologies may be able to enhance communications
resilience between uninhabited -- or uninhabited and inhabited -- ASW
platforms,122 such **[data transmission will remain a vulnerability for
any undersea communications]{.underline}**.123 It bears noting that the
**[physics of undersea communications results in fairly short range
communications paths at low data rates]{.underline}**. **[Longer range
communications paths and higher data rates forces reliance on surface or
airborne communications relays that are vulnerable to jamming or other
interference.]{.underline}** **[Even temporary or partial delays in data
transmission could undermine ASW forces' abilities to localize an
SSBN]{.underline}** -- and given that the **[window of opportunity to
localize a submarine may be very short]{.underline}**, an **[inopportune
communications delay or disruption may make the
difference]{.underline}** between **[ASW success and
failure]{.underline}**.124 Finally, if we **[assume that ASW forces
relying on UUVs, USVs, and UAVs were able to confidently classify and
localize an SSBN]{.underline}** in their search area, they **[would need
to maintain localization long enough for an ASW weapons-carrying
platform to close within attack range of the SSBN and successfully
engage]{.underline}** it. If a weapons-carrying platform is located
close by, for instance, near a chokepoint through which a SSBN is
transiting and where that SSBN's protection forces are unable provide
effective coverage -- again, an implausible scenario for reasons of both
geography and nuclear force structure for all nuclear-armed states --
this may be a relatively easy problem to solve. However, if the search
is occurring in the open ocean, the **[sheer expanse of that area
suggests that a weapons-carrying platform is unlikely to be within
immediately-actionable proximity of the SSBN when confident
classification is made.]{.underline}**125 Automated protocols might
reduce the time required to signal and dispatch an ASW weaponscarrying
platform. But **[the weapons-carrying platform's transit time alone
would leave a window for the SSBN's crew to conduct
countermeasures]{.underline}**---or for inherently dynamic underwater
conditions to **[degrade the ability of the sensors in contact to
maintain track.]{.underline}** This time window could be reduced by
arming uninhabited vehicles directly. Nevertheless, **[the problems of
coordinating multiple vehicles, at scale, for an extended period of
time,]{.underline}** and **[robustly in a challenging communications
environment amidst adversary countermeasures remains]{.underline}**. If
**[ASW forces miss any of these steps, then they will be unable to
detect, classify, localize, and engage the SSBN]{.underline}**. To
successfully prosecute a disarming first strike against a nation's
entire SSBN fleet, **[an opposing nation's ASW forces would need to
execute the entire kill chain for every one of those boats -- and
probably near-simultaneously to avoid triggering fleet-wide
countermeasures]{.underline}** (which would **[render subsequent ASW
operations even more difficult) or strategic
escalation]{.underline}**.126

One of the **[crucial elements of a secure second-strike capability is
an early warning of incoming nuclear missiles and launch platforms being
communicated to strike back]{.underline}**. However, **[communication
with a submerged vessel is one of the most challenging aspects of
underwater warfare]{.underline}**. The **[stealth feature of a submarine
is only viable if it is underwater as the probability of detection and
interception increases when it is closer to the surface]{.underline}**.
This conundrum of communication while maintaining stealthiness is
somewhat addressed by using the extremely low frequency of 3 Hz to 30
Hz.

However, in the case of **[autonomous unmanned submarines]{.underline}**
carrying nukes, **[one can never be sure if the transmitted message is
conceived in time and in the manner it was intended]{.underline}**. When
compared with the **[potential for autonomous underwater platforms to
enhance a country's deterrence capabilities]{.underline}**, **[the risk
and cost, if things go wrong, are simply too high.  ]{.underline}**

Despite having little to no utility in a nuclear standoff, Orca-class
submarines are still likely to have a considerable impact on the future
of naval warfare. **[The potency of nuclear weapons is such that the
core principles pertinent to their deployment and operation are more or
less the same since their advent]{.underline}**, **[regardless of the
technology that has exponentially improved since Trinity, the first
detonation of a nuclear bomb]{.underline}**.

Aircraft use one type of sensor to search for submarines that has been
proposed for UAVs -- **[magnetic anomaly detectors]{.underline}**. These
**[sense the [disturbance]{.mark} of the Earth's magnetic field produced
by]{.underline}** the submarine's **[ferromagnetic hull and steel
components.]{.underline}** The steel hull of a submarine (and of most
surface ships) not only acts asalarge magnet, but its movement through
the water generates additional magnetic effects. **[These effects [can
be mitigated if a submarine uses a degaussing system]{.mark} -- coils of
wire within the vessel that carry an electrical current to generate an
equal and opposite magnetic field to that of the hull.]{.underline}**
This '**[magnetic cloaking]{.underline}** device' **[cancels out the
magnetic disturbance.]{.underline}** The latest 'closed-loop degaussing
system' is very effective at reducing a submarine's magnetic signature.
Nevertheless, close to the vessel the magnetic field of the submarine is
irregular and difficult to cancel out completely. This gives some
opportunity for the small residual magnetic disturbance to be detected
within about 1 km, meaning that **[magnetic anomaly detectors are very
short-range sensors.]{.underline}**

Advances in technology have led to the miniaturisation of magnetic
anomaly detectors so they could be mounted on UAVs; these detectors are
now being considered for the ship- and aircraftlaunched MagEagle version
of the ScanEagle autonomous UAVs. 11 These UAVs would be useful for
anti-submarine warfare forces to confirm the exact position of a
submarine that has already been detected. However, their **[[detection
range is so modest that searching the vast spaces of the unpredictable
oceans is unlikely]{.mark} to be the best use of UAVs.]{.underline}**
Moreover, **[[advances in detection]{.mark} technology [are usually
countered by]{.mark} advances in signature
[reduction]{.mark}]{.underline}** (improved degaussing) **[and
consequent further reduction of detection ranges.]{.underline}** The
introduction of new countermeasures to confuse the detector would also
mitigate the advances in detection technology.

Data **[The study team interviewed]{.underline}** and collected input
from **[many DoD stakeholders with responsibility for
data]{.underline}** and infrastructure. The team **[also]{.underline}**
interviewed **[DoD personnel who use]{.underline}** these
**[data]{.underline}** **[and infrastructure for]{.underline}**
analytics or **[AI purposes]{.underline}**. One striking aspect of our
interviews was the general enthusiasm expressed for the JCF, with "wish
lists" that included the development of uniform policies for sandboxing
and application programming interfaces,32 the development of common
algorithm libraries and repositories for open source projects, and reuse
of code components and documentation of best practices (see section
"Organization: At the OSD Level" in Appendix B). A notable development
within DoD is the recent creation of the CDO role, with Michael Conlin
in place as DoD's first CDO as of August 2018. We anticipate that with
time, the data posture of DoD will significantly evolve. Nonetheless,
through our interviews, we **[identified several serious obstacles and
impediments in regard to data]{.underline}** at present. **[Data are not
collected and stored at every opportunity.]{.underline}** **[DoD's
software infrastructure exists in an environment in which storage space
remains a scarce resource]{.underline}** and **[many opportunities to
record data are missed]{.underline}**. **[Even if modern storage
infrastructure capacities were acquired]{.underline}**, **[additional
barriers]{.underline}** might **[prevent]{.underline}** the mass
**[collection]{.underline}** **[and storage]{.underline}** of 32
Sandboxing refers to providing an isolated environment for
experimentation with software. Sandbox environments would ideally have
some amount of test data and computing resources but are set up so that
what happens in the sandbox is isolated from the production environment
that supports actual real-world operations. 58 The Department of Defense
Posture for Artificial Intelligence data**[. In particular, DoD still
faces significant constraints on network bandwidth,]{.underline}**
**[which can hamper the ability to move data collected from sensors in
the field to a location where they can be stored]{.underline}**.
Additionally, DoD's suite of software was designed for and implemented
in an era in which applications stored only data for which DoD had an
immediate use, rather than speculatively storing data that could be
mined for insights by professionals. This situation has **[resulted both
in inadequate data storage and in storage of less-appropriate
data;]{.underline}** in addition, too much of the data collected have
already been transformed from a raw, foundational form into an
intermediate or aggregated result. These transformations, although an
appropriate optimization at the time, strip away crucial context from
information needed to train modern ML-based algorithms. Finally,
**[outdated collection processes result in some data not being collected
and digitized]{.underline}**; recent RAND work on acquisition data
within DoD illustrates this point.33 **[Access to existing data is
limited.]{.underline}** **[Several barriers within DoD present
substantial obstacles to data-sharing today.]{.underline}** First,
**[personnel]{.underline}** might **[view data as a means of retaining
power or value in DoD or of protecting their work from extensive
oversight]{.underline}**, and **[therefore those personnel resist
data-sharing]{.underline}**. **[Additionally]{.underline}**, many
**[data owners resist sharing their data out of security concerns and
the worry that another organization might suffer a security
breach.]{.underline}** **[Finally]{.underline}**, the **[security
clearance process and other bureaucratic procedures can
introduce]{.underline}** a **[significant lag]{.underline}** before an
individual will be allowed to access data. **[This
problem]{.underline}** presents a particular difficulty in recruiting
new talent into DoD, and **[substantially lowers
productivity]{.underline}**, even for long-standing DoD personnel. Some
of these issues, **[as they pertain to acquisition data]{.underline}**,
were highlighted in a recent RAND report.34 Informal networks can
substantially reduce the delay in gaining access to data, but based on
our interviews, these workarounds appear to be haphazard. Lack of
interoperability in systems across DoD creates challenges.
**[Interoperability of data collected by different
systems]{.underline}**, even within the same functional domain,
**[remains a problem]{.underline}**. **[Software applications within DoD
have not typically been designed to work with other DoD
applications]{.underline}**---even applications in the same functional
domain. Consequently, **[establishing relationships between data
collected by one system and data collected by another can be virtually
impossible]{.underline}**. Even worse, it appears that DoD leadership is
often presented with inconsistent values originating from different
systems for the same data point, undermining leadership's willingness to
trust data from DoD systems or make decisions based on data at all (see
section "Data" in Appendix B). **[The data that exist are
not]{.underline}** always **[understandable or traceable]{.underline}**.
**[DoD systems]{.underline}** frequently **[lack]{.underline}** the
**[documentation]{.underline}** or metadata **[required to provide
context as to what particular data actually mean]{.underline}** or how
they were generated. For example, an Army database might store a numeric
value for the number of tanks at a particular facility, but it might not
explain whether this number indicates all functional tanks, all tanks
assigned to a particular unit, or all tanks of any status present at the
location. Other data values with less descriptive names will frequently
be even more difficult to comprehend and use. **[The lack of any
centralized tool for data service means that it is difficult for
DoD]{.underline}** personnel, even in leadership, **[to]{.underline}**
**[discover what data might be available to inform a
question]{.underline}**. Instead, discovering new data sources and
interpreting them typically requires personal networks or other informal
mechanisms. In sum, all indications are that DoD data are not currently
being used to their full potential. Overall, **[the problems we
noted]{.underline}** here **[represent]{.underline}**
**[a]{.underline}** **[formidable obstacle to implementing AI
algorithms]{.underline}**,35 even at the level of enterprise AI. Both
Project Maven and the JAIC's preventative maintenance prototype have
found that **[issues around data quality and availability are a primary
barrier to progress]{.underline}** (see section "Data" in Appendix B).
These issues, if left unresolved, will continue to hamper the
development and deployment of AI throughout DoD. Additionally, we
highlight the following friction point. **[There is ambiguity in data
ownership where external vendors are involved.]{.underline}** In theory,
**[data that originate in DoD should be owned by DoD]{.underline}**. In
practice, **[when DoD data]{.underline}** are analyzed or otherwise
**[worked on by external vendors,]{.underline}** **[the ownership of the
data]{.underline}**, albeit in a new modified form, **[becomes
murky]{.underline}**. This issue was highlighted in recent unpublished
RAND work addressing weapon system intellectual property and data
rights. This ambiguity of ownership **[leads to multiple problems beyond
the specific ownership and potential loss of control of the
data]{.underline}**, **[including vendor lock to retain use of the data,
the inability to aggregate data across multiple vendors, and the
inability to use the data for additional internal
purposes]{.underline}**, among others. Although this problem is not
unique to DoD, as some of our industry interviewees described (see
section "Industry: Data" in Appendix C), it is one that DoD also needs
to come to terms with.

[[China is developing large, smart]{.mark} and relatively [low-cost
unmanned submarines that can roam]{.mark} the world's [oceans]{.mark} to
perform a wide range of missions, from **reconnaissance** to **mine
placement** to even **suicide attacks against enemy
vessels**,]{.underline} according to scientists involved in these
artificial intelligence (AI) projects. [The autonomous robotic
submarines are expected to be deployed in the **early
2020s**]{.underline}. While not intended to entirely replace
human-operated submarines, [they will [challenge]{.mark} the
**[advantageous position established by Western naval powers]{.mark}**
after the second world war. The robotic subs are [aimed]{.mark}
particularly [at]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [forces
in]{.mark} strategic waters like **[the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea** and western Pacific Ocean, the researchers
said]{.underline}. China boosts naval power with Asia's most advanced
warship [The project is part of the government\'s ambitious [plan to
boost]{.mark} the country\'s **[naval power with AI
technology]{.mark}**.]{.underline} China has built the world\'s largest
testing facility for surface drone boats in Zhuhai, Guangdong province.
[Military researchers are also developing an AI-assisted support system
for submarine commanders.]{.underline} As the South China Morning Post
reported earlier this year[, that system will help captains make faster,
more accurate judgments in the heat of combat situations.]{.underline}
The new class of unmanned submarines will join the other autonomous or
manned military systems on water, land and orbit to carry out missions
in coordinated efforts, according to the researchers. [**[The submarines
will have no human operators]{.underline}**]{.mark} on board. [They will
go out, handle their assignments and return to base on their
own.]{.underline} They may establish contact with the ground command
periodically for updates, but are by design [[capable of]{.underline}
**[completing missions without human
intervention]{.underline}**]{.mark}. China is developing autonomous
robotic submarines to join other manned military systems such as the
Chinese navy\'s Type 039A diesel electric submarine (pictured) to carry
out coordinated missions on water, land and orbit. Photo: Handout But
the researchers also noted that AI subs had limits, especially at the
early stages of deployment. They will start with relatively simple
tasks. The purpose of these projects is not to replace human crews
entirely. To attack or not to attack, the final decision will still be
in the hands of commanders, the researchers said. Current models of
unmanned underwater vehicles, or UUVs, are mostly small. Their
deployment and recovery require another ship or submarine. They are
limited in operational range and payload capacity. Now under
development, the AI-powered subs are "giants" compared to the normal
UUVs, according to the researchers. They station in dock as conventional
submarines. Their cargo bay is reconfigurable and large enough to
accommodate a wide range of freight, from powerful surveillance
equipment to missiles or torpedoes. Their energy supply comes from
diesel-electric engines or other power sources that ensure continuous
operation for months[. The robotic submarines rely heavily on artificial
intelligence to deal with the sea's complex environment]{.underline}.
They must make decisions constantly on their own: changing course and
depth to avoid detection; distinguishing civilian from military vessels;
choosing the best approach to reach a designated position. [[They
can]{.mark} gather intelligence, deploy mines or [station themselves at
geographical "chockpoints]{.mark}" where armed forces are bound to pass
[to ambush enemy targets]{.mark}. They can work with manned submarines
as a scout or decoy to draw fire and expose the position of the
adversary. If necessary, they can [ram into a high-value
target]{.mark}.]{.underline} Lin Yang, marine technology equipment
director at the Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of
Sciences, confirmed to the South China Morning Post this month that
China is developing a series of extra-large unmanned underwater
vehicles, or XLUUVs. "Yes, we are doing it," he said. The institute, in
China's northeast Liaoning province, is a major producer of underwater
robots to the Chinese military. Lin developed China's first autonomous
underwater vehicle with operational depth beyond 6km. He is now chief
scientist of the 912 Project, a classified programme to develop
new-generation military underwater robots in time for the 100-year
anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party in 2021. [Naval drill row
signals rough seas ahead for China-US military ties Lin called China's
unmanned submarine programme a [countermeasure against similar
weapons]{.mark} now under intensive development [in the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. He declined to elaborate on technical
specifications because the information was "sensitive". "It will be
announced sooner or later, but not now," he added. The US military last
year made a deal with major defence contractors for two prototype XLUUVs
by 2020. The US Navy would choose one prototype for the production of
nine vehicles. Lockheed Martin's Orca system would station in an area of
operation with the ability to establish communication to base from time
to time. It would return home after deploying payloads, according to the
company's website. "A critical benefit of Orca is that Navy personnel
launch, recover, operate, and communicate with the vehicle from a home
base and are never placed in harm's way," the company said in a
statement announcing the system. Technical details on Orca, like its
size or operational endurance, are not available. The company did not
respond to the Post's queries. [Snubbed in world's biggest war game,
will Beijing make waves in South China Sea? Boeing is developing the
other prototype, basing it on its Echo Voyager, a 50-ton autonomous
submarine first developed for commercial uses like the mapping of the
sea floor. The Echo Voyager is more than 15 metres long and 2.6 metres
in diameter, according to Boeing.]{.underline} It can operate for months
over a range of 12,000km, more than enough to sail from San Francisco to
Shanghai. Its maximum speed reaches 15km an hour. The vessel needs to
surface periodically as its batteries need to be recharged by
air-breathing diesel engines. It can dive to 3km while carrying up to
eight tons of cargo, Boeing said. Russia has reportedly built a large
underwater drone capable to carry a nuclear weapon. The Status-6
autonomous torpedo could cruise across large distances between
continents at high speed and deliver a 100-megaton warhead, according to
news accounts. China enlists top scientists in mission to become
military tech superpower The Chinese unmanned submarine would not be
nuclear-armed, according to a researcher involved in a separate
programme in China. [The main advantage of the AI subs is that **they
can be [produced and operated on a large scale at a relatively low
cost]{.mark}**, said the researcher]{.underline}, who requested
anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. [Traditional
submarines must attain a high level of stealth to increase the chance of
survival. The design has to consider other things including safety,
comfort and the mental health of the crew to ensure human
safety.]{.underline} All these elements add costs. In the 1990s, an
Ohio-class submarine for the US Navy cost US\$2 billion. The research,
development and purchase of the first 12 of its new Columbia-class
submarines, scheduled for delivery in the early 2020s, is more than
US\$120 billion. In contrast, the budget of the entire Orca programme is
about US\$40 million, according to Lockheed Martin. [An AI sub "can be
instructed to take down a nuclear-powered submarine or other high-value
targets. It can even perform a kamikaze strike,"]{.underline} said the
researcher, referring to the suicide attacks some Japanese fighter
pilots made in the second world war. "[**The AI has no soul. It is
perfect for this kind of job**," the researcher added. Luo Yuesheng,
professor at the College of Automation in Harbin Engineering University,
a major development centre for China's new submarines, contended that AI
subs would put the human captains **of other vessels under enormous
pressure** in battle. It is not just that the AI subs are fearless, Luo
said, but that they could learn from the sinking of other AI vessels
**and adjust their strategy continuously**. An unmanned submarine
trained to be familiar **to a specific water** "**will be a formidable
opponent**", he said.]{.underline} AI submarines are still at an early
stage, Luo noted, and many technical and engineering hurdles remain
before they can be deployed in open water. Hardware on board, for
instance, must meet high standards of quality and reliability, since no
mechanics will be on board to fix a broken engine, repair leaking pipes
or tighten a screw, he said. The missions of unmanned submarines will
also likely be limited to specific, relatively simple tasks, Luo said.

When, in mid-September, **[Australia]{.underline}**,
**[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[K]{.underline}**ingdom
**[and the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[announced]{.underline}** the
**[new]{.underline}** "AUKUS" **[security pact]{.underline}** **[among
the three partners]{.underline}**, it was clear that their **[first
priority]{.underline}** **[was]{.underline}** nuclear-powered
**[submarines]{.underline}** for the Royal Australian Navy.

As US Naval War College Professor Andrew S. Erickson wrote in Foreign
Policy, the nuclear submarine play is a "**[no brainer]{.underline}**"
**[for Australia]{.underline}**. Even though the deal to procure nuclear
subs through technology sharing with the United States and the United
Kingdom upset France, which had been set to sell conventional attack
submarines to Australia, **[the move was a diplomatic and security
master stroke for Australia,]{.underline}** **[which
seeks]{.underline}** **[closer security integration]{.underline}**
**[with the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[as tensions with China continue to
rise.]{.underline}**

The **[power and endurance associated with nuclear
submarines]{.underline}** **[speak to what Australia calculates it needs
for its own defence in a tough neighbourhood]{.underline}**. **[China
has adopted a]{.underline}** **[threatening posture]{.underline}**
toward Australia, **[and the latter clearly feels there is no option but
to respond with a show of strength.]{.underline}**

But as I wrote shortly after AUKUS was announced, this **[deal was never
going]{.underline}** **[to be limited to nuclear subs]{.underline}**.
The **[trio of partners telegraphed from the outset that the agreement
would expand to deeper collaboration on high-tech initiatives such as
cybersecurity and quantum cryptography]{.underline}**.

Tom Tugendhat, chair of the United Kingdom's foreign affairs committee,
put his finger on it from the day the pact was announced. He wrote,
"**[From artificial intelligence to advanced technology the US, UK and
Australia will now be able to cost save by increasing platform sharing
and innovation costs. Particularly for the smaller two, that's
game-changing]{.underline}**."

In a mere two months --- no time flat, in international diplomacy ---
AUKUS members have brought this intention to life.

The Wall Street Journal reported on November 17 that Australia plans to
invest US\$81 million in quantum technology, including a new innovation
hub "that will foster strategic partnerships with like-minded countries"
to commercialize that forthcoming Australian research.

Indicating the depth of the technology sharing likely to underpin the
new institute's research, Australian political science professor Andrew
O'Neil, quoted in the same article, has stated that the "AUKUS pact
gives us access to key technologies that can reinforce our ability to
maintain self reliance as a national defense strategy going forward."
O'Neil says that, historically, "**[there's always been a slight point
of contention among Australian policy makers in that America has never
really let Australia into the crown jewels of U.S.
capabilitie]{.underline}**s."

An **[unprecedented]{.underline}** **[U.S.]{.underline}** legislative
**[framework]{.underline}** **[would]{.underline}**
**[include]{.underline}** not only **[information sharing]{.underline}**
agreements on nuclear propulsion, but also **[on]{.underline}** much
**[broad]{.underline}**er **[areas]{.underline}** **[in key
sectors]{.underline}**. Such a **[framework]{.underline}** could
**[allow]{.underline}** for **[innovation to flourish]{.underline}**,
particularly **[as]{.underline}** **[AUKUS]{.underline}** **[looks for
opportunities in]{.underline}** **[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence, quantum, **[and]{.underline}**
**[other]{.underline}** **[key]{.underline}** defense
**[technologies]{.underline}**. The **[role of the private
sector]{.underline}**, and the complications therein, **[is an under
analyzed]{.underline}** **[aspect to AUKUS]{.underline}**. For example,
Lockheed Martin was going to provide Australia with the weapons systems
for its recently terminated French submarine contract; now the company
may well be the supplier of the weapons systems for newly planned
Australian nuclear submarine. And yet, just two days after the
announcement of AUKUS, BAE and Rolls Royce won the contract to design a
new nuclear powered submarine for the UK, which may have implications
for Australia\'s new submarine, and Lockheed, too. The involvement of
defense industry will also raise issues regarding commercial data
sensitivities and intellectual property issues---both of which should be
studied, as they may require additional legislative attention.

**[AUKUS]{.underline}** would **[need to be]{.underline}** **[adequately
resourced]{.underline}** **[to take on these tasks]{.underline}**,
**[which would entail a]{.underline}** distributed **[governance
framework]{.underline}** **[with]{.underline}** **[shared
responsibilities]{.underline}** and committed staff and resources,
including political **[and organizational support from]{.underline}**
Canberra, London, and **[Washington]{.underline}**. In the U.S., for
example, the **[D]{.underline}**epartments **[o]{.underline}**f
**[D]{.underline}**efense, State and Energy would **[have roles to
play]{.underline}**. It has been assumed that **[AUKUS is largely
focused on the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**, thus drawing interests from
U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. **[That sai]{.underline}**d, **[given the
broad technology interest in AUKUS, it also draws in the Defense
Technology Security Agency and Cyber Command.]{.underline}** The U.K.
would see input from the Cabinet Office, the Ministry of Defence, the
Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Royal Navy. In
Canberra the primary interests will be from the Department of Prime
Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the
Royal Australian Navy and the Department of Defence. Two Australian
cabinet officials have defence portfolios relevant to AUKUS, including
the minister for defence as well as the minister for defence industry.

In launching AUKUS, a number of working groups have been established to
study and flesh out the cooperative details. In order to be effective,
these working groups could be empowered by strong leadership, informed
by evidence-based analysis, and encouraged to convene regularly. **[They
could go beyond admiring the problems to identifying
solutions]{.underline}**. **[The success of the working groups would
also greatly depend on the active and continuous support of senior
leadership from all three nations.]{.underline}**

More specifically, the AUKUS working groups could have access to the
requisite expertise. Senior leaders could also ensure that the working
groups have access to experts, practitioners, and program implementers
from Australia, the U.S., and the UK who would understand the breadth
and depth of the existing barriers and the necessary workarounds.
**[This could be challenging: in the process of developing the
cooperative framework, AUKUS is likely to shine a bright light on the
many barriers to collaboration---not only technical, but also
bureaucratic, budgetary, cultural, regulatory, political, and
strategic.]{.underline}**

AUKUS could benefit from clear, measurable outcomes for each working
group, developed from the outset. For example, successfully meeting
working group deliverable dates is an obvious and essential metric, as
is consistent maintenance of working group meeting schedules and speed
of decision making. **[Progress in armaments cooperation is another
metric, and includes changing processes that facilitate innovation and
deepening of cooperation]{.underline}**. The ability to resolve key
bureaucratic barriers (such as routine overclassification of
information) and regulatory challenges (such as technology transfer
limitations) would be yet another hurdle to overcome. **[The three
capitals might develop multi-year plans detailing proposed projects,
anticipated costs, and timelines for delivery. Success on each of these
projects could be reported annually.]{.underline}**

The experiment of **[AUKUS]{.underline}** clearly **[seems to offer
significant opportunities]{.underline}** for Canberra, London, and
Washington. More than a repackaging of existing capabilities, AUKUS
reimagines the way in which three capable allies could work together,
more closely than ever before, in many respects. The **[potential
success of AUKUS will rely upon the effective management of this
mini-lateral arrangement]{.underline}**, and each countries\'
willingness to adopt new policies and make legislative changes to allow
for this close collaboration. **[Making such changes would require
strong management]{.underline}**, but even more so, it would require the
recognition from all parties that such changes are necessary to make
progress in addressing common, overriding strategic goals. **[What
happens now will determine whether the U.S., Australia and the UK can
compete more effectively against China and Russia]{.underline}**, **[or
whether AUKUS becomes an interesting footnote in the story of what could
have been.]{.underline}**

Others argue that **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[is]{.underline}** **[spurring]{.underline}**
**[the arms race]{.underline}**, in that the **[expansive]{.underline}**
**[U.S. modernization]{.underline}** program might **[heighten
the]{.underline}** **[mistrust]{.underline}** **[between the two nations
and provide Russia with an]{.underline}** **[incentive]{.underline}**
**[to expand its programs beyond]{.underline}** **[what was needed to
replace aging Soviet-era systems]{.underline}**.155 Former Secretary of
Defense William Perry raised this point in an interview in 2015, when
the Obama Administration offered its support to the full scope of U.S.
nuclear modernization programs. **[He noted that "we\'re now at the
precipice]{.underline}**, **[maybe I should say the brink, of a new
nuclear arms race"]{.underline}** that "will be at least as expensive as
the arms race we had during the Cold War, which is a lot of money." 156
Some have disputed the notion that the modernization programs are either
evidence of an arms race or an incentive to pursue one. Both nations are
modernizing their forces because existing systems are aging out; neither
is pursuing these programs because the other is modernizing its forces,
and neither would likely cancel its programs if the other refrained from
its efforts. As former Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter noted in 2016,
"In the end, though, this is about maintaining the bedrock of our
security and after too many years of not investing enough, it's an
investment that we, as a nation, have to make because it's critical to
sustaining nuclear deterrence in the 21st century." 157 **[Russia seems
to be in a similar position]{.underline}**; **[it delayed a planned
modernization cycle in the late 1990s and has been pursuing a number of
programs at a relatively slow pace since that]{.underline}** time.
Moreover, the **[new types]{.underline}** **[of strategic offensive arms
introduced recently seem to be more of a response to concerns about U.S.
missile defense programs]{.underline}** **[than a response to U.S.
offensive modernization programs]{.underline}**.

[The use of space-based systems for ASW missions is not
new]{.underline}. Overhead imaging has been used to track naval
deployments that include submarines for at least two decades. Because of
this fact, many [nations have built covered bases for their submarine
fleets to prevent]{.underline} or limit the [ability of other nations to
monitor]{.underline} their deployments [from space.]{.underline}
Unclassified [sources point to new uses for space-based monitoring
systems for ASW]{.underline}. Such systems fall into a broader category
of nonacoustic tracking of submerged vessels. These technologies
generally include aerial- and space-based sensors, but almost [all
require the synthesis of multiple sensors in order to accurately track
an adversary\'s submarine]{.underline}. This requires substantial
processing and band¬width to achieve. It is believed that the Soviet
Union was investing in these technologies before the end of the Cold
War. The present state of Russian research in this area is unclear to
the CSIS study team. **[A breakthrough in this technology area could
create a paradigm shift in undersea warfare.]{.underline}** Desired
Effect: In the near term, space-based systems will provide some measure
of warning before submarine deployment. In the long term, [space-based
systems could transform undersea warfare]{.underline}. Any such
breakthrough is likely decades in the future, but the potentially
disruptive nature of these future systems along with potential
Soviet/Russian research efforts in this sphere merit some amount of
consideration.

various bases and shipyards around the country, and later to study the
expansion of China's submarine infrastructure (a network of shipyards,
naval bases, underground facilities for missile storage, and submarine
demagnetization facilities).4 [Imagery of construction at Longpo Naval
Base]{.underline}---the home of China's southern SSBN
fleet---[revealed]{.underline} interesting [clues about China's SSBN
program]{.underline}. For example, Kristensen observed the installation
of China's first submarine demagnetization facility, which strips
submarine hulls of residual magnetic fields, pointing to Chinese efforts
to deploy less detectable submarines.5 Catherine Dill of the [Center for
Nonproliferation Studies]{.underline} (CNS) published an article
revisiting efforts to count China's operational Jin-class submarines,
but unlike Kristensen, she did so [using high frequency satellite
imagery from Planet Labs]{.underline}.6 High frequency imagery has
revolutionized open-source analysis because it is characterized by a
high revisit rate. Often, Planet Labs prioritizes frequent imaging of
the same sites (up to twice daily) [to enable rapid change detection, as
well as comparison of images across multiple sites over the same time
periods.]{.underline} Dill captured images of two critical Chinese
submarine facilities---the Bohai shipyard and the Longpo Naval Base---on
the same day. This enabled her to count Chinese SSBNs more accurately;
when using images from different dates, there is a risk of double
counting or other errors. [North Korea maintains one of the largest
submarine fleets in the world]{.underline}, estimated at between 64 and
86 submarines. The fleet is comprised primarily of conventionally-armed
submarines; however, [satellite imagery analysis in recent years has
uncovered North Korean efforts to build a class of diesel-electric SSBs
and submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs]{.underline}).7 In
2014, open-source analysts spotted North Korea's first Gorae-class (aka
Sinpo-class) ballistic missile submarine at the Sinpo South Naval
Shipyard.8 At the same time, analysts watched the development and
testing of a solid-fueled SLBM that could potentially arm Gorae-class
submarines.9

[Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a type of space-based imaging that
uses radar echoes to create very high resolution]{.underline} 2- or
3-dimensional [representations of]{.underline} landscapes, [bodies of
water]{.underline}, buildings, and other objects.10 [SAR sensors can
pick up tiny changes to landscapes---such as vehicular and foot
traffic---that optical sensors cannot detect]{.underline}. SAR imagery
first became commercially available in 1995, however companies did not
launch high-resolution SAR sensors until 2007. It's relative newcomer
status in the commercial sector means it is less accessible than optical
imagery and often prohibitively expensive.11 SAR sensors routinely image
the ocean for a variety of environmental, scientific, and law
enforcement applications. SAR sensors can also detect the wakes of large
surface ships. However, [SAR's ability to detect submarine wakes for
anti-submarine warfare (ASW) purposes remains inconclusive. SAR's
ability to enable analysts to detect even tiny changes makes the
technology potentially useful for monitoring submarine construction at
naval shipyards]{.underline}. For example, [SAR imagery could help
analysts to monitor North Korea]{.underline}'s Sinpo South Naval
Shipyard, and any construction on North Korea's expanding SSB fleet, by
imaging materiel movement. Additionally[, SAR sensors could be used to
monitor China]{.underline}'s Bohai for frequent updates on the
construction of additional Jin-class SSBNs.

From the evidence provided in Chapter I, it should be clear the United
States must be aware of the increasing levels of maritime activity in
the Arctic Circle. [It is strategically imperative for the]{.underline}
long term [security of North America to understand what maritime
activities]{.underline} that are occurring there in order to use U.S.
diplomatic, informational, military, and economic power to greatest
effect. Moreover, tactical responses to emergent issues such as vessels
in distress, hydrocarbon spills, and enforcement of laws and treaties
depend on the United States having a sustained information advantage in
the Arctic and in particular the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
contained within the Arctic Circle. Chapter II made evident that
**[space-based surveillance is likely the best way and perhaps the only
practical way to achieve the level of surveillance required of the
Arctic Circle]{.underline}**. Given the level of maritime surface area
within the Arctic Circle and the [applicability of SAR sensors to
detecting and characterizing maritime activities, it is sensible that
**SAR sensors are the answer to the nation's Arctic surveillance**
needs]{.underline}. Moreover, [a space-based SAR mission]{.underline}
supporting U.S. and allied government agencies [is consistent with
the]{.underline} National Security Space Strategy ([NSSS]{.underline})
of 2011 [which seeks to strengthen safety, stability, and security;
enhance advantages from space; and energize the space industrial
base]{.underline} (Department of Defense, 2011). The compelling case for
using SARs to meet the long-term surveillance needs of the U.S.
government in the Arctic begged a significant technical question: what
constellation design of SAR sensors would offer the best return on
investment for the United States?

[Aerial Systems]{.underline} This category [encompasses a range of
platforms from large MPAs based on commercial airliners to small UAS
that can be launched by a single operator]{.underline}. [Several
European nations are looking to replace or renew their maritime patrol
capability]{.underline}. As previously mentioned in Chapter 3, the UK is
acquiring several P-8 aircraft and the Norwegians may follow suit. Both
Germany and France will likely to have replace their MPA fleets in the
2020s. While a common airframe is unlikely, common payloads could help
defer some costs, streamline maintenance, and dramatically improve
interoperability. [These aerial platforms should have the capability to
serve as aerial intelligence processing and dissemi¬nation hubs for a
wide range of distributed sensors above, on, and **below the
sea.**]{.underline} NATO and partner nations should also consider how
**[UAS could augment or perhaps replace traditional manned ASW
assets]{.underline}**. With their exceptionally long loiter times and
potentially high payloads, [larger UAS seem to be ideal platforms for
seeding a range of distributed undersea sensors on short
notice]{.underline}. [Such platforms could also serve as a networking
hub for collecting data from these disturbed sensors and transmitting it
to a surface vessel or other central location of
processing]{.underline}. From an aerial sensors perspective, NATO and
partners should look beyond advanced periscope detection radars and
advanced sonobuoys (or sonobuoy-esque systems). [Future aerial sensors
could potentially include light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems or
advanced magnetic anomaly detector]{.underline}s. [Advances in sensor
technologies will likely enable smaller systems to be employed for ASW
missions, therefore bringing these capabilities to a wider array of
platforms]{.underline}. (For example, small patrol vessels less than 100
feet in length may be able to deploy with small ASW UAS, dramatically
improving the capabilities of small navies such as in Lithuania, Latvia,
and Estonia.) Desired Effect: [UAS]{.underline} [have the potential to
reshape the aerial ASW mission by creating an **inherently networked
solution**, as well as bring ASW abilities to a wider range of
platforms.]{.underline} Future sensors may also move away from the
acoustic detection paradigm.

#### Drones provide necessary ASW capabilities

**Larson 21**- a Defense Writer based in Europe. He holds a Master of

Sometime late last year, the [U.S. Navy tested]{.underline} one of
Northrop Grumman's remotely piloted helicopters [for use as **an
anti-submarine warfare** platform,]{.underline} USNI News reported.
During the evaluation, the Fire Scout [drone dropped miniaturized
sonobuoys into the water, essentially small acoustic devices that listen
for enemy movement underwater.]{.underline} As the name suggests, [the
primary goal of anti-submarine warfare platforms is to hunt down
submarines, in effect creating a protective bubble around surface ships
that are particularly vulnerable to submarine attack]{.underline}.
Though this mission is typically done by much larger manned aircraft,
like the MH-60R Sea Hawk, unmanned platforms like the Fire Scout offer
advantages in range and endurance compared to their manned counterparts.
They're also cheaper: [the loss of a drone is comparatively light and
less risky than putting a human pilot or pilots in harm's
way]{.underline}. In addition to deploying a mini hydrophone, an
offensive capability could in theory be packed into some drones in the
form of similarly miniaturized torpedos, like Northrop Grumman's Very
Lightweight Torpedo. [Given the advantages inherent to unmanned
anti-submarine warfare platforms, it comes as no surprise that the Navy
is interested]{.underline}. And, [it's not the first time the Navy has
been evaluating remotely operated platforms for a specialized ASW
role.]{.underline} Northrop Grumman's Fire Scout isn't the only done
that may protect American strike groups. [General Atomics,]{.underline}
the firm behind the iconic Predator and Reaper drones, is [also adapting
one of their drones for a submarine-hunting maritime
mission]{.underline}. Similar to the Fire Scout, [a modified Reaper
drone offers advantages in terms of mission endurance and logistics when
compared to a piloted anti-submarine warfare platform like the P-8A
Poseidon.]{.underline} [General Atomics's drone would be a boon to Navy
logistics]{.underline}: the company asserts that their SeaGuardian
[maritime drone uses 90% less fuel]{.underline} than similar
intelligence [and]{.underline} surveillance aircraft and that the
platform needs [50% fewer operations and support personnel than the
Navy's current anti-submarine warfare platforms]{.underline} require.
Northrop Grumman's Fire Scout would likely offer savings in fuel and
personnel as well. Postscript [One of the drawbacks to replacing the
manned anti-submarine warfare mission with drones is sonobuoy and
torpedo capacity]{.underline}. Though the aforementioned [drones do
offer real advantages in terms of range and logistics]{.underline}, a
single drone simply cannot carry the same quantity of munitions as a
much larger manned platform like the Poseidon. [S**till, the move toward
unmanned anti-submarine warfare platforms brings new and needed
capabilities** to the Navy and is a concept worth
exploring]{.underline}.

[Unmanned]{.underline} systems [technology]{.underline} [offers
potential applications]{.underline} for use [in]{.underline} the
[ASW]{.underline} mission area. Although [there are some systems
in]{.underline} [existence today,]{.underline} [most]{.underline} of
their sensors are directed at an intelligence­gathering mission and [have
limited direct application]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
[ASW]{.underline}, although innovative use of tactics to exploit sensor
capability should continue to be explored. However, **[the future is
promising for development of unmanned systems which are specifically
devoted to the ASW mission]{.underline}**. [ASW as a mission requires
extended sortie durations and sensor dwell times as well as data fusion
and data dissemination early in the prosecution]{.underline}, then
requires options for submarine engagement when the situation requires.
[New technology for swarming systems as well as potential developments
in a reliable high­bandwidth optical link capability make the future of
unmanned systems a viable near-term solution for aiding in the ASW
mission]{.underline}. Regardless, there will remain a requirement for
unmanned systems to integrate with other elements in the ASW domain,
including ships and manned aircraft. While unmanned systems are well
suited for detection and tracking phases of prosecution, manned aircraft
will, in the near­ term, likely remain necessary for torpedo delivery for
lethal effect.

initially reduced globally after the end of the Cold War, [there is a
growing trend of non­ Allied submarine operations in all sea areas
relevant to NATO operations.]{.underline} In recent years, [almost every
nation claiming a submarine capability has expanded its cur­ rent
inventory with more advanced and less detect­ able
submarines.]{.underline} The protection of a maritime force against
submarines consists of 'defence­in­depth' and close coordination among
friendly ships and submarines, helicopters, Maritime Patrol Aircraft
(MPA), and shore­based facilities. [Maritime ASW helicopters, in
particular, have increased in importance]{.underline} due to the
decreasing number of MPA available [in NATO]{.underline}. [These
helicopters are equipped with maritime radars optimized to detect
submarine snorkels or periscopes.]{.underline} Integrated dipping sonars
and dropped active/passive so­ nobuoys can be used to detect and track
contacts. Electronic Support Measures (ESM) technology and mounted
Magnetic Anomaly Detectors (MAD) are able to confirm the presence of
submerged threats, while data link capabilities provide real­time
information to the Fleet. Last but not least, [ASW helicopters can be
fitted with air launched torpedoes, which allow them to attack and
destroy enemy submarines.]{.underline}

[Surface systems]{.underline} are often thought of as second-class
citizens when it comes to ASW missions. However, they [play an important
role in the broader ASW system]{.underline}. They can host a wide array
of sensors, embark purpose-built ASW aircraft, and may serve as a
floating processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) center for a
variety of different sensors supporting a theater-level ASW campaign.
Planned **[NATO investments in large surface vessels capable of
performing the ASW mission and their respective sensors are likely
sufficient to meet current and future threats]{.underline}**. These
vessels are often not used as the proverbial tip of the spear in ASW
operations. That said, [NATO and its partners should explore investments
and experimentation with afloat PED systems to transform these surface
ships into the \"quarterbacks\" of the ASW mission.]{.underline} The
[use of unmanned surface vessels (USVs) is a potential growth
area]{.underline} in these missions. An example of such a system is the
Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV)
currently being tested by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA). There are also a host of commercially available options
in this space. Such platforms use their nontraditional designs (the
result of not having a crew) to offer unique capabilities in the ASW
mission. [They are also tremendously difficult for adversaries to
counter due to their low acoustic and optical profiles.]{.underline}
Desired Effect: [Investments in afloat PED systems can help with the
creation of a truly integrated multidomain, multiplatform ASW
complex.]{.underline} USVs, like their cousins in other domains, may
provide novel capabilities and significant capacity at lower costs than
a comparable manned system. **[This increased capacity may be an
operational necessity given advances in submarine
quieting]{.underline}**.

Much has already been achieved in terms of new structures, new
initiatives and new policy developments to support the collaborative
adoption of AI among NATO Allies and EU member states. In addition to
pre-existing structures and mechanisms at both the NATO and EU levels,
which have ensured that nations are not starting from scratch,
**[national defence institutions are already able to refer to common
policy commitments and to options, whether through NATO or the EDA, for
research or capability-development activities]{.underline}**. **[At the

whole-of-government effort which requires considerable cross-over
between the military and civilian realms]{.underline}**. **[Large gaps
remain between the US and the EU on certain key
indicators]{.underline}**. At the same time, the gaps pertaining to
research are far smaller. **[To ensure greater European performance and
relevance in AI in general, and its defence applications in particular,
it seems desirable to focus on]{.underline}** two strategic priorities:
investment volumes, both public and private, which need to be
significantly increased; **[and the full use of collaborative mechanisms
involving the US]{.underline}**. To that end, **[it would be beneficial
for nations on both sides of the Atlantic to ensure that a clear and

should prioritise efforts that complement and enhance transatlantic
approaches, in recognition of the reality that the US remains the
