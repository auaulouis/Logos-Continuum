warrants you need

No IL Notes: These cards basically say 2 things for the aff

1.  Greece aggression is not about politics or trying to win an election

2.  Greece aggression will persist past Erdogan

You wont want to run these cards if you have a cohesion advantage
because they could cross apply them to solvency unless you have evidence
saying turkey is on board with the aff or that cohesion will solve those
conflicts -- use at your own risk

NATO Checks Notes: This card is old but don't let the other team tell
you off because of that -- this card has really good warrants, so make
sure to utilize them in round

This card basically says institutional liberalism is true and (to some
level) realism is false so make sure that fits into your 1ac strategy --
or don't I'm not the boss of you

Diversionary Peace Notes: Notes: These cards also majorly feed into

[The tables have turned for regional
rivals [Greece](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/greece/) and [Turkey](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/turkey/) in
the realm of fighter jet acquisition plans, with [Greece headed for a
buy of]{.mark} [the]{.mark} Lockheed Martin [F-35]{.mark} just three
years after Turkey was kicked out of the [Joint Strike Fighter
program.](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/f-35-joint-strike-fighter/)]{.underline}

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told reporters on June 30 that
the country had submitted a letter of request "in recent days" to the US
government for a squadron of 20 F-35s, with options to buy an additional
squadron,[ the Associated Press
reported. ](https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/2022-06-30/greece-requests-f35-fighter-jets-6510677.html)

The Greek announcement came just a day after[ President Joe
Biden](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/joe-biden/) said that the United
States "should sell" F-16s to Turkey --- a statement that was heralded
as a breakthrough after Turkey's purchase of the Russian S-400 air
defense system in 2019 stymied US arms sales to Turkey and [got it
booted from the F-35
program](https://breakingdefense.com/2020/07/congress-pushes-pentagon-to-finally-kick-turkey-out-of-f-35-program/).

[Three [experts]{.mark} who spoke to Breaking Defense [say]{.mark}
Greece's [purchase of the F-35 is]{.mark} very [likely to be
approved]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} it [could]{.mark} further [drive a
wedge]{.mark} [between]{.mark} the already strained
[relations]{.mark}hip [of]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and Turkey]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"Given the strategic situation in the eastern Mediterranean, a Greek
F-35 purchase is inevitable, particularly with the \[Hellenic Air
Force's\] aging fleet," said Richard Aboulafia, managing director with
Aerodynamic Advisory. "Despite economic challenges, Greece has
prioritized a high level of defense spending. The only challenge is
availability, given the limited F-35 production ramp."

**[[An F-35 sale to Greece could inflame Ankara]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[where [there is **mounting rhetoric that the**]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is]{.mark} [using Greece as a pawn to
control Turkey]{.mark}** and concerns about the deepening relationship
between the two nations]{.underline}, said Nicholas Danforth, senior
visiting fellow at the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign
Policy. [But [that]{.mark} might **[not]{.mark} be [enough to
dissuade]{.mark}** US **[policy makers from]{.mark} [approving the
sale]{.mark},** he added.]{.underline}

"Historically, the United States has placed a huge priority on avoiding
conflict between NATO allies in the eastern Mediterranean. In the past,
that meant trying to maintain a very balanced position between Greece
and Turkey," Danforth said.

"[In time, [as frustration]{.mark} with Turkey has [mounted]{.mark},
[it's]{.mark} become [clear]{.mark} to people in Washington
[that]{.mark} [the]{.mark} real [threat]{.mark} in the region [is
Turkey's]{.mark} provocative [behavior]{.mark}. [There's]{.mark} been a
[declining concern with whether]{.mark} or not [improved cooperation
with Greece will antagonize Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline}. I see a greater
growing conviction that the relationship with Turkey is a lost cause and
that US foreign policy has to do the best it can within that reality."

Meanwhile, [[Athens believes]{.mark} that the [Turkish threat is
real]{.mark}, [and that air superiority is critical]{.mark} for
countering that threat, Danforth said. "Greece is already convinced that
Turkish hostility \[and\] Turkey's malign intentions are baked in and as
a result are probably [less worried about]{.mark} particular steps they
take further [aggravating]{.mark} [Ankara]{.mark}."]{.underline}

A senior Turkish official said the US government didn't bring up the
sale of F-35s to Greece in its recent engagements with Ankara. The
official added his belief that Washington would maintain the diplomatic
and military balance between Turkey and Greece and would take into
account possible instability such sales could trigger in the region.
"This is why we believe Turkey's F-16 request would be fulfilled," the
official said.

The official added that Turkish military experts believe that the F-16
deal would put Turkey on par with the current Greek military --- or even
give air superiority to Ankara. [But if Greece were to get the
[F-35]{.mark}, it [would]{.mark} put [pressure]{.mark} on
[Turkey's]{.mark} homegrown [TF-X project]{.mark} to be successful as a
way of balancing capabilities]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Said the Turkish official: "We would of course criticize the US
government if they give F-35s to Athens. Not only would it change the
military balance, but also because they didn't supply the same system to
us."

No one would go on the record among current Turkish officials to discuss
the potential F-35 sale, but there is a long line of concerns from
retired generals against such a deal. For instance, retired Brig. Gen.
Nejat Eslen  proposed deploying the S-400 against the Greek F-35s in a
2020 interview to Russian state media.

Asked whether Greece actually has a military need for the F-35 or just
wants to get one over on Ankara, Jim Townsend, a former US deputy
assistant secretary of defense for European and NATO policy, said, "It's
both. It is definitely both."

"You need the political hook to get the money, and the military is more
than happy to push for it. They probably think the Turks eventually come
back to F-35, but the Greeks want to say 'we've already been there and
we'll have the leg upon the Turks because they'll only have F-16s, and
we'll be in the next generation.' It's national pride, not necessarily
meeting a specific NATO force goal," he said.

It's possible that a Greek F-35 deal could put pressure on Turkey to
take steps that would allow it to enter back into the F-35 program, said
Townsend, now with the Center for a New American Security. However, "I
don't think the Turks feel threatened by the Greeks," he added. "The
Turks worry more about the PKK."

While it's possible that Turkey could seek to throw a wrench into an
F-35 sale to Greece, the United States could retaliate against Ankara by
blocking Turkey's F-16 buy, Townsend said. "We have some leverage. It's
rare to have leverage over the Turks and I think F-16 is our main
leverage in a lot of ways."

Euros And Sense

While the experts agreed that the US government is likely to approve the
sale, one lingering question yet to be answered is how Greece will
ultimately pay for the F-35. The combined forces of the COVID-19
pandemic and war between Russia and Ukraine have sent the global economy
reeling, with nations in Europe and elsewhere dealing with surging gas
prices, a food shortage, and higher costs due to supply scarcity.

With a unit cost of at least \$78 million per F-35A conventional takeoff
and landing model --- a figure that is expected to increase due to
supply chain pressures --- and notoriously expensive operations and
maintenance costs, paying for multiple F-35 squadrons could be a
challenge for Greece even in the best of times. However, Greece's
economic system has only recently gotten back on its feet after the 2008
financial crisis spurred a series of bailouts.

Ultimately, the country could opt to cut its planned buy if it becomes
too costly or "get a scaled down version" of the plane "like buying a
car without hubcaps," said Townsend.

"Who knows how they eventually afford it? They don't seem to be worried
about borrowing, as a rule," he said. "I think what they do is they make
buying armaments a top priority because they feel this threat from
Turkey, but its also national pride and the ability to show the Turks
they can't take the Greeks for granted. Their economy has gone through
issues with debt, so whether they could buy as many F-35s as they plan
to or buy them at all is a good question."

[Aboulafia said that [Greece]{.mark} could also seek out [used
planes]{.mark} to try to [offset]{.mark} the initial [costs of acquiring
the F-35.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}However, that decision could
result in higher sustainment costs, as it is more expensive to maintain
older, early-model aircraft that may not have been updated with the
latest software and hardware.

**[Non UQ -- Coop Now]{.underline}**

**Turkey already cooperates with the US on security**

**NTI '21** (The Nuclear Threat Initiative is a nonprofit, nonpartisan
global security organization focused on reducing nuclear and biological
threats imperiling humanity., "Turkey Overview,"
<https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/turkey-overview/>) JHK

[As part of NATO's nuclear umbrella, **Turkey continues to host
approximately 50 U.S. tactical nuclear weapons on its territory** at
Incirlik Air Base]{.underline}. 5 While the Cold War-era B61 bombs serve
little military purpose, they provide tangible evidence of a continued
American commitment to Turkish security. There is ongoing debate in the
policy community about whether the United States should continue to
station tactical nuclear weapons in Turkey, given political instability
in Turkey and the wider Middle East. 6 However, [advocates for the
continued presence of **the weapons** argue that, although they **serve
little military purpose, they provide tangible evidence of a continued
American commitment** to Turkish security.]{.underline}

[The **United States plans to upgrade the B61 bombs to the B61-12** and
hopes to complete the process by 2024. 7 Currently, both U.S. aircraft
and some Turkish F16s can carry the B61, however, there is some
speculation over whether Turkey still maintains an operational link with
the B61s on its territory.]{.underline} 8 Additionally, the United
States halted a shipment of F-35 fighter jets to Turkey in 2019 over
Turkey's purchase of a Russian missile defense system. Some of these
jets were slated to be used with U.S. nuclear weapons. 9

Additionally, in September 2019, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan
stated that it was unacceptable for nuclear-armed states to prohibit
Turkey from attaining nuclear weapons. Though he did not say if Turkey
would begin to pursue a nuclear weapons program, Erdogan's statement
fueled calls for the U.S. to remove its nuclear weapons from Turkey and
increased anxieties regarding the development of nuclear power plants in
Turkey. 10

Turkey's interest in civilian nuclear technology dates to at least 1956,
when the government founded the [Turkish Atomic Energy Authority
(TAEK)](https://www.nti.org/facilities/490/), Ankara conducts
sophisticated nuclear fuel cycle research and possesses two
small research reactors. The [TR-2 5MWt
reactor](https://www.nti.org/facilities/495/) is located at the [Cekmece
Nuclear Research Training Center](https://www.nti.org/facilities/496/),
and the ITU TRIGA MARK II is located at [Istanbul Technical
University](https://www.nti.org/facilities/500/). 11

Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's AKP-led government is aggressively
pursuing nuclear energy. While the government's announcement in 2006
that it would install 5,000MW nuclear energy by 2015 (3 reactors) has
not proven feasible, the AKP remains politically committed to the
nuclear power program. 12 After a troubled tender process in 2008, the
government began assessing the sole bid for construction of Turkey's
first nuclear plant at Akkuyu from the Russian-led consortium
Atomstroyexport-Inter Rao-Park Teknik. 13 In May
2010, [Russia](https://www.nti.org/learn/countries/russia/) and Turkey
signed a Cooperation Agreement, under which Rosatom State Cooperation
will construct Akkuyu nuclear power plant. The plant will eventually
contain four reactors with a combined capacity of 4800
MW. 14 Construction is underway on the first unit. 15 Other nuclear
power projects in Sinop and the Thrace region remain in the planning
stages.

Turkey meets approximately 72% of its energy demand through imports, and
thus is actively pursuing nuclear energy to address this dependency. 16

[[Turkey\'s]{.mark} annual [inflation jumped to a two-decade high of

Month-on-month, consumer prices rose 7.25%, the Turkish Statistical

[[Turkey]{.mark} [Establish]{.mark}ing a '[Cyber Army' To
Counter]{.mark} National [Cyber Threats]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The [Turkish government]{.mark} is in preparations to
[establish]{.mark} a [national cyber 'army' that]{.mark} will [tackle
national cyber threats against the country]{.mark}]{.underline},
according to the Turkish Minister for Transportation, Maritime Affairs,
and Communications Ahmet Arslan.

The announcement was made in the [[aftermath of]{.mark} the global
[WannaCry ransomware attack]{.mark} that affected over 300,000 computers
worldwide,]{.underline} but left most of Turkey and the Middle East
largely unaffected due to its weekend timing. [Still, the WannaCry
episode is being seen by policy makers everywhere [as a wake up
call]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"We survived these recent attacks unharmed as a country," said Arslan,
who noted that only one factory in Turkey ceased operations for a day
because it was part of the supply chain of French auto manufacturer
Renault, whose systems were affected by the WannaCry ransomware.

Yet Arslan is not content to have avoided serious damage from the
WannaCry episode, telling Turkish reporters that, "...[[they]{.mark} may
[pose a big]{.mark}ger [threat]{.mark} and danger in the following days.
That's why [we are strengthening the structure]{.mark} all the time.
Some 13,000 white hackers came to work in the public sector. [We are
building a cyber army]{.mark} with five groups]{.underline}."

"We formed centers and teams to intervene in cyber incidents starting
from 2013. We led the way for the formation of these centers and teams
in all institutions, not just the public sector. There is a beautiful
coordination on this issue. We notified the institutions about the
possibility of this recent cyberattack. We said, 'Update your defense
software and antivirus programs.' This was very important," he added.

[The [Turkish government started a recruitment drive]{.mark} in late
2016 [for]{.mark} hundreds of university graduates to work in [cyber
security]{.mark} after a tumultuous year that saw up to 90 million cyber
attacks and exploits targeting Turkish government and private sector
computers and networks]{.underline}.

The recruitment drive is being led by the Turkish government's
Information and Communication Technologies Authority (BTK), and new
recruits can expect to be paid a minimum of 6,000 Turkish Lira
(approximately U.S\$1,700) a month upon joining the BTK. According to
BTK officials, the new cyber security recruits can expect to work on the
frontlines of Turkish national security.

[2016 was a devastating year for Turkish cyber security after the 15
July 2016 attempted [coup]{.mark} that [involved]{.mark} a [large number
of]{.mark} active [measures in cyberspace]{.mark} by both the coup
instigators and by the government of President Erdogan. Additionally,
the [Erdogan]{.mark} government [endured]{.mark} several weeks of

"[We have made the [national]{.mark} artificial intelligence
([Al]{.mark}) [strategy to ensure]{.mark} that the digital

said Musyafa Varank, Minister of Industry and Technology, indicating
that Turkey is one of the few countries to develop such a plan..

"[The artificial intelligence will be an indispensable part of economic
and social fields in the very near future]{.underline}," Varank also
said while explains the plan\'s socio-economic aims.

[The [plan outlines]{.mark}
six [priorities](https://cbddo.gov.tr/uyzs) primarily centered around
supporting Turkey\'s Al initiatives and **[strengthening international
cooperation]{.mark}** in this field by training artificial intelligence
specialists and increasing employment , encouraging research,
entrepreneurship, and innovation, reaching to quality data and technical
infrastructure, and expediting structural and workforce
transformation]{.underline}.

The government would like to commercialise applications developed and
prioritise in public procurement and boost the number of MSc graduates
specialized in AI technology by at least 10,000.

"We will enter the top 20 countries in the international artificial
intelligence indices," Ali Taha Koc, Head of the Digital Transformation
Office of the Turkish Presidency said during the ceremony, highlighting
the importance of becoming an accurate Al data-sharing country.

The strategy forecasts a two-fold increase in market size and global AI
expenditures within five years. It also strives to enhance Turkey\'s
economic and technological independence by reinforcing indigenous
infrastructure and a structural transformation.

Efforts are still ongoing to establish institutions and 'unicorns'
similar to The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey
(TUBITAK) Artificial Intelligence Institute . When compared to the 2,000
US and Chinese startups, the number in Turkey is low at approximately
200 companies.

[The government of Turkey has published the country's National
Artificial Intelligence Strategy for 2021-2025.]{.underline}

[Prepared by the Digital Transformation Office of the Presidency and the
Ministry of Industry and Technology, the strategy hopes to solidify
Turkey\'s artificial intelligence ambitions, and lay the foundation for
a more aggressive investment plan.]{.underline}

Just don't mention the surveillance state

To implement [the new
strategy](https://cbddo.gov.tr/SharedFolderServer/Genel/File/TR-NationalAIStrategy2021-2025.pdf),
the government will establish a National Artificial Intelligence
Strategy Steering Committee, which will help craft national policy on
all things AI.

[The country plans to focus on six strategic priorities -- educating
citizens in AI and increasing employment in the sector; supporting
research activities; entrepreneurship and innovation in the field of AI;
developing access to quality data and technical infrastructure; making
arrangements to \"accelerate socioeconomic adjustment;\" improving
international cooperation; and accelerating structural and workforce
transformation.]{.underline}

By 2025, these six aims (broken into 24 objectives and 119 more specific
measures) are expected to lead to a number of positive outcomes.

The country hopes to increase the contribution of AI to GDP to five
percent -- although it doesn\'t disclose the current level. It also
hopes to boost employment in the field of AI to 50,000 people, with
employment of AI specialists within central and local government public
institutions to reach 1,000 people.

[The number of graduates in the field of AI will be increased by 10,000
within five years. AI applications developed by the local ecosystem will
be prioritized in public sector procurement, and commercialization will
be supported.]{.underline}

[Turkey has promised \"an active contribution\" to the regulatory
studies and standardization processes of international organizations in
the field of **cross-border data sharing with reliable and responsible
AI**]{.underline}**.**

It pledged to launch at least one global initiative in the field of
natural language processing, and at least five spin-offs operating in
the field of AI technologies that will come out of public institutions
and companies.

Finally, the country said that it would become one of the top 20
countries in the rankings of the international AI indices.

\"Taking part in the field of artificial intelligence is not a matter of
choice,\" Turkey\'s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said.

\"Unknowingly, we are transforming from people struggling with nature to

[Turkey\'s new telecommunication satellite was launched]{.underline} on
Sunday by United States aerospace company SpaceX at 6:59 a.m. Turkish
time (3:59 a.m. GMT).

Türksat 5B, which launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in
the U.S. state of Florida, will reach its orbital slot of 42 degrees
East in 164 days. Then, a 45-day test process will begin.

The satellite produced by Airbus and transferred from France to the U.S.
on Nov. 29, is the most powerful Turkish satellite so far and will
increase its Ka-band capacity by over fifteenfold.

[It will be capable of transmitting data at more than 55
gigabits]{.underline}.

[[Türksat
5B](http://www.dailysabah.com/business/tech/turkey-to-launch-turksat-5b-satellite-on-dec-19-from-us) was
produced with contributions from Turkey\'s domestic industry. It is
expected to last more than 35 years and features a next-generation
electric-powered propulsion]{.underline} system. Besides Turkey, the
entire Middle East, Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Mediterranean, North and East
Africa, Nigeria, South Africa and neighboring countries will be covered
by Türksat 5B. In a video message, President Recep Tayyip **[Erdoğan
hailed the launch as another \"moment of pride for Turkey and the
Turkish nation.\"]{.underline}** \"Today, we launched Türksat 5B, the
most powerful and highest-capacity communication satellite of our
country, into space. In this satellite project, we also opted for Space
X\'s Falcon 9 rocket,\" he said.

[Erdoğan also thanked Elon Musk and his company Space X for not bowing
down to \"the blackmail and pressure of the anti-Turkey
lobbies.\"]{.underline} [Erdoğan held a video call on Thursday with
Musk](https://www.dailysabah.com/business/tech/erdogan-thanks-musk-with-nft-for-helping-with-satellite-launch),
the founder of Space X, and discussed the launch process.

[Underlining that data transmission speed and capacity would see an over
fifteenfold increase with the launch of Türksat 5B, the Turkish
president added: \"In this way, broadband satellite internet services
will be provided to users within the coverage area, including on land,
sea and air vehicles in regions where internet access is
limited]{.underline}.\"

Deputy Minister of Transport and Infrastructure Ömer Fatih Sayan
meanwhile stated that Türksat 5B differs from other satellites with its
high internet capacity, adding that every single Turkish village will
have access to the internet in the coming period.

[Explaining that satellites are primarily used for broadcasting in the
media and television industry, Sayan said that the sector is now
shifting from broadcasting to providing internet services]{.underline}.

Sayan also commented on the expansive area Türksat 5B will cover, noting
that the satellite will cater to a large part of Africa and almost the
entire Mediterranean as well as Turkey.

In addition to providing broadcasting and internet services to the
regions, Sayan noted that "As of today, the internet of our nearly 2,000
village schools is provided by Türksat. With Türksat 5B, we will use our
Türksat satellites much more effectively in order not to leave villages
without internet in Turkey."

Sayan added that the satellite, which took over three years to produce,
will be in service for 30-35 years.

Head of the Presidency\'s Digital Transformation Office Ali Taha Koç
commented on the domestically produced parts in the satellite, stating
that a transceiver system produced by Turkish defense giant Aselsan is
being sent into space over Türksat 5B and will be used in space for the
first time.

["Most of the satellites we have sent so far have been low-orbit
satellites, but for the first time, a domestic product has been tested
at a high orbit distance of 36,000 kilometers (22,369.36 miles), it has
passed all the criteria and is now above Türksat 5B]{.underline}," he
said.

"Aselsan's product will now go down in history," Koç said, adding that
the local product will be available to other countries when building
satellites from now on.

"We took a risk here to support domestic and national production.
Currently, these products have not been used in any satellite," he said.

[The construction of the domestic communication satellite Türksat 6A,
one of Turkey\'s most important projects, is also proceeding at full
speed]{.underline}. The sub-systems, satellite ground station and
software to be used in the satellite are being developed entirely with
domestic means.

While the engineering model equipment and system production of Türksat
6A is completed, system level tests continue at the Satellite Systems
Integration and Test Center.

After the system level tests of the engineering model are completed,
flight model integration and tests will continue. [The Türksat 6A
communication satellite is expected to be launched into space in
2023.]{.underline}

Another one of Turkey\'s satellites, [Turksat
5A](http://www.dailysabah.com/business/tech/turksat-5a-comes-online-to-secure-turkeys-orbital-rights-for-35-years),

Naval Forces Command within five to six months.]{.underline}

Speaking at a ceremony for the docking of the Hızır Reis submarine and
the first welding of the Selman Reis submarine at Gölcük Shipyard
Command in northwestern Kocaeli province, [the president said Turkey
aims to take into service a new domestically made submarine each year,
to ensure that the navy has six new submarines by 2027.]{.underline}

\"[Our submarines, which weigh 1,856 tons above water and 2,042 tons
when submerged, can go to a depth of more than 300 meters. Our
submarines, which can operate for three days underwater, can stay in
water for 12 weeks without the need for resupply. The submarines, which
are equipped with effective weapons against underwater, surface and land
targets, have the ability to launch various types of torpedoes,
missiles, and mines. We are also integrating our national torpedo Akya
and our national anti-ship missile Atmaca into our submarines with
air-independent propulsion capability,]{.underline}" Erdoğan said.

The president added that the Hızır Reis submarine will be put into
service in 2023 and the Selman Reis in 2027.

"Starting from this year, we will put one of our submarines into service
every year, and we will add six new type submarines to our navy until
2027.\"

\"We have realized many projects that will render our navy stronger and
more deterrent for the security of the Blue Homeland,\" Erdoğan added.

\"[Nearly 30 domestic companies of ours have assumed responsibility in
this critical project with their designs and productions for submarine
platforms and underwater technology]{.underline}. Moreover, many other
companies of ours are contributing as subcontractors to the production
process of our submarines. I thank on behalf of myself and my nation all
who have contributed to the production of these submarines that will add
to our strength in seas,\" the president said.

Erdoğan also highlighted the recent boost in Turkey\'s defense industry,
saying that the reliance on external sources has been minimized.

\"[While the foreign dependency in the defense industry was 80% when we
took office, we have today reached a domestic and national production
rate of over 70%. We are currently carrying out more than 750 defense
industry projects half of which we have launched in the past five
years]{.underline}. We have realized many projects that will render our
navy stronger and more deterrent for the security of the Blue
Homeland,\" he added.

domestically designed submarine, MILGEM, which is expected to be built
with mostly domestically developed systems also continues. \"We will
begin building the MILGEM in 2025 in Gölcük Shipyard,\" he said.

The MILGEM (National Ship) marine platforms project is a Turkish warship
program that aims to develop multipurpose corvettes and frigates that
can be deployed in a range of missions.

But [war could still be much **less likely**]{.underline}. The
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Barry [Posen]{.underline} has already considered the likely impact of
the current pandemic on the probability of war, and
he [believes]{.underline}  [COVID-19 is more likely to promote peace
instead]{.underline}. He argues that [the current
pandemic]{.underline} is affecting all the major powers adversely, which
means it [isn't creating tempting windows of opportunity for unaffected
states while leaving others weaker and therefore
vulnerable]{.underline}. Instead[, it is making
all]{.underline} **[governments more pessimistic]{.underline}** [about
their short- to medium-term prospects]{.underline}. Because [states
often go to war out of sense of overconfidence]{.underline} (however
misplaced it sometimes turns out to be), [pandemic-induced pessimism
should be]{.underline} **[conducive to peace]{.underline}**.

Moreover, [by its very nature war requires states to assemble lots of
people in]{.underline} **[close proximity]{.underline}**---at training
camps, military bases, mobilization areas, ships at sea,
etc.---and [that's not something you want to do in the middle of a
pandemic]{.underline}. For the moment at least, beleaguered governments
of all types are focusing on convincing their citizens they are doing
everything in their power to protect the public from the disease. Taken
together, [these considerations might explain why even an impulsive and
headstrong warmaker like Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman has gotten
more interested in winding down his brutal and unsuccessful military
campaign]{.underline} in Yemen.

Posen adds that [COVID-19 is also likely to]{.underline} **[reduce
international trade]{.underline}** in the short to medium term. Those
who believe economic interdependence is a powerful barrier to war might
be alarmed by this development, but he points out that [trade issues
have been]{.underline} a source of considerable friction [in recent
years---especially between the United States and China---and a degree of
decoupling might]{.underline} **[reduce
tensions]{.underline}** [somewhat]{.underline} [and cause
the]{.underline} [odds of war to recede]{.underline}.

For these reasons, [the pandemic itself may be]{.underline} **[conducive
to peace]{.underline}**. [But what about the relationship between
broader economic conditions and the likelihood of war]{.underline}?
Might a few leaders still convince themselves that provoking a crisis
and going to war could still advance either long-term national interests
or their own political fortunes? Are the other paths by which a deep and
sustained economic downturn might make serious global conflict more
likely?

One familiar argument is [the so-called]{.underline}
[diversionary]{.underline} (or "scapegoat") [theory]{.underline} [of
war]{.underline}. It suggests that leaders who are worried about their
popularity at home will try to divert attention from their failures by
provoking a crisis with a foreign power and maybe even using force
against it. Drawing on this logic, some Americans now worry that
President Donald Trump will decide to attack a country like Iran or
Venezuela in the run-up to the presidential election and especially if
he thinks he's likely to lose.

[This outcome]{.underline} [strikes me as unlikely]{.underline}, even if
one ignores the logical and empirical flaws in the theory itself. [War
is always]{.underline} [a gamble, and should things go badly---even a
little bit---it would]{.underline} **[hammer the last
nail]{.underline}** [in the coffin]{.underline} of Trump's declining
fortunes. Moreover, [none of the countries]{.underline} Trump might
consider going after [pose an]{.underline} **[imminent
threat]{.underline}** [to U.S. security]{.underline}, and even his
staunchest supporters may wonder why he is wasting time and money going
after Iran or Venezuela at a moment when thousands of Americans are
dying preventable deaths at home. [Even a successful military action
won't put Americans back to work, create the sort of testing-and-tracing
regime that competent governments around the world have been able to
implement already]{.underline}, or hasten the development of a vaccine.
The [same]{.underline} logic [is likely to]{.underline} guide **[the
decisions of]{.underline}** **[other world leaders too]{.underline}**.

**[No Internal Link -- Diversionary War False]{.underline}**

**No diversionary war**

**Boehmer '7** -- political science professor at the University of Texas
\[

Charles, Politics & Policy, 35:4, "The Effects of Economic Crisis,
Domestic Discord, and State Efficacy on the Decision to Initiate
Interstate Conflict", WEA\]

This article examines the contemporaneous effect of low economic growth
and domestic instability on the threat of regime change and/ or
involvement in external militarized conflicts. Many [studies of
diversionary conflict argue that lower]{.underline} rates of
economic [growth should heighten the risk of international
conflict]{.underline}. Yet we know that militarized interstate
conflicts, and especially wars, are generally rare events whereas lower
rates of growth are not. Additionally, a growing body of literature
shows that regime changes are also associated with lower rates of
economic growth. The question then becomes which event, militarized
interstate conflict or regime change, is the most likely to occur with
domestic discord and lower rates of economic growth? [Diversionary
theory claims that leaders seek to divert attention away from domestic
problems such as a bad economy]{.underline} or political scandals, or to
garner increased support prior to elections. Leaders then supposedly
externalize discontented domestic sentiments onto other nations,
sometimes as scapegoats based on the similar in-group/out-group dynamic
found in the research of Coser (1956) and Simmel (1955), where foreign
countries are blamed for domestic problems. This process is said to
involve a "rally-round-the-flag" effect, where a leader can expect a
short-term boost in popularity with the threat or use of force
(Blechman, Kaplan, and Hall 1978; Mueller 1973). Scholarship on
diversionary conflict has focused most often on the American case1 but
recent studies have sought to identify this possible behavior in other
countries.2 The Falklands War is often a popular example of diversionary
conflict (Levy and Vakili 1992). Argentina was reeling from
hyperinflation and rampant unemployment associated with the Latin
American debt crisis. It is plausible that a success in the Falklands
War may have helped to rally support for the governing Galtieri regime,
although Argentina lost the war and the ruling regime lost power. How
many other attempts to use diversionary tactics, if they indeed occur,
can be seen to generate a similar outcome? The goal of this article is
to provide an assessment of the extent to which diversionary strategy is
a threat to peace. [Is this a colorful theory kept alive by academics
that has little bearing upon real events]{.underline}, or is this a real
problem that policy makers should be concerned with? If it is a strategy
readily available to leaders, then it is important to know what domestic
factors trigger this gambit. Moreover, to know that requires an
understanding of the context in external conflict, which occurs relative
to regime changes. [Theories of diversionary
conflict]{.underline} [usually]{.underline} [emphasize]{.underline} [the
potential]{.underline} [benefits]{.underline} [of diversionary tactics,
although]{.underline} [few
pay]{.underline} [equal]{.underline} [attention to]{.underline} [the
prospective]{.underline} [costs]{.underline} associated with such
behavior. It is not contentious to claim that leaders typically seek to
remain in office. However, [whether they can successfully manipulate
public opinion]{.underline} regularly during periods of domestic
unpopularity [through]{.underline} their states' participation in
foreign militarized [conflicts]{.underline}---especially outside of the
American case---[is]{.underline} a question [open for
debate]{.underline}. Furthermore, there appears to be a logical
disconnect between diversionary theories and extant studies of domestic
conflict and regime change. Lower rates of economic growth are purported
to increase the risk of both militarized interstate conflicts (and
internal conflicts) as well as regime changes (Bloomberg and Hess 2002).
This implies that [if leaders]{.underline} [do]{.underline}, in
fact, [undertake diversionary conflicts, many may still be thrown
from]{.underline} the seat of [power---especially if the outcome is
defeat]{.underline} to a foreign enemy. Diversionary conflict would thus
seem to be a risky gambit (Smith 1996). [Scholars]{.underline} such as
MacFie (1938) and Blainey
(1988) [have]{.underline} nevertheless [questioned the validity
of]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [diversionary]{.underline} [thesis]{.underline}.
As noted by Levy (1989), this perspective [is rarely formulated as a
cohesive]{.underline} and comprehensive [theory]{.underline}, and there
has been little or no knowledge cumulation. Later analyses do not
necessarily build on past studies and the discrepancies between
inquiries are often difficult to unravel. "[Studies have used a variety
of research designs]{.underline}, different dependent variables (uses of
force, major uses of force, militarized disputes), different estimation
techniques, [and different data sets]{.underline} covering different
time periods and different states" (Bennett and Nordstrom 2000, 39). To
these problems, we should add a lack of theoretical precision and
incomplete model specification. By a lack of theoretical precision, I am
referring to the linkages between economic conditions and domestic
strife that remain unclear in some studies (Miller 1995; Russett 1990).
Consequently, extant studies are to a degree incommensurate; they offer
a step in the right direction but do not provide robust cross-national
explanations and tests of economic growth and interstate conflict. Yet a
few studies have attempted to provide deductive explanations about when
and how diversionary tactics might be employed. Using a Bayesian
updating game, Richards and others (1993) theorize that while the use of
force would appear to offer leaders a means to boost their popularity, a
poorly performing economy acts as a signal to a leader's constituents
about his or her competence. Hence, [attempts to use
diversion]{.underline} [are likely
to]{.underline} [fail]{.underline} [either]{.underline} [because
incompetent leaders]{.underline} [will likewise]{.underline} [fail in
foreign policy or people]{.underline} [will]{.underline} [recognize the
gambit]{.underline} [for what it is]{.underline}. Instead, these two
models conclude that diversion is likely to be undertaken particularly
by risk-acceptant leaders. This stress on a heightened risk of removal
from office is also apparent in the work of Bueno de Mesquita and others
(1999), and Downs and Rocke (1994), where leaders may "gamble for
resurrection," although the diversionary scenario in the former study is
only a partial extension of their theory on selectorates, winning
coalitions, and leader survival. Again, how often do leaders fail in the
process or are removed from positions of power before they can even
initiate diversionary tactics? A few studies focusing on leader tenure
have examined the removal of leaders following war, although almost no
study in the diversionary literature has looked at the effects of
domestic problems on the relative risks of regime change, interstate
conflict, or both events occurring in the same year.3

the citizens\' attention away from the politically unpopular domestic
situation, thus making sure they stay in office. The breakout of a large
number of conflicts in history, from the Middle Ages to modern times,
has been explained in terms of diversionary use of force. The actions of
Napoleon III have been interpreted as frequent uses of diversionary
tactics: not only did the Emperor provoke the Crimean war (1852-1856) to
"divert the eyes of Frenchmen from their own government\'s weaknesses"
(Blainey, 1988:72), but also the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 has been
interpreted in the same way. Perhaps the most well-known example is the
RussoJapanese war of 1904. The Russian Interior Minister at that time,
Plehve, is cited in the memoirs of Count Witte, Minister of Finance, as
saying "you are not familiar with Russia\'s internal situation. We need
a little victorious war to stem the tide of revolution" (Blainey,
1988:76). [The theory has been]{.underline} widely supported and is
a [long-lived]{.underline} one, appearing long before the established
scholarly field of International Relations. Historically, it has been a
conventional wisdom on the outbreak of war, based upon a number of ad
hoc observations rather than a well-established theoretical scientific
hypothesis. As Morgan and Bickers put it: "virtually every war since
1800 has been attributed, at least in part, to efforts of state leaders
to deal with domestic problems" (Morgan and Bickers, 1992:27). However,
throughout the years, this enigma has become widely researched by
political scientists, resulting in a more developed theory. What
theoretical arguments do the advocates of the Diversionary War theory
rely upon? In summary, the main mechanisms of the DWT have said to be
three: The In-group/Out-grouphypothesis or Rally-Round-The-Flag-Effect,
Scapegoating and Gambling for Resurrection (Chiozza and Goemans,
2003:445). The first one, the In-group/Out-group theory, or
conflict-cohesion theory, originates from the field of sociology and the
two sociologists Simmel and Coser. It suggests that identities of a
group, in this case national identities, become stronger in times of
external threats -- that the in-group identity becomes more united
during conflicts with the out-group (Levy, 1989:261). The
Rally-Round-The-FlagEffect is a consequence of this. Not only does
external pressure strengthen the group identities -- in addition, it
also leads to the group\'s unification around leader. The tenure of the
leader should therefore be extended in times of external crisis (Chiozza
and Goemans, 2003:445). However, for the theory to be effective, there
are some conditions that should be met: the group has to be fairly
salient to begin with, has to already perceive itself as a group and
also view the survival of the group as something worthwhile (Levy
1989:261). In addition, Simmel recognized that the outcome of conflict
might be of importance: "\[War\] might either cause domestic quarrels to
be forgotten, or might on the contrary aggravate them beyond
reconciliation" (Levy, 1989:261). The second mechanism, Scapegoating,
means that leaders retort to war to shift the blame of failed policies
onto the states enemies (Chiozza and Goemans, 2003:445). This is a
consequence of the first theory, implying that leaders are aware of the
psychological effect external pressure has on national identity and, in
turn, their own tenure. The third mechanism, Gambling for resurrection,
stemming from rational choice literature, argues that state leaders who
are confronted with a possible loss of power can afford starting a
foreign conflict, since their risk of losing office is imminent. If
creating a conflict increases their chance of staying in office even by
a small percentage, it would be worth it (Chiozza and Goemans,
2003:446). Consequently, we should be able to observe the following
patterns or mechanisms, according to the theory: When a domestic issue
in a state threatens the legitimacy or political power of the ruling
elite, said elite should a) be likely to use aggressive foreign policy
behaviour as a tool to divert the attention of the public from the
domestic issue, since a) the leaders are aware that the people will
become more united or nationalistic under such external pressure, b) the
people will give more support to the leader leading to c), a return of
the popular support of the political elite. [However]{.underline}, as
already touched upon in the introduction, [most of the research in
support of the]{.underline} [DWT have
been]{.underline} [either]{.underline} **[backed up by anecdotal
evidence]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[lack quantitative
evidence]{.underline}**, [which]{.underline} [leads
to]{.underline} [both]{.underline} [**theoretical and empirical
issues**.]{.underline} 3.2 The Critiques of Diversionary War Theory [The
Diversionary War theory has been]{.underline} **[heavily
criticized]{.underline}** throughout the years.
Only **[few]{.underline}** modern **[scholars]{.underline}** working on
the subject [ultimately]{.underline} **[support the initial
theory]{.underline}**. The main critique against the DWT is that [there
are]{.underline} **[insignificant links]{.underline}** [between the
theory and the empirical findings]{.underline} (Levy, 1989:282). [The
historical and theoretical literature strongly suggests that political
leaders should use diversionary force to strengthen their own positions,
while]{.underline} the **[empirical studies, often
quantitative]{.underline}**, [have found]{.underline} little or **[no
support for the relationship]{.underline}** between domestic strife and
foreign conflict. The reasons for this are, in summary, two: 1. There
might be something wrong with the theory itself. 2. The methodology used
(mostly statistical analysis of a large number of states) might not be
the right one (Morgan and Bickers, 1992:28). Regarding the theory, [the
idea that external enemies unite the group]{.underline} **[might not
be]{.underline}** as **[strong]{.underline}** as initially thought. As
Simmel himself explained, [the in-group/out-group theory
needs]{.underline} **[strict]{.underline}** **[conditions]{.underline}** to
work -- [one of them is the in-group being fairly
small]{.underline}. [Thus,]{.underline} **[extrapolating]{.underline}** the
concept from small group psychological behaviour [into]{.underline} [a
large, complex entity as modern
day]{.underline} [states]{.underline} [might
be]{.underline} **[difficult]{.underline}** (Morgan and Bickers
1992:32). Although commonly treated almost as a general law, some
scholars have paid attention to under what circumstances diversionary
tactics would be used. The level of internal conflict should matter for
the use of diversionary tactics. [If the]{.underline} [level of internal
conflict]{.underline} [is]{.underline} too [low]{.underline}, [aggressive
foreign policy should be an exaggerated tool]{.underline} to use. [If
the level]{.underline} of internal conflict
instead [is]{.underline} too [high]{.underline}, [it
would]{.underline} [not]{.underline} [be]{.underline} [wise to turn to
diversionary]{.underline} [tactics]{.underline}. Blainey noted that
during open civil war, [diversionary]{.underline} use of [force is rare
since]{.underline} [states]{.underline} **[turn
to]{.underline}** **[deal
with]{.underline}** **[their]{.underline}** **[internal
issue]{.underline}** **[first]{.underline}** [as a]{.underline} [part
of]{.underline} [its]{.underline} **[rational
calculations]{.underline}** (Blainey, 1988:86). In conclusion, we should
only be able to observe diversionary actions at the moderate levels of
internal strife. Another issue with the Diversionary War theory has to
do with the assumptions that it makes regarding the management of
conflict (or war). It presumes that war is something that can be easily
managed. However, [war requires a]{.underline} **[warring
opponent]{.underline}** [who]{.underline} the [state
leaders]{.underline} **[cannot control]{.underline}**. [The situation is
very likely to]{.underline} **[get out of hand]{.underline}** and
therefore [open]{.underline} [conflict]{.underline} [should]{.underline} [probably
be an]{.underline} **[unlikely goal]{.underline}** **[for
leaders]{.underline}** who seek to divert the attention of the public.
Thus, actions short of war, like escalation of threat of force should be
observable (Morgan and Bickers, 1992:29). However, this has also been
challenged. Rummel, conducting a study on the link between internal and
external conflict upon 77 states between 1955-57 found that "foreign
conflict behavior is generally completely unrelated to domestic conflict
behavior" (Levy 1989:262). These two facts about the variables give us
some clue to why the quantitative studies that have been conducted might
fail to produce any results in favor of the DWT. Large scale studies of
the relationship between domestic strife and foreign conflict using
correlation analysis and regressions all rely on the assumption that the
relationship between the variables should be linear. The problem is that
the theory does not imply that this is the case. Rather, the
relationship should differ depending on the level of internal strife.
There are more clues as to why the large, statistical analyses have
failed to produce any results. One reason could be that scholars mainly
have focused on correlations rather than offering any explanations
through causality. One such scholar is Blainey. In his observations, he
finds support for the linkage between civil strife and foreign conflict,
but not due to diversionary actions. Instead, a state torn by civil
strife often end up in conflict because it is perceived as weakened, and
thus easily become a target for other states seeking to exploit the
shift in power balance (Blainey 1988:82). It has also been argued that
the direction of the relationship between internal and external conflict
could be reversed. Foreign conflict could easily lead to internal
turmoil and finally revolution at the home front, giving us
internalization of external conflict rather than externalization of
internal conflict (Levy, 1989:267). However, that this could happen
would not per se be a problem for the theory -- it is only problematic
when the direction of the relationship is unaccounted for, given that
there probably should be different casual mechanisms active during
externalization and internalization of conflict, which would affect the
results. In summary, the biggest obstacle to the research is a common,
cumulative theoretical framework. As Levy puts it: "Little attention is
given to questions of under what kinds of conditions what kind of states
resort to what kinds of external conflict in response to what kinds of
threats to the security of political elites" (Levy, 1989:283). 3.3
Diversionary Peace Theory [The]{.underline} **[Diversionary Peace
Theory]{.underline}**, as put forward by Fravel [is
an]{.underline} **[alternative critical
engagement]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} the **[Diversionary War
Theory]{.underline}**. [In a case study
on]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[its]{.underline}** **[territorial
disputes]{.underline}**, he finds that [in times
of]{.underline} **[internal turmoil]{.underline}** **[or regime
insecurity]{.underline}**, [China
seeks]{.underline} **[compromises]{.underline}** with foreign
states, **[rather than confrontation]{.underline}** (Fravel, 2005:47).
Internal or domestic turmoil is referred to as regime insecurity. Fravel
specifically dwells on social discontent, such
as **[protests]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[legitimacy
crises,]{.underline}** and ethnic violence or uprisings. His
observations are that when China is in a state of regime insecurity, the
state [choose]{.underline}s **[not to escalate]{.underline}** any of
the **[territorial
conflicts]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} the [neighbouring
states]{.underline}. [Instead,]{.underline} [China
seeks]{.underline} **[cooperation]{.underline}**, **[contrary]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}** what
the **[DWT]{.underline}** predicts. [Instead of diversion,
good]{.underline} [relations]{.underline} [with]{.underline} [foreign
state is]{.underline} **[one key way to]{.underline}** **[solve internal
problems]{.underline}**, in addition to domestic tools. [This
is]{.underline} [connected to the theoretical concept of
Omnibalancing]{.underline} (David, 1991:235), [which
explains]{.underline} [that leaders of third-world countries would be
inclined to cooperate with an adversary, if]{.underline} [there is an
enemy deemed as more threatening.]{.underline} There are several
ways [leaders]{.underline} could [benefit from cooperating with other
states to deal with]{.underline} [regime insecurity:
they]{.underline} can [gain]{.underline} **[direct]{.underline}** **[assistance]{.underline}** in
dealing with the domestic threat, such as an external state denying
rebel groups a harbor, as in Syria harboring Öcalan in our case, or they
can improve border patrols. [They]{.underline} can **[avoid a costly
two-front
war]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[focus]{.underline}** their
resources **[on the domestic issues]{.underline}** [instead of the
defense budget. Cooperation could also lead to an improvement of the
regimes\']{.underline} **[international
recognition]{.underline}**, [which
would]{.underline} **[delegitimize]{.underline}** any **[domestic
contestors]{.underline}** (Fravel, 2005:52). According to Fravel,
leaders have three strategy options in ongoing disputes: they can delay,
i.e. maintain claims to the issue, escalate via threat or use of force,
and finally cooperate by dropping claims or offering concessions
(Fravel, 2005:52). The least costly alternative is the delaying
strategy, whereas escalation is costly due to risk of ending up in a
military defeat, and cooperation is costly since it can be perceived as
weakness by domestic audiences and lead to a removal from office.
However, his argument is that [when facing regime
insecurity,]{.underline} [the cost
of]{.underline} the [cooperation]{.underline} strategy [is]{.underline} **[significantly
lowered]{.underline}**, [since whatever one might lose
on]{.underline} [domestic discontent is]{.underline} **[won
through]{.underline}** the **[assistance]{.underline}** in dealing with
the original threat (Fravel, 2005:53). This
is **[especially]{.underline}** true [if the threat to the regime
emerges in the form of a threat to]{.underline} [territorial integrity,
which would]{.underline} **[drastically
enhance]{.underline}** the **[incentives to offer
concessions]{.underline}** to the neighbouring countries to prevent them
from aiding events such as uprisings (Fravel 2005:53). This has clear
implications for our case. When the armed Kurdish struggle for
independence (i.e. a threat to territorial integrity) escalates, Turkey
would have strong incentives to cooperate with or give concessions to
Syria, an adjacent state that could serve as a base for the rebels.
Fravel mainly studies behavior in territorial issues as the main
independent variable. In this study, I will broaden this framework and
include other contested foreign policy issues as well as long as there
is a bargain situation for the two related states where concessions can
be made. Although he backs his claims by an empirical study, only some
attempt is made by Fravel to theoreticize his findings. He claims it [is
a "**counterintuitive**]{.underline} argument about the effects of
domestic conflict on foreign policy" (Fravel, 2005:49). He does
elaborate on why states would chose to cooperate, but does not offer any
deeper explanation of the intervening variables in action. However, [we
can draw]{.underline} some **[theoretical
conclusions]{.underline}** from Fravel\'s observations and thoughts.
First, we assume that leaders are rational. They would, in times of a
crisis, assess the problem, identify possible courses of action and then
choose the alternative that is most effective. By assuming this, we can
draw the conclusion that leaders do not engage in a new conflict simply
because the conflict is not manageable. The logic of the DWT is that
leaders can control new conflicts -- otherwise they would not be able to
initiate them in order to divert attention. For Fravel, in
contrast, [leaders choose to focus
on]{.underline} **[what]{.underline}** **[they
can]{.underline}** **[control]{.underline}**, [which leads
to]{.underline} **[cooperation rather than war]{.underline}**. Secondly,
we can assume that conflict is
costly. [The]{.underline} [resources]{.underline} [of the state might
be]{.underline} **[too scarce to
manage]{.underline}** **[two]{.underline}** **[crises]{.underline}**. [Therefore,]{.underline} [it
is]{.underline} **[not rational to engage in a new, foreign conflict
before the domestic one is solved.]{.underline}**

The Turkish government is using the Russian invasion of Ukraine to
settle [outstanding
grievances](https://www.reuters.com/world/erdogan-says-nato-should-understand-turkeys-security-sensitivities-2022-05-18/) with
much of NATO. Sweden and Finland were expected to [swiftly join the
alliance](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-says-all-ready-quick-ratification-finnish-swedish-nato-membership-2022-05-15/),
in time for the June summit in Madrid. Instead, Ankara has upended this
coronation. Turkey, which joined NATO during the alliance's [first wave
of
enlargement](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49212.htm) in
1952, seeks to [extract concessions](https://t.co/Sc2SdG6RtD) from
Sweden and Finland on combatting terrorism, extraditing citizens of
Kurdish origin to Turkey, and lifting the arms embargo that much of the
West placed on Turkey following its October 2019 invasion of Syria. The
Turkish protests have underscored how Ankara's narrow security concerns
differ considerably from those of the rest of the NATO alliance,
particularly at a time when the alliance has sought to move beyond the
war in Afghanistan and return to its core mission of deterring Russia.

The topic of Turkey has polarized debate in many Western capitals. [The
debate centers on Ankara's value to the alliance, and whether Turkey's
domestic authoritarianism and functional relationship with Moscow matter
for Western security.]{.underline} For Turkey skeptics, [the
argument](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/world/europe/turkey-nato.html) is
that Ankara has upended Western efforts in Syria, and that its tight
trading relationship with Russia and refusal to join with Western
sanctions to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine suggest that
Turkey undermines NATO security. For proponents, Turkey's large,
conscript-heavy military is seen as vital for tying up Russian forces in
a theoretical conventional conflict, and its [sale of TB2
drones](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/05/16/the-turkish-drone-that-changed-the-nature-of-warfare) to
Ukraine is proof-positive of Ankara's constructive role in NATO and
contribution to [deterring Russian
expansionism](https://twitter.com/yusuferim34/status/1402177441964122114?s=24). 

In these debates,
[Ankara's [sympathizers](https://twitter.com/sinanulgen1/status/1527399508425990145) often
focus on the legitimacy of Turkey's concerns,
while [critics](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-syria-middle-east-recep-tayyip-erdogan-4386d1ae4dd72a1bcf2e26f0710987e6?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP_Europe&utm_campaign=SocialFlow) emphasize
that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is blackmailing the West to win
nationalist votes at home. But both of these arguments miss a deeper
point. Turkish elites are serious about their security concerns and that
in itself is problem for NATO.]{.underline} [These genuine concerns are
not just framed in anti-Western ways, but **understood** in anti-Western
ways. This means that **Ankara has some legitimate demands,**
particularly on collective support for counter-terrorism]{.underline}.
But when pro-Ankara analysts focus solely on these asks, they overlook
the "poison-pill" demands for democratic countries to limit their own
societies' free speech in ways that are impossible, or to extradite
people without proper evidence. Conversely, by dismissing all of
Erdogan's demands as token efforts to rally his base, Western critics
risk downplaying the seriousness with which the ruling Justice and
Development party in Turkey pursues foreign policy.

The Turkish government is using the threat of non-consensus to try to
force a wider change in how NATO conceptualizes security. [This facet of
Turkish foreign policy has broad support inside the country and the
challenge it presents to Turkish-Western relations **will endure long
past the current impasse over NATO expansion**]{.underline}. The sooner
leaders in Washington and Brussels confronts this fact, the more
effectively they will be able to handle the unmanageable problem it
poses.

The Roots of Ankara's Anger

Erdogan is one of the world's most transparent leaders and uses clear,
blunt language to describe his foreign policy goals. [Despite this, his
frequent criticisms of the United States and the international
order [are often dismissed as
bluster](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/05/23/erdogan-turkey-pkk-election-sweden-finland-nato/),
aimed only at a domestic audience to retain populist
support]{.underline}. To be sure, all foreign crises involving Turkey
have some link to domestic politics, [but dismissing Erdogan's rhetoric
as unserious is a mistake. The security concerns that he and his
officials have bluntly laid out over Swedish and Finnish NATO membership
are widely shared inside Turkey and linked to a whole host of other
issues that have plagued Turkish-Western relations for the past
decade]{.underline}. [These include the way Turkish elites [view their
own national security
situation](https://stockholmcf.org/pew-report-72-percent-of-turks-see-us-as-security-threat/),
their expectations of
"[solidarity](https://www.conversationsix.com/profile/5Jaafs3entsc2Zutf)"
from Western allies, and their suspicion --- shared by the majority of
Turks --- that the United States and NATO are [actually
adversaries](https://eurasiantimes.com/us-israel-biggest-threat-to-turkey-azerbaijan-closet-ally-centre-for-turkish-studies/) instead
of allies.]{.underline}

Many varieties of Turkish nationalists hold [hostile anti-NATO
views](https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/leaving-nato-should-be-on-agenda-mhp-leader-174038) and
an even [smaller
subset](https://www.swp-berlin.org/publications/products/research_papers/2022RP07_EurasianismInTurkey.pdf) view
Moscow as a more suitable ally for Turkey than NATO[. Elements of this
clique view Greece as particularly hostile and believe that the threat
from Athens has grown in recent years because of its [closer
relationship](https://greekreporter.com/2022/05/17/live-greek-pm-mitsotakis-address-u-s-congress/) Washington
and the arms embargoes placed on Turkey]{.underline}. The U.S.-Greek
relationship was consolidated, particularly during the Trump
administration, by [Greece's
openness](https://www.defensenews.com/news/your-military/2022/05/12/greece-to-extend-base-access-deal-with-us-military/) to
hosting American military forces. For Turkey's anti-Western
Eurasianists, the increase in American cooperation with Greece is viewed
as proof of [American encirclement](http://www.apple.com/) of Turkey and
indicative of an American policy of weakening the Turkish armed forces.

As a result, many elites view the country's [military balance vis-à-vis
Greece](https://twitter.com/kozanserkan1/status/1526470346567729152?s=24&t=9Su4Zecj6Jc_FA8udKRCpQ) as
paramount for national security. The focus on maintaining a more capable
military than Athens has direct relevance to Turkey's position on
Swedish and Finnish membership in NATO. The American decision, in this
instance, to kick Turkey out of the F-35 program looms large.
Washington's decision came after years of telegraphing to Turkey that
its purchase of the S-400 air defense system from Russia would lead to
Turkey's removal from the fighter production program and result in
sanctions. Ankara ignored these warnings. The end result was [just what
Washington
signaled](https://warontherocks.com/2021/10/not-a-divorce-but-a-defense-decoupling-whats-next-for-the-u-s-turkish-alliance/) and
Ankara lost its future front-line fighter and now faces [sanctions on
its defense
industry.](https://2017-2021.state.gov/caatsa-section-231-imposition-of-sanctions-on-turkish-presidency-of-defense-industries/index.html) Greece,
in turn, has [pledged to purchase the
F-35](https://greekreporter.com/2022/05/17/greece-buy-us-f-35-after-2028/) and,
importantly, [has received
upgrades](https://www.key.aero/article/aegean-vipers-overview-greeces-major-f-16-upgrade) to
its legacy F-16 fleet. Ankara has requested these same aircraft upgrades
from Washington, but an unofficial arms embargo[ Congress has
imposed](https://www.defensenews.com/breaking-news/2020/08/12/congress-has-secretly-blocked-us-arms-sales-to-turkey-for-nearly-two-years/) since
October 2019 has prevented it. The uncertainty about the future of the
Turkish Air Force --- and the upgrades to the Hellenic Air Force --- has
reinforced concerns inside Ankara about the future balance of forces in
the Aegean and Mediterranean regions.

Thus, even though Turkey has decreased its overall reliance on foreign
suppliers for military equipment, its inability to access certain
higher-end equipment does have an impact on the country's armed forces.
The embargoes also reinforce [paranoid
thinking](https://warontherocks.com/2020/06/blue-homeland-the-heated-politics-behind-turkeys-new-maritime-strategy/) about
the true intent in Washington and reinforces the fictitious narrative
that Washington seeks to hinder Turkish development out of some broader
desire to control elites in Ankara. This also bolsters the broadly held
view that the United States is indirectly killing Turkish troops by
supplying weapons to the Syrian Kurds while, at the same time, denying
them to Turkey.

Ankara has never accepted the Syrian Kurds as a legitimate
anti-terrorist force, and instead has said that using ["one terrorist
group to fight
another](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/1/9/erdogan-us-made-a-serious-mistake-on-syrian-kurdish-ypg-fighters)"
is destined to fail. The Syrian Kurds, Ankara has suggested, will
repress Arabs, who will then seek shelter from Islamic State, thereby
creating a cycle of violence that Ankara will always have to grapple
with. As Washington's relationship with the Syrian Kurds deepened, so
too did Ankara's intransigence over the direction of the war against the
Islamic State. This intransigence eventually led to [unilateral Turkish
military
action](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/turkey-invades-syria-turkish-president-erdogan-announces-military-operation-today-2019-10-09/) intended [to
carve out a 30-kilometer buffer
zone](https://warontherocks.com/2014/12/the-origins-of-turkeys-buffer-zone-in-syria/) along
the entirety of the [Turkish border with
Syria](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/world/middleeast/syria-turkey-erdogan-afrin.html).
This zone was intended to keep the Syrian Kurds away from Turkey's
border and, importantly, to serve as a repository for displaced Syrians,
who Ankara has sought to bar from entering the country since 2015.
However, in each instance, Ankara's unilateral actions prompted [Western
counter-reaction](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/10/30/us-turkey-alliance-in-downward-spiral-as-congress-mulls-sanctions/) with
sanctions and embargoes. These twin issues are, now, the cornerstone of
Ankara's push against Finnish and Swedish membership in NATO.

[Turkey is seeking to rectify what it perceives as an injustice by using
its power to deny consensus in NATO and thereby coerce the alliance to
take its own national security issues more seriously]{.underline}**.
[Ankara is]{.underline}** [doing this with blunt force: threatening to

Sweden and Finland are **not some roundabout way to whip up populist
sentiment**, **or** solely **a reflection of Erdogan trying to split the
opposition before the 2023 elections**. Instead, the **Turkish
position** on its security vulnerabilities **is genuine** and the
slow-rolling of NATO enlargement is seen as a legitimate mechanism to
coerce the alliance to take Turkish concerns more
seriously]{.underline}.

The issue, of course, is that these concerns are unique to Ankara and
not shared by the Western alliance. Instead, Ankara's Kurdish problem is
thought of as an internal, Turkish-only issue that can be resolved with
a [return to a peace
process](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/western-europemediterranean/turkey/turkey-and-pkk-saving-peace-process).
Even while NATO members recognize the brutality of the Kurdistan Workers
Party and its terrorist tactics, they see the group as a product of
Turkey's own democratic failings. Meanwhile, within Turkey, the ruling
party has
ample [support](https://www.americanprogress.org/press/release-cap-poll-shows-deep-ambivalence-turkey-toward-european-union/) for
its hardline policies, even if there are gripes within the country about
how Erdogan conducts foreign policy. The disconnect between Turkey and
its NATO allies may grow in the coming years, given divergences over
national security priorities and Ankara's willingness to use its
position within Western institutions to coerce its allies.

[The Turkish positions over Sweden and Finland are not spur of the
moment, nor are they simply reflective of populist domestic politics.
Instead, what Ankara is seeking to do is to "right" perceived wrongs
that are now nearly a decade old. The challenges in meeting Ankara's
demands are manifest, signaling that even if there is compromise over
this one issue, differences between Turkey and the NATO alliance will
persist]{.underline}. These suggest that managing Turkey will remain a
core issue for NATO for years to come, underscoring how current
challenges may continue to fester even if compromises can be found.

[The best pathway forward for the United States and Europe is to admit
that relations with Ankara are a transactional, interest-driven affair
that requires near-constant effort to manage]{.underline}. Given
Turkey's position within NATO, it literally gets a vote over expansion,
ensuring that Ankara can extract concessions from current and future
aspirants. However, it would be unwise for countries to focus only on
the Turkish demands that it agrees with, without viewing the totality of
Ankara's expectations. [Ankara may be forced to capitulate, but
Erdogan's earnestness when expressing his desires for [global
change](https://www.insightturkey.com/articles/the-world-is-bigger-than-five-a-salutary-manifesto-of-turkeys-new-international-outlook) clearly
indicate that he **will revisit his gripes at a later
date**]{.underline}**,** [when he again feels he has leverage over the
West]{.underline}. This reality should also inform how the West deals
with Turkey: looking for its own opportunities to extract concessions
when it is Ankara that is vulnerable to coercion. This method of
diplomacy is, at its core, how the current leadership in Turkey views
its relations with the world --- as a zero-sum affair. It would behoove
others to get with the program. [It is unclear if Turkish demands of
Sweden and Finland can ever be met, but the demands are serious and part
of a broader worldview that informs Turkey's thinking. It would be wise
to understand the roots of those concerns because, inevitably, **they
will reappear**]{.underline}.

[**Turkey's rejection of NATO accession for Sweden and Finland,** beyond
undercutting NATO's response to Russia's aggression, **reflects a deeper
rift between the West and Turkey**.]{.underline} This is further
manifest by Ankara's recent threat to expand into northern Syria and its
overflights of Greek territory. [For the sake of the Alliance, immediate
responses are vital, but **the rift will worsen unless Washington and
European capitals work** with Ankara **to fundamentally shift their
relationship**.]{.underline} While such a shift has long been advisable
given Turkey's importance, the existential threat of Russian aggression
for both Turkey and the Alliance make it urgent.

Almost overnight Ankara lashed out against Finland and Sweden,
threatening to block their NATO accession if they did not cut real and
alleged ties to the PKK.

A month ago, Washington hosted Turkish Foreign Minister Melvut Cavusoglu
and signaled a new bilateral strategic dialogue. This included possible
sales of F-16's to Ankara, symbolically ending the bitter dispute over a
Turkish Russian missile purchase, and Washington's subsequent cutting
Turkey from the F-35 program. Turkey was also following analogous
rapprochement with Arab states, Israel, Greece, and Armenia, and now
plays a central role in the Ukrainian conflict providing weapons,
closing the Straits to Russian naval reinforcements and pressing on
various diplomatic exchanges. Then almost overnight Ankara lashed out
against Finland and Sweden, threatening to block their NATO accession if
they did not cut real and alleged ties to the PKK, and followed up with
the aforementioned threats in Syria and escalation in the Aegean.
Predictably, American commentators reacted vigorously, even suggesting
once again for Turkey to be thrown out of NATO.

Shifting attitudes toward Turkey

[Such dramatic flips in Turkish policy, gelding any predictable
diplomacy, have become a hallmark of both Turkish president Erdogan and
the convoluted internal political system with his party, dependent on an
extremist nationalist partner. Such flips also make efforts to resolve
issues such as those above (let alone the underlying rift between Ankara
and NATO allies), a high-risk endeavor which most Western leaders avoid,
writing Turkey off as a lost cause. But as Ukraine has demonstrated,
Turkey is vital to containing Russia, as it has been to NATO's nuclear
deterrence, missile defense against Iran, operations in the Balkans, and
Afghanistan. It is just too big, too important, and at times too
problematic to ignore.]{.underline}

While the Ukraine conflict is now generating strife between Turkey and
NATO over Scandinavian accession, it also offers a chance to improve
relations between them. That conflict resembles nothing seen since the
late 1930s and immediate post-war period, with the very survival of the
world order at stake. Winning this conflict, by maintaining Ukraine's
survival as an independent state and deterring new Russian aggression,
while avoiding escalation into the unknown, is a categorical imperative
not experienced since the Cold War. While this is true of the Alliance
as a whole, it is especially relevant for Turkey, a front line state
with a long history under Russian pressure.

[Furthermore, experience shows Turkey can be cooperative.]{.underline}
The Bush administration worked well with Turkey on counter-PKK
operations, and the Obama administration negotiated a NATO anti- Iranian
ballistic missile radar deployment. The 2019 Pence-Erdogan ceasefire in
Northeast Syria still holds despite Turkish threats, and the two
capitals handled well President Biden's acknowledgment of Armenian
genocide. And, ironically, despite deep geostrategic hostility and
recent military clashes, Russia and Turkey maintain productive
presidential-level relations, with Putin and especially Erdogan usually
following a 'no-surprises' principle.

The Turks understand that accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO is
critically important for a positive Ukraine outcome.

The Turks understand that accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO is
critically important for a positive Ukraine outcome. They know it would
strengthen the West's long-term against Russian aggression and underline
the solidarity of the international front against Moscow, without, as
Putin admitted, directly threatening Russia. [But what Ankara may not
get is that its penchant for dangerous haggling, not only over accession
but with its Aegean and northern Syria threats, undercuts that
solidarity and the whole Russia containment categorical imperative.
Turkey would then be blamed and likely ostracized permanently within
NATO. So, the question is, why does it keep running such
risks?]{.underline}

Turkey's risks

Beyond the specific difficulties with President Erdogan and his domestic
political and economic woes, underlying issues stymie cooperation;
although they could be managed if understood better. [**Most immediate
are Turkey's concerns about its 'near abroad' security issues in the
Caucasus, Iraq, Syria, the Aegean, and** Eastern **Mediterranean**
abutting Turkey's access to the world. Above all, Turkey sees the
Kurdish PKK insurgency as an existential threat.]{.underline} While its
terrorism in Turkey has been largely suppressed, it has large bases in
Iraq and Syria, including the PKK offshoot YPG commanding the Syrian
Democratic Forces (SDF) in northeast Syria fighting with US and other
Western support against ISIS.

Turkey understands but cannot politically accept this support to the
SDF, as Ankara fears one day the Americans will leave, and the SDF will
turn on Turkey. [Likewise **it sees Greece asserting legally unjustified
positions in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean as choking off Turkish
access to undersea riches and** eventually even international **air and
sea communications.**]{.underline} Finally it views Armenia as a
hindrance to its alliance with Azerbaijan, with important energy and
security benefits and linguistic and ethnic ties.

Making everything worse, Turks, drawing on their 19thcentury great power
experiences, fear that powerful real or potential foes will exploit
these near abroad dangers. They point here not only to Russian support
to Armenia but Iranian collaboration with PKK elements in Iraq and
Syria. They also see US and other Western, notably French, military
arrangements with Athens as aimed at them, citing Washington's and
Paris's criticism of Turkey's actions while ignoring Greek sins (its
troops on Aegean islands demilitarized in various treaties, illegitimate
air space claims, and Law of the Sea provisions imposed on non-signatory
Turkey).

[These near **abroad security issues predate Erdogan and are hard-wired
into Turkish foreign policy** and popular sentiment, but because of the
often irritating way Ankara presents even reasonable arguments,
Washington and European capitals dismiss or belittle them]{.underline}.

This problem is compounded by Washington's difficulties, understanding
that if it wants states to support its global security agenda against
Russia or China, it has to take those states' immediate security
concerns seriously. This includes not just Turkey but, for example,
Saudi Arabia and the UAE with Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen.
Furthermore, Turkey's near abroad opponents, the PKK movement, Greece,
and Armenia, have strong diaspora lobbies in the US and Western Europe
who effectively portray Turkey as an eternal enemy regardless of
Ankara's policies, even those which at times accommodated Kurdish,
Greek, and Armenian interests.

[Compromise, horse trading, and just saying no, staples of most
diplomacy, are often seen on all sides as betrayals of NATO solidarity,
Western values, and past contributions and sacrifices.]{.underline}

Finally, achieving productive, transactional deals between Ankara and
the rest of the West, such as those cited above, is undercut by "band of
brothers" thinking in all the relevant capitals. Compromise, horse
trading, and just saying no, staples of most diplomacy, are often seen
on all sides as betrayals of NATO solidarity, Western values, and past
contributions and sacrifices. Most bilateral meetings with Ankara begin
with long-winded recitation of what the other is doing wrong, with a
naïve expectation that the other, if harangued enough, will stop doing
things truly important to it, such as Ankara's maintaining a complex
relationship with Russia or Washington's fighting ISIS with whatever
partner works.

A new course

The first step out of this dilemma is for all sides to recognize that
with Russian aggression, they face a unique international situation that
requires subordination of all other priorities to the core objective.
That sort of wisdom, familiar to Churchill, Roosevelt, Truman, military
planners, and in a perverse way, Putin, has largely faded in the West
since 1989, replaced by what has become conventional foreign policy
thinking: nothing is critical and innumerable factors compete for
consideration, for example moral, ideological, humanitarian, domestic,
security, alliance, economic, personal, or usually some triangulation of
them.

Both sides must prioritize vigorously containing Russia, seek
transactional deals on those issues between them that can be resolved,
and ignore the others.

In the impasse between Turkey and NATO, this conventional thinking
encourages states, buffeted by various interests and negative voices
towards Turkey, to treat it as a second class, suspect member of the
alliance, while benefiting from its extraordinary NATO contributions.
But conventional thinking also pushes Ankara, with its domestic
pressures, to see the Ukrainian crisis as simply another opportunity to
extort Europe over Turkey's second-class status, EU accession, arms
sales, and specific issues such as the PKK and the Aegean. Both sides
thus must prioritize vigorously containing Russia, seek transactional
deals on those issues between them that can be resolved, and ignore the
others. In short, accepting partners as they are, not as they should be.

The immediate challenge is NATO accession. Here Turkey has to blink
first and recognize that the stakes, not just stopping Russia but
preserving its own relations with NATO, require accepting half a loaf
(not always an Erdogan government trait). It cannot expect Sweden and
Finland to extradite people to a state whose legal system is under
continuous international criticism, nor for those countries to silence
freedom of expression, even when it is sympathetic to the terrorist PKK
cause. It should also be accepted that, while the fight against the PKK
is truly important to Turkish security, it is still secondary to Russia
advancing on its borders.

In return, Sweden should lift its ban on arms sales to Turkey (and the
US Congress the same with its informal ban, now impacting the F-16
sale). Finland and especially Sweden, given their long affinity for
"national liberation" movements, should cut official contacts with the
PKK and its fronts, recommit to Helsinki Final Act on noninterference in
others' internal affairs and give assurances they would cooperate in
NATO on issues important to Turkey.

Turkey's partners should continue counseling it against a new incursion
into northern Syria. But if Turkey compromises by only attacking PKK
elements west of the Euphrates, away from US forces and the main
anti-ISIS effort, Washington's objections should be muted. Likewise,
partners should urge Turkey to stop overflying Greek territory, but
simultaneously speak out on provocative Greek policies.

While these steps can manage the immediate crises Turkey has launched,
the longer-term solution, moving to a transactional relationship, needs
highest level US leadership. First, such a relationship requires dealing
with Erdogan; if Putin can do it with a geostrategic opponent, why
cannot American and European leaders with an ally, however difficult,
given the stakes. Second, the US needs someone at a very senior level to
complement the American ambassador as the administration's Turkish file
lead, not to communicate with the Turks but to corral the undisciplined
official and unofficial Washington policy worlds. That world can torpedo
any foreign policy effort, but doing so regarding Turkey is child's play
in the absence of presidential engagement and a Washington champion.

None of that will make a difference, however, unless Turkey's leadership
recognizes it must change some policies and, more so, attitudes toward
its NATO allies, whom at this point are all Turkey can count on faced
with an existential threat from Russia.

and NATO contributed to mitigating the Greek--Turkish crises through
socialization and

third-party mediation (Tsakonas, 2010). Mitchell and Hensel (2007: 724)
argue that

third-party intervention by regional organizations can reduce the
security dilemma by

providing conflictual dyads with assurances that long-term cooperation
will benefit their

national interests. Specifically, the incentives and disincentives of
the EU/EC discour-

aged Greece and Turkey from going to war. Neither side, nor their
leaderships, could

play the nationalist card to such an extent as to harm relations with
the EU/EC. Greece

was in a vulnerable position within the Union because of its endemic
economic crises,

while Turkey was anxious to make progress in its EU/EC membership
(Loizides, 2002;

Rumelili, 2003: 223). While Mitchell (2006: 26 f.) demonstrates that
joint regional

organization membership increases the probability of militarizing
disputes, this is only

partly true for Greece and Turkey, since the two countries reached the
brink of war in

multiple crises but never fought one in the past few decades, unlike
other conflictual

dyads.

One possible explanation for the low intensity of the Greek--Turkish
conflict is

Greece's refusal to endorse Turkey's EU accession unless the latter
ceased its occupation

of Cyprus and resolved the Aegean issue. Although, at times, Turkey
considered a com-

promise, it opted to escalate conflict, putting pressure on Greece and
the EU. However,

it never caused confrontation to such an extent as to irreversibly
terminate its EU ambi-

tions. Likewise, Greece's limited confrontational attitude has derived
from its precarious

position within the EU, aiming for negotiation gains but minimizing the
possibility of

major Turkish or EU reprisals. In other words, in the case of the
Greek--Turkish dyad, EU

accession dynamics led to low levels of conflict instead of conflict
resolution between

the two countries.

The Greek--Turkish crises provide insights for a discussion on
international institu-

tions between neo-realism and liberal institutionalism. Mearsheimer
(1994/1995, 1995)

argues that international institutions do not prevent states from going
to war. They do not

independently affect state behaviours and are the outcome of state
behaviours based on

self-interested calculations. Based on this assumption, Mearsheimer
argues that interna-

tional institutions do not cause peace. Taking the opposite point of
view, namely, liberal

institutionalism, Keohane and Martin (1995) and Wallander et al. (1999)
argue that inter-

national institutions affect the calculation of national interest and
promote reciprocal

cooperation between states, and are therefore an element of a lasting
peace.

In the case of the Greek--Turkish crises, liberal institutionalism seems
to reflect crisis

behaviour better than neo-realism. Although Mearsheimer (1995: 87)
argues that empiri-

cal evidence does not support the institutionalist argument that
institutions can cause

peace, the empirical evidence of this article demonstrates that regional
organizations can

prevent high levels of escalation even in the presence of acute security
dilemmas and

diversionary environments. More specifically, two regional
organizations, the EU and

NATO, contributed to mitigating -- although they admittedly did not
completely eradi-

cate -- Greek--Turkish crises. Thus, for our cases, Mearsheimer
underestimates the role of

international institutions in limiting escalations by overlooking the
mediating role and

values of regional organizations.

Nor does liberal institutionalism fully explain relations between
conflict and interna-

tional institutions, because, as Krebs (1999) and Rumelili (2003)
demonstrate in the

32 Cooperation and Conﬂict 46(1)

Greek--Turkish conflict, regional organizations sometimes have negative
influences on

conflict rather than promoting cooperation. In the more recent
literature, liberal institu-

tionalists appear to admit this point (e.g. see Wallander and Keohane
1999: 42 f.).

Nevertheless, it can be argued that liberal institutionalism explains
the role of regional

organizations in recent interstate crises more precisely than
neo-realism, because the

former expects that international institutions can cause peace through
security manage-

ment roles (Wallander and Keohane, 1999), whereas the latter does not.
In fact, both

Krebs (1999: 369) and Rumelili (2003: 217) admit that the negative
influences of the EU

and NATO do not mean that the Greek--Turkish conflict would have been
more easily

mitigated if these regional organizations had not been involved. The
validity of their

argument becomes evident if one considers the gradual improvement in
Greek--Turkish

relations in the past decade, especially following the 1999 earthquakes,
and if one com-

pares Greece--Turkey with parts of the globe lacking cross-country
regional institutions,

such as the Indian subcontinent

was in a vulnerable position within the Union because of its endemic
economic crises,

while Turkey was anxious to make progress in its EU/EC membership
(Loizides, 2002;

Rumelili, 2003: 223). While Mitchell (2006: 26 f.) demonstrates that
joint regional

organization membership increases the probability of militarizing
disputes, this is only

partly true for Greece and Turkey, since the two countries reached the
brink of war in

multiple crises but never fought one in the past few decades, unlike
other conflictual

dyads.

One possible explanation for the low intensity of the Greek--Turkish
conflict is

Greece's refusal to endorse Turkey's EU accession unless the latter
ceased its occupation

of Cyprus and resolved the Aegean issue. Although, at times, Turkey
considered a com-

promise, it opted to escalate conflict, putting pressure on Greece and
the EU. However,

it never caused confrontation to such an extent as to irreversibly
terminate its EU ambi-

tions. Likewise, Greece's limited confrontational attitude has derived
from its precarious

position within the EU, aiming for negotiation gains but minimizing the
possibility of

major Turkish or EU reprisals. In other words, in the case of the
Greek--Turkish dyad, EU

accession dynamics led to low levels of conflict instead of conflict
resolution between

the two countries.

The Greek--Turkish crises provide insights for a discussion on
international institu-

tions between neo-realism and liberal institutionalism. Mearsheimer
(1994/1995, 1995)

argues that international institutions do not prevent states from going
to war. They do not

independently affect state behaviours and are the outcome of state
behaviours based on

self-interested calculations. Based on this assumption, Mearsheimer
argues that interna-

tional institutions do not cause peace. Taking the opposite point of
view, namely, liberal

institutionalism, Keohane and Martin (1995) and Wallander et al. (1999)
argue that inter-

national institutions affect the calculation of national interest and
promote reciprocal

cooperation between states, and are therefore an element of a lasting
peace.

In the case of the Greek--Turkish crises, liberal institutionalism seems
to reflect crisis

behaviour better than neo-realism. Although Mearsheimer (1995: 87)
argues that empiri-

cal evidence does not support the institutionalist argument that
institutions can cause

peace, the empirical evidence of this article demonstrates that regional
organizations can

prevent high levels of escalation even in the presence of acute security
dilemmas and

diversionary environments. More specifically, two regional
organizations, the EU and

NATO, contributed to mitigating -- although they admittedly did not
completely eradi-

cate -- Greek--Turkish crises. Thus, for our cases, Mearsheimer
underestimates the role of

international institutions in limiting escalations by overlooking the
mediating role and

values of regional organizations.

Nor does liberal institutionalism fully explain relations between
conflict and interna-

tional institutions, because, as Krebs (1999) and Rumelili (2003)
demonstrate in the

32 Cooperation and Conﬂict 46(1)

Greek--Turkish conflict, regional organizations sometimes have negative
influences on

conflict rather than promoting cooperation. In the more recent
literature, liberal institu-

tionalists appear to admit this point (e.g. see Wallander and Keohane
1999: 42 f.).

Nevertheless, it can be argued that liberal institutionalism explains
the role of regional

organizations in recent interstate crises more precisely than
neo-realism, because the

former expects that international institutions can cause peace through
security manage-

ment roles (Wallander and Keohane, 1999), whereas the latter does not.
In fact, both

Krebs (1999: 369) and Rumelili (2003: 217) admit that the negative
influences of the EU

and NATO do not mean that the Greek--Turkish conflict would have been
more easily

mitigated if these regional organizations had not been involved. The
validity of their

argument becomes evident if one considers the gradual improvement in
Greek--Turkish

relations in the past decade, especially following the 1999 earthquakes,
and if one com-

pares Greece--Turkey with parts of the globe lacking cross-country
regional institutions,

such as the Indian subcontinent

**[No Impact -- Diversionary Peace]{.underline}**

**Diversionary peace, not war**

This article introduced the theory of diversionary peace, which improves
our understanding of the link between foreign policy making and
contentious civil-military relations. [[Contributing to peace abroad can
have coup proofing effects at home]{.mark} quite like the decision to go
to war. A thick description of [Tunisia served as an empirical]{.mark}
plausibility [probe]{.mark} of the mechanisms [linking peacekeeping to
coup-proofing]{.mark}. Participation in [peacekeeping establishes
feasibility obstacles for]{.mark} coup [coordination]{.mark}, the
[allocation of]{.mark} economic [resources to officers]{.mark}, the
[institutionalization of the]{.mark} military [apparatus]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} a [professionalized ethos in the officer
corps]{.mark}]{.underline}. In an emerging research programme on the
interplay of peacekeeping and domestic politics, studying Tunisia
reveals three novel findings. First, coup-proofing can be the unintended
outcome of dynamics in civil-military relations where political
incumbents did not design specific strategies to keep officers in the
barracks[. In Tunisia, it was the military leadership pushing for
peacekeeping participation more so than the Ben Ali regime. Second, the
[Tunisian case reveals]{.mark} that coup-proofing through [peacekeeping
is]{.mark} particularly [effective]{.mark}]{.underline} in countries
with small armies, where battalion strength mission participation
immediately introduces a high percentage of officers into a career
trajectory contributing to individual and collective
professionalization. It is in larger armies, with larger officer corps,
where military 96Author interview with Tunisian journalist, Tunis, 17
May 2017. 608 H. ALBRECHT leaderships and political incumbents remain
more selective on mission participants. Greater competition creates
winners and losers for the perks of peacekeeping and hence individual
grievances among those officers deprived of opportunities at
professional advancement. Third, and relatedly, Tunisia shows which
mechanisms prove particularly effective in advancing coup proofing.
While peacekeeping contributes to institutional professionalization and
the development of a professional ethos, these remain slow-moving facets
of a military's social fabric. Other dynamics and events, such as
international support for military training, the effect of economic
development on recruitment and procurement, and a military's deployment
in domestic or external conflicts certainly have an impact on military
professionalism as well, perhaps at a higher degree than the provision
or troops for international peacekeeping. Rather than such corporate
factors, it is the individual-level mechanisms highlighted in this
article -- feasibility obstacles and the provision of material resources
-- where peacekeeping generates the most significant impact on
coup-proofing. [[These findings have important]{.mark}
[empirical]{.mark} and theoretical [implications for scholars]{.mark} in
various thematic fields [across]{.mark} Comparative Politics and
[I]{.mark}nternational [R]{.mark}elations]{.underline}. Experts of
Middle East politics and civil-military relations will note the
empirical blind spot in the works on coup-proofing in Tunisia and
beyond. Peacekeeping participation has so far not been fully addressed
as an important element of the Tunisian military's engagement and helps
us better understand why, for instance, the military returned to the
barracks in 2011, that is, at a point in time where it could have
assumed power through the post-Arab Spring transition period. [[Scholars
interested]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the theory and empirical practice of
[diversionary war may consider a limitation to the theory's
applicability]{.mark}]{.underline} for weak armies. [While [war may not
always be an option]{.mark}, contributing to [peace]{.mark} can be
[equally attractive for]{.mark} its positive effects on
[civil]{.mark}-military [relations]{.mark}. In turn, the theory of
[diversionary peace]{.mark} offers a contribution to the research
programme on international peacekeeping in that it [proposes novel ideas
about the rationale for]{.mark} troop [commitments]{.mark} beyond
geostrategic considerations]{.underline}. Further research will be
necessary to explore the external validity of the findings from the
Tunisian case. [The broader [applicability of]{.mark} the [diversionary
peace]{.mark} appears to be [particularly promising]{.mark} for
civil-military relations during democratic transitions]{.underline},
such as in Latin America, and the post-conflict environments of small
states in sub-Sahara Africa. In fact, initial observations appear to
reveal the explanatory power of the diversionary peace in multiple cases
including Ghana, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, and
Senegal. While the diversionary peace should be seen as an important
component in the toolbox of foreign policy making, it remains a
medium-range theory with its explanatory power subject to important
context factors. [For one, the [theory works well
for]{.mark}]{.underline} small armies in [[authoritarian regimes]{.mark}
[that]{.mark}, [at]{.mark} the [time of]{.mark} increased [coup
threat]{.mark}, [would entertain opportunities for]{.mark} participation
in [peace]{.mark}keeping [missions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps more
importantly, participation in peacekeeping missions is not a
coup-proofing strategy equally available to authoritarian incumbents
across time and space. The very existence of a peacekeeping mission
along with the mission sponsor's invitation to participate come as
necessary conditions for incumbents to consider sending troops abroad.
These constraints ultimately limit the applicability of diversionary
peace to post-Cold War international politics for the dramatic increase
in peacekeeping missions after 1990. [Yet, since the number of
interstate wars has declined quite considerably during that same period,
[diversionary war becomes less likely and diversionary peace merits
greater attention]{.mark} in contemporary international
politics]{.underline}

In the same era, [[Turkey]{.mark} followed "a passive strategy of
renunciation" and [stayed]{.mark} in the [nonrevisionist]{.mark}
camp]{.underline}.59 Turkey increased its defense expenditures (see
Table 2) but its [[defenses were]{.mark} still [only effective for
limited regional warfare]{.mark}. Turkey could not face a major threat,
such as the Italian or German Air Force]{.underline}.60 Ankara remained
passive in the hope that the threat would disappear. [Turkey also used
international regimes]{.underline}, particularly when the revision of
the Lausanne Straits Convention started with Turkey's [application to
the League of Nations in April 1936.]{.underline} During the [process,
Turkey had pro-status quo tendencies carried out via multilateral
diplomacy and international law]{.underline}.61 It managed to win the
support of greater powers, i.e. Britain, to reshape other parties'
demands. Turkey invoked the rebus sic stantibus principle to terminate
the Straits Convention.62 With these maneuvers, Turkey, through the
Montreux Convention (1936), managed to offset Russia, and to achieve
control over the Bosporus and the Dardanelles as regulatory authority on
the transit of naval warships. Turkey then started shifting between
varying alliance structures against Italian expansionism in the Eastern
Mediterranean, which increased its value as a counterweight between
antagonistic alliances.63 Against Italian armaments in the Dodecanese
islands and Mussolini's Mare Nostrum rhetoric, [[Turkey successfully
cooperated with the British within the League]{.mark} to impose
sanctions on Italy after the invasion of Abyssinia and the signing of
the Balkan Entente of 1934.]{.underline} Once the Abyssinia Crisis
cooled down, Italy tried to reharmonize relations with Turkey by
revoking its claims over Turkish lands.64 [In its relations with the

member]{.mark}]{.underline}, which it considered to be of Western
design.67 Turkey also rejected Stalin's quest for security against
Hitler via the joint Turkish-Soviet defense system on the Straits.68
Turkey managed to accomplish these relations while maintaining the
framework of neutrality. In the 1930s, [Ank[ara made a special effort to
not be on either side of the polarizing international system, but did
not completely detach itself either]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Turkey did not conclude agreements with any one side, which could
potentially have restricted its revenues from the other. Two clear
examples were Ankara's rejection of Stalin's offer for a joint defense
system of the Turkish straits against Germany and its non-conclusion of
an agreement with the Germans for chrome, which could cut down on sales
to the Allies.

During the Cold War and until 2001, Greece hosted US nuclear weapons on
its territory, as part of a NATO nuclear-sharing agreement. Yet, recent
geopolitical developments - the US's progressive military disengagement
from the Middle East, its \"pivot to Asia\", debate around removing
nuclear weapons from Turkey - highlight Greece's potential to become a
nuclear base again. Greece is sold to the idea of greater European
strategic autonomy and is not suspicious of France, unlike other member
states. However, Athen's lack of reaction following French President
Emmanuel Macron's February 2020 speech is due to the country's other
internal priorities and its commitment to NATO as the only actor capable
of offering nuclear deterrence at the moment. In this fifth episode of
our series Weapons of Mass Debate, Yvonni Efstathiou, Programme
Coordinator and Research Analyst for Defense and Military Analysis at
IISS, and Bill Kappis, Lecturer at the Centre for Security and
Intelligence Studies in the University of Buckingham, analyze Greece's
position on the future of European security.

[There is hardly any evidence of a debate concerning nuclear weapons
within the Greek military and political apparatus, mainly due to
concerns regarding the sensitivity of the issue in international
affairs, but also due to the political cost associated with the topic.
Despite the fact that from 1978 to 2001, the Hellenic Airforce Araxos
Air Base hosted the NATO 345 Air Munitions Company under the NATO
nuclear sharing arrangements, **the Greeks are sceptical about nuclear
deployments**]{.underline}, with most critics, unsurprisingly, hailing
from the left of the political spectrum. 

In any case, the fact remains that Greece has been one of just seven
nations to have hosted US nuclear bombs on their territory, as part of
NATO nuclear-sharing agreements. [Yet, the **country's decision not to
retain its nuclear strike capability** by scrapping its A-7E warplanes,
meant that Athens **curtailed its capacity to participate in the US
nuclear deployment programme**. This reportedly resulted in the
withdrawal of 20 US thermonuclear gravity bombs (B61) in 2001, following
years of discussions around the subject. Nevertheless, **Greece
continues to support the Alliance's nuclear deterrence doctrine**, as
indicated by the country's endorsement of relevant Alliance
statements.]{.underline}

Recent geopolitical developments suggest there should be a renewed
interest in bolstering conventional and nuclear deterrence within NATO
and, more specifically, within the European operational theatre. The
reduction of US troop numbers in the continent has continued unabated
since the first steps of American disengagement from Europe and the
Middle East, during the Obama administration. The so-called US \"pivot
to Asia,\" meanwhile, suggests that future American deployments will be
aimed at bolstering power projection in the Asia-Pacific, bearing an
adverse impact on the only superpower's capacity to face concurrent
security crises across the globe. This major geopolitical shift will
undoubtedly \"test\" the credibility of American deterrence in Europe.
Extended deterrence (preventing an armed attack against another allied
state or group of states) is, in theory, much more demanding to maintain
in a credible manner, as the deterrer should, in principle, be perceived
as both capable and willing to deliver an appropriate response to the
perceived challenger. Providing a robust extended deterrence umbrella to
both European and Asia-Pacific allies is conceivable for the US, but far
from straightforward, even for the sole superpower.

The need for a renewed debate becomes all the more important as the
demise of the INF treaty could further weaken Europe's nuclear
deterrence, as the INF was heavily geared towards intra-European
strategic stability. The advent, moreover, of hypersonic missiles and
their potential introduction into the European nuclear strategic
landscape opens the door to additional pressures on the perceived
credibility of the continent's nuclear deterrence. Finally, the Russian
and Iranian nuclear programmes, as well as the nuclear aspirations of
other regional powers in Europe's vicinity, (i.e. Turkey) should
mobilize Europe and thereby Greece to revisit and reflect upon this
policy domain. Taking into consideration Greece's desire for a
strategically autonomous Europe, Athens should be, at least in theory,
in favour of a renewed debate around nuclear weapons both as part of
NATO burden-sharing arrangements and as a proponent of French deterrent
capabilities within the EU.

[The most recent war of words may have domestic political
purposes]{.underline}

One hundred summers ago, the forces of the Turkish National Movement,
led by the charismatic and confident Mustafa Kemal, had turned the tide
and begun pushing the invading Greeks further and further west, with
nowhere to go but into the sea.

Just a year prior, Greek military leaders had felt so confident
advancing into the Anatolian heartland that they reportedly invited
their British allies to a victory dinner in Kemal's new Turkish capital,
Ankara. But the Turks halted that advance at the brutal, game-changing
Battle of Sarkaya, some 50 kilometres west of Ankara, and reversed the
momentum.

In March 1922, the Allies, led by France, the UK, Italy and the US,
suggested the two sides meet for an armistice. But, not unlike Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelensky in recent weeks, ignoring western advice to
hand land to Russia, Kemal instead hoped to push the invaders fully out
of his territory.

To that end, Turkish forces launched what came to be known as the Great
Offensive in late August and quickly took Afyonkarahisar and Dumlupinar.
On September 1, Kemal famously urged his charges: "Your first goal is
the Mediterranean. Forward!"

They reached their destination in a matter of days, a humbling defeat
for the Greeks and a canonical victory for Kemal, who would sign the
Treaty of Lausanne the next year, found the Republic of Turkey and later
be dubbed "Ataturk", or Father of the Turks.

[This region-shaping moment came to mind last week when Turkish
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, amid fast-rising Greco-Turkish tensions,
delivered a rare tweet stream in Greek, advising Athens to mind its
manners in the Aegean. "We warn once again Greece to be prudent, to stay
away from dreams, rhetoric and actions that will lead to results it will
regret, as happened a century ago," he tweeted]{.underline}.

Three decades of relative amity followed the war and the 1923 population
exchange, but the two neighbours and rivals [have been at each other's
throats](https://www.thenationalnews.com/opinion/comment/2021/09/20/why-turkey-and-greece-are-at-it-again/) ever
since: Turkish pogroms in 1955, Turkey's [invasion of
Cyprus](https://www.thenationalnews.com/opinion/comment/is-a-two-state-cyprus-a-real-possibility-1.1206048) in
1974 and the island's ensuing division; banging the drums of war in
1987, 1996 and 2020.

Over the past year, a series of talks hinted at a thaw, until Greek
Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis visited Washington in late May,
finalised a deal for F-35 fighter jets and urged the US Congress not to
send military hardware, presumably F-16s, to Turkey. "He no longer
exists for me," Mr Erdogan said of Mr Mitsotakis in response. "I will
never agree to meet with him."

Greece came back with a dismissive comment and, as per the routine, the
tensions soon escalated to include maritime border disagreements in the
Mediterranean, Aegean island militarisation and violations of airspace.

Last week, [after Ankara hinted that the sovereignty of certain Greek
islands in the Aegean might come under question, Athens [sent letters to
the
UN](https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/europe/2022/05/27/turkey-told-to-stop-questioning-greeces-sovereignty-in-letter-to-un/) outlining
its complaints and the US urged the Nato allies to resolve their
disputes through diplomacy]{.underline}. High drama, yet also a bit of a
broken record.

Amid the greatest hits, the longtime Turkish leader's reference to what
happened a century ago stands out. Setting aside the obvious point --
Greece's humbling -- that Turkish victory still today represents a
defeat of western imperialism.

Greek forces had captured a great swathe of Anatolia stretching from
Izmir to Bursa and Eskisehir, while the Allies had taken control of the
Mediterranean jewel of Antalya and the grand prize, Istanbul, as well as
Canakkale -- ensuring full control of the Turkish straits. Not since
Fatih Sultan Mehmet II trotted into Constantinople on his white horse in
May 1453 had Turks felt so vulnerable.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during their meeting in Istanbul in
March. AP Photo

Mr Erdogan's reference signalled that Turks today might feel similarly
hemmed in by its supposed western allies: when Greece places troops on
Aegean islands (though there's little evidence of this); when the EU
restricts Turkey's maritime boundaries or access to Cypriot energy
reserves; when the US partners with Turkey's foes in northern Syria and
opposes Ankara's Syria policy.

The ruling AKP has in recent weeks received its lowest-ever polling
numbers, just a year out from a national vote, and Turkish warnings of
aggression against Greece are an assertion of nationalist might that is
largely meant for a domestic audience.

Of course, it's not all for show. Ryan Gingeras, a top Turkish historian
and national security professor at the California-based Naval
Postgraduate School, wrote last week that, in light of Russia's invasion
of Ukraine, a new Greco-Turkish war "​​is not only possible but perhaps,
at some point, probable\".

**[Yet at least for now, these standoffs almost appear staged. As each
side, and each country's opposition, takes political advantage of the
moment, one can almost envision back-channel diplomats sending each
other quiet thumbs up about the ramped-up rhetoric.]{.underline}**

As with Ankara's looming [incursion into northern
Syria](https://www.thenationalnews.com/opinion/comment/2022/05/31/can-turkey-still-make-military-gains-without-alienating-its-new-friends/) to
take on Kurdish militants, a bit of rhetorical sparring with Greece
underscores Turkey's military's confidence while also sticking it to the
"imperialist" West. Domestically, that's a win-win.

[Going to war with Greece, on the other hand, would be disastrous for
Turkey, Greece, the US and Nato -- not to mention the Nato-backed war
effort in Ukraine]{.underline}. But as recent history has shown, that it
is an exercise in futility doesn't mean it won't happen.
