# BBE Updates -- Aff/Neg

Thanks to the BBE students for their work on this file. It contains an
assortment of affirmative and negative cards to update the Democracy QPQ
CP, Midterms DA, NATO Bad, Turkey PIC and Cognitive Biotech Neg files.

[Cyborgization is only **one possible path** towards superintelligent
enhanced humans]{.underline}. [It could in principle also be reached
e.g. by means **of genetic engineering/breeding and
biotechnology.**]{.underline} Yampolskiy and Spellchecker (2016)
conclude that "[augmented humans with IQ beyond 250 would be
superintelligent with respect to our current position on the
intelligence curve but would be **just as dangerous to us, unaugmented
humans, as any sort of artificial superintelligence.**]{.underline}" We
come to the same conclusion with regard to Malevolent Cyborgization,
[because it could serve similar stakeholders to **accomplish the same
unethical goals representing existential risks for humanity as in the
MAI case**]{.underline}

### International Collaboration Good

[In the future, cyborg-systems could become a **daily reality** offering
a variety of promising perspectives regarding human enhancement, but
their development and deployment will then **need to be regulated**.
Besides a legal obligation for open source cyborg-sytems, a possible
approach for a society willing to prevent MC and related risks could for
instance be measures **inducing an obligation** for all stakeholders
developing cyborg-systems to adhere to "**Cyborg Safety"
guidelines**,]{.underline} which could be defined by an ethical board
for superintelligence[. Nowadays, there is yet **no explicit binding
international interdisciplinary ethical board** for
superintelligence]{.underline} containing e.g. AI, AI Safety,
Cybersecurity, Neuroscience, Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Law experts
(just to name a few) at the same time. [Such a collaboration would
though be of great value to maintain an overview of all critical
developments with the aim to reach superintelligence]{.underline}.
However, [forward-thinking interdisciplinary frameworks similar to the
Asilomar AI Principles (FLI 2017) **could serve as a basis and should be
extended**, since there are always security holes that remain undetected
and characteristicall]{.underline}y, only one specially selected
successful MAI or MC attack trial could be
