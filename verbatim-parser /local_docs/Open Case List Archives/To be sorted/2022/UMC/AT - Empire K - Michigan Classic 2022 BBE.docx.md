Given the small population of American atheists as a percentage of the
total population, the question that now concerns us is this: [where are
all these [atheists]{.mark} who must [constitute the suffering
multitude]{.mark}?]{.underline} Assuming the highest estimate for the
atheist population of each country, the top 10 atheist countries are
Sweden, Vietnam, Denmark, Norway, Japan, the Czech Republic, Finland,
France, South Korea and Germany. The atheist population in these nations
ranges from a low of 49 per cent in Germany up to a high of 85 per cent
in Sweden.14 At this point it is important to note that the majority of
these nations, indeed many of the nations with significant atheist
communities, reside within the European Union. [[If Hardt and Negri are
correct]{.mark}, then these '[atheist nations' should have]{.mark}
deplorable economic suffering among their populations and [worse]{.mark}
income [inequality]{.mark} [than]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates. Yet this is not the case.]{.underline} In fact, only
Vietnam comes close to the USA in terms of income inequality as measured
by the Gini coefficient. All the others have a Gini coefficient below
0.34 and only Japan dips below 0.25, meaning that the income
distributions of these nations are in the optimal ranges for growth and
prosperity. It would seem that prosperity, not an increase in
exploitation and suffering, leads to a decline of religion Let us now
consider several nations with Gini coefficients that are more unequal
than the United States; perhaps there we can find a preponderance of
atheists to support Empire's dismissal of religion. Mexico,Brazil and
Argentina (indeed most of South America), South Africa, Namibia and
Botswana all have Gini coefficients in excess of 0.50, yet only
Argentina appears among the top 50 nations in terms of atheist
populations (in the 45th position, a scant two spots behind the USA)
with 8 per cent of the total population as atheists. The rest of these
nations have less than 7 per cent of their total population as
self-described atheists.15 Greater inequality and suffering on the part
of the multitude 797 McDaniel: [[Multitude against Empire do not seem to
result in a lack of faith]{.mark} within the multitude as Hardt and
Negri imply.]{.underline} On the contrary, those [[countries that
are]{.mark} [experiencing greater inequality have higher proportions of
religious persons]{.mark} than those with greater equality and
prosperity. While individual religions act to unite portions of the
multitude together under the banners of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism,
etc., at the same time, however, religion acts as a divisive force,
separating Christians from Jews, Muslims from Christians, Hindus from
Buddhists and so forth.]{.underline} Religions identify themselves so as
to create a sense of unity, but this same labeling also creates a
division among the multitude. By labeling themselves 'Christian', a
third of the world's population has at the same time labeled two-thirds
of the world's population as 'Other' (to use Hardt's and Negri's
terminology); that is to say, other than us, i.e. non-Christian. So
while it has the attractive power of unity and immobility to draw people
to it in a time of crisis, change and uncertainty, [[religion]{.mark}
also [divides]{.mark} up the [multitude along]{.mark} these [lines of
faith]{.mark}. This [division]{.mark} not only [makes seeking a unified
community]{.mark} outside their religious affiliations
[difficult]{.mark} for most practitioners, the continuing notion of
different faiths as inherently 'other' makes the seeking of such a unity
undesirable for many religious persons.]{.underline} Herein lies the
problem for Hardt and Negri: [[religion must be destroyed in order for
the multitude to exist]{.mark} as a unified force capable of overcoming
Empire; so long as the multitude remains divided along religious
boundaries, [the multitude will not be fully mobile, unified or]{.mark},
most importantly, [capable]{.mark} of making the social demands
necessary to overcome Empire.]{.underline} Bringing our current argument
together at this point, we see that Hardt and Negri's notion of the
multitude as a unified force capable of standing in opposition to Empire
requires an end to the various religious belief structures that separate
and divide the multitude. At the same time, the economic forces that
exist within Empire of exploitation and suffering among the multitude
indicate an increase of religious belief and acceptance among the
multitude. Simplifying the argument, to create multitude economically
means to create more religious belief, but to create more religious
belief means to deny the creation of a unified multitude. Within their
discourse on the creation of Empire, Hardt and Negri 'object to social
contract theorists who pretend "that the subject can be understood
pre-socially and outside the community"' and yet they also claim that
'no subjectivity is outside'.20 [Religious beliefs, while perhaps not a
major aspect of the European community at present, are very much a part
of the global community. By omitting from their discourse the influence
of religion on the multitude, Hardt and Negri have placed on 799
McDaniel: Multitude against Empire the 'outside' an important
subjectivity of the multitude. It is this contradiction of their own
construction in Empire that results in their contradictory notion of the
creation of the multitude as a unified force capable of opposing the
capitalist Empire.]{.underline}

#### Alt fails\-\--the multitude doesn't know what it's fighting.

science at the University of Calgary. "Empire and Imperialism: A
Critical Reading of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri." Canadian Journal
of political science. March 2007. https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/ //NM

Michael Walzer, reflecting in a 2002 Dissent article \~vol. 49, Spring!
upon the compelling issues in world politics, asked "[[Can there be a
decent Left]{.mark}?" After reading Atilio A. Boron's impassioned and
derisive critique of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's
Empire]{.underline} \~Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 2000!,
[one wonders whether today there can be an empirically sophisticated,
coherent Left]{.underline}. \~Negri, by the way, spent seventeen years
in Italian prisons for his involvement with the Red Brigade and the
murder of Italian politician Aldo Moro.! [Boron, a professor of
political theory at the University of Buenos Aires claims, no doubt
rightly, that the last three decades, embracing the end of the Cold War,
[the impact of neo-liberal policies on the "periphery" and sweeping
technological changes, have necessitated a reformulation of leftist
thinking]{.mark}. The influential Empire, which advances a
root-and-branch restructuring of socialist thought, though hugely
popular among anti-globalization groups and already translated into over
a dozen languages, is to Boron emphatically not it.]{.underline} While
paying obeisance to Hardt and Negri's "noble intentions and intellectual
and political honesty" \~4--5!, the author proceeds to shred virtually
all their main contentions. At least the general reader surmises as
much, for Boron fails to provide an account of Empire adequate for those
who are learning about Empire for the first time to judge. At the same
time, summarizing the over 500-page and all-butunintelligible Empire is
no mean task inasmuch as the book consists of an impenetrable mix of
postmodern theory and systems analysis. What does seem clear, however,
is that Empire---the forces of globalization, including the unobstructed
flow of information, capital and labour---provides a complete contrast
to imperialism because it has no centre and is not under anyone or
anything's control. Absent, too, are hierarchy and sovereign
nation-states for it is [[Empire that is now sovereign. Opposing Empire
is the "multitude," which seems to include humanity]{.mark}, notably
those who resist, from subsistence farmers to knowledge workers and
jihadists, who are characterized [simply as "being against." Precisely
against what, however, is unsatisfactorily
explained.]{.mark}]{.underline} Dissidence in Empire is metaphorically
depicted by the authors as a snake, undulating about Empire looking for
opportunities to attack. It is small wonder to Boron that the authors
are wrong-headed since their analyses are grounded in "French postmodern
philosophy, Italian politics and US economic science" \~8! rather than
the socialist canon of Rosa Luxemburg and Vladimir Lenin. Boron
considers the most egregious of Hardt and Negri's mistakes to include
the asserted end of imperialism, the disintegration of the state and the
notion of independent multinational corporations. [[Premised on a
Chomskyesque critique of US fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy, Boron
insists that an [American empire, together with the multinational
corporations incorporated]{.mark} under its laws whose interests are
American interests, continues to [dominate the world]{.mark} and despoil
vulnerable countries looting their natural resources, thereby refuting
Hardt and Negri's notion of the insignificance of states.]{.underline}
Although Boron maintains that "the atrocious 9011 attacks," which were
"momentous and spectacular" \~6!, undermine Hardt and Negri's thrust, he
does not return to terrorism, but persists in the assumption that social
injustice continues to be the world's most pressing problem. No doubt
Boron comes by his fury honestly. Latin America's economic and political
distress is as intractable as in any other part of the "periphery."
There is widespread economic suffering, civil insecurity and social
disintegration. How many of these misfortunes can be laid at the door of
neoliberal restructuring is, however, 280 Recensions / Reviews surely
debatable. Some neoliberal reforms have misfired, causing hardship and
dislocation, but more have been constructive. Much of Latin America's
misery can be laid at other doors, especially the weakness of democracy
and other political institutions. Boron concedes that he not only wants
to provide a theoretical context within which the world economic and
political problematique can be analyzed, he also wants to facilitate
political change. This admission does not inspire confidence in the
unconverted; nor does the author's reliance on pragmatic arguments. For
example, Boron attacks Hardt and Negri's conception of a
deterritorialized space on the ground that "the classic distinction
between centre and periphery\...vanishes into thin air" \~11!. [What is
at issue here, however, is not how much of Boron's preferred conceptual
apparatus Hardt and Negri displace but [what approach emerging realities
will support, a matter that must be settled empirically]{.mark}. Flawed
arguments along with the overwhelmingly polemical tone of this volume
will be troublesome for those for whom understanding the world is more
than enough]{.underline}. Unless readers already agree with Boron's
political orientation, they will remain unconvinced by his analysis. If
the Left is to be revitalized, it will not, unfortunately, be at the
hands of Boron, Negri or Hardt.

Baffled by the 'logic' of one of Empire's central arguments, [Wolfe
observes: 'Thus [one has to read Hardt and Negri's question many times
over, so flat out wrong are its assertions and assumptions]{.mark}, in
order to judge whether they can possibly be serious' (2001: 2). The task
the authors set themselves was serious. But the big picture outlined in
[Empire]{.mark}, eclectically combining elements of Marxism,
managerialism and postmodernism, [remains unconvincing and often
incomprehensible]{.mark}]{.underline}. The book is neither a robust
guide to the realities and challenges of global governance, nor to the

With respect to the latter, Wright argues that the recurrent problem of
Negri and operaismo has been a penchant for all-embracing categories,
and ['the [unrelenting preoccupation with the technical composition of
labour power]{.mark} as a key explanation in the explanation of
behaviour' (2002: 226). This reached its peak with the socialised worker
concept, which flattened differences instead of opening out
contradictory dynamics and tendencies]{.underline}. There is much truth
in this observation, but the problem runs deeper. [[Hardt and Negri
largely ignore the real insights that can be generated from Marxist
political economy]{.mark},]{.underline} but reproduce what is, arguably,
its weakest point---the gravedigger thesis. [[This search for an
economic actor inside the hidden abode of production, who is then
required to be a transcendent political subject with the responsibility
of changing the whole society, creates an impossible practical and
theoretical burden]{.mark}. Even within these terms, [the
multitude]{.mark}---'all the subjugated and exploited'---[is not a
meaningful political subject]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Instead of the
difficult task of actually mobilising labour, we are presented with a
picture of a multitude already formed and victorious]{.underline}. [When
faced with the reality that potential revolutionaries in various
struggles did not recognise either themselves or others as part of an
expanding chain of revolt, [Hardt and Negri can only take refuge in the
banal argument that this was a failure of communication (]{.mark}p.
54-5).]{.underline} Which leaves us, finally, with their own conclusion.
[For all the talk of postmodern republicanism, the underlying logic of
Empire is an infantile vanguardism]{.underline}. The labour, whether
immaterial or multitudinous, in whose name the book speaks is labour to
which the communist militant, lauded in the postscript, imputes motives,
labels struggles, allocates roles, and proclaims unity of purpose and
outcome. [[Intellectual militants become the means of
communication]{.mark}, except that what they are communicating is a
fantasy that exists only in their own heads. This is absolutely
consistent with the history of Negri and Italian workerism]{.underline}.
For all its earlier insights, from its inception this current was
distinctive for its view that what labour actually thought was secondary
to its position as a particular category of labour (the mass worker, the
social worker, immaterial labour, and so on). As Negri remarked of the
social worker, 'At the political and social level, this subject presents
a complete materialization of consciousness within the structure of its
own existence.

If one wants to do justice to this claim, one would have to push the
organization of the boundary between paid and unpaid labor into the
center of a critique of political economy\*/and this in order to
comprehend the very shifts in this boundary. The thesis of a dissolving
boundary between production and reproduction treats this boundary as an
historical relic, an object of anachronistic research agendas, and thus
no longer a valid subject of study. In Hardt and Negri, the division
between productive and reproductive work only appears in the form of the
distinction 9 Hardt and Negri, op. cit., p. 364. 10 Frigga Haug, ''Zur
Theorie der Geschlechterverha¨ltnisse,'' Argument, 243, 2001, pp.

Downloaded by \[Erciyes University\] at 05:18 22 December 2014 between
direct and indirect forms of capitalist exploitation.12 [[This may be
read as a vague reference to longstanding debates about the role of
household work in the generation of surplus value]{.mark}, debates which
Hardt and Negri do not engage with explicitly. Certainly, the [thesis on
the dissolution of boundaries makes it impossible to critique the
hierarchies that are produced in the process of dividing paid from
unpaid work.]{.mark} This does not mean, however, that the division
between productive and reproductive labor is not shifting]{.underline}.
This becomes particularly clear when one considers hegemonic models of
'''female'' wage labor, notably the attractive model of the
''successful'' professional woman in the fields of culture, finance or
advertising. Empire correctly thematizes how qualifications acquired
during so-called free time through cultural or political groups or
through private relationships become valorized in the labor process.
[[The division between work and leisure has become more mutable as a
result of flexible working time]{.mark}. Certainly, the housewife
model\*/ [the hegemonic model of femininity]{.mark} under Fordism\*/[no
longer applies]{.mark} (and was never a reality for many women, in any
case). In light of these displacements, one should not lose sight of the
fact that these boundaries shift in significantly uneven ways. Women's
workforce participation faces extremely stable gender divisions of labor
in the so-called sphere of reproductive work, notably in child and
elderly care.]{.underline} One only has to recall that that a mere 1.5
percent of people who take official parental leave in Germany are men.
In this sense, the convergence model of production and reproduction
reflects less the reality of labor relations than an increasingly
hegemonic image of female subjectivity, where reproductive labor
disappears into the holes and gaps of the patchwork that is the
neoliberal working day. The delegation of reproductive labor to
underprivileged women, particularly migrant women, is certainly to be
understood as a displacement of the boundaries between productive and
reproductive labor as well. This case expresses everything but the
dissolution of (unpaid) reproductive labor, however. One factor accounts
for the extreme social and financial devaluation of this work. [[It is
not seen as skilled and qualified labor, but rather as something that
women and girls are ''naturally'' socialized to do.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Also, reproductive labor remains structurally close to unpaid labor,
with its extreme flexibility of hours and tasks as well as the
mechanisms of emotional dependence and familial loyalty. This domestic
worker model, which depends on high wage differentials, cannot be
universalized. It is logically untenable for a domestic worker to pay
yet another domestic to look after her own reproductive work. Finally,
the thesis of a shrinking divide between production and reproduction
appears absurd when one thinks of the neoliberal cutbacks to public
services such as kindergartens and health care, which (re)privatize
reproductive labor and force unpaid women to pick up the slack in the
system. 12Ibid., p. 53. DISSOLVED BOUNDARIES AND ''AFFECTIVE LABOR'' 81

unpaid reproductive labor should be organized is no longer a question

Rather than speaking about a dissolution of the boundaries between
production and reproduction, it would make more sense to analyze the
restructuring of reproductive labor along the categories ''race, class,
gender'' on an international level. This would be the only way to
realize a materialist approach to the ''production of life,'' something
Hardt and Negri promise but do not carry out. [Because Empire offers no
basis for a critique of the political economy of gender regimes, its
claim to subvert dominant models of subjectivity must

#### Alt fails and TURNS impacts\-\-- The neg interpretation of Empire leads to more existential risks like war and economic collapse

Our [charge against [Hardt and Negri]{.mark} and other similar
left-liberal theorists, then, is twofold. First, they [misinterpret
Marx's labour theory of value]{.mark} by regarding immaterial labour as
historically and constitutively distinct from the relations of capital
that Marx analysed. Second, and consequently, [they fetishize protests
whether antagonistic of capital or not]{.mark}, ideologically Marxist or
not, strategically effective or not]{.underline}. Whereas Deleuze and
Guattari distinguish between movements of flight and movements of
interest, Hardt and Negri do [not. [Their use of both Marx and Deleuze
and Guattari is selective at best]{.underline}]{.mark}[. This has
important consequences for understanding the nature of capital and
formulating strategies for resisting capital]{.underline}. Indeed, it is
with some irony that Capital and AntiOedipus are prescient of the
current financial crisis of capitalism. [[A reading of Capital through
Anti-Oedipus should have provided Hardt and Negri with the means to
develop a historically important critique of finance capital]{.mark} and
to develop ideas on resistance that are currently absent in left
thinking. Instead, we get a theoretically inventive but ultimately
left-liberal tome masquerading as political radicalism]{.underline}. In
his recent book on violence Žižek makes the point that 'the threat today
is not passivity, but pseudo-activity, the urge to be "active", to
"participate", to mask the nothingness of what goes on' (Žižek, 2008:
183). [Quoting from the same source, [it is better]{.mark}, as Badiou
argues, '[to do nothing than to contribute to the invention of formal
ways of rendering visible that which Empire already recognizes as
existent]{.mark}.' This is what Hardt and Negri's work has amounted
to.]{.underline} A misrecognition of power is present to the extent that
they can celebrate the 'carnivalesque' king-for-a-day spectacles of
protest while the capitalist class relentlessly attack forms of
proletarian solidarity. [The consequences are clear: [when there]{.mark}
[is no depth to power,]{.mark} as in Hardt and Negri's analysis, [then
we can all be made to feel equally guilty]{.mark} for poverty,
oppression and environmental devastation. [We each become responsible
for global warming]{.mark} (consuming in a sustainable way), [the war on
Iraq]{.mark} (joining in global protest), [and capitalist crisis]{.mark}
(calling for better regulation of the market to stifle our desire for
easy credit and quick returns on share investments). [Politics becomes a
vocal and spectacular demonstration of our opposition to poverty and
violence, an aggregate of interpassivity.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Downloaded from crs.sagepub.com at Glasgow University Library on October
12, 2014 Cremin and Roberts 195 Hardt and Negri have failed to recognize
in their analysis the essential logic that drives capital to seek new
ways to appropriate surplus value and therefore their ideas on social
change appear unconvincing. Their ideas in this respect share a
consistency with those claiming there is no alternative to the market
given that there is no empirical singularity of exception to capital in
their analysis, nor therefore the potentiality for contingent movements
to find expression through a common or universalized cause. This has the
effect of displacing critique of the market, regardless of their
intentions, by focusing on the individualizing symptoms of economic
liberalization through its ideological mediations. In other words, Hardt
and Negri are guilty of amplifying a language of immateriality that
merely reproduces what in less critical ways free-market ideologues
would like to imagine: that there has occurred a decisive break with the
political economy that Marx so lucidly deconstructs thereby rendering
his analysis obsolete. Thus unintentionally but rather carelessly their
arguments fall into the territory the left-liberal occupies. We
therefore argue for a return to the Deleuze and Guattari of
Anti-Oedipus, the basis for their subsequent writings such as A Thousand
Plateaus. They were able to identify in the capitalist axiomatic its
tendency towards financialization and the possibility for lines of
flight from commodifying capture through temporally assembled desiring
machines of generalized subtraction. Badiou's subtractive (evental)
politics is methodologically distinct from Deleuze and Guattari's, but
his ideas sketched out in this article are a useful reminder that
difference is a politically denuded category however empirically
different we are. For Badiou politics is the subtraction, in Lacanian
terms, of the obscene supplement or substance that an order both depends
on and disavows. It is a politics articulated through a subjective
fidelity to the event, say a revolution, or truth procedure that is at
once singular and universal. Given the magnitude of the current crisis
of free-market capitalism, it is all the more important that a line is
drawn between Marxism, inclusive of post-structuralist insights into
subjectivity and desire, and those left-liberal theorists of
informational post-industrial capitalism. [[Hardt and Negri's analysis
was false before the crisis]{.mark}. If their ideas continue to hold
sway among theorists of the left, it will prove an obstacle to
understanding the nature of crises but also undermine attempts to
develop an ideologically and strategically coherent response at a time
when such a response is most needed.]{.underline} Our starting point is
to return to, repeat, and affirm our commitment to what Žižek (Butler et
al., 2000) describes as 'politics proper' as the possibility of global
emancipation that contrasts with the impossibility of substantive
transformation under Hardt and Negri's logic. [[Anxiety about the world
in which we live from the knowledge made available to us through new
means of communication will simply reinforce our interpassivity unless
we are prepared to confront the real conditions underlying
interpassivity]{.mark}. Only then can we begin to transform our
post-political gestures into properly political actions.]{.underline}

The arrogance of the "international community" and its rights of
intervention across the globe are not a series of arbitrary events or
disconnected episodes. They compose a system, which needs to be fought
with a coherence not less than its own.33 [[Desertion is not a
particularly socialist]{.mark} (or even political) value, [yet it
occupies a central place in Hardt and Negri's conception of change in
Empire]{.mark}. To desert, as the Oxford English Dictionary states, is
"to abandon, forsake, relinquish, give up (a thing); to depart from (a
place or position)," It signifies failure and a violation of an oath or
allegiance. Desertion is wilful abandonment of duty or
obligation]{.underline}. There is also a condition of being deserted,
desertedness, which, interestingly, in a theological register, signifies
spiritual despondency: "A sense of the dereliction of God (Johnson)."
Empire is premised on the power of desertion and nomadism. Having in one
breath criticized postcolonial theory for being outmoded, Hardt and
Negri go on to privilege its most recent theoretical trope in the next:
the migrant as bearer of truth, as symbol of a new world and its
liberatory potential. Through migrancy, the multitude anticipates and
invents Empire: "The deterritorializing power of the multitude is the
productive force that sustains Empire and at the same time the force
that calls for and makes necessary its destruction" (61). [[At the same
time as being controlled by Empire, the multitude determines its
development]{.mark}: "[it is always the initiatives of organized labor
power that determine the figure of capitalist development]{.mark}"
(208). [Which turns Marx on his head]{.mark}. In Capital, proletarian
migrancy or nomad labor is a symptom of the power of capital: "They are
the light infantry of capital, thrown by it, according to its needs, now
to this point, now to that. When they are not on the march, they
'camp.'"34 [Undermining Marx's emphasis on the rule of capital over
labor, the struggle between capital and labor comes then to be defined
through desertion, exodus, and refusal]{.mark}. Hardt and Negri
substitute political passivity for challenge and opposition to capital.
Class struggle becomes about disengagement]{.underline}. The politics of
refusal becomes, in anarchist mode, a refusal of politics. It is quite
ironic, therefore, that after presenting Empire as a realm "beyond
politics," Hardt and Negri end up advocating a reformist sort of
politics---like the right to global citizenship, a social wage, and the
right of reappropriation. But then such a contradiction between
revolutionary rhetoric and reformist practice is itself a dominant
feature of some brands of anarchism. For Hardt and Negri, migration
becomes the new vanguard activity---even though they reject vanguardism
as a political form. Evoking the Communist Manifesto, they state that "A
specter haunts the world and it is the specter of migration. All the
powers of the old world are allied in a merciless operation against it,
but the movement is irresistible" (213). "Migration" is here substituted
for Marx and Engels's original "Communism." The shift is emblematic. A
social process is substituted for a political party/subject. And this
has also been the dominant logic of social movements since the 1970s, as
James Heartfield has observed: "The real meaning of the 'new social
movements' is a move away from the idea of an agent of social
transformation altogether. The novel forms of organization are a break
with the idea of collective agency."35 The decline and defeat of the
working class as a political force from the late 1970s onwards has
indeed been the primary precondition for the rise of social movements
like "direct action," environmentalism, feminism, indigenism, NGOs, and,
today, the anticapitalist movement. Empire is quite explicit, therefore,
in its rejection of proletarian forms of political organization.
Internationalism is a case in point. Hardt and Negri are particularly
eager to dispel the notion that internationalism has any role to play in
contemporary politics. "Today we should all clearly recognize," they
state, "that the time of such proletarian internationalism is over"
(50). Globalization is a response to internationalism rather than a
result of its failure. Again, workers have "anticipated and prefigured
the processes of the globalization of capital and the formation of
Empire" (51). Global capital emulates international struggles, they
claim. Having prefigured Empire, proletarian internationalism has become
outmoded, its tactics and strategy "completely irretrievable" (59). As
"struggles have become all but incommunicable" (54), they "do not link
horizontally, but each one leaps vertically, directly to the virtual
center of Empire" (58). In a reversal of the shared antagonisms and
resemblances of proletarian internationalism, difference rules in
struggles today: "Enlightenment is the problem and postmodernism is the
solution" (140). But what sort of solution is it? Have the problems of
inequality, exploitation, and binary antagonisms generated by capitalism
really been resolved in postmodernity? Empire seems to have resolved
these problems away by performing a double evacuation: both of structure
and of agency. With the dilution of an objective power structure comes
the liquidation of a subject of liberation[. [If Empire is centerless,
then so is counter-Empire. Hardt and Negri's rejection of
internationalism is therefore premised on the flawed assumption that the
nation-state has disappeared]{.mark}, when, in fact, [it has only been
restructure]{.mark}d. If state power has not evaporated in
Empire/globalization but only been reconfigured, then their politics of
difference is an evasion of political action. Which means that the
moment of "the missed opportunities of international socialism" has not
become redundant.]{.underline}36 Neither has the strategy of capturing
state power as the main objective of revolutionary movements. As Marx
and Engels put it in the Manifesto: "Though not in substance, yet in
form, the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a
national struggle. The proletariat of each must, of course, first of all
settle matters with its own bourgeoisie."37 But who in postmodernity is
to counter and overcome "American internationalism," and guarantee that
"neoliberal cosmopolitanism"---its equally imperialist EU
competitor---is defeated as well? The real question is slightly
different, as Ralph Miliband observes: who is structurally capable of
transforming global capitalism and overcoming the logic of its
domination? Miliband had no doubts that it can only be the working
class, the subordinated majority. If the working class does not overcome
the rule of capital, then, quite simply, nobody else will: \[T\]he
"primacy" of organized labor in struggle arises from the fact that no
other group, movement or force in capitalist society is remotely capable
of mounting as effective and formidable a challenge to the existing
structures of power and privilege as it is in the power of organized
labor to mount. In no way is this to say that movements of women,
blacks, peace activists, ecologists, gays, and others are not important,
or cannot have effect, or that they ought to surrender separate
identity. Not at all. [[It is only to say that the principal]{.mark}
(not the only) "[gravedigger" of capitalism remains the organized
working class]{.mark}. Here is the necessary, indispensable "agency of
historical change." And if, as one is constantly told is the case, the
organized working class will refuse to do the job, then the job will not
be done]{.underline}.38 Put differently: only the "particularized
universalism" of socialist internationalism can counter the
"universalized particularism"39 of postmodern American internationalism.
The postmodern left has deserted this position and, in so doing, has
refused to acknowledge the unprecedented power of global capitalist
domination. Capitalism, it turns out, is not at all as all-powerful as
Marxists thought it was before the days of deconstruction. It is
actually "a paper tiger"40 and has no essential identity. [[Between such
denial and Hardt and Negri's euphoria, capitalism is left
unchallenged.]{.mark} Part of today's necessary "uncompromising realism"
is an appreciation of the force and truth of Miliband's statement above.
Only by "refusing any accommodation with the ruling system, and
rejecting every piety and euphemism that would understate its power"41
can a real appreciation of the tasks ahead be achieved. Idealism and
mystification will only undermine any re-emerging potential for real
transformation in the future.]{.underline}
