### 1NC\-\--AI CP\-\--American AI Initiative

#### Text: The United States federal government should invest in the American AI Initiative.

#### The CP solves --- the American AI Initiative enhances resources and development for national defense and security.

Intelligence Initiative Office, 2020 ("The American AI Initiative: The
U.S. strategy for leadership in artificial intelligence," *OECD AI

- [[The American AI Initiative focuses the resources]{.mark} of the
  Federal Government [in support of AI innovation that will increase
  prosperity, enhance national security, and improve quality of
  life]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the past year since the signing of the
  Executive Order, the United States has made significant progress on
  achieving the national strategy's objectives. [This national strategy
  is well-aligned with the OECD AI Principles and takes important action
  to support the development of trustworthy AI. The Initiative
  emphasizes the following key policies and practices:]{.underline}

- [[Invest in AI research and development]{.mark}: The United States
  must promotes Federal investment in AI R&D in collaboration with
  industry, academia, international partners and allies, and other
  non-Federal entities to generate technological breakthroughs in AI.
  President]{.underline} Trump called for a two-year and in 2019 the
  Administration developed the first and published the first-ever
  reporting of government-wide non-defense AI R&D spending.

- [[Unleash AI resources:]{.mark} The United States must
  [enhance]{.mark}s [access to high-quality Federal data, models, and
  computing resources to increase]{.mark} [their value for AI
  R&D]{.mark}]{.underline}, while maintaining and extending safety,
  security, privacy, and confidentiality protections. The American AI
  Initiative directs Federal agencies to increase access to and use of
  Federal data and models. In 2019, the White House Office of Management
  and Budget established the as a framework for operational principles
  and best practices for Federal agencies and how they use and manage
  data.

- [[Remove barriers to AI innovation]{.mark}: The United States reduces
  barriers to the safe development, testing, deployment, and adoption of
  AI technologies by providing guidance for the governance of AI
  consistent with our Nation's values and [by driving the development of
  appropriate AI technical standards]{.mark}. As part of the American AI
  Initiative, The White House proposed the a first-of-its-kind national
  AI regulatory policy that advances innovation underpinned by American
  values.]{.underline} In addition, the National Institute of Standards
  and Technology [(NIST) issued the first-ever]{.underline}

- [[Promote an international environment supportive of American AI
  innovation]{.mark}: The United States engages internationally to
  promote a global environment that supports American AI research and
  innovation and opens markets for American AI industries while ensuring
  that AI is developed in a matter consistent with our Nation's values,
  including protecting privacy, civil rights, and civil
  liberties]{.underline}. Last year, the United States joined with
  allies in historic efforts at the Organisation for Economic
  Cooperation and Development (OECD) to develop the first The United
  States supports OECD's ongoing work to implement these principles
  through the AI Policy Observatory and related activities.

- [[Embrace trustworthy AI for government services and missions]{.mark}:
  The United States embraces technology such as artificial intelligence
  to improve the provision and efficiency of government services to the
  American people and ensure its application upholds our Nation's
  values, including protecting privacy, civil rights, and civil
  liberties]{.underline}. The General Services Administration
  established and to enable Federal agencies to determine best practices
  for incorporating AI into their organizations.

- [[Train an AI-ready workforce]{.mark}: The United States empowers
  current and future generations of American workers through
  apprenticeships; skills programs; and education in science,
  technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), with an emphasis on
  computer science, to ensure that American workers are capable of
  taking full advantage of the opportunities of AI.]{.underline}
  President Trump directed all Federal agencies to prioritize AI-related
  apprenticeship and job training programs and opportunities. In
  addition to its R&D focus, the National Science Foundation's new
  program will also contribute to workforce development, particularly of
  AI researchers.

[[America's strong innovation ecosystem]{.mark}, fuelled by strategic
Federal investments, visionary scientists and entrepreneurs, and
renowned research institutions, [has propelled the United States to
global leadership in AI]{.mark}. However, [continued leadership]{.mark}
is not predetermined. Maintaining America's preeminent role in AI [can
only be realized by continually building upon our progress]{.mark} and
pursuing a strategic, forward-looking approach in partnership with
industry, academia, non-profit organizations, other non-Federal
entities, and like-minded international allies. Together, [we will shape
the trajectory of AI development for good]{.mark} --- enriching our
lives, promoting innovation, fostering trust and understanding, [and
ensur]{.mark}ing [our national defense and
security]{.mark}.]{.underline}

When the global economy starts to feel the shift ushered in with
mass-adoption of AI, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates needs [to be
leading the charge as opposed to chasing the pack]{.mark}.]{.underline}

If the U.S. is to compete on a global level, they'll face an arms race
of sorts from a litany of nations that are already doubling-down on the
massive advantages that come with national AI proficiency. In fact, 18
different countries have launched national AI strategies, with
government funding ranging from \$20 million to almost \$2 billion.

[[A first step in the right direction]{.mark} was taken by the Trump
administration recently when the president signed an executive order
[launching the American AI Initiative]{.mark}. This policy will funnel
federal funding and resources toward AI-specific research while also
implementing U.S.-led international AI standards. Additionally, the
program will call for new research into increasing AI literacy in
American workers.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, there are no specifics around what exactly this new
program actually looks like in practice, and there is no additional
research being dedicated toward AI development. There are no timelines
for implementation of these initiatives, only a vague goal of roughly
six-ish months before a detailed plan is rolled out. Jason Furman, a
Harvard professor who helped draft the Obama administration's report on
AI, said that the plan had "all the right elements" but was also
"aspirational with no details and is not self-executing."

Yet, [[the importance of government involvement in AI R&D cannot be
overstated]{.mark}. If we remain on the path we're on, one where large
technology companies and VC firms are funding the bulk of AI research,
[the country would only see pockets of growth]{.mark} around the largest
technology companies and the regions of the country would continue to
stagnate. We would not be able to work on major moonshot projects and
collectively pool our resources for the greater good across all regions
of the U.S. [All innovations would be tightly controlled by technology
companies and adoption rates would not move up and actually make a
difference in the way we utilize AI.]{.mark} This [would result in
a]{.mark} marginal [talent pool,]{.mark} [and new developments]{.mark}
would be those of technology innovators --- not problem-solvers.
Everything would be driven by its contribution to business and not its
contribution to society at-large.]{.underline}

[NIST is developing a framework to better manage risks to individuals,
organizations, and society associated with artificial intelligence (AI).
[The NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework]{.mark} (AI
RMF or Framework) [is intended for]{.mark} voluntary [use]{.mark} [and
to improve the ability to incorporate trustworthiness]{.mark}
considerations [into]{.mark} the design, development, use, and
evaluation of [AI]{.mark} products, services, and systems.]{.underline}

[[The Framework]{.mark} is being developed through a consensus-driven,
open, transparent, and collaborative process that will include workshops
and other [opportunities to provide input]{.mark}. It is intended [to
build on, align with, and support AI]{.mark} risk [management
efforts]{.mark} by others.]{.underline}

NIST's work on the Framework is consistent with its broader AI efforts,
recommendations by the National Security Commission on Artificial
Intelligence, and the Plan for Federal Engagement in AI Standards and
Related Tools. Congress has directed NIST to collaborate with the
private and public sectors to develop the AI RMF.

[[The Framework]{.mark} aims to [foster the development of innovative
approaches]{.mark} to address characteristics of trustworthiness
including accuracy, explainability and interpretability, reliability,
privacy, robustness, safety, security (resilience), [and]{.mark}
mitigation of unintended and/or harmful bias, as well as of harmful
uses. The Framework [should consider]{.mark} and encompass [principles
such as transparency, accountability, and fairness during pre-design,
design and development, deployment, use, and test]{.mark} and evaluation
[of AI]{.mark} technologies and systems. [These characteristics]{.mark}

[[Emphasizing the importance of]{.underline}]{.mark} artificial
intelligence ([[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}) [to the future of the U.S.
economy and national security]{.underline}, on February 11, 2019, [the
President issued an Executive Order]{.underline} (EO 13859) [directing
Federal agencies to [ensure that the nation maintains its leadership
position]{.mark} in AI.]{.underline} Among its objectives, [the EO aims
to "Ensure that technical standards...reflect Federal priorities for
innovation, public trust, and public confidence in systems that use AI
technologies...and develop international standards to promote and
protect those priorities."]{.underline}

[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates global [leadership in AI
depends]{.mark}]{.underline} up[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} [the Federal
government playing an active and purpose-driven role in AI standards
development.]{.underline} That includes AI standards-related efforts
needed by agencies to fulfill their missions by:

• [[supporting]{.mark} and conducting [AI research and
development]{.mark},]{.underline}

[• [actively engaging in AI standards]{.mark} development,]{.underline}

[• procuring and [deploying standards-based products and
services]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}]{.underline}

[• developing and [implementing supportive policies]{.mark}, [including
regulatory]{.mark} policies [where needed]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The EO directs the Secretary of Commerce, [through]{.mark}]{.underline}
the National Institute of Standards and Technology ([[NIST]{.mark}), to
issue "[a plan for Federal engagement]{.mark} in the development of
technical standards and related tools [in support of]{.mark} reliable,
robust, and trustworthy systems that use [AI tech]{.mark}nologies." This
plan was [prepared with broad public and private sector
input]{.mark}.]{.underline}

There are a number of cross-sector (horizontal) and sector-specific
(vertical) AI standards available now and many others are being
developed by numerous standards developing organizations (SDOs). Some
areas, such as communications, have well-established and regularly
maintained standards in widespread use, often originally developed for
other technologies. Other aspects, such as trustworthiness, are only now
being considered.

[[This plan identifies]{.mark} the following nine [areas of focus for
AI]{.mark} standards]{.underline}:

• [[Concepts]{.mark} and terminology]{.underline}

[• [Data]{.mark} and knowledge]{.underline}

[• [Human interactions]{.mark}]{.underline}

[• [Metrics]{.mark}]{.underline}

[• [Networking]{.mark}]{.underline}

[• Performance [testing and reporting]{.mark} methodology]{.underline}

[• [Safety]{.mark}]{.underline}

[• [Risk management]{.mark}]{.underline}

[• [Trustworthiness]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Trustworthiness standards include guidance and requirements for
accuracy, explainability, resiliency, safety, reliability, objectivity,
and security.]{.underline}

[It is important for [those participating in AI standards
development]{.mark} to [be aware of]{.mark}, and to act consistently
with, U.S[. government policies and principles]{.mark},
[including]{.mark} those that address societal and [ethical
issues]{.mark}, governance, and privacy.]{.underline} While there is
broad agreement that these issues must factor into AI standards, it is
not clear how that should be done and whether there is yet sufficient
scientific and technical basis to develop those standards provisions.

[[Standards should be complemented by]{.mark} related tools to advance
the development and adoption of effective, reliable, robust, and
trustworthy AI technologies. These [tools]{.mark}---[which]{.mark} often
have overlapping applications---[include]{.mark}, but are not limited
to:]{.underline}

[• [Data sets in standardized formats]{.mark},]{.underline} including
metadata for training, validation and testing of AI systems

[• [Tools for]{.mark} capturing and representing [knowledge]{.mark}, and
reasoning in AI systems]{.underline}

[• [Fully documented]{.mark} use [cases]{.mark} [that provide]{.mark} a
range of [data and info]{.mark}rmation about specific applications of AI
technologies and any standards or best practice guides used in making
decisions about deployment of these applications]{.underline}

[• [Testing methodologies]{.mark} to validate and evaluate AI
technologies' performance]{.underline}

[• [Metrics]{.mark} to quantifiably measure and characterize AI
technologies]{.underline}

[• Benchmarks, evaluations, and challenge [problems to drive
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}

[• [AI testbeds]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[• Tools for accountability]{.mark} and auditing]{.underline}

[U[.S]{.underline}]{.mark}[. government [agencies should prioritize
involvement in AI standards]{.mark} efforts [that are:]{.mark} inclusive
and [accessible,]{.mark} open and [transparent]{.mark},
[consensus-based, globally relevant, and
non-discriminator]{.mark}]{.underline}[y]{.mark}. This plan provides
guidance regarding important characteristics of standards to help
agencies in their decision making about AI standards. It also groups
potential agency involvement into four categories ranked from least- to
most-engaged: monitoring, participation, influencing, and leading[. [The
plan provides]{.mark} a series of practical [steps for agencies to
take]{.mark} as they decide [about]{.mark} engaging in [AI
standards]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The [Chinese have]{.mark} a very **[public]{.mark}**, very-deep,
extremely [**well-funded** commitment]{.mark} to AI]{.underline}. Air
Force General VeraLinn Jamieson says it plainly: \"We estimate the total
spending on artificial intelligence systems in China in 2017 was \$12
billion. We also estimate that it will grow to at least \$70 billion by
2020.\" According to the Obama White House Report in 2016, China
publishes more journal articles on deep learning than the US and has
increased its number of AI patents by 200%. China is determined to be
the world leader in AI by 2030.

Listen to what Tristan Greene writing in TNW concludes about the US's
commitment to AI: "Unfortunately, [despite congressional efforts to get
the conversation started at the national level in the US, the White
House's current leadership doesn't appear interested in coming up with a
strategy to keep up with China."]{.underline}  It gets worse: ["China
has allocated billions of dollars]{.underline} towards infrastructure to
house hundreds of AI businesses in dedicated industrial parks. It has
specific companies, the Chinese counterparts to US operations like
Google and Amazon, working on different problems in the field of AI. And
it's regulating education so that the nation produces more STEM workers.
But perhaps most importantly, China makes it compulsory for businesses
and private citizens to share their data with the government --
something far more valuable than money in the world of
AI.["]{.underline}

Greene's scary bottom line? "Meanwhile, in the US, [the [Trump]{.mark}
administration [has shown **little interest** in]{.mark} discussing its
own country's [AI]{.mark}]{.underline} -- yet, may soon have to talk to
China's."

More data? According to Iris Deng, "China ranks first in the quantity
and citation of research papers, and holds the most AI patents, edging
out the US and Japan ... (and) China has not been shy about its
ambitions for AI dominance, with the State Council releasing a road map
in July 2017 with a goal of creating a domestic industry worth 1
trillion yuan and becoming a global AI powerhouse by 2030."

It\'s obvious: ["[Without **more leadership**]{.mark} from Congress and
the President, [the U.S. is in serious danger of losing]{.mark} the
economic and military rewards of artificial intelligence (AI) to
China]{.underline}. That's the somber conclusion of a report published
\... by the House Oversight and Reform IT subcommittee.["]{.underline}

Jerry Bowles also says it clearly: "The U.S. has traditionally led the
world in the development and application of AI-driven technologies, due
in part to the government's commitment to investing heavily in research
and development. That has, in turn, helped support AI's growth and
development. In 2015, the United States led the world in total gross
domestic R&D expenditures, spending \$497 billion. But, since then,
[neither Congress nor the Trump administration has paid much attention
to AI and **government [R&D investment]{.mark}** [has been]{.mark}
essentially [flat]{.mark}]{.underline}. Meanwhile, China has made AI a
key part of its formal economic plans for the future."

The Response  

The US House of Representative's Subcommittee on Information Technology
Committee on Oversight & Government Reform summarizes it but
not definitively:

["[There is]{.mark} a [**pressing need** for]{.mark} conscious, direct,
and spirited [leadership]{.mark} from the Trump
Administration]{.underline}. The 2016 reports put out by the Obama
Administration's National Science and Technology Council and the recent
actions of the Trump Administration are steps in the right direction.
However, given the actions taken by other countries -- especially China
-- [Congress and the Administration will need to increase the time,
attention, and level of resources the federal government devotes to AI
research and development, as well as push for agencies to further build
their capacities for adapting to advanced technologies."]{.underline}

["[The government has an **essential role**]{.mark} to play in securing
American leadership in AI]{.underline}. Fulfilling this role will
require balancing the creative energy of innovative Americans whose
knowledge and entrepreneurial spirit have driven the development of this
technology with regulatory frameworks that protect consumers. To ensure
the appropriate balance is met, [it is vital Congress and the Executive
Branch continue to educate themselves about AI, [increase]{.mark} the
expenditures of [R&D]{.mark} funds, help [set]{.mark} the [agenda for
public debate]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}, where appropriate, [define]{.mark}
the [role of AI]{.mark} in the future of this nation."]{.underline}

Clearly, [a coordinated, heavily-funded American response is way
overdue]{.underline}. Here are some specific steps:

[The [individual]{.mark} American [states]{.mark} -- all 50 [and Puerto
Rico]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[need their own]{.mark} AI [investment
strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They should [appoint]{.mark}
[commissions and]{.mark}]{.underline}, ideally, [[Chief AI
Tech]{.mark}nology [Officers]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[State's should
aggressively fund]{.mark} AI [r]{.mark}esearch [and d]{.mark}evelopment,
[and partner with the fed]{.mark}eral [gov]{.mark}ernment where AI
intersects with problems all states face, like infrastructure,
healthcare and education, among others]{.underline}. 

[Private and public [universities should be funded]{.mark} by federal
and state governments [to develop ed]{.mark}ucational [programs in AI
and conduct]{.mark} basic and applied [research]{.mark} in
AI]{.underline}. [Block grants to universities should begin
immediately]{.underline}. 

[[Increased R&D tax incentives]{.mark} and credits [to companies who
invest]{.mark} specifically [in AI]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Primary and secondary]{.mark} educational programs should be
retrofitted with much deeper STEM content]{.underline}. [Longer school
years should begin immediately]{.underline}. [[Grants for
science]{.mark}, mathematics and computer science [ed]{.mark}ucation
[should be]{.mark} equally [awarded]{.mark} to public, private and
charter schools]{.underline}.    

[The US [response to China]{.mark}]{.underline} (and other nations
investing heavily in AI) [must obviously be aggressive and immediate,
which [includes]{.mark} leadership from the recently appointed White
House Science Advisor and the expansion of the Office of Scientific &
Technology Policy, well beyond an offset to major recent personnel cuts,
the [restoration of cuts to major science programs]{.mark} recently
eliminated by the Trump administration, [and]{.mark} the [creation of
major new programs in AI]{.mark}, machine learning and deep
learning]{.underline}.

[A [national AI Czar should be appointed]{.mark} with broad funding and
programmatic authority]{.underline}. [The Czar should be a Cabinet-level
official, similar to the Director of National
Intelligence]{.underline}. [The Director of Artificial Intelligence
should [oversee]{.mark} a national [r]{.mark}esearch [and
d]{.mark}evelopment program and serve as the principal advisor to the
President of the United States on all aspects of AI and intelligent
systems technology]{.underline}.

[Immigration policy regarding [**H-1B visas** for tech]{.mark}nology
[professionals should be]{.mark} broadly [widened]{.mark} and
eased]{.underline}. Rani Molla writing in recode reminds us that
"immigrants and their children have helped found 60 percent of the most
highly valued tech companies in the U.S., Kleiner Perkins Caufield &
Byers partner Mary Meeker told the Code Conference last year in her
annual internet trends report. Right now those companies -- which
include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Facebook -- have a combined market
value of \$3.8 trillion."

[[These steps]{.underline}]{.mark} represent a good start to [[turn the
tide of the AI war]{.underline}]{.mark} -- a war the US simply cannot
afford to lose.

[[Regulatory approval is a **long and uncertain** process]{.mark} in
many countries, and regulatory uncertainty is a significant concern to
both developers and academic]{.underline}

[researchers.]{.underline} The experience of AquaBounty, with a 20-year
regulatory and public acceptance pathway, has led to hesitancy among
companies to invest heavily in animal biotechnology[. [**Animal
agricultural** companies are awaiting examples of successful
applications to pave the way for public
acceptance]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The regulatory landscape for
[animal]{.mark} **[biotechnology is continuing to
evolve]{.mark}**]{.underline} globally, with growing distinction between
classical genetic modification using rDNA and more recent GnEd
approaches used to generate changes that could occur through mutagenesis
or conventional breeding. Unnecessary costs associated with
non-risk-based regulatory frameworks may limit developments.
[[Regulatory frameworks]{.mark} in some countries [are costly and
difficult to navigate]{.mark}, and can prove prohibitive to innovation,
especially for academics and small companies developing
technology.]{.underline} Public policies directly affect the choice of
research topics. For example, [basepair and gene deletions are easier to
gain approval for through regulatory pathways than insertions, and thus
research focuses on developing new traits through
deletions.]{.underline} In Canada, proponents must put an economic value
on a trait, which means that only highvalue traits are targeted. In
several countries, there are two or more agencies involved in the
approval of a

product. For example, in Australia food safety approval (conducted by
FSANZ) is distinct from approval of the animal for commercial release
(conducted by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator). In Canada,
[[it was recommended that a food safety evaluation be done for a]{.mark}
GnEd [animal although not required]{.mark}, as the trait was not novel,
[to ''make the public more comfortable.'']{.mark}]{.underline} Of great
concern to developers, breeders, and scientists are the lost opportunity
costs---every year that existing technology is not used means avoidable
costs in terms of disease prevention, animal welfare, and global food
security (Van Eenennaam et al. 2021). Public trust in regulatory
approaches and decisions is critical. Regulations may enable public
trust by reassuring the public that products are safe, but also may
generate safety concerns unsubstantiated by science (i.e., ''if this is
safe, then why is it so strictly regulated?''). Likewise, how the
product is regulated---e.g., as an animal drug or as a food animal ---
may alter consumer perception of safety in different

ways. [[This may be]{.mark} particularly **[confusing in]{.mark} [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates because a single nucleotide deletion in
plants is exempt from biotechnology regulation, yet the same type of
edit in an animal is regulated as a drug**. Further, [perception of
agricultural biotechnology is also closely tied to negative perceptions
of large corporations]{.mark}. Ironically, as seen most clearly with the
plant biotechnology sector,1 the costly regulatory process allows mainly
large corporations to gain approval of their products and limits
commercialization of products developed by the academic or public
sectors and small businesses, as well as limiting the type of traits
developed (Whelan et al. 2020).]{.underline} This situation likely
compounds public mistrust of such corporations and increases mistrust of
the products at issue. Developers

suggested that regulations should be streamlined so that small firms and
academic institutions also can afford the approval process and thereby
shift GM and GnEd products from the association with large corporations.
Overall[, science-based regulatory development and modernization was
recognized as a critical issue for moving animal biotechnology
forward.]{.underline} Marketing and trade As countries continue to
develop regulations, sharing guidelines and experience is key to
encouraging harmonization to enable international trade. Currently,
variation among regulatory systems and regulatory uncertainty have
limited international trade of animal biotechnology products in several
regions. [Moreover, [differences in definitions make tracing products of
biotechnology]{.mark}, when required, **[challenging and
expensive]{.mark}**. New products will likely have to be accepted on a
market-by-market basis as regulatory approaches and frameworks
develop.]{.underline} The challenge of regulatory approval has caused
companies to avoid pursuing marketing in some regions, while at the same
time still engaging with regions that have a large influence on global
developments (e.g., the European Union). [[Often developers will delay
the commercialization of new products until export is possible into
major markets]{.mark}, as demonstrated in the seed industry, where seeds
for new approved crops are not released until approvals in key markets
are obtained, [delaying farmer access to new traits]{.mark}. Mutual
recognition of regulatory decisions would facilitate trade and encourage
innovation.]{.underline} There is some alignment of regulatory processes
among South American countries. Labeling presents a particular challenge
for trade of products from GnEd animals that do not have new DNA
sequences or edits that distinguish them from conventionally-bred
animals. [[The need for labels based on process when two products cannot
be distinguished]{.mark} was questioned by researchers and developers.
Already a lot of information that could be provided on labels is not
(e.g., cattle breeds, antibiotic use), even when consumers may care
about these characteristics. Part of the challenge is to avoid
misleading consumers with labels when the meaning to the public is not
clear.]{.underline} The objective of the label needs to be critically
evaluated. In some cases, labeling products of GnEd could be beneficial
if the product develops a reputation for sustainability or improved
safety and may occur voluntarily, although this is far from certain.
Marketing and trade require some degree of agreement or mutual
understanding relative to regulatory processes among trading partners.
With GM products developed with rDNA insertion, the regulatory processes
and timelines are not harmonized globally, resulting in asynchronous
approvals. [There is only one GM animal developed for food use on the
market; therefore, [it is necessary to look to the plant biotechnology
sector for examples and analysis of impacts of regulatory
approaches]{.mark}. However, historically there has been general
agreement among most countries regarding the definition of rDNA-derived
plants and animals and what types of products are
regulated.]{.underline} **[One major challenge with lack of
harmonization of regulatory approaches for products of GnEd could be
that different countries will make differing determinations as to the
types of GnEd products that are regulated as conventional products
versus those that will be regulated under their GMO
regulations.]{.underline}**

### 2NC\-\--Animal Biotech CP

#### Animal Biotech spill up to all biotechnology. 

**Quarles 20** --- Ryan Quarles, Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner and
President of the National Association of State Departments of
Agriculture, 2020 ("Opinion: A Healthy and resilient world needs animal
biotech innovation," *Agri Pulse*, September 30^th^, Available Online at
https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/14589-opinion-a-healthy-and-resilient-world-needs-animal-biotech-innovation,
Accessed 07-13-2022)

[[The COVID-19 crisis has delivered a devastating blow to]{.mark} every
segment of our society, and [our nation's agriculture sector]{.mark} is
no exception. **[Our food supply chain has been tested]{.mark}; our
rural [economies are suffering]{.mark}**; and our farmworkers are on the
front lines of risk. The need for innovation and resilient solutions has
never been more urgent.]{.underline}

These unprecedented challenges were top of mind during the recent annual
meeting of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture
(NASDA). [I'm very proud that NASDA has adopted a new vision statement:
"[Agriculture leads the way toward a healthy and resilient
world]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[Fundamental to this idea of resilience is the role of innovation.
America has always been the global leader in agriculture innovation, and
we have made some great strides. But our regulatory system for animal
agriculture -- specifically animal biotechnology -- has not kept pace
with science.]{.underline}

The pandemic continues to remind us about the importance of the One
Health initiative adopted by the federal government to better understand
the link between human and animal diseases. Sixty percent of human
diseases begin in animals. As populations grow and move, zoonotic
diseases will become more prevalent and potentially more dangerous.

One Health solutions, many made possible through biotechnology, can
protect the health of our livestock, enhance human health, safeguard our
economy, and strengthen our systems for preventing and responding to
future outbreaks.

[[Biotechnology]{.mark}, for example, [can arm pigs with resistance to
African Swine Fever]{.mark}, protect American pork producers from
significant economic loss, and create resiliency in our nation's food
supply. Scientists have also developed a chicken that is resistant to
contracting and transmitting avian influenza. And researchers are using
gene editing to make pigs resistant to Porcine Reproductive and
Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS)]{.underline}.

The economic benefits alone would be considerable. The 2015 outbreak of
avian influenza cost the United States \$3.3 billion. And a recent Iowa
State University study estimates that an African Swine Fever outbreak in
the United States could cost up to \$50 billion. PRRS -- a viral disease
affecting the U.S. pork industry -- already costs upwards of \$664
million annually.

More urgent perhaps is the potential human health impacts. [[Advances in
animal biotechnology can help prevent]{.mark}, prepare for, and respond
to outbreaks of infectious diseases such as [**COVID-19, Ebola, MERS,
Zika, among others**, by providing prevention strategies and treatments
for humans.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The need for science-based solutions is urgent, but these breakthroughs
are being held back by an awkward and unworkable regulatory system.

[The U.S. animal biotechnology regulatory process -- currently under the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -- is confusing, unpredictable, and
in dire need of reform.]{.underline} For technology developers, there is
no way to know how long it will take, or how much it will cost before
products are approved for market.

There has been only one food animal approved to date. AquaBounty's
salmon, genetically engineered to grow to market size twice as fast
using 25 percent less feed than traditional salmon, was under
consideration by the FDA for more than two decades. Most small companies
can't survive such delays and red tape.

[If there were a clearer path to commercialization, U.S. companies,
start-ups, universities, and independent researchers could be developing
cutting edge solutions, bolstering local economies, and creating
high-paying jobs. Instead, animal biotech researchers and investors are
moving to other countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and
China.]{.underline}

Part of the problem is FDA's approach, which requires these animals to
be regulated under the "New Animal Drug" model. It creates potential
problems for farmers and ranchers to have their animals treated as
"drugs" and their farms to be regulated as "drug manufacturing
facilities."

Over the past decade, [[both the Obama and Trump administrations have
stepped up efforts to streamline biotechnology regulations]{.mark},
especially for crops and plants. Now we must do the same for our animal
biotech sector.]{.underline}

One potential solution is an agreement between the FDA and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA, with expertise in food
production, could lead regulatory oversight of genetically modified and
gene-edited food animals. The FDA could maintain authority over animal
biotechnology for biomedical purposes.

[[The FDA should also reexamine its process and make the necessary
changes so decision-making is risk-based, consistent, and
**streamlined**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Stakeholders need to have
confidence that the FDA pathway to commercialization is clear and that
timelines are reasonable and predictable.

As NASDA's new president, I urge our federal officials to prioritize
innovation, commit to long-range policies, cooperate with each other,
and act thoughtfully. We need policies that will redefine agriculture
toward a healthy and resilient world. Innovation is essential to making
that goal a reality.

## Baltic War CP

### 1NC\-\--Baltic War CP\-\--Suwalki CP

#### The United States federal government should increase its military protection in the area of the Suwalki Corridor.

#### The Counterplan protects the Baltic Region from a Ukraine-esk attack by Russia\-\-- boosts NATO confidence in their most exposed members

**Deni 22,** John R, 3-3-2022, a research professor at the U.S. Army War
College's Strategic Studies Institute and a nonresident senior fellow at
the Atlantic Council. \"NATO Must Prepare to Defend Its Weakest
Point---the Suwalki Corridor,\" Foreign Policy,

[As the Biden administration monitors Moscow's reaction to]{.underline}
dramatic U.S. and allied increases in [assistance to
Ukraine]{.underline} as well as the punishing Western economic and
financial sanctions on Russia, [it should turn its focus to
a]{.underline} relatively [small corner of northeastern
Europe]{.underline} that is familiar to military strategists but often
overlooked by most policymakers and the general public.

[The Suwalki corridor]{.underline} (also known as the Suwalki Gap)
[separates]{.underline} the Russian exclave of [Kaliningrad on the
Baltic Sea from Belarus]{.underline}, now [host to thousands of Russian
troops and]{.underline} soon home to [permanent]{.underline}ly stationed
[Russian forces, including]{.underline} advanced [fighter jets and
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. [It is also the only way to get by road or
rail from Poland and Central Europe to the Baltic
states]{.underline}---arguably [NATO's most exposed
members.]{.underline}

A Russian move to seize control of the corridor may seem far-fetched, as
it would explicitly involve an attack on NATO territory, triggering a
U.S. military response. Nonetheless, [if **Moscow's reinvasion of
Ukraine** has any]{.underline} central **[lesson]{.underline}** to offer
at this point, it's that [**U.S. and allied officials must prepare now
for worst-case scenarios** by **focusing on**]{.underline} actual
[**Russian military capabilities** in the region]{.underline}, rather
than the Kremlin's announced intent, considered estimates of Russia's
strategic logic, or intelligence assessments of Russian President
Vladimir Putin's outlook.

Forty miles wide as the crow flies, the Suwalki corridor isn't much of a
corridor, at least in terms of natural boundaries such as rivers,
coastlines, or mountains. Driving through the area last October while on
a research trip to NATO units, I found it a wide-open rural region,
predominantly characterized by rolling farmland interspersed with
forests and small villages. [Much of it is ideal terrain for tracked
vehicles like tanks]{.underline}, given the very limited roadways and
the gentle hills.

Two highways---one with two lanes each way, the other with just a single
lane each way---plus a rail line, are all the ground-based
transportation infrastructure that connect Poland with the Baltic
states. Since Russia's first invasion of Ukraine, in 2014, Western
government officials, military leaders, and think tank experts have paid
extra attention to this relatively narrow passageway between allies,
primarily because of the chokepoint it represents should Russia seek to
cut off the Baltics.

[These concerns have only amplified]{.underline} in the last week, [as
Western officials weigh whether assistance to Ukraine might paint the
West as co-combatants in the eyes of i]{.underline}nternational
[law]{.underline}, [providing Putin with a justification for lashing
out.]{.underline} It's also possible **[Moscow might respond militarily
to the debilitating sanctions]{.underline}** imposed by the West in the
last week, in an echo of imperial Japan's 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor
following the imposition of a U.S. oil export embargo. Or [**as** U.S.
and other **allied forces stream** **into the Baltic** Sea]{.underline}
and NATO's eastern flank, [the **Kremlin may perceive** an **increased
threat** to Kaliningrad **and seize**]{.underline} the
**[Suwalk]{.underline}i** corridor to create a land bridge to the
exclave.

[Kaliningrad]{.underline}---formerly Königsberg---has been Russian
territory since the end of World War II, and it's [now home
to]{.underline} substantial [Russian combat forces, including the
Russian Baltic Fleet]{.underline}, advanced air defenses, and mobile
nuclear-capable Iskander-M missiles. Given this, Russia is particularly
sensitive to any perceived threats to its control of the noncontiguous
territory and might risk escalation if it misinterpreted NATO's actions
near Kaliningrad.

Obviously, **[seizing the Suwalki]{.underline}** corridor **[would
entail attacking Lithuania or Poland or both]{.underline}**,
[leading]{.underline} directly [to]{.underline} a [war between NATO and
Russia]{.underline}. This seems illogical or at best strategically
unwise for Putin. However, the West's ability to know and understand
Putin's logic and the rationale behind his decision-making has been
obviously constrained by a lack of imagination, quality intelligence, or
both.

For instance, some thought it was illogical for Putin to order the
full-scale invasion of Ukraine if his objective was simply to keep it
out of NATO. The simmering Donbass conflict had effectively achieved
this since 2014, since one of the informal requirements for alliance
membership is a lack of territorial disputes with neighbors.

### 2NC\-\-- Baltic War CP\-\-- Suwalki CP\-\--Solvency

#### Protecting the Suwalki corridor staves off Baltic severance\-\--nuclear war

**Karnitschnig 22**,Matthew, 6-20-2022, POLITICO's chief Europe

The worry is that [**in** a **conflict with the West**, **Russia could**
sweep into the corridor simultaneously from the east and the west,
**sever**ing the European Union's **Baltic countries from their allies**
to the south]{.underline}. "It's a huge vulnerability because an
invasion would cut off Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia from the rest of
NATO," said Ilves.

[Such a move would also result in an immediate **faceoff between Moscow
and NATO's nuclear-armed members, pushing the world to the brink of
world-ending confrontation**.]{.underline}

Ilves' warning to von der Leyen, now president of the European
Commission, was a reaction to Russia's annexation of Crimea the year
before, but his [doomsday scenario has gained new credence in the wake
of Putin's latest invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline}

Just as Putin is trying to create a land bridge between Russia and the
Crimea peninsula, [taking the Suwałki Gap]{.underline}, which is named
for a prominent town on the Polish side of the border, [could link
Russian troops in Kaliningrad, a key Russian outpost, with those
stationed in its de facto protectorate Belarus.]{.underline}

[In Kaliningrad, Russia has built a formidable military presence,
spanning nuclear weapons, its Baltic fleet and tens of thousands of
soldiers.]{.underline} (The exclave, which has a population of nearly 1
million, was German territory until after World War II, when it was
known as Königsberg. The Soviet Union wrested control of the region from
Germany after the war, renamed it Kaliningrad and expelled the German
population.)

While there's no reason to suggest an attack is imminent, [the Russian
leader appears to delight in keeping the West guessing what his next
move will be.]{.underline} Earlier this month, [he praised the imperial
exploits of Peter the Great, declaring that "a country is either a
sovereign or a colony," comments that did little to reassure the
Baltics.]{.underline} Mikhail Kasyanov, a former Russian prime minister
under Putin, added more fuel to the fire last week, predicting that
**["the Baltic states will be next" if Ukraine falls.]{.underline}**

The expected [NATO accession of Sweden and Finland]{.underline} has
further raised tensions between Russia and the alliance. The addition of
the two Scandinavian countries might make it more difficult for Russia
to sever the Baltics from the rest of the alliance, but it
[would]{.underline} also [turn the Baltic Sea into what some are calling
a NATO lake, perhaps giving Moscow even more of an incentive to build a
bridge to Kaliningrad.]{.underline}

But while the door to immediate NATO membership was closed, external
assistance was on offer. Taking the lead in this effort were the Nordic
countries, particularly the NATO member Denmark. The Nordic countries
and the Baltics agreed that a peacekeeping-oriented international
arrangement, the Baltic Battalion (**[BALTBAT]{.underline}**), could
[serve as a vehicle for quickly **bolstering Baltic
security**]{.underline}. This was for two reasons. First, [BALTBAT was,
in the words of one commentator with some involvement in the project, of
"symbolic and political importance.]{.underline}" 16 By creating and
cooperating through [BALTBAT, the Baltic states signaled their
willingness to find joint solutions to security problems. In other
words, they demonstrated a desire and ability to fulfill a core function
of NATO: provide collective defense.]{.underline} Second, BALTBAT
facilitated the distribution of technical assistance and material
resources from the established democracies to the Baltics. With respect
to technical assistance, established democracies offered training in
"Western" practices of military organization (such as the proper role of
civil-military relations), and even English language classes (as English
proficiency is necessary for operating within NATO). With respect to
material assistance, [through BALTBAT the Baltic states received

There are a wide range of strategies for addressing climate change, from
actions that aim to reduce the buildup of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere (climate mitigation) to those that help nature and people
proactively prepare for and adapt to the impacts of a changing climate
(climate adaptation). [**Natural Climate Solutions (also called
"nature-based solutions to climate change") are conservation,
restoration, and improved land management actions that remove carbon
from the atmosphere while also safeguarding biodiversity** and providing
benefits to people such as clean air and water, and protection from
climate disturbances such as floods and wildfire.]{.underline}

[A recent study in the journal Science Advances estimated that up to 21%
of the U.S.'s current annual greenhouse gas emissions can be removed
from the atmosphere by restoring and responsibly managing our forests,
farms, ranches, grasslands, and wetlands. The protection, restoration,
and responsible management of natural resources is also a key strategy
for adapting to the impacts of climate change.]{.underline} The Global
Adaptation Commission, World Economic Forum, and United Nations Decade
on Ecosystem Restoration have called for greater investment in the
natural environment as a cost-effective and critical part of building
resilience for human communities, while helping fish, plants and animals
thrive in the face of a changing climate. When carefully planned and
implemented, nature-based solutions can offer both climate mitigation
and adaptation benefits by reducing emissions and helping people cope
with an altered environment. Although most investments in climate action
have focused on mitigation to-date, support for adaptation activities is
growing. It is essential that we increase our investment in climate
adaptation strategies alongside climate mitigation actions; the latter
may slow impacts and help give time for people and nature to adjust to
climate changes and its impacts.

[One of the most impactful Natural Climate Solutions for both adaptation
and mitigation is to protect and restore intact forests, grasslands, and
coastal ecosystems, whether in the U.S. or across the
planet.]{.underline} Globally, intact forests -- forest areas free of
significant anthropogenic degradation -- are indispensable to any viable
pathway for achieving net zero carbon by 2050 and keeping global warming
below 2°C. [They function as a massive ongoing carbon sink that absorbs
over 25% of humanity's global emissions every year. Intact forests also
support important adaptation and other social and economic co-benefits,
including:]{.underline}

[- Enhancing ecological resilience, by sustaining regional rainfall and
reducing vulnerability to fire, droughts, floods, etc.;]{.underline}

[- Conserving the biological diversity essential to maintaining
ecological functions, adaptation and resilience;]{.underline}

[- Sustaining the livelihoods and cultures of Indigenous Peoples and
Local Communities. Well over 35% of the world's most intact forests are
home to Indigenous Peoples;]{.underline}

[- Delivering cost-effective social benefits such as functioning
watersheds, food security and reduced disease transmission;]{.underline}

Currently, global and national commitments to mitigate climate change
fail to recognize the critical role of the planet's intact forests. The
planet's vast terrestrial carbon sink is incorrectly assumed to be
secure and too remote to face serious threats, leading to a lack of
political and financial commitments. If the existing carbon stocks and
ongoing sequestration capacity of intact forests (including peatlands)
are not maintained, humanity may find that all safe climate mitigation
pathways are out of reach. **[The U.S. Government has a critical role to
play in acknowledging the foundational, stabilizing role that intact
forests across the globe play for climate change mitigation and
adaptation, and support necessary policy change, governmental action,
and adequate finance for their protection.]{.underline}**

Intact forest protection will play an important role here in the U.S.,
but also important will be the protection and restoration of other
intact ecosystems, such as grasslands and coastal and marine ecosystems,
and the responsible management of multiple-use lands towards climate
mitigation, climate adaptation, biodiversity conservation, and social
well-being goals. Not only do these Natural Climate Solutions offer
cost-effective approaches, but they also help create jobs and can play a
key role in economic recovery.

The Role of Federal Lands, Programs, and Leadership

In the United States, the U.S. Government has an outsized role to play
in advancing Natural Climate Solutions. According to the Congressional
Research Service, the U.S. Government owns 640 million acres,
approximately 28% of all land in the U.S. Opportunities abound for
increasing the contribution that these lands -- and U.S. freshwater
systems and marine areas -- are making towards climate change mitigation
and adaptation.

[Natural Climate Solutions are already being implemented in the U.S., on
both public and private lands:]{.underline}

[- In New Mexico, Federal and private partners are restoring wetlands in
areas at high risk of burning in the Valles Caldera National Preserve, a
unit of the National Park Service.]{.underline} By establishing zones of
wet ecosystems in advance of a fire, these actions serve to reduce
catastrophic changes from hotter fires by breaking up the landscape and
reducing fire spread. After a fire, these wetlands are a repository for
soil that erodes during heavier rain events that are projected to
increase as the climate changes, providing protection to downstream
communities from flooding and contaminated water supplies.

[- Across the U.S., bison conservation efforts are protecting and
rewilding some of the most threatened, carbon-rich ecosystems in North
America: grasslands.]{.underline} As a keystone species and ecological
engineer, bison deliver a cascade of ecological benefits for myriad
species and ecosystems, as well as provide Natural Climate Solutions.
Culturally, buffalo contribute to the identity of many Indigenous
communities. Their restoration can therefore create a path for respect,
reconciliation, justice, and equity through Indigenous and community-led
conservation initiatives.

[- In Arctic Alaska, conservation groups are advocating for greater
protection of large protected areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge, rather than converting it to oil and gas
production.]{.underline} Protection of these large, intact landscapes
presents wildlife with the time and space to adapt to climate changes
while also reducing the severity of climate changes being felt around
the globe by reducing fossil fuel-related emissions.

[- In Tennessee, the Cumberland River Compact and partners are building
urban rain gardens to capture heavy downpours from climate change-driven
increases in intense rain events, to keep polluted runoff out of rivers
that are a drinking water source for local communities and also critical
fish and wildlife habitat.]{.underline}

[- In the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, American Forests and their
partners are designing reforestation projects in ways that provide
carbon benefits while also helping wildlife adapt to a changing
climate.]{.underline} They are planting drought-tolerant tree species
that can withstand warmer and drier conditions, store carbon, and
provide habitat, in critical riparian corridors that allow wildlife to
move and track changing conditions to survive.

[- In North Carolina, the Pocosin Lake National Wildlife Refuge is a
freshwater bog ecosystem spanning over 1,325 acres. The Nature
Conservancy and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are protecting this
area from climate change-driven fluctuations in precipitation patterns
and increased wildfires.]{.underline} They installed water control
structures that regulate the water level of the soil, which keeps the
bogs wet and reduces the risk of wildfires, protects biodiversity and
rare species that live in the pocosin, and increases carbon
sequestration.

[These examples and many others across the country offer inspiration and
models that can be replicated; however, the scale at which Natural
Climate Solutions are currently being implemented in the U.S. falls
short of what is needed to address the problem. **To meet the scope and
scale of the climate crisis, the U.S. Government must accelerate
science-based, participatory, and socially equitable investments in the
protection and responsible stewardship of our Federal lands and waters,
that anticipate future climate conditions.**]{.underline} And although
this expanded Federal role is essential, the U.S. Government cannot
address the climate crisis on public lands alone. [Increased Federal

CROSSINGS BY

On May 20th, 2022, **[the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators
(NCEL) released a[ letter to President
Biden](https://www.ncelenviro.org/app/uploads/2022/05/NCEL-NBS-Sign-On-Letter.pdf) urging
him to develop a national biodiversity strategy.]{.underline}**

Our planet is amidst a catastrophic biodiversity crisis, a crisis so
harmful that states alone cannot solve it. [U.S. states have been
working diligently to conserve their plants and wildlife, but the
threats to biodiversity come in various forms and don't adhere to state
boundaries; we must look to the federal government for help. This
biodiversity strategy would not only protect, restore, and secure the
prosperous biodiversity found throughout our nation but also solidify a
better world for future generations.]{.underline}

The biodiversity loss crisis we face is only worsening as time goes on
so it is critical that we take the necessary actions to combat this
issue in an austere and rigorous manner.

[The NCEL letter states that "The global scientific consensus is that as
many as one million species are at risk of extinction" and that "Studies
have shown that we are losing species and their habitats faster than
ever before."]{.underline}

As we continue to waste time thoughtlessly debating the severity of this
issue, countless species are declining and habitats are degrading, which
leads to humans losing essential ecosystem benefits that supply us with
clean water, fertile soils, and the very air and food we survive off of.
There are also several evident economic impacts of biodiversity loss.
The [World Economic Forum's 2022 Global Risk
Report](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2022.pdf) identified
biodiversity loss as the third most severe risk on a global scale over
the next ten years.

The second most severe risk is extreme weather, and the first most
severe risk is climate action failure. 

This letter addresses the bold efforts to combat the biodiversity crisis
already made by the Biden-Harris administration. [America the Beautiful
initiative](https://www.doi.gov/priorities/america-the-beautiful) addresses
both habitat destruction and climate change, two key driving forces of
biodiversity loss.

The Department of the Interior, Departments of Agriculture and Commerce,
National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, and the White House's
Council on Environmental Quality have been issued by President Biden to
work together to conserve, connect, and restore 30% of our nation's
lands and waters by 2030 to better our economy, health, and well-being. 

[Finally, **the letter lays out what a national biodiversity strategy
should look like. It should address all five driving forces of
biodiversity loss and include a plan to secure and restore essential
ecosystem services, advance social equity and environmental justice, and
coordinate a powerful and effective national response to combatting the
biodiversity crisis on a national and global scale. **]{.underline}

[Nearly 200 countries have developed various forms of biodiversity
strategies, but the United States is not one of them, according to a
coalition of conservation groups that wants the Biden administration to
create a national biodiversity strategy in a bid to slow the sixth mass
extinction.]{.underline}

Worldwide, 1 million species are threatened with extinction, according
to Defenders of Wildlife, Earthjustice, World Wildlife Fund,
International Fund for Animal Welfare, Wildlife Conservation Society,
and the Natural Resources Defense Council. Against that threat, the
United States must adopt an effective, whole-of-government approach to
prevent the loss of species, \"the collapse of ecosystems, and the
increasing threats these pose to our health, security and well-being,\"
the groups said in a joint release. 

[**The United States lacks a comprehensive and coordinated approach to
tackling the five main drivers of the biodiversity crisis: habitat loss,
direct exploitation of species, climate change, pollution, and invasive
species, the groups said in urging the Biden administration to establish
a national biodiversity strategy**.]{.underline}

[**There is support for such an initiative, as 120 environmental
organizations, leading scientists, and university students across the
country back its creation**, the organizations said. The movement is
also gaining
significant [support](https://www.onemillionspecies.org/supporters) in
Congress, led by Rep. Joe Neguse, a Colorado Democrat, and in several
state legislatures, including in New Mexico, where a resolution calling
for a national strategy sponsored by Senate President Pro Tempore Mimi
Stewart is advancing.]{.underline}

"We are at a pivotal moment in history. As human activity continues to
threaten the health and well-being of our planet's wildlife and
biodiversity, it is with the utmost urgency that the United States must
take this opportunity to be a world leader in conservation and climate
action," said Rep. Neguse, chair of the U.S. Subcommittee on National
Parks, Forests and Public Lands. "Establishing a whole-of-government
approach will help to preserve our environment not only for ourselves,
but for all generations to come."

"New Mexico has the fourth-highest native species richness of any state.
We are proud to lead the way to support a national biodiversity
strategy," said New Mexico Senate President Pro Tempore Mimi
Stewart. "We must do everything we can to protect our vital biodiversity
now and for future generations."

Building on the momentum of Rep. Neguse's proposal for a national
biodiversity strategy detailed in [H.Res.
69](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/69),
which currently has 39 cosponsors, Rep. Neguse and 49 cosigners brought
the issue directly to the White House this week with
a [letter ](https://www.onemillionspecies.org/_files/ugd/2cc790_5bb006b48b8a46a1918bd8ead2ebb263.pdf)highlighting
the urgent need to combat the extinction crisis.  

"Biodiversity is the foundation our planet is built on. We all depend on
nature and the richness of species within it," said Jamie Rappaport
Clark, president and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife. "If the extinction
crisis continues unabated, our nation will lose our unique landscapes,
wildlife and biodiversity forever. It is imperative for President Biden
to establish a national biodiversity strategy before it's too late."  

"Simply put, biodiversity functions as a critical life support system
across the entirety of our shared planet," said Azzedine Downes, CEO of
the International Fund for Animal Welfare. "It is as fundamental and
foundational to all natural systems that support human health and
livelihoods. Addressing the biodiversity crisis is essential to
protecting against future pandemics as well as to meeting our urgent
goals related to climate change. A robust future where both humans,
wildlife and the natural environment thrive can only be achieved by
elevating biodiversity protection to the highest priority."

[**A national biodiversity strategy would address the extinction
crisis** by requiring more effective and coordinated use of laws and
policies to protect biodiversity and reverse its decline, **while
reasserting the United States' international leadership in advance of
the next meeting of the Parties to the Convention on Biological
Diversity**. It would help protect and retain highly intact ecosystems,
secure and restore ecosystems and their services, promote environmental
justice and coordinate local, state, tribal, federal, and private
landholder efforts to tackle the biodiversity crisis while also
complementing the Biden administration's other habitat loss and climate
change initiatives. ]{.underline}

"The U.S. must take action to address the biodiversity crisis that
continues to worsen alongside the climate emergency because our own fate
is inextricably linked to the plants and animals with which we share
this planet. By showing leadership and establishing a national strategy,
President Biden can take concrete steps to prevent extinctions, like
restoring and strengthening the Endangered Species Act and investing in
species recovery," said Addie Haughey, legislative director at
Earthjustice.

Ginette Hemley, senior vice president for Wildlife Conservation, World
Wildlife Fund, pointed out that "In 2020, WWF's Living Planet report
showed that the overall abundance of wildlife populations globally has
declined by more than two-thirds in just 50 years. This shocking number
reinforces the alarms many scientists have sounded about the dangerous
decline of our planet's biodiversity and the urgent need to reverse this
trend. This matters to all of us, because the health of nature underpins
our own health and prosperity, as well as our long-term security. [The
United States has long been a leader in efforts to protect nature
globally, but it also needs to lead by example. This is why we believe
the Administration should put in place a strategic, whole-of-government
approach to conserving America's rich biodiversity while also taking
stronger steps to ensure nature-positive growth and economic
development, both at home and abroad.]{.underline}" 

"Biodiversity loss is inextricably linked to the other great crises
threatening our planet: climate change and zoonotic pandemics," said
John Calvelli, executive vice president of public affairs for the
Wildlife Conservation Society. "Protecting biodiversity is the
foundation we must build on to help safeguard our planet's life support
systems now and into the future. We urge the Biden Administration to
establish a national biodiversity strategy because life on earth depends
on a vibrant, healthy, and biodiverse planet."

for a National Biodiversity Strategy,\" National Caucus of Environmental
Legislators,

CROSSINGS BY

[Today more than 360 state legislators sent a letter to President Biden
urging the creation of a National Biodiversity strategy to address the
biodiversity crisis we're facing.]{.underline} As species and habitats
are disappearing at record rates, we need a unified national solution.
The United States is one of the only nations without such a national
strategy. [The bipartisan letter was signed by 365 legislators from 48
states and territories.]{.underline}

The letter's release coincides with Endangered Species Day. Globally,
there are around one million species at risk of extinction. The
unprecedented loss in species and habitats directly impacts our
security, economy, health, and well-being. Our biodiversity provides us
with crucial ecosystem services needed for clean water, healthy soils,
nutritious food, and clean air. 

["The biodiversity crisis is not just a global phenomenon. It's
impacting plant and animal species across this nation," said North
Carolina State Representative Pricey Harrison. "There is an urgent need
for a National Biodiversity Strategy so that states can act with
confidence to slow the loss of the diversity of life."]{.underline}

The main drivers of biodiversity loss are fueled by human activity and
include habitat destruction, climate change, wildlife exploitation,
pollution, and invasive species. 

[**States and the federal government are working on addressing habitat
destruction and climate change through the American the Beautiful
Initiative** **and 30×30 legislation.** This year, [at least 12
states](https://www.ncelenviro.org/issue/30x30/) considered legislation
to protect 30% of land and water by 2030. ]{.underline}

[However, for a comprehensive and national approach to the biodiversity
crisis, wildlife exploitation, pollution, and invasive species must be
addressed.]{.underline} Over the past two years, we've seen the impacts
that overexploitation of wildlife and habitat destruction can have on
public health and the economy through the COVID-19 zoonotic pandemic.
With 75% of emerging diseases being zoonotic in origin, states such
as [Oregon](https://www.ncelenviro.org/articles/oregon-passes-wildlife-disease-legislation/) and [Maryland](https://www.ncelenviro.org/articles/maryland-passes-wildlife-trafficking-ban/) are
working to prevent the next pandemic by curbing the spread of wildlife
diseases and addressing wildlife trafficking within state borders. 

[In addition, **[four
states](https://www.quorum.us/spreadsheet/external/gFimagZhVERxLqkWyktH/) have
already introduced memorials
or [tributes](https://www.ncelenviro.org/articles/colorado-tribute-supports-protection-of-biodiversity/) in
support of a National Biodiversity Strategy**. The [Vermont
legislature](https://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2022/H.606) has
also passed a bill specifically to protect its state's
biodiversity.]{.underline}

"Biodiversity refers to every living thing on earth and protecting this
mosaic of life helps preserve Colorado as we know it," said Colorado
State Representative Alex Valdez. "That's why, alongside several of my
colleagues, I read a Tribute on the House floor on this issue during
Earth Week 2022 to show support for a National Biodiversity Strategy."

"Washington is part of a growing number of states introducing
legislation in support of a National Biodiversity Strategy as means of
reducing the catastrophic impacts associated with the rapid rate of
biodiversity loss," said Washington State Senator Liz Lovelett. "It is
imperative that we do everything possible to protect biodiversity,
including keystone species like our state's beloved Southern Resident
Orca and iconic salmon that are fundamental to our environment and
cultural vitality. Biodiversity is essential to the security, health,
and well-being of our people and planet. That's why I support state
action on this urgent issue and think this letter is so important."

[However, **state action isn't enough**. Just as biodiversity doesn't
recognize state borders, this crisis cannot be solved with a piecemeal
approach. **States, therefore, call for a unified and united
approach. **]{.underline}

"New Mexico is a land of great biodiversity and many varied ecosystems,
all of which make New Mexico a true land of enchantment," said New
Mexico Senator Mimi Stewart. ["States like New Mexico are leading the
call for a national biodiversity strategy to deal with the biodiversity
crisis that is impacting all of our states."]{.underline}

[In addition to a call from 365 state legislators, the [movement for a
National Biodiversity
Strategy](https://defenders.org/newsroom/environmental-organizations-federal-and-state-leaders-call-national-biodiversity-strategy) is
supported by environmental organizations nationwide]{.underline}.

"The foundation of nature and life itself is crumbling rapidly,"
said Jamie Rappaport Clark, President and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife.
"The Biden administration can and must take bold and unprecedented
action to combat the biodiversity crisis. The message is clear from
federal, state, and NGO leaders. The United States needs a national
biodiversity strategy. We thank these policymakers for demonstrating the
leadership with the urgency needed to address this problem."  

[**Only through a strategic and comprehensive approach can the U.S.
government meet the scope and scale of the biodiversity crisis** and
help lead the world in protecting and beginning to restore nature over
the coming decade. States will continue to lead through policy action,
but a National Biodiversity Strategy will ensure that America reaffirms
and expands its role as a leader in biodiversity
conservation. ]{.underline}

"While states are taking innovative approaches to protect biodiversity,
they recognize the need for more," said Jeff Mauk, NCEL Executive
Director. "States show their true power when they come together and
speak in a strong and unified voice. [With 48 states and territories on
this letter, the need for a National Biodiversity Strategy is
clear."]{.underline}

[**Fifty House Democrats --- with the support of more than 100
environmental groups and academics --- demanded the creation of a
national biodiversity strategy** in a letter to President Biden on
Tuesday.]{.underline}

"The loss of biodiversity presents a direct threat to our security,
health, and well-being," [said the
letter](https://neguse.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20to%20Biden%20Administration%20in%20Final%20Support%20of%20a%20National%20Biodiversity%20Strategy.pdf),
sent by Rep. [Joe
Neguse ](https://thehill.com/people/joe-neguse/)(D-Colo.). "As species
decline and habitats degrade, we lose critical ecosystem services that
provide us with clean water, fertile soils, food, and the very air we
breathe."

[The letter follows up on Neguse's January 2021 proposal, [H.R.
69](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/69),
for a federal biodiversity strategy. While the representatives who
signed Tuesday's letter were all Democrats, the 39 co-sponsors of last
January's resolution also included one Republican, Rep. [Brian
Fitzpatrick ](https://thehill.com/people/brian-fitzpatrick/)(Pa.).]{.underline}

Tuesday's letter commended Biden for his efforts thus far to address
"compounding environmental crises," including his commitment to
conserving 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. But the signers
also warned that as many as a million species worldwide are at risk of
extinction, while in North America alone, almost 3 billion birds have
disappeared since 1970.

As habitats and critical ecosystems degrade, the availability of clean
water, air and food also diminishes, according to the letter. The World
Economic Forum has likewise identified biodiversity loss as one of the
top five threats to the global economy, the signers added.

Not only does the country's loss of biodiversity imperil human health
and cause economic distress, it "also disproportionately impacts
communities of color, low-income communities, tribal communities, and
others that have historically faced environmental injustice," according
to the letter.

[The letter asks that the government address the "five drivers of
biodiversity loss," which H.R. 69 defines as human alteration of
terrestrial and marine environments, exploitation of wildlife,
acceleration of climate change, introduction of invasive species, and
pollution of air, land and water]{.underline}.

The federal biodiversity strategy, according to the letter, should also
"promote social equity and environmental justice" while coordinating the
national response with other such initiatives around the world.

["The United States ought to be playing a global leadership role in
addressing the biodiversity crisis, and with President [Joe
Biden ](https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden/)in office we have the
opportunity to do so," Neguse [said in a
statement](https://neguse.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-neguse-urges-adoption-of-national-biodiversity-strategy-says-action-to-protect-ecosystems-and-wildlife-is-urgent-).]{.underline}
"The decline of biodiversity presents a direct threat to our nation's
well-being, and it's time for the U.S. to take an ambitious
whole-of-government approach to address these issues."

Jamie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of the Defenders of Wildlife
organization, described biodiversity as "the foundation our planet is
built on," emphasizing how humans "depend on nature and the richness of
species within it."

"If the extinction crisis continues unabated, our nation will lose our
unique landscapes, wildlife and biodiversity forever," she said in a
statement. "It is imperative for President Biden to establish a national
biodiversity strategy before it's too late." 

[On the same day that Neguse and his colleagues sent their letter to the
president, Defenders of Wildlife and several other national conservation
groups launched a campaign to advocate for a domestic biodiversity
strategy.]{.underline} Worldwide, 193 other countries have already
developed similar such plans, the cohort [said in a
statement](https://defenders.org/newsroom/environmental-organizations-federal-and-state-leaders-call-national-biodiversity-strategy).

[The **movement to implement a federal government strategy is garnering
increasing support**, **with 120 environmental organizations, scientists
and university** students across the U.S. supporting its creation,
according to the groups.]{.underline}

Addie Haughey, legislative director of Earthjustice, called upon Biden
to "take concrete steps to prevent extinctions" such as bolstering the
Endangered Species Act and investing in the recovery of threatened
species.

"The U.S. must take action to address the biodiversity crisis that

#### Deploy K-Anonymity to allow re-identification.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2528029/?tool=pmcentrez,
Accessed 07-13-2022)

[[The way in which k-anonymity would be applied depends on the
re-identification scenario]{.mark} one is protecting
against.]{.underline} To protect against the prosecutor
re-identification scenario, then k-anonymity should be used. If the
prosecutor scenario is not applicable, then k-anonymity is not
recommended, and k-map should be used instead (or our approximations of
it using the hypothesis testing approach D4). If both scenarios are
plausible, [[then k-anonymity should be used because this is the most
protective]{.mark}. Therefore, being able to make a decision on whether
the prosecutor scenario is applicable is important.]{.underline}

If we assume a threshold risk of 0.2, then under the prosecutor scenario
the data custodian would just k-anonymize with k = 5. Under the
journalist scenario the data custodian would determine An external file
that holds a picture, illustration, etc.

Object name is 627.S1067502708001047.si83.jpg using the hypothesis
testing approach (D4) and then k-anonymize with An external file that
holds a picture, illustration, etc.

Object name is 627.S1067502708001047.si84.jpg.

[An intruder would only pursue a prosecutor re-identification scenario
if s/he has certainty that the VIP has a record in An external file that
holds a picture]{.underline}, illustration, etc.

Object name is 627.S1067502708001047.si85.jpg. [[There are three
ways]{.mark} in which an intruder can [have such
certainty]{.mark}:]{.underline} 79,95

1 [[The]{.mark} disclosed [data set represents the whole
population]{.mark} (e.g., a population registry) or has a large sampling
fraction]{.underline}. If the whole population is being disclosed then
the intruder would have certainty that the VIP is in the disclosed data
set. Also, a large sampling fraction means that the VIP is very likely
to be in the disclosed data set.

2 [If [it can be easily determined who]{.mark} is in the [disclosed
sample]{.mark}. For example, the sample may be a data set from an
interview survey conducted in a company and it is generally known who
participated in these interviews because the participants missed half a
day of work.]{.underline} In such a case it is known within the company,
and to an internal intruder, who is in the disclosed data set.

[3 [The individuals in the disclosed data set self-reveal that they are
part of the sample]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, subjects in
clinical trials do generally inform their family, friends, and even
acquaintances that they are participating in a trial. One of the
acquaintances may attempt to re-identify one of these self-revealing
subjects. However, it is not always the case that individuals do know
that their data is in a data set. For example, for studies were consent
has been waived or where patients provide broad authorization for their
data or tissue samples to be used in research, the patients may not know
that their data is in a specific data set, providing no opportunity for
self-revealing their inclusion.

If any of the above conditions apply[, then protecting against the
prosecutor scenario is required.]{.underline} However, [many
epidemiologic and health services research studies, including secondary
use studies, would not meet the criteria set out above. In such a case,
protection against the journalist scenario with the D4 approach is
recommended.]{.underline}

Relationship to Other Work

[[Re-identification risk is sometimes measured or estimated as the
proportion of records that are unique in the population]{.mark}. Such
uniqueness is then used as a proxy for re-identification
risk.]{.underline} One approach for estimating population uniqueness
from a sample uses the Poisson--gamma model with the α and β parameters
estimated by the method of moments, 96,97 but it over-estimates with
small sampling fractions and under-estimates as the sampling fraction
increases. 98 Another method that uses sub-sampling performs well for
larger sampling fractions. 99--101 More recent work developed
probability models and estimators for two attack-based re-identification
risk measures. 102 However, uniqueness measures of risk will by
definition give an answer of zero for any k-anonymized data set, and
therefore are inappropriate in this context.

[[There is increasing pressure to disclose health research data,]{.mark}
and this is especially true when the data has been collected using
public funds. However, the disclosure of such data raises serious
privacy concerns.]{.underline} For example, consider an individual who
participated in a clinical trial having all of their clinical and lab
data published in a journal web site accompanying the article on the
trial. [[If it was possible to re-identify]{.mark} the records of that
individual from this [public data it would be a breach of
privacy.]{.mark}]{.underline} Such an incident could result in fewer
people participating in research studies because of privacy concerns,
and if it happened in Canada, would be breaking privacy laws.

It is therefore important to understand precisely the types of
re-identification attacks that can be launched on a data set and the
different ways to properly anonymize the data before it is disclosed.

[Anonymization techniques result in distortions to the data. Excessive
anonymization may reduce the quality of the data making it unsuitable
for some analysis, and possibly result in incorrect or biased
results.]{.underline} Therefore, it is important to balance the amount
of anonymization being performed against the amount of information loss.

In this paper we focused on k-anonymity, which is a popular approach for
protecting privacy. We considered the two re-identification scenarios
that k-anonymity is intended to protect against. For one of the
scenarios, [[we showed that actual re-identification risk under the
baseline k-anonymity is much lower]{.mark} than the threshold risk that
the data custodian assumes, and that this results in an excessive amount
of information loss]{.underline}, especially at small sampling
fractions. [We then evaluated three alternative approaches and found
that one of them consistently ensures that the re-identification risk is
quite close to the actual risk, and always has lower information loss
than the baseline approach.]{.underline}

[[It is recommended that data custodians determine which
re-identification scenarios apply on a case-by-case basis]{.mark}, and
anonymize the data before disclosure using the baseline k-anonymity
model or our modified k-anonymity model accordingly]{.underline}.

A secure communication pathway in association with health departments
and public health officials to outbreaks of bioterrorist events may be
created between emergency services and governmental public health
departments. [[Communication between medical health providers]{.mark},
emergency room personnel, infection-control personnel, [and
infectious-disease personnel in hospitals might be]{.mark} constituted
and [maintained through a health advisory network]{.mark}.]{.underline}
In addition, at regular intervals, meetings may be performed in order to
share information regarding planning responses in collaboration against
bioterrorist attacks. [Local health authorities, including emergency
services, should examine their preparedness repeatedly for a potential
bioterrorist attack and routinely review coordination issues with
agencies that take place in response.]{.underline} [[Programs aimed to
coordinate and direct emergency preparedness and response including
antibioterrorism efforts should be created]{.mark} \[18\]. [Training
programs for health providers are also useful for preparedness and
alertness]{.mark}.]{.underline} It was shown that when gaming
simulations were used to test knowledge and skill of individuals who
engage in antibioterrorism, better outcomes were obtained with trained
personnel \[19\]. Association of better scores with training underline
the importance of training programs when a real event is faced. However,
in a survey study with 1028 participants in Canada, it was reported that
most of the emergency service providers have not been trained enough to
identify and work in contaminated environments under chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear attacks \[20\]. The situation must
be considered worse in developing countries, and programs focusing on
health providers, especially those in emergency services, must be
initiated as quickly as possible. Public health providers can be trained
either by online education programs or face to face \[21\]. Surveillance
systems can also be developed to provide important new capabilities in
responding to public health emergencies. However, these efforts may
result in false alarms and related increased cost \[22\].

Measures to enhance diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities and
capacities alongside training and education are thought to improve the
ability of society to combat \'regular\' infectious diseases outbreaks,
as well as mitigating the effects of bioterrorist attacks \[23\].

When a public health emergency is identified, it may be wise to redirect
resources, e.g., funding, staff, and space from core public health
programs to contribute to the public health emergency response \[24\].

There are also studies in the literature suggesting step by step
measures to address bioterrorist events. [Current trends in biosecurity
and cybersecurity include (1) the wide availability of technology and
specialized knowledge that previously were available only to
governments; (2) the global economic recession, which may increase the
spread of radical non-state actors; and (3) recent US and EU commission
reports that reflect concerns about non-state actors in asymmetric
threats. [The nature of bioterrorism threats requires collaboration
across several sectors including intelligence, police, forensics,
customs, and other law enforcement organizations who must work
together]{.mark} with public and animal health organizations as well as
environmental and social science organizations]{.underline}.
Coordination in decision-making among these organizations is required,
based on knowledge and information sharing. An "information sharing
risk-benefit analysis" may be constituted to determine the risk of not
sharing information among organizations compared to the benefit of
sharing information in order to prevent a terrorist attack and to
enhance a rapid response capability in case it occurs. [In work package
3 of the EU project AniBioThreat, early warning is the main topic. A
strategy has been generated based on an iterative approach to bring law
enforcement agencies and human and animal health institutes together.
Workshops and exercises were involved during the first half of the
project, and spin-off activities [include new preparedness plans for
institutes and the formation of a legal adviser network for decision
making]{.mark}.]{.underline} Additionally, in Stockholm, Sweden, in
2012, a seminar on actionable knowledge was held, which identified the
need to bring various agency cultures together to work on developing a
resilient capability to identify early signs of bio- and agroterrorism
threats. The seminar concluded that there are a number of challenges in
building a collaborative culture, including developing an education
program that supports collaboration and shared situational awareness
\[25\].

[[Policy makers must also focus on vaccine production]{.mark} since
vaccines are the best protection against infectious diseases. There is
an ongoing academic debate on use of vaccines in biological warfare.
Uncertainty of the threats is the major challenging issue in vaccine
development. Even though vaccines against smallpox, anthrax, and Ebola
viruses seem to have priority, an extensive policy on vaccines covering
both military personnel and civilians is needed \[6\].]{.underline}

[[Reports reveal that we are not well-prepared to deal with a terrorist
attack that employs biological weapons]{.underline}.]{.mark} As was done
in response to the nuclear threat, the medical community should educate
the public and policy makers about the threat. [[In the longer term, we
need to be prepared to detect, diagnose, characterize epidemiologically,
and respond appropriately to biological weapons]{.mark} use and the
threat of new and reemerging infections. On the immediate horizon, [we
cannot delay the development and implementation of strategic plans for
coping with civilian bioterrorism.]{.mark}]{.underline} \[26\]. As a
result, education and training of the healthcare providers, especially
emergency physicians, are the mainstay of the battle against
bioterrorism. Emergency departments must be constructed in a way
suitable for a possible chaos and overcrowding that may occur when a
real event happens. [[Awareness and preparedness to biological warfare
agents must be accepted as a part of national biodefense
policy]{.mark}.]{.underline}

## China CP

### 1NC\-\--China CP\-\--Hotlines

#### \-\--establish a nuclear de-escalation crisis communication hotline between US and Chinese officials

#### Hotlines [solve]{.underline} China

Robert **Pape 14**, Professor of Political Science and Director of the
Chicago Project on Security and Terrorism at the University of Chicago,
4/29/14, Washington Post, "A hotline to cool Asian crises,"
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/04/29/a-hotline-to-cool-asian-crises/shppp>)

The ["Red Telephone" connecting world leaders]{.underline} is the
[**modern epitome** of crisis management]{.underline}. Yet, it might
surprise most Americans to learn that, despite the increasing power of
China and the potential for conflict and misunderstanding, [**no such
working connection exists** between the U.S. and China.]{.underline} In
the past five years, the [East Asian region has been embroiled in a
series of minor territorial disputes]{.underline} as China has asserted
its regional dominance over its neighbors; some of these have directly
involved China and the United States. There is [**no easier step to
defuse potential conflict** between these two great powers than to
establish a hotline]{.underline} -- to be known as CHILINK -- [between
them.]{.underline}

The [proposed hotline would be similar to]{.underline} the one between
the United States and Russia ([MOLINK]{.underline}) during the Cold War.
Though popularized in "Dr. Strangelove," MOLINK was not a telephone, but
simply a plain text teletype transmission system. MOLINK was [activated
on Aug. 30, 1963, in response to the frantic and inefficient
communication between the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and the Soviet Union during the Cuban Missile
Crisis]{.underline}. MOLINK has **[multiple terminals in key government
buildings]{.underline}**, only some of which are able to transmit a
response. During the Cold War, the transmission traveled along multiple
pathways to ensure reliable delivery; in 2008, the hotline was upgraded
to a new fiber optic-enabled system, enabling both audio and e-mail
messages.

The [hotline worked effectively in situations in which neither the U.S.
nor the Soviet Union was involved]{.underline}, [but they both wanted to
communicate their intentions]{.underline}, preventing potential
superpower involvement, and unnecessary escalation. The hotline was used
during the Six Day War in 1967, the Indo-Pakistani War in 1971, the Yom
Kippur War in 1973, and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. [Given
the increasing number and intensity of East Asian territorial disputes,
a hotline is **more necessary now than ever before.**]{.underline}

China and the U.S. have tried and failed to establish a working hotline
in the past. In 1989, after the Tiananmen Square protests, President
Bush attempted to contact Deng Xiaoping via phone; because no hotline
was in place, the president's call went unanswered. Although Presidents
Clinton and Jiang agreed to establish a presidential hotline in 1997,
when the United States accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade two years later, the call was not answered. In February 2008
the United States and China signed a formal agreement to establish a new
hotline, called the Defense Phone Link, but the agreement was negotiated
well below the presidential level. It has only been used four times.

The inability to establish a hotline is surprising because China has
working hotlines with several other governments. There are currently
functioning hotlines between China and Russia, South Korea, India and
Vietnam.

[Previous hotlines have failed for **two primary reasons**]{.underline}.
[First]{.underline}, the [**internal Chinese disconnect** between the
military and civilian personnel makes crisis management very
difficult]{.underline}. [Second]{.underline}, [the]{.underline}
[C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunist [P]{.underline}arty rules
[dictate]{.underline} that the [Standing Committee must vote prior to
conveying information]{.underline} to the Americans. This policy makes
rapid communication between U.S. and Chinese presidents in times of
crisis very difficult. The [new Chinese National Security
Council]{.underline}, established in November 2013, [attempts to
**remedy these internal disconnects** in authority]{.underline}. The
creation of this new parallel body invites an unprecedented opportunity
for a hotline connecting the U.S. National Security Council with its
Chinese counterpart.

#### Solves [escalation]{.underline} from cyberattacks.

Kylie **Atwood 21,** national security correspondent and graduated cum
laude from Middlebury College with a major in international studies and
a minor in economics, Biden administration looks to set up \'red phone\'
to China for emergency communications, CNN, 7-14-2021,
https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/14/politics/biden-red-phone-china-xi/index.html/shppp

A [hotline to Beijing would let]{.underline} President [Joe
Biden]{.underline}, or top officials on his national security team,
[immediately **send encrypted** phone calls]{.underline} or messages
[to]{.underline} President [Xi Jinping or those around him]{.underline},
according to the two sources. For example, [urgent information could be
shared about **sudden military movements** or **warning messages** sent
about **cyber hacks.**]{.underline}

The [idea of setting up a hotline with Beijing dates back to at least
the Obama administration]{.underline}, though the [concept wasn\'t
codified]{.underline} into a classified national security memo until the
final year of the Trump administration, according to a source familiar
with the memo.

Biden administration officials have continued to pursue the idea,
sources said, but there remain numerous details to work out, including
whether the Chinese would even agree to use the device. There have long
been issues with securing rapid responses from Beijing when it comes to
urgent matters, current and former US officials told CNN. The top-down
nature of the Chinese political system means that most contact beyond
leader-level engagement is disincentivized.

A similar hotline to China already exists at the Pentagon and is
supposed to be used exclusively for military matters but rarely is.

\"We do have a hotline. It\'s known to have, the couple of times we\'ve
used it, just rung in an empty room for hours upon hours,\" said Kurt
Campbell, the senior National Security Council Indo-Pacific coordinator,
earlier this year during a conversation about US-China diplomacy and
Taiwan.

The [issues with the current system]{.underline} [coupled with China\'s
increasingly offensive military have led to mounting concerns among US
national security officials]{.underline} about the potential of
miscalculation with China, [and a feeling that **more needs to be done**
to increase communication.]{.underline}

\"There is a worrisome shortage of tools for incident management in the
US-China relationship. It is pretty urgent that the US government
pursues working lines of communication which allow them to respond to a
crisis or to prevent a crisis. We need a 911 operator so to speak,\"
said Danny Russel, a former assistant secretary at the State Department.
Russel added that it is imperative to also consider tools \"that can be
integrated into a wider crisis communication strategy, with the focus on
broad risk reduction.\"

A senior administration official declined to discuss the device when
asked about it but did say that \"generally speaking, of course we have
an interest in ensuring that competition with China is managed in a
responsible way. We have been clear this relationship will be defined by
competition and we welcome that stiff competition, but we will also
continue to work to ensure this competition doesn\'t veer into
conflict.\"

Working out the technical details

Officials at the State Department and the National Security Council are
still working on how the device would technically work, sources told
CNN. The [next step would be developing the overall concept and working
it into the Biden administration\'s plan for engagement with
China]{.underline}. Then the device would need approval from the White
House and from Chinese officials before being implemented.

While the \"red phone\" between the US and Russia was viewed as a useful
tool that increased communication during the Cold War, its recent
effectiveness is questionable. For example, the Obama administration
used the hotline to the Kremlin to warn Russia not to interfere in the
2016 US elections, a warning that was not heeded.

The efficacy of a new hotline with China would be highly dependent on
Beijing\'s commitment to using it and placing it in a position where Xi
would have regular access to it.

\"[There would be advantages to setting up this kind of tool for
**high-level messaging with China on strategic cyber
concerns**]{.underline}, but you have to make sure it is connected to
the right place in the chain to connect with leadership effortlessly and
quickly,\" said Chris Painter, former State Department coordinator for
cyber issues under President Barack Obama. \"You may not get information
back that you want, but it could be used to send messages back and forth
to put people on notice.\"

Trouble with timely responses from China

In recent years the US and other countries have been unable to secure
timely responses from China on pressing issues. For example, in the last
year it has been challenging to get answers from China surrounding
Covid-19, US officials said.

\"There are challenges when it comes to reaching Chinese officials
during times of difficulty. That is largely because the way their system
works is top down. During the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak, we
often did not get any response to critical questions,\" said a former US
official who served in Beijing.

In 2014, China\'s state-owned oil company dispatched an oil rig to a
contested area of the South China Sea and they would not respond to
calls from Vietnam to discuss the matter.

The idea of connecting the White House and Beijing has been loosely
discussed for years, but implementation had always seemed far off.

\"We discussed [the idea of a cyber messaging system with Chinese
officials during the Obama administration. It was brought up in the
context of our cyber discussions]{.underline}, but we did not make much
progress. It was not clear where it was going to be placed in China, and
[China did not have the same history of confidence-building measures
with the US]{.underline} that Russia did, so they viewed it in a more
suspicious way,\" said Painter. \"[But I think **now they understand
more** about how it could be used.]{.underline} It is not a silver
bullet, by any means, [but it does give you a useful
tool.\"]{.underline}

## Econ CP

### 1NC\-\--Econ CP

#### The United States federal government should: 

#### -improve workforce skills in the economy as per Baily

#### -increase funding for education in the US

#### -create an easily-accessible program for small business startups

#### The CP solves growth\-\--creates a more productive and skilled workforce

**Baily 20,** Martin Neil, 12-16-2020, Ph.D. in economics in 1972 at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Senior Fellow Emeritus in
Economic Studies at Brookings. \"How to boost long-run growth after
COVID-19,\" Brookings,
[https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-boost-long-run-growth-after-covid-19/](https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-boost-long-run-growth-after-covid-19/%20)
//BigSasher

Members of the workforce who have not completed a college degree and
receive very little on-the-job training are shortchanged by our current
educational system. These workers have seen their earnings stagnate, and
they are undercutting their lifetime incomes by leaving the workforce
early.\[11\] [To improve the]{.underline} post-pandemic [labor
market]{.underline} and to help companies be more productive,
[policymakers should invest in a]{.underline}n expanded [skills training
program]{.underline}. This is not a short-term policy, it is a long-run
project. [**Achieving stronger productivity and** more inclusive
**growth depends on** creating **a more skilled
workforce.**]{.underline}

In designing a training program it is vital to avoid the problems that
have plagued such efforts in the past. Anthony Carnevale, a training
expert now at Georgetown, has laid out the key problems. [Many previous
programs were designed to train workers for manufacturing jobs even
though the availability]{.underline} of manufacturing jobs [is
limited]{.underline}. [Most past programs were run in collaboration with
unions and employers have adversarial relationships with
them]{.underline}. [Some]{.underline} past programs [have been costly to
employers]{.underline} and workers they have trained quit for a better
jobs elsewhere. Some parents are opposed to training programs, seeing
them as pushing their children into second-class careers.\[12
\]Carnevale notes the federal training budget is only \$8 billion, so we
are not really trying to train the workforce. **[This
proposal]{.underline}** by Brookings expert Annelies Goger includes
elements I just described. It [**recommends** scaling up **"earn and
learn" programs** in states and regions, in which employer and community
college partnerships provide workers a compensation as they receive
on-the-job training.]{.underline}

There are also lessons to be drawn from successful training programs.
Harry Holzer, also of Georgetown and a Brookings nonresident senior
fellow, has written extensively on training programs, finding that those
with the right design have worked well. [Programs do better when they
provide training through community colleges that is linked to the needs
of local employers.]{.underline} An assessment by Mathematica of
registered apprenticeship programs in 10 states concluded that program
participants had substantially higher earnings than nonparticipants.
[Other countries' successes with training programs are also worth
considering. Germany]{.underline} has a very extensive apprenticeship
program that trains young people not just for manufacturing jobs but
also for service sector jobs. [Denmark]{.underline} has a program called
Flexicurity which provides retraining for workers who have lost their
jobs. [If a company lays off workers, those workers are given generous
financial support, but this is linked to their participation in a
training program]{.underline}. [If workers fail to participate in
training or if they turn down a suitable job, they lose the financial
support]{.underline}.\[13\]

The [potential for improvement is great.]{.underline} A recent study by
Peter Q. Blair and colleagues found that as many as [30 million workers
that do not have Bachelor's degrees have the potential to obtain better
jobs and earn more than they are paid the positions they currently hold.
They have intrinsic skills that are not being using in their current
jobs.]{.underline}

[In designing a new program]{.underline}, I propose that [states and
cities have]{.underline} the [flexibility to organize their efforts in
accordance with local labor market conditions.]{.underline} [Programs
should be run in collaboration with employers that can specify the
skills they need, provide instructors, and promise jobs to those that
pass qualifying exams. In return, the employers get trained workers at
low cost]{.underline}. Community colleges provide a natural setting for
this training to take place, but instructors must have the necessary
experience and skills to provide hands-on training. It is futile to
train more people for manufacturing jobs than there are jobs available,
but as the older generation retires there will be job openings in this
sector. Further, there are many blue-collar jobs in the service sector
that pay well and remain in demand, such as auto mechanics, heating and
air conditioning servicers, and plumbers. [Participants in training
should be paid a stipend, conditional on attendance and receive a bonus
for passing the program, which may help overcome resistance to
vocational education.]{.underline}

Experimentation by local governments should be encouraged as long as
data is made available to allow independent post-program evaluation of
successes and failures. [The fed]{.underline}eral
[gov]{.underline}ernment [should underwrite the cost of the programs,
recognizing that a percentage of the funds will be wasted but that **a
more skilled workforce benefits the whole economy**.]{.underline} There
should be extensive marketing and messaging around the training programs
and investments in outreach. [Providing a stipend plus a good outreach
program will help overcome the resistance of younger people to a
non-academic program and the resistance of older workers to
re-training.]{.underline} Funds should be included to set up an easy
interface to inform people about the programs and to help people enroll
online. As part of the training, people should be coached on how to
apply for jobs. Technology can help in the learning process as long as
there are good teachers and mentors available.

### 2NC\-\--Econ CP\-\--Solvency\-\--Education

#### Investment in Education spurs economic growth

**Boser 20,** Ulrich, 8-26-2020, a senior fellow at American Progress
and the CEO and founder of the Learning Agency and the Learning Agency
Lab, which are devoted to scaling the science of learning. \"Better
Learning Outcomes Can Help Kick-Start the Economy,\" Center for American
Progress,
<https://www.americanprogress.org/article/better-learning-outcomes-can-help-kick-start-economy/>
//BigSasher

This new study builds on a large body of research: [**Economists** have
clearly **shown that investing in education leads to** major **economic
returns in** terms of both **salaries** and]{.underline} gross domestic
product (**[GDP]{.underline}**). [It also contributes to an overall more
successful economy and thriving labor market, as employment tends to
closely track increasing educational outcomes]{.underline}. Indeed, one
of the best predictors of economic growth is educational outcomes, and
furthering education would provide a much-needed boost to the American
economy---and American workers.

To better understand the exact connection between learning and economic
growth, the study examined the economic benefits of additional learning.
The inspiration behind the analysis came from a National Bureau of
Economic Research (NBER) study, called "Returns to Skills around the
World: Evidence from PIAAC," that showed how [workers could experience
economic benefits from gaining more domain expertise---including math
knowledge and cognitive skills such as critical thinking.]{.underline}
The new analysis took the percentage calculations from this NBER study
and turned them into a precise estimate of income growth per year. As
part of the analysis, it considered all full-time workers in the United
States and assumed a standard deviation increase in scores, which was
equal to a 200-point jump in SAT scores.

The results showed that **[better math skills would increase salaries by
a whopping \$21,000 each year.]{.underline}** The study looked only at
U.S workers aged 35 to 54 who work full-time jobs that require some math
skills. Still, the earnings increases were very large: [Over two
decades, an individual could earn up to \$400,000 more by having more
math skills. In some states, increases were even higher]{.underline}.
For example, in California, better math outcomes would lead to a
\$25,000 annual increase in wages; in Washington, D.C., this figure
jumped to \$31,000; and in New York, over a 20 year period, the increase
in income would come close to \$500,000.

[The study yielded similar results in writing and reading]{.underline},
finding that improved writing outcomes can increase salaries by as much
as \$11,000 per year. [In fact, just having a high school diploma can
deliver impressive economic results]{.underline}, garnering nearly
\$7,000 more in salaries each year for individuals.

In short, [workers with more skills gain more money. This is in large
part due to the fact that school gives young people the essential skills
they need in life, such as how to write clearly and study
effectively]{.underline}. However, [these skills not only help students
learn, they also provide them with more career and work opportunities.
What's more, individuals with such skills are more effective in their
jobs, as they are better equipped to manage a range of situations in
their work environment]{.underline}. In addition, with improved
reasoning skills, employees are far more efficient and productive.

To put it differently, [higher-skilled workers serve as an economic
driver. They help boost GDP and improve the overall
economy]{.underline}. Practically speaking, individuals should make sure
to gain skills by setting aside time to learn and land degrees. But more
broadly, education requires investment. Especially given the pandemic,
policy leaders must invest---not cut---school funding. In particular,
they should invest in what works, from online tutoring to proven math
programs.

The new study does have a number of limitations. It doesn't account for
differences in schools' needs, such as students with individualized
education programs. What's more, improving educational outcomes is hard,
especially given COVID-19; and even before the pandemic, student
outcomes had been lagging, according to the National Assessment of
Educational Progress.

Still, **[education is the way out of the nation's current economic
downturn]{.underline}.** Therefore, it is [vital for policymakers to
support improving educational outcomes. Even in this time of economic
uncertainty, leaders must invest in a better education system---one that
will reinvent our economy and drive the growth that the country so
clearly needs.]{.underline}

#### Small businesses are key\-\--boosting startup propels their impact on the economy

**Office Of Advocacy 19**, 1-30-2019, Created by Congress in 1976, the

independent voice for small business within the federal government.

//BigSasher

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- **[Small businesses are the lifeblood of the U.S.
economy]{.underline}**: [they create two-thirds of net new jobs and
drive U.S. innovation and competitiveness]{.underline}. A new [report
shows that **they account for 44 percent of U.S. economic
activity**.]{.underline} This is a significant contribution, however
this overall share has declined gradually.

U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of the goods and
services produced by labor and property located in the United States.
Across the 16 years from 1998 to 2014, the [small business share of GDP
has fallen from 48.0 percent to 43.5 percent. Over the same period, the
amount of small business GDP has grown by about 25 percent in real
terms, or 1.4 percent annually. However, real GDP for large businesses
has grown faster, at 2.5 percent annually.]{.underline}

"[This useful benchmark shows us that small businesses continue to be
big contributors to the U.S. economy]{.underline}," Acting Chief Counsel
for Advocacy Major L. Clark said. "While their contribution has grown at
a slower rate than that of large businesses, small businesses continue
to be at the forefront of driving innovation, jobs and economic growth."

Nominal small business GDP measured \$5.9 trillion in 2014, the most
recent year for which small business GDP data are available. The [three
largest small business sectors]{.underline} contributing to it were (1)
the [real estate and rental and leasing]{.underline} industry; (2)
[wholesale and retail trade]{.underline}; and (3) the [manufacturing and
mining]{.underline} sector.

The 2008 recession played a small part in the lower small business
share, but structural changes may have played a part as well. These
factors include long run declines in business dynamism, the rise of
big-box stores, the changing regulatory environment and the critical
role of credit availability.

//BigSasher

The national [importance of education]{.underline} is [based on the
significant positive influence it has on]{.underline}

[individual lives and on the welfare of communities. Education is
primarily a way to train children in the]{.underline}

[skills they will need as adults to find good jobs and live
well]{.underline} \[9\]. But education also has broader social

and economic benefits for individuals, families, and society at large
\[9\]. These benefits are received

even by people whose relationship to the public school system does not
extend beyond "taxpayer." [The]{.underline}

[widespread improvement of social and economic conditions is a direct
outcome of an educated]{.underline}

[population that is better able to use information to make good
decisions and which is collectively better]{.underline}

[trained for work.]{.underline}

A great deal of recent research demonstrates how the [**benefits** of
supporting public education]{.underline}

[**extend** far **beyond** each child's individual **academic
gains**.]{.underline} [A **population** that is **better educated**
**has less**]{.underline}

[**unemployment**, **reduced dependence on public assistance** programs,
and **greater tax revenue**.]{.underline}

[Education also plays a key role in the reduction of **crime, improved
public health, and greater political**]{.underline}

[**and civic engagement**. Investment in public education results in
billions of dollars of social and]{.underline}

[economic benefits for society at large.]{.underline}

In Pennsylvania, [local communities invest significantly different
amounts in their public]{.underline}

## Food Scarcity CP

### 1NC\-\--Food Insecurity CP

#### Plan Text: The United States Federal Government should: 

#### Provide children meals when schools are closed, and

#### Help hungry college kids when campuses are closed, and

#### Serve older adults food who are struggling due to COVID 19, and 

#### Allocate funds to homemade meals.

#### The counterplan solves. 

**Morris and Larin 21** --- Steve Morris, Kathy Larin, 2021 ("Addressing
Food Insecurity in America, Before and During the Pandemic," *GAO*,
October 12^th^, Available Online at

Accessed 7-23-2022)

[[Providing children meals, even when schools are
closed]{.underline}]{.mark}

In the U.S., food assistance for children in need is often provided
through K-12 public schools, for example through free or reduced-priced
meals and snacks.

[Programs like National School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast
Program, and Summer Food Service Program received \$23.1 billion in
federal funding in FY 2019. The National School Lunch Program, which is
the largest program, supported almost 30 million students in 2019, with
more than 94,000 schools participating.]{.underline}

But, what happened when schools were closed during the pandemic?

When school closures began in the spring of 2020, USDA's Food Nutrition
Service (FNS), which runs the programs mentioned above, granted various
nationwide waivers to facilitate the continuation of meal services.
Waivers enabled parents and guardians to pick up meals, and provided
flexibilities in foods served and meal times.

[Despite these waivers, in March 2021, we reported that school meal
programs served nearly 1.7 billion fewer meals from March through
September 2020---a decline of more than 30% compared with the same
months the previous year.]{.underline}

School district officials we interviewed pointed to several reasons for
the drop in number of meals served, including fears by families of
exposure to COVID-19, which kept some from venturing out to pick up
meals. Officials also said that families may not have participated in
school meal programs because they qualified for other assistance
programs---such as Emergency Meals-to-You or Pandemic Electronic Benefit
Transfer (Pandemic EBT).

[[Helping hungry college students even when campuses are
closed]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Many college students may not have enough to eat. The federal
government spends billions each year on grants, loans, and work-study
funding to help make attending college more affordable for students.
Yet, many still cannot afford basic necessities such as
food.]{.underline}

In 2019, we tried to measure how many college students faced food
insecurity, and identified some programs that were available to them at
their schools. We reviewed 31 studies with a wide range of reported
rates of food insecurity, but could not determine a reliable national
estimate for college students. We also looked at how 14 colleges
addressed food insecurity among their students. All 14 colleges provided
free food to students through on-campus pantries, and most colleges
offered emergency funds to help students pay for living expenses.

[Many of the colleges we looked at screened students for potential
eligibility for federal programs like the Supplemental Nutritional
Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as food stamps). However, we
found that less than half of the 3.3 million students who were
potentially eligible for SNAP in 2016 reported receiving it at
school.]{.underline}

We found that the lack of clarity on SNAP's eligibility rules for
college students may be limiting its use. And in 2019, we recommended
that FNS, which runs SNAP, increase awareness of SNAP, including
providing clear information about who is eligible and increasing
outreach. FNS generally agreed with our recommendations and has
implemented 1 of them.

Whether or not they were eligible for or receiving SNAP, many students
faced unexpected expenses as a result of the pandemic---including
housing, food, and technology purchases---after schools closed their
physical campuses. To help students and schools, Congress created the
Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund in March 2020, as part of the
CARES Act. In our August blog post, we explored how this funding was
used---who got what and how much.

[[Serving older adults who may have faced additional challenges because
of COVID-19]{.underline}]{.mark}

[For America's seniors, lack of mobility can impact their access to
food. In 2019, we looked at meal delivery and other services for older
Americans living in rural communities. These seniors are particularly
vulnerable to isolation and food security issues because they may have
less access to services, longer travel distances to grocery stories, and
fewer transportation options.]{.underline}

Some community organizations and service providers have developed
strategies for serving older adults in their communities. These
included:

[[delivering frozen or shelf-stable meals to older adults, once every
1-2 weeks;]{.underline}]{.mark}

[identifying neighbors to help pick up and drop off frozen meals, or
using a service that ships refrigerated meals via FedEx when delivery is
not an option;]{.underline}

[providing older adults with extra frozen or shelf-stable meals or
packages of non-perishable food in the event of emergency situations;
and]{.underline}

[[transferring funds designated for congregate meals (those served in a
group setting) to provide more home-delivered
meals.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[We have ongoing work on how COVID-19 has affected services for older
adults, including meals, in-home care, transportation, and health and
wellness activities.]{.underline}

Selected Colleges\' Initiatives o Address Student Food Insecurity

[**[Food prices are increasing rapidly]{.mark}**, with grocery price
inflation levels above 5% in April.7 Food insecurity is intrinsically
linked to adverse health outcomes, especially among
children]{.underline}, with increased risks of chronic disease and
mental illness later in life.8 [[The first step must be to identify the
scale of the problem]{.mark}, and indeed, some posit that [doctors have
an ethical obligation to ask about food
insecurity]{.mark}.9]{.underline}

The Hunger Vital Signscreen10 identifies households at being at risk for
food insecurity if they answer that either or both of the following two
statements is often true or never true: '[Within the past 12 months we
worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy
more''Within the past 12 months the food we bought just didn't last and
we didn't have money to get more']{.underline} 11

[[You could make it simpler than this to screen for poverty]{.mark} ---
and just ask, 'Do you (ever) have difficulty making ends meet at the end
of the month?' 12 Being armoured with this information, however, is only
half the battle.]{.underline} As Knight and Fritz write, '[doctors may
feel impotent to deal with food insecurity, even if they are empowered
to unearth it]{.underline}.' 9 As with fuel poverty, acting upon food
insecurity requires local solutions such as knowledge of food banks,
which can be challenging. Directing patients to Citizens Advice13 is a
good first step, as advisers can signpost and refer to food banks as
required.

## Grid CP

### 1NC\-\--Grid CP\-\--Open Source

#### The United States federal government should:

#### Open source the grid

#### The US can protect its grid now

**Vaughan-Nichols 20** \[Steven, Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols is a
freelance writer and technology analyst. Besides ZDNet, he works with
Foundry (Formerly IDG Communications), The Register, The New Stack, and
Cathey Communications., The best way to protect the US electrical grid
is with open source, 5/8/2020,
<https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-way-to-protect-the-us-electrical-grid-is-with-open-source/>\]

[In specific, China is leading the way in advanced electrical grid
technology.]{.underline} [State Grid Corporation of China
(SGCC)](http://www.sgcc.com.cn/ywlm/index.shtml), the world\'s largest
power company, is building the [first ultra-high-voltage DC (UHVDC)
electrical
lines](https://www.power-technology.com/features/chinas-mega-transmission-lines/),
which can carry over a million volts. China is doing this in partnership
with the Swiss-Swedish [ABB Group](https://new.abb.com/). Are
Switzerland and Sweden \"foreign adversaries\" too?

We don\'t know. While Trump declared this to be a national emergency,
it\'s up to the Energy Secretary and other cabinet-level officials to
decide what electric equipment that may fall under the ban. The
global [power companies are struggling to work out what Trump\'s
executive order really
means](https://www.powermag.com/trump-ban-on-foreign-bulk-power-equipment-triggers-new-uncertainty/). 

It\'s a real problem because, as Shuli Goodman, the [LF
Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) executive director, pointed out in an
interview: \"The US has lost almost all capacity to build large
high-voltage equipment, like transformers. [Our power grid is very
dependent upon imports]{.underline}.\" [LF Energy is an open-source
electricity and power systems initiative. Its job is to build and
maintain open-source commodity software for all electrical
companies. ]{.underline}

[But, while we can\'t magically turn the US back into a manufacturing
powerhouse, there is a way to make foreign electrical equipment safer.
You see, Goodman, observed, \"It is not entirely a hardware problem. We
need to be looking at the attack surface and where the risk lies. It is
the firmware embedded in those systems that is the
problem.\" ]{.underline}

[Even when the equipment is assembled in the US, Jeff Pack, a senior
product engineer and cybersecurity expert with [POWER
Engineers](https://www.powereng.com/), observed: \"[Each component will
have
something](https://www.tdworld.com/smart-utility/grid-security/article/21130590/executive-order-to-secure-power-system-met-with-favor-and-uncertainty),
whether it be memory chips, boards, or processing chips, that are
manufactured in foreign lands.\"]{.underline}

With today\'s global supply chain based manufacturing[, it\'s hard to
\"buy American]{.underline}.\" Therefore, Goodman thinks [we should look
to open-sourcing the equipment\'s firmware and software:]{.underline}

[This is also a long-term solution since, as Goodman observed, \"Whether
the hardware is made in those countries that we today deem adversaries
is irrelevant. Big equipment investments are made with 50-year windows
\-- today\'s friends can be tomorrow\'s foes.]{.underline} A malevolent
actor can access and attack the black boxes of all OEMs \-- regardless
of whether they are a nation-state or a major energy company[. We want
to future-proof the grid. The only way to do that is through open
source, in an open community, with open governance, and complete
transparency.\"]{.underline}

Some believe that we could [protect our power grid by mandating the use
of \"retro\"\-- that is analog or
manual](https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-wants-to-isolate-power-grids-with-retro-technology-to-limit-cyber-attacks/)\--
technologies on US power grids. While the [Securing Energy
Infrastructure Act
(SEIA)](https://www.king.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/01-17-19%20Securing%20Energy%20Infrastructure.pdf) has
ordered a trial of this method, this back-to-the-past approach is
unlikely to prove any kind of long-term answer. 

Goodman concluded: \"Given the heightened tensions between the US,
Russia, and China, limiting any black-box technology from any vendor
makes more sense. [If a malevolent actor wants to exploit
vulnerabilities, all black boxes threaten the grid, no matter the
voltage level.\"]{.underline}

[Since US companies aren\'t going to be building new high-end electrical
grid equipment anytime soon, going **open-source is really the only way
forward**. For true security, you need to know exactly what\'s running
inside your equipment and that means open-source software.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Grid CP\-\--Solvency\-\--Open Source

#### Open source will protect the grid

**T and D World 19**\[utility professionals with critical information
related to the planning, design, construction, operations, maintenance
and safety of transmission and distribution facilities, including
automation and information technology, "Open-Source Cybersecurity Tool
to Enhance Grid Protection", 6/20/2019,
<https://www.tdworld.com/smart-utility/grid-security/article/20972732/opensource-cybersecurity-tool-to-enhance-grid-protection>\]

[A revolutionary new cybersecurity tool that can help **protect the
electric power grid** has been released to the public on the
code-hosting website GitHub]{.underline}. Developed by researchers at
the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Idaho National Laboratory (INL),
the Structured Threat Intelligence Graph (STIG) software [allows utility
owners and operators to easily visualize, share, create, and edit
cyberthreat intelligence information.]{.underline}

[The ability to share threat intelligence is essential for protecting
critical infrastructure like the electric power grid, water treatment
facilities, oil refineries, and manufacturing plants from cyber
exploits. Prior to the development of this software, threat information
was too complex and cumbersome to share, limiting its application in
operational environments.]{.underline} The new software standardizes
collection via Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) and
converts complex data on cybersecurity vulnerabilities into a
visualization that is easy to understand and act on. [With STIG, utility
owners and operators have a common system for sharing threat
intelligence information, thus increasing the chances of detecting and
mitigating cyber exploits before they lead to a
cyberattack.]{.underline}

"We've been working on the development of this tool for quite a while
and have had success testing it with a major utility," said Jed Haile,
INL cybersecurity researcher and tool developer. "[This software helps
analysts process new threat information rapidly and makes it easier for
them to find or create relationships between pieces of
information."]{.underline}

By releasing the open-source code on GitHub, [INL researchers hope other
developers will take on the challenge of making the tool even better and
ultimately help better protect the nation's critical infrastructure
systems.]{.underline} Along with Haile, INL Infrastructure Security
Strategic Adviser Rita Foster and cybersecurity researchers Justin Cox
and Zach Priest were instrumental in the tool's development.

The team has been working closely to test the software with Southern
California Edison (SCE), a principal member of the California Energy
Systems for the 21st Century (CES-21) Program, and the primary
electricity supply company for much of Southern California. The company
provides 14 million people with electricity across a service territory
of approximately 50,000 sq miles. SCE sponsored the research that led to
the development of the software. [Seeing the potential for wider
application of structured threat sharing, the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved a request to release the
open-source code.]{.underline}

## Meltdowns CP

- Extend the license renewal of current operating facilities only as
  necessary to replace them with Small Modular Reactors,

- change the national policy to permit the reprocessing of spent fuel,
  and

- replace the current nuclear power plant infrastructure with Small

The hypothesis in this thesis suggests that [if the United States does
not have a strategy for replacing its current fleet of commercial
nuclear power plants, it might find itself short of the baseload power
to sustain the population into the future.]{.underline} To analyze this
problem, it was necessary to understand why the public perceives nuclear
power as a higher risk than other forms of energy. This was accomplished
by finding research already compiled that suggests the cause of these
concerns and ways to improve public confidence moving forward. The
research also had to examine what other nations are doing to address the
recycling and storage of waste as well as new design models that could
be safer and more versatile than traditional, fixed sites.

Using qualitative objectives, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission outlined
its goals in a policy statement (51 Federal Register 30,028), which
states,

• Individual members of the public should be provided a level of
protection from the consequences of nuclear power plant operation such
that individuals bear no significant additional risk to life and health.

• Societal risks to life and health from nuclear power plant operation
should be comparable to or less than the risks of generating electricity
by viable competing technologies and should not be a significant
addition to other societal risks.

[Using data from probabilistic risk assessments, this thesis concluded
that moving ahead with **SMRs is in line with the commission's goals and
even exceeds its expectations**.]{.underline} [The results also indicate
that **other forms of energy have a higher frequency of risk and** with
**more significant impacts on health and the environment than nuclear
power**.]{.underline} [The research also suggests that recycling could
be to the nation\'s advantage by creating additional future fuel for new
reactor designs and reducing waste storage. Also, **SMRs can operate
with a high degree of safety**, and the reduction in off-site
preparedness could be justified.]{.underline}

[Various **recommendations include** 1) **extending the license renewal
of current operating facilities only as necessary to replace them with
SMRs**; 2) **changing the national policy to permit the reprocessing of
spent fuel reduce long-term repositories and keep fuel available well
into the future**; and 3) **replacing the current nuclear power plant
infrastructure with SMRs** or passive systems that will reduce negative
consequences and improve public confidence.]{.underline}

The 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan was a huge blow to the global
nuclear power industry. [After the meltdown, electricity generation from
nuclear dropped 11 percent globally, and has yet to recover. In
developed countries, including the United States, lingering fears have
motivated early plant retirements and cancellations of proposed
projects.]{.underline}

However, nuclear power is seeing a revival in emerging economies, which
are seeking nuclear energy technology from abroad. [**China and Russia
are racing to dominate this space and win geopolitical leverage through
potentially predatory state financing and full construction and
operation packages. The United States, which used to lead in nuclear
technology exports, has fallen behind because of restrictive export
regulations.** To get back in the game---and secure economic and
security advantages that the growing export market presents---the United
States should simplify export controls and invest in innovative nuclear
technologies.]{.underline} To begin the task, the White House should
turn to Saudi Arabia, which is looking to develop its own nuclear energy
program.

We've collected a series of essays and articles exploring nuclear's
growth in the developing world, the commercial and national security
concerns connected to Russia and China's growing control, and policy
options for the current administration to revitalize America's domestic
nuclear industry without sacrificing safety and security.

A New "Half-Life"

Though nuclear power is projected to stagnate in OECD countries through
2040, it is also expected to grow [nearly
fivefold](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/data/browser/#/?id=31-IEO2016&region=0-0&cases=Reference&start=2010&end=2040&f=A&linechart=~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Reference-d021916a.11-31-IEO2016~Reference-d021916a.26-31-IEO2016&map=&ctype=linechart&chartindexed=1&sourcekey=0) in
non-OECD countries in the same time period, with the Middle East and
Asia accounting for much of the growth.

In the latest issue of the [Washington
Quarterly](https://twq.elliott.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs2121/f/downloads/TWQ_Summer2018_HolgateSaha.pdf),
Laura Holgate and Sagatom Saha explore the forces driving this growth.
Among them is the growing need to combat climate change and local
pollution, they write:

"For many developing countries, the dangers that climate change pose are
catastrophic. The 46 most polluted countries and the 146 cities with the
worst air quality are all in the developing world. \[\...\] While China
and India expectedly dominate the list, countries in the Gulf, Southeast
Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa also populate it. These nations may see
China's and India's fates---economic growth at the expense of public
health---as an obstacle to bypass."

[Notably, ten countries accounting for about 40 percent of global energy
demand---including three without reactors---incorporated nuclear into
their Paris climate pledges. Holgate and Saha also expect innovative
designs, **like the nearly-commercial small modular reactor (SMR)**, to
bring nuclear to untapped markets.]{.underline}

[Nuclear has been traditionally limited to the world's wealthiest
nations because today's reactors have high upfront costs and generate
far too much power for smaller electricity grids. **SMRs stand to
eliminate both of these barriers**:]{.underline}

[First, each module of an SMR only generates about 50 megawatts (MW), so
SMRs can be sited on virtually any grid anywhere.]{.underline}

[Second, SMRs are scalable---that is, additional modules can be added
over time as power needs grow and financing becomes
available.]{.underline}

[Third, SMRs have lower construction costs and benefit from economies of
scale as they can be uniformly mass produced in a central factory and
transported by truck or rail.]{.underline}

[For developing countries, the dangers that climate change pose provide
a pressing need for zero-carbon power, and new nuclear designs provide a
viable option. Even in a future with far more wind and solar, nuclear
reactors could benefit---rather than suffer---from renewables' explosive
growth (see a 2017 [Greentech
Media](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/nuclear-can-be-friends-with-renewables#gs.sn14f9k) article

renewables).]{.underline}

  how to counter the challenges posed by China.\
  \]{.underline}
  The recently declassified [U.S. Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific](https://news.usni.org/2021/01/15/u-s-strategic-framework-for-the-indo-pacific), originally published in
  February 2018, provides a synopsis of the challenges the U.S. and its allies face from China.\
  \
  [Among the "assumptions" underlying the strategy are several that are very relevant to how nuclear energy develops in this decade and whether it will be effectively governed for
  the remainder of the century. These include the assertions **that "China will circumvent international rules and norms to gain an advantage" and that "China seeks to dominate
  cutting-edge technologies." \**]{.underline}
  \
  These statements are not new, but when coupled with a
  recent [analysis](https://www.wsj.com/articles/from-lightbulbs-to-5g-china-battles-west-for-control-of-vital-technology-standards-11612722698?mod=searchresults_pos2&page=1) by
  the Wall Street Journal about how China is seeking to control international technology standards across multiple "fields of the future" the resulting picture is very troubling
  when viewed through the lens of global nuclear security.\
  \
  As the Journal report notes, "To the consternation of many Western countries, Beijing is employing state funding and political influence to define the norms for all manner of
  cutting-edge technologies."\
   \
  [The strategy is two-fold -- obtaining positions of influence in international standards organizations and using the Belt and Road Initiative to promote China's preferred
  standards.\
  \
  The transformation of international organizations from within was a major theme in the State Department Policy Planning staff's recently published, [The Elements of the China
  Challenge](https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20407448-elements_of_the_china_challenge-20201117).\
  \
  For the Belt and Road strategy, the Journal report notes that, "China offers countries subsidies to win the work and then uses its standards to lock in partner nations that
  would face major costs in switching to international standards."\]{.underline}
  \
  [Th**e nuclear challenge lies in the development of next-generation nuclear energy technologies and the need to create the standards and governance regime for them so that they
  can be safely and securely deployed anywhere around the globe.\
  \**
  In a recent [analysis](https://www.macfound.org/media/article_pdfs/nuclear-challenges-synthesis-report_public-final-1.29.21.pdf%5b16%5d.pdf) for a major U.S. philanthropic
  foundation, the authors noted that, "the risks and policy implications of these new reactor technologies and their use on a global scale are not currently well
  understood...\[and\]...a framework for managing and minimizing the risks associated with new reactors" needs to be developed where it does not exist.\
  \
  **The development of the next-generation nuclear governance regime is a significant issue because these technologies constitute a significant evolution from existing nuclear
  power reactors. Their smaller size and non-traditional coolants and fuel cycles make them deployable for many different circumstances**. Zero-carbon energy production is the
  primary rationale, but they also can be used for industrial power, hydrogen production, water desalination, and to power military bases and weapons.\]{.underline}
  \
  [The target international market for these reactors is increasingly looking like developing nations with small electric grids, serious climate change impacts, and growing
  populations. Many of these nations are not experienced with nuclear energy operation and additional measures will be required to prepare them for this task.\
  \
  This process could create a potential battleground between the U.S. and China with effective **nuclear nonproliferation and security standards hanging in the
  balance**.]{.underline}\
  \
  [One arena where this conflict could play out is at the International Atomic Energy Agency. It will need to evolve its current approach to preparing new nuclear nations to
  account for the unique features of the novel nuclear technologies.]{.underline} That will require the approval of many different nations. [Historically, the nations that are
  most aggressively selling into the global nuclear market have greater influence over international guidelines. That precedent argues for being the first to cultivate
  next-generation nuclear clients if a country wants to set the new governance baseline.\]{.underline}
  \
  [Additional support to these new nuclear nations likely will need to be provided by the reactor suppliers and their national governments. This process is not well established
  among democratic nation nuclear exporters, placing them at a disadvantage. But it is a core element of the export strategy of state-owned nuclear enterprises, like those in
  China.\
  \
  The technology race between the U.S. and China on next-generation nuclear power has been developing under the radar. But losing that race could become a high-profile failure for
  global security if it results in weakened security and nonproliferation standards.]{.underline}\
  \
  [If China is able to establish a next-generation nuclear power beachhead in one or several developing countries before new international nuclear governance rules are established
  for these technologies, **it can tailor the guidelines to its advantage and lock them in. That could intensify nuclear dangers in an already precarious international security
  environment.\**
  \
  That argues for American aggressiveness, perseverance, and effectiveness in developing and positioning its next-generation technologies. As the President said, "they're going to
  eat our lunch" if the country does not get moving.]{.underline}

financial benefits and shape global standards for decades.]{.underline}
[If we are going to succeed in this very lucrative market in the
long-term, we have to keep inventing better nuclear technologies that
consumers will want---and competitors will want to copy.]{.underline}

The good news is, we're well positioned to deliver these new
technologies. Over 50 companies and organizations in the U.S. are
working to commercialize advanced nuclear reactor technologies. From a
technical perspective, many of our companies are further along than
those in China and Russia, though both countries can overtake us if we
fail to play our cards right. [The federal government can help U.S.
innovators maintain their head start by accelerating nuclear research,
development and demonstration and helping to scale up deployment of
small modular reactors (SMRs).]{.underline}

SMRs have a number of advantages over today's large GW nuclear reactors.
Because of their size (under 300 MW vs. 1,000 MW for today's reactors),
[SMRs can be built in a controlled factory setting and installed
module-by-module, enhancing the level of construction quality,
increasing efficiency, and lowering cost. Their size, versatility, and
passive safety features are also attractive to countries with smaller
grids and less experience with nuclear power. Taken together, these
features make SMRs more useful and easier to finance.]{.underline}

[But to get SMRs ready for export abroad, the U.S. must first
demonstrate readiness at home. Vendors have to gain experience with
licensing and constructing SMRs so that the U.S. nuclear supply chain
remains robust. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is essential to this
mission and has supported the development of SMR technology through the
SMR Licensing Technical Support (LTS) Program.]{.underline} They are now
working with companies to accelerate the licensing and siting process.
[DOE's SMR development efforts are making great progress, and they
should be continued and expanded to assist with manufacturing, assembly,
and operation of SMRs at home and for export]{.underline}. A substantial
ramp up of federal funding for SMRs beginning in fiscal year 2018 will
ensure that U.S. technologies reach the global market ahead of our
competitors and lock-in a significant amount of lucrative long-term
contracts.

[NuScale's reactor is also America's best chance to compete in the
global SMR market as it gets started and puts the U.S. on a path to beat
foreign competitors like Argentina, China, Russia and South Korea who
are developing their own SMR designs]{.underline}. Conservative
estimates predict between 55 and 75 GW of electricity will come from
operating SMRs around the world by 2035, the equivalent of more than
1,000 NuScale Power Modules, and will bring the market up towards a
trillion dollars. SMR developers expect modular designs and construction
processes will generate economies of series and open up multiple supply
opportunities. NuScale has estimated its first plant will cost just
under \$3 billion to build, giving an overnight capital cost of
\$5,078/kWe. Mr Conca states "But the real power of SMRs are the fact
that they can't melt down. This is a big deal. [It means the reactor
just won't melt down or otherwise cause any of the nightmares people
think about when imagining the worse for nuclear power. It just shuts
down and cools off. No humans or computers are needed to intervene, no
AC or DC power, no pumps, and no additional water for
cooling."]{.underline} [The report further states that "A couple of
additional features are: 1) no one can hack this reactor and 2)
refuelling of this reactor does not require the nuclear plant to shut
down. The components of the NuScale reactor can all be manufactured in a
factory prior to shipping and assembly at the site, removing a major
cost issue with building new nuclear plants.]{.underline} Traditional
nuclear reactors are between about 600 and 1,200 MW, but these small
power modules are about 50 MW each and 12 of them can be put together to
make a power plant up to 600 MW - a 12-pack. These modules use standard
17x17 PWR fuel assemblies, also making them cost-effective, at only half
the height, with an average U-235 enrichment of 3.8%. A single NuScale
nuclear power module is 76-feet tall and 15-feet in diameter, and would
sit in a plant covering less than a tenth of a square mile or about 60
acres. In comparison, it takes at least 130,000 acres, or about 200
square miles, of wind farms to produce the same amount of energy as one
NuScale 12-pack is designed to. These innovative designs bring the total
life-cycle cost to produce electricity with this SMR to below that of
most other energy sources, just slightly above hydro and natural gas.
This SMR can also be constructed in about half the time of traditional
nuclear plants. In summary SNR's: Significantly reduced environmental
and health risks Reduces capital expenditure Reduces complexity Less
development time required Lower power costs Reduced land area required
to build The future for nuclear power is looking brighter thanks to the
efforts of NuScale and other developers of SNR's.

Nuclear may soon be getting a boost from Washington State in the
north-west of the U.S. There, a bill is being presented to promote the
manufacture and deployment of new nuclear reactors. It will provide
generous tax incentives to nuclear investments in the state[. It's the
sort of support that renewable energy technology is used to, yet nuclear
struggles to get because of critics of nuclear energy.]{.underline}
[That opposition is very frustrating, explains James Conca, who quotes
the IEA as saying nuclear is the lowest cost low-carbon energy source
for the long-term.]{.underline} Washington State is one place that
already has low-cost nuclear, so the population should be receptive.
[Conca points at advanced, small modular reactors already in the
pipeline from TerraPower, X-energy, NuScale and Terrestrial
Energy.]{.underline} He says the next generation of nuclear plants are
almost ready, and Washington State has the nuclear-approved locations,
experienced operators and maintenance personnel waiting for their
arrival if and when the bill is passed. The Washington State Senate
Environment, Energy & Technology Committee drafted a new bill, SB 5244,
encouraging the production of advanced nuclear reactors, small modular
reactors, and components through the Invest in Washington Act. Expanding
nuclear power is important to address both climate change and to
stimulate domestic manufacturing of the energy source America originally
developed. These include small modular reactors that have a gross power
output below 350 MW of electricity, are designed for factory
manufacturing and ease of transport, or both, and advanced nuclear
reactors having significant improvements over the present nuclear
fission reactors, or a reactor employing nuclear fusion. Also included
are components of these reactors. Tax incentives The Invest in
Washington program provides sales and use tax deferral on the
construction and cost of new, renovated, or expanded manufacturing
facilities. The program was established to evaluate the effectiveness of
a program providing a tax incentive for businesses that invest in
manufacturing facilities and equipment and reinvest those tax savings in
employee training programs in the State of Washington. There is no
interest charged on deferred taxes, and the taxes may be repaid over a
ten-year period. These kinds of programs are needed to encourage new
energy technologies as they get over the hurdles that usually beset new
technologies. [**And these nuclear technologies are needed to address
global warming and other energy-related challenges in the future. In

[valuable]{.mark} tools [for diplomacy]{.mark}**]{.underline},
especially in regions --- like the Korean Peninsula --- locked in
conflict. [The Cuban missile crisis inspired the creation of the first
nuclear hotline]{.underline}. During the two weeks in October 1962 when
the United States and the Soviet Union approached the precipice of
thermonuclear war, U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Soviet First
Secretary Nikita Khrushchev struggled to control events. Khrushchev
famously warned Kennedy: "If we succeeded in finding a way out of a
dangerous situation this time, next time we might not safely untie the
tightly made knot." The absence of direct communications between the two
leaders tightened the knot as they struggled to understand each other's
motives and actions.The absence of direct communications between the two
leaders tightened the knot as they struggled to understand each other's
motives and actions. Technological limitations, security concerns, and
hostile Cold War attitudes made a point-to-point telephone line from the
White House to the Kremlin impossible at that time. Instead, Kennedy and
Khrushchev had to rely on intermediaries, including their ambassadors,
who were underinformed and distrusted. They created special "back
channels" to open new lines of negotiation, but these were often
unreliable. Most significant unplanned events during the crisis,
including the shoot-down of an American U-2 aircraft over Cuba,
threatened to trigger major miscalculations and escalation. Leaders had
long relied on diplomats, spies, and other intermediaries for their
communications with adversaries. The difference in 1962 was that the
speed and depth of potential destruction in a thermonuclear world
reduced the time for deliberation and increased the dangers of
miscalculation. Kennedy and Khrushchev felt that they needed to talk
with more urgency and sobriety than their predecessors. They began by
exchanging letters after the moment of acute crisis had passed. Then, in
March 1963, the United States proposed "the establishment of direct and
more secure communications" between American and Soviet leaders. On June
20, the two governments signed a memorandum of understanding in Geneva
--- the first arms control agreement of the Cold War --- to create "a
direct communications link" and "take the necessary steps to ensure
continuous functioning of the link and prompt delivery to its head of
government of any communications received by means of the link from the
head of government of the other party." Implementation came quickly,
reflecting the eagerness of leaders in both capitals. On July 13, 1963,
the first Soviet-American hotline became operational. It consisted of
two pairs of Teletype machines, linked by dedicated telegraph wires
routed through Europe and under the Atlantic Ocean. The receivers sat in
the Pentagon and the Soviet Communist Party Headquarters, where they
were continuously manned to receive messages and send them immediately
to the White House and Kremlin. The communication between leaders was
still textual and indirect, but the time required was reduced from days
and hours to minutes, and the possibilities for distortion were
minimized. In 1967, the White House added a terminal, connected to the
Pentagon receivers, and over the next four decades the technology was
updated to include satellite communications, facsimile equipment, and
eventually, in 2008, email. [The superpowers communicated through the
hotline **during numerous crises**]{.underline}, [beginning with the
assassination of President Kennedy in November 1963, when Washington
assured Moscow of political stability within the United
State]{.underline}s. The first extended exchange occurred [during the
1967 Six-Day War]{.underline}, when American and Soviet leaders
reassured one another that they would not intervene directly and would
mutually sue for peace in the region. Similar communications during the
[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Yom Kippur War of 1973, and the Cyprus
crisis of 1974 **clarified the lines of deterrence in

W.J. **Hennigan 22,** U.S. Russia Open Hotline To Avert Clashes, Time,

Amid rising tensions over the war in Ukraine, the [U.S.
military]{.underline} has [established a communications hotline with
Russian forces to **prevent an accidental clash** between the two
nuclear powers, two U.S. defense officials say]{.underline}. The
so-called [de-confliction line is intended to ensure that the two
countries' pilots or warships **do not mistakenly fire** upon one
another as they conduct daily missions in eastern Europe.]{.underline}

The military-to-military channel, which will run out of U.S. European
Command headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany, was set up March 1 after
the Russians responded to the Pentagon's request. [**Maintaining
communications to avoid accidental confrontations** between the forces
is critical, officials say, so hostilities don't spiral out of control.
"It's really important that we don't risk accident or miscalculation,"
said a U.S. official]{.underline}, who was not authorized to speak
publicly on the matter.

American forces are not fighting inside Ukraine, where Russia has
deployed more than 100,000 troops and is carrying out daily bombing
runs, but both militaries are now operating near each other along
Ukraine's borders. The U.S. has sent fighter jets to multiple countries
on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) eastern flank for air
policing flights in solidarity with the transatlantic alliance. [Now
that the hotline is in place, it may prevent a collision or an
accidental shoot-down in eastern Europe, U.S. officials
said.]{.underline}

It is [not the first time the two nations have created such a
mechanism]{.underline}. The [U.S. and Russian military established a
back-channel after Russia entered Syria's multi-sided civil war in
2015.]{.underline} Russia was there to prop up its ally, Syrian
President Bashar Assad, while the U.S. flew sorties to bomb ISIS
strongholds and deployed special forces for targeted missions on the
ground. At the time, the [de-confliction line]{.underline} consisted of
an insecure phone line and a Google mail account, but it [proved useful
in avoiding a catastrophic accident.]{.underline}

Pentagon sets up hotline with Russia to avert Ukraine 'miscalculation'

The [Pentagon has established a new hotline with Russia's ministry of
defense to prevent "**miscalculation, military incidents and
escalation**" in the region as Russia's invasion of Ukraine advances, a
US official told Reuters on Thursday]{.underline}.

The US says it has no troops in Ukraine but it and Nato allies in Europe
are worried about potential spillover, including accidents, as Russia
stages the largest assault on a European state since the second world
war.

The US and its allies are also channeling millions of dollars' worth of
weaponry to Ukraine's armed forces, which are using the arms against
Russian troops, despite Moscow's warnings against foreign interference.

"The [D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f the [D]{.underline}efense
recently established a [de-confliction line with the Russian ministry of
defense on March 1 for the purposes of preventing miscalculation,
military incidents, and escalation," a senior US defense official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity]{.underline}, confirming a move first
reported by NBC.

The [US military has successfully **created hotlines with Russia in the
past,** including during the war in Syria]{.underline}, where Moscow
intervened on the side of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.

There, the US and Russia were waging parallel military campaigns, with
the US focused on battling Islamic State.

The move is [just the latest effort to lower soaring tension between the
US and Russia, where the Russian president, Vladimir Putin -- in a clear
warning to the west -- announced last weekend he was putting his nuclear
forces on high alert.]{.underline}

Putin's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was quoted on Wednesday warning
that a third world war would be a nuclear conflict, remarks that added
to growing unease.

The US military said on Wednesday it would postpone a scheduled test
launch of a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile.

"We recognize, at this moment of tension, [how critical it is that both
the United States and Russia bear in mind the risk of miscalculation and
**take steps to reduce those risks**]{.underline}," the Pentagon
spokesman, John Kirby, said on Wednesday, announcing the move.

[World **needs 'no first use' pledge** by US, NATO and Russia to **avoid
nuclear war**]{.underline}

Nuclear weapons look awfully important again. [Given Russian President
Vladimir Putin's not-so-thinly veiled warning of a nuclear
attack,]{.underline} it is a fool's errand to talk about nuclear
disarmament now. [One can imagine that North Korea thinks it is
fortunate to have developed nuclear weapons]{.underline}, and one [can
only guess which would-be nuclear state might crop up next in Asia and
the Middle East.]{.underline}

We are [stepping into a nuclear jungle where nukes are like
**low-hanging fruit swaying enticingly**]{.underline}. But if "a nuclear
war cannot be won and must never be fought", as the five nuclear powers
vowed in a joint statement in January, then one realistic step is that
they pledge not to be the first to use or threaten to use nuclear
weapons against each other.

[This is possible for all nuclear powers as it **won't compromise**
their effective deterrence]{.underline}. Since it detonated a nuclear
device in 1964, China has pledged a policy of "no first use" of nuclear
weapons at any time and under any circumstances. It says its nuclear
strategies and policies are the most stable, sustainable and predictable
among the nuclear powers.

The [US D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense
[announced last month in its Nuclear Posture Review that it "would only
consider the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defend
the vital interests of the United States or its allies and
partners]{.underline}". Such a view is a step back from US President Joe
Biden's previous position that the sole purpose of the US nuclear
arsenal is deterring -- and if necessary, retaliating against -- a
nuclear attack. [Such a position is only a **stone's throw** from a no
first use policy.]{.underline}

[The United States can afford to make a no first use **commitment** more
than any other country because it has overwhelming conventional military
superiority]{.underline}. One can hardly cite a mission the US could not
accomplish with conventional weapons.

The gap between the conventional forces of the People's Liberation Army
and the US military is closing in the western Pacific, but it is
difficult to imagine a potential conflict in which the US would have to
launch a nuclear strike first against China.

US, China, Russia, Britain and France [pledge to **only use nuclear
weapons for defense**]{.underline}

The [primary concern over America's nuclear policy comes from US allies
who are worried about their security without the American nuclear
umbrella. "Great powers don't commit suicide for their
allies]{.underline}", as Henry Kissinger is often quoted as saying.

They do not have to worry. [Knowing a nuclear strike on any US ally will
almost **certainly invite** a devastating nuclear retaliation, an
adversary is unlikely to launch a nuclear strike first]{.underline}. If
the [US could negotiate a "no first use" agreement with North Korea, it
might **discourage Pyongyang** from further developing]{.underline}
nuclear weapons.

[Mutual assurance on no first use can serve as the first step in
**establishing strategic stability** between Beijing and
Washington]{.underline}. The Pentagon reportedly worries that China
could triple its nuclear arsenal to 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030.

Even if this turns out to be true, China's nuclear stockpile is still
only a fraction of that of the US. To talk about nuclear equilibrium,
China would have to drastically increase its number of nuclear weapons
or the US would have to reduce its stockpile to China's level. Neither
is possible.

The real challenge is how to get Russia involved. In June 1982, Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev made the no first use pledge at the United
Nations because Moscow was confident about the advantages of its
conventional military forces on the battlefield over NATO in Europe. As
the Russian conventional military forces deteriorated after the collapse
of the Soviet Union in 1989, Russia dropped its pledge in 1993.

[If Russia believes its "escalate to de-escalate" strategy has deterred
the US from sending troops to intervene in Ukraine]{.underline}, it
needs to think again. [No matter how formidable nuclear weapons seem,
they **did not help the US** in Vietnam, Iraq or
Afghanistan.]{.underline}

They have not helped Moscow in mitigating Ukraine's strong resistance
against Russia's invasion, either. Instead, Putin's threat on the
possible use of nuclear weapons has severely tarnished the image of
Russia. In a 2018 documentary, Putin asked, "why do we need a world
without Russia in it?". The better question is, where would Russia be
without the world?

Security in Europe rests on whether Russia and NATO can eventually make
a deal. [The transatlantic alliance can **afford to pledge no first
use**]{.underline}, even unilaterally, [against a Russia which relies on
nuclear weapons more than ever.]{.underline} It is hard to imagine why
Russia would in any circumstances launch a nuclear strike against a
grouping that has 30 member states, including three with nuclear
weapons.

China steps up pace in new nuclear arms race with US and Russia

In 2001, [**Russia and China agreed** not to be the first to use nuclear
weapons against each other or target strategic nuclear missiles against
each other. If a similar agreement could be made between China and the
US, then **reaching an agreement between the US, NATO and Russia would
become easier.**]{.underline}

Here is a good lesson to learn. In the wake of the nuclear tests by
India and Pakistan in 1998, China and the US came to a joint declaration
that they would not target each other with their nuclear weapons to
demonstrate solidarity. This led to a joint statement among the five
nuclear-weapon states in 2000 that their nuclear weapons are not
targeted at each other or at any other states.

## Space Wars CP

### 1NC\-\--Space Wars CP

#### The United States federal government should:

#### -Create a new international Agreement centered around space security

#### -Use certain countermeasures towards kinetic and other attacks

#### A new international agreement would be greatly helpful towards space security

**Moltz 14** (James Clay, Chairman of the Department of National
Security Affairs at the Naval Postgraduate school)

At the far end of the options spectrum is the possibility of [new
international agreements]{.underline} involving larger numbers of
actors. [These include codes of conduct, conventions]{.underline} (such
as the 2007 UN Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines), [and formal
treaties]{.underline}. Depending on the nature of the agreements, the
level of domestic approval required, and the intrusiveness of
verification and/or enforcement mechanisms, negotiating these
arrangements can be more (or less) difficult. [But formal agreements do
offer real advantages in terms of reliability, stability, clarity of
rules, effectiveness of implementation, and longevity.]{.underline}
U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control efforts would have been ineffective
without treaties and effective verification. Similarly, worldwide
efforts to prohibit and destroy chemical weapons would not have been as
successful as they have been without the 1993 Chemical Weapons
Convention, its timeline for dismantlement, and its verification
mechanisms. Space may have specific threatening activities that could be
most effectively addressed by treaties as well. To support such efforts,
it [may also be beneficial to create an international space monitoring
organization to supplement or work alongside existing U.S. military
systems]{.underline}. The [U.S. Air Force is already working in this
direction through its cooperation with allies]{.underline} and even, on
a more limited basis, with China, to provide warning of potential
collisions involving their spacecraft. But the United States cannot be
expected to pay for such an international mechanism. If countries want
the benefits of enhanced transparency and the stability it could bring,
they are going to have to devote adequate resources to the task, just as
the United States has done out of its own national security interests in
developing its Joint Space Operations Center. Private companies have
also begun to pool resources in the Space Data Association (mentioned in
chapter 4). It remains to be seen if the countries that are worried
about space weapons tests, orbital debris, and various types of harmful
interference will be able to cooperate both politically and financially
to support the creation of such a system.

the target. As a result, [it is unclear whether a cyber operation would
be able to negate an adversary space system in a timely
manner.]{.underline} If the goal is to permanently destroy an adversary
space weapon in orbit, electronic warfare systems might not be deemed
sufficient to eliminate the threat. [Kinetic space weapons can be
unreliable, too.]{.underline} Program 437, for example, had multiple
problems with its ability to accurately target adversary satellites.
Destroying a satellite requires highly accurate locational data that can
be quickly transmitted to the anti-satellite weapon operator. If the
targeting information from a space surveillance network is out-of-date
because of a minor satellite maneuver, for example, the anti-satellite
weapon could miss its target. For countries like Iran and North Korea
that have the capability to build rudimentary kinetic anti-satellite
systems, their [space surveillance networks are likely not robust enough
to field an effective weapon]{.underline}. Given the technical challenge
involved, it is not clear if even the space surveillance networks of
China and Russia can reliably target U.S. satellites or vice versa.
While these adversary programs should be monitored, the United States
and its allies should not overreact to them. To prevent the arms
competition in space from becoming even more dangerous[, Washington
should work with its allies and adversaries to establish a moratorium on
testing kinetic weapons in space.]{.underline} Concerns about
verification mechanisms have been the primary impediment to progress on
limiting kinetic space weapons. During the Cold War, U.S. officials
believed the Soviet Union would be able to effectively conceal ground-
and space-based weapons. Debris generated from tests cannot, however, be
hidden. Focusing on banning kinetic testing is a feasible and immediate
step to be taken. Due to increased awareness about space security issues
among U.S. allies, [now is the time to collectively develop a framework
for preventing these harmful tests that create long-term hazards for
both civil and military space operations.]{.underline}

[[U.S. policymakers must take specific actions with clear]{.mark} policy
[objectives to preserve]{.mark} a [rules-based global standards]{.mark}
ecosystem, adhering to and maintain a market- and consumer-driven
innovation agenda (rather than one that is state-driven), [and
technology selection]{.mark} based on consensus and merit.]{.underline}

[[Various parts of]{.mark} the U.S. administration have recognized the
importance of maintaining [U.S. leadership]{.mark} in standards [that
are critical for]{.mark} economic [growth and]{.mark} national
[security]{.mark}:]{.underline}

- [[Executive action]{.mark}:]{.underline} Last year, for example, the
  National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI)
  released a final report making critical recommendations for
  maintaining U.S. leadership in AI standards. [Various actions by the
  administration have underlined the importance of maintaining
  leadership in 5G standards, including the president's Executive Order
  on "Promoting Competition in the American Economy" in July
  2021.]{.underline}

- [[Cooperate with allies and strategic partners]{.underline}]{.mark}:
  The United States should work with its allies and strategic partners
  [to establish and maintain a rules-based ecosystem
  globally.]{.underline} Currently, this should include greater
  attention to cooperation on standards issues through the U.S.- EU
  Trade and Technology Council and the Quad initiative with Australia,
  India, and Japan.

- [[Congressional action]{.underline}]{.mark}: Congress can [outline key
  design principles and relevant interagency processes to guide the
  development and coordination of standards through the
  reconciliation]{.underline} of the USICA COMPETES In particular,
  [Congress should give NIST a directive to work]{.underline} on a
  companion of the existing Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
  directive for tighter linkage between innovation and standards policy
  and investment. The policy of the United States regarding the role of
  government in the standards process is outlined in OMB Circular A-119.

Taken together, [[these actions should contribute]{.mark}
[to]{.mark}:]{.underline}

- [[Maintaining a]{.mark} robust intellectual property rights ([IPR)
  regime]{.mark}:]{.underline} [To maintain the incentives of U.S. firms
  to participate in long-term and risky R&D that is required to be an
  innovation leader and lead in critical standards]{.underline},
  protecting the ability of U.S. firms to monetize their IP in
  international markets is the first step.

- [[Establishing strong governance principles]{.underline}]{.mark}:
  Setting out strong governance principles [for SDOs based on openness,
  transparency, consensus, and majority voting will avoid
  gamesmanship]{.underline} and maintain a rules-based merit-driven
  ecosystem.

- [[Maintaining global standards]{.underline}]{.mark}: It is critical
  that global standards are maintained, both for U.[S. firms to maintain
  a market-driven incentive in investing in standards]{.underline} (due
  to an economy of scale that would be lost in a bifurcated world where
  firms are forced to work only on national standards), [and for the
  world to have the best technologies]{.underline} (due to the
  innovation agenda being set based on the market and not based on a
  state's direction).

- [[Promoting U.S. government interagency and public-private
  coordination]{.underline}]{.mark}: Such action [might entail
  reinstating and chartering the National Science and Technology Council
  (NSTC) interagency subcommittee on standards for this purpose, and
  promoting investments made by the U.S. government that leverage and
  accelerate private sector commitments to advance U.S. standards
  leadership---such as those based on tax-incentives, direct
  investments, and the ability to utilize federal R&D funds towards
  standards-relevant technologies.]{.underline}

- [[Investing in standards-based skill sets for U.S.
  workers:]{.underline}]{.mark} Increasing the United States' focus and
  investment for standards literacy in higher education and research
  [should be a critical step in driving home the importance of this work
  to U.S. global leadership]{.underline}. The United States, via the
  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), currently
  provides limited funding, on the order of \$400,000 per year for
  standards education and curriculum advancement in the United States.
  The United States' global competitors invest substantially in this
  capacity. Additionally, the investment by NIST in international
  relationships for standards and metrology, including education and
  capacity development, is dwarfed by those investments being made by
  Europe and Asia, and particularly by China.

## Ukraine CP

### 1NC\-\--Ukraine

#### The United States federal government should:

#### Declare that Ukraine will not be admitted to NATO

#### Remove their offensive nuclear missiles from Russia\'s borders

#### Withdraw nuclear missiles from countries adjoining Russia

#### Give Russia an explicit plan on what they can do to reduce tensions

#### The Ukraine crisis can be ended tomorrow 

**Freeman 22\[**Robert, Freeman is Founder and Executive Director of The
Global Uplift Project which builds small-scale infrastructure projects
in the developing world to improve humanity's capacity for
self-development. Robert taught economics and history at Los Altos High
School where he also coached the Speech and Debate team, including
producing a national champion in 2006., "How the US Could Solve the
Ukraine Crisis Tomorrow", 3/7/22,
<https://www.commondreams.org/views/2022/03/07/how-us-could-solve-ukraine-crisis-tomorrow>\]

[If the U.S. is sincerely interested in a peaceful resolution of the
crisis]{.underline}---and for argument\'s sake, let\'s assume that it
is---[it can attain that end with two simple moves: declare that Ukraine
will not be admitted into NATO; and remove its offensive nuclear
missiles from Russia\'s borders.]{.underline}

[Since Ukraine is not a matter of strategic interest to the U.S., this
would come at little cost to the U.S. but will yield vastly
disproportional gains to the situation by facilitating immediate
de-escalation]{.underline}.   [Both the U.S. and NATO have stated
informally that Ukraine will not be admitted anyway, so nothing, save,
perhaps a little face, is lost.  It would allow Russia to withdraw with
something to be said for its efforts.]{.underline}

As for the second plank of the solution---[withdrawal of U.S. nuclear
missiles from countries adjoining Russia]{.underline}---the U.S.
understands better than any nation on earth the value of having
offensive nuclear missiles removed from its borders. [It knows, from
first-hand experience, better than any nation in the world, how to
defuse this crisis.]{.underline}

[This is the concept of \"strategic empathy:\" understanding your
adversary\'s interests and motivations, not to give in to them, but to
better attain your own ends]{.underline}. As Walt, Kennan, and other
analysts have said, Russia feels aggressed upon, threatened, and out of
peaceful options. [**If the U.S.\'s ends are peace, the means are at
hand to achieve i**t, and with no loss of strategic
position.]{.underline}

[If the U.S.\'s interests are not peace, that will be revealed equally
as clearly, equally as quickly.]{.underline} Yes, there will be
necessary negotiations about withdrawal, reparations, and other such
wind-downs, [but those pale next to the threat of unintended escalation
to what could very easily end up as nuclear war.]{.underline}

[The stakes are huge. Simple, workable solutions are at hand. The costs
are small. The alternatives are unfathomable**. If the U.S. wants peace,
it can have it tomorrow**.]{.underline}

#### The U.S. can convince Putin to end the war

**Beauchamp 22** \[Zack, senior correspondent at Vox, where he covers
global politics and ideology, and a host of Worldly, Vox\'s podcast on
foreign policy and international relations., "How the US and its allies
can help Ukraine without starting World War III", 3/3/2022,
<https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22958725/ukraine-russia-us-nato-sanctions-military-aid-protest>\]

[While the current Western approach has been good at raising the costs
of Putin's invasion, it's less obvious exactly how it's supposed to end
it.]{.underline}

[One common misconception about sanctions, in particular, is that they
work by brute force]{.underline}: that the target country suffers so
much economic pain that they unilaterally give up on the policy the
sanctioner dislikes. [In actuality, sanctions more typically work when
used as a negotiating tool --- serving as a stick, accompanied by
diplomatic carrots.]{.underline}

The Iranian nuclear program sanctions are a good example.

For years prior to the 2015 deal, the US and its allies had imposed
harsh sanctions on Iran as punishment for its nuclear program --- but
Iran had refused to unilaterally cease its efforts. It took serious
negotiations, and a whole raft of complex provisions in a final deal,
for the US to convince Iran to accept limits on its nuclear program in
exchange for sanctions relief. When Trump tore up the Iran deal, and
returned to sanctions absent serious negotiations, Iran [returned right
back to nuclear
development](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2021-12/news/irans-nuclear-growth-puts-deal-risk#:~:text=In%20January%202021%2C%20Iran%20began,%2C%20January%2FFebruary%202021.)).

[In the Ukraine context, the US and its allies have not publicly laid
out a plan for any kind of negotiated Russian climbdown. It's not even
clear that they have one: [Politico's Alex
Ward ](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2022/03/01/tell-us-how-the-ukraine-war-ends-00012878)spoke
to several US and European officials and found that only one even had a
"clear-ish plan" for deescalating the sanctions.]{.underline}

[Unless they've been considerably clearer in their communications with
Russia, this vagueness makes the entire US strategy less effective ---
at least if the aim is to arrive at some kind of political settlement
that ends the war short of regime change in Kyiv.]{.underline}

["If the goal is to compel, then the sanctioners **need to be explicit
about what Russia can do to get the sanctions lifted**," Dan
Drezner,]{.underline} a political scientist at Tufts University who
studies sanctions, [writes in the Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/03/01/what-is-plan-behind-sanctioning-russia/).
["Lack of clarity undermines coercive bargaining, because the targeted
actor believes that sanctions will stay in place no matter what they
do."]{.underline}

There are several ways to go about this. Charap proposes trading relief
of the central bank sanctions for a ceasefire, at least temporarily.
[More broadly, the West and Ukraine could pair sanctions relief with
some diplomatic concessions --- reassurance that US troops will never be
stationed in Ukraine, for example --- as part of a broader peace
package.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Solvency\-\--Ukraine

#### Neutral Ukraine will solve war

**Falk 22** \[Thomas, Thomas O. Falk is a journalist and political
commentator. He has covered politics for The Spectator, The Diplomat, GB
News, Haaretz, South China Morning Post and others, "Ukraine: What does
neutrality mean, and could it lead to peace?", 3/15/22,
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/15/ukraine-what-does-neutrality-mean-and-could-it-lead-to-peace\]

"Russia does not have the desire or capacity to fully occupy the
country. **[Neutrality is a panacea to solving the current
crisis]{.underline}**, and Finland is the model that provides a
reasonable path ahead," Moustakis said.

However, questions remain about what neutrality would mean to Ukraine,
Katharine AM Wright, senior lecturer in international politics at
Newcastle University, told Al Jazeera.

"For any conditions made by \[Ukraine President Volodymyr\] Zelenskyy to
be realistic, they will need to have the buy-in of Ukrainians who have
lived in the shadow of an increasingly aggressive neighbour for a long
time and have now seen their worst fears come to fruition," she said.

"[A neutral Ukraine would no longer be a NATO partner]{.underline},
although other neutral states, notably Finland and Sweden, are NATO
partners[. Such a pathway to NATO membership, however unlikely it is to
be fulfilled, will be a red line for Putin who views Ukraine
differently]{.underline}.

"For Putin, Ukraine is part of an imagined 'Russian World' or community
built on the markers of the Russian language, culture and a 'common
glorious past' in a way Finland and Sweden are not, and this has been a
driving motivation behind the decision to invade Ukraine," Wright said.

[The most pressing issue now is whether neutrality could deliver
peace.]{.underline}

"[A neutral Ukraine would need to seek security ties outside of NATO to
prevent a recurrence of an invasion, given Russia is the aggressor this
would need to come from them, but Ukraine would likely look to other
members of the UN Security Council \[China, France, UK, US\] to help
uphold this]{.underline}," Wright noted.

[Overall, experts seem to agree that **neutrality is the way
forward**.]{.underline}

"It would go a long way towards solving it. In his ideal world, Putin
may have dreamed of a Ukraine united with Russia in a single overarching
state form, but events of the last weeks have shown that is a highly
unlikely outcome," said Graham Gill, professor emeritus at the
University of Sydney.

He told Al Jazeera that "while there is still a substantial pro-Russian
sentiment in some parts of the country, the invasion has soured many
Ukrainians' views of the Russians".

He added: "[Putin will hopefully realise unification is not on the
cards. At least in the short term,]{.underline} a Ukrainian government
that enjoys wide authority in the country is unlikely to be pro-Russian
in outlook. [Neutrality may then appear more attractive]{.underline}."

[At the start of the crisis, Putin has demanded that NATO guarantee
non-membership for Ukraine and sought the withdrawal of NATO forces away
from the Russian border.]{.underline}

"[These were rejected out of hand by NATO and US leaders]{.underline},"
Gill said. "[Had those negotiations been undertaken realistically, the
conflict may have been avoided. Unfortunately, I doubt either NATO or
the US will draw that conclusion because to do so would be to admit some
responsibility for the conflict."]{.underline}

Wright concurred, [saying that a neutral Ukraine is "likely to be key to
a peaceful resolution of the current conflict and to bring an end to the
Russian invasion]{.underline}".

[However, the resolution of this conflict will rely on significant
concessions on both sides, and Putin as the aggressor will want to
withdraw his forces without losing face.]{.underline}

[The idea of neutrality is likely to be a central part of any
negotiations]{.underline}.

"The key message of the war in Ukraine is that every state should rely
purely on its own forces for deterrence [... In order to maintain peace
and stability, it is sometimes necessary to surrender some of your
ideals]{.underline}," Moustakis said.

He added that in the end, "**[neutrality is not only realistic but also
reasonable and pragmatic]{.underline}**".

## Warming CP

### 1NC\-\--Warming CP

#### \-\--make a big machine that sucks carbon.

#### The carbon vacuum!

Lauren **Sommer 22,** Vacuuming carbon from the air could help stop
climate change. Not everyone agrees, NPR.org, 5-2-2022,
https://www.npr.org/2022/05/02/1095097566/carbon-dioxide-removal-climate-emissions/shppp

The world has moved so slowly over the last 40 years to rein in
greenhouse gases that scientists are now finding that cutting the use of
fossil fuels alone may not be enough to stave off the worst effects of
climate change. The world is on track for increasingly destructive heat
waves, floods and storms. [That means heat-trapping gases may also
**need to be pulled out of the atmosphere.**]{.underline}

It\'s [known as \"carbon dioxide removal]{.underline}.\" In the latest
international climate assessment, [scientists found that using it will
be \"unavoidable\" if countries are going to meet their pledges to keep
average global temperatures from rising to ever-harmful
levels.]{.underline}

![Diagram Description automatically generated with medium
confidence](media/image1.png){width="6.387489063867017in"
height="5.976445756780403in"}

[Much of the technology to soak up carbon is still **in its
infancy**]{.underline}. Some techniques can have significant impacts on
the land. Some climate activists argue it\'s a risky distraction and
that it would give the fossil fuel industry a free pass to keep
operating.

Still, scientists running the numbers say the world has reached a point
where every possible strategy is needed. Global emissions are still
going the wrong direction. In 2021, they reached the highest level ever.

Why [scientists say carbon removal is needed]{.underline}

To stave off extreme climate change impacts that could displace millions
of people, scientific data shows that greenhouse gas emissions need to
fall fast. Emissions need to drop 43% by 2030 and then fall to net-zero
by midcentury, in order to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7
degrees Fahrenheit).

Some solutions to cut emissions, like using renewable energy, are
already widespread and cost-effective. But some emissions will be
trickier to tackle. Farming produces emissions both from disturbing the
soil and from the use of fertilizers, which provide food for soil
microbes that release heat-trapping gases. The technology to create
aircraft and oceangoing shipping vessels that don\'t produce emissions
is still experimental. Some industrial processes, like steelmaking,
require fuels that create extremely high heat.

How does carbon removal work?

Simply put, the idea is to [absorb carbon dioxide emissions that have
**already accumulated** in the atmosphere]{.underline}. Then, those
emissions would be [locked away in some kind of **permanent storage,
generally in underground geologic formations**, so they don\'t escape to
create more warming down the road]{.underline}. But despite carbon
dioxide\'s power to heat the planet, it\'s very diffuse, making up less
than 1% of the atmosphere. That makes it tricky to capture from the air
in large quantities.

Option 1: Use nature to absorb carbon emissions

Nature is the most powerful carbon sponge around us. Plants take up
carbon dioxide through the process of photosynthesis, locking it away in
their tissues, making the world\'s forests, grasslands, soils and
wetlands huge reservoirs of carbon. Building up these natural reserves
could help slow warming, whether through planting forests, restoring
wetlands and mangroves or encouraging agricultural practices that store
carbon in the soil. This method is by far the cheapest so far. However,
those ecosystems must be protected from development. If the plants and
ecosystem are lost, the carbon escapes back into the atmosphere.

Option 2: Use leftover plants to make energy and capture the emissions

Plants are already used to make electricity in biomass power plants,
which means that while that plant material trapped carbon, the carbon is
released in the process of generating energy. A handful of biomass power
plants are working on capturing those carbon emissions and then storing
them in underground geologic formations. It\'s known as \"bioenergy with
carbon capture and storage.\"

The biomass used is often leftover material, like waste from
agricultural crops, forest harvests or food waste, or it can come from
crops grown specifically for that purpose. This strategy has the added
benefit of producing electricity at the same time. But scaling it up
could require more land, putting pressure on wild ecosystems that also
store carbon and provide habitat for wildlife. It would take an
estimated 115,000 to 166,000 square miles of land, as large as
California, to grow the biomass needed to pull 1 billion tons of carbon
dioxide out of the air.

Option 3: [Pull it out of the air with **big machines**]{.underline}

Last year, the [largest carbon removal project of its kind started up in
Iceland]{.underline}. The Orca plant, run by the Swiss company
Climeworks, is [essentially a carbon vacuum. Fans pull in air, the
**carbon is captured by a special material** and then it\'s pumped
underground into geologic formations where it mineralizes, remaining
trapped.]{.underline}

Other \"direct air capture\" plants, as they\'re known, are in
development in the U.S. But most are still pilot projects. The
technology is expensive and requires a lot of energy. One analysis shows
that capturing a ton of carbon this way takes almost as much energy as
burning 100 gallons of gasoline, which produces a ton of carbon. If the
energy used isn\'t renewable, it would add more heat-trapping gases to
the atmosphere.

## AT: AI CP

### AT: AI CP\-\--American AI Initiative

#### CP can't solve --- 7 problems with the American AI Initiative. 

**Schwab 19** --- Katharine Schwab, Deputy editor of fast company's
technology section, 2019 ("7 problems with Trump's 'American AI'
Initiative," *Fast Company*, February 12^th^, Available Online at
<https://www.fastcompany.com/90305421/7-problems-with-trumps-american-ai-initiative>,
Accessed 07-23-2022)

[MORE RESOURCES FOR AI PROJECTS COULD BE GOOD--BUT ONLY IF IT'S DONE IN
A RESPONSIBLE WAY]{.underline}

[One element of Trump's initiative calls for federal agencies to open up
federal data, algorithms, and computing power to AI experts in industry
and academia.]{.underline}

For Janelle Shane, research scientist and creator of the AI Weirdness
blog, that could be a good thing. "[[Giving researchers more
resources?]{.mark} That['s a nice thing]{.mark} especially [if it gets
released to students working in the area]{.mark}, or people who have a
smallish project they want to try," she commented. "I've seen a lot of
people, hobbyists, artists, or students who have projects they want to
do and they can only make some progress because they don't have the
computing power, or they sign up for cloud computing service, and didn't
realize how expensive it is."]{.underline}

But for Nikki Stevens, a researcher at Arizona State University who
studies software engineering ethics, opening up datasets for use can
have negative consequences.

"[[I'm concerned about giving researchers access to federal datasets and
algorithms]{.mark},"]{.underline} she says. "We know that datasets and
algorithms can be biased, so [[offering these up]{.mark} uncritically
for AI research will [perpetuate]{.mark} that
[bias]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[[ETHICAL STANDARDS ARE AN EMPTY GESTURE]{.underline}]{.mark}

A key element of Trump's proposal includes setting technical standards
for AI development and use to ensure that the technology is "reliable,
robust, trustworthy, secure, portable, and interoperable." [While the
executive order doesn't use the word ethics specifically, [standards
that ensure the trustworthiness and security of technology are clearly
related to and influenced by ethical
considerations]{.mark}.]{.underline} But as Stevens says, that doesn't
mean much:

"[[The inclusion of ethical standards]{.mark} as a main priority
[is]{.mark} an [important]{.mark}, [but empty]{.mark},
gesture]{.underline}. Government bodies that have a history of disregard
for citizens' rights are not the best choice for drafting ethical codes.
I would look for this initiative to include a racially diverse group of
academics, religious, and community leaders. [I would especially hope
that the administration would include members of groups that are most
impacted by unjust AI: African American, Indigenous, disabled, and
immigrant communities.]{.underline}

Instead, Morgan Klaus Scheuerman, a researcher at University of Colorado
Boulder who studies gender recognition algorithms, believes that the
government should work toward actual policies to hold agencies
accountable for their AI development, not just technical guidelines:

[[The current proposed guidelines]{.mark} of
[reliable]{.mark}]{.underline}, robust, trustworthy, secure, portable,
and interoperable AI systems certainly address some of the expected
functionality of AI systems, [but concretely legislating the way these
systems can be used against citizens should also be a priority for
policymakers. [We should also be focused on the social and ethical
standards]{.mark} we expect from research and development.]{.underline}
Right now, academic researchers are self-regulating by following a still
rather fuzzy set of guidelines in the FAT (Fairness, Accountability,
Transparency) Framework. However, these are very hard to implement in
practice, and the standards for implementation vary wildly. Thus, I hope
setting AI governance standards includes the creation of legal policies,
not just technical standards.

[[ITS APPROACH TO AI ETHICS IS ALL WRONG]{.underline}]{.mark}

Another element of the technical standard proposal is "Setting AI
Governance Standards," including "Federal agencies will foster public
trust in AI systems by establishing guidance for AI development and use
across different types of technology and industrial sectors." In the
same section, the order states that the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST), a government agency, will "lead the development
of appropriate technical standards for reliable, robust, trustworthy,
secure, portable, and interoperable AI systems."

But for Os Keyes, University of Washington researcher who focuses on the
impact of data science and AI on trans people, that's a big problem:

"[[For an organization to produce ethical guidelines]{.mark} or ethical
regulations, [it needs]{.mark} two things: first [expertise]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} second, a degree of [independence and power]{.mark} from
organizations that have their own interests in what algorithmic systems
that they're allowed to make. In terms of ethics expertise,
[NIST]{.mark} really [doesn't have any]{.mark}. They've been engaged in
\[testing and evaluating\] AI systems, like facial recognition, for
literally decades. But their work rarely considers the ethical
considerations of what's being done. I've never seen any indication they
have ethicists on staff or any indication they intend to have
one.]{.underline}

"NIST isn't independent.... They're funded \[in part\] by the FBI.
[[NIST]{.mark} [is]{.mark}n't just a government standards
organization--it's [part of the Department of Commerce]{.mark}. Its job
is to create standards with an eye to how they can enable the American
free market and U.S. companies to flourish.]{.underline}

"So [in the case of AI, what [people are worried about]{.mark} is [two
things]{.mark}: the first is that [it will enable an authoritarian
government dystopia, and]{.mark} the second is it [will enable a
corporate surveillance and monetization dystopia]{.mark}. To give the
job of preventing those things to NIST is to give it to an organization
which takes funding from government law enforcement agencies that
promote control and authoritarianism, and an organization whose remit is
to promote and boost the degree to which monetization happens and to
which corporate entities and private sector concerns play a role in
American society.]{.underline}

"I think the result is going to be something that won't constrain
government from doing whatever it wants... and it's not going to
constrain other entities from doing whatever they want."

After this story was published, NIST clarified that it "collaborates
with other agencies and receives some funding from them for specific
programs and projects but is independent of those agencies." The
executive order explicitly charges NIST with working on technical
standards and not matters of ethics or morality. Of course, the way AI
works technically is fundamentally tied to questions of ethics, given
that these algorithms often use biased datasets.

[[WHO DETERMINES WHAT]{.mark} [AMERICA'S "VALUES AND INTERESTS"
ARE]{.mark}?]{.underline}

[Trump's plan also advances the idea that AI research should be a global
project, with different countries cooperating to advance the good of
everyone.]{.underline} But there's a caveat: The initiative's
announcement states that the president is open to this international
cooperation so long as development is "consistent with our Nation's
values and interests." For Shane, that raises a serious question:

"There's already tension now between AI researchers in industry or
academia working on projects that may or may not be used for defense, or
surveillance, or used to target civilians with drones from above. When
we see things about American values and interests, under 'international
outreach,' the concern is: [[Who gets to determine what those
are]{.mark}? [Will it be done in away that represents all
Americans]{.mark}, and not just some subset of them? [Will it be done in
a way that researchers will be happy]{.mark} to work on these problems
and won't be conflicted about how their research might be
used?"]{.underline}

[[WE SHOULDN'T APPROACH]{.mark} AUTOMATION [WITH
FEAR]{.mark}]{.underline}

Another element of Trump's American AI Initiative tackles retraining the
U.S. population as jobs are automated. But Stevens points out that the
way Trump frames his solution--educational programs and training
sessions--is ultimately harmful:

"[The approach to \[automation\] is fear-based. [Framing AI as a
technology that will take people's jobs is a disempowering and
deterministic narrative.]{.mark} As \[the government\] moves to
operationalize this, they have the freedom to position this instead as
'how do we limit AI to protect citizen jobs' rather than assuming that
vast swaths of the working population will be displaced."]{.underline}

[[JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING CAN BE AUTOMATED DOESN'T MEAN IT SHOULD
BE]{.underline}]{.mark}

The last element of the initiative states that federal agencies will
prioritize investment into AI technologies in their R&D budgets. But
Keyes sees this directive as ultimately detrimental:

["It worries me to hear the federal government, which controls housing,
medical care for a large number of Native Americans, law enforcement
regulation, and boring stuff like highway standards, but also important
stuff like Social Security payments, say that their priority in this
kind of research is removing human factors and humanity from how
decisions are made.]{.underline}

"[[You're going to get a replication of a lot of the ethical issues
we've seen with AI,]{.mark} and you're going to get this attitude that
if something exists or could be replaced with an algorithm, that means
that it should be. That's dangerous to me because, amongst other things,
that's often not the case. And [it's something where doing it leads to
terrifying errors]{.mark}.]{.underline}

["If you say that Housing and Human Services should have its budget
prioritize AI investments, they \[could\] come up with an algorithm to
determine where houses should be built or who should get houses that
replaces human beings. You get two problems: the factors that this
algorithm can factor in are fundamentally things that can be quantified,
which will constrain and change how those decisions are made. And the
second thing is that we're told \[AI is\] so much faster, it can make a
million decisions in an hour. But even if it's only wrong 1% of the
time, with a million decisions, [that's 10k errors that need to be
appealed somewhere and addressed and handled.]{.mark}"]{.underline}

[[IMMIGRATION HAS TO BE PART OF THE AI CONVERSATION]{.underline}]{.mark}

Finally, [[one of the biggest problems]{.mark} [with the American AI
Initiative is what it doesn't address]{.mark}.]{.underline} For Shane,
keeping America at the cutting edge of AI is dependent on immigration
policy, and convincing the world's brightest minds to come and stay in
the country:

"[If you talk to people who are actually in the field doing this
research, [one of the major things they say is that the U.S. needs to do
better on immigration policies and not make things so miserable to come
over here and study, or stay here and work]{.mark}. In recent years our
immigration policies have become so hostile to these students, it's
turning people away from studying in the U.S. or coming to the U.S. for
conferences. Conferences moving to different countries. [This executive
order doesn't address that.]{.mark} [It]{.mark}'s not surprising but
that [would be an essential part]{.mark} of any meaningful move [to make
the U.S. more of a leader in AI]{.mark} or in any science
area."]{.underline}

across different types of technology and industrial sectors." In the

### AT: AI CP\-\--R&D Spending

#### Increasing R&D in all aspects is bad. 

**Heney 20** --- Paul Heney, writer for R&D world, 2020 ("Current R&D
challenges," *R&D World*, May 1^st^, Available Online at
<https://www.rdworldonline.com/current-rd-challenges/>, Accessed
07-23-2022)

[[Technology growth in the R&D]{.mark} environment [appears to be
continuous]{.mark} and without much letup or increase in the rate of
change.]{.underline} According to the respondents to R&D World
magazine's 2020 Global R&D Funding Forecast reader survey, performed in
September 2019, most researchers have seen significant technology
changes over the past year (September 2018 to September 2019). 89% of
the survey respondents experienced technology growth in their industry,
while only 6% saw a slowdown in their industry's technology growth. The
rate of technology change is likely accelerating, but the acceleration
rate is remaining close to the same each year we collect data for our
R&D Funding Forecasts.

To collect data on the trends in R&D performance for this report, the
editors of R&D World magazine create and deploy annual electronic reader
surveys. Responses for last year's 2019 R&D Funding Forecast resembled
survey results collected for this report --- within 1% of each other. To
create these reports, three surveys are deployed annually, generally
with about two to three weeks separating them. Each survey has about
twenty distinctive questions. For the 2020 Funding Forecast, the editors
received more than 2,100 responses, which is definitely statistically
significant, and the results are considered reliable.

A review of the responses from R&D World magazine's reader surveys
reveals respondents' over-riding concerns with costs. Operating costs,
capital costs, materials costs, production costs, staffing costs --- but
always costs. [It is clear that reliable cost prediction and reduction
are both important. [If an R&D project is late, costs will be larger as
well]{.mark}.]{.underline}

A classic, but extreme, example concerns one of the largest R&D projects
ever created --- the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) being developed
by NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency
(CSA). Originally designed as the Next Generation Space Telescope in
1996 and as a replacement for the NASA/ESA developed Hubble Space
Telescope, the JWST was originally scheduled to launch in 2007. JWST is
billed as one of the most technically complex satellites ever and will
be situated at the Earth's Lagrangian point (L2) 1.5 million miles from
its surface. Following 14 years of multiple technical delays, the
telescope now is scheduled to launch in March 2021 following a 2018
official project review. It's estimated final cost is now close to \$10
billion, 25 times more than its original estimate.

[Other R&D challenges brought out by R&D World magazine's surveys
include: [funding sources, the rapid pace of technological change, new
technologies and sociological issues, technical staffing shortages,
aging infrastructures, inflation and its effects on increasing costs,
global competition, economic disruptions and corporate pressures to
improve performance]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[R[&D managers say it is more difficult to find skilled]{.mark} R&D
[staff]{.mark} than it was even 12 months ago]{.underline}. In 2019,
about 65% of survey respondents found it difficult to find skilled R&D
staff. In 2020, that figure has risen to 71%. Part of the issue is that
the overall U.S. unemployment rate in August 2018 was 3.9%. In August
2019, when the latest Funding Forecast survey deployed, the unemployment
rate had dropped to 3.5%, where it still remains and is forecast to
continue for the foreseeable future.

Part of the staffing shortage relief in the past for R&D managers was
the ability to hire skilled immigrants. MS and PhD-qualified personnel
could be hired on as interns in many high-technology positions,
especially in U.S. government labs. That option has been diminished on
several fronts, as immigration laws have become more restrictive,
especially for selective countries in the Middle East and South East
Asia.

And while the rules are increasingly restrictive on who can enter the
U.S., the actual process for those immigrants has become more complex
and time-consuming. The overall approval process has lengthened from
several months to now often more than a year. The complexity of it all
discourages potential immigrants, some of whom decide not to pursue a
position in the U.S. and either apply to enter another country or just
stay where they are.

In particular, many Asian students studying in U.S. universities have
historically found positions within the U.S. This scenario has also
changed. Many now retrun to their homeland following graduation where
they are well received. Additionally, foreign students increasingly find
that their own country's academic institutions have improved
substantially over the past five to ten years to a point where they are
now competitive with U.S. academic institutions. And there are jobs for
them at home when they finish.

Chinese academia is also actively recruiting professor-level teachers
and researchers from U.S. academic institutions along with substantial
incentives to move. In China, these U.S. professionals can teach,
perform research (with much less work to get funded than in the U.S.)
and become more and faster recognized for their scientific
accomplishments.

Net, [[U.S. R&D]{.mark} managers have an increasingly smaller skilled
R&D worker pool to draw from than they have in the past. The
[forecast]{.mark} also [is not dramatically positive]{.mark} for the
foreseeable future.]{.underline}

These statistical trends also show up in the expectations that U.S.
research managers see in their immediate R&D plans. The overall U.S.
economy has been surprisingly strong for more than 10 years and is
expected to continue expanding into 2020. This expansion contrasts with
the rest of the world where economic growth is slowing and even
stalling. China's automotive sector, for example, has shrunk over the
past six months with some Chinese companies, including automotive
dealerships, now threatened with closure because of reduced demand.
Foreign automotive companies in China, such as General Motors and Ford
Motor Co., are not immune to these events and their sales as well have
declined.

The continuing U.S.-China trade disputes throughout 2019 has only
exacerbated this situation with little "light seen at the end of the
tunnel." And a smaller or shrinking economy also has the effect of
smaller or shrinking R&D budgets as well.

Nevertheless, with a growing U.S. economy and despite the specter of a
shrinking U.S. job force, R&D managers continue to be optimistic. They
expect to grow their R&D staffs in 2020. In 2019, about 45% of the
survey respondents expected to add personnel while 10% expected to make
cuts. But 50% of R&D managers now expect to increase their R&D staffs in
2020 while less than 8% expect to cut them.

One of the 2020 Global R&D Funding Forecast survey questions queried
researchers about the difficulty of creating a 2020 R&D budget. Some 52%
of the respondents said budgeting was more difficult in 2020 than in
2017. Only 13% of respondents felt budgeting was easier now than three
years ago. We found the same sentiment in responses submitted in last
year's (2019) R&D Funding Forecast.

[[The factors making R&D budgets more difficult]{.mark} to create than
in the past [include]{.mark} accounting for expected R&D [staffing
shortages w]{.mark}hich, as noted earlier, is likely to be slightly more
severe in 2020 than it was in 2019. Continuing [high tech]{.mark}nology
[advances]{.mark} also complicate the creation of budgets. Artificial
intelligence technologies continue to be more complex, as do [autonomous
implementations]{.mark}. This is especially true in the automotive
industry and in other transportation modes, include aircraft. Autonomous
aircraft, however, are even further down the road than driverless
automotive and trucking systems. Interestingly, there has been no
discussion of AI-assisted R&D budget creation in the literature but
likely could be a future topic.]{.underline}

[[Further complicating]{.mark} the creation of R&D budgets for 2020 [is
the continuing slowdown of the overall global
economy]{.mark}.]{.underline} The International Monetary Fund's (IMF's)
October global economic forecast pegs the U.S. economy to grow by about
2.2%, slower than 2018's 2.5% growth. This deacceleration creates more
caution in committing to numerous R&D investments.

[[The commercial antibody market is already a mess]{.mark}, although
that\'s not a new development,]{.underline} but it\'s gotten messier.
[[Santa Cruz Biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}, one of the big suppliers, is
getting out of a big part of the business. Actually, [\"being forced out
of the business through their own actions]{.underline}\" is probably a
better description. [The company [has been hit with a \$3.5 million
dollar fine over its treatment]{.mark} [of]{.mark} its [goats and
rabbits]{.mark}, and has to give up its license [under the Animal
Welfare Act]{.mark}.]{.underline} That means they can continue with
mice, rats, and chickens, but the rabbit and goat antibody production is
now shut down.

[The USDA had found evidence of mistreatment at the company\'s
facilities in California]{.underline}, and (in a bizarre development)
also found an entire goat facility that the company had not been
reporting. The current settlement includes the \"neither admits nor
denies\" language about the company\'s culpability, but you don\'t give
up a big piece of your business and agree to the largest animal-welfare
fine in USDA history if you think you have a good case. [You also don\'t
suddenly cause 4,000 animals to vanish right before an inspection, which
is what apparently happened a few months ago]{.underline}

[Using animals in biopharma research is still unavoidable (go find
another way to make antibodies, for example). It\'s true that monoclonal
antibodies are produced in cell culture, but that process still begins
by injecting a mouse.]{.underline} Meanwhile, polyclonal antibodies, of
the sort that Santa Cruz was producing, use animals directly for
production. You inject a mouse, or a rabbit, or a goat (or what have
you) with your antigen of choice, let their immune system reaction to
it, and draw blood to harvest the resulting antibodies. Animal care and
use committees come in because all of these steps can be run humanely,
or not so humanely. In addition to basic standards for keeping lab
animals, there are regulations about how strongly you can challenge
their immune systems, how often you can draw blood (and how much), and
so on, and Santa Cruz appears to have been accused of violations up and
down the list.

[[As human beings, **we have a responsibility to treat our research
animals as befits a species** that can understand the consequences of
its own actions.]{.mark}]{.underline} Losing Santa Cruz Biotechnology\'s
rabbit and goat production is going to disrupt the work of a number of
research labs around the world, and not in that hot, happenin\' Silicon
Valley sense of the word. But it still sounds like a fair trade.
[[There\'s enough pain and suffering in this world already - creating
more of it just because you can\'t be bothered is not an acceptable way
for human beings to act, not towards animals and not towards other
humans.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### NATO action in the Baltics angers Russia\-\--Previous Western action proves

**Carpenter 22,** Ted Galen, senior fellow in defense and foreign policy
studies at the Cato Institute, is the author of 12 books on
international affairs, 2-28-2022, \"Many predicted Nato expansion would
lead to war. Those warnings were ignored,\"
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/28/nato-expansion-war-russia-ukraine>
//BigSasher

The following year, the [Kremlin demonstrated that its discontent with
Nato's continuing incursions into Russia's security zone had moved
beyond verbal objections]{.underline}. Moscow exploited a foolish
provocation by Georgia's pro‐​western government to launch a military
offensive that brought Russian troops to the outskirts of the capital.
Thereafter, Russia permanently detached two secessionist‐​minded Georgian
regions and put them under effective Russian control.

Western (especially [US) leaders continued to blow through red warning
light after a red warning light, however.]{.underline} The Obama
administration's shockingly arrogant meddling in Ukraine's internal
political affairs in 2013 and 2014 to help demonstrators [overthrow
Ukraine's elected, pro‐​Russia president was the single most brazen
provocation, and it caused tensions to spike. Moscow immediately
responded by seizing and annexing Crimea, and a new cold war was
underway with a vengeance]{.underline}.

Could the Ukraine crisis have been avoided?

Events during the past few months constituted the last chance to avoid a
hot war in eastern Europe. Putin demanded that Nato provide guarantees
on several security issues. Specifically, [the Kremlin wanted binding
assurances that the alliance would reduce the scope of its growing
military presence in eastern Europe and would never offer membership to
Ukraine. He backed up those demands with a massive military buildup on
Ukraine's borders.]{.underline}

The Biden administration's response to Russia's quest for meaningful
western concessions and security guarantees was tepid and evasive. Putin
then clearly decided to escalate matters. **[Washington's attempt to
make Ukraine a Nato political and military pawn]{.underline}** (even
absent the country's formal membership in the alliance) **[may end up
costing the Ukrainian people dearly.]{.underline}**

The Ukraine tragedy

History will show that Washington's treatment of Russia in the decades
following the demise of the Soviet Union was a policy blunder of epic
proportions. [It was entirely predictable that Nato expansion would
ultimately lead to a tragic, perhaps violent, breach of relations with
Moscow.]{.underline} Perceptive analysts warned of the likely
consequences, but those warnings went unheeded. We are now paying the
price for the US foreign policy establishment's myopia and arrogance.

//BigSasher

The [difficulties in the implementation of the BALTBAT project could
hardly be overestimated.]{.underline} The Baltic countries have set
themselves a task to create a military unit meeting the highest
international standards, while having at the same time to create their
military structures from scratch. [There was a **lack of practically
everything** except for the political will **among** the leadership of
the three **Baltic countries** and enthusiasm on the part of the three
fledgling defence establishments.]{.underline}

Of course, such problems as the [scarcity of resources and of the lack
of adequately trained military personnel in Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania]{.underline} were well known before the launch of the project.
It was only in the light of firm determination of the defence leadership
in the Baltic states and prospects for substantial support from a number
of Western countries that the task looked feasible. The problem, which
was clearly underestimated, was the fact that the [**implementation of
the BALTBAT** project was **affecti**ng a number of **institutions in
the Baltic** **s**tates beyond their military structures]{.underline}.
Those often were unready and sometimes unwilling to co-operate in such a
complex multinational project, especially as appropriate legal framework
was lacking. [So many things the Baltic states had to do for the first
time in their history]{.underline}. In particular, the [project
implementation]{.underline} was [often obstructed by lengthy procedures
for border crossings between the three Baltic countries, paper work
related to military transit, taxation of various training materials
designated for BALTBAT, cost-sharing arrangements, and
others]{.underline}. This was often causing frustration among the
supporting countries as well as the BALTBAT soldiers. And as the project
was of such a high political visibility, [information on all the
practical difficulties was immediately reaching the policy
level]{.underline} and was forcing the BALTBAT Steering Group and other
senior political bodies to get involved into micro management of the
project.

[Despite the overall positive attitude from NFP toward the role of the
Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011--2020 as a streamlining mechanism,
80% of survey respondents suggested there were opportunities to further
improve cooperation in implementing the biodiversity-related
conventions.]{.underline} [**Challenges impeding progress included** the
following: **location of NFPs for different conventions in different
government ministries and agencies, which reduces collaboration; lack of
cooperation mechanisms among NFPs and other key stakeholders involved in
the implementation of the conventions linked to regulatory barriers or
weak collaboration among state agencies; general lack of knowledge of
how to implement the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity and NBSAPs; and
insufficient resources for NFPs to fully address all their
responsibilities.**]{.underline} Respondents recognized that there are
limits to the degree that conventions can collaborate on all issues,
given the different mandates of the various conventions (e.g., to
conserve migratory species throughout their range \[CMS\] or to ensure
the conservation and wise use of wetlands \[Ramsar Convention\]).

[These challenges illustrate the simple fact that cross-convention
planning through the NBSAP process does not and cannot replace planning
processes for the implementation of conventions other than the CBD.
Instead, the engagement in the NBSAP process is added to the list of
responsibilities of NFPs from other biodiversity-related conventions.
**There is therefore the likelihood that the NBSAP process is perceived
as of lower priority than the obligations** directly **related to
objectives of each individual convention,** including the development of
convention-specific implementation strategies and plans.]{.underline}

[Limitations]{.underline}

[[We limited our simulations]{.mark} to quasi-identifiers that have been

information loss becomes unacceptably large as the number of
quasi-identifiers increases, even for small values of k. 103 Therefore,
had we used more quasi-identifiers, the information loss effects that we

[[There are other approaches that have been proposed for achieving
k-anonymity that we did not consider]{.mark}, for example, local
recoding]{.underline}. 104-107 With local recoding, observations may
have different and overlapping response intervals. For instance, one
observation may have an age of 27 recoded to the interval 20--29, and
another observation may have an age of 27 recoded to the interval
25--35. [[This makes any data analysis of the k-anonymized data set more
complex]{.mark} than having the same recoding intervals for all
observations, and precludes the use of common and generally accepted
statistical modeling techniques]{.underline}. Our implementation of
k-anonymity used global recoding instead, and this ensures that response
intervals are the same across all observations.

Vaccines Against Everything?," *New York Times*, November 19^th^,

[[Vaccines are among the most ingenious of inventions, and among the
most maddening]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Some global killers, like smallpox and polio, have been totally or
nearly eradicated by products made with methods dating back to Louis
Pasteur. Others, like malaria and H.I.V., utterly frustrate scientists
to this day, despite astonishing new weapons like gene-editing.

[We have a vaccine for Ebola that protects nearly 100 percent of its
recipients, but we are lucky to get a routine flu shot that works half
that well]{.underline}.

We have children's vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria,
whooping cough, tetanus, chickenpox, polio, hepatitis A and B,
rotavirus, pneumococcus, haemophilus influenzae and meningococcal
disease.

They have changed our expectations of mortality --- and of parenthood.
In 17th century England, one-third of all children died before age 15.
Today, thanks largely to those vaccines, less than 1 percent of English
children do.

In tropical countries, there are vaccines against yellow fever, cholera,
Japanese encephalitis, meningitis A, typhoid, dengue and rabies. But
there is still --- despite 30 years of effort --- no AIDS vaccine.

[[There is no universal flu vaccine]{.mark}. There are no vaccines with
long-lasting protection against malaria or tuberculosis.]{.underline}

None for parasites like Chagas, elephantiasis, hookworm or liver flukes.
None for some viral threats that could become pandemic, like Nipah,
Lassa and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.

None for some that already have, including Lyme, West Nile, Zika and
hepatitis C.

None for respiratory syncytial virus, which kills infants, nor even for
the dozens of causes of common colds.

A Taste for Cannibalism?

[Vaccines are among the world's greatest medical advances, like clean
water, soap, bleach, sewage systems and antibiotics. In a rational world
--- one where budgets are built on lives saved per dollar --- spending
on vaccine research would rival that on defense research.]{.underline}

And progress would be as rapid. When Louis Pasteur was born, soldiers
carried muskets. Now, a Taliban fighter can be killed by a drone flown
from a base in Arizona, but vulnerable Americans still have to rely on a
flu-shot technology invented in 1931: growing vaccine in chicken eggs.

And as with weaponry, fear changes everything. In epidemiologically
quiet times, the anti-vaccine lobby sows doubts; when Ebola or pandemic
flu strikes, Americans clamor for protection.

[**[There are two obstacles to faster progress]{.mark}**, said Dr.
Gregory A. Poland, director of the vaccine research group at the Mayo
Clinic. **["One is scientific, and one is embarrassing]{.mark}**," he
said.]{.underline}

[The embarrassing part is the lack of investment. [It takes 10 years and
more than \$1 billion to develop a vaccine]{.mark} --- a small fortune
for a medical advance but a pittance for a weapons system.]{.underline}

While defense research is driven by one mega-customer, the Pentagon,
vaccine researchers face a confusing hodgepodge of potential backers.

[[Private industry largely pursues high-priced vaccines]{.mark} for
American children, militaries and adventure tourists. Potential
bioweapons like anthrax, plague and rabbit fever attract bioterrorism
funds.]{.underline}

[But vaccines meant to protect only poor people in faraway countries
usually must wait for donor governments and philanthropies like the Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, even though we know
these plagues cross borders.]{.underline}

11 Things We'd Really Like to Know

And a few we'd rather not discuss

The scientific obstacles, though more intractable, are relatively rare.

[**[Many pathogens are genetically farther apart]{.mark}** than
rhinoceroses and bees: A defense against a horn does not protect against
a sting, and vice versa.]{.underline}

[Most vaccines work by creating antibodies --- Y-shaped proteins ---
that block the disease agent's own proteins.]{.underline}

[While viruses have only handful of target proteins, bacteria have up to
6,000 and parasites even more, noted Dr. Paul A. Offit, director of
vaccine education at the Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia.]{.underline}

And even some smallish viruses, including H.I.V., flu and hepatitis C,
mutate so rapidly that their surfaces change shape before antibodies can
lock onto them.

As a rule, if a disease normally leaves even a few survivors who are
completely disease-free and immune for life, a vaccine against that
disease is possible. "Natural infection is the mother of all vaccines,"
said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases.

Smallpox meets the criteria; H.I.V., malaria and tuberculosis do not.
H.I.V. mutates as fast in one day as flu does in a year; it also
survives by splicing its DNA into the very immune cells that hunt it.

TB bacteria can survive even when "walled in" by white blood cells.

And malaria, a shape-shifting parasite, never triggers lifetime
immunity. People who survive repeated bouts get less sick each time, but
that immunity disappears if they move out of the malarial region. If
they return, the first mosquito bite may kill them.

Other diseases are complex, with many subtypes. For example, Pneumovax
23, the anti-pneumonia shot given to middle-aged people, negates 23
strains of one bacterium.

Nonetheless, many diseases now rampaging at large are relatively easy
targets, according to interviews with half a dozen experts. They could
be beaten with vaccines if the world committed more money.

Lengthy testing, though expensive, is crucial. Vaccines can have
dangerous hidden flaws. A 2007 H.I.V. vaccine candidate appeared to
increase infection risk among some gay men, though it remains unclear
why.

Earlier this year, the use of a new dengue vaccine was restricted to
people who had earlier dengue infections because it may have triggered
worse outcomes in some people who got dengue after receiving the
vaccine.

The relatively easy targets, experts said, include M.E.R.S., Nipah,
Lassa, respiratory syncytial virus, Lyme disease, West Nile, Zika and
the bacteria that cause strep throat and heart disease.

The first three, not coincidentally, are the first targets of the
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which was launched with
\$500 million at last year's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

Thus far, the coalition has raised about \$630 million, but its
ambitious plans --- including DNA and RNA platforms that will cut
vaccine-making time to weeks instead of months --- will require billions
of dollars.

Recent advances in a new tuberculosis vaccine and a new use for an old
one have encouraged experts.

"If you'd asked me 18 months ago whether a TB vaccine was possible, I'd
have said no," said Dr. Penny Heaton, chief executive officer of the new
Bill and Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute. "But I think the
field is now very promising."

A Lyme vaccine was licensed in 1998 but withdrawn four years later in
what has been called "a public health fiasco" after rumors, lawsuits and
alarmist media reports scared off customers. Now, with Lyme infecting an
estimated 300,000 Americans a year, an improved vaccine is in the works.

Dr. Peter J. Hotez, director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for
Vaccine Development, has vaccines against hookworm and schistosomiasis,
a waterborne liver fluke, in clinical trials and is working on eight
others.

Some candidate vaccines rely on startling mechanisms for defeating the
dizzyingly complex parasites --- including injecting humans with a gene
that produces an antibody that destroys a worm's gut when it sucks
blood.

But, like all the other projects in the works, that one needs more money
--- and not just from the usual suspects (the United States, Britain and
the Gates Foundation).

["[In this multi-trillion-dollar economy]{.mark}," Dr. Hotez said,
"**[it's a little discouraging that we can't raise the
funding]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

#### Backfires

Ben **Wolfgang 20,** covers the Pentagon, military and foreign affairs
for The Washington Times, \'Hotline\' between U.S., China feared as
strategic attack tool, AP NEWS, 8-5-2020,
https://apnews.com/article/foreign-policy-china-archive-mark-esper-cold-war-7a6aac96de971f69f1e41099ab132b88/shppp

In 21st century conflict, [even the crisis hotline could become a
**weapon of war**.]{.underline}

There are [**growing fears** among foreign policy
specialists]{.underline} and military and intelligence officials that
[any new crisis communication systems with China updated]{.underline},
[tactical-level versions of the cliched "red phone"]{.underline} between
Washington and Moscow at the height of the Cold War could themselves
[become **strategic tools of attack or deception.**]{.underline}

While the U.S. already has a nuclear hotline with China, along with a
so-called "space hotline" to avoid satellite collisions or other
catastrophes in orbit, the Pentagon over the past two decades has made a
concerted effort to beef up regular military-to-military communications
with the People's Liberation Army (PLA).

U.S. officials in the Pacific, military sources said, routinely hold
video calls with their Chinese counterparts, and Defense Secretary Mark
Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark A. Milley have made
it a priority to develop rapport with top officers in Beijing even as
much of the Trump administration is pressing a more hawkish line with
Beijing.

At the same time, there's been a growing push for more direct, immediate
communication avenues that could prove vital in a potential crisis
between the two nuclear superpowers. The possibility of such a crisis,
miscalculation or inadvertent encounter came into sharp focus over the
Fourth of July weekend when both militaries held major naval drills in
the same region of the South China Sea.

But [military insiders caution that seemingly helpful communication
mechanisms may introduce an **entirely new danger** to already tense
situations and]{.underline}, in certain scenarios, [could actually
**represent a threat** to U.S. security.]{.underline}

"There are those within the government who have long advocated for
establishing communications channels with the PLA at the operational
levels of command, in the belief this would help avert a conflict,
especially for cases of accidents at sea or in the air," retired Navy
Capt. James Fanell, [former director of intelligence for the
U.S.]{.underline} Pacific Fleet, [told The Washington Times. "I am **not
sure how effective** such a communications channel would be, as
\[China\] may try and make us dependent upon such a protocol but then in
the **midst of a crisis fail** to answer the other end of the
line."]{.underline}

Indeed, specialists warn and military sources acknowledge that if such
avenues were put in place, Beijing could potentially exploit them during
an offensive in the South China Sea or some other hostile act. If U.S.
officials expect to be able to reach their Chinese counterparts during
the crucial early moments of a military confrontation, analysts warn,
[Washington could lose precious minutes frantically to reach PLA leaders
who have **no intention of responding**.]{.underline}

Even more ominously, [there's mounting evidence that]{.underline} the
**[Chinese]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[Russian]{.underline}**
[militaries may be capable of quite literally **faking** their way
through a crisis hotline call,]{.underline} perhaps giving the Pentagon
a false sense of security [and **preserving** the element of
surprise]{.underline}.

"I think we need more than hotlines. \... In the era of hacking,
spoofing and soon deep fakes, hearing somebody on the other side of the
call give you happy talk won't necessarily resolve a crisis anyway,"
said Michael O'Hanlon, senior fellow and director of research in foreign
policy at the Brookings Institution.

Hotlines "can really only be effective in many cases if the two parties
to a call have developed some kind of potentially begrudging respect of
each other," he continued. "Otherwise, hotlines can just be vehicles for
propaganda and deception, and do nothing to resolve a crisis. They could
even contribute to intensifying it."

A last resort

In most instances, the term "hotline" refers not to a physical landline
but to communications at the highest levels of government or the
military including conversations between heads of state. The U.S. and
the Soviet Union, for example, set up a direct hotline in the aftermath
of 1962′s Cuban Missile Crisis.

The U.S. employed that channel to talk to the Kremlin immediately after
the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy, and the channel was
subsequently used by numerous presidents, according to data compiled by
the Arms Control Association.

Today, [Russia and China have their own bilateral nuclear
hotline]{.underline}, as do India and Pakistan. [North
Korea]{.underline} and South Korea also have their own channel for use
during military emergencies, though [Pyongyang reportedly has **often
gone dark** and stopped responding to calls during tense
moments]{.underline}. India and China earlier this year resolved
previous disagreements and agreed to set up their own military hotline,
though it's unclear if it was of any benefit during recent border
standoffs between the two nations.

Outside of the nuclear hotline, the U.S. has regular military
communications with Russia, particularly in places such as Syria, where
both nations have an active troop presence. The Pentagon has said it
employs regular "deconfliction" protocols there to ensure there are no
accidents or miscalculations.

Since the Clinton administration, the U.S. has had its own direct
nuclear hotline with Beijing, to be used in the event of a major crisis.

But such high-level communications aren't the proper avenue to discuss
specific military exercises or potential confrontations. In those
circumstances, the responsibility falls to the Pentagon and its
commanders in the field to build on groundwork laid by American
diplomats.

Defense Department officials told The Times that both the U.S. and China
helped develop the "Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea," a set of
rules and procedures designed to help prevent an escalation of tensions
between navies. The two nations also have signed formal rules on air
safety and maritime encounters, setting up common terms and references
for both countries to employ in an incident.

As part of the 1998 Military Maritime Consultative Agreement, U.S. and
Chinese officials meet twice a year "to discuss how to develop maritime
and aviation safety and professionalism" and to review any incidents
over the past year, Pentagon officials said.

But it's less clear exactly how direct communication between the two
militaries would play out in a real-world crisis and whether that
communication would be enough to halt escalation.

In 2009, for example, the USS Impeccable was shadowed by five Chinese
vessels during a mission in the South China Sea. Military sources
familiar with that incident told The Times it took a complex series of
phone calls from U.S. Command in the Pacific to the American Embassy in
Beijing, then to the Chinese Foreign Ministry and ultimately the PLA
before the situation was resolved.

In other instances, Chinese military officials have failed to properly
warn the U.S. and other nations of military exercises in proximity to
their ships, such as a 2013 incident in which the USS Cowpens nearly
collided with Chinese warships. In extreme scenarios where death or
destruction appears imminent, officials said, the navies can hail one
another on international frequencies.

Moving forward, specialists say it's more important than ever that
military leaders establish fully functional lines of communication
especially given the strained state of relations between Washington and
Beijing. Over just the past several weeks, the countries have closed
consulates and expelled journalists in a diplomatic tit-for-tat that has
ratcheted up tensions and sparked fears of conflict.

"The [proper operation of hotlines and other crisis management
mechanisms **are needed** most when bilateral relations are]{.underline}
poor [and, therefore, the chances of **misperceptions** and **conflict
escalation** are high]{.underline}," said Patricia M. Kim, a senior
policy analyst with the China Program at the U.S. Institute of Peace.

#### Education is being decked now\-\--no chance for reform

**Berkshire and Schneider 22,** Jennifer C. and Jack, 3-21-2022, Ms.
Berkshire, a journalist, and Mr. Schneider, a professor at the
University of Massachusetts Lowell, have written extensively about
public education. \"If You Think Republicans Are Overplaying Schools,
You Aren't Paying Attention,\" NY Times,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/opinion/democrats-public-education-culture-wars.html>
//BigSasher

Today, as the middle class falls further behind the wealthy, the belief
in education as the sole remedy for economic inequality appears more and
more misguided. And yet, because Democrats have spent the past 30 years
framing schooling as the surest route to the good life, [any **attempt
to make our education system fairer** is **met with** fierce
**resistance** from affluent liberals **worried that Democratic reforms
might threaten their carefully laid plans to help their children get
ahead.**]{.underline}

In California, [plans to place less emphasis on calculus in an effort to
address persistent racial and socioeconomic disparities in math
achievement have spawned furious backlash.]{.underline} [So, too, did
the announcement]{.underline} last fall that New York City [schools
would be winding down their gifted and talented program, which has been
widely criticized for exacerbating segregation]{.underline} --- an
announcement that Mayor Eric Adams has begun to walk back.

Mr. Youngkin was one of the first to recognize that these anxieties
could be used for political gain, and he carefully tailored his
messaging to parents from both affluent families and the conservative
movement. In his appeals to the Republican base, he railed against
critical race theory and claimed that allies of George Soros had
inserted "operatives" on local school boards. To centrist parents, he
pledged to undo admissions policy changes aimed at bolstering diversity
at Virginia's prestigious Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and
Technology, where graduates regularly go on to attend Ivy League
universities.

These promises seem to have worked. A recent focus group conducted by a
Democratic polling firm showed that education was the top issue cited by
Joe Biden supporters who had voted or considered voting for Mr.
Youngkin. [Participants referred to an array of complaints about
education, including a sense that the focus on race and social justice
in Virginia's schools had gone too far, eclipsing core academic
subjects]{.underline}. Similar charges echoed through the San Francisco
school board election last month as Asian American voters, furious over
changes to the admissions process at a highly selective high school,
galvanized a movement to oust three school board members.

#### Inflation is at a record high\-\--there's no hope for small businesses

**Rosenbaum 22,** Eric, 2-14-2022, Senior Editor and Reporter for CNBC,
"A new inflation reading shows the small business tipping point has been
reached," CNBC,
<https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/14/inflation-economic-shock-complete-as-main-street-tipping-point-reached.html>
//BigSasher

[Inflation has taken hold of Main Street, with an increasing number of
small business owners saying it will not relent over the next six months
and raising prices to offset increases in the costs of supplies,
according to the latest CNBC\|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey.
President Biden's approval rating is underwater, and though the small
business community skews conservative and the vast majority of liberals
surveyed continue to support Biden, support among Democrats ticked down
this quarter, and confidence in the Federal Reserve's ability to control
inflation is low. The overall CNBC\|SurveyMonkey Small Business
Confidence Index score continues to hover around all-time lows, though
it remained unchanged from Q4 2021.]{.underline} The latest Consumer
Price Index reading, the highest in four decades, isn't the only sign
that [[inflation is
extending]{.underline}](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/10/january-2022-cpi-inflation-rises-7point5percent-over-the-past-year-even-more-than-expected.html) rather
than giving up its hold over the U.S. economy in 2022. [An increasing
number of American small businesses say they are now passing on higher
costs to customers, or soon will be forced to make that decision. While
the 74% of small business owners who say they are experiencing rising
costs of supplies is virtually unchanged from Q4 2021, according to a
new CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey, the number of businesses
passing on costs to customers has risen to 47% in the first quarter, up
from 39% in Q4 2021.]{.underline} And another 32% indicate they will
have to raise prices soon if inflation persists. Sticky inflation is
their expectation. Over eighty percent of small business owners expect
inflation to still be a problem six months from now (55% say that is
"very likely"), according to the [[CNBC\|SurveyMonkey
data]{.underline}](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/cnbc-small-business-q1-2022/).
[The Main Street concerns about inflation are connected to the small
business outlook on the supply chain, with 75% saying these issues are
likely to be a problem six months from now]{.underline}. And there is a
lack of faith in policymakers, with [71% of small business owners not
confident in the Federal Reserve's ability to control
inflation]{.underline}. The CNBC/SurveyMonkey online poll was conducted
January 24-30, 2022 among a national sample of 2,227 self-identified
small business owners. "The underlying problem with inflation is that
there's no end in sight," said Laura Wronski, senior manager of research
science at [[Momentive]{.underline}](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MNTV),
which conducts the survey for CNBC. "We've become accustomed to rising
and falling Covid waves, and businesses have had the time to rewrite
their playbooks to accommodate. But **[no one knows how quickly or to
what degree inflation will continue to rise, so that unpredictability is
inducing some uneas]{.underline}e**," she said, with the lack of faith
in the Fed adding to the uncertainty. "[I don't think it is getting
better. It has gotten worse]{.underline}," said Michelle Pusateri, owner
of San Francisco-based Nana Joes Granola. Nana Joes Granola witnessed a
boom in business during Covid as demand for packaged goods skyrocketed,
but the business situation has flipped, with the hyper-growth from
earlier in the pandemic now overwhelmed by supply chain and pricing
issues and its profit margins being squeezed. Nana Joes Granola stocked
up on ingredients and bought them at higher volumes to get lower pricing
as demand outstripped supply and logistics issues worsened. The loading
up on inventory is "more of a stopgap right now," Pusateri said, but she
expects it will probably become a long-term business issue. Her firm
held \$94,000 of inventory at the end of 2019, but by the end of last
year, that had risen to \$327,000. "I think more and more businesses
will have to sit on more inventory," Pusateri said. [In multiple ways,
small business owners have lost leverage with suppliers. Large buyers
are favored in transactions, and smaller buyers are no longer able to
order in smaller batches]{.underline} (e.g. half-pallets) or rely on
contract pricing. "Lots of ingredients are in high demand, meaning
farmers and vendors and brokers can name their price. They can wait
until the last highest bidder," said Pusateri, who is a member of the
Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices community. Among that Main
Street sample, 84% indicated in [[a recent
survey]{.underline}](https://www.goldmansachs.com/citizenship/10000-small-businesses/US/infographics/small-businesses-on-the-brink/index.html) that
inflation has gotten worse for them since September, and only 13% see
supply chain issues subsiding over the first half of 2022. Nana Joes
Granola's main ingredient, oats, has seen a huge spike in price, and
Pusateri does not expect any downward pricing pressure given the current
level of supply and demand. It's not just an increase in input costs,
but the magnitude of the increase which is walloping smaller companies.
Eric Groves, co-founder and CEO at online small business platform
Alignable, which has been [[tracking the impact of
inflation]{.underline}](https://www.alignable.com/forum/alignable-road-to-recovery-report-january-2022),
pointed to the percentage of businesses that indicate they are seeing
the highest level of cost increases. Overall, 78% of small businesses
say their costs are above pre-pandemic levels, but the largest block of
small businesses (29%) say they are seeing price hikes of 25% or more
for their business inputs. All of the headlines about inflation will
make it easier for small business owners to increase costs and not have
customers react as negatively as they might expect, but while over 50%
of businesses are passing along the cost increases to customers, only 9%
tell Alignable they can do this at a level where it is above breakeven
for them. "Costs have gone up more than their ability to pass it on
down, and that's what is critical to recovery," Groves said. "That's
where the feeling of stress is coming from. It's the squeezing of
margins, not just revenue \... what's going in their pocket," he added.
It is a fraught situation for small businesses trying to figure out how
much they can afford to charge without risking a decline in customer
numbers and loss of recurring revenue, with many small businesses still
not all the way back from Covid's shock. Alignable's data finds roughly
35%-37% of businesses saying that 90% or more of their customers from
the pre-Covid period have returned. Small business owners tend to be
optimistic by nature, but Alignable's [data shows them more pessimistic
now about their own recovery timelines. Last June, small business owners
expected revenue to be back at pre-Covid levels midway through 2022. Now
that has been pushed back by a full year to mid-2023.]{.underline}
Pusateri says inflation is beginning to eat into demand for her
company's granola, which is priced at the premium end of the product
category. "People are starting to look at what they are spending on. For
us, it's more of people starting to really look at pocketbooks," she
said. NFIB's [[most recent quarterly
survey]{.underline}](https://www.nfib.com/surveys/small-business-economic-trends/) found
the percentage of small business owners having to increase prices rising
to over 60%, the highest reading in the NFIB data since Q4 1974. "They
are getting squeezed by supply chain disruptions and inflation and
workforce shortages and already had to reinvent themselves a few times
over in the past few years, and are running out of options," said Kevin
Kuhlmann, who leads the NFIB's government relations team. "They are
continuing to adapt \... but [you can only increase prices so much
before you might see a loss]{.underline}," he said.  Nana Joes Granola
accessed a Covid economic injury disaster loan from the Small Business
Administration to fund its higher level of inventory buying, but that
financing program ended in 2021, and there is no indication the federal
government will reinstate it. Pusateri said she is now being forced to
contemplate business loans or taking on investors, a move she has not
had to make previously. "There aren't many policy options for issues
like inflation and the supply chain," Kuhlmann said. And even if
inflation is tamed, that does not mean prices will go down. "It's sort
of a new normal," he said. "You want to slow down price increases. It's
frustrating business owners." Small business does tend to be a lagging
rather than a leading indicator for the economy, but the growing worries
on Main Street are "a worrisome indication that inflation will be more
persistent," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics.
"Their pricing decisions tend to lag their bigger competitors, so if
small businesses are raising prices more aggressively it could signal
inflation becoming more endemic," Zandi said. And since small businesses
do not tend to think of themselves as having pricing power over the
long-term, if they are "becoming more emboldened" it is an indication
that inflationary pressures are broader-based, he added. The
CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Confidence Index score continues to
hover around all-time lows, holding at 44 out of 100, which was
unchanged from Q4 2021 and nearly identical to the all-time low score of
43 from a year ago. Overall, the business outlook is mixed, with 46% of
Main Street businesses saying they expect revenue to increase in the
next 12 months, according to the CNBC\|SurveyMonkey data. Politics is a
factor, with [only 33% of business owners saying conditions are
"good,]{.underline}" equal to the 33% of business owners who say they
support President Biden. The percentage of Democrats who expressed
support for Biden remains very high, at 83%, but did decline this
quarter by six percentage points. Just under half (49%) of Democratic
small business owners described conditions as good. A majority of
Democrats expect inflation to still be a problem six months from now
(67%) but that is considerably less than the 92% of Republicans who see
inflation sticking around. And Democrats are much more likely to believe
the Fed can control inflation, at 61%, versus 11% of Republicans
surveyed. Certain sectors within the small business community that are
more exposed to the global supply chain are facing greater pressures,
and there are positive indicators across the business landscape. As a
whole, companies are doing a good job of passing through costs to
customers with corporate profit margins as wide as they've ever been
back to World War II, but the benefits of pricing power are accruing
more to the largest corporations. Small businesses do not typically have
high cash reserve levels --- according to Alignable it is on average 34
days of cash on hand --- leading to a situation in which any kind of
financial hit is very difficult to recover from. "So as they are trying
to build back to recovery from Covid, every little bit of extra margin
they can eke out is critical, and with cost increases and the inability
to pass along, we will see more and more businesses struggling with
that," Groves said. A key measure of business health,
business-to-business payment transactions, isn't showing any signs of
stress, with even companies of 500 employees or less paying bills on
time. "At least so far, they are managing," Zandi said. Small businesses
sentiment, similar to consumer sentiment, tends to be reactive and based
on the most recent information or anecdote rather than longer-term
forecasting, which means that current gas and fuel prices, which can be
major inputs for small businesses, can lead to a sharper shift in
sentiment in the short-term. On Monday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York released an inflation survey that showed [[the first decline among
Americans' inflation
expectations]{.underline}](https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2022/20220214) in
over a year, though still near a record level. But Zandi said if nothing
else, the latest [data from Main Street is "proof positive we have a
problem]{.underline}." Pusateri described herself as "a lot less
confident now" after having made it through Covid, and even having seen
hyper-growth during the earlier part of the pandemic. "I thought getting
through 2020, 'oh my god, we did it.' We were still profitable. And
then, all of a sudden, I couldn't find ingredients." Nana Joes Granola
went from 135% profit growth during the packaged foods boom to currently
operating at less than breakeven in a pricing environment hitting it
from all sides. In addition to the supply issues, wage inflation and
lack of leverage as a buyer, freight charges across the country have

[Open source software is ubiquitous.]{.underline} It has become an
unequaled driver of technological innovation because organizations that
use it don\'t have to reinvent the wheel for common software components.

However, the [ubiquity of [open
source](https://www.darkreading.com/edge-articles/security-of-open-source-components-requires-more-collaborative-efforts) software
also presents a **significant security risk**, as it opens the door for
vulnerabilities to be introduced (intentionally or inadvertently) to the
consumers of open source software produ]{.underline}cts. The recent race
to address major vulnerabilities in the widely used Log4j code library
is the biggest sign yet that risks within the open source software
environment must be addressed.

The Open Source Appeal for Cybercriminals\
[The open source attack method is appealing to bad actors because it can
be widespread and highly effective. Attackers can use various methods to
obfuscate malicious changes contributed to open source projects, and the
rigor in reviewing code for security implications can vary widely across
projects]{.underline}. Without [stringent controls in place to detect
these malicious changes, they may go unnoticed until after they\'ve been
distributed and included in software across numerous

#### SMR's fail disastrously 

Arjun **Makhijani**, 3-25-20**21**, president of the Institute for
Energy and Environmental Research, \"Why Small Modular Nuclear Reactors
Won't Help Counter the Climate Crisis,\" Environmental Working Group,
[https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/why-small-modular-nuclear-reactors-wont-help-counter-climate-crisis
//](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/why-small-modular-nuclear-reactors-wont-help-counter-climate-crisis%20//)
CROSSINGS BY

Small modular nuclear reactors, or SMRs, are designed to generate less
than 300 megawatts of electricity -- several times less than typical
reactors, which have a range of 1,000 to 1,600 MW. While the individual
standardized modules would be small, plans typically call for several
modules to be installed at a single power generation site.   

The nuclear industry and the U. S. Department of Energy are promoting
the development of SMRs, supposedly to head off the most severe impacts
of climate change. But are SMRs a practical and realistic technology for
this purpose?

To answer, two factors are paramount to consider -- time and cost. These
factors can be used to divide SMRs into two broad categories:

Light water reactors based on the same general technical and design
principles as present-day power reactors in the U.S., which in theory
could be certified and licensed with less complexity and difficulty.

Designs that use a range of different fuel designs, such as solid balls
moving through the reactor core like sand, or molten materials flowing
through the core; moderators such as graphite; and coolants such as
helium, liquid sodium or molten salts.

[On both counts, the prospects for SMRs are poor. Here's
why.]{.underline}

Economics and scale

[Nuclear reactors are large because of economies of scale. A reactor
that produces three times as much power as an SMR does not need three
times as much steel or three times as many workers. This economic
penalty for small size was one reason for the early shutdown of many
small reactors built in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s.]{.underline}

[Proponents of SMRs claim that modularity and factory manufacture would
compensate for the poorer economics of small reactors. Mass production
of reactor components and their manufacture in assembly lines would cut
costs. Further, a comparable cost per kilowatt, the argument goes, would
mean far lower costs for each small reactor, reducing overall capital
requirements for the purchaser.]{.underline}

[**The road to such mass manufacturing will be rocky**. **Even with
optimistic assumptions about how quickly manufacturers could learn to
improve production efficiency and lower cost, thousands of SMRs, which
would all be higher priced in comparison to large reactors, would have
to be manufactured for the price per kilowatt for an SMR to be
comparable to that of a large reactor.**]{.underline}

[If history is any guide, the capital cost per kilowatt may not come
down at all. At a fleet-wide level, the learning rate in the U.S. and
France, the two countries with the highest number of nuclear plants, was
negative -- newer reactors have been, on the whole, more expensive than
earlier ones. And while the cost per SMR will be lower due to much
smaller size, several reactors would typically be installed at a single
site, raising total project costs for the purchaser again.]{.underline}

Mass manufacturing aspects

[If an error in a mass-manufactured reactor were to result in safety
problems, the whole lot might have to be recalled, as was the case with
the Boeing 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner jetliners. But how does one recall
a radioactive reactor? What will happen to an electricity system that
relies on factory-made identical reactors that need to be
recalled?]{.underline}

[These questions haven't been addressed by the nuclear industry or
energy policy makers -- indeed, they have not even been posed. Yet
recalls are a predictable and consistent feature of mass manufacturing,
from smartphones to jet aircraft.]{.underline}

The problem is not merely theoretical.

[One of the big economic problems of pressurized water reactors, the
design commonly chosen for light water SMRs, including the NuScale
design, which has received conditional certification from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, was the need to prematurely replace the steam
generators]{.underline} -- the massive, expensive heat exchangers where
the high-pressure hot water from the reactor is converted to the steam
that drives the turbine-generators. In the last decade, such problems
led to the permanent shutdown of two reactors at San Onofre, in Southern
California, and one reactor at Crystal River, in Florida.

[Several SMR light water designs place steam generators inside the
reactor vessel (Figure 1). Replacement would be exceedingly difficult at
best; problems with the steam generator could **result in permanent
reactor shutdown. **]{.underline}

We have already seen problems with modular construction. It was a
central aspect of the design of the Westinghouse AP1000 reactor, yet the
AP1000 reactors built in the U.S. and China have had significant
construction cost overruns and schedule delays. In 2015, a former member
of the Georgia Public Service Commission told The Wall Street Journal,
"Modular construction has not worked out to be the solution that the
utilities promised."

[The need for mass manufacturing also creates a chicken-and-egg economic
problem. Without the factories, SMRs can never hope to achieve the
theoretical cost reductions that are at the heart of the strategy to
compensate for the lack of economies of scale. But without the cost
reductions, there will not be the large number of orders to stimulate
the investments needed to set up the supply chain in the first
place.]{.underline}

[**The track record so far points to the same kind of dismal economic
failure for SMRs as their larger cousins**. Figure 2 shows the capital
cost escalation for the proposed NuScale reactor and actual costs of two
foreign SMRs. As a result, **the total cost of a proposed project in
Idaho using the NuScale design has already risen from around \$3
billion, in 2015, to \$6.1 billion, in 2020, long before any concrete
has been poured.**]{.underline}

[A small modular reactor (SMR) that NuScale has been developing since
the turn of the century is "too late, too expensive, too risky and too
uncertain," according to [an
analysis](http://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NuScales-Small-Modular-Reactor_February-2022.pdf) of
the project by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial
Analysis.]{.underline}

The first-of-its-kind SMR is a serious financial threat to the member
communities of the Utah Associated Municipal Power System that have
signed up for a share of its power and to any other communities and
utilities thinking about doing so. NuScale has optimistically targeted
the cost of power from the new plant at \$58 per megawatt-hour (MWh),
although some estimates predict costs for the power from new SMRs could
reach \$200/MWh.

![NuScale\'s Power Price Target vs Renewables
chart](media/image2.jpeg){width="4.166666666666667in" height="2.5in"}

Given that the costs of available renewable sources are falling rapidly
and that the SMR wouldn't generate electricity before 2029, the project
should be abandoned, said David Schlissel, IEEFA director of resource
planning analysis and the author of the report.

["The company has insisted its costs are firm and that the project will
be economical," Schlissel said. "But based on the track record so far
and past trends in nuclear power development, this is **highly
unlikely**."]{.underline}

The risks of the project include:

[**Rising Construction Costs**. NuScale claims it can build the SMR for
less than \$3,000 per kilowatt (kW). No nuclear power plant has been
built that cheaply in decades. The U.S. Department of Energy has
estimated the cost will exceed \$6,800/kW.]{.underline}

[**Longer Construction Time**. NuScale says the nuclear construction at
the SMR will be completed in less than 36 months. No new reactor has
been built in the U.S. in that short a time in 60 years. NuScale said in
2018 that it planned to have its SMR online by 2026. It now won't
generate electricity until mid-2029, at the earliest.]{.underline}

[**Operational Performance**. NuScale claims it will run at a 95%
capacity factor during its entire life. None of the 93 reactors
operating in the U.S. have met that goal. Only three have averaged
better than 85% during their first 10 years of operation, and the median
capacity factor for all U.S. reactors during these years has been only
67%.]{.underline}

[**Higher Costs for Participating Utilities**. The customers of
communities and utilities that remain signed up for the project after
construction begins will be liable for all of its costs and expenses,
regardless of the total and how far above \$58/MWh it ends up. They'll
even have to pay if the SMR is damaged or destroyed]{.underline}.

Schlissel said the communities should consider shifting to renewables
for their future sources of power[. The NuScale estimate of a \$58/MWh
price is already almost **twice as much as renewable prices**.
Utility-scale solar-plus-storage costs are about \$45/MWh and falling;
wind power costs \$30/MWh and are also dropping; and utility-scale solar
alone costs are at \$32 and falling.]{.underline}

["There are cheaper zero-carbon energy options available
now,"]{.underline} said Dennis Wamsted, an IEEFA energy analyst and
co-author of the report. "NuScale's SMR is not needed."

LWR - Light Water Reactor

[Innovation has long been America's greatest advantage over our global
competitors. We win by delivering products that disrupt old markets and
open up new ones. **We lose, however, when we rest on previous
successes**.]{.underline} From cell phones to solar modules, U.S.
industries have pioneered countless high-value technologies that were
ultimately replicated by foreign manufacturers who could undercut the
cost and overtake the market. [We are beginning to see this same pattern
play out with the LWR technologies that allowed the U.S. to reap huge
financial benefits and shape global standards for decades.]{.underline}
[If we are going to succeed in this very lucrative market in the
long-term, we have to keep inventing better nuclear technologies that
consumers will want---and competitors will want to copy.]{.underline}

The good news is, we're well positioned to deliver these new
technologies. Over 50 companies and organizations in the U.S. are
working to commercialize advanced nuclear reactor technologies. From a
technical perspective, many of our companies are further along than
those in China and Russia, though both countries can overtake us if we
fail to play our cards right. [The federal government can help U.S.
innovators maintain their head start by accelerating nuclear research,
development and demonstration and helping to scale up deployment of
small modular reactors (SMRs).]{.underline}

SMRs have a number of advantages over today's large GW nuclear reactors.
Because of their size (under 300 MW vs. 1,000 MW for today's reactors),
[SMRs can be built in a controlled factory setting and installed
module-by-module, enhancing the level of construction quality,
increasing efficiency, and lowering cost. Their size, versatility, and
passive safety features are also attractive to countries with smaller
grids and less experience with nuclear power. Taken together, these
features make SMRs more useful and easier to finance.]{.underline}

[But to get SMRs ready for export abroad, the U.S. must first
demonstrate readiness at home. Vendors have to gain experience with
licensing and constructing SMRs so that the U.S. nuclear supply chain
remains robust. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is essential to this
mission and has supported the development of SMR technology through the
SMR Licensing Technical Support (LTS) Program.]{.underline} They are now
working with companies to accelerate the licensing and siting process.
[DOE's SMR development efforts are making great progress, and they
should be continued and expanded to assist with manufacturing, assembly,
and operation of SMRs at home and for export]{.underline}. A substantial
ramp up of federal funding for SMRs beginning in fiscal year 2018 will
ensure that U.S. technologies reach the global market ahead of our
competitors and lock-in a significant amount of lucrative long-term
contracts.

**\-\-\-\-\-\--THEIR CUTTING ENDS HERE\-\-\-\-\-\--**

[**Beyond SMRs, the federal government must continue to incentivize even
more advanced reactors** that can use a variety of fuel types and
provide other safety, efficiency, and non- proliferation benefits. This
means building on the DOE's recently established Gateway for Accelerated
Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) initiative, which provides U.S. innovators
with test facilities, computational resources, and assistance with
licensing. **Congress must also lend its support to nascent efforts at
the N**uclear **R**egulatory **C**ommission **to modernize its licensing
process**, which is currently not structured to review innovative
technologies in a timely manner.]{.underline} Policymakers will need to
begin a conversation about how these new designs will be incorporated
into international security and non- proliferation protocols. [And
within the next four years, partnerships between the federal government
and private sector innovators will be needed to construct
"first-of-a-kind" advanced reactors.]{.underline} Legislation addressing
many of these needs moved rapidly through Congress in 2016 with broad
bipartisan support. Policymakers should ensure that these legislative
solutions make it across the finish line as quickly as possible in the
new Congress.

### AT: Russia CP\-\--NFU

#### **NFU [fails]{.underline} --- laundry list**

Rebeccah L. **Heinrichs 20,** senior fellow at Hudson Institute
specializing in US national defense policy, Reject \'No First Use\'
Nuclear Policy, No Publication, 6-30-2020,
<https://www.hudson.org/research/16328-reject-no-first-use-nuclear-policy/shppp>

The [reality is that every single American president,]{.underline}
Democrat and Republican alike, [has **rejected an NFU declaration**
because to do so would invite **unacceptable risk** that could yield
**catastrophic war**---and for **no tangible benefit** at
all.]{.underline}

[This is true for **four reasons.**]{.underline}

[First]{.underline}, adopting an [NFU policy invites a strategic
**non-nuclear attack** against the American people, our
allies]{.underline} and our interests. [An NFU declaration broadcasts to
America's enemies that they can proceed with a chemical weapons attack
on U.S. forces]{.underline} and their families, [can proceed with a
**biological attack**]{.underline} on an American city [and]{.underline}
can proceed with an overwhelming [**conventional attack** against
critical U.S. assets, all **without fear of nuclear
retaliation**]{.underline}. [Any]{.underline} would-be
[enemy]{.underline} [could carry out an infinite number of attacks short
of a nuclear attack]{.underline}, while the NFU-endorsing U.S. president
assures their safety from our nuclear weapon arsenal.

[An NFU policy is **especially unwise** now]{.underline}, while the
United States contends with not one, but two major power threats. [Both
Russia and China are **expanding their military capabilities** and have
acted in ways that **demonstrate their willingness** to attack sovereign
nations and redraw borders.]{.underline}

Of the two, China poses the single greatest threat to America's national
security and way of life. General Secretary Xi Jinping and his Chinese
Communist Party ([CCP]{.underline}) are now [in the midst of a rapid
modernization of their military]{.underline}. [China]{.underline} has
the most **[diverse missile force]{.underline}** on the planet [and has
launched more **ballistic missiles** for testing and training than the
rest of the world combined]{.underline}. Nor has Beijing neglected its
nuclear capabilities---although their efforts are furtive, we know the
CCP is investing in a large force, with delivery systems capable of
launching nuclear weapons. Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency
Lt. General Robert P. Ashley, Jr. said in 2019 that the intelligence
community believes China is likely to "at least double the size of its
nuclear stockpile in the course of implementing the most rapid expansion
and diversification of its nuclear arsenal in China's history." The
number commonly cited for China's stockpile is around 300. But it is
plausible that there are actually many more than 300, as one highly
credible former government official confided to me.

What's more, [China likely has an **advanced chemical warfare**
program]{.underline}. Like its nuclear program, [China does not
reveal]{.underline} to the United States [what, exactly, it does
have]{.underline}. But the more we learn about the CCP's gross abuse of
religious minorities, including of the Uyghurs imprisoned in Xinjiang
concentration camps, the more our hackles should be raised. [Western
democracies view any use of chemical weapons as
unconscionable]{.underline}, [but the evidence shows **our enemies do
not share this view.**]{.underline}

Although the scope of Russia's economy and the ambitiousness of its
national objectives pale in comparison to China's, [Russia still seeks
to undermine the United States and our allies]{.underline} wherever it
can. Like China, [it is investing heavily in its nuclear forces and has
**repeatedly violated** U.S. arms control agreements]{.underline}. To
take one particularly abhorrent and brazen example, on August 6, 2018,
the Russian government used chemical weapons on British soil in an
attempt to assassinate a former Russian spy, eliciting sanctions by the
United States.

That brings us to [the second reason NFU is a terrible
idea]{.underline}. The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should
be working to create more **complex calculations** for China and
Russia]{.underline}---[not making]{.underline} their calculations
[simpler]{.underline}. Every policy decision related to arms control,
the make-up and quality of America's own weapons and our public
declarations should be made with one goal in mind: to deter acts of
aggression against the United States. [The]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [must keep our options
open]{.underline}, [**maintain some ambiguity** about what we may do and
force our enemies to make complex calculations and always doubt whether
an act of aggression against the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [would be worth the punitive cost]{.underline}.

[Third]{.underline}, [our adversaries would **hardly restrict
themselves**]{.underline} if America were to adopt a true NFU policy. In
fact, [we have reason to believe that many are **willing** to use
nuclear weapons first in a conflict.]{.underline}

Start with Russia. [Russian officials have **implied their comfort**
with the use of nuclear weapons in a conventional conflict]{.underline},
have [at times **threatened nuclear** use against purely defensive
systems and]{.underline}, in at least one instance, [an official stated
that the conditions for a Russian nuclear use could as]{.underline}
**[small as a]{.underline}** [regional]{.underline}, [or]{.underline}
even a [local]{.underline}, [conflict]{.underline}. In June 2015, the
Obama administration's deputy secretary of defense, Robert Work, and
then-Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral James Winnefeld
informed Congress that "[Russian military doctrine includes what some
have called an '**escalate to de-escalate'** strategy]{.underline}---a
strategy that purportedly seeks to de-escalate a conventional conflict
through coercive threats, including limited nuclear use." Then-Trump
administration Secretary of Defense James Mattis testified to the same
concern in 2018.

As for China, the Chinese have purported to embrace NFU. Way back on
October 16, 1964, China declared that it will never, at any time or
under any circumstances, be the first to use nuclear weapons." For
decades, that was blindly accepted by those who wished to believe
it---including NFU proponents in the U.S. But [current Commander of U.S.
Strategic Command]{.underline} Admiral Richard, when [speaking about the
Chinese NFU policy, told senators]{.underline} in February 2020, "I
could drive a truck through that no first use policy." He [went on to
explain]{.underline} that the [Chinese nuclear program **lacks
transparency and fosters distrust**]{.underline}. Worse, the CCP's
dubious claims to disputed Chinese territory raises concerns about how,
and where, Beijing may employ nuclear weapons. Moreover, the CCP is
engaged in a robust disinformation campaign across all areas of its
government and society: [America **should not** presume anything but
deceit from our number one geopolitical threat.]{.underline}

[Finally]{.underline}, [adopting an NFU policy would cause allied
nations]{.underline}, who have rightly forsworn nuclear weapons and [who
rely on the American nuclear umbrella, to **doubt our
assurances**]{.underline}. And if allies and partners can no longer rely
on our nuclear umbrella, [they will develop their own]{.underline}. The
result of the nuclear idealists' efforts, zealous as their mission is to
take the world down to zero nuclear weapons, could [ironically result in
**precipitous nuclear proliferation**.]{.underline}

President Obama, recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for, in part, his
denuclearization aspirations, eschewed an NFU declaration. Though he was
ideologically motivated to pursue the idealist nuclear disarmament
agenda, reality and the weight of responsibility to protect the American
people won the day. It is inexplicable that his vice president, who has
decades of experience grappling with the global threats and has had a
front-row seat to these executive decisions, would still hold to the
notion that NFU is good policy.

[We must see the world as it is. We might wish that other nations will
follow our lead and do as we do, but other nations **do not hold** to
our same moral judgments]{.underline}. We should not assume that our
adversaries will make the same strategic and operational decisions that
we make. The [historical evidence shows that they are **not inspired**
by our efforts to de-emphasize nuclear weapons]{.underline}, either by
unilaterally moving toward lower numbers or by placing restrictions on
testing.

Every American president should keep our options open, [maintain
strategic ambiguity and reject NFU.]{.underline}

[[Improvements in the productivity of robots drive divergence between
advanced and developing countries]{.mark} if robots substitute easily
for workers]{.underline}. In addition, [[those improvements will]{.mark}
tend to [increase incomes but also increase income inequality]{.mark},
at least during the transition and possibly in the long run for some
groups of workers, in both advanced and developing
economies.]{.underline}

There is no silver bullet for averting divergence. [Given the fast pace
of the robot revolution, [developing countries need to invest in raising
aggregate productivity and skill levels more urgently than ever]{.mark}
before, so that their labor force is complemented rather than
substituted by robots.]{.underline} Of course[, this is easier said than
done. In our model, increases in total factor productivity---which
account for the many institutional and other fundamental differences
between developing and advanced countries not captured by labor and
capital inputs---]{.underline}are especially beneficial as they
incentivize more robots and physical capital accumulation[. Such
improvements are always beneficial, but the gains are stronger in the
context of the artificial intelligence revolution.]{.underline}

Our findings also underscore the importance of human capital
accumulation to prevent divergence and point to potentially different
growth dynamics among developing economies with different skill levels.
[The landscape is likely going to be much more challenging for
developing countries which have hoped for high dividends from a
much-anticipated demographic transition]{.underline}. The growing youth
population in developing countries was hailed by policymakers as
possibly a big chance to benefit from a transition of jobs from China as
a result of its graduating middle-income status. [Our findings show that
[robots]{.mark} may [steal]{.mark} these [jobs]{.mark}. Policymakers
should act [to]{.mark} mitigate those risks. Especially in the face of
these new technologically-driven pressures, a drastic shift to
[rapidly]{.mark} improve productivity gains and invest in education and
skills development will [capitalize on the much-anticipated demographic
transition]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### A neutral Ukraine is not good

**Aron 22**\[Leon, Leon Aron is the author of Roads to the Temple,
Yeltsin, and many other books and essays. He is a senior fellow at the
American Enterprise Institute., "A Neutral Ukraine Is a Dangerous Idea",

<https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/ukraine-neutrality-peace-agreement-finland/629473/>\]

[But dropping sanctions under that circumstance would be a **costly
mistake**. Unlike the Soviet Union's rules for Finland during the Cold
War, Putin's conditions for the cessation of hostilities will not end
with Ukraine's neutrality.]{.underline}

After World War II, Moscow allowed Finland to keep its Western-style
democracy and market economy in exchange for an implicit but inviolable
pledge not to join NATO or Western economic and political bodies. Not
coincidentally, Finland entered the European Union only after the fall
of the Soviet Union. But relations between Finland and the Soviet Union
during the Cold War differed enormously from those between Ukraine and
Putin's Russia today.

[Ukraine is immeasurably more important to Russia than Finland was to
the Soviet Union. It is central to both Russia's national identity and
the political imperatives of the Putin regime's survival]{.underline}.
Helsinki is not Kyiv, which Putin has extolled as [the
birthplace](https://tass.ru/arhiv/548753?utm_source=google.com&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=google.com&utm_referrer=google.com) of
Russian Christianity and the [mother of Russian
cities](https://news.obozrevatel.com/politics/49831-putin-nazval-kiev-materyu-russkih-gorodov.htm).
The Ukrainians are the "[same
people](https://tass.ru/arhiv/548753?utm_source=google.com&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=google.com&utm_referrer=google.com)"
as the Russians, Putin claims. They are united, he declared in a [long
essay](https://rg.ru/2021/07/12/statia-vladimira-putina-ob-istoricheskom-edinstve-russkih-i-ukraincev.html) published
last summer, by the same language and economic ties, and, most
important, by the Orthodox faith. The Soviet Union did not view its
Finnish neighbors the same way.

[Most critically, a democratic, politically stable, economically
vibrant, and Western-oriented Ukraine is an existential threat to
Putin's stagnant militarized dictatorship. Why, the Russians will
inevitably begin asking sooner or later, are our brethren to the
southwest free and growing richer, while we are daily insulted by a
repressive government and our incomes continue to decline?]{.underline}

[Putin does not need a "neutral" Ukraine; he needs a failed Ukraine. His
desire to create one---not to fend off a mythical NATO menace---is what
this invasion is all about. Beyond a promise that Ukraine not ally
militarily with the West, Russia will demand its neighbor's
"demilitarization"---that is, disarmament, which will leave Ukraine with
a rump armed forces, shorn of modern weapons.]{.underline} [Putin will
also require the recognition of Crimea as part of Russia and of Donetsk
and Luhansk as "independent" states---in reality, Russian protectorates
inside Ukraine.]{.underline}

Thus far, Zelensky has held out against these assaults on his country's
sovereignty by proposing a 15-year period of negotiations over Crimea
and by insisting on discussing the status of Donetsk and
Luhansk [directly with
Putin](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-and-russia-hold-talks-as-zelensky-criticizes-west-on-sanctions-arms-11648549561).
But how long can the Ukrainian president persevere as Russian invaders
keep killing Ukrainian civilians and destroying his country's towns and
cities? [And how long before the West begins to push the Ukrainian
president, gently or otherwise, toward a "settlement"?]{.underline}

[Above all, the democratic West wants peace, while Putin needs
victory]{.underline}. He is well aware of this fundamental disconnect
between Moscow's aims and those of Ukraine's Western supporters. [This
is to his enormous advantage. He knows that time is on his
side.]{.underline}

Furthermore, as it did in the negotiations over the Minsk II agreement,
forced on Ukraine after the Russian military and its Donbas proxies
defeated Ukrainian forces in 2015, Moscow will insist that Ukraine
fulfill the obligations under peace accords before Russia implements its
part of the bargain. But with Moscow having so far rejected
any [international
mediation](https://jamestown.org/program/russia-smashing-ukraine-into-pax-russica-part-two/),
who will certify, for instance, the withdrawal of Russian troops from
Ukraine?  If Moscow's past conduct is an indication, Putin will almost
certainly insist on keeping an undefined number of troops as
"peacekeepers" and "defenders" of its Donetsk and Luhansk enclaves, just
as its "peacekeeping" contingents continue to guard the de facto
protectorates that Russia has established in other former Soviet
republics: [Transnistria](https://balkaninsight.com/2022/03/11/moldovas-rebel-region-stays-neutral-in-russias-war-on-ukraine/),
in Moldova; [South Ossetia and
Abkhazia](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/08/10/russia-invasion-georgia-12-years-no-end-ambassador-david-bakradze-interview/),
in Georgia.

[Most important, who will guarantee Russia's compliance---or compel it
if need be]{.underline}? Zelensky's wish list of potential enforcers has
variously included Great Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Israel,
Poland, and Turkey. Yet given the ferocity and abandon that Russia has
demonstrated, along with
Putin's [threat](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/opinion/ukraine-putin-russia-times-opinion-writers.html) to
meet any intervention with a reaction the "likes of which you have never
seen in history"---a transparent hint at [using nuclear
weapons](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/putin-nuclear-weapons-system-presidential-power/627058/)---these
countries have responded [tepidly at
best](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-proposal-for-nato-style-security-guarantee-greeted-with-skepticism-11648683375) to
Zelensky's invitation to go to war with Russia if it violates a peace
deal with Ukraine.

[Without an international security guarantee for Ukraine, is there any
doubt that Russia will interpret a peace agreement as the right to
meddle aggressively in Ukraine's politics and seek to reorient the
Ukrainian economy toward Russia?]{.underline}

[The [invasion](https://www.theatlantic.com/category/russias-invasion-ukraine/),
with its wanton assault on Ukrainian cities and industrial base and
massacre of Ukrainians, is likely just the first step in Putin's
long-term systematic demoralization and depredation of its neighbor. The
ultimate aim is submitting the country to Russian control.]{.underline}

Of course, a truce stopping Russia's barbaric onslaught might seem worth
almost any concessions forced on Kyiv by Moscow. [But the West should
stop indulging the false hope of "Finlandization" and see the potential
armistice for what it is: not a lasting peace that would preserve much
of Ukraine's independence, but rather only a temporary cease-fire in
Putin's long war to end a sovereign Ukraine. **Acknowledging this
reality is essential to thwarting this plan**.]{.underline}

#### Nah that stuff [sucks]{.underline}! 

Lauren **1NC Sommer 22,** Vacuuming carbon from the air could help stop
climate change. Not everyone agrees, NPR.org, 5-2-2022,
<https://www.npr.org/2022/05/02/1095097566/carbon-dioxide-removal-climate-emissions/shppp>

Option 3: Pull it out of the air with big machines

Last year, the largest carbon removal project of its kind started up in
Iceland. The Orca plant, run by the Swiss company Climeworks, is
essentially a carbon vacuum. Fans pull in air, the carbon is captured by
a special material and then it\'s pumped underground into geologic
formations where it mineralizes, remaining trapped.

Other \"direct air capture\" plants, as they\'re known, are in
development in the U.S. But most are still pilot projects. The
technology is expensive and requires a lot of energy. One analysis shows
that capturing a ton of carbon this way takes almost as much energy as
burning 100 gallons of gasoline, which produces a ton of carbon. If the
energy used isn\'t renewable, it would add more heat-trapping gases to
the atmosphere.

\[THEIR CARD ENDS\]

Oh, and capturing emissions from fossil fuels doesn\'t count

Some power plants that burn fossil fuels like coal and natural gas are
also working on capturing their carbon emissions and then permanently
storing them underground. That helps keep new emissions from reaching
the atmosphere, but it doesn\'t lower that overall amount of greenhouse
gases already emitted. Fossil fuels hold loads of carbon that used to be
buried underground, so trapping those emissions only neutralizes
themselves and doesn\'t help offset emissions from other sources.

So, how much carbon removal is needed?

It all depends on how fast humans can reduce their use of fossil fuels
now. But the sooner concentrations of greenhouse gases fall in the
atmosphere, the faster the trend of rapidly warming temperatures can be
stopped.

By midcentury, carbon removal may need to be scaled up to 10 billion
tons of carbon per year, according to a report from the National
Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. Right now, direct air
capture plants are just sequestering 0.01 million tons.

The recent report from the IPCC published overall estimates of how much
carbon dioxide removal might be needed, but those numbers were removed
due to inconsistencies in how land-based emissions are calculated among
different countries. Still, through the end of the century, the report
found up to 1 trillion tons of carbon dioxide may need to be removed
through bioenergy and direct air capture alone.

[What are the **downsides of carbon removal**?]{.underline}

[Cost looms large for carbon capture]{.underline}. The [Biden
administration recently set a goal of getting carbon removal to below
\$100 per metric ton within a decade. Currently, capturing carbon
directly from the air with technology can cost **six or seven times
that**]{.underline}. And no one is really sure who will pay for it.

[Carbon capture projects could also have a **big land
impact**]{.underline}, [requiring **large industrial facilities** that
transport carbon underground]{.underline}, a big concern for
environmental justice communities who already bear a heavier burden of
living near industry. [Demand for **bioenergy crops** could displace
both people and ecosystems that are **key to
biodiversity**]{.underline}.

Some climate activists also worry that focusing on [**unproven
technologies** now will dissuade world governments from rapidly cutting
their fossil fuel use]{.underline}. They say oil and gas companies are
making the case that fossil fuels can keep operating with carbon removal
technologies, [though that will likely **take decades or longer to get
established**]{.underline}.

\"This is influencing many industrial countries to kick the can down the
road and make it seem as if we don\'t need to act urgently and
unequivocally right now because later there will be this technology,\"
says Genevieve Guenther, founder of the climate advocacy group End
Climate Silence and affiliate faculty at The New School. \"[It\'s a new
form of climate denial]{.underline}.\"

No matter the path that countries choose on climate change, the IPCC
report emphasizes that carbon dioxide removal will never be the main
strategy to combat climate change. Cutting emissions is.

\"There is a certain newness factor from carbon dioxide removal and it
gets a lot of attention,\" says Oliver Geden, senior fellow at the
German Institute for International and Security Affairs and an author of
the recent IPCC report. \"But still, it [should not be the priority of
what we\'re doing. It should not be the thing we\'re focusing on. The
focus **needs to be on reducing emissions** and carbon dioxide removal
is **only a complement** to that.\"]{.underline}
