Oct 14, 2020( Foreign
Policy: [http://www.foreignpolicy.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu](http://www.foreignpolicy.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/)/
Delivered by Newstex) The United Nations Convention on Certain
Conventional **Weapons** Group of Governmental Experts met late last
month to discuss lethal, **autonomous** **weapons**. The semiannual
meetings are the first serious effort by global governments to
control **autonomous** **weapons**. And the **weapons** pose serious
risks to global security: Even the best artificial intelligence isn\'t
well suited to distinguishing farmers from soldiers and may be trained
only on laboratory data\[1\] that is a poor substitute for real
battlefields. As U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres\[2\] wrote on
Twitter, \'**Autonomous** machines with the power and discretion to
select targets and take lives without human involvement are politically
unacceptable, morally repugnant and should be prohibited by
international law.\'

[Organizations such as the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots\[3\], the
International Committee for Robot Arms Control\[4\], and Human Rights
Watch\[5\] advocate for a comprehensive ban on all autonomous weapons,
but such [a ban is unlikely to succeed]{.mark}. The [military potential
of autonomous weapons is too great]{.mark}. Autonomous weapons guard
ships\[6\] against small boat attacks, search for terrorists\[7\], stand
sentry\[8\], and destroy adversary air defenses\[9\]. Just a few weeks
ago, an AI simulation\[10\] defeated a living, breathing F-16 pilot five
to zero in a simulated dogfight. Such an AI system could conceivably
command a future aerial drone. [No doubt the technology will grow and
mature]{.mark}. [No]{.mark} serious [military power would give up such
potential]{.mark}---especially when concerns are theoretical and
adversaries may not follow suit. Russia didn\'t even show up to the
experts\' meeting. Instead of a broad ban on all autonomous weapons, the
international community should identify and focus restrictions on the
highest-risk weapons: drone swarms and autonomous chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear weapons, known as CBRN weapons. [A narrower
focus would increase the likelihood of global agreement]{.mark}, while
providing a normative foundation for broader restrictions.]{.underline}
In 2018, the tech company Intel\[11\] flew 2,018 drones at once in a
Guinness World Record-breaking light show in Folsom, California. Earlier
this year, Russia\[12\] and China\[13\] flew light shows of more than
2,000 drones too. The drones carried flashy lights and were meant as
modern fireworks, but similar drones could be designed for war with
thousands of guns, bombs, and missiles.A thousand-drone swarm has a
thousand points of potential error. And because drones in a true swarm
communicate with one another, errors may propagate throughout the swarm.
For example, one drone may misidentify a cruise ship as an aircraft
carrier, then unleash the full might of the swarm on a few thousand
civilians. The same may occur if the drone correctly identifies the
cruise ship as not a target, but the word not is lost, due to simple
accident or adversary jamming. Swarm communication also leads to
emergent behavior---collective behaviors of the swarm that do not depend
on the individual parts---that further reduces both the predictability
and understandability\[14\] of the **weapon**. As P.W. Singer, a
strategist and senior fellow at New America, wrote in his book Wired for
War\[15\], \'a swarm takes the action on its own, which may not always
be exactly where and when the commander wants it. Nothing happens in a
swarm directly, but rather through the complex relationships among the
parts.\' Drone swarms pose a greater threat to powerful militaries,
because cheap drones\[16\] can be flung one after another against
expensive platforms until they fall. In 2018, a group calling itself the
Free Alawites Movement claimed responsibility for launching 13
drones\[17\] made largely of plywood, duct tape, and lawnmower engines
that attacked Russia\'s Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. The movement claimed
the successful destruction of a \$300 million S-400 surface-to-air
missile system. (The exact identity of the \'Free Alawites Movement\' is
unclear. The only attacks it has claimed are the Khmeimim attacks and
another drone attack on a Russian naval base\[18\] in Syria on the same
day. Sources\[19\] have also attributed the attacks to the Islamic
State, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, and Ahrar al-Sham.) Russian officials
acknowledged the drones flew **autonomously** and were preprogrammed to
drop bombs on the base but claim no damage was done. (The Russian
officials did not comment on whether the drones communicated with one
another to make a true drone swarm.) However, in Libya, Turkish
Bayraktar TB2 drones\[20\] disabled at least nine\[21\] Russian air
defense systems. The Bayraktar drones are considerably more advanced
than those used in Syria, but they illustrate the same principle: Drones
pose major threats to air defenses and other expensive systems. An
adversary could fling tons of drones\[22\] against a \$1.8 billion USS
Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer in an attempt to disable or
destroy it and still have a cost advantage. Facing such a threat, great
powers should choose to lead---rather than resist---the arms control
charge for certain **weapons**. Yes, great powers would give up the
potential to unleash their own massive swarms, but swarms are likely to
favor weaker powers. If swarms are most effective when used en
masse\[23\]against big, expensive platforms, then major powers that
possess such expensive equipment stand to lose the most. Swarms might
also be easier to control. A key arms control challenge
for **autonomous** **weapons** is knowing if a **weapon** is
actually **autonomous**. At root, autonomy is just a matter of
programming the **weapon** to fire under given conditions, however
simple or complex. A simple landmine\[24\] explodes when enough weight
is put upon it; an **autonomous** turret fires based on analyzed
information collected from sensors and any design constraints.
With **autonomous** **weapons**, an outside observer cannot tell whether
the **weapon** operates under predesigned rules or is being controlled
remotely. However, no human can reasonably control a swarm of thousands
of drones. The complexity is simply too much. They must monitor hundreds
of video, infrared, or other feeds, while planning the swarm\'s actions
and deciding who to kill. Such a massive swarm must be **autonomous**,
may be a **weapon** of mass destruction\[25\] in its own right, and
could carry\[26\] traditional **weapons** of mass destruction.
Discussion of **autonomous** **weapons** takes place under the auspices
of the Convention on Certain Conventional **Weapons**, assuming
the **weapon** fires bullets, bombs, or missiles. But
an **autonomous** **weapon** could just as readily be armed with CBRN
agents.**Autonomous** vehicles are a great way to deliver chemical,
radiological, and biological **weapons**. An **autonomous** vehicle
cannot get sick with anthrax, nor choke on chlorine. Drones can more
directly target enemies, while adjusting trajectories based on local
wind and humidity conditions. Plus, small drones can take to the air,
fly indoors\[27\], and work together\[28\] to carry out attacks.
Operatives from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria\[29\] were
reportedly quite interested in using drones to carry out radiological
and potentially chemical attacks. North Korea also has an arsenal of
chemical, biological, and nuclear **weapons** and a thousand-drone
fleet\[30\]. When robots make decisions on nuclear **weapons**, the fate
of humanity is at stake. In 1983\[31\], at the height of the Cold War, a
Soviet early warning system concluded the United States had launched
five nuclear missiles at the Soviet Union. The computer expressed the
highest degree of confidence in the conclusion. The likely response:
immediate nuclear retaliation to level U.S. cities and kill millions of
American civilians. Fortunately, Stanislav Petrov, the Soviet officer in
charge of the warning system, concluded the computer was wrong. Petrov
was correct. Without him, millions of people would be dead. New
restrictions on **autonomous** CBRN **weapons** should be a relatively
easy avenue for new restrictions. A wide range of treaties already
restrict production, export, and use of CBRN **weapons** from the Geneva
Convention to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the
Chemical **Weapons** Convention. At minimum, governments could
collectively agree to incorporate **autonomous** **weapons** in all
applicable CBRN **weapons** treaties. This would signal a greater
willingness to adopt restrictions on **autonomous** **weapons** without
a requirement to resolve the question of **autonomous** **weapons** with
conventional payloads. Of course, a **ban** may require giving up
capabilities like a nuclear \'dead hand\[32\]\'---in the words of
proponents, \'an automated strategic response system based on artificial
intelligence\'---but nuclear **weapons** experts\[33\] are
overwhelmingly\[34\] against\[35\] the idea. The risks to great powers
of increased CBRN **weapons** proliferation and accidental nuclear war
are far greater than any deterrent advantage already gained with a
robust conventional and nuclear force.
Placing **autonomous** **weapons** on the global agenda in the first
place is a definite success---a global treaty can never be made if no
one cares enough to even talk about it---but the question is what
happens next. Do government experts simply keep talking or do these
meetings lead to actionable treaties? What combination of inducements,
export controls, transparency measures, sanctions, and, in extreme
events, the use of force are best suited to preventing the threat?
[[Historically, comprehensive bans took decades---the global community
took about 70 years to go from the Geneva Protocols against
chemical weapons usage to states giving up
the weapons]{.mark}---but autonomous weapons are growing and
proliferating rapidly. [Countries might not be willing
to ban the weapons outright]{.mark}, but banning the
highest-risk autonomous weapons---drone swarms
and autonomous weapons armed with CBRN agents---could provide a
foundation for reducing autonomous weapons risks. Great powers would
give up little, while improving their own security.]{.underline}

mimou\]

[Sharp divisions over the adequacy of President Joe Biden's fiscal 2023
request for the Navy's shipbuilding budget emerged]{.underline} at two
House hearings Wednesday.

The differences, which fell largely along party lines, were manifest at
a House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense budget hearing with the
Pentagon top brass and a House Armed Services Committee hearing with the
leaders of the Navy and Marine Corps.

At the Defense Appropriations hearing, the [top Republican
appropriator]{.underline}, [Kay
Granger](https://www.rollcall.com/members/469?utm_source=memberLinks&utm_medium=memberlinks&personid=469) of
Texas, and the [ranking Republican member of the Defense
panel]{.underline}, [Ken
Calvert](https://www.rollcall.com/members/70?utm_source=memberLinks&utm_medium=memberlinks&personid=70) of
California, [complained the Navy would decommission significantly more
ships in fiscal 2023]{.underline} than it plans to procure, while
China's fleet is already larger --- and growing more rapidly --- than
America's.

But [[Betty
McCollum](https://www.rollcall.com/members/8151?utm_source=memberLinks&utm_medium=memberlinks&personid=8151),
D-Minn.]{.underline}, the Appropriations subcommittee's chairwoman,
sought to [rebut these arguments by noting that nearly half of China's
larger Navy is made up of relatively small, support ships]{.underline}.
She also noted that America's allies in Asia have plenty of warships to
bring to any fight. 

A [similar debate took place Wednesday at the House Armed Services
Committee]{.underline}. Virginia [Democrat [Elaine
Luria](https://www.rollcall.com/members/118568?utm_source=memberLinks&utm_medium=memberlinks&personid=118568) joined
several of her GOP colleagues in taking issue with the declining U.S.
fleet size. ]{.underline}

The \$[27.8 billion fiscal 2023 Navy budget would fund nine new
warships, the administration has said]{.underline}. But [24 ships are
being retired, for a net loss of 15. ]{.underline}

The nine ships in the Freedom class of Littoral Combat Ships are a
high-profile example of the decommissionings. 

But Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday said at the committee
hearing that the [Navy is **using the \$3.6 billion saved** from
retirements over the next five years **on new ships and more modern
weapons**]{.underline} --- [which he called "**systems that
matter.\"**]{.underline}

The [decision on which ships to retire was driven largely by whether the
Navy could "count on them to actually move the needle in a high end
fight with an adversary like China]{.underline},\" Gilday said.

From Ukraine to China

The House Appropriations subcommittee hearing ran the gamut of subjects,
from troops' housing costs to cyberwarfare. 

The conflict in Ukraine was a hot topic. Asked if the war could escalate
into a conflict between Russia and NATO, Defense Secretary Lloyd J.
Austin III said Russian President Vladimir Putin "doesn't want to take
on the NATO alliance." 

Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
Russia has fired hypersonic missiles in Ukraine, but the weapons have
not created "significant or game-changing effects."

McCollum, meanwhile, said at the end of the hearing that she supports
another round of base closings to reduce excess infrastructure, which
she said is 20 percent by one estimate.  

But the [shipbuilding issue was front and center]{.underline} for
members of both parties at both House hearings Wednesday. 

At the Appropriations hearing, [Calvert predicted "**glaring capability
gaps**" as a result of a shrinking fleet]{.underline}, noting also that
hundreds of military aircraft would be retired under Biden's fiscal 2023
plan. Calvert said [China is building 22 ships this year to America\'s
nine.]{.underline}

China has 355 ships in total and is projected to have 460 by 2030,
according to a Pentagon report last fall.

The U.S. Navy, by comparison, would drop from 298 ships today to 280 by
2027 under the Biden plan. 

Granger [asked the department's leaders why they would "mothball" the
LCS ships under these circumstances]{.underline}, saying she has
"[serious concerns about the way that was determined]{.underline}."

Milley replied that the issue \"comes down to balance in terms of
what\'s affordable and what the Navy can afford and what the Department
of Defense can afford."

Austin said the overall budget "maintains our edge but does not take
that edge for granted."

Numbers game

McCollum, meanwhile, said she is interested in exploring possible new
uses for at least some of the Littoral Combat Ships that are facing
early retirement.

But she pushed back at length against the GOP argument that America's
Navy is a shadow of China's. And she made a rarely heard point: that
trying to catch up in quantity is a vain effort.

"There's a simple fact here: The [United States does not have the
shipbuilding industrial base to manufacture, let alone
maintain]{.underline}, a [Navy that can completely]{.underline}
--- numerically --- [compete with China]{.underline}," McCollum said.
"But [quantity alone is not the point]{.underline}. It's [quality and
capability that matter]{.underline}, as you gentlemen pointed out," she
said to Austin and Milley, who were joined by Defense Department
Comptroller Mike McCord. 

She then noted that China's fleet --- which she put at 500 ships --- is
comprised of 230 smaller support vessels. She also noted that three of
America's allies in the region --- Japan, South Korea and Australia
--- have fleets totaling more than 350 ships combined, though she
acknowledged some of those are smaller too.

"The debate I believe needs to be very substantiated, and not just
picking a number that we think might be for the right number of ships
for the U.S. to have," she added.

She also alluded to the need to get ships in and out of maintenance
faster, so that the actual number of deployed ships can grow. 

'**[Systems that matter']{.underline}**

Meanwhile, at the House Armed Services Committee, [several Republicans
joined Luria in voicing concern about the U.S. fleet
size: ]{.underline}[Mike D.
Rogers](https://www.rollcall.com/members/15323?utm_source=memberLinks&utm_medium=memberlinks&personid=15323) of

Wisconsin and [Michael
Waltz](https://www.rollcall.com/members/119499?utm_source=memberLinks&utm_medium=memberlinks&personid=119499) of
Florida.

But [Gilday, the Navy's top admiral]{.underline}, replied that [the
radar on older cruisers being retired can't see the threat, leaving them
vulnerable.]{.underline} Similarly, [the **anti-submarine warfare
system** on the nine Littoral Combat Ships the Navy wants to
decommission]{.underline} "[**did not work out**

"After about a year and a half \[of\] study, I [refuse to put an
additional dollar against a system that would not be able to track a
high-end submarine in today's environment]{.underline},"
[Gilday]{.underline} said.

STC

WASHINGON --- [The White House on]{.underline} Tuesday [doubled down on
a brewing fight with Congress over]{.underline} legislative [efforts
that would prevent the retirement of]{.underline} several
[ships]{.underline} and aircraft as well as the scrapping of a nuclear
modernization program.

With the House set to vote on the National Defense Authorization Act
later this week, [the White House's O]{.underline}ffice of
[M]{.underline}anagement and [B]{.underline}udget released a statement
that said it "[strongly opposes" congressional efforts to block its
retirement and divestment plans.]{.underline}

The White House argued that blocking its efforts "to divest or retire
lower priority platforms" inflated the top line of the \$840 billion
defense authorization bill, which already stands at \$37 billion more
than President Joe Biden's budget request.

"The President's budget request for \[fiscal 2023\] was developed in a
thoughtful and deliberate way to match resources to strategy and
strategy to policy," the Office of Management and Budget wrote. "[Any
funding increase should be oriented to ensure the right balance of
forces essential to advancing modernization while sustaining
readiness]{.underline}."

**[Democrats and Republicans alike have]{.underline}** also **[rejected
the Navy's plans to decommission]{.underline}** [24 ships, 16 of them
ahead of schedule.]{.underline} [The White House]{.underline} statement
hit back at that, noting it "opposes" statutory requirements on the
minimum number of amphibious ships and that it ["strongly
opposes]{.underline} incrementally [funding a third Arleigh Burke class
destroyer in FY 2023."]{.underline}

Similarly, the House bill would also block the Air Force's request to
cut 33 Block 20 F-22A Raptor fighters.

[The White House also]{.underline} said it **["strongly
opposes"]{.underline}** [a provision that would provide \$45 million in
continued **funding for the sea-launched cruise missile nuclear
development program**, or SLCM-N,]{.underline} which Rep. Jim Cooper,
D-Tenn., introduced as an amendment when the House Armed Services
Committee voted 57-1 to advance the bill last month.

["Further investment in developing SLCM-N would divert resources and
focus from higher modernization priorities for the U.S. nuclear
enterprise and infrastructure, which is already stretched to
capacity]{.underline} after decades of deferred investments," the Office
of Management and Budget wrote.

However, [the fate of SLCM-N remains unclear]{.underline}, given the
House Appropriations Committee last month advanced a bill that would
defund the program.

[The White House]{.underline} also decried a provision that [would
prevent the Navy from retiring five littoral combat ships]{.underline}.
The service requested to retire nine of the vessels, citing breakdowns
among the fleet as well as a \$59 million annual maintenance cost.

Navy chief defends plan to scrap troubled warships even though some are

(CNN)[The chief of the US Navy defended the service\'s plans to scrap
nine]{.underline} relatively [new warships in the coming fiscal
year]{.underline} even as the service tries to keep up with China\'s
growing fleet. Three of the littoral combat ships slated for
decommissioning are less than three years old.

[Chief of Naval Operations Admiral]{.underline} Michael [Gilday told the
House Armed Services Committee]{.underline} Wednesday that the
**[anti-submarine ships could not perform their primary
mission]{.underline}**.

\"I refuse to put an additional dollar against a system that would not
be able to track a high-end submarine in today\'s environment,\" Gilday
told the committee. He said [the main reason for the early retirement
was that the anti-submarine warfare system on the ships \"did not work
out]{.underline} technically.\" The decommissioning of the ships would
save the Navy approximately \$391 million, according to the service\'s
proposed FY23 budget.

But that recoups only a fraction of the cost of the nine littoral combat
ships, which totaled about \$3.2 billion.

The USS Indianapolis, USS Billings and USS Wichita were all commissioned
in 2019, which means the Navy plans on decommissioning ships that are
only a fraction of the way into their expected service life. The Navy
also plans to retire six other littoral combat ships, all of the
single-hull Freedom-variant, as opposed to the trimaran
Independence-variant. Both variants can achieve speeds of 40+ knots.

Under a 2016 Navy plan, the Freedom-class variants were all homeported
Mayport, Florida, mainly for use in Atlantic Ocean operations. The
Independence-class variants were homeported in San Diego, and designated
for mainly Pacific operations.

[The decision amounts to an embarrassing admission that some of the
Navy\'s newest ships are not fit for modern warfare.]{.underline}

[Despite the Navy\'s plans to scrap the warships, **Congress has the
final say on the military budget and has balked at previous requests to
decommission ships**.]{.underline} [Reducing the number of warships may
be even more difficult as **lawmakers focus on the growing** size of
China\'s navy and the **gap between the US and Chinese
fleets.**]{.underline}

Washington --- [U.S.]{.underline} House [lawmakers]{.underline} debated
Wednesday whether to keep or retire a troubled class of warships that
includes the USS Detroit, ultimately [reject]{.underline}ing [a measure
that would have let the Navy retire nine of them.]{.underline}

[The amendment to the defense authorization bill]{.underline} by Armed
Services Chairman Adam Smith, D-Washington, [failed by a vote of
208-221]{.underline} late Wednesday, though that alone won\'t save the
USS Detroit from the scrap heap.

The House later approved [the underlying defense package]{.underline}
Thursday that [would permit the retirement of four Freedom-class
littoral combat ships but **block the Navy from decommissioning** five
others.]{.underline}

Smith argued none of the nine LCS ships are worth saving, even though
most are just a few years old, noting their \"significant\" maintenance
problems and operating costs. Also, [the **a**nti-**s**ubmarine
**w**arfare system made for them is **incapable** because it didn\'t fit
onto the Freedom-class ships]{.underline}.

\"These ships are not that old. They\'re not. But they have also not
turned out to perform the way they were expected,\" Smith said. \"[**The
Navy has determined that it is better to invest in newer**, more modern,
more capable **platforms, and we are blocking their ability to do
that**]{.underline}.\"

Rep. Rob [Whittman]{.underline}, R-Virginia, countered that getting rid
of the ships is wrong-headed, [pointing out the LCS\'s fast-attack and
mine-hunting capabilities and insisting they would be capable to counter
China\'s fleet.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- No Link -- Luria Shields

#### No link -- Luria fights for the Navy and protects Democratic majority, especially in light of Taiwan and midterms

**Gould 7/13** \-- senior Pentagon reporter for Defense News, covering
the intersection of national security policy, politics and the defense
industry. (Joe, "Elaine Luria wants to fight for a stronger Navy --- but

WASHINGTON --- [Rep. Elaine **Luria** is one of the U.S. **Navy's
staunchest proponents**]{.underline} --- and one of its most ruthless
critics.

Luria first drew attention in 2018 as one of seven Democrats with
national security backgrounds who flipped red House seats to blue. But
the Virginian at times finds herself aligned with Republicans, as she
champions defense spending hikes, even flatly saying earlier this year
President Joe [Biden's defense budget "sucks."]{.underline}

Now, the 46-year-old former Navy commander serving as the House Armed
Services Committee's vice chairwoman faces her toughest political battle
yet as she works to hold onto her seat this fall.

T[o Democrats, Luria is a pivotal player]{.underline} in their quest [to
maintain a majority in the House]{.underline} --- even as she finds
herself at odds with fellow members of her party. To shipbuilders and
sea power supporters, she's an ally; [to the Navy, she's both a
supporter and a skeptic]{.underline}. Last month, [she led a bipartisan
coalition to boost defense spending, and]{.underline} she often us[es
her military experience to grill officials on both the size and
readiness of the Navy's fleet, and whether those factors are sufficient
enough to win a war against China.]{.underline}

It's a role some Navy supporters say is much needed, as the service has
borne the fallout from budget fights since 9/11 that favored the
military branches closer to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Retired Navy Capt. Lory Manning, now the government relations director
of the Service Women's Action Network, said [Luria is helping the Navy
"make up for 20 years of being underfunded or
under-resourced."]{.underline}

"[We need people like her who]{.underline} really [know what they're
talking about with Navy ships because]{.underline} there's not that many
Navy officers in **[Congress]{.underline}**, and they **[need to know
they can't bullshit]{.underline}**," Manning said.

It's a focus Luria's betting will resonate in Virginia's 2nd District,
home to a high concentration of shipyard workers, service members,
veterans and their families. The district is adjacent to the Hampton
Roads area, whose local economy is tied to Naval Station Norfolk, home
of the most U.S. Navy personnel, and to Norfolk Naval Shipyard, which
services nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines on the East
Coast.

"I spend the majority of my time talking about defense and veterans
issues, and it affects everybody in my community," Luria, who also
serves on the House Veterans' Affairs and Homeland Security committees,
told Defense News during a June 24 interview in her office.

"The way I look at it is [if we don't get this right with defense,
especially with China's increased aggression against Taiwan, investing
in the right Navy]{.underline} and air [forces]{.underline}, [none of
the other stuff matters."]{.underline}

But [if voters regard their ballots as a choice between two political
parties]{.underline} --- one trying but failing, the other veering
dangerously toward extremism --- those **[losses could be
mitigated]{.underline}**. In the coming weeks --- with the Jan. 6
hearings, an expected overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court
and the new focus on gun violence --- [Democrats are hoping that choice
will be crystallized]{.underline}.

A new ABC News-Ipsos poll found that while [voters]{.underline} still
broadly [rate inflation and gas prices as huge issues]{.underline},
their single most important concerns are diffuse. Inflation was chosen
by 21 percent and the economy more broadly by 19 percent, but [gun
violence was the top priority of 17 percent and]{.underline} another [12
percent cited abortion.]{.underline}

The [Jan. 6 hearings could raise]{.underline} still [more **doubts about
returning power to the Republicans**]{.underline}, said Celinda Lake, a
Democratic pollster who has been conducting focus groups with swing
voters.

"People think it's part and parcel of a faction of [Republicans who are
just going way too far]{.underline}," she said of Jan. 6. Voters, she
added, "do have an ability to link it to other pieces of the agenda."

Ms. [Luria]{.underline}, who served as a naval officer for 20 years,
[is]{.underline} by no means making her service on the committee her
calling card for re-election. She said she was [most likely the only
Democratic incumbent campaigning on her fight to increase the budgets of
the Navy and the Air Force]{.underline}, while hitting Mr. Biden on
foreign policy.

On the campaign trail, [she is]{.underline} more [likely to be talking
about flood mitigation in Hampton Roads]{.underline}, the deepening of
[commercial shipping channels around Norfolk Harbor or the renaming of a
post office in Virginia Beach]{.underline} than her work on the Jan. 6
committee.

But **[like it or not, her role is getting notice]{.underline}**. As she
walked into a local eatery in Virginia Beach on Monday, [a young law
student was waiting to]{.underline} buttonhole her about price gouging
of infant formula and to [thank her for her efforts around the Capitol
attack.]{.underline}

"The other day, my husband was stopping to get a piece of pizza at
Costco for my daughter, and I went ahead and took the groceries out,"
Ms. Luria recalled. "He had three people come up to him after I walked
out, and they said, 'We didn't really want to bother Elaine, but please
[tell her thank you]{.underline}.'"

It is purely anecdotal, she admitted, but in her district, one in five
voters are either active-duty military or veterans. They took an oath to
defend the Constitution, and in 2020, [Virginia Beach]{.underline} voted
for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time since 1964.
They [care about the institutions of the United States and the fate of
its democratic traditions]{.underline}.

The **[Republicans]{.underline}** challenging Ms. Luria see it
differently, but they **[face their own divisions]{.underline}**. Jen
[Kiggans]{.underline}, a state senator and Navy veteran,
[is]{.underline} running as [a traditional Republican]{.underline} with

### 1AR -- No Link -- AT: Luria = Skeptic

#### Luria provides constructive criticism while garnering Republican support -- Navy budgets, Taiwan, and proposals prove

**Gould 7/13** \-- senior Pentagon reporter for Defense News, covering
the intersection of national security policy, politics and the defense
industry. (Joe, "Elaine Luria wants to fight for a stronger Navy --- but
first she has to get reelected," Defense News, 7-13-2022,

[Luria is one of the H]{.underline}ouse [A]{.underline}rmed
[S]{.underline}ervices [C]{.underline}ommittee['s most biting
inquirers,]{.underline} especially when it comes to Navy matters. Less
than a year into office, [she grilled service officials on complex
issues, often with]{.underline} coolly withering or [rapid-fire
questions]{.underline}, rarely glancing at her notes.

At a naval readiness hearing in 2019, Luria peppered the three-star
chief of Naval Sea Systems Command with questions about maintenance
delays for carriers.

Though Navy plans called for the carrier George H.W. Bush to sit in
drydock for 16 months of a 36-month cycle, Luria wanted to know why it
would instead take 28 months, forcing another carrier to extend its
deployment.

NAVSEA's commander said the Bush faced unique repair issues and that
Norfolk was overburdened by other work. Luria told him she'd talked to
the shipyard commander personally; the work didn't seem unique to her.

"Are you going to say it was successful if we complete it in 28 months,
or is it already a failure because it's 28 instead of 16, which it
should have been?" Luria asked pointedly.

The larger issue to her was that seven out of 11 Navy carriers were not
deployable, including the problem-plagued carrier Gerald R. Ford. [She
roasted that ship as "a \$13 billion nuclear-powered berthing
barge."]{.underline}

**[Luria has also regularly argued Navy officials do not advocate enough
for their service and budget.]{.underline}** [She has criticized the
Navy for backtracking on plans to build a 355-ship fleet]{.underline}.

For their part, service officials have said fleet size is not all that
matters. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday and Navy Secretary
Carlos Del Toro have, for example, tried to convince
[Congress]{.underline} to let the service decommission its old and
worn-out cruiser fleet, arguing the ships are irrelevant to future
fights, unsafe and a drag on the Navy's budget.

"They're [eating us alive in terms of our ability to get maintenance
back on track]{.underline}, which is where we need to be," Gilday said
at an industry event in March. "We are paying tens of millions of
dollars beyond what we expected to because of growth work and new work
on ships that are beyond their service life."

[To be clear, Luria]{.underline} hasn't called for a specific number of
ships; she [agrees]{.underline} with the sort of aim Michèle Flournoy
--- former undersecretary of defense for policy --- has espoused, [that
the U.S should be able to "credibly threaten to sink all of China's
military vessels, submarines, and merchant ships in the South China Sea
within 72 hours."]{.underline}

"With such a defined goal, w[e could design a fleet not based on size,
but based on capability," Luria said]{.underline} in 2020. "[Deterrence
must be credible]{.underline} and is only effective when an adversary
believes, through our daily actions, that the cost of their armed
aggression will be met with such overwhelming force (damage) that the
loss would be too extreme for the benefit."

Hawkish on China

Republicans in Washington have sought to paint Democrats as weak on
China, but it's hard to draw a line between those Republicans and Luria,
who has called on the Biden administration to end U.S. ambiguity about
whether it would defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack.

[When Navy officials appeared on Capitol Hill last year to defend plans
to decommission 15 ships, Luria was among lawmakers who pointed to
assessments from two successive Indo-Pacific Command chiefs that China
wants to be able to seize Taiwan by 2027]{.underline}. Beijing considers
the island a breakaway province and has vowed to incorporate it back
into the mainland, by force if necessary.

The U.S. Navy's focus on the future, Luria and other lawmakers said,
would leave it too small to face that fast approaching threat.

"We're looking at this [Battle Force 2045]{.underline}, a plan that's
[far off]{.underline}, a 355-ship goal that we're never going to get to
when we decommission more ships every year than we actually build. ...
What are we going to do in 2025 to counter this threat?" Luria asked.
"We're creating a gap, and I'm afraid that the Chinese will find a way
to exploit that gap."

When this year's budget proposal aimed to retire 24 ships, Luria made
headlines in April for calling it out in a Twitter thread that invoked
Taiwan.

"The Navy owes a public apology to American taxpayers for wasting tens
of billions of dollars on ships they now say serve no purpose," she
said, adding the Navy has "NO PLAN" to replace lost firepower quickly
enough to make a difference against China. "Lastly, the Navy has no
strategy. Stop saying you do, because if you did you would be able to
explain how this Fleet size will allow us to defend Taiwan."

[Luria]{.underline} followed up with a lengthy analysis published by the
Center for International Maritime Security that [decried the
"catastrophic loss" of firepower]{.underline} she said would result from
that budget.

According to Luria's number crunching, those plans would translate into
a loss of MK 41 Vertical Launching System cells, which fire a variety of
missiles. She forecast a loss of 756 cells by 2024, 1,668 cells by 2027
and 1,980 by 2035.

To convince China it can't outgun the U.S. and its allies in the Pacific
region, Luria offered several options, including keeping and extending
the lives of 12 cruisers, refitting expeditionary fast transport ships
with a 64-cell capacity, and building eight additional ships.

**[That approach has won her plaudits from some
Republicans]{.underline}**.

Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher, a former Marine intelligence officer on
the House Armed Services Committee, is a frequent collaborator. Also a
China and sea power hawk, Gallagher was Luria's co-sponsor on an
amendment to establish a congressional commission to review the Navy's
force structure plans.

"She's really knowledgeable and wants to build a bigger Navy," said
Gallagher, crediting her as the committee's most vocal member about the
Navy's shrinking firepower. "I feel like we've done a billion amendments
together."

Luria's budget inspiration stems from the Reagan administration.
Then-Navy Secretary John Lehman's 600-ship plan was meant to signal
strength to the Soviet Union. [As Luria sees it, the Democrat-run White
House no longer grasps the urgency of a bigger naval budget, and the
Navy's not helping its own case.]{.underline}

"The administration was not prioritizing this with that sense of urgency
and view, so I just continue to be loud about it," Luria said. "I know
that it's frustrating to people in the administration that here you have
a Democrat just continuously criticizing the administration on
defense-related things."

The previous Republican administration said "the right words," she
added, when then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper unveiled plans to boost
the Navy's fleet to 500 manned and unmanned ships by 2045, and a fleet
of 355 traditional battle force ships by 2035.

Still, in October 2020, it came too late, she said.

"It was a commitment to an investment," [Luria said. "It needs to come
from the top ... and I just don't feel like it's been high enough of a
priority."]{.underline}

Though Biden has signed a flurry of executive orders that seek to revive
America's manufacturing and industrial base, [the Navy's budget
submission is out of step and doesn't offer any certainty of consistent
work for shipbuilders, according to Luria]{.underline}.

"[If we really want to make a commitment to grow the industrial base,
**we have to send a steady demand signal about what we are going to
build**]{.underline}," she said.

### 2AC -- No Link -- Bipartisan Report

#### No link -- Congress has called on the DoD to win the AI race to counter Russia and China -- tech development, budget spending, and military integration

has been covering military issues since 2009. (Hope Hedge, "Congress
Wants a \'Manhattan Project\' for Military Artificial Intelligence,"

A new [**bipartisan congressional report calls for the Defense
Department to get** a lot more **serious about the race to acquire
artificial intelligence** and autonomous capabilities]{.underline},
modeling efforts to become dominant in these spheres after the
\"Manhattan Project\" initiative to test and develop nuclear weapons in
the 1940s.

On Tuesday, the House Armed Services Committee released the results of a
yearlong review, co-led by Reps. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., and Jim Banks,
R-Ind., aimed at assessing U.S. military capabilities and preparedness
to meet current threats. The 87-page Future of Defense Task Force Report
contains some expected findings \-- [China and Russia are]{.underline}
identified as [the top security threats to the U.S. and modernization is
described as an urgent need]{.underline} \-- but there are surprising
points of emphasis.

[The report leans hard into technological development and growth,
particularly in the fields of machine learning and
autonomy]{.underline}, going so far as to call for the [Defense
Department]{.underline} to [evaluate an AI]{.underline} or autonomous
[alternative prior to every major future defense buy.]{.underline} And
it also calls for the military to treat these technologies like a
game-changing new weapon, establishing clear rules of the road and
guardrails for their use.

\"[Using the Manhattan Project as a model, **the U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [**must undertake and win the** artificial
intelligence **race by leading in the invention and deployment of
AI**]{.underline} while establishing the standards for its public and
private use,\" the report\'s authors wrote. \"Although the Department of
Defense has increased investment in AI and established the Joint
Artificial Intelligence Center to assist with the transition and
deployment of AI capabilities, cultural resistance to its wider adoption
remains. Congress and the Department of Defense must take additional
action to overcome these barriers.\"

The Manhattan Project, undertaken from 1942 to 1947, was a U.S.-led
effort to obtain and test a nuclear bomb, a world-changing enterprise
that led to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, at the end of
World War II.

The task force report emphasizes that, now as then, the United States is
against the clock to obtain and master tools that could make or break
future dominance. It noted that China has publicly set the goal of
becoming the world\'s leading AI power by 2030, just a decade from now.

In addition to considering AI or autonomous alternatives for new
[DoD]{.underline} acquisitions, the task force recommended that the
Pentagon be [required to make all new major purchases AI-ready and able
to \"nest with existing]{.underline} and planned [joint all-domain
c]{.underline}ommand [and c]{.underline}ontrol [networks.\"]{.underline}
It also called for the DoD to be given greater authority to evaluate
advanced technologies that might accomplish military objectives better
and at a lower cost.

To back up this push for innovation, [the task force called for a
requirement that the military services each spend at least 1% of their
budgets on the integration of new technology.]{.underline}

In concert with this effort, the task force said, the U.S. should lead
efforts to draft and approve an international treaty with rules for the
civilian and military use of AI. That treaty, it said, should be \"in
the vein of the Geneva Conventions, the Chemical Weapons Convention, and
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,\" with a goal of having all
nations that plan to develop and use AI sign on.

As the U.S. military invests in leap-ahead technologies, it must also
divest aggressively from old and outdated programs, the task force said.
In 2030, the report\'s authors noted, a \"staggering\" 70% of military
capabilities will still consist of legacy systems, according to current
projections.

To cut all the dead weight, the lawmakers recommended that Congress
commission Rand Corp. or a similar organization to study existing legacy
platforms and determine their continued relevance over the next
half-century.

\"Following completion of the studies, [a panel should be convened,
comprising Congress, the D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f
[D]{.underline}efense, [and representatives]{.underline} from the
industrial base, [to make recommendations on which platforms should be
retired, replaced or recapitalized]{.underline},\" they said.

And along with technology, the task force said, the military must
modernize its aging personnel policies and infrastructure and attract
fresh talent. It incorporated some of the recent recommendations from
the National Commission on Military, National and Public Service,
calling for more volunteer opportunities; greater incentives for
military service, including student loan deferment and forgiveness; and
the creation of paid year-of-service programs \-- military, civilian and
private-sector \-- for young people.

\"[Although the U.S. military personnel system produces outstanding
leaders, it must grow its ability to produce more service members with
expanded capabilities to meet emerging threats]{.underline},\" the task
force wrote. \"History repeatedly shows that [technological superiority
does not guarantee victory]{.underline} and that [new ways of thinking
can be more powerful than new weapons]{.underline}.

\"**[Future leaders]{.underline}** and strategists [**will need to
embrace emerging warfighting concepts** such as joint and multi-domain
warfare]{.underline}. [They will]{.underline} further [need a
comprehensive understanding of national power **and how to integrate
military tools** into a whole-of-government effort]{.underline},\" it
added.

### 2AC -- No Link -- Congress Wants Nukes

\*I think this is answered by "2NC -- L -- Infighting"

[The House Armed Services Committee]{.underline} (HASC) [added an
amendment to the 2023 military budget that would]{.underline} continue
to [fund the development of sea-launched nuclear cruise
missiles]{.underline}. This [despite]{.underline} [the Navy's own budget
zeroing out the item]{.underline}, saying it didn't need the nukes, and
the Biden White House saying the weapons were unnecessary.

The HASC amendment is [\$45 million dollars]{.underline} and Rep. Jim
Cooper of Tennessee sees it as [a compromise option]{.underline} between
people who want the program cut entirely and those who want it
bolstered. "[We all know there are lots of pros and cons about actually
deploying these on attack submarines]{.underline}," Cooper said,
according to Breaking Defense. "[No one can tell]{.underline} in an
uncertain world [what we will need, but it's important to keep this
option available]{.underline}."

The program would create a nuclear sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM-N).
At the moment, the only U.S. nukes at sea are in submarines. These new
cruise missiles could be launched from the decks of ships. It's not the
first time the United States has sailed the seas armed with nuclear
cruise missiles, it first deployed them in the mid 1980s. George H.W.
Bush ordered the dissolution of the missiles after the end of the Cold
War. Obama followed up in 2010 by recommending the missiles be retired
entirely, a task the Navy completed in 2013.

[In its budget request for]{.underline} the fiscal year of [2023, the
Navy zeroed out the line referring to the program, effectively asking to
kill it]{.underline}. According to a Congressional Research Service
report on the issue, the cancellation would save \$2.1 billion over five
years. "The Navy indicated that [the program was 'cost prohibitive and
the acquisition schedule would have delivered capability late to
need]{.underline},'" the report said.

The Biden Nuclear Posture Review---an official White House report that
outlines how an administration plans to develop and deploy nuclear
weapons---allegedly supported the decision. The review is complete but
hasn't been publicly released, but people who've read it have told
journalists that it supported canceling the SLCM-N. "Really this
decision came out of the Nuclear Posture Review," an official told
Breaking Defense. "There was direction from the president to reduce the
role of nuclear weapons in our defense strategy. That \[decision to
cancel SLCM-N\] was a component.

Now the HASC has injected \$45 million into the flagging program. [The
Senate Armed Services Committee also authorized]{.underline} spending
[\$25 million to]{.underline} continue to [develop nuclear cruise
missiles that the Navy and Biden don't want]{.underline}. [The two
groups will come together soon to settle on a final number]{.underline}
and there is a chance that they'll decide to cut the program.

[There's been a push in recent years for the U.S. to develop new and
more "tactical" nuclear weapons]{.underline}. This typically means
lower-yield weapons that could be, the argument goes, used in al limited
nuclear war. The Trump administration actually deployed these
lower-yield nukes on submarines in 2020. [It's hard to know if China or
Russia would accept the logic that a "low-yield" nuke is less
provocative than a typical nuclear weapon.]{.underline}

[Progressives]{.underline} were **[already disappointed]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline} President Joe [Biden's plans for the nation's nuclear
arsenal.]{.underline} [Now they're poised to lose one of the few things
about the]{.underline} White House's blueprint [that they
liked.]{.underline}

In recent weeks, [Democrats have joined Republicans in adding money back
into the Pentagon budget to continue developing a sea-launched nuclear
cruise missile]{.underline} that former President Donald Trump initiated
in 2018. [Biden]{.underline} proposed [canceling the
missile]{.underline}, which arms control advocates say [is redundant,
costly and potentially destabilizing.]{.underline}

Yet [testimony from top military leaders]{.underline}, including Joint
Chiefs Chair Gen. Mark Milley, [in support of the missile prompted other
**Democrats** to **join Republicans in rebuking Biden's
plans**]{.underline}.

"No one can tell in an uncertain world what we will need, but it's
important to keep this option available," Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), who
authored the House proposal to keep the missile, explained during a
committee markup in June.

[The Pentagon's still-classified Nuclear Posture Review]{.underline},
which lays out a long-term roadmap for the nuclear arsenal, [spurred the
decision to zero out funding for the missile in Biden's most recent
budget]{.underline}. The public split between top civilians and military
commanders amounted to a "green light" for Democrats to hedge on the
program, according to Tom Collina, policy director at Ploughshares Fund.

"If the president was making \[the missile\] a high priority, he'd tell
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to oppose the \[missile\],"
Collina said. "So I think [the administration made a decision that this
simply wasn't a high priority for them]{.underline}."

"[Once you have the administration saying one thing and the military
brass saying something else, in this case, supporting continued
development of the \[missile\]]{.underline} ... then **[you're not going
to have the Democrats falling in line behind the system]{.underline}**,"
he said.

[The situation marks a retreat from]{.underline} the campaign pledges of
then-candidate [Biden, who]{.underline} long [advocated for reducing
reliance on nuclear weapons, only to turn around and dedicate tens of
billions of dollars to the modernization of all three legs of the triad
for two years in a row]{.underline}. Arms control advocates also called
on him to establish a "no first use" policy and cancel two weapons added
on by the Trump administration: the cruise missile and a low-yield
submarine-launched missile, which has already entered the fleet.

Biden's nuclear plans, outlined in a brief summary released in March,
omit a "no first use" policy. The low-yield warhead introduced during
the Trump years remains a part of the arsenal.

As for the cruise missile, now that both the House and Senate Armed
Services committees have authorized funding, albeit with differing
conditions, [Congress will likely send Biden a compromise defense policy
bill this year that foils his plan to cancel the program]{.underline}.

The New York Times recently published a [poll]{.underline} that [marks
an exclamation point on months of bad news for the rapidly faltering
Biden presidency.]{.underline} [Biden's meager 33% approval
rating]{.underline} is in line with other polls, [but the
shocking]{.underline} and worrying [number]{.underline} for the White
House [is that]{.underline} fully **[64% of Democrats believe he should
not run for another term in 2024]{.underline}**. [That number rises to
an absurd 94% among Democrats under 30.]{.underline}

While younger voters have consistently given Biden lower marks than
other cohorts this year, that number now stands at a miserable 19%.
Y[oung voters are not a group that can be ignored as flighty non-voters:
they are the backbone of the Democratic party's recent
wins.]{.underline} In 2020, the youth vote surged to record numbers, and
young voters gave Biden a 24-point margin. [Without both high turnout
and high margins from young voters, Biden would have easily lost every
swing state.]{.underline} Increased turnout among the young also
provided much of the margin for Democrats in the 2018 midterms.

**[Biden's low approvals]{.underline}**, especially among the young,
**[have caused a crisis in confidence]{.underline}** [not
seen]{.underline} in a sitting president's party [since]{.underline} at
least [Jimmy Carter]{.underline}. Should Biden step down in 2024?
[Unless the administration and the Democratic party radically change
posture, he may need to retire to prevent the election of a man who only
last year attempted a coup]{.underline}. Most importantly, though, he
has within his power the chance to turn his presidency around.

It's clear to Americans of all political stripes that we are in a
crisis. Many of the basic rights and principles of our democracy have
been completely overruled by a party that hasn't won the popular vote in
a presidential election in 18 years. There is a massive disconnect
between the will of the people and the actions of the state. This is a
situation unprecedented since the Civil Rights Era or potentially even
Reconstruction, but the president has not treated it as such.
Fundamentally, people, especially **[young people]{.underline}**,
**[want to feel like the president is fighting for them]{.underline}**.

The [Biden]{.underline} administration [and]{.underline} the leadership
of [the]{.underline} federal D[emocratic party seem dedicated to broken
and undemocratic institutions.]{.underline} Given the power these
institutions are wielding, this feels hopelessly out of touch. The
primary solution offered by the Administration has been to show up to
vote in the midterms to potentially codify Roe, or more likely, stave
off a federal abortion ban by the Republican party. [None of the
solutions proposed even come close to addressing the
situation]{.underline}.

[This is **asymmetrical warfare**]{.underline}, with the Democrats
playing by an entirely different set of rules. While the Democrats
remain dedicated to antiquated institutions and procedures, [the
Republican party has remade the state in its image without even
commanding a majority of voters]{.underline}. The Republican party has
long wanted to undermine many of America's institutions: numerous
serious presidential candidates, sitting senators, and sitting judges
have proposed repealing the 14th amendment (the foundation of modern
American law), the 16th amendment creating the income tax, the 17th
amendment directly electing Senators, and more. [Democrats have
not]{.underline} seriously [countered at all]{.underline}. They are
dedicated to playing by the rules of a game everyone has long since
stopped playing.

The primary response to the rollback of several fundamental rights has
been "vote and donate". Voting is of course necessary, and so are
donations and all sorts of political activism. That doesn't make it less
insulting. People have voted. The last two elections have seen record
turnout for Democrats. The party has unified control of government,
despite all the caveats. The problem is, in the current system, voting
will not work, and people know that.

[It would take decades of uninterrupted Democratic control of the
presidency to flip the US supreme court.]{.underline} With the current
coalitions and political structure, [it's effectively impossible for
Democrats to ever win a filibuster-proof majority in the
Senate.]{.underline} [Even a simple governing majority requires a clear
Democratic wave in the popular vote, and that majority would almost
certainly require more red-state Democrats like Sinema and Manchin who
would block legislation]{.underline}.

In short, "just vote" and using the current institutions is impossible,
and voters recognize that. [It is not possible to win back the right to
abortion, basic environmental protection, schools free of religious
indoctrination, basic regulation on guns,]{.underline} protect rights to
contraception[, marriage equality, and personal sexual activity without
radical changes to the basic structure of American
governance.]{.underline}

Winning elections doesn't hurt anything, but it is not enough in an
anti-democratic system that has been gamed to truly absurd extents.
[**There's no winning** in this system, **and that is apparent
to**]{.underline} most Americans, and to the vast majority of **[young
Americans who disapprove of Biden]{.underline}**. To rescue his
presidency, and mobilize a real force at the midterms and in the future,
[Biden needs to boldly champion radical democratic reforms]{.underline},
use his power and dare the supreme court and the Senate to stop him.

While in other times, disempowering institutions and taking unilateral
action as a president may be unpopular, Americans recognize that our
system is utterly broken. The supreme court has approval of only 25% of
the populace, by far the lowest measured. This is an institution that
can exercise power only so long as it has buy-in from the people.
Supermajorities support serious reforms to the supreme court.

[Young Americans]{.underline} in particular see their future collapsing
before their eyes and understand the stakes. They [know Biden can't
unilaterally pack the court, or make any significant reforms to the
legislative or judiciary.]{.underline} That's beside the point, however;
he needs to put this on the agenda. He has been faced with a crisis of
legitimacy, where the vast majority of the people vocally oppose the
order being imposed on them. He has to stand with the people and lead
the charge for their rights. There's no way through these rigged
institutions. Only around. To save his presidency, this needs to be at
the very forefront of his agenda.

Biden needs to reverse course and show aggression as soon as possible to
counter the lackluster response to Dobbs that has damaged his standing
among Democrats and the young. Americans know the president doesn't have
this unilateral power, though they know he can do more. Most of all they
want a fight. They want to know that the president recognizes the
gravity of the crisis . We've seen the most serious rollback in rights
for American citizens since Plessy v Ferguson in 1896. [The majority of
Americans are under attack by a minority, and they need a president who
recognizes this and will respond in kind.]{.underline}

Biden has the opportunity to change course and be a two-term president
who righted the country in a crisis of democracy. If Biden can't do
this, he will need to be replaced. Not only because it's necessary, but
because it's the only way to recover his popularity and win reelection.

[The Democratic party must reorient itself around radical democratic
reforms and disempowering the supreme court, the Senate, and state
governments.]{.underline} This is both necessary and inevitable. If
Biden doesn't do it, the next Democrat will need to. If they don't, it
will be impossible to exercise power of any sort, no matter the opinions
of citizens.

Anti-democratic government institutions are fundamentally reshaping
society and people have no recourse without a radical change. As a
smaller and smaller minority exert more and more power, something has to
come to a head. A state cannot operate so unmoored from popular
sovereignty without a real rupture. Modern governments rely on at least
some degree of consent of the governed.

There is no future where the Democratic party doesn't embrace serious
reforms to the current constitutional order, because [**radical
resistance to the anti-democratic onslaught is required** for their
continued existence as a party]{.underline}. [If Biden wants to lead the
country, he must take the lead.]{.underline} Without an aggressive and
radical reposturing, he will be unable to recover his standing. Nearly
all Americans understand the country is in a crisis that requires a
radical reshaping of our institutions. The Republicans are leading it.
[**Biden is a man out of step with the world** around him unless he
recognizes this and acts decisively.]{.underline}

### L -- Biotech Investment

#### Biotech investment draws political controversy -- picking favorites perceived as undermine public efforts and a corporate handout

**Servick 19** \[Kelly Servick is a staff writer at Science,
\"Controversial U.S. bill would lift Supreme Court ban on patenting
human genes\", Science,
https://www.science.org/content/article/controversial-us-bill-would-lift-supreme-court-ban-patenting-human-genes\]
GBS-HW

[**A** congressional **proposal that would** overturn a landmark U.S.
Supreme Court decision that barred the patenting of human genes and
**ease** other **restrictions on** patenting software and **bio**medical
**inventions is drawing fierce criticism** from some scientific
societies and patient advocates.]{.underline} Yesterday, the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in Washington, D.C., along with more than
100 other signatories from research institutes and advocacy groups,
released a letter to lawmakers arguing the changes would stifle medical
research and hinder patients\' access to diagnostic tests.

[**The** draft **bill \"would result in a quagmire of patent claims**
and legal impediments to the normal scientific exchange,\" said Harold
Varmus, a cancer biologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City
and former director of the National Cancer Institute, in a press
conference yesterday. \"It\'s in the interest of virtually everyone to
keep ideas and basic discoveries about the laws and products of nature
in the public domain.\"]{.underline}

The ACLU letter comes as the Senate Committee on the Judiciary kicks off
the first in a series of three hearings that will examine potential
changes to U.S. patent law. Today\'s hearing is expected to include
discussion of the draft proposal, released last month by a bipartisan
group of lawmakers, which would overturn current restrictions on
patenting products and processes that occur in nature, including human
genes.

[The bill aims to address a complaint that has been brewing for years in
the biotechnology and software industries: that recent Supreme Court
decisions have created confusing and overly stringent patent eligibility
rules.]{.underline} In particular, critics point to three recent
rulings:

The 2012 decision in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus
Laboratories invalidated a patent on adjusting drug dosage based on
levels of metabolites in a patient\'s blood because it relied on a \"law
of nature.\"

The landmark 2013 ruling in Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) v.
Myriad Genetics Inc. said that human genes can\'t be patented because
they are a \"product of nature.\"

In 2014, software patents took a blow from the Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank
International decision, which found a financial trading program to be an
unpatentable \"abstract idea.\"

The new bill \"makes it clear in no uncertain terms that all the Supreme
Court \[decisions\] are just gone,\" says Arti Rai, a patent law expert
at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. It says decisions about
patent eligibility should not rely on \"judicially created exceptions
... including 'abstract ideas,\' 'laws of nature,\' or 'natural
phenomena.\'\"

The bill\'s sponsors in the Senate, Thom Tillis (R--NC) and Chris Coons
(D--DE), have described it as a way to restore incentives for U.S.
innovation by making the process for protecting new inventions more
predictable. (Competition with China, where no comparable restrictions
exist in the patent system, may have motivated the lawmakers, Rai says.)

[But **opponents say the bill would enable monopolies on discoveries
that should be widely available for research and medical
use**.]{.underline} In the 2013 Myriad case, the diagnostic company
Myriad Genetics of Salt Lake City claimed that its broad patents on two
human genes gave it exclusive rights to clinical tests for
cancer-associated mutations in those genes. In striking down the
patents, the Supreme Court allowed other diagnostic companies to offer
such tests without fear of infringement lawsuits. [Signatories on the
new letter---including plaintiffs who challenged the Myriad patents, and
ACLU, which represented them---argue that if the proposed law is
enacted, \"We will again see high prices for tests with no competition
in the market.\"]{.underline}

#### Biotech investment\-\--congress has [backed off]{.underline} BECAUSE of fears of [inflation]{.underline} and [price controls]{.underline}

**Alex Keown**, 6-15-**2022**, Keown is a journalist for Biospace with
20 years of experience in the field of biotechnology \"Biotech Industry
Seeks Congressional Greenlight for NOL Sales,\" BioSpace,
https://www.biospace.com/article/biotech-industry-seeks-congressional-greenlight-for-nol-sales-as-source-of-income//DG

The San Francisco Business Times reported that [industry lobbyists
are [urging Congress to approve a
plan](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2022/06/14/net-operating-losses-nol-tax-credit-biotech.html)]{.underline} that
will [allow companies]{.underline} that are not yet generating revenue
from the sales of their assets [to be allowed to sell net operating
loss]{.underline} carryforwards to larger companies. In other words, the
biotech companies are looking to sell their losses to larger companies
to provide them with a tax credit that would allow them to lower their
tax burden.   Currently, net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards allow
businesses that have suffered financial losses within a fiscal year to
deduct them from profits in future years. This will enable businesses to
be taxed on average profitability. The [plan floated by biotech
leaders]{.underline} would certainly be appealing to some of the larger
companies. As the Business Times explained, NOL carryforwards are
attractive to merger and acquisition specialists because of their
practical applications in decreasing tax burdens. But, those are NOLs
that are gained through an acquisition. The current plan seeks to give
small companies the ability to sell those losses on the open market
without going through the M&A process.  If a company gains a commercial
revenue stream, it can take up to a decade and hundreds of millions of
dollars in revenue that can offset those net operating losses.  While
the sale of NOLs is not an option across the country as a whole, there
are places where the practice is already in place. For years, the state
of New Jersey has allowed tech and life sciences companies to sell up to
\$20 million in state net operating losses or R&D tax credits to buyers,
which the purchasers can use to reduce taxable income. California has
also reinstated the sale of NOLs as the state faced a budget deficit of
\$34 billion. It appears to have been successful as the state is now
projected to have a surplus. **[But, at the federal level, the idea of
NOL sales has not seen much movement]{.underline}**.  This plan would
allow early-stage companies with a new source of capital, mainly if they
have been unsuccessful at finding significant funding from venture
capitalists. The Business Times report comes the same day that Third
Rock Ventures announced a new \$1.1 billion fund aimed at supporting
startup companies. The approach would provide a new source of funding
for these early-stage companies. The supporters of the plan also noted
that larger companies would benefit through a new tax-reduction tool. 
The Business Times speculated that these NOLs are worth hundreds of
millions of dollars. If the carryforward sale is allowed, the [biotech
industry hopes this could also serve as a catalyst for
investors]{.underline} to return to supporting these early-stage
companies to drive the development of new therapies, diagnostics and
medical devices.  Investors have largely [backed away from biotech and
pharma over the past year due to market uncertainty caused by inflation,
supply chain disruptions, the ongoing war in Ukraine and continuing
talks about drug price controls.]{.underline} Since the start of the
year, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has been down nearly 30%.

stating annual EpiPen price hikes were justified due to ongoing R&D
costs (strike one), discounted public school rates (strike two), and
Obamacare\'s failed incentive structure (strike three). Unsurprisingly,
the aforementioned rationale didn\'t resonate with middle-class voters.
The [American public had quickly reached a populous
conclusion]{.underline}, which also established a dangerous precedent:

who is on Katko's SICI legislation and is ranking member of the
committee's cybersecurity panel, asked CISA Executive Director Eric
Goldstein to speak to the importance of CISA's voluntary approach in
working with the private sector. Katko also noted, regarding CISA's work
with the private sector: "We can\'t lose sight of the value of those
voluntary relationships." Clarke, in contrast, said, "[I think [it\'s
time to be candid about the limits of these voluntary partnerships and
authorities]{.mark} ...]{.underline} The throughline for all these
efforts, is that at some point, Congress or the administration, or both,
decided to punt on the question of benefits and burdens. That will not
happen on my watch.\" "[[There are conflicting opinions]{.mark} between
my colleagues and myself [on the right direction for SICI]{.mark},"
Katko acknowledged. Testifying before the committee, the Government
Accountability Office's Tina Won Sherman said, "The diffuse and

#### DoD cybersecurity programs are contentious---spurs backlash from businesses due to confusion.

still faces 'a lot of ambiguity\' around CMMC implementation,\"
FedScoop,
https://www.fedscoop.com/industry-still-faces-a-lot-of-ambiguity-around-cmmc-implementation//brian

[[Federal c]{.mark}ontractors still [face]{.mark} a lot of [unknowns
about]{.mark}]{.underline} [how the]{.underline} [Pentagon's
**[controversial Cybersecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline} Maturity Model
Certification [[program]{.underline}]{.mark} [will be
implemented]{.underline}, the head of a leading trade association told
lawmakers Tuesday. The [CMMC]{.underline} program [is an effort to
prod]{.underline} the [defense industrial base to improve]{.underline}
their [cybersecurity with new]{.underline} certification-based
[standards and]{.underline} better [protect]{.underline} controlled
unclassified [information from adversaries]{.underline}. After
[[receiving major pushback]{.mark} from contractors
[about]{.mark}]{.underline} [the [burdens and cost of
implementation]{.underline}]{.mark} [and conducting an internal
review,]{.underline} the **[D]{.underline}**epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[D]{.underline}**efense in November announced
that it was **[revamp]{.underline}**ing [its plans and would eventually
implement]{.underline} what it called [CMMC 2.0.]{.underline}
Additionally, earlier this year Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks
moved responsibility for the program from the Pentagon's acquisition and
sustainment office to the Office of the CIO. "The requirements are in
the early stages of the rulemaking process. And so we anticipate a
revised Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to ... come
out. We've heard various estimates that it could be as early as late
this spring or as late as a year from now," David Berteau, president and
CEO of the Professional Services Council, said during a Senate Armed
Services Committee hearing on the health of the defense industrial base.
He continued: "[What we don't know is, **[what's the next
standard]{.mark}** we're gonna have [to comply with]{.mark}? **[What's
the timeline]{.mark}** in which]{.underline} the [flag will go down and
you've got [to be in compliance]{.mark}? And what can you do now to be
ready for that when you don't know]{.underline} ... [what standards
you're gonna have to meet?]{.underline} So, **[[there's still a lot of
ambiguity]{.mark} there]{.underline}."** [**[Delays]{.mark}** in the
program [have implications]{.mark}]{.underline} for cybersecurity, he
noted. "One of the problems or concerns that we've raised from the
beginning is the threat is not waiting for this implementation, if you
will, and every day that threat grows," he said. "The [real question is,
[do]{.mark} those standards go far enough in order to
protect]{.underline} us [against the evolving threat?]{.underline} And
[nobody really knows the answer]{.underline} to that." CMMC 2.0 is
intended to simplify the standards, minimize barriers to compliance,
provide additional clarity on regulatory, policy and contracting
requirements, increase department oversight of "professional and ethical
standards in the assessment ecosystem," and improve the overall ease of
execution, according to a DOD press release issued in November. Key
changes include a reduction in the number of security compliance levels
from five to three, and a reduction in the number of contractors that
will be required to get third-party verification of their compliance.
The DOD plans to specify a baseline number of requirements that must be
achieved by contractors prior to contract award. CMMC won't be
implemented until after the completion of the rulemaking process for the
Code of Federal Regulations and the Defense Federal Acquisition
Regulation Supplement. However, the Pentagon has encouraged contractors
to beef up their cybersecurity while the rulemaking is underway. Berteau
noted that many contractors are already moving to come into compliance
with the cybersecurity standards laid out in National Institute of
Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-171 (NIST SP 800-171),
which are expected to inform CMMC. "Almost every company I know and that
participates in the defense business today at the prime contractor
level, whether large, medium or small, is already investing and has a
plan on record for compliance with and meeting those standards," Berteau
said. "It's not being incorporated into contracts \[now as part of
CMMC\] ... but a lot of people are moving forward anyway."

[The bipartisan infrastructure [bill]{.mark} and the Democrats' \$1.75

Senior [House [Democrats and Republicans disagree on]{.mark}
legislation]{.underline} Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., has proposed [that
calls on the Department of Homeland Security t]{.underline}o identify
"systemically important critical infrastructure"---SICI---for
prioritizing the government's efforts to [improve [the nation's
cybersecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}.    "It is not enough to simply
identify these most critical entities, nor is it consistent with what
the solarium Commission proposed," Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., chair of
the House Homeland Security Committee's panel on cybersecurity,
infrastructure protection and innovation, said during a hearing
Wednesday. "We need to be able to answer the question, 'what do these
companies need to do as a result of their designation?' And 'what does
the federal government need to do for them?'"  The [Katko
bill](https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2021/10/national-cyber-adviser-lays-out-goals-upcoming-30-nation-meeting-ransomware/185867/),
and identical legislation proposed by Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, in the
upper chamber, draws from a recommendation of the congressionally
mandated Cyberspace Solarium Commission. The commission, which was
composed of members of Congress from across the political spectrum,
executive-branch officials and major private-sector representatives,
proposed that entities designated systemically important critical
infrastructure be allowed some protection from liability and access to
information in exchange for implementing appropriate cybersecurity
controls.  Katko is ranking member of the House Homeland Security
Committee. His legislation, which has [a Democratic
co-sponsor](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5491/cosponsors?r=39&s=1)--Rep.
Abigail Spanberger, D-Va.---who has not been active on cybersecurity
policy, covers the first part of the Solarium Commission's bargain by
calling on DHS to identify the entities and outlining benefits they
would receive. But it does [not approach a discussion of appropriate
security controls]{.underline} companies should be required to
implement.  CISA, meanwhile, has made a point of noting the agency is
taking on the work of identifying the entities in question, regardless
of whether there is legislation instructing them to do so.  "It\'s clear
that CISA\'s Systemically Important Entities effort is engaged in a
rigorous identification process, but the next steps of what to do with
the list appear less clear to me than the Solarium Commission\'s vision
of SICI, which calls for specific benefits and obligations to SICI
entities," Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., said. Langevin chairs a key
cybersecurity panel on the House Armed Services Committee and is
co-chair of the House Cybersecurity Caucus. He and King were both
members of the Solarium Commission**[.     [Agreement]{.mark} also

### New Agency Link

#### Cybersecurity is notoriously problematic in politics -- only solution is to sacrifice limited political capital. 

**Newmeyer '12** - Adjunct Faculty at Excelsior College and the
Inter-American Defense College (Kevin P. Newmeyer, "Who Should Lead U.S.
Cybersecurity Efforts?," Prism Vol. 3, Issue 2, 03/01/2012)\
[The [challenges to a new department are daunting]{.mark}. Starting
something in Washington at the Cabinet level normally [requires]{.mark}
a dramatic trigger event along the lines of 9/11 or an indefatigable
champion [willing to expend the political capital necessary to carry the
battle]{.mark}. To date, this has [not occurred on]{.mark} the
[cyber]{.mark} front]{.underline}. Other issues have occupied the
political space and pushed cybersecurity to the rear. [A new department
would [also face significant growing pains]{.mark}. In the current
budget and political climate, it is [unlikely to garner the
support]{.mark} needed in Congress. While it may provide the best
operational and constitutional solution, it is the least likely in the
near to mid term.]{.underline} Retaining cybersecurity leadership within
the Department of Homeland Security is the most likely alternative among
the Cabinet level organizations. As previously discussed, the department
has the basic regulatory functions necessary and significant experience
in cybersecurity issues. The relationship with DOD has improved
significantly in cybersecurity and a cooperative strategy is in place.
[What Homeland Security [lacks]{.mark} in the cybersecurity leadership
role is [consistent]{.mark} [Presidential and congressional
focus]{.mark}.]{.underline} It has a coordination role given to it by
the President in a series of decision documents, but coordination is not
control. Homeland Security cannot truly compel other departments to
adhere to its policies and decisions. The department itself is still
growing and developing. Less than 10 years old, it does not have the
longstanding policies and cultures of the Department of State or DOD.
Congress has not helped the problems at the department and must clarify
its committee jurisdiction issues regarding not only cybersecurity but
also all of the missions assigned to Homeland Security. At present, more
than 80 committees have a role in the department's oversight.18 The
other significant hurdle for Homeland Security is building the human
capital necessary to establish and implement policy and operations in
support of cybersecurity. The department has announced ambitious plans
for growing its cyber forces, but it will not be easy. Recruiting and
retaining these specialists will be a constant challenge.
[Recommendations [Cybersecurity is a daunting policy problem,]{.mark}
and a simple solution is not apparent. The choice will be a compromise
among various options that must occur [within a political environment
with a limited attention span and several competing
priorities.]{.mark}]{.underline} The President and Congress should do
the following:

last week that [the White House]{.mark} has launched an "interagency

[[with an eye on taking back]{.mark} some of the broad [authorities
Cyber Command has]{.mark} held]{.underline} since the Trump
administration issued National Security Policy Memorandum-13 (NSPM-13)
in September 2018. [[Sen.]{.mark} Angus [King,]{.mark} I-Maine told
Naksone at the open session hearing that he [was]{.mark} very [concerned
about]{.mark} a potential [scaling back of NSPM-13]{.mark}, which he
called "[a grave mistake \[that\] would undermine deterrence at the
worst possible moment."]{.mark} Other [senators also expressed worry
about]{.mark} a possible [weakening of NSPM-13]{.mark}, with Sen. Mike
Rounds, R-S.D., pointedly asking Nakasone if losing the authority to use
"persistent engagement" to defeat adversaries in cyberspace [would harm
national security]{.mark}. Nakasone said that prior to Cyber Command
receiving NSPM-13 cyberspace authorities, his agency was forced to do
less to defend American interests in cyberspace.]{.underline}
Specifically, [Nakasone said he is unaware of any examples of so-called
cyber effects operations --- which DOD defines as operations "where the
primary purpose is to externally defend or conduct force projection in
or through cyberspace" --- prior to Cyber Command gaining
[NSPM-13](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/nspm-13/)
authorities]{.underline} in 2018. Nakasone also told Rounds that
[NSPM-13 authorities helped protect the 2018 and 2020 U.S. elections
from cyber interference by hostile foreign governments.]{.underline}
While careful to say he'll review the proposed changes from the White
House before making a final judgment, Nakasone allowed that,
"significant changes to that NSPM, it could affect what we need to do."
King's remarks opposing revisions to NSPM-13 followed a letter to
President Joseph Biden that he and Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., sent
Monday in their capacity as chairs of [the congressionally created panel
designed to recommend cybersecurity legislation and best practices that
was formerly known as the Cyberspace Solarium
Commission.](https://www.cyberscoop.com/cyberspace-solarium-commission-csc-2-0/)
The executive director of the commission, Mark Montgomery, [previously
relayed his objections to
CyberScoop.](https://www.cyberscoop.com/debate-u-s-cyber-command-lose-cyber-ops-authorities/)
"One of the most important improvements in our national cyber capability
over the past four years has been the development of effective, timely
planning processes for the execution of offensive cyber operations,"
[the letter
says.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21576892-220404solariumwhletter-1)
"As the co-chairmen of the National Cyberspace Solarium Commission we
are very concerned by press reporting that your administration may be
considering changes to the governing policy document, National Security
Policy Memorandum-13, with an intent to limit the Secretary of Defense's
freedom of action to plan and conduct offensive cyber operations." [In
their letter, King and Gallagher hailed NSPM-13 for allowing more
"agile" cyber operations. [They said the policy enabled the
D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f [D]{.mark}efense [to]{.mark} better
[thwart Russia]{.mark}n information operations in the 2018 and 2020
elections and asserted that it plays an important role in "signaling our
willingness to use cyber capabilities, a key aspect to an effective
national cyber strategy." "Any effort to weak and possibly alter NSPM-13
signals to our adversaries a lack of credible willingness to use
offensive cyber capabilities which undermines the credibility of our
deterrent]{.underline}," the letter concluded.

This does not mean that states that face hostile hybrid activities below
the threshold of armed conflict will be left alone. [Intelligence
cooperation between allied countries does exist, and threat information
is occasionally shared]{.underline}. In addition to the current
political collaboration facilitated by NATO to improve network security
and resilience, the EU is engaging in similar civilian activities, as
well as developing and implementing a cyber-diplomatic toolbox to create
a common basis for responding to a variety of malicious activities
against member states. Further strengthening the political partnership
between the EU and NATO is thus the most appropriate way forward to
avoid further militarization of cyberspace. **[[Sustaining]{.mark} the
[intell]{.mark}igence [norm]{.mark} as the dominant norm [is not without
potential problems]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Openly embracing the fact
that cyberspace is a domain in which intelligence agencies are
constrained only by domestic laws, and where takedowns of servers in
foreign countries are not necessarily perceived as serious breaches of
sovereignty, is likely to lead to an increase in the exploitation of IT
vulnerabilities in commercial software used in both enemy and allied
networks. For smaller states, this could increase the risk of
retaliation by larger adversaries, and it could increase the risk of
divisions between allies---divisions that are not aligned with the
United States' political ambition to use cyber coordination in NATO as
part of its attempt to 'defend forward'.74 More exploitation could also
ultimately make cyberspace less free, less open and less secure,
rendering civilian populations more susceptible to cybercrime,
surveillance and disruptions of everyday services.75 This is why **[some

promote norms that emphasize restraint on the part of states'

Attribution difficulties present further challenges to the 'who' of
deterrence. Adversaries with rapidly changing tactics, techniques, and
procedures---along with the ability to easily conceal an operation's
origin and perpetrator---can pose hurdles to technical attribution.41
Technical difficulties can weaken deterrent postures by delaying the
timeliness of retaliatory punishment. Moreover, the effects of an
operation that a defender notices may actually be second- or third-order
effects. This can add additional time between attribution and
punishment.42 **[The larger attribution issues]{.underline}**, however,
**[are political]{.underline}**. NATO lacks common standards or guidance
for attributing cyber operations in either a technical or political
sense. Indeed, **[attribution remains a member state
prerogative]{.underline}**. Not only are the targeted member states
responsible for attribution, but those members looking to contribute to
collective defense must perform independent attribution assessments, and
**[the political decision for a collective defense response must come
from the NAC]{.underline}**.43 **[[Reaching]{.mark} a [consensus]{.mark}
decision to trigger collective defense in response to cyberspace
operations [is likely to be politically contentious]{.mark}, and [member
states will have few incentives to risk revealing the intelligence
sources and methods that underlie attribution
decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These dynamics are likely to intensify
when additional links in the attribution chain are required, such as
when a perpetrator is encouraged or sponsored by an adversarial state
but lacks direct ties. Attribution is less likely to be politically
controversial across the Alliance once a conventional conflict is
underway as contextual clues from kinetic attacks can reduce
uncertainty. This discussion points to a greater role for
deterrence-by-denial. Deterring an adversary by taking measures to deny
potential gains does not hinge on attribution and thus possesses a
potentially wider scope of application.44 A second and related hurdle
for cyber deterrence is determining which actions the Alliance seeks to
deter. Much of the activity in cyberspace falls below the physical
effects thresholds associated with the disruption, degradation, or
destruction of computers and networks. Such considerations complicate
decisions to invoke Article 5---specifically, the types of cyberattacks
to which Article 5 should apply. Indeed, cyber operations targeting
military assets or critical civilian infrastructure can be incredibly
costly but may not reach damage levels associated with conventional
attacks.45 Moreover, espionage via network exploitation is widespread,
varied, and falls well below the threshold of armed conflict.46
Problematically, such exploitation can be nearly indistinguishable from
operations that eventually seek to attack computers or networks and
produce effects. Network exploitation can even be precursor to
conventional military operations.47 Determining how to deter presents a
third obstacle to NATO's cyber deterrence efforts. Threatening
conventional military means in response to cyber operations poses
dilemmas of proportionality and can risk unintended escalation.48
[[Retaliation]{.mark} with cyber [tools carry their own
problems]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, [the Alliance faces issues of
political reliability, particularly in the context of the SCEPVA
framework. Legally, [Allies retain different constitutional restraints
on o]{.mark}ffensive [c]{.mark}yber [o]{.mark}peration[s]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} can [hamper the ability to volunteer sovereign
effects]{.mark}]{.underline}. Strategically, **[[states may be hesitant
to volunteer their 'best' cyber effects for fear of burning an exploit
that could have had a greater payoff when used in a national
context]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Volunteering sovereign effects can also
inadvertently give unwanted insight to an adversary regarding an Ally's
techniques, tactics, and procedures. Second, the temporary and transient
nature of cyber capabilities makes it incredibly difficult to establish
repeatable and predictable effects required of deterrent
threats.]{.underline}49 Finally, signaling in cyberspace is generally
ambiguous and rarely straightforward.50 For instance, an adversary may
not even recognize a signal, believing it instead to be a technical
glitch. Even if a costly signal is received, there is no way to ensure
that it has interpreted as intended. In addition to deterrence, NATO's
fail-safe cyber defense efforts face political and technical challenges.
Because NATO will not undertake any active defense measures, actions to
mitigate the effects of a cyberattack are limited to NATO networks or to
individual member state networks when requested. This forecloses the
possibility of developing an institutional strategy to mitigate the
costs of a cyberattack upstream by disrupting the source of an attack,
much like US Cyber Command does with its "defend forward" posture.51
More problematically, [[Allies have and will continue to have different
legal, strategic, doctrinal, and threat frameworks for
cyberspace]{.mark} that complicate defensive measures for the
Alliance.]{.underline} Most immediately this means that Allies will
locate resources to different aspects of cyber defense based on
individual country circumstances. [Different strategic focuses have the
potential to intensify disparate threat perceptions, capabilities, and
skillsets]{.underline}. This can also exacerbate interoperability
problems; for example, during an operation or crisis, some systems will
be controlled by NATO while others will be controlled by an ally or a
group of allies with different skill and knowledge levels. In the longer
term, disparate legal understandings, particularly regarding sovereignty
in cyberspace, will become more impactful as a greater number of allied
nations develop forward defense strategies and the requisite
capabilities for out-of-network operations. [[An out-of-network
operation can in and of itself cause operational
friction]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, [[differing definitions of
sovereignty in cyberspace]{.mark}---and what violates it---**[inevitably
create political friction]{.mark}** between Allies as some look to
operate and produce effects on other Allies' networks]{.underline}.52
**[[This political friction will contribute to even greater hesitancy
over cyber-intelligence sharing and complicate the
coordination]{.underline}]{.mark}** of defensive mitigation measures
across the Alliance.

That's not what happened. In fact[, **[cyber weapons exist in a

**[shrouded in secrecy]{.mark}**, with]{.underline} plenty of curiosity
but [very little public information.]{.underline} In part this
**[[secrecy is integral to the whole concept]{.underline}]{.mark}**: a
cyberattack is useful insofar as the enemy is unaware of it. [The more

Cyber Attribution Debates Tear Apart the NATO Alliance,"
https://www.lawfareblog.com/dont-let-cyber-attribution-debates-tear-apart-nato-alliance\]

The United States still struggles to find effective policies for
deterring cyberattacks. Suggestions run the gamut from more widespread
use of indictments and economic sanctions, despite their lackluster
record of success, to less traditional but more risky policies that
emphasize the asymmetric advantage America has in conventional military
power. Most of the discussion of cyber deterrence focuses on preventing
a single catastrophic or cascading cyberattack that would threaten lives
(like disruptions to electricity transmission or clean water)---or our
way of life---altering election outcomes or grinding global finance to a
halt. Yet the reality is that in the event of such an attack, the
response would likely not come from the U.S. alone but from the NATO
alliance in concert. [**[NATO's cyber-defense mandate has
evolved]{.mark}** over time **to update its collective defense
commitment**]{.underline} under Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty
[for the era of cyberattacks.]{.underline} In the latest effort to
collectively impose costs on adversaries, [the 2018 NATO Summit saw a
commitment from heads of state and government "[to integrate]{.mark}
sovereign [cyber effects, provided voluntarily by Allies]{.mark}, into
Alliance operations and missions, [in the framework of strong political
oversight]{.mark}]{.underline}." The newly updated White House National
Cyber Strategy likewise envisions working together with a "coalition of
like-minded states" to "ensure adversaries understand the consequences
of their malicious cyber behavior." [[Therein lies the rub.]{.mark} Both
formal [alliances, such as NATO]{.mark}, and more ad hoc arrangements,
such as what the Cyber Deterrence Initiative imagines, [will require
members to share intelligence]{.mark} and eventually, to the best of
their ability and perhaps in different domains, contribute to joint
action against a presumably well-armed foreign aggressor]{.underline}.
[States]{.underline} including the United States, the United Kingdom,
the Netherlands, Estonia, and Denmark [have publicly declared their
willingness to lend sovereign offensive cyber effects to deter, defend
against and counter the full spectrum of threats.]{.underline} [Sharing
intelligence and information is a key element of NATO's core
decision-making process enshrined in Article 4]{.underline} of the
Washington Treaty. **[[Political consultations are part of the
preventive diplomacy between member states]{.mark}, but they are also an
avenue to discuss concerns related to the security threats member states
face.]{.underline}** These consultations can be a catalyst for reaching
a consensus on policies to be adopted or actions to be taken---including
those on the use of sovereign cyber effects to support a NATO operation.
The alliance has a track record of collective action and cooperative
security measures. For example, Operation Active Endeavour helped to
deter, disrupt and protect against terrorist activity in the
Mediterranean in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, in
solidarity with the United States. For the seventh time, the Atlantic
Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative will be among the organizations
privileged to organize an event on the sidelines of the Feb. 15--17
Munich Security Conference. This year in particular, the Atlantic
Council's event, "Defending Human Dignity: Limiting Malicious Cyber
Activity Through Diplomacy," will complement the topics high on the
agenda of the main conference, such as transatlantic collaboration, the
consequences of a resurgence of great power competition and the future
of arms control. In the United States, the greatest failures of response
and deterrence to foreign aggression in cyberspace have not been caused
by a lack of intelligence, capability or imagination. Rather, [[U.S.
policy has been]{.underline}]{.mark} serviceable in theory but
[[impotent in practice because of]{.mark} an [inability to
translate]{.mark} technical findings and [intelligence into public
support for]{.mark} sufficiently tough responses ordered by elected
[political leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}. [North Korea's repeated
operations targeting U.S. companies and critical infrastructure have
been met with [public skepticism]{.mark} [over]{.mark} their
[culpability, limit]{.mark}ing [the strength of]{.mark} retaliatory
[options needed to deter]{.mark} further events. Chinese cyber economic
espionage continued for years despite widespread knowledge of China's
activities because [political leaders found it difficult to confront
Beijing without undermining U.S. companies]{.mark} in return. Russian
information operations did not sow enough doubt to mislead experts, but
they succeeded in [exacerbating the partisan polarization of an
already-divided electorate and its leaders. That inability to translate
the findings of cyber experts into public]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[sentiment and therefore political action has sidelined America's
cyberwarriors]{.underline}]{.mark}, by far the most technologically
advanced and well-resourced in the world. Imagine the political response
of an ally that is asked to burden-share in response to cyber aggression
but is probably much closer to any resulting kinetic fight than the
United States. Now imagine the response of that ally when it's being
asked to take causus belli on faith: The United States is presenting
attribution for a cyberattack elsewhere in the world, but perhaps is
depending on the ally lacking critical details due to classification,
and is presenting that information alongside a request for help that
might well put the ally in the crosshairs of its own cyberattack or
lethal action. How can allies with different capabilities to collect,
analyze and understand intelligence be part of a consensus on using
sovereign cyber effects to support a NATO operation? How can a commander
achieve a common operational picture to authorize the use of sovereign
effects in a NATO operation if all the allies are not on the same page
with respect to critical attribution and other technical information
needed for a use of effect in an operation? We all know what a tank
looks like on a shared satellite image, but if you ask three cyber
experts to interpret the attribution for a set of indicators, you are
likely to get at least four answers. For most U.S. allies in Europe and
elsewhere, there is simply a dearth of technical know-how within the
government when it comes to cyber attribution and operations. This is
already a challenge for the United States, with a massive defense
budget, Silicon Valley innovation and an educated workforce to pull into
government service. But for many U.S. allies, tech-savvy public servants
will have long fled for the private sector, nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) and academia before reaching ministerial positions.
To its credit, the U.S. National Cyber Strategy does propose
capacity-building measures to support allies. This means building up law
enforcement, intelligence, and military operational and investigative
capability. But even with successful capacity-building programs, many
nations could, in a crisis, end up in the same place the United States
is---with good options stuck on the shelf while political leaders and
their electorates lack a critical mass of informed voters to trust,
understand and act on expert findings. For countries weighing whether to
risk their own blood and treasure in support of an ally's cyber
attribution findings, this hurdle could well prove insurmountable if not
addressed well before a crisis emerges. Many such countries will no
doubt recall being burned when placing too much confidence in U.S.
technical and human sources without an ability to evaluate the evidence
for themselves, as with the Iraq weapons of mass destruction findings.
The private sector will probably play a crucial role in providing
intelligence to support alliance responses to cyberattacks, especially
as a stopgap over the next few years. FireEye and its peer competitors
and partners regularly produce analyses of major world cyber
events---many that fly below the radar of Western leadership, in
fact---sometimes at a near-government quality and often covering much of
the same "classified" evidence. More important, private-sector analysts
are accustomed to writing for impact with both their technical
counterparts, like chief information security officers (CISOs) and
threat hunters, and nontechnical stakeholders such as boards of
directors, CEOs and other persons controlling the purse strings. In this
sense, unclassified, private-sector and NGO-driven cyber threat
intelligence can become the lingua franca of discussions. Relying on
commercial reporting generated by international teams, rather than
declassified government-generated reports, both broadens the audience
enough to make alliance discussions feasible and mitigates against
disparities in terminology across national lines---the tendency of even
closely integrated allies to describe cyber "attack," "information
operations," and attribution findings with different implicit
assumptions or implications. Long-Term Thinking In the long run, though,
**[[the U.S.]{.mark} and its more technologically advanced
allies]{.underline}**---such as its fellow Five Eyes (Australia, Canada,
New Zealand and the U.K.), France and Japan---**[[will have to make
important policy changes in the interests of furthering alliance
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in cyberspace: [a willingness
to]{.mark} sometimes [risk sensitive sources]{.mark} and methods in
order to get cyber threat intelligence into the hands of other countries
better positioned to take policy action, [an end to classifying
public]{.mark} [info]{.mark}rmation like IP addresses solely because of
their acquisition via classified means, and greater transparency on
their own decision-making.]{.underline} Government cyber leaders within
the alliance should consider taking another page out of the
private-sector playbook as well: running cyber-crisis exercises that
involve more than the IT department. In the commercial world, the more
successful practice runs involve leaders at both the CISO level and some
presence from nontechnical teams that would weigh in during a crisis,
such as communications and legal. The best exercises involve executives,
too, who despite their busy schedules must see for themselves how their
companies would survive and respond during a potentially ruinous
cyberattack, and work through the minutiae of leading a response
themselves. The experience and confidence is invaluable if ever called
on during a real-life crisis, and the organizational introspection by
involving decision-makers at all levels is irreplaceable.
Military-to-military cyber training as part of cross-country force
standardization and joint operational planning could pull in more senior
national leadership, beyond battlefield commanders, and be coupled with
increased funding for foreign affairs-led training for nontechnical
leaders. The private sector could also meaningfully contribute during
NATO consultations when developing Allied Joint Publications to make
sure that definitions and requirements for threat intelligence
incorporate the best practices of NATO member countries' private
sectors. If a U.S. diplomat reaches out to his or her counterpart in an
allied country to ask for assistance responding to malware that's
damaging critical infrastructure, and that counterpart has to ask what
malware is, the response isn't going to happen. \*\*\* NATO's essential
and enduring purpose is to safeguard the freedom and security of all its
members by political and military means. Tolerating cyberattacks,
especially those deliberately targeting civilians and the political
legitimacy of governments---without the alliance having the capability
to jointly discuss attribution and have the confidence to act and assist
one another---undermines this core purpose of the alliance. Likewise,
pursuing only deterrence and response without an active role for the
alliance in reaching peaceful diplomatic agreements with potential
adversaries abrogates member responsibilities to their citizens but is
impossible without a common language and operational picture to discuss
enforcement of such agreements. The U.S. is stronger with allies, and
with attention to these issues its cybersecurity can be too.

### L ---Turf War (NSA)

#### Offensive cyber action sparks turf wars -- the plan guarantees backlash from non-DoD agencies and committees

'turf war' complicates cybersecurity efforts," The Hill, 4-29-18,
<https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/385272-federal-turf-war-complicates-cybersecurity-efforts/>)
//sg

Lawmakers are concerned that [bureaucratic turf wars are complicating
the federal response to cyber threats.]{.underline} The issue took
center stage this week, as senators on the Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs Committee fretted that they had been unable to pass
key cyber legislation requested by the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) because of a disagreement with the Senate Intelligence Committee.
{mosads}"The reality of the situation is there is conflict here," said
Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) at a hearing Wednesday. "This threat is
too significant to allow turf wars to get in the way of as efficient an
operation as possible in terms of dealing with a very complex and
serious problem." The dust-up illuminates the broader issue of turf wars
over cybersecurity in the federal government. [The executive branch has
**no one single agency assigned to handle cyber**. Instead, authorities
are spread out over various agencies]{.underline}, including the Justice
Department, which investigates and prosecutes cyber crime, and the
[Pentagon and broader intelligence community]{.underline}, both of which
[handle]{.underline} what is considered ["offensive" cyber
activity]{.underline}. While Homeland Security is broadly recognized as
the main agency defending federal networks and critical national assets
from cyberattacks, individual agencies also play a major role in
guarding their own networks and personnel from malicious cyber actors.
[The set-up means that **virtually every congressional committee** has a
say in the federal government's cybersecurity efforts.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- L -- NATO 

#### Republicans don't support NATO -- Finland and Sweden prove

**Schnell 7/18** -- staff writer for The Hill. (Mychael, "House approves
resolution supporting Finland, Sweden joining NATO; 18 Republicans vote

STC

The House approved a [resolution]{.underline} on Monday [that expressed
support for Finland and Sweden joining NATO]{.underline}, exactly two
months after the Nordic countries submitted applications to become part
of the military alliance amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The resolution [cleared the House in a 394-18 vote]{.underline}, [with
only Republicans voting in opposition]{.underline}. Two Democrats and
[17 Republicans did not vote]{.underline}.

[The GOP lawmakers who voted "no" were]{.underline} Reps. Andy
[Biggs]{.underline} (Ariz.), Dan [Bishop]{.underline} (N.C.), Lauren
[Boebert]{.underline} (Colo.), Madison [Cawthorn]{.underline} (N.C.),
Ben [Cline]{.underline} (Va.), Michael [Cloud]{.underline} (Texas),

(Ill.), Ralph [Norman]{.underline} (S.C.), Matt [Rosendale]{.underline}
(Mont.), Chip [Roy]{.underline} (Texas) and Jefferson Van
[Drew]{.underline} (N.J.).

The measure, which has bipartisan sponsorship, expresses support for
Finland and Sweden's "historic decision" to apply to NATO and calls on
member states to formally support them joining the military alliance.

It also opposes any efforts by the Russian Federation to adversely
respond to Finland and Sweden's decision to join the alliance and urges
NATO members to satisfy the two percent defense spending pledge that
countries signed on to at the 2014 Wales Summit. That declaration said
that NATO allies currently spending at least 2 percent of their gross
domestic product on defense would try to continue to do so.

#### 63 Republicans despise NATO -- reverting to past support is wishful thinking

House Republicans vote against resolution affirming support for NATO,"

STC

Nearly **[one-third of the House Republican Caucus]{.underline}** on
Tuesday night [**voted against a resolution that vowed support for**
both democratic values and the **N**]{.underline}orth
**[A]{.underline}**tlantic **[T]{.underline}**reaty
**[O]{.underline}**rganization --- the alliance of countries that seeks
to keep peace and prevent threats from illiberal countries.

The resolution passed by a vote of 362 - 63, with [all 63 \"no\" votes
coming from Republican members]{.underline} --- many of whom are allies
of former President Donald Trump.

The resolution states that the House is voicing its \"unequivocal
support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,\" and tells
President Biden to declare his \"support for shared democratic values\"
and his commitment \"to enhancing NATO\'s capacity to strengthen
democratic institutions within NATO member, partner, and aspirant
countries.\"

The 63 Republicans who voted against reaffirming support for NATO
included Reps. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Madison Cawthorn (R-NC), Matt
Gaetz (R-FL), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Jim
Jordan (R-OH), Thomas Massie (R-KY), and Chip Roy (R-TX).

\"[**NATO is a relic** of the Cold War. Why should Americans pay for
Europe\'s defense?]{.underline}\" Massie tweeted in defense of his
\"no\" vote Tuesday.

The vote came amid Russia\'s ongoing brutal invasion of Ukraine. The
Russian government, led by President Vladimir Putin, has been working to
weaken the NATO alliance in order to expand the country\'s power and
influence in Eastern Europe.

House [Democrats]{.underline} quickly [condemned the 63 Republican
lawmakers who voted against the resolution]{.underline}, which was
sponsored by Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA).

\"My resolution is simple --- it reaffirms that democratic principles
are at the heart of NATO and calls for a new NATO center dedicated to
the protection of democracy worldwide,\" Connolly tweeted on Tuesday
evening. \"[63 of Putin\'s Puppets voted against it]{.underline}.\"

\"Just now 63 House Republicans --- nearly one-third of the entire GOP
caucus --- voted against support for NATO \'as an alliance founded on
democratic principles,\'\" Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) tweeted on Tuesday
evening. \"The GOP truly is Putin\'s Party.\"

Even some House Republicans expressed confusion about why their
colleagues voted against the resolution. Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL)
chastised his fellow Republicans for \"showing Putin sympathy.\"

\"I don\'t even have a clue why \... I mean every no vote should be
asked repeatedly by their local papers why,\" Kinzinger tweeted on
Tuesday night.

\"[I hope my party can finally remember]{.underline} where [our
foundations]{.underline} are and actually say that we\'re not going to
be Putin-sympathetic anymore,\" he added in a video posted to Twitter,
adding that his hope was [likely \"**wishful thinking**]{.underline}.\"

#### **Specifically, GOP opposition helped Putin**

**Saletan '22** -- writer at The Bulwark. (William, "Putin Wants to

Vladimir [Putin's central objective]{.underline} in Europe isn't to
capture Kyiv, the Donbas, or any other part of Ukraine. It's [to weaken
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization]{.underline}, which protects most
of the continent against him. And in that longstanding campaign, Putin
scored two significant victories this week.

One was in France, where Marine Le Pen, a Putin sympathizer, finished a
close second to Emmanuel Macron in Sunday's French presidential
election. Le Pen is running almost even with Macron in polls for the
April 24 runoff. She has said that if she wins, she'll withdraw France
from NATO's command structure.

The other [victory was in the United States, where **63 House
Republicans**, nearly a third of the GOP conference, **voted against a
resolution of support for NATO.**]{.underline}

The House vote, taken on April 5, is a warning sign. [Putin may be
losing ground in Ukraine, but he's gaining ground in the U.S.
Congress.]{.underline} [Three years ago, 22 House Republicans voted
against pro-NATO legislation. That number has nearly
tripled.]{.underline}

[The "Putin wing" of the House GOP]{.underline}---useful idiots such as
Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene, who openly spout Russian
propaganda---[is only a tiny fraction of the Kremlin's target audience
in Congress. They're joined by a larger crowd of Ukraine bashers,
hardcore isolationists, and right-wingers who say we shouldn't worry
about anyone else's borders until we "secure" our own.]{.underline}
Together, that coalition adds up to [more than 20
lawmakers]{.underline}.

That's a problem. But [when you combine them with the NATO skeptics who
voted against last week's resolution---**another 40** or so **House
Republicans who don't trust alliances** and who view Europeans as
America's rivals or adversaries---the problem gets a lot
bigger.]{.underline}

[The GOP's turn against NATO is particularly worrisome]{.underline}
because Congress has been warned, explicitly and repeatedly, about
Putin's goal of dissolving the alliance. In March 2017, after a U.S.
intelligence report confirmed that Russia had interfered in the 2016
U.S. presidential election, the House Committee on Foreign
Affairs---which was then, like the rest of Congress, under Republican
control---held a hearing on this subject. The hearing was titled,
"Undermining Democratic Institutions and Splintering NATO: Russian
Disinformation Aims." Analysts and former officials explained to the
committee how Russia had, in the words of one witness, persistently
funded propaganda in the West to "fracture allied security, stoke public
distrust against democratic institutions, and discredit the alliance
structures that defend Europe."

Over the next two years, other reports documented the same problem. The
European Council on Foreign Relations noted Russia's efforts to
undermine support for NATO in Finland, the Czech Republic, and other
countries. Foreign policy journals and articles in the American press
noted rising alarm in Europe at President Donald [Trump's threats to
withdraw U.S. troops from the continent or to abandon the American
commitment to defend NATO allies.]{.underline}

On January 14, 2019, the New York Times reported that "several times" in
2018, [Trump had "privately said he wanted to withdraw" from the
alliance.]{.underline} The article said Trump had "told his top national
security officials that he did not see the point of the military
alliance, which he presented as a drain on the United States."

A few days after the Times report, House [Democrats]{.underline} filed
and [brought]{.underline} to the floor [the NATO Support Act, which
reaffirmed that the U.S. was "solemnly committed]{.underline} to the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's principle of collective defense as
enumerated in Article 5." The bill couldn't completely bind Trump, but
it expressed the sense of Congress that "the President shall not
withdraw the United States from NATO" and that American policy was "to
reject any efforts to withdraw the United States from NATO." It also
prohibited the use of federal funds "to take any action to withdraw the
United States" from the alliance.

Every Democrat voted for the bill; [22 Republicans voted against
it.]{.underline}

One of the 22 Republicans, Rep. Scott Perry, explained why he and other
self-styled hawks had voted no. In a statement to constituents, he
complained that "the bill prevented the U.S. from ever leaving NATO . .
. unless Congress first voted to repeal this would-be new law." Perry
wanted Trump to be free to pull America out of NATO, on his own.

Perry also argued that Trump should be free "to negotiate better terms
for the United States in NATO," as though the alliance were a trade
deal. And he warned that "an ally of ours today may not be an ally
tomorrow."

That's how [Perry and]{.underline} many of [his colleagues]{.underline}
viewed the world. They [saw alliances as entanglements and
burdens.]{.underline} They worried that even friendly countries couldn't
be trusted. They believed that America should hedge its commitments
because our allies might screw us.

[And that was all Putin needed]{.underline}. He didn't need American
lawmakers to love him the way Trump did. [He just needed them to
constrain or withhold support from NATO.]{.underline}

#### And, Republican distrust extends into polarization of other issues, like the plan

STC

Earlier this week, [an astonishing 63 House Republicans opposed a
resolution supporting NATO]{.underline}. That's still not a full third
of the Republican conference, but [it's not exactly a tiny
fringe]{.underline}, either. To be fair, some of those objecting claimed
to oppose the non-binding, symbolic resolution because of some of its
specific wording rather than because they opposed the alliance --- but
quit[e a few seem to be wary of the whole concept of an alliance of
democracies against authoritarianism]{.underline}.

These lawmakers are only reflecting where their party appears to be
heading. In two recent polls, [strong minorities of Republicans --- 40%
of respondents]{.underline} in one survey --- [supported leaving the
alliance altogether.]{.underline}

If a Republican committed to the old consensus wins the 2024 nomination
and is elected president, I'd expect all of that to dissipate pretty
rapidly. Both parties will once again be strong supporters of NATO in
particular and of the general overarching direction of U.S. foreign
policy since the 1940s. But if Trump is nominated, and especially if he
wins the presidency, it's hard to see the party working as hard to
constrain his foreign-policy choices as it once did. And if Democrats
remain in the White House for another four years (or more)? [It's easy
to imagine partisan polarization extending into this area,]{.underline}
as it has so many others, [with Republicans automatically opposing
whatever it is that Democratic presidents are doing]{.underline} ---
[including participation in the alliance]{.underline}s that Eisenhower,
Nixon, Gerald Ford, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush all
strongly supported.

[Preventing that result would require strong]{.underline}, responsible
[leadership from Republican politicians. I'm not optimistic that will
happen.]{.underline}

The Washington Post, 4-29-2022,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/29/nato-republicans-trump/)//>
STC

In early 2019, several months after President Donald Trump threatened to
upend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization during a trip to Brussels
for the alliance's annual summit, House lawmakers passed the [NATO
Support Act]{.underline} amid overwhelming bipartisan support, with only
[22 Republicans voting against the measure.]{.underline}

[But this month, when a similar bill in support of NATO]{.underline}
during the Russian invasion of Ukraine again faced a vote in the House,
[the support was far more polarized, with 63 Republicans --- **30
percent of the party's conference**]{.underline} --- **[voting against
it.]{.underline}**

[The vote underscores the Republican Party's remarkable drift away from
NATO in recent years]{.underline}, as positions once considered part of
a libertarian fringe have become doctrine for a growing portion of the
party.

The [**isolationist posture** of some Republicans is in line with the
"America First" ethos of Trump, the GOP's de facto leader, who has long
railed against NATO.]{.underline} Last week, speaking at a Heritage
Foundation event in Florida, Trump implied that as president he had
threatened not to defend NATO allies from Russian attacks as a
negotiating tactic to pressure them to contribute more money toward the
organization's shared defense.

The vote also comes against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of
Ukraine, which has catapulted NATO to its most prominent role in
decades. And it comes as some hawkish [Republicans seek to cast
themselves as stronger opponents of Russia than Democrats.]{.underline}

Metin Hakverdi, a German lawmaker who chairs the North America working
group within the ruling Social Democratic Party, said the question that
preoccupies him is, "Was Donald Trump the exception, or will Joe Biden
be the exception?"

[Some two dozen House GOP lawmakers who voted for the 2019 NATO Support
Act voted against the similar resolution this month]{.underline}, which
reaffirmed support for the alliance and its principles. But in
interviews, several of those House Republicans said they still support
the organization and simply objected to what they viewed as problematic
provisions that Democrats had added to the bill for perceived political
purposes.

[Several who switched their votes]{.underline} since 2019 [objected to
measures]{.underline} they said did [not specifically]{.underline}
address [strengthening NATO to help Ukraine]{.underline}. Rep. Barry
Loudermilk (R-Ga.) found it particularly problematic that the resolution
instructed NATO to be involved when a country has "internal threats from
proponents on illiberalism," which he says could be interpreted as
conservatism.

"I am a huge supporter of NATO --- I served in the Air Force during the
Cold War, worked with NATO during that time period," he said. "These
issues should be left to those individual nations."

Loudermilk argued that Democrats had inserted "poison pills" into the
symbolic resolution, which could be used against Republicans in the 2022
midterms. "It was the Democrats trying to politicize something and add
things in there that we have no business working on," he said,
explaining his vote against the bill.

Similarly, from Rep. Robert B. Aderholt (R-Ala.): "I am wholeheartedly,
unequivocally, without reservation, supportive on NATO."

But Aderholt said he worried that the resolution "had some language in
that I thought went on the political side. And I don't want to see NATO
go political. I want to see NATO stand up for, you know, what's going on
in Ukraine --- stand up for Ukraine against Russia."

The two bills are not exactly the same. The legislation in 2019
reaffirmed that federal money should not be used to remove the United
States from NATO --- which Trump was threatening at the time --- while
the bill from this month called on the government to "uphold the
founding democratic principles of NATO," as well for NATO "to continue
to provide unwavering support to the people of Ukraine as they fight for
their sovereignty, territorial integrity, and a democratic future."

Another sign of the party's isolationist wing emerged Thursday, as the
House passed an update to a World War II-era military bill creating a
lend-lease program intended to make it easier for the United States to
supply Ukraine with military aid. Only 10 lawmakers --- all Republicans
--- voted against the measure.

In an exchange earlier in the week between Secretary of State Antony
Blinken, who was testifying before Congress, and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.),
Paul pushed back on Blinken's assertion that over the years Russia has
shown a willingness to attack countries like Georgia that are not part
of NATO, while giving wider berth to countries that are members of the
alliance.

"You could also argue the countries they've attacked were part of
Russia, or were part of the Soviet Union," said Paul, who was one of
just two senators who voted against a 2018 bill reaffirming support for
a NATO, in what was at the time a pointed rebuke of Trump.

"Yes, and I firmly disagree with that proposition," Blinken responded.

For some foreign policy experts and international allies, [the mere fact
that nearly one-third of the Republican conference voted against a bill
that fundamentally seeks to support both NATO and Ukraine highlights a
marked foreign policy evolution in the Republican Party.]{.underline}

"[We now are really seeing the true impact of deep, deep political
polarization]{.underline}, where it is better to harm the other side
than do what's right for the country," said Heather Conley, president of
the German Marshall Fund. "This deep [**domestic polarization has now
crept into foreign and security policy.**]{.underline} There has always
been strong bipartisan support for NATO, but [everything]{.underline}
now [has become polarized and can be weaponized against the other side,
even if it supports U.S. national security interests."]{.underline}

#### Times have changed -- GOP "no's" mark heavy anti-NATO sentiment

**Blake '22** -- senior political reporter. (Aaron, "Why 30 percent of
the House GOP voted against reaffirming NATO support," The Washington
Post, 4-6-2022,

**[Times have certainly changed]{.underline}**.

On Tuesday, [63 House Republicans voted against a symbolic resolution
reaffirming support for NATO and its principles]{.underline}, amid
Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [The "no" votes comprised more than 30
percent of the party's conference.]{.underline}

As with any such symbolic resolution, it's worth parsing exactly what it
contains. Oftentimes, these resolutions are crafted to force the other
party into a politically difficult vote by including smaller provisions
or loaded language they might object to, then accusing them of opposing
the overall (and often popular) thrust of the bill.

But [even accounting for]{.underline} those [details]{.underline},
**[this vote marks the latest shift away from what was once a
bipartisan, consensus view in Congress]{.underline}** --- [supporting
NATO and its importance in keeping Russia in check. And the shift
continues apace.]{.underline}

Few Republicans have commented on their reasons for opposing the
resolution, but writer Will Saletan previewed the vote Tuesday by noting
a number of ways in which [the party has drifted in a more
Russia-ambivalent and even **NATO-skeptical** direction.]{.underline}
Among the [emerging views]{.underline} he isolated: [that NATO was at
fault for provoking]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin]{.underline}, that we
should focus instead on our own Southern border, [and]{.underline} that
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has no business defending
European allies, whether in NATO or otherwise.]{.underline}

Among the few Republicans to comment on their vote was o[ne of the
party's most **anti-NATO** voices,]{.underline} Rep. Thomas
[Massie]{.underline} (R-Ky.). He [called NATO "a relic of the Cold
War"]{.underline} and asked, "Why should Americans pay for Europe's
defense?"

#### No public support for US-NATO action.

**Politico '19** (Mark Hannah, Politico Magazine, "Opinion \| It's Not
Just Trump. The American People Are Skeptical of NATO, Too," 12/05/19,

)

[But as the heads of NATO member countries gather this week in London,
some of that popular support is in jeopardy]{.underline}. This is one of
the conclusions of a
national [survey](https://egfound.org/stories/independent-america/indispensable-no-more) that
my colleagues and I at the Eurasia Group Foundation recently conducted.
For a second year in a row, when faced with a hypothetical scenario in
which Russia invaded Estonia, a NATO ally, [Americans were roughly split
on whether they wanted the United States to respond militarily. And that
was after respondents were reminded of Article 5]{.underline}, the part
of the NATO treaty that obligates the United States to respond to such
aggression, and after they were told that U.S. action could be the only
way to expel Russia. [It's not just President Donald Trump who is
skeptical of the North Atlantic alliance, in other words. It's the
American people]{.underline}. [To the extent that U.S. citizens think
about NATO at all, they disagree about whether honoring its commitments
would be worth the sacrifice]{.underline}. This wavering commitment
likely signals a belief that American protection is no longer necessary
for European security or that the [United States has different
priorities from when NATO was created 70 years ago.]{.underline} If NATO
wants to earn the confidence of American citizens---who, after all,
elect the American president whom NATO allies deal with---the alliance
must rethink its mission for the 21st century. To be sure, most
Americans still have a general sense that NATO is important to our
country's security, according to another
recent [survey](https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/sites/default/files/report_ccs19_rejecting-retreat_20190909.pdf) by
the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. But even that [survey found the
same divide on whether Americans would opt to retaliate against a
Russian attack on a NATO ally]{.underline}. As recently as the late
1990s, nearly [70 percent](https://fas.org/man/eprint/nato_pipa.htm) of
surveyed Americans supported sending U.S. troops to defend a new NATO
member from a military attack.

#### DoD military expansion is shunned by Congress -- narratives, funds, and fears of neo-Nazis

extremism **in the military** in a report on its]{.underline} version of
the fiscal [2023]{.underline} National Defense Authorization Act
([NDAA]{.underline}).

[The committee]{.underline} released the text of the bill this week,
after [voting 23-3 to advance the measure last month.]{.underline}

In the accompanying report, the committee says "the vast majority of
servicemembers serve with honor and distinction, and that [the narrative
surrounding systemic extremism in the military besmirches the men and
women in uniform."]{.underline}

"[The committee believes that spending additional]{.underline} time and
[resources to combat]{.underline} exceptionally [rare instances of
extremism in the military is an inappropriate use of taxpayer funds and
should be discontinued by the D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f
[D]{.underline}efense [immediately]{.underline}," the report continues.

The language in the bill's report was approved by a vote of 14-12, with
Sen. Angus [King]{.underline} (I-Maine), who typically caucuses with
Democrats, [joining all Republicans voting in favor of the
language.]{.underline}

**[Republicans have been open about their opposition to the Pentagon's
efforts]{.underline}**, essentially [saying it creates problems where
there aren't any]{.underline}.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered a force-wide "stand down" to
address extremism in February of 2021, amid the revelation that some
defendants charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the
U.S. Capitol had some connection to the military.

The committee's language cited a report from the Pentagon's Countering
Extremist Activity Working Group released in December, which says that
available data showed cases of prohibited extremist activity among
service members was rare. However, that [report]{.underline} also said
that [even a small number of cases could pose problems for the military
at large]{.underline}.

The language in the committee report is not legally binding. Even then,
it remains to be seen whether such language will be included in the
final version of the defense bill that will have to be negotiated
between the House and the Senate in conference committee.

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) offered a similar amendment to the House
version of the NDAA, which would express the sense that rooting out
extremism was not a "top priority" of the Pentagon. The House Armed
Services Committee turned down that amendment on a party-line vote.

[The Democratic-led House did include an amendment to compel government
officials to prepare a report on white supremacy and neo-Nazi activity
in the military and law enforcement.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Thumper -- Abortion

#### Abortion thumps -- heated congressional battles over legislation and name-calling

**Choi 7/17** -- staff writer for The Hill. (Joseph, "Abortion fight
comes to Senate, House floors," The Hill, 7-17-2022,
https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/3562671-abortion-fight-comes-to-senate-house-floors/)//
STC

**[Legislative battles over abortion]{.underline}** access [**are
heating up** in the House and Senate as Democrats look to raise pressure
on Republicans.]{.underline}

A round of [bills aimed at protecting abortion access]{.underline} that
were [introduced by Democrats were considered on Capitol Hill last
week]{.underline}, [leading to the first instances of lawmakers butting
heads over such legislation since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.
Wade]{.underline} last month.

[Though the bills are unlikely to pass]{.underline} in the evenly
divided Senate, [where they would require bipartisan support to overcome
the legislative filibuster, **Democrats** are pushing for action in the
aftermath of the court's decision and seeking to]{.underline} get
Republican members of Congress on the record objecting to legislation on
the issue in an apparent attempt to [**paint GOP lawmakers as** going to
**extreme**s to stop abortions.]{.underline}

**[Republicans]{.underline}** have [in turn **accused Democrats of
fearmongering** when they argue]{.underline} that [the GOP
will]{.underline} seek to block access to contraception and [try to
enact a nationwide abortion ban]{.underline}.

A bill that would codify protections for abortion access into federal
law --- the Women's Health Protection Act --- was passed by the House
219-209 almost entirely along party lines on Friday after previously
being approved by the chamber in September. Democratic Rep. Henry
Cuellar (Texas) voted against the measure, along with all Republican
members apart from two who did not vote.

[Republican lawmakers lambasted the legislation as a form of government
overreach during debate]{.underline} over it on Friday, with several
members referring to it as the "abortion on demand until birth act."
Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris [Rodgers]{.underline} (Wash.) [argued it
stripped away state laws that protected women from coercion]{.underline}
to terminate their pregnancies and claimed it would force physicians to
perform abortions.

The House also on Friday passed a bill 223-205 that would protect
out-of-state travel for abortion services, with three Republicans ---
Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) and Fred Upton
(Mich.) --- joining Democrats in voting for the measure.

**[Democratic lawmakers slammed their GOP colleagues for opposing the
bill.]{.underline}**

"It is absolutely important to get Republicans on the record to how far
they will go to restrict a woman's right," Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) told
The Hill. "Are they really saying that women should not be allowed to
travel to another state to get a medical procedure?"

Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) communications director Henry Connelly
tweeted shortly after the vote, "[Genuinely very scary that 205 House
Republicans]{.underline} just vot[ed to enable states to arrest, fine or
sue women for traveling to get an abortion]{.underline} \*even where it
is still legal.\*"

[GOP opposition means both bills are unlikely to pass in the evenly
divided Senate]{.underline}, where they will need 60 votes to overcome
the filibuster. The upper chamber has already failed to pass the Women's
Health Protection Act twice since September, and this week a Republican
senator blocked a separate bill seeking to protect those traveling
across state lines to get abortions.

Democratic senators on Tuesday unveiled legisl[ation that would bar
state legislatures from]{.underline} banning or [restricting interstate
travel to obtain abortions]{.underline} in states where they are still
allowed. The bill was quickly brought up for a unanimous consent vote on
the Senate floor just days after it was introduced, only to be [blocked
by]{.underline} Republican Sen. James [Lankford]{.underline} (Okla.).

### 2AC -- No PC -- Dem Base

#### No PC -- Biden is unpopular and ineffective -- key young voters, the Senate, inflation, bad communication, and climate change prove 

**Bolton 7/18** -- senior staff writer for The Hill. (Alexander, "Cracks
form in Biden's Senate Democratic base," The Hill, 7-18-2022,
https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3561683-cracks-form-in-bidens-senate-democratic-base/)//
STC

[Cracks are beginning to form in]{.underline} President [Biden's support
among]{.underline} Senate [Democrats]{.underline}, who are becoming less
bullish about him running for reelection in 2024 after recent [polling
shows]{.underline} that [most Democratic voters want a different nominee
in two years]{.underline}.

Senate Democrats say [**Biden's unpopularity is one of their biggest
challenges** heading into the midterm elections and are worried about
data showing that **young Democratic voters**]{.underline}, [whom they
need to turn out in large numbers to win, **are especially
unenthusiastic**]{.underline} about the 79-year-old president.

The relatively cautious and pragmatic members of [the Senate Democratic
Caucus]{.underline} represent the top ranks of the party establishment.
They have been [careful not to criticize Biden during months of a
disappointing stalemate over his signature]{.underline} legislative
agenda, the [B]{.underline}uild [B]{.underline}ack [B]{.underline}etter
framework focused on climate change and social spending.

Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) has urged his colleagues
to stay unified and positive throughout the negotiations and to avoid
criticizing either Biden or centrist Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who on
Thursday again delivered a blow to the measure.

But the **[growing disaffection among Democratic voters with the
president and the direction of the country are becoming impossible to
ignore.]{.underline}**

[A growing number of senators aren't promising to back Biden in 2024 no
matter what]{.underline} --- though they don't want to speak on the
matter publicly.

One Democratic senator who requested anonymity pointed to a recent [New
York Times-Siena College poll showing that **94 percent of Democrats**
under the age of 30 would prefer another Democrat]{.underline} as the
party's standard-bearer [in 2024.]{.underline}

"It shows there's a [strong reservoir of sentiment to bring in a change
of administrations]{.underline}," said the lawmaker, who said the
[midterm election results will be impacted by Biden's low approval
rating.]{.underline}

The senator said "I think we have a shot" to keep the Senate majority,
an optimistic view shared by many Senate Democrats, but warned Biden
will weigh on Democratic candidates and predicted that younger rising
stars will begin to jockey for the party's nomination starting in 2023.

"I think following the midterms we're going to see a number of younger
folks saying we want to be in that conversation, and I don't think
you'll see a complete domination of the primary in the way you might
normally see for an incumbent who's in a strong position," the senator
said.

One of those younger rising stars is California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who
made the rounds with Democratic senators on Capitol Hill Thursday,
further fueling speculation about his presidential ambitions.

[Newsom]{.underline}, 54, was careful not to criticize Biden's age or
his inability to get things done in Washington, but he
[identified]{.underline} what he sees [an inability of Democratic
leaders in the White House and Congress to get their message out
effectively.]{.underline}

He said political leadership is shifting to states such as California
that aren't hampered by the Senate's filibuster rule, which requires 60
votes to pass major legislation.

Newsom said he's proud of the work Biden has done but added "that one of
our challenges" is communicating effectively [with younger
voters.]{.underline}

"**[We are unable to even communicate the basics in an effective
way]{.underline}**," he said. "There are so many things that are being
done, have been done. **[No one believes it, no one knows
it]{.underline}**, and that's a frustration I have fundamentally."

"That's one of my critiques of [the Democratic Party]{.underline},
broadly, is our [incapacity to communicate a positive alternative
agenda, to set the tone]{.underline} and tenor of the agenda
[\[instead\] of being constantly on the defensive,]{.underline}" he
said.

Newsom said he doesn't think Biden's age is the problem, despite polling
data showing that 33 percent of Democratic primary voters who want a new
nominee in 2024 think that [Biden is too old to run for a second
term.]{.underline}

"I'm with Bobby Kennedy. What the world needs is the qualities of youth,
not a time of life," he said. "I think we get so fixated on your date of
manufacture as opposed to your quality of imagination."

Senate Democrats have complained for months about their ineffectiveness
in letting voters know about their accomplishments in the 117th
Congress.

Of course, it's not lost on them that Biden has the bully pulpit and as
president is his party's communicator in chief.

Senate Democrats don't want to publicly question Biden's viability as a
candidate in 2024, but privately they're holding back on endorsing
another White House term until they see how the midterms play out.

"You got to ask me after 2022," said another senator.

The senator said [Biden's numbers and high inflation are "tough" for
Democratic candidates]{.underline} this year but argued that Republicans
failed to recruit top-tier candidates in New Hampshire, Missouri and
Arizona, giving Democrats a better chance of winning races in those
states.

The senator said the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson
Women's Health Organization, which struck down the right to an abortion,
"has injected a completely different dynamic into this" by revving up
Democratic voters ahead of November.

A third Democratic senator didn't want to even touch the subject of
Biden's politically viability, telling The Hill, "I'm not going to do
the politics."

A fourth Democratic senator said Biden's strongest attribute heading
into 2024 is his track record of beating Trump in a head-to-head
election. Polls showing him leading the former president in another
hypothetical match-up.

The New York Times-Siena College poll that showed 64 percent of
Democratic voters want someone other than Biden to be the nominee in
2024 also showed him beating Trump 44 percent to 41 percent.

Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), whose name has been floated as a potential
presidential candidate, said that if Democrats can pass prescription
drug reform through the budget reconciliation process as well as
legislation to improve U.S. competitiveness with China, Biden's numbers
will likely tick up.

He said ["people are unhappy."]{.underline}

"They don't like Trump, they don't like Biden, they don't like
politicians generally right now. People are in a sour mood because of a
lot of things that are beyond the president's control. Inflation is
mostly about the pandemic and corporate CEOs taking advantage of it," he
said.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said **[younger]{.underline}**
Democratic **[voters]{.underline}**, whom polls show are disaffected
with Biden, **[are]{.underline}** understandably **[frustrated
by]{.underline}** the **[Washington's inability to address climate
change.]{.underline}**

"I think [young voters have every reason to be impatient with
Congress]{.underline} generally and I think we have a lot more work we
need to do on climate, and that includes taking a much more aggressive
stance against the climate denial operation that the fossil fuel
industry continues to fund and maintain," he said.

A. The United States uses cluster bombs

The United Nations confirmed on Thursday that nine Afghan civilians had
been killed by controversial weapons. \[\...\] The United States each
day unleashes a little more of its range of weapons against the Taliban
and seems to have gone one step further this week. On the twentieth day
of the bombing of Afghanistan, [[US]{.mark} aircraft]{.underline} are
said to have [dropped [cluster bombs]{.mark} on targets]{.underline}
close to Herat [in the west and on]{.underline} the [fronts]{.underline}
north [of Kabul]{.underline} and near Mazar-i-Sharif. On Thursday a
Pentagon official admitted anonymously that such weapons had been used.
Victims in Herat According to the United Nations spokesperson in
Islamabad, these missiles -- which scatter [hundreds of
bomblets]{.underline} if they open before they touch the ground -- [have
[claimed]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[lives of]{.underline}]{.mark} nine
[[civilians]{.underline}]{.mark} in Herat since the start of the week.
For technical reasons, these [sub-munitions]{.underline}, which are the
size of a soft drink can, do not necessarily explode when they hit the
ground and turn into de facto mines. [One of [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
nine [victims is said to have set off one of these sub-munitions by
handling it.]{.underline} The UN wants explanations The United States'
use of [cluster bombs, a [controversial weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}
which has not been formally prohibited by international treaty, [[has
angered]{.underline}]{.mark} several [[humanitarian
organizations.]{.underline}]{.mark} The [[U]{.mark}nited
[N]{.mark}ations]{.underline}, which is carrying out de-mining campaigns
in Afghanistan, [[asked]{.mark} Washington [for
clarification]{.mark}]{.underline}. The International Committee of the
Red Cross ([ICRC]{.underline}) did not give an opinion. In an "official
statement" issued on Wednesday, it merely [expressed its increasing
concern "about]{.underline} the [impact in humanitarian terms
of]{.underline} the [war in Afghanistan]{.underline}". Darcy Christen,
deputy ICRC spokesman, pointed out that "the ICRC only gives an opinion
about the legitimacy of military means employed as a last resort and
always bases its views on its own intelligence gathered in the field".
Like the other international organizations, the ICRC has evacuated its
expatriate staff from Afghanistan. An ICRC project [[Cluster
bombs]{.underline}]{.mark}, which were last [[used by the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[in
Kosovo]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1999, [[are
controversial]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to a Human Rights Watch
report dated January 2000, in May 1999 the US supreme command issued a
secret order prohibiting their use by its armed forces. Next December in
Geneva, when the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional
Weapons of 1980 is reviewed, the ICRC will propose, among other
recommendations, that it be prohibited to use sub-munitions, including
cluster bombs, against military targets near populous civilian areas. A
bomb which splits into many others \[\...\] Cluster bombs are tubes
which each contain 200 to 300 sub-munitions. Dropped by plane or fired
by the artillery, the bombs release these sub-munitions, each the size
of a soft drink can, at an altitude of between 100 and 1,000 metres.
These sub-munitions can cover an area of 200 metres by 400 metres, the
equivalent of eight football pitches. By scattering shrapnel over a
range of 76 metres, each bomblet has an explosive force capable of
piercing through armour plating, wiping out troop concentrations or
neutralising minefields. Cluster bombs were used during the Viet Nam war
and turn into mines when their sub-munitions do not explode: [according
to NATO, [29,000 sub-munitions did not explode]{.mark} in
Kosovo.]{.underline}

The [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration has
[approved]{.underline} the [[sale of]{.mark} \$735m of
[p]{.mark}recision-[g]{.mark}uided [w]{.mark}eapons]{.underline} to
Israel, [[rais]{.underline}]{.mark}ing the [[ire of]{.mark} some
[Democrats who question support]{.mark}]{.underline} for the government
of Benjamin Netanyahu. The Washington Post reports that Congress was
officially notified of the proposed sale on 5 May, citing three people
familiar with the notification --- a week before the current conflict
with Hamas began. Rockets fired from Gaza into Israel have led to the
deaths of 10 Israelis. Airstrikes on Gaza have left almost 200
Palestinians dead. The [Biden administration has called for a ceasefire
but also maintains]{.underline} that Israel has [the right to defend
itself. While a large majority of Congress backs this position, a
[**growing** minority of Democrats]{.mark}, particularly in the House of
Representatives, have raised [concerns]{.mark} about]{.underline}
supporting Mr Netanyahu and question the timing of [the
sale.]{.underline} Some suggest using the sale as leverage to push for a
ceasefire. "In the past week, the Israeli military\'s strikes have
killed many civilians and destroyed the building that housed the
Associated Press, an American company reporting on the facts in Gaza," a
Democratic lawmaker on the House Foreign Affairs Committee told the
Post. "[[Allowing this proposed sale of smart bombs]{.mark} to go
through]{.underline} without putting pressure on Israel to agree to a
ceasefire [[will only enable further carnage]{.mark}."]{.underline}
After official notification of a weapons sale, Congress has 15 days to
object by way of a non-binding resolution of disapproval. Israel
maintains it uses precision-guided munitions to minimise civilian
casualties, accusing Hamas of using its own people as human shields in
the densely populated Gaza Strip. Given the majority support for Israel
in Congress, it is unlikely that action will be taken to block [the
[sale]{.mark}]{.underline}, but coming during the middle of the current
conflict, it [[has highlighted a growing split in]{.mark} the [Democrat
ranks over]{.mark} the [special treatment]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[ally receives. Younger lawmakers, in particular, are more open to
criticising]{.mark}]{.underline} Israel's [actions,]{.underline} and
this has opened the way for criticism from those that defend the country
as the death toll in Gaza mounts. "I am deeply troubled by reports of
Israeli military actions that resulted in the death of innocent
civilians in Gaza as well as Israeli targeting of buildings housing
international media outlets," said Senator Robert Menendez, chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in a statement over the weekend.
Congressman Mark Pocan of Wisconsin tweeted: "We cannot just condemn
rockets fired by Hamas and ignore Israel's state-sanctioned police
violence against Palestinians --- including unlawful evictions, violent
attacks on protestors & the murder of Palestinian children. [US aid
should not be funding]{.underline} this [violence.]{.underline}" New
York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez labelled Israel an
"apartheid state" on Twitter saying that it could not be considered a
democracy. She also tweeted: "This is happening with the support of the
United States. I don't care how any spokesperson tries to spin this. The
US vetoed the UN call for ceasefire. [If the Biden admin can't stand up
to an ally, who can it stand up to? How can they credibly claim to stand
for human rights?"]{.underline}

human rights record and do more to avoid civilian casualties in the
four-year-long war in Yemen, where the Saudis and UAE are leading an air
campaign against Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Frustration grew after the

the House Foreign Affairs Committee, [urging support for the resolutions
before the vote. Trump wants to retain close ties]{.underline} to
Riyadh, which he considers an important partner in the Middle East and
counterweight to the influence of Iran. Trump also views foreign
military sales as a way to generate U.S. jobs. Officials from his
administration had been unhappy with Democrats in Congress who blocked
the planned sales, in some cases for more than a year, over civilian
casualties in Yemen. Trump announced in May that he would sidestep
congressional review of the military deals, worth more than \$8 billion,
by declaring that the threat from Iran constituted an emergency.
Tensions with Iran have decreased since then, and administration
officials have acknowledged that the military equipment has not been
delivered. Several Republicans joined Democrats in condemning that
decision and voting for the resolutions. However, they would have to
attract far more support in both the Republican-led Senate and House to
garner the two-thirds majorities needed to override Trump's vetoes. But
[lawmakers from [both parties are not dropping the
matter]{.mark}.]{.underline} Several pieces of legislation making their
way through Congress include Saudi-related provisions. And the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee is due to vote on two Saudi-related bills on
Tuesday. One, sponsored by seven Republican and Democratic senators,
includes sanctions to support a peaceful resolution of the Yemen war,
address the humanitarian crisis and hold perpetrators responsible for
murdering Khashoggi. The other would mandate an in-depth review of
U.S.-Saudi policy and bar travel to the United States by many members of
the Saudi royal family.

#### Congress doesn't support funding space projects 

Eric Berger, 6-22-2021, \"Congress isn't happy about SpaceX's lunar
lander and may vent this week,\" Ars Technica,
https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/nasa-administrator-to-defend-lunar-budget-before-a-skeptical-congress/

NASA Administrator Bill Nelson will appear at a committee meeting of the
House Science, Space, and Technology Committee on Wednesday, and the
meeting could be full of intrigue when the subject of NASA\'s Artemis
Program to land humans on the Moon and SpaceX comes up. We can probably
expect some happy talk as Nelson---who as a US Senator in 2011
championed the development of the Space Launch System rocket alongside
Kay Bailey Hutchison---references the recent stacking of the booster\'s
core stage with its solid rocket motors at Kennedy Space Center. After a
decade and more than \$20 billion in costs, NASA\'s large SLS rocket is
indeed finally getting closer to its first test launch. But the real
intrigue will involve the Human Landing System needed as part of the
Moon program to take astronauts down to the lunar surface and back up to
orbit. In April, due in part to a lack of funding from Congress, [NASA
selected
SpaceX](https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/04/nasa-selects-spacex-as-its-sole-provider-for-a-lunar-lander/)
and its Starship vehicle as a sole provider for this critical component
of Artemis. The space agency awarded \$2.89 billion to SpaceX for the
lander. Nelson was formally named NASA administrator shortly after this
award was made. He has supported the contract because he knows it is the
only real chance that NASA has to make a 2024 landing. [But he has
repeatedly asked Congress for more funding so that NASA can support a
second lander contract, either [via the Biden administration\'s jobs and
infrastructure
bill](https://spacepolicyonline.com/news/nelson-sees-jobs-bill-as-solution-to-hls-and-other-funding-needs/)
or as a straightforward budget addition]{.underline}. That latter
suggestion is the route recently taken by [the Senate, which authorized
the addition of \$10 billion to NASA\'s budget as part of the Endless
Frontier Act passed this month. The money would principally fund
development of a second lander, likely the one being designed by a Blue
Origin-led team, as well as some parochial NASA projects that can
[justifiably be described as
pork](https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/legislation-requires-nasa-to-build-sls-test-article-after-initial-flights/).
What makes Wednesday\'s hearing before the House intriguing is that key
US [Representatives]{.mark} have signaled that they [will not
follow]{.mark} the [Senate]{.mark}\'s lead.]{.underline} As part of its
version of the Endless Frontier Act, [the House Science Committee
skipped authorizing funds for a second lunar lander]{.underline}. A US
Representative from Seattle, near where Jeff Bezos\' Amazon and Blue
Origin companies are based, offered a stinging rebuke, [telling The Wall
Street
Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/funding-for-bezos-space-company-fails-to-launch-in-house-11624008601?mod=searchresults_pos1&page=1),
\"[If Jeff Bezos wants to explore space, that's great, but I don't think
he needs federal dollars.\" So it seems clear that [the House will not
just throw more money at NASA]{.mark} for a second lunar lander. At the
same time, the House [is fairly hostile toward]{.mark} SpaceX and
commercial [space.]{.mark}]{.underline} The chair of the House Science
Committee, Dallas Democrat Eddie Bernice Johnson,
[said](https://science.house.gov/news/press-releases/chairwoman-johnson-statement-on-nasas-artemis-human-landing-system-award)
she was \"disappointed\" after NASA selected SpaceX as its sole provider
of a lunar lander in April.

#### Congress has always been divided over the highly controverseial topic of space 

Jeff **Foust**, 7-9-20**20**, \"House Republicans criticize NASA
spending bill,\" SpaceNews,
https://spacenews.com/house-republicans-criticize-nasa-spending-bill/

WASHINGTON --- As the head of NASA emphasized what he saw as bipartisan
support for the agency in Congress, [several Republican members of the
House criticized colleagues for a fiscal year 2021 spending bill they
believe inadequately funds the agency]{.underline}. The commerce,
justice and science (CJS) subcommittee of the House Appropriations
Committee favorably reported a fiscal year 2021 spending bill July 8
that includes \$22.6 billion for NASA. The bill, introduced a day
earlier, passed on a voice vote without any amendments. The bill
rejected a proposed 12% increase in NASA's budget, funding the agency at
the same level as 2020. That request had included \$3.3 billion for the
Human Landing System (HLS) program to develop landers to transport
astronauts to the lunar surface, but the bill provides less than \$630
million for HLS. Rep. José Serrano, chairman of the CJS subcommittee,
made only passing references to NASA in his opening statement about the
bill. "[We reject the president's proposed cuts to climate change
research programs at NASA and NOAA and instead invest in those areas,"
he said. The bill increases NASA Earth science funding by more than
\$250 million from the request. The bill "provides robust funding for
NASA, helping ensure continued American leadership in space," said Rep.
Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.), vice-chair of the subcommittee. Republican
members disagreed. "The flat NASA allocation reveals a determination to
rebuke America's moon-to-Mars Artemis initiative," said Rep. Robert
Aderholt (R-Ala.), ranking member of the CJS subcommittee.]{.underline}
"President Trump rightly wants more funding to reenergize America's
leadership in space, so much so he's willing to pay for it within an
overall austere budget request, and we should follow that lead." Rep.
Kay Granger (R-Texas), ranking member of the full appropriations
committee, contrasted the flat NASA budget with the National Science
Foundation, which received a \$270 million increase from 2020. "There's
not a penny more for NASA," she said, citing in particular the HLS
funding. "The inadequate amount included for our landers undermines
prior years' investments in deep space exploration." "Flat funding for
NASA reveals a deliberate effort to undercut our path to renewed
American space dominance," she continued. "I think this is very
shortsighted, to say the least." That partisan criticism was not limited
to appropriators. "The president's been clear, the vice president's been
clear, we want to get boots on the moon, we want to get the first woman
and the next American man back to the moon by 2024," said Rep. Michael
Waltz (R-Fla.), a member of the House Science Committee, during a
session of the Future Space 2020 conference held online July 8. "There
are those that don't want to see this administration have that victory,"
he claimed. "To me, that's not a win for any administration, that's a
win for the country and a win for global freedom." [That criticism
stands in contrast to comments by NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine,
who has argued that there is bipartisan support for the agency in
Congress]{.underline}. "One of the things that I've done from day one is
build bipartisan consensus for what we're trying to achieve," he said in
an earlier session of the Future Space 2020 conference. "We have to make
sure that NASA, as an agency, maintains bipartisan support and, I would
like to say, even apolitical support." Speaking later in the day at the
NASA Exploration Science Forum meeting online, Bridenstine called the
House bill the "opening salvo" in the debate about NASA's 2021 funding.
"That's not everything that we asked for, but what it shows is there's
bipartisan support for this activity," he said of the HLS funding in
particular. "We can work with the Senate to get more resources as is
necessary to achieve the 2024 landing." Bridenstine criticized
perceptions, which he recalled from his time in the House, that
Republicans supported lunar exploration and human spaceflight, while
Democrats backed Mars missions and science. "These are false narratives
that we have to work every day to unwind, to make sure that we're
looking at our agency as a whole," he said.
