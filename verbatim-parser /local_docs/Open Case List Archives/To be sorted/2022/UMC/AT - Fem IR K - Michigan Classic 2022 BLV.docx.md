#### Socialism and feminism are interconnected and there is still progress to be made on the basis of equality 

Simone **Morgen 14** [For a Feminist Socialism - Democratic Socialists
of America (DSA)
(dsausa.org)](https://www.dsausa.org/democratic-left/for_a_feminist_socialism/)Simone
Morgen is an officer of Democratic Socialists of Central Ohio, a branch
of Democratic Socialists of America. She is a long-time volunteer and
activist with Jobs with Justice and numerous other groups, including
more recently

and immigrant support groupsIn 2012, she was Constituent Liaison at the
State of Ohio - AG office.

Why, indeed? Isn't Rosa Luxemburg a socialist icon? [Don't socialism's
core values of equal treatment of all persons, without prejudice or
disparate treatment, address feminist concerns?]{.underline}

Formally, [yes -- but a cursory examination of the ways in which issues
are addressed even within socialist circles brings this into
question]{.underline}. Even in these more favorable environs, [the need
for an explicitly feminist view remains]{.underline}. After all,
[patriarchy as a sex/gender system of organizing society existed long
before the capitalist mode of production revolutionized society and
colored its directives]{.underline}. **How would feminism change our
common vision?** Most obviously, [feminist socialism recognizes that
work and economics are different for men and women and takes that into
account. Too often, socialists overlook the fact that women's earnings
trail men's for many reasons. These include 1) their greater
representation in low-wage jobs; 2) greater numbers in government jobs,
which have been getting cut due to the recession and attacks on public
sector workers; and 3) lifetime lower earnings, due to a pay
differential that has hardly moved in the past 10 years.]{.underline}
Outside the formal economy, [women also do the vast majority of un-waged
work, whether in the home or the informal economy. A feminist socialist
vision recognizes the immense unpaid labor that sustains the capitalist
economy and the need to address it when developing an alternative, so
that the burden of holding up family and community doesn't fall
disproportionately on women yet again.]{.underline} **Why is [this
critical fact so often overlooked by socialists who lack a feminist
analysis]{.underline}? **

 

First**,**because [identifying specific disadvantaged groups based on
color, country of origin, ethnicity, etc. involves defining those
groupings by their characteristics and often by location and/or
proximity. Women, by contrast, are a worldwide group that encompasses
any or all characteristics, and are always present]{.underline} -- that
is, they are visible and not visible. [This results from their daily
interaction with men as wives, mothers, employees, etc., in both public
and private life, rather than as a discrete racial or ethnic group that
specific people may not encounter on a regular basis. Women are thus not
recognized as a class, either economically or politically.]{.underline}

Second**,**many socialists think in terms of economics but not culture,
whereas [feminists understand that in a patriarchal society, assumptions
regarding women's inferiority to men become so deeply embedded that they
are an unconscious part of our dominant worldview, introduced in
childhood and enforced throughout life. The economic and cultural
limitations under which women live their lives are often simply not
noticed by men and are frequently policed by both men and
women]{.underline} (often subconsciously, sometimes not).

One instance that may illustrate this is [the incredibly misogynous
jokes directed at Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 2008 presidential
election. Racist comments were rightly denounced, but sexist ones didn't
evoke the same reaction.]{.underline} While Clinton and New York mayoral
candidate Christine Quinn are [neoliberal capitalist women, their
treatment demonstrates that women have still not achieved
the]{.underline} (admittedly insufficient) [first stage of making people
uncomfortable with openly misogynous remarks, in the same way that
people often make sure to hide or disguise racial
prejudice.]{.underline} **What does this mean for the struggle for
democratic socialism?** Much as [we simply cannot understand class
without understanding race, so no understanding is complete without an
analysis of how patriarchy intersects with capitalism.]{.underline}
Under [the continuing brutal economic assaults of exploitative
capitalism, many economically disadvantaged men need to have a "lesser"
that can enhance their feelings of worth in an economy and society that
provides limited pathways for their success. Long-established cultural
norms and the needs of the capitalist class combine to reinforce this
devalued position and set expectations for woman's role as helpmate and
supporter rather than as an equal economic actor. Socialists undercut
our own movement by not speaking to the needs of women, who are, after
all, more than half the world.]{.underline}

But [an adequate socialist feminist analysis would move beyond simply
identifying the varying levels of gender disadvantage to a more rigorous
identification of how society is constructed]{.underline}. [As
feminists, we would pay attention to the underlying and unexamined
expectations that shape gender-related questions such as who does
caregiving, how we organize family and private life, what kind of work
confers respect on the worker, etc. We would subject economic,
historical and social patterns to socialist analysis and measure them
against socialist ideals]{.underline}. Finally, [we would analyze how
gender intersects with other categories of identity such as race,
ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and citizenship.]{.underline}

The struggle to [integrate women's experience thoroughly into socialist
theory and practice and to de-emphasize male experience as *the*
paradigm will not be achieved immediately.]{.underline}  [We cannot
erase thousands of years of deeply absorbed assumptions and widely
distributed cultural attitudes in a few generations. We have little
awareness of how ingrained and unconscious these barriers are except for
when that still, small voice occasionally says in a woman's ear "that's
not fair!"]{.underline}  But [socialists cannot allow half of the
population to be an afterthought.]{.underline} While DSAers discuss
reproductive justice in the context of the recent surge in punitive
activity, that and [other feminist issues tend to trail low wages,
immigration, the continuing recession, etc., as a focus of discussion,
and the feminist take on each of these issues is not fully explored.
This must change.]{.underline}

#### The future of labor is women and that entails that women are treated equally throughout the workplace, history shows us the journey that was made for moder women to be in the workforce at all

A century [after the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire, women have become nearly
half of the unionized labor force. They work in the growing service and
public employment sectors as nurses, home attendants, teachers, and
clerks. Previously labeled women's issues---maternity leave, equal pay,
sexual harassment, and work-family balance---have become union
issues]{.underline}. [Women hold leadership positions in the AFL-CIO and
Change to Win. With the disappearance of manufacturing and the growth of
service labor, women of color---both immigrant- and U.S.- born---have
become the driving force in the labor movement for safe jobs, living
wages, and dignity at work, leading women-dominated unions and worker
associations. It is not an overstatement to say that the future of the
labor movement appears up to the women.]{.underline} 1.It hasn't always
been this way. [For at least a century, labor feminists have fought for
the interests of wage-earning women and workingclass housewives, both
within the feminist and the labor movements.]{.underline} Still, [the
priorities of the women's movement for sex-based rights and those of the
labor movement for class solidarity often diverged during the twentieth
century. Working-class feminists struggled against middle-class
feminists who focused primarily on achieving equality with male
professionals and executives. They also battled men who sought to
exclude women from unionized jobs and who denied organized women workers
a full share of power in the labor movement.]{.underline}

Highlighting [key moments when feminists and unionists came together
over the last century, this essay offers a usable past drawn from the
fraught---but often productive---relationship between feminism and
labor.]{.underline} An examination of the contact between organized
women's groups and organized labor, [women's organizations within the
labor movement, and feminist labor organizing shows that when feminists
and unions worked together, both benefited.]{.underline} [Labor gained
when it understood women's issues as crucial for the advancement of the
working class.]{.underline} [The women's movement was at its strongest
when its membership and agenda crossed class lines. Recognition of this
history may help to revitalize feminism as much as organized
labor.]{.underline}

Labor Feminism Before the 1960s: [The Women's Trade Union
League]{.underline}

[The years surrounding 1911's Triangle Shirtwaist Fire saw significant
and broad-based collaboration between labor activists and middle- to
upper-class feminists in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.
[That period began with the creation of the Women's Trade Union League
(WTUL) in 1903.]{.underline} The League, as it was known by its members,
[drew together educated women reformers (mostly white, Protestant, and
native-born) and young women workers (many of them immigrant Jews,
Italians, and Irish) to improve factory wages, working conditions, and
hours.]{.underline} [The WTUL embodied both an unusual degree of
collaboration between feminists and the labor movement, and the many
tensions that arose from longstanding attempts to build lasting and
productive relationships.]{.underline} 2.[This]{.underline} cross-class
[women's network deepened with the uprisings of young women garment
workers that began in New York in 1909 and then spread over the next few
years into other Eastern and Midwestern cities.]{.underline}
Middle-class and affluent supporters of woman suffrage---including
[League activists, college students, and even wealthy socialites---saw
these strikes as an opportunity to win working women to the
cause.]{.underline} Forming what the press dubbed "mink brigades,"
[affluent supporters marched alongside young immigrant women on picket
lines in a largely successful attempt to reduce high rates of police
brutality.]{.underline} After they bailed arrested strikers out of jail,
they spoke (alongside the released strikers) for woman suffrage on the
steps of jails and courthouses. [Affluent feminists brought working
women into existing suffrage organizations, as well as offering
financial support for the establishment of working-class suffrage
groups. Working women understood, as Polish Jewish cap maker Rose
Schneiderman explained in 1907, that they "must . . . secure political
power to shape their own labor conditions."]{.underline} 3.[Women
factory and manufacturing workers knew they needed the political and
financial support of these more affluent "allies."]{.underline}
Nonetheless, imbalances in social power and financial resources
generated much conflict in the first two decades of the century, when
working-class members felt bullied, condescended to, or generally
misunderstood. [While many working-class women embraced socialism and
anarchism, their better-off allies mostly shied away from revolutionary
politics, preferring to reform the existing system. The refusal of
working women to eschew more radical approaches moved affluent women to
withdraw financial support from independent working women's groups,
prompting angry responses.]{.underline} "It is up to the working people
to save themselves," Schneiderman tongue-lashed a theater full of
affluent New Yorkers after the Triangle Fire.4. In the aftermath of the
fire, [women labor activists and reformers redoubled efforts to win the
vote, and industrial feminists (the self-name of labor feminists of that
day) like Schneiderman began to focus as much on passing laws to
regulate wages and labor conditions as they did on union
organizing.]{.underline} [Frances Perkins]{.underline} (the future U.S.
Secretary of Labor under Franklin Roosevelt) of the National Consumers
League [and Pauline Newman]{.underline} (a former Triangle employee and
WTUL activist) [were appointed as investigators for the New York State
Factory Investigating Commission (FIC), positions they used to educate
powerful politicians about the conditions under which working women
labored.]{.underline} Over the next three years, the New York FIC, and
sister organizations in the other industrial states, pushed through a
dramatically expanded regulatory structure for factory labor---including
[laws that empowered state commissioners of labor, banned the labor of
children under the age of fourteen, and required inspection of elevators
and fireproof devices.]{.underline} 5.During World War I, [this
collaboration between middle-class feminists, women labor activists, and
Democratic Party politicians resulted in the founding of a Women in
Industry Service to monitor conditions of women working on defense
contracts.]{.underline} After the war, [President Wilson established a
permanent Women's Bureau in the U.S. Department of Labor to investigate
women's working conditions.]{.underline} Its creation marked the
ascension of "industrial" and "social" feminists to federal government
positions of authority, a significant move toward remaking the state as
a force sympathetic to at least some of the goals of the labor movement.
6.[By the 1920s]{.underline}, when the WTUL came to be run by labor
union women---such as Schneiderman and Newman---[it was genuinely a
cross-class, multi-ethnic organization.]{.underline} Still, once U.S.
women won the right to vote, relations between the self-described
feminists of the National Women's Party (NWP) and women in the labor
movement frayed. [In the early 1920s, NWP leaders began lobbying for an
Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the Constitution, which declared it
unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of sex]{.underline}. [The
labor movement rejected the ERA out of fear that it would negate
hard-won legislation protecting women workers. Ignoring industrial
feminists' pleas to adopt a more piecemeal approach to gender equality,
the NWP introduced the ERA into every session of Congress from 1921 into
the early 1970s, driving a deep and lasting wedge between the labor
movement and feminist activists.]{.underline}

Labor [opponents of the ERA gained the upper hand with the election of
Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. He was, along with his wife Eleanor, a
key ally of the New York WTUL]{.underline}. With [the appointment of
League leaders like Perkins and Schneiderman to key government
positions, FDR signaled support for the goals of the labor-feminist
alliance]{.underline}. [Perkins oversaw the extension of wage-and-hour
and safety protections for all workers, regardless of
gender,]{.underline} through the National Labor Relations Act of 1935
and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938. These laws marked a
turning point for union men who had long been ambivalent toward the idea
of legislating labor conditions. [No longer were strategies for
improving the lives of workers so starkly divided by sex.]{.underline}

Still, [race continued to divide the working class.]{.underline} The
[new legislation intentionally denied coverage to agricultural and
domestic workers---the fields in which most women of color were
employed. Many within the labor-feminist coalition pushed to expand
federal laws]{.underline}, including the Social Security Act of 1935,
[to extend coverage to these occupations. They also expanded the reach
of the labor movement, by supporting organizing drives among service
workers, many]{.underline} of whom [were women of color.]{.underline} In
[reaching out to black and immigrant organizers like Maida Springer
Kemp, Dolly Robinson, and Charlotte Adelman,]{.underline} the mid-1930s
[WTUL brought laundry workers, waitresses, and hotel maids---who had
been largely ignored by white male unionists---into the labor movement.
This same period saw the mass organizing of Caribbean immigrants and
Puerto Ricans in the East, and Mexican-Americans in the
West.]{.underline} These populations [had long been ignored by the
male-led unions.]{.underline}

With [the coming of World War II]{.underline}, largescale [employment of
women in defense plants moved feminist labor issues into the center of
public discussion. Early in the war years, manufacturers attempted to
label any new jobs in defense production as "female" work, enabling them
to pay women workers less than the prevailing union wage.]{.underline}
[Labor leaders' longstanding attempts to keep the best-paid jobs for
white male union members had to be rethought,]{.underline} given the
labor shortages resulting from the wartime draft.
[Reluctantly]{.underline} at first, more enthusiastically
[later]{.underline}, [some unions]{.underline}---most notably the United
Electrical Workers (UE)--- [began to resist sex-based pay
differentials.]{.underline} [Even leaders with little concern for
women's salaries worried that,]{.underline} if they allowed
manufacturers to pay women less during the war, [when men came home
afterwards, it would be difficult to bring wages back up.
Other]{.underline} [unions]{.underline} [retained sex]{.underline}-based
[pay differentials in their contracts,]{.underline} but [in 1942 the
National War Labor Board---responding to years of lobbying by
labor-feminist groups like the WTUL---established]{.underline} a [policy
of equal pay for men and women performing the same jobs. The 1963 Equal
Pay Act,]{.underline} the first time the federal government put its
power behind equal pay for equal work, [was the fruit of continuing
labor-feminist agitation on this issue.]{.underline}

With [wage-earning mothers constituting 36 percent of]{.underline} the
[labor]{.underline} force [by the war's end, work and family
balance]{.underline} inevitably [became an urgent labor
issue]{.underline}. Joint [efforts between feminists and male unionists
mitigated the "double day" with publicly supported child care, flexible
hours, and more convenient shopping options.]{.underline} [Industrial
unions recognized womanpower through special women's committees; the
U]{.underline}nited [A]{.underline}utomobile [W]{.underline}orkers (UAW)
[committee carried forward the labor-feminist agenda into the early
postwar years, in collaboration with the U.S. Women's Bureau. 7.Labor
Feminism Since 1960]{.underline}

[The 1960s and 1970s saw an explosion of interactions between feminists
and trade unionists,]{.underline} and an energetic feminism within the
labor movement. [As women's liberation activists discovered the working
class---with help from World War II-era trade unionists and
leftists---feminist caucuses sprung up within existing
unions.]{.underline} [At its first convention in 1974, thirty-five
thousand women gathered together not "to swap recipes," as Myra Wolfgang
of HERE taunted George Meany and the rest of labor's male
leadership,]{.underline} but to organize the Coalition of Labor Union
Women (CLUW). Along with explicitly feminist groups like the Union
Women's Alliance to Gain Equality (Union WAGE) and 9to5, [CLUW declared
women's issues to be union issues.]{.underline} 8.In honoring [WTUL
stalwart Pauline Newman at its founding meeting, CLUW recognized
generational continuities among labor feminists.]{.underline} [Its
stated priorities explicitly echoed those of the WTUL: strengthening the
role of women in unions; organizing unorganized women; achieving pay
equity; and increasing the involvement of women in the political and
legislative process.]{.underline} But [CLUW added goals that reflected
changing times---promoting affirmative action for women in the
workplace, addressing the concerns of aging women workers, and tackling
substance abuse.]{.underline} In 1980, CLUW president Joyce Miller
became the first woman on the AFL-CIO's executive board---a modest and
long-overdue recognition of the significance of women in the labor
movement.

Trade [union feminists helped launch a revitalized women's movement that
sparked new demands for women's rights at home, on the job, and within
unions.]{.underline} [Clericals, flight attendants, and domestic workers
contested the dominant assumption within the AFL-CIO that women workers
were unorganizable.]{.underline} **[Collective action]{.underline}**
[hit pink-collar occupations.]{.underline} [This]{.underline} trend [was
exemplified by the formation of Stewardesses for Women's Rights, the
Willmar Bank Employees' Association strike in 1977, and the highly
creative and flexible campaign to organize Harvard's clerical and
technical workers. Independent women's associations]{.underline}, like
Chicago's Women Employed, [were far more likely to initiate such efforts
than were traditional labor unions.]{.underline} At a time [when most
unions still concentrated on manufacturing, feminists argued for both
the economic value of women's unpaid labor in the home and the worth of
women's work in service industries.]{.underline} They anticipated the
strategies needed to organize the future economy. 9.At the same time,
[trade union women shaped the new feminism in two ways.]{.underline}
First, [they complicated the meaning of equality by bringing to the
feminist agenda issues like child care and flextime that women needed to
balance wage-earning with family life.]{.underline} [By the 1970s, labor
feminists went beyond an anti-discrimination program to insist that
women's rights at work included pregnancy leave and other labor
standards, and that these issues mattered to the labor movement even if
they did not apply to men.]{.underline} The [World War II efforts of the
International Union of Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers (IUE) laid
the basis for feminist organizing in the 1970s that culminated in the
Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978.]{.underline} [In 1982, twenty
thousand Chinese-immigrant garment workers forced union-sponsored day
care onto the agenda of the labor movement by leaving their babies on
the desk of previously unresponsive garment union president Jay
Mazur.]{.underline} 10.Second, [they had an institutional impact. Not
only would longtime union activists, like Stella Nowicki]{.underline}
from Chicago's stockyards, [become involved with women's liberation---
they also helped birth its most national manifestation.]{.underline} In
1966, Caroline Davis and Dorothy Haener from the UAW's Women's
Department became key founders of the National Organization for Women
(NOW), providing office space and clerical services to that fledging
organization. NOW's co-founder and most famous leader, Betty Friedan,
had learned to organize in the UE. 11[.UAW women were in the forefront
of shifting labor's stand toward the ERA. Like other women in
male-dominated or mixedsex industries]{.underline}---and unlike allies
in the U.S. Women's Bureau---[they viewed women's labor laws not as
protective devices but as tools of both management and hostile male
workers who sought to limit women's opportunities and pay. They
applauded the striking down of sex-based labor restrictions under Title
VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, achieved through the cooperation of
labor and feminist legislators.]{.underline} 12.In the years that
followed, [many local groups bridged the gaps between trade unionism and
the women's movement.]{.underline} 13.In California's Bay Area, two
activists rooted in the old left---Jean Maddox of the militant Local 29
of the Office and Professional Employees International Union and Ann
Draper of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union--- established Union
WAGE in 1971. [They aimed to counter NOW's neglect of working women and
support organizing through rank-and-file movements and independent
associations. The larger women's movement, in turn, influenced WAGE,
which fought for reproductive rights, struggled against sexual
harassment and racism, and condemned discrimination on the basis of
sexual orientation, age, and disability.14]{.underline}

Citywide clerical associations, along with workplace-based women's
caucuses, more typically represented the collective action inspired by
feminist and other radical insurgencies against the AFL-CIO.15 [In the
early 1970s, 9to5 expanded from a consciousness-raising group among
Harvard clerical workers to become (first) an organization of Boston
clerical workers, then part of the National Association of Working
Women.]{.underline} In 1975, [it created a companion union---Local
9to5---that was affiliated with the SEIU. Under the banner "Raises not
Roses," clerical women petitioned, picketed, sued, and engaged in
creative street actions.]{.underline} In the 1990s, founder Karen
Nussbaum brought a feminist perspective to her tenure as director of the
U.S. Women's Bureau and, in 1996, as the head of the AFL-CIO's new
Working Women's Department.16

[Feminists also established caucuses within established unions. Among
the most effective, the District 31 (based in Northwest Indiana's
Calumet Region) Women's Caucus of the United Steelworkers
mobilized]{.underline} "burly" [men to march for the ERA in Illinois, a
major industrial state resisting ratification.]{.underline} [It joined
with]{.underline} a [multiracial]{.underline} coalition of Chicago-area
[women's groups to fight against job discrimination and violence against
women and for abortion rights.]{.underline} It also defended women's
jobs during layoffs.17

In the early 1970s, black feminist leaders Shirley Chisholm and Eleanor
Holmes Norton sought to jointly mobilize the civil rights, labor, and
women's movements to improve the conditions of domestic service. While
the AFL-CIO still could not imagine organizing such workers, its members
joined a cross-class and multiracial mix of feminists in supporting the
1974 expansion of the Fair Labor Standards Act to cover domestic
workers. With the support of the National Committee on Household
Employment, a black feminist organization initially founded by labor
feminists, domestic workers themselves mobilized as the Household
Technicians of America (HTA) in 1972. Given the stigma associated with
domestic service, local groups across the nation sought not only
traditional bread-and-butter improvements but also respect for their
work and humanity through written contracts, public recognition
ceremonies, and training and education programs.18

Las Vegas became a surprising base for labor feminism when a multiracial
workforce of hotel maids turned the city's Hotel and Culinary Workers
Union Local 226 into the largest private union local in the United
States in the 1990s. Beginning in the 1940s, AfricanAmerican women
assumed leadership roles. In the 1950s, under pioneering business agent
Sara Hughes, black women who labored as "back of the house" workers in
the city's hotels and casinos became organized. But, twenty years later,
African-American workers contested the union's collaboration with hotel
management to segregate them into the lowest wage positions in the hotel
workforce. A series of protests and court challenges yielded a federal
consent decree forcing the union and Las Vegas hotels to train and place
women and workers of color into higher-paid jobs. In the late 1980s, the
union's multiracial membership ratified some of the best contracts in
the nation for service workers. This period of success for unionized
women of color culminated in 1990 when Hattie Canty---a black migrant
mother of ten---became president of the Culinary Union.19

Toward the Future

The relationship between the women's movement and organized labor has
shifted over the last twenty-five years. The AFL-CIO has incorporated
major concerns of wage-earning women into its formal agenda, calling
for: equal pay, work and family balance, and prevention of violence
against women in the workplace. Middle-class feminists played a role in
pushing unions to recognize these concerns, but too often they ignored
how class structures the outcome of gender inequality, as in questions
of remuneration, time flexibility, and the double day. While feminists
of all classes easily embraced equal pay, middleclass people are less
active in seeking redress for underpaid caregivers. Jamaican immigrant
Evelyn Coke---the Long Island home care worker whose exclusion from the
minimum wage law the SEIU litigated---garnered meager feminist support
for her plight. On the other hand, feminists gave crucial support to new
formations---like Domestic Workers United in New York City and other
ethnically-based associations---that seek dignity and recognition as
well as better working conditions. These efforts culminated in September
2010 when New York became the first state to adopt a Domestic Worker
Bill of Rights.20

Most significantly, [women have become the new face of labor, composing
the majority of union recruits. As manufacturing declined and the
service economy exploded, immigrant women in low-wage jobs brought a new
vitality and militancy to unionization]{.underline}. The numbers of jobs
in teaching, nursing, and clerical work that employed more women than
men continued to grow right up to the beginnings of the current
recession, increasing women's percentage of the unionized workforce. In
service industries, women now make up half of all unionists. Their
numbers have begun to close the overall membership gap.21

[While unions once saw women as unorganizable, today they count on them.
Examples range across the labor force, but concentrate in the health
care sector.]{.underline} Most of the seventy-four thousand Los Angeles
home aides who voted to join the SEIU in 1999 were women. The
150,000-strong National Nurses United, formed in 2009 from three nurses
groups, became the nation's largest union of medical professionals.22
Though the numbers of women in leadership positions are nowhere near
parity, Mary Kay Henry replaced Andy Stern as the head of the SEIU in
2010. Linda Chavez-Thompson served as executive vice-president of the
AFL-CIO for over a decade, and then was replaced by another AFSCME
(American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees) leader,
Arlene Holt Baker. And, in 2009, Liz Shuler of the IUE became the first
woman elected as the federation's secretary-treasurer.

[Women of color---many of them immigrants---have spearheaded fights
against today's sweatshops in the fields and in homes, and have
organized workers in food processing and garment
production.]{.underline} They have revived hotel worker militancy, as
evidenced by HERE's ongoing Hotel Workers Rising initiative and Boston
chambermaids' protest against the Hyatt chain.23 Joined by middle-class
feminist allies---some of whom were from the same ethnic group (as with
Asian Immigrant Women Advocates)---they are addressing workplace
conditions and occupational safety issues that represent today's
equivalent to the hazards of a century ago, including carpel tunnel
injuries and industrial fires. [In the 1990s, Mexicana farm workers of
Líderes Campesinas investigated the impact of pesticides on pregnancy
and highlighted sexual harassment as well as the continued low wages
paid for work in California's fields.]{.underline}24 [Worker
centers---like the Garment Worker Center in Los Angeles and many
others---are linking feminism, immigrant rights, and worker justice on a
daily basis in working-class communities.25]{.underline}

[A century ago, the Triangle Fire horrified New York City and the nation
as a whole, forcing the labor movement, feminists, and political
reformers to more systematically address the murderous conditions facing
American workers. Over the years, feminists and trade unionists came
together in numerous ways, engaging in vibrant coalitions that enabled
them to transcend their differences.]{.underline} [Today's labor
movement has become, in large measure, a women's movement.]{.underline}
Whether it will stay that way remains to be seen. Is the feminization of
the labor movement yet another indicator of its decline? Or is it a
harbinger of labor's renewal? One hundred years after Triangle that

#### Radical feminism and socialism both agree women are oppressed by capitalist society. The ultimate goal for feminism is to embrace socialism. 

**Aschoff 18- (**Nicole, PhD in sociology, senior editor for Verso Book,
*Feminism Againist Capitalism,* Publisher: JACOBIN)

So while itis certainly necessary to recognize how gendered contemporary
society remains, [it is also necessary to be clear-eyed about how to
overcome these divides and, equally important,to recognize the
limitations of a feminism that **doesn't challenge
capitalism. **]{.underline}

**[Capital feeds on existing norms of sexism, compounding the
exploitative nature of wage work.]{.underline}** When women's ambitions
and desires are silenced or undervalued,they are easier to take
advantage of. Sexism is part of the company toolkit, enabling firms to
pay women less--- particularly women of color--- and otherwise
discriminate against them.

[But even if we root out sexism,the inherent contradictions of
capitalism will persist. It is important and necessary that women step
into positions of power, but this won't change the fundamental divide
between workers and owners]{.underline}--- between women at the top and
women at the bottom. 

It won't change the fact that most women find themselves in precarious,
low-wage jobs that present a far greater barrier to advancement and a
comfortable life than sexism in the economic or political sphere. It
won't change the power of the profit motive and the compulsion of
companies to give workers as little as economic, social, and cultural
norms will allow.

 Of course, society is not reducible to the wage relation, and gender
divides are real and persistent. [Taking class seriously means anchoring
the oppression of women within the material conditions in which they
live and work while recognizing the role of sexism in shaping both
women's work life and their home life. ]{.underline}

The feminist movement--- both its "social-welfare" incarnation and its
radical contemporary--- has made significant gains. The [challenge now
is twofold:to defend these hard-won victories and make it possible for
all women to actually enjoy them, and to push forward with new, concrete
demands that address the complex relationship between sexism and
profit-making. ]{.underline}

There is no simple answer to how to accomplish these twin goals. In the
past, women have made the biggest gains by fighting for both women's
rights and workers' rights simultaneously--- linking the fight against
sexism to the fight against capital. 

As Eileen Boris and Anelise Orleck argue, during the 1970s and '80s,
"trade union feminists helped launch a revitalized women's movementthat
sparked new demands for women's rights at home, on the job, and within
unions." Airline stewardesses, garment workers, clericals, and domestic
workers challenged the male-dominated trade union movement(a woman
didn't sit on the AFL-CIO executive board until 1980) and in the process
forged a new, more expansive feminism. 

[Trade union women created a new field of possibility by demanding not
only higher wages and equal opportunity but also child care, flexible
work schedules, pregnancy leave, and other gains usually overlooked or
undervalued by their union brothers. ]{.underline}

[This is the direction that both socialists and feminists should be
orienting themselves--- toward struggles and demands that challenge both
the drives of capital and the ingrained norms of sexism that are so
deeply rooted under capitalism.]{.underline}

 Struggles and demands that achieve this are concrete and are currently
being fought for. For example,the struggle for single-payer
healthcare--- which would provide healthcare as a right to every person
from cradle to grave regardless of their ability to pay--- is a demand
that undermines both sexism and the power of capital to control and
repress worker agency. [There are many other concrete short-term demands
that blend the goals of feminism and socialism as well, including free
higher education, free child care, and a universal basic income combined
with a robust social safety net.]{.underline}

[ These reforms would lay the groundwork for more radical goals that
would go far in rooting out sexism, exploitation, and the
commodification of social life.]{.underline} For example, projects to
increase collective, democratic control over institutions central to our
home, school, and work lives--- schools, banks, workplaces, city
governments, and state and local agencies---would give all women and men
more power, autonomy, and the possibility for a better life. 

This anticapitalist strategy is one that contains the possibility for
the radical change that women need. 

**[Ultimately the goals of a radical feminism and socialism are the
same--- justice and equality for all people, not simply equal
opportunity for women or equal participation by women in an unjust
system.]{.underline}**
