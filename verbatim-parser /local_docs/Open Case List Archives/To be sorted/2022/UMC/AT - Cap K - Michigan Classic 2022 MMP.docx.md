One of the [standard justifications for socialism is the claim that it
will free workers from domination by their bosses. After the revolution
comes, working people will no longer have to cater to the arbitrary
whims of capitalists or their managerial lackeys]{.underline}. Anyone
who has ever had to put up with a mean or incompetent boss can readily
see the intuitive appeal of this idea. The intuition is backed by the
ideas of [\"non-domination\"
theorists](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/republicanism/#LibNonDom)
(not all of them socialists), who emphasize the importance of freedom
from the arbitrary control of others. [Even if the victim of domination
has a high material standard of living, they argue, she has still
suffered a grave injustice]{.underline}. Thus, even the best-paid
employees of capitalist firms still labor under the domination of the
boss. Some non-dominationists add the point that this is true even if
the boss\'s dictates are always reasonable and he never abuses his
authority. [The mere fact that he could wield arbitrary power over you
if he wanted to, is enough to make you a victim of
subordination.]{.underline} Socialism would, it is claimed, put an end
to this grave injustice. In a recent [guest
post](https://betonit.substack.com/p/socialism-doesnt-liberate-workers)
at Bryan Caplan\'s \"Bet on It\" blog, political philosopher
[Christopher Freiman takes issue with the non-domination
rationale]{.underline} [for socialism. While it may free workers from
the potential domination of bosses, **it exposes them to worse abuses at
the hands of fellow workers**:]{.underline} \[I\]magine that Alice is
living under capitalism and owns a restaurant. She has somewhat
puritanical sensibilities and doesn\'t like the look of her employee
Tate\'s new tattoo. However, she would suffer a significant material
cost if she acted on her anti-tattoo bias and fired him---namely, the
loss of a productive employee. So even though Alice doesn\'t like
tattoos, she has an economic incentive to grit her teeth and keep Tate
on board. Indeed, it\'s plausible for [Becker-type
reasons](https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v3-36-849/) that if
Alice does start making hiring and firing decisions on the basis of
occupationally-irrelevant considerations like tattoos, she\'ll lose
productive workers to competitors and see her business languish as a
result. The system as a whole will punish arbitrariness even if a
particular employer indulges in it. Now suppose Alice is living in a
socialist society that\'s characterized by democratically-run,
worker-controlled cooperatives. She still doesn\'t like tattoos and
Tate---now her fellow worker-owner---still decides to get one. As an
individual worker-owner in the cooperative, Alice can cast a vote to
fire Tate. Notice that her material incentive to not indulge her
anti-tattoo bias is much weaker in this scenario. [Under
capitalism]{.underline}, Alice\'s [decision about]{.underline} Tate\'s
employment is decisive---if she wants him fired, he\'s fired.
Consequently, a[n arbitrary decision comes with a **100% chance of
losing a high-productivity employee** and taking money out of her own
pocket.]{.underline} However, under socialism, even if Tate is
productive and firing him would make Alice worse off economically, it
may still be rational for her to vote to fire him to
[express](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#OtheReasVote) her
distaste for tattoos. [The vote, unlike the firing decision in the
capitalist scenario, is not decisive---it comes with a much smaller
chance of actually resulting in Tate\'s termination]{.underline}. Since
there is a comparatively low chance that her vote to fire Tate will get
him fired, [the vote has a comparatively low material cost to
Alice---making it more likely that she\'ll cast it]{.underline}. [And
the point holds for all of the other worker-owners, meaning this is a
cooperative-wide problem.]{.underline} (It\'s true that Tate also gets a
vote, but a single vote isn\'t much of a safeguard against domination.)
While socialists claim that collectivization will liberate workers from
the whims of their bosses, [they tend to ignore how collectivization
subjects workers to the whims of other workers. Indeed, worker-owners
have stronger incentives than capitalist employers to make arbitrary
decisions, so **we should expect arbitrary decisions to be more
prevalent under socialism than capitalism**.]{.underline} Freiman\'s
point can be extended in several ways. First, the dynamic he identifies
becomes worse with increasing size. [The larger the number of workers
employed by any given enterprise, the smaller the significance of any
given vote in the cooperative assembly, and the greater the voters\'
incentive to indulge various prejudices.]{.underline} At the same time,
the larger the electorate, the less the chance that any potential victim
of those prejudices will be able to exercise enough influence to change
the outcome. In Chapter 1 of my book [Free to Move: Foot Voting,
Migration, and Political
Freedom](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0197618774/reasonmagazinea-20/),
I explain in greater detail how these dynamics ensure that democratic
processes generally fail to solve the problem of domination, and may
even exacerbate it. The [danger of worker domination under socialism is
exacerbated if the socialist system in question is one where enterprises
are controlled not by their employees, but by the
government]{.underline} - even a democratically elected one. In that
event, [the individual worker has even less chance of influencing the
rules she must live under.]{.underline} And [those rules
apply]{.underline} not just to one enterprise - which dissatisfied
employees can quit - but [to every workplace throughout the
economy]{.underline}. In that scenario, [workers with minority
preferences are likely to be far more thoroughly dominated]{.underline}
than in almost any other. In the real world, of course, \"[democratic\"
socialism is [highly likely to devolve into
dictatorship](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/11/07/lessons-from-a-century-of-communism/),
as has happened with **every large-scale experiment in socialism
throughout history**]{.underline}. Workers throughout the nation then
end up subject to the whims of a much smaller, and more centralized
clique of bosses who - unlike capitalists - don\'t have to compete for
labor. Dissenting workers are lucky if they only get fired or demoted,
as opposed to executed or sent to the Gulag. As Freiman implies, the
best safeguard against domination by bosses is the right of exit,
combined with competition. If the boss makes arbitrary and unreasonable
demands, she risks losing productive workers to her rivals. At the very
least, she will have to pay good workers a higher salary to retain them.
An employee who can say \"no\" to the boss by quitting has far more
meaningful freedom from domination than one whose only recourse is, say,
a 1 in 1000 chance of influencing the outcome of the next vote at the
Workers Assembly. Such exit mechanisms are far from perfect. But they
are vastly preferable to socialist alternatives. And, as Freiman also
notes, much can be done to increase mobility and competition in existing
capitalist systems, most notably breaking down barriers such as
[occupational
licensing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/12/12/how-occupational-licensing-laws-inhibit-interstate-mobility/)
and [exclusionary
zoning](https://reason.com/volokh/2021/04/28/a-cross-ideological-case-for-ending-exclusionary-zoning/),
which make it harder for workers to seek out new opportunities. Finally,
it\'s worth emphasizing that, [if worker cooperatives are as wonderful
as advocates claim, **free market systems are entirely compatible with
them**.]{.underline} Nothing prevents people from setting up enterprises
run by such collectives. Indeed, [they have existed in \"capitalist\"
societies for many decades now. If democratic cooperatives really do
treat employees better than conventional bosses, **that should give them
important competitive advantages** over the latter in attracting
productive workers]{.underline}. They wouldn\'t have to pay as high
wages to get the best people. And their happier workforces should be
more productive, as a result, thereby increasing their competitive edge
even more. The fact that cooperatives don\'t seem to be successful in
most sectors of the economy is a sign they may not be as great as
enthusiasts claim. Either they don\'t actually diminish domination of
workers (perhaps for the reasons Freiman notes), or employees care more
about things like pay and benefits than they do about non-domination.
Some might even prefer a workplace where management is handled by the
boss (or her specialized agents), because they find spending time on
governance unpleasant and boring. As Oscar Wilde famously [put
it](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7499001-the-trouble-with-socialism-is-that-it-takes-up-too),
\"the trouble with socialism is that it takes up too many evenings.\"
Regardless, the existence of \"socialist\" enterprises in capitalist
societies further expands exit options for workers, and further
diminishes the risk of domination by bosses. By contrast, a socialist
society cannot readily accommodate conventional \"capitalist\" firms -
at least not without ceasing to be socialist if the capitalist firms
begin to outcompete their cooperative rivals. In sum, exit rights, not
socialism are the best antidote to overbearing bosses. And if you are a
non-domination theorist, they are also a far better solution to the
problem of arbitrary power than is democratic governance.
