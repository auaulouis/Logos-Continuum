[[Energy is essential for the production]{.mark} and movement [of
"things".]{.mark}]{.underline} Using an assemblage of [machines the
industrial revolution exponentially increased the energy available to
human society]{.underline}; however, such machinery required human
supervision and control to attain its objectives. There are basically
three "ideal types" of machines: those that convert matter from one form
of matter to another; those that convert energy from one form of energy
to another; and, those that exchange information[. Cybernetics deals
with the latter. In that sense, the Internet may be conceived of as an
immense machine encompassing the breadth and length of the planet that
has the real-time capacity to interconnect and put in common all of
human kind, an embryonic global civil society]{.underline}. The next
evolutionary leap is now underway[, the Internet of things (IoT) which,
as inferred from its name, will permit the connection of "things" to
each other as well as to human beings implying that, like today's
[cybernetic machines]{.mark}]{.underline}, "[things" [will soon possess
a degree of "intelligence"]{.mark}]{.underline}. In conjunction with
certain functions (e.g., the capture, recording and transmission of
information), such [[intelligence will equal or exceed that of
humans]{.underline}]{.mark}. Based on the foregoing, what Karl Marx's
anticipated as a "social brain" is emerging before our own eyes. Since
ancient times, humans and things have formed a single system (human
society) comprised of a single socio-technical object in the sense
defined in actor-network theory (ANT) by Michel Callon and Bruno
Latour.[1](javascript:void(0)) In the latter, humans provided the desire
and intelligence and "things" the energy and transformation of matter,
even if 'us" and "them", [humans and machines did not intercommunicate
(converse). Now]{.underline}, [however, [a subtle disruption is
occurring as "things" begin to acquire]{.mark} varying degrees of
[intelligence]{.mark} and thus conversation and a new kind of synergy
appears plausible]{.underline}. Such disruption was anticipated by Marx
in his famous Fragment on Machines (1857) where he wrote: "The
accumulation of knowledge and skills of the general productive forces of
[the social brain is thus absorbed within capital."]{.underline} (Marx,
1980, p.220). There (see Notebook VI-VII of the Grundrisse), in what he
referred to as "general intellect" or the "social brain", the German
philosopher anticipated the process through which [vampire like [capital
has imbibed knowledge]{.mark} and abilities from the productive forces
of society, violently extracting[2](javascript:void(0)) it [from its
workers]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to Marx, such extraction in the
form of the class struggle has shaped the history of that which is real,
i.e., "the material world reflected by the human mind, and translated it
into forms of thought".[3](javascript:void(0)) Insofar, this conception
of the human brain as a generic or social being, is precisely what is
fundamental for the derivation of a theory of knowledge (epistemology)
from the theory of value, which means one basic thing: that the brain
"is" social.[4](javascript:void(0)) Today, such reality is referred to
as "virtual reality" or "Big Data" although it would be more accurate to
refer to it as "encrypted reality".[5](javascript:void(0)) The
privatization of Big Data (or the social brain) explains how Silicon
Valley's media stars now dominate the world. In the words of Slavoj
Žižek: [How did [Bill Gates]{.mark}]{.underline} become the richest man
in America? [His [wealth]{.mark} has nothing to do with Microsoft
producing good software at lower prices than its competitors, or
"exploiting" its workers more successfully]{.underline} (Microsoft pays
its intellectual workers a relatively high salary). Millions of people
still buy Microsoft software because [Microsoft has [imposed
itself]{.mark} as an almost universal standard, practically
[monopolizing the field, as]{.mark} one embodiment of what [Marx called
the "general intellect]{.mark}", by which he meant collective knowledge
in all its forms, from science to practical knowhow]{.underline}.
[[Gates effectively]{.underline} [privatized part of the general
intellect]{.underline}]{.mark} and became rich by appropriating the rent
that followed. (Žižek 2012, 146).

#### The impact is cybernetic civil war

[When such privatization reaches its final stages, [capital will require
very little living labor for its reproduction]{.mark}]{.underline}. By
then, without state intervention, [the risk will be that most workers
will be hurled into the hell of unemployment and
instability]{.underline}. However, in doing so, capital will have
undermined its own foundation, "[[surplus value", which can only be
created by]{.mark} "[living]{.mark} labor]{.underline}". In Marx's
words: "Capital thus works in favor of its own dissolution as the
dominant form of production." (Marx 1980, 222) More recently, Stephen
Hawking, [the famous British astrophysicist, drew our attention to the
same phenomenon[: If machines produce everything we need, the outcome
will depend on how things are distributed]{.mark}. Everyone can enjoy a
life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or
else, [most people]{.mark} [can end up miserably poor if the
machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth
redistribution]{.mark}.]{.underline} So far, [the trend seems to be
toward the second option with technology driving ever-increasing
inequality]{.underline}. \[Emphasis added\] (Hawking, 2015). If
Hawking's prediction comes true we will arrive at a situation where
virtually every product will be machine made with little if any living
labor involved. But, as pointed out by Bruno Milanovic (2015): "Isn't
this in some ways ... very similar, to Marx's process of increased
"organic composition of capital" eventually leading to capitalism's
euthanasia (to use Keynes' term in a Marxist framework)??" According to
Milanovic, a former chief economist of the World Bank, [Marx's
assumption is that the process of valorization implies intensification
of capital relative to living labor. Thus, capitalists tend to
accumulate more and more capital and to eliminate more and more living
labor per unit of output]{.underline}. In a Marxist framework, this
means a constant diminishing need for payed salary per hour which
obviously generates consistently less surplus value. Such diminishing
surplus value in inverse relation to increasing capital accumulation
means a reduction in the rate of profit until it plummets to zero. [How
then will robotization affect capitalism?]{.underline} Karl Marx gives
us some clues[. As he wrote, each individual capitalist is constrained
by the iron laws of the market to invest in increasingly
capital-intensive processes to attain a competitive edge over other
capitalists; however, when they all do the same, (ignoring
counter-tendencies), the benefit rate diminishes for all of
them]{.underline}. Thus, in the long term, when all is said and done,
capitalists "withdraw from business" or, more precisely, move towards a
zero rate of profit. In any case, living labor will be replaced by
machines to such an extreme degree that the bulk of production will be
carried out robotically. Employment will become insignificant. According
to Marx, the ultimate political imbalance -- or terminal crisis -- would
take place between a vast "reserve army of unemployed workers" and a
thin layer of capitalists and successful wage earners. To visualize this
imbalance, Milanovic (2015) invites us to ... [\[I\]magine thousands of
robots working in a big factory with only one worker checking them out,
and with the useful life of robots being one year so that you keep on
replacing robots continuously and thus run enormous depreciation and
reinvestment costs every year.]{.underline} The composition of GDP would
be very interesting. If total GDP is 100, we could have consumption=5,
net investment=5 and depreciation=90. You would live in a country with
GDP per capita of \$500,000 but \$450,000 of that would be depreciation.
Suppose now that following a Cybernetic ​​Civil War, -similar to the one
recreated in the film V for Vendetta-- and led by a global network of
anti-system "hacktivists", [machines become the property of the
unemployed and of the other disenfranchised of the system. The same
enormous factories crowded with thousands of robots would be retained
but their entire net product would be appropriated by the unemployed,
who would use the income to facilitate a life of leisure with reduced
working hours or perhaps none]{.underline}: gazing at screens and
playing entertaining games on their laptops. [Thus, [cybernetic civil
war would be a displaced class struggle.]{.mark}]{.underline} What,
however, would be the "ideology" of the new cybernetic proletarians?
Perhaps an invigorated "digitized fetishism" or perhaps, "the kingdom of
freedom" as Marx hypothesized? In the words of Ricardo Sanín-Restrepo
(2016): [The wondrous [machines]{.mark} of technology and communication
[are programmed in]{.mark} highly sophisticated languages and in
extremely [elitist environments]{.mark} that are instrumental for the
domination of capital at its best]{.underline}. Even though we are
connected irremediably in a network of ever-extending information, as a
General Intellect, [the cultural language of the machine remains
encrypted: its flows and commands are still dependent on the hunger of
the market, and its core intellect remains a highly scarce
material]{.underline}. Hence, in[formation can only become democratic
when the machine---as a point of absorption of power-knowledge---is
itself decrypted and politically liberated]{.underline}. "Wondrous
[[machines]{.mark}"]{.underline} which, while embodying a great promise
of human emancipation, still [[continue to
replicate]{.underline}]{.mark} in their "[flows and commands" the same
moral baseness: racism, sexism, imperialism, capitalism, of the
political matrix that bred life into them: [Globalized
Coloniality]{.mark} These are the great and disturbing challenges with
which globalized coloniality and its encrypted reality confront
us.]{.underline}

Up to [now [the world's most developed cybernetic societies]{.mark},
[Estonia, Singapore and Israel]{.mark}, [have been]{.mark}: (1)
demographically small and [politically homogeneous]{.mark}; (2) [possess
very strong police states; and]{.mark} (3), [view]{.mark} widespread
[elitist education as a state and societal
priority]{.mark}]{.underline}. Interestingly, because these societies
are incongruously distant from California, the idiotic myth that
"everything is invented by Silicon Valley" is being
discredited.[6](javascript:void(0)) However, a transition point seems to
be approaching. In a new twist on [the current Cybernetic World War (a
digital reprint of the Cold War between East and West), during the St.
Petersburg International Economic Forum in early June of 2017 Vladimir
Putin announced a qualitatively new political program which, judging by
the speeches, will involve [the]{.mark} full "[digitization]{.mark}"
[of]{.mark} Russian [society]{.mark} and of the Russian economy which
they plan to extract from their formidable schools of mathematicians and
physicists]{.underline}. During that forum Putin and his ministers
announced an alliance with Ethereum, a decentralized Internet services
system based on Blockchain technology, the technology on which
"cryptocoins" are grounded. The technology comprises interconnected
nodes of encrypted information distributed throughout the world,
functioning as both databases and security backup mechanisms. According
to the Kremlin, President Putin met with the founder of Ethereum,
Vitálik Buterin, a 23-year-old Canadian born programmer of Russian
decent. Mr. Putin was enthusiastic about Mr. Buterin's ideas and
arranged for contacts with potential Russian partners. The press release
on the meeting disclosed that: According to Russian \[First Deputy\]
Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, Putin is "passionate" about the concept of
digitization of the economy and new technologies. He said the president
brought together a small group of administration and government
officials to discuss these issues and only "permitted them to leave"
after "one in the morning." In St. Petersburg, Putin outlined the basics
of the digitalization program the government has developed on its own.
Among its goals is "general digital literacy" with "teaching curricula
for people of all ages" and a "new and agile normative basis for
introducing digital technologies in all fields", taking into account
"the informational security of the State, businesses and citizens."
Putin announced actions "[to increase our intellectual, technological
and professional superiority in the field of the digital
economy".]{.underline} In his opinion, "the groundbreaking schools in
the fields of mathematics and theoretical physics" allow Russia "to
achieve leadership in different sectors of the so-called new economy,
especially the digital economy." [The digital economy is no longer a
branch but rather, "[the basis for creating new]{.mark} qualitative
business, [commerce]{.mark}, logistics and [production models]{.mark},
which change [education]{.mark}, health, state management [and]{.mark}
communication formats between people and which consequently
[create]{.mark} new [development paradigms for the State]{.mark}, the
economy and society as a whole]{.underline}", argued Putin. Bonet in "El
País", (2017). Might not Putin's strategy encompass the possibility that
we find ourselves at the gates of what Alain Badiou has articulated as
the "Event": an intervention that cannot be accounted for in terms of
its preexisting "objective conditions"? With Blockchain technology in
play, societal wealth is being transformed, not only from an "immense
accumulation of commodities" (Marx) towards an immense planetary
synapse, but because of its revolutionary mathematical
structure,[7](javascript:void(0)) [it could also alter the traditional
geometries of global power]{.underline}. Consider: What if in the near
future Russia, China and India successfully duplicate Estonia, Singapore
or Israel's digitalization models[? It will, of course, involve an
escalation of [the Cybernetic ​​World]{.mark} War with the principal
Western Powers]{.underline}. Nonetheless, because [they [are]{.mark}
[all]{.mark} [police]{.mark} and [capitalist states with]{.mark} opaque,
[corrupt oligarchies]{.mark} entrenched in positions commanding both
[the economy and the administration, hacktivists]{.mark}, whether from
the [East or West, the North or South]{.mark}, [will]{.mark} face the
[challenge]{.mark} of transforming [the Cybernetic World War into a
Cybernetic Civil War through the socialization of
databases]{.mark}]{.underline},[8](javascript:void(0)) i.e., decrypting
Big Data and freeing all the potentia of its collective artificial
intelligence from its current hijackers: both state (e.g., the United
States, the European Union, Russia, China, etc.) and private (e.g.,
Google, Facebook, Netflix, Microsoft, Apple, etc.).

[Life and [society worldwide have been transformed by digital
technology]{.mark}, [including the fabrics of emotional
relationships]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Many]{.mark} believed the internet
would]{.underline} be the largest ungoverned space in the world with
unlimited emancipatory potential, and [t[rusted Big Tech to make the
world a better place. Yet power]{.underline}]{.mark} [and capitalism
[filled that space with surveillance systems]{.mark}, the production of
private capital, [the monetization of data, and the control of human
lives]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Social media now shape daily life and many
have lost faith in the possibility of a shared consensus
reality.]{.underline} We are living in a scenario similar to one
imagined by Black Mirror: [our belief in [digital communication]{.mark}
and social media creates narcissistic personalities, selves dissociated
and dislocated from their reflections online. Digital communication
of[fers an opaque mirror that delivers egos without bodies]{.mark},
eliding alterity]{.underline}. [The collapse of reality, however, is not
an unintended consequence of advancements in, for instance, artificial
intelligence: it was the long-term objective of [many
technologists]{.mark}, who [sought to create machines capable of
transforming human consciousness]{.mark} (like drugs do).]{.underline}
[[Communication has become a site for the extraction of surplus
value]{.mark}, and images operate as both commodities and dispositives
for this extraction]{.underline}. Moreover, [[data mediates our
cognition]{.underline}]{.mark}, that is to say, the way in which we
exist and perceive the world and others. The image---and the unlimited
communication promised by constant imagery---have ceased to have
emancipatory potential. [[Images]{.underline} [place a veil
over]{.underline}]{.mark} [a world in which [the isolated living
dead]{.mark}, thirsty for stimulation and dopamine, give and collect
likes on social media.]{.underline} Platform users exist according to
the Silicon Valley utopian ideal of life's complete virtualization. The
internet, moreover, has radically changed the political communications
game and must be considered a complex propaganda apparatus. Although a
single Tweet can destroy someone's career, and fake news can start a
real news cycle, meaning is subordinate to the circulation of vacuous
content. [The capitalist capture of data for profit does]{.underline}
not rely on policing content; the production of capital only [relies on
the constant exchange and circulation of information]{.underline}. We
don't yet know the full extent of the manipulation of companies such as
Facebook, Google, and Amazon in the last two elections in the US or in
other elections around the world. [But it is undeniable that [digital
platforms]{.mark} are actively censoring content in the interests of
particular political actors]{.underline}. For instance: in October 2020,
[Zoom canceled a meeting hosting Palestinian human rights activist Leila
Khaled]{.underline}; a month before, Facebook and Twitter censored
information detrimental to Joseph Biden's presidential campaign. The
same two companies intervened and shut down pro-Trump accounts in 2020,
even Donald Trump's own Facebook and Twitter accounts. After the
attempted coup at the US capitol on January 6, 2020, Facebook's recently
instituted oversight board ruled that Trump had created "an environment
where a serious risk of violence was possible." In this light, it seems
likely that he will continue to be banned from the platform. According
to journalist Shoshana Zuboff, however, this is insufficient, given that
the oversight board's decision (whose work is supported by a \$130
million endowment from Facebook) follows years of inaction by CEO Mark
Zuckerberg, who indulged and appeased Trump while entrenching what
Zuboff calls "surveillance capitalism."1 A liberal might think that
shutting up Trump and helping Biden is not bad, as they are actions that
seemingly advance the interests of the Democratic Party. [What is at
stake here, however, is not whether the platforms take a "good" or "bad"
stance on a particular issue; the problem is that they [have immense
unchecked power and]{.mark} can act as they please]{.underline}.
[Platforms are allowed to [secretly extract]{.mark} behavioral [data
from users]{.mark}, whether or not users are aware, transforming the
information into targeted ads, destroying privacy, changing human
experience into data, altering elections, [and reshaping human
civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This structure can be termed [the
"cybernetic episteme]{.mark}," and the new form of control]{.underline},
which goes beyond the previous regime of biopower, can be termed
"neuropower." According to its Greek etymology, an "episteme" is a
system of understanding. In The Order of Things, Michel Foucault uses
the term "épistemè" to mean the nontemporal or a priori knowledge that
grounds what is taken as truth in a given moment. Several epistemes
coexist at a given time, as they constitute parts of various systems of
power and knowledge. [The cybernetic episteme, as defined by the
collective Tiqqun some twenty years ago, describes our relationship to
technology and machines (which are inseparable from the workings of
capitalism).2 The cybernetic episteme is based on the modern tenet of
progress and human-led transcendence achieved through science and
technology.]{.underline} Under neuropower, the sensible gives way to
cognitive pathologies. These pathologies depend on the consumption of
content rather than the sharing of meaning. As Thomas Metzinger
explains, [the internet [has become an integral part of
how]{.mark}]{.underline} [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} model ourselves, as
we use it for external memory storage, as a cognitive prosthesis, and
for [[emotional self-regulation]{.mark}.]{.underline} This has
[radically changed the structure of conscious experience]{.underline},
creating a new form of waking consciousness that resembles "a mixture of
dreaming, dementia, intoxication, and infantilization."3 Other effects
of neuropower are humans' [growing invisibility to each other and a
paroxysmal racism that infiltrates power, technology, culture, language,
and work]{.underline}. For Franco "Bifo" Berardi, [[racism has become a
"virus" that exacerbates fear]{.mark}---above all]{.underline}, [[the
fear of extinction, which seems to have become one of the motors behind
white supremacy in the world]{.underline}]{.mark}.4 Dissociated from our
environment, alienated from each other, we are oblivious to the
challenges that are being posed to humanity by the Capitalocene.

Under lockdown, [[internet-based technology became embedded in everyday
life]{.mark} more than ever before. Zoom and other [platforms became the
matrix of a production model that exacerbates the power of
tech]{.mark}nology [over society]{.mark}]{.underline}. A new lockdown
economy has emerged in this disembodied communication space, where
[[knowledge is subsumed under]{.mark} the rules of [capital
accumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The pandemic has led to extreme
alienation, to the point that privilege is defined as depending on
invisible laborers to sustain forms of life. This means that a new
"virtual working class" has emerged that can take basics like food,
water, and electricity for granted, knowing that they do not have to
risk their bodies to have these comforts. Until 2016, [digital
technology promised access to all human knowledge, unlimited exchange,
self-expression, democratization, participation, opportunities to make
money, the acceleration of bureaucratic processes, and the means for
grassroots and popular power to challenge governments and
corporations.]{.underline} The peak of this alluring cyber-utopia came
around 2010--11, when social media played a crucial role in the Occupy
and Arab Spring movements. But in 2016, when Cambridge Analytica was
revealed to have intervened in the US elections that brought Donald
Trump to power, the public's belief in such technologies to change power
structures began to shift. We witnessed the worldwide rise of right-wing
governments and populist movements supported by wealth. Maurizzio
Ferraris has called this the era of "post-truth," when the
deconstruction of a stable truth became an important political tool.5 In
online public space, [[discourse has been shattered]{.mark}, [truth has
become indiscernible, and relativism has become the norm]{.mark}. The
public sphere---the bastion of established and emerging democracies,
bolstered by mass media---began to shatter]{.underline}. Leaders such as
Benjamin Netanyahu, Donald Trump, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Jair
Bolsonaro, and Narendra Modi have used digital communications to
construct charismatic identities and disseminate populist messages,
[[causing deep social and political polarization]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Politics has profoundly mutated: while minorities and people at [the
margins have found ways to validate their speech by expressing their
perspectives, individualized propaganda has become the order of the day.
[Algorithms feed users the information they search for, resulting
in]{.mark} personalized]{.underline} information bubbles designed to
engage preexisting biases. Much of the [news [media now functions by
monetizing user engagement through]{.mark} this type of
[targeting,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} has led to
new forms [of [intensified racism]{.mark} and other types of
prejudice]{.underline}. Author Andrey Mir has termed this
"postjournalism."6 He explains that, since mass media outlets have lost
publicity revenue, they need to monetize engagement on the internet and
do so by generating anger and hatred, usually directed at some specific
group of people. For many, [the news is the way to access the world, and
[rage has become currency:]{.mark}]{.underline} [[platforms]{.mark}
drive and [monetize anger as a mode of engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[A complex form of authoritarianism is emerging, linked to digital
platforms owned by the powerful CEOs who make up the notorious "Silicon
Six."]{.underline} Under the new authoritarianism, [[populations are no
longer commanded: they are asked to participate]{.underline}]{.mark},
and in [this simulation of involvement, [the "ideology of connection"
replaces the idea of social relations]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[neutralizing democratic demands from users to have control over their
own lives]{.underline}]{.mark}, rights, and data. [In this way, [people
are made passive]{.mark}]{.underline}.7 Cédric Durand explains the
difference between the original conception of the World Wide Web and the
subsequent development of closed platforms. The WWW began as a
decentralized architecture in which a generic transaction protocol
(http) and a uniform identification format (URI/URL) generated a space
of flat content. In this space, human and nonhuman agents could have
access to information without any third-party mediation. In contrast,
closed platforms use application programming interfaces, or APIs, to
mediate interaction, giving way to data loops in which interactions are
more dense. The technical object that sustains this hierarchical
architecture is the API, each of which is owned by a platform. On the
one hand, big platforms, by way of APIs, offer apps that incorporate
basic and indispensable data for users. On the other, platforms have
access to the additional information generated by the API, such as user
activity and buying habits. [[As the ecosystem grows in
complexity]{.mark}, the platform is able to accumulate more and more
data]{.underline}.8 We become more densely connected with each other and
with the platforms every day, as [[our lives get more and more tied to
the cloud]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Our [dependency on platforms provides the ground for
technofeudalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Historically, [[feudalism
was]{.mark} characterized by a [fundamental inequality that
enabled]{.mark} the direct [exploitation of peasants by lords]{.mark}.
[The lord was]{.mark} both [the]{.mark} manager and [master]{.mark} not
only of the process [of production]{.mark}, but of the entire process of
social life. [In today's technofeudalism, platform owners are the
digital lords and users are the serfs]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather than
commodity production, [these platforms are geared towards accumulation
through rent, debt, and the privatization of the basic infrastructure
that sustains our lives]{.underline}. What is at stake is no longer
"true" or "fake" information but the cybernetic episteme upon which our
lives and subjectivities have been built. The cybernetic episteme is
premised upon modernity's enclosure of experience. [[In modern
epistemology]{.mark}, which is the precondition of the cybernetic
episteme, [the self is externalized]{.mark} and experienced at a remove
from the body.]{.underline} [Perception is centered on the brain and
eyes]{.underline} [instead of the whole body, [separating sensation from
reason]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[The self's relationship with the world is
mediated through]{.underline}]{.mark} mirrors[, [camera
lenses]{.underline},]{.mark} the canvas, the microscope, and
mathematical models.9 [[The cybernetic episteme]{.underline}]{.mark},
moreover, [[is]{.mark} [inextricable from
colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which entails
dispossession]{.underline}, dislocation, dissociation, and
appropriation. Ariella Azoulay has called the logic underpinning these
processes "the shutter"; this logic is materialized in photographic
technology that separates humans from objects, self from the world, and
people from their lands. [[The shutter is the principle of
imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark} by which campaigns of plunder have left
people both worldless and objectless. For Azoulay, the logic of the
shutter was invented centuries before photography gave it a
technological apparatus, and it enabled the dispossession of non-Western
peoples in tandem with the accumulation of visual and material wealth in
archives and museums in the West.10 [[The cybernetic episteme is]{.mark}
likewise conceptually [constituted by]{.mark} this [shutter]{.mark},
since [it]{.mark} [relies]{.mark} [on]{.mark} capturing, naming, moving,
and archiving subjects---as does imperialism.]{.underline} In this
regard, [the cybernetic episteme naturalizes the mediation of the self;
it creates not only the condition of detachment from the world, but
allows the appropriation of the cultures of others, as well as the
dissolution of collective being]{.underline}. The shutter is akin to
Heidegger's Gestell or "representation," which goes hand in hand with
Eurocentrism and Anthropocentrism. [The Gestell and the shutter both
imply that the world and experience have become [representation, through
an aesthetic order]{.mark}]{.underline} in which what is produced as
artifice becomes the reality of experience. In a 2017 Facebook promo
video for a new virtual reality technology, [Mark
Zuckerberg]{.underline} and his colleague Rachel Frank tele-transported
themselves to Puerto Rico after a devastating flood. They intended to
showcase the potential of the new technology, but instead [revealed its
inherent violence. The ability to transport oneself to faraway places
"as if" one's body were present gives the illusion that one we can make
a difference in the world through technology]{.underline}.11 Another
example, in a different register of [colonial modernity is that way
Western museums allow visitors to \"transport\" themselves by observing
objects looted from elsewhere]{.underline}, like the Pergamon Museum in
Berlin where museumgoers can roam around the Ishtar Gate, which has been
on display in the museum since 1930. In a section of Ariella Azoulay's
video Undocumented: Unlearning Imperial Plunder (2020), she films actual
visitors to the Pergamon while noting that dislocation is the essence of
(imperial) modernity. The VR museum visitor is at the center of a world,
but they are not really there (an effect similar to the dispositive of
perspective in painting). [For globalized Western culture, the ground
for vision, enlightenment, culture, and even social change is the
dislocation and disappearance of bodies.12]{.underline} [Disembodiment
and dislocation are]{.underline} also fundamental [epistemological
premises of transhumanist Silicon Valley ideology. In this ideology, the
teleology of secular modern individualism culminates in the uploading of
a person's mind to a new biological, artificial, or
biological-artificial body]{.underline}. The utopian goal of expanding
and preserving human consciousness is physically and spiritually
achieved. [Transhumanism is the dream of enhancing the human body
through technology, and ultimately escaping human suffering by
transcending the "errors" of death and aging]{.underline}. Posthumanism
takes things a step further: its goal is to immortalize consciousness by
uploading it to a robotic or synthetic body. [Posthumanism does away
with the biological dimension of the self, fundamentally altering what
it means to be "human."]{.underline} In both trans- and posthumanism,
technology promises to give us the divine attributes of omnipresence,
omnipotence, and omniscience, making humans into "pure consciousness,"
achieving a kind of individual and secular transcendence. In the first
episode of the British TV series Years and Years (2019), Bethany, an
adolescent whose face is hidden behind a 3D emoji mask, announces to her
parents that she is "transhuman." She declares: "[[I don't want to be
flesh. I want to escape]{.mark} this thing [and become digital]{.mark},
I want to live forever as information]{.underline}." Eventually Bethany
becomes a hero with transhuman superpowers: her mechanized eyes and
brain, which are connected to all the data in the world, allow her to
make visible the horrors that the British government have perpetrated in
a refugee camp. This techno-utopian narrative implies a democratic
ideology, insofar as one political goal of democracy is to make visible
the ordeals of oppressed minorities---in this case through virtual
disembodiment. In contrast to this techno-utopian narrative, science
fiction---especially cyberpunk literature--- generally portrays
transhumanism as a nightmarish apocalyptic scenario of social control
and individual subjection. Several episodes of Black Mirror do this, for
example. But what Black Mirror and Years and Years have in common is
that technological advances and the increasing symbiosis between humans
and machines are associated with political, economic, and social
instability. In reality, "mind uploading" has attracted millions of
dollars of investment from the billionaires of Silicon Valley and
beyond. In a mixture of engineering and enlightenment[, [consciousness
is now being hacked through biofeedback techniques, meditation
practices, and microdosing drugs]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many critics have
observed that the utopian ideology of transhumanism underpins the
Valley's culture of "move fast, break things, and make as much money as
possible." [[Technologies aiming to expand human consciousness are
rooted in]{.mark} purely [extractivist, capitalist
values]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this sense, [[cybernetics is]{.mark} a
political project on a planetary scale.]{.underline} As described by
Tiqqun, cybernetics is a gigantic "abstract machine" made up of binary
machines [[deployed by empire]{.mark}, and a form of political
sovereignty [that has merged with the capitalist extractivist
project.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In the pre-cybernetic era---that is to say, [[before the
1940s---machines were intended to emulate humans]{.mark}; their actions
resembled human behavior, but]{.underline} ostensibly [[without intent
or emotions]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is why Donna Haraway describes
pre-cybernetic machines as "haunted."13 [They seemed animated by
ghosts]{.underline}, reminiscent of Walter Benjamin's automaton that was
inhabited by a hunchbacked dwarf. [[Machines were not]{.mark}
self-moving, self-designing, or [autonomous]{.mark}. They could not
achieve human dreams, only mock them]{.underline}. In turn, [[humans
related to machines by using or acting upon them]{.mark}: switching them
on or off]{.underline}, using them as tools to achieve an end. [[Today,
the relationship between human and machine is based on internal]{.mark},
mutual [communication in a feedback loop]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Early
machines were led; today, machines lead us]{.mark}.]{.underline}14 This
does not mean that machines have simply become humanized through the
proliferation of androids. Rather, [[humans have surrendered
consciousness to AI, becoming]{.mark} [obedient and
predictable]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In the twenty-first century,
[[machines have blurred the distinction between the artificial and
human]{.mark} mind]{.underline}, not only because machines can imitate
human functions, but because [[humans have become]{.mark} increasingly
[passive]{.mark}, since we are now subject to neuropower]{.underline}.
Within the cybernetic episteme, [it is no longer enough to talk about a
"control society"; we must talk instead about a composite of interlinked
forms of oppression (exploitation, alienation, and
domination]{.underline}), in tandem with extreme securitarianism.
Another way to see the cybernetic episteme is as the reconceptualization
of social worlds into information-processing systems. [[Practices of
computation]{.mark} are used to produce new organizational and
infrastructural apparatuses, which in turn [create value]{.mark} and
profit [by exploiting]{.mark} [and disposing of human
life.]{.mark}]{.underline} Social worlds are subsumed into technologies
through techniques such as statistical forecasting and data modeling.
The cybernetic episteme stems from a world brought into being by
Europeans; this world began with the discovery of the "new world" and
the creation of empires and colonies (which coincided with the
scientific revolution). In this sense, [the cybernetic episteme is
inseparable from the Western civilizing project for the whole
world]{.underline}, which connected disparate places through
technologies like the telegraph and steam shipping, often powered by the
extraction of fossil fuels like coal. [This project has culminated in
globalization as the deregulation and financialization of world
economies.15 The Western civilization project, based on Enlightenment
values including equality, peaceful public life, access to modern
science, the rule of law, democracy, and technological progress,
involved the creation of infrastructure to unify nations and the
world.]{.underline}16 [We can call this infrastructure [the
"technosphere]{.mark}.]{.underline}" The technosphere comprises not only
digital technology but all machines, factories, computers, cars,
buildings, railways, and mobility infrastructure, as well as systems of
food production, resource extraction, and energy distribution. Today,
the infrastructure of the world---[the technosphere---[is shaped
by]{.mark} information, which means that the world we inhabit is
designed [by data]{.mark}]{.underline}.17 The technosphere is a
supplement humans have created to help overcome the limits of "human
nature" insofar as humans cannot live independently from structures
geared towards sustaining life[. [The technosphere has promised to
enable us to increase production and reproduction]{.mark} [with less
human effort]{.mark}. Moreover, [the
technosphere](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/122/430488/authoritarianism-and-the-cybernetic-episteme-or-the-progressive-disappearance-of-everything-on-earth/)
is also regarded as the main tool humans have to fight decay, entropy,
and death]{.underline}, since it comprises all the structures humans
have built to keep themselves alive on the planet. The total mass of the
technosphere amounts to fifty kilos for every square meter of earth's
surface---a total of thirty trillion tons, which coexists with the
diminishing hydrosphere (water, the frozen polar regions) and the
biosphere (all of earth's living organisms).18 [[The ultimate price of
the technosphere is global warming and environmental
devastation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Like humans, the [technosphere needs
external energy input, [which is not sustainable]{.mark} as long as it
comes from fossil fuels that will eventually be depleted. From this
standpoint, the cybernetic episteme represents the gradual merging of
human activity into the activity of what we have built and surrounded
ourselves with]{.underline}. Much of this built environment is
invisible.19 Infrastructure and data are partially occult because we are
alienated from them, even as we are produced and managed by them. The
invisible infrastructure that sustains our lives is what matters
politically right now. [And insofar as the technosphere is cybernetic,
it is inextricable from capitalism and politics.]{.underline}

I am not suggesting that Crutzen and others are part of a vast
conspiracy; rather, I want to outline how [climate change, species loss,
slavery, the elimination of native peoples, and the globalization of
extractive capitalism are **all part of the same global
ordering**]{.underline}. That is, [all of these crises are
geopolitical]{.underline}. The particular geopolitical arrangement of
what others have called the longue durée, and what I am calling [[the
Eurocene, is]{.mark} geologically significant but is not universally
part of "human activity]{.underline}" despite the false syllogism at the
heart of popular ecological thinking that a global threat to humanity
must be shared in cause and crisis by all of humanity.11 Departing from
Sloterdijk, I am hesitant to so easily locate modernity or explication
as the root or cause of the global catastrophe. No single strategy, war,
act of colonization, technological breakthrough, or worldview fully
explains the apocalypse before us. However, there is something like what
Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari call a refrain that holds the vast
assemblage together, [[a geopolitical melody hummed along with the
**global expansion of**]{.mark} **a form of life characterized by
[homogenization]{.mark} [rather than
diversification]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Accordingly, if we are to make
some sense of such a vast world that is, even for Crutzen and Birks,
"quite complex and difficult to model," I think we must consider
[[the]{.mark} particular [refrain of geopolitics]{.mark} that
[is]{.mark} capable of, by scientific as well as more humbly embodied
standards, **[destroying worlds along with the
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}.12 [[To eschew geopolitics]{.mark} simply
[because]{.mark}, as a refrain, [it is too big]{.mark}, too grand, or
too universal [would]{.mark} [ignore the conditions of possibility for
nuclear weapons, power politics, and]{.mark} carbon-based
[globalization]{.mark}, and would greatly impoverish the explanatory
capability of even the best climate models]{.underline}. So maybe it is
not so strange that Crutzen and others' attention to [the nuclear threat
of great powers has all but disappeared despite the fact that Russia and
the United States still possess thousands of nuclear weapons, and as of
late have been all too vocal about using them]{.underline}. Instead[,
[the Anthropocene]{.mark}]{.underline}, as envisioned by Crutzen as a
universal concern, [[requires]{.mark} with it [a depoliticization of the
causes of that concern]{.mark}.]{.underline} Therefore, Crutzen's
fascination with nuclear winter is geopolitical not because it is about
nuclear weapons---although that does not hurt. Rather, Crutzen's
[attention to nuclear winter is geopolitical because it is an image of
the Earth system as a system with particular beneficiaries animating
that interest.]{.underline} Sloterdijk's diagnosis of what I am terming
[[the Eurocene]{.mark},]{.underline} or the space of what he calls
European "earth-users," **[[is present in the very cybernetic
understanding of the planet as a spatial and substantive
whole]{.underline}]{.mark}**.13 [In the cases of both nuclear winter and
climate change, the atmosphere is a model, or more accurately, the last
model. **[The whole Earth becomes a single integer in a larger set of
planet systems rather than a set of habitats, zones, or
locales.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[**The Earth is merely another system
isomorphic as a unit of analysis**]{.mark} with Mars or the exoplanet
trappist]{.underline}-1f. The shift in scale from place to the planetary
is much more than a pulling back from the ground upward. [The
[integrated Earth as the representation of a system]{.mark} and as an
actual material system [is aided by]{.mark} a process of integration,
proceeded by [a few hundred years of]{.mark}]{.underline} Sloterdijk's
conception of [[explication]{.mark} where each part of each environment
is disaggregated, described, and then reassembled to explain the
whole.]{.underline} The [process of [integration is not merely]{.mark} a
[metaphoric or metaphysical]{.mark} geopolitics. It is the condition of
possibility to understand the planetary as being political, as well as
the condition of possibility for its charting as an economic and
military cartography.]{.underline} Unlike the weltanschauung of
Heidegger's world image, [[the planetary "user space" requires **five
hundred years of conquest**, fossil fuel extraction and exploitation,
settlement]{.mark}, hundreds of expert fields from geography to
chemistry to ecology, and the normative consolidation of cosmopolitanism
as a right to the freedom of movement at least for those capable of the
feat]{.underline}.14 The worldview or world image alone is a necessary
but insufficient cause. [The [practices that]{.mark} habituated,
[expanded]{.mark}, and intensified [that worldview are]{.mark} what is
[critical to its emergence]{.mark}. In this sense, [the
Anthropocene]{.mark},]{.underline} like Crutzen's award-winning models
of climate change and nuclear winter, [[is]{.mark} much more than an
explanatory model]{.underline}. [These models are [the outcome of five
centuries of]{.mark} integration and [homogenization]{.mark} [such that
the infrastructure capable of making the Earth as a system knowable
could be built]{.mark}, **[and the circulation of knowledge and data
could be amassed to even make the diagnosis of a geological epoch in the
first place]{.mark}**]{.underline}.15 Properly accounting for the
origins of our ecological crisis is vital. [No political project
oriented toward the many possible futures stretching out before us can
consider the questions of ecology and justice on a global, much less
geological, scale unless we first take on the unfortunate historical
generality of the Anthropocene]{.underline}. [[The continuing project of
Europeanization]{.mark}, now [led by U.S. imperial
power]{.mark}]{.underline} (although perhaps not for much longer), [[is
central to how the planet got to this point]{.mark}. [Understanding this
is essential for how]{.mark} any "[we]{.mark}" worthy of the plurality
of the planet can [invent something less nasty]{.mark} and brutish [than
what currently counts as global order]{.mark}. [A consideration of the
Eurocene]{.mark}, a geological history and name that foregrounds the
geopolitical confrontation that stands in the way of any such future,
[is required in order to take the scale of our predicament seriously,
while also confronting the power politics that made that scale
possible.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Cybernetics reshapes our working memory by the rearranging of contents---facilitates a new global order of cybernetic fascism

[[Human communication is at the center of the cybernetic global
order]{.mark}. The neural system of globalized networked society is
digital communication.]{.underline} In a 1975 film called Comment ça
va?, Anne-Marie Miéville and Jean-Luc Godard discuss the "illness" of
information. They begin with an image of the Carnation Revolution in
Portugal, published in the leftist newspaper Libération. At the time,
photojournalistic images had begun to proliferate as a form of
information, and Godard and Miéville critique Libération (the most
left-wing newspaper in Europe in those days) for failing to include the
reader in the creation and dissemination of information. [They ask: "How
is it that things enter and exit the machine?"]{.underline} (Comment ça
va de l'entrée à la sortie de la machine?). [This question is about how
ideas, words, discourses, human interaction, and images become
information and then reach readers and viewers. In Comment ça va?, mass
media represents an illness that has killed communication and
language]{.underline}. Last year, Godard updated his critique of the
media in an interview posted to Instagram. He stated: "Plato's cave has
been fixed on paper/screen." [For Godard, [the consequence of the
becoming-information]{.mark} of communication and language is the loss
of ambiguity in communication. [Digital technology has infiltrated every
aspect of existence,]{.mark} and [the margin of error between the
transmission and the reception of a message has been eliminated
by]{.mark} mediatization and [digitization]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
Godard, [digital communication denies the force of the image or the word
because it eliminates redundancy, misunderstanding, the possibility of
reading between the lines, and the possibility of alterity]{.underline}.
In a more recent film of his---Adieu au language from 2014---[Godard
suggests that [digital media have destroyed face-to-face
communication]{.mark}]{.underline}. He asks: [[What kind of self could
emerge]{.mark} in a time when objects and bodies are disfigurable and
refigurable [through virtual manipulation]{.mark}]{.underline}?20 Godard
posits that [[the origins of today's totalitarianism can be
traced]{.mark} [to the]{.mark} interruption of interior experience by
the [spectacle]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the film, Godard features a
lengthy quote from Philippe Sollers explaining that the spectacle "cuts
off" the subject from its interior life---a process that is,
paradoxically, highly seductive.21 Furthermore, for Godard [[digital
communication creates]{.mark} a new form of [isolated solitude where
people lack ties to others]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this light,
[[technology has not become an extension of man]{.mark},]{.underline} as
Marshall McLuhan predicted, [[but has instead attained autonomy from
man]{.mark}, since [digital media can communicate amongst themselves
without human mediation]{.mark}]{.underline}. For Godard, this means
that the "face-to-face" encounter---a basic form of human relation that
is the foundation of ethics---is no longer possible. Sherry Turkle, a
clinical psychologist and sociologist, comes to similar conclusions:
[daily conversations no longer involve eye contact, and face-to-face
discussion has been replaced by words on a screen]{.underline}.22
According to Turkle, texts, tweets, Facebook posts, Instagram messages,
and Snapchats split our attention and diminish our capacity for empathy.
[They have created new codes of etiquette]{.underline}; no longer do we
feel restrained from reaching for our phones in the presence of other
people[. [This new etiquette entrenches a culture]{.mark} of
individualism and isolation from each other.]{.underline} [This
isolation cultivates the [perfect ground for
fascism]{.mark}]{.underline}. The digitization of communication not only
has political and communal consequences. It also affects the
neuroplastic potential of the living brain. [[The cybernetic episteme
reshapes our working memory by rearranging its
contents]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Warren Neidich writes, [the new focus
of power is]{.underline} not only the false reproduction of the past
(the manipulation of the archive), but [the manipulation of our working
memory]{.underline}---the type of memory that influences our
decision-making. [Authoritarian neuropower wants nothing less than to
shape our future memory,]{.underline} argues Neidich.23 If the nervous
system of cybernetics is digital communication, at [[the center of
digital communication is desire]{.underline}]{.mark}. Mark Fisher
devoted his last lectures at Goldsmiths in 2017 to this subject. During
one lecture, he played for his students a famous Apple TV commercial
from 1984, directed by Ridley Scott and originally broadcast during the
Superbowl. In an overt reference to George Orwell's novel 1984, the
commercial depicts a dreary, repressive control society. This society is
seemingly liberated when a buxom blonde woman tosses a sledgehammer at a
large screen broadcasting the image of an authoritarian figure, causing
the screen to explode. The commercial ends with these lines crawling
across the screen: "On January 24, Apple Computer will introduce
Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984." Fisher observes
that the video counterposes top-down bureaucratic control to upstart
entrepreneurialism. The dreary control society depicted in the
commercial is an allusion to not only the Soviet Union, but also IBM,
the dominant computer maker at the time. [Apple posits itself as the
dynamic, colorful new company that will liberate society from dreary
IBM]{.underline}, ushering in a new, more vibrant world order. [[This
new]{.mark} [world order]{.mark} will fulfill our (capitalist) desires
in a way that the communist world cannot. As Fisher suggests, we now
live in that world of libidinal capitalism]{.underline}.24 Elsewhere
Fisher writes that what drives the circulation of information is the
user's desire to make one more connection, to leave one more reply, to
keep on clicking. [Capitalism [persists because cyberspace is already
under our skin]{.mark}]{.underline}, writes Fisher; to retreat from it
would be like trying to retreat into some nonexistent precapitalist
imaginary. In his view, we believe we have as [much a chance of escaping
capitalism as we do of crawling back inside our mother's
womb]{.underline}.

### Alt -- Shared Reality

#### We need to defend facts about a shared reality and develop mutually shared relationships exclusive from the cybernetic episteme

By means of the cybernetic episteme, [[Silicon Valley has shaped the
world we all live in]{.underline}]{.mark}. As [[we
are]{.underline}]{.mark} poisoned equally by microplastics and fake
news, [[losing our grasp of a shared reality]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
"Silicon Six"---as Sacha Baron Cohen called the titans of Silicon Valley
in a 2019 speech---[propagate [algorithm-fueled fear]{.mark},
propaganda, lies, and hate in the name of profit]{.underline}. As Baron
Cohen pointed out, the major online platforms largely avoid the kind of
regulation and accountability that other [[media companies are subject
to.]{.mark} "This is [ideological
imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}" he said. "Six unelected
individuals in Silicon Valley impos\[e\] their vision on the rest of the
world, unaccountable to any government, and acting as if they are above
the law."26 He called digital platforms the greatest propaganda machine
in history. Democratic institutions have failed to reign in the
information chaos and the destruction of the public sphere. As Shoshana
Zuboff argues, [we inhabit a communications sphere that is no longer a
public sphere]{.underline}.[[27 She describes this]{.mark} situation [as
an "epistemic coup]{.mark}"]{.underline} that has taken place [[in four
stages:]{.underline}]{.mark} [[First,]{.mark} by way of [companies
gathering personal data about us]{.mark} and [then claiming it
as]{.mark} [their own private property]{.mark}. [Second, through data
inequality,]{.mark} which means that companies know more than we do.
[Third, through the epistemic chaos created by algorithms. And
fourth]{.mark}, [through the]{.mark} institutionalization of this new
episteme and the [erosion of democratic
governance]{.mark}.]{.underline}28 Baron Cohen observes that people can
take a stand against platforms by recognizing our power to boycott them.
(One example is the mass defection from WhatsApp to Telegram when the
former announced that would share its user data with Facebook.) But
[[we]{.mark} also [need to defend the existence of facts and a shared
reality]{.mark}, [understanding the world]{.mark} not as something we
see but as something we inhabit---treating life not as something we
have, but [as something we live.]{.mark} Anti-platform
strategies]{.underline} might be accused of Luddism, but they are not
necessarily [opposed to technology---only to certain uses of
technology]{.underline}. It is also crucial that we regard the
cybernetic episteme as inextricable from a broader malaise: [humanity's
relationship to life and the planet is a toxic one.]{.underline} [The
very technologies that supposedly enable us to read, think, flourish,
and desire are destroying the world we inhabit]{.underline}.29 [[People
continue to yearn for commonality]{.underline}]{.mark}, mutuality, [[and
something to share. But the culture we]{.mark} currently [share
is]{.mark} largely [mediated by repressive, profit-driven digital
platforms]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is why [[we need to flee from the
invasion of images, to distinguish between image and
reality]{.underline}]{.mark}, and to affirm the opacity of the world and
the ambiguity of language. We need to resist platform monopoly through
presence, embodiment, immediacy, and human memory. [[We need to find
ways to create life as opposed to turning it into data,]{.mark} combine
emotional and intellectual knowledge, [and regard visceral gut feelings
as a form of human consciousness]{.mark}]{.underline}. We need [[to
learn to exist in symbiosis with others and with the
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}, not dislocated, uprooted, and
detached.

"They wanted an adventure, and to live it out with you. In the end all
that's all that can be said. They believed resolutely that the future
would be modern: different, impassioning, and definitely difficult.
Peopled by cyborgs and bare handed entrepreneurs, frenzied
stock-marketeers and turbine-men. And for those that are willing to see
it, the present is already like that. They think the future will be
human, feminine even --- and plural; so that everyone can really live
it, so that everyone participates in it. They are the Enlightenment men
we've lost, infantrymen of progress, the inhabitants of the 21st
century. They fight against ignorance, injustice, poverty, and suffering
of all kinds. They go where it's happening, where things are going on.
They don't want to miss out on a thing. They're humble and courageous,
at the service of interests that are far beyond them, guided by a higher
principle. They can pose problems, and they can find solutions. They'll
have us traversing the most perilous of frontiers, they'll reach out a
hand to pull us up onto the shore of the future. They're History
marching forth, at least what's left of it, because the hardest part is
over. They're the saints and the prophets, true socialists. They've
known for a long while that May 1968 wasn't a revolution. The true
revolution is the one they're making. Now it's just a matter of
organization and transparency, intelligence and cooperation. A vast
program! Then\..." Excuse me? What? What'd you say? What program? The
worst nightmares, you know, are often the metamorphoses of a fable,
fables [PEOPLE tell their kids to put them to sleep and perfect their
moral education.]{.underline} The [[new conquerors]{.mark}, who we'll
call the cyberneticians, do not comprise an organized party --- which
would have made our work here a lot easier --- but rather a [diffuse
constellation of agents]{.mark}, all driven, [possessed, and
blinded]{.mark} by the same fable]{.underline}. [T[hese are the
murderers of Time, the crusaders of Sameness, the lovers of
fatality]{.mark}]{.underline}. These are the sectarians of order, the
reason-addicts, the go-between people. The Great Legends may indeed be
dead, as the post-modern vulgate often claims, but domination is still
comprised of master-fictions. Such was the case of the Fable of the Bees
published by Bernard de Mandeville in the first years of the 18th
century, [[which contributed]{.mark} so much [to the founding of
political economy and]{.mark} to [justifying the advances made by
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Prosperity, the social order, and
politics no longer depended on the catholic virtues of sacrifice but on
the pursuit by each individual of his own interests: it declared the
"private vices" to be guarantees of the "common good." Mandeville, the
"Devil-Man" as PEOPLE called him at the time, thus founded the liberal
hypothesis, as opposed to the religious spirit of his times, a
hypothesis which would later have a great influence on Adam Smith.
Though it is regularly re-invoked, in a renovated form given it by
liberalism, this fable is obsolete today. [For critical minds, it
follows that [it's not worth it]{.mark} anymore [to critique
liberalism]{.mark}. [A new model has taken its place, the]{.mark} very
[one that hides]{.mark} [behind]{.mark} the names "internet," "[new
information and communications technology]{.mark}," the "new economy,"
or genetic engineering]{.underline}. [[Liberalism is now no longer
anything but]{.mark} a residual justification, [an alibi for]{.mark} the
everyday crimes committed by [cybernetics]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Rationalist critics of the "economic creed" or of the "neo-technological
utopia," anthropologist critics of utilitarianism in social sciences and
the hegemony of commodity exchange, marxist critics of the "cognitive
capitalism" that oppose to it the "communism of the masses," political
critics of a communications utopia that resuscitates the worst phantasms
of exclusion, critics of the critiques of the "new spirit of
capitalism," or critics of the "prison State" and surveillance hiding
behind neo-liberalism --- [[critical minds hardly]{.mark} appear to be
very inclined to [take into account]{.mark} [the emergence of
cybernetics]{.mark} as a new technology of government, which federates
and associates both discipline and bio-politics, police and
advertising]{.underline}, its ancestors in the exercise of domination,
all too ineffective today. That is to say, [[cybernetics]{.underline}
[is not,]{.underline}]{.mark} as we are supposed to believe, [[a
separate sphere of the production]{.mark} [of information and
communication]{.mark}, a virtual space superimposed on the real world.
No, [it is]{.mark}, rather, [an autonomous world of apparatuses]{.mark}
so [blended with the capitalist project]{.mark} that it has become a
political project, a gigantic "abstract machine]{.underline}" made of
binary machines [[run by the Empire]{.underline}]{.mark}, [a new form of
political sovereignty, [which must be called an abstract machine that
has made itself into a global war machine]{.mark}.]{.underline} Deleuze
and Guattari link this rupture to a new kind of appropriation of war
machines by Nation-States: "Automation, and then the automation of the
war machine, only came truly into effect after the Second World War. The
war machine, considering the new antagonisms running through it, no
longer had War as its exclusive object, but rather it began to take
charge of and make Peace, policy, and world order into its object; in
short: such is its goal. [Thus we see the inversion of Clausewitz's
formula: politics becomes the continuation of war, and peace will
releas]{.underline}e, technologically, the unlimited material process of
total war. [[War ceases to be the materialization of the war machine,
and rather it is the war machine that itself becomes war itself
materialized]{.mark}."]{.underline} That's why it's not worth it anymore
to critique the cybernetic hypothesis either: [it has to be fought and
defeated]{.underline}. It's just a matter of time.

#### The Cybernetic society facilitates violent totalitarianism

[[The Cybernetic Hypothesis]{.underline}]{.mark} is thus a political
hypothesis, a new fable that after the second world war has definitively
supplanted the liberal hypothesis. Contrary to the latter, it [[proposes
to conceive biological]{.mark}, physical, [and social behaviors as
something]{.mark} integrally programmed and
[re-programmable]{.mark}]{.underline}. More precisely, it conceives of
each individual behavior as something "piloted," in the last analysis,
by the need for the survival of a "system" that makes it possible, and
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} it must contribute to. It is a way of
thinking about balance, born in a crisis context. Whereas 1914
sanctioned the decomposition of the anthropological conditions for the
verification of the liberal hypothesis --- the emergence of Bloom and
the bankruptcy, plain to see in flesh and bone in the trenches, of the
idea of the individual and all metaphysics of the subject --- and 1917
sanctioned its historical contestation by the Bolshevik "revolution,"
[1940 on the other hand marked the extinction of the idea of "society,"
so obviously [brought about by totalitarian
self-destruction]{.mark}.]{.underline} [As the limit-experiences of
political modernity, Bloom and totalitarianism thus have been the most
solid refutations of the liberal hypothesis]{.underline}. [[What
Foucault would later call]{.mark} (in a playful tone) "[the death of
Mankind,]{.mark}" is none other than the devastation brought about by
these two kinds of skepticism, the one directed at individuals, and the
other at society]{.underline}, and brought about by the Thirty Years'
War which had so effected the course of Europe and the world in the
first half of the last century. The problem posed by the Zeitgeist of
those years was once again how to "defend society" against the forces
driving it towards decomposition, how to restore the social totality in
spite of a general crisis of presence afflicting it in its every atom.
[[The cybernetic hypothesis]{.mark} [corresponds]{.mark}, consequently,
[to]{.mark} a desire for order and certitude, both in the natural and
social sciences. The most effective arrangement of a constellation of
reactions animated by [an active desire for]{.mark}
totality]{.underline} --- [and not just by a nostalgia for it, as it was
with the various variants of romanticism --- the cybernetic hypothesis
is a relative of not only the [totalitarian ideologies]{.mark}, but also
of all the Holisms, mysticisms, and solidarities, like those of
Durkheim, the functionalists, or the Marxists; it merely takes over from
them]{.underline}. As an ethical position, the cybernetic hypothesis is
the complement, however strictly opposed to it, of the humanist pathos
that has been back in vogue since the 1940s and which is nothing more
than an attempt to act as if "Man" could still think itself intact after
Auschwitz, an attempt to restore the classical metaphysics on the
subject in spite of totalitarianism. But whereas the cybernetic
hypothesis includes the liberal hypothesis at the same time as it
transcends it, humanism's aim is to extend the liberal hypothesis to the
ever more numerous situations that resist it: It's the "bad faith" of
someone like Sartre, to turn one of the author's most inoperative
categories against him. The ambiguity that constitutes modernity, seen
superficially either as a disciplinary process or as a liberal process,
or as the realization of totalitarianism or as the advent of liberalism,
is contained and suppressed in, with and [by [the new governance
mentality emerging now]{.mark}, inspired by the cybernetic hypothesis.
This is but [the life-sized experimentation protocol of the Empire in
formation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its realization and extension, with the
devastating truth-effects it produces, is already corroding all the
social institutions and social relations founded by liberalism, and
transforming both the nature of capitalism and the possibilities of its
contestation. [The cybernetic gesture affirms itself in the negation of
everything that escapes regulation, all the escape routes that existence
might have in the interstices of the norms and apparatuse]{.underline}s,
all the behavioral fluctuations that do not follow, in fine, from
natural laws. Insofar as it has come to produce its own truths, [[the
cybernetic hypothesis]{.mark} i[s]{.mark} today [the most consequential
anti-humanism]{.mark}, which pushes [to maintain]{.mark} the general
[order]{.mark} of things, [all the while bragging that it has
transcended the human.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Cybernetics relies on a self-validation process of information extraction---the only way out is through disruption by physical human discourse

Like any discourse, [[the cybernetic hypothesis could only check to
verify itself by associating the beings or ideas that reinforce it, by
testing itself through contact with them]{.mark}, and folding the world
into its laws [in a continuous self-validation
process]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It's now an ensemble of devices aspiring
to take control over all of existence and what
exists]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Greek word *kubernèsis* means "the act
of piloting a vessel," and in the figurative sense, the "act of
directing, governing." In his 1981--1982 classes, Foucault insisted on
working out the meaning of this category of "piloting" in the Greek and
Roman world, suggesting that it could have a more contemporary scope to
it: ["the idea of piloting as an art, as a theoretical and practical
technology necessary for existence, is an idea that I think is rather
important and may eventually merit a closer analysis]{.underline}; one
can see at least three types of [[technology regularly attached to this
'piloting' idea: first]{.mark} of all [medicine; second of all,
political government; third]{.mark} of all self-direction and
[self-government]{.mark}. These three activities (healing, directing
others, and governing oneself) are quite regularly attached to this
image of piloting]{.underline} in Greek, Hellenic and Roman literature.
And I think that this 'piloting' image also paints a good picture of a
kind of knowledge and practice that the Greeks and Romans had a certain
affinity for, for which they attempted to establish a *tekhnè* (an art,
a planned system of practices connected to general principles, notions,
and concepts): [the Prince, insofar as he must govern others, govern
himself, heal the ills of the city, the ills of the citizens, and his
own ills; he who governs himself as if he were governing a city, by
healing his own ills; the doctor who must give his advice not only about
the ills of the body but about the ills of individuals'
souls]{.underline}. And so you see you have here a whole pack of ideas
in the minds of the Greeks and Romans that have to do I think with one
and the same kind of knowledge, the same type of activity, the same type
of conjectural understanding. And I think that one could dig up the
whole history of that metaphor practically all the way up to the 16^th^
century, when a whole new art of governing, centered around Reasons of
State, would split apart --- in a radical way --- [self
government/medicine/government of others --- not without this image of
'piloting,' *as you well know*, remaining linked to this activity, that
activity which we call the activity of government]{.underline}." What
Foucault's listeners are here supposed to *know well* and which he
refrains from pointing out, [is that at the end of the 20^th^ century,
[the image of piloting]{.mark}, that is, management[, became the
cardinal metaphor for describing]{.mark} not only politics but also all
[human activity. Cybernetics had become the project of unlimited
rationalization]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 1953, when he published *The
Nerves of Government* in the middle of the development of the cybernetic
hypothesis in the natural sciences, Karl Deutsch, an American university
social sciences academic, took the political possibilities of
cybernetics seriously. [[He recommended]{.mark} abandoning the old
concept that power was sovereign, which had too long been the essence of
politics. [To govern]{.mark} would become a rational coordination of the
[flows of information]{.mark} and decisions [that circulate through the
social body]{.mark}.]{.underline} Three conditions would need to be met,
he said: an ensemble of *capturers* would have to be installed so that
no information originating from the "subjects" would be lost;
*information handling* by correlation and association; and a *proximity*
to every living community. [The cybernetic modernization of power and
the expired forms of social authority thus can be seen as the visible
production of what Adam Smith called the "invisible hand]{.underline},"
which until then had served as the mystical keystone of liberal
experimentation. [[The communications system would be the nerve system
of societies]{.mark}, the source and [destination of all
power]{.mark}]{.underline}. *The cybernetic hypothesis thus expresses no
more or less than the politics of the "end of politics."* [It represents
at the same time both a paradigm and a technique of
government]{.underline}. Its study shows that [the]{.underline} [[police
is]{.mark} not just an organ of power, but also [a way of
thinking]{.mark}. Cybernetics is the police-like thinking [of the
Empire]{.mark}, entirely [animated by an *offensive concept of
politics*]{.mark}]{.underline}, both in an historical and metaphysical
sense. It is now completing its integration of the techniques of
individuation --- or separation --- and totalization that had been
developing separately: normalization, "anatomo-politics," and
regulation, "bio-politics," as Foucault calls it. I call his "techniques
of separation" the *police of qualities*. And, following Lukács, [I call
his "techniques of totalization" the *social production of society*.
With cybernetics, the production of singular subjectivities and the
production of collective totalities work together like gears to
replicate History in the form of a *feigned movement* of
evolution]{.underline}. It acts out the fantasy of a Same that always
manages to integrate the Other; as one cybernetician puts it, "[all real
integration is based on a prior differentiation]{.underline}." In this
regard, doubtless no one could put it better than the "automaton"
Abraham Moles, [cybernetics' most zealous French ideologue, who here
expresses this unparalleled murder impulse that drives
cybernetics]{.underline}: "We envision that one global society, one
State, could be managed in such a way that they could be protected
against all the accidents of the future: such that eternity changes them
into themselves. *This is the ideal of a stable society, expressed by
objectively controllable social mechanisms.*" [[Cybernetics is war
against all that lives and all that is lasting]{.mark}. By studying the
formation of the cybernetic hypothesis, I hereby propose *a genealogy of
imperial governance[. ]{.mark}*[I]{.mark} then [counterpose]{.mark}
other [wisdom for the fight, which it erases daily, and by which it will
be defeated]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### AT Cyber Regs

#### Societal notions of cybernetics have been built around the regulation of subjects and military conquest.

Even if the origins of the Internet device are today well known, it is
not uncalled for to highlight once again their *political meaning*.
[[The Internet is a *war machine* invented to be like the highway
system, which was]{.mark} also [designed by the American Army as a
decentralized]{.mark} [internal mobilization tool]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[The American military wanted a device which would preserve the command
structure in case of a nuclear attack]{.underline}]{.mark}. The response
would consist in an electronic network capable of automatically retaking
control over information itself if nearly the whole of the
communications links were destroyed, [thus permitting the surviving
authorities to remain in communication with one another and make
decisions. With such a device, [military authority could be maintained
in the face of the worst catastrophes]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
Internet is thus the result of a *nomadic transformation of military
strategy*]{.underline}. With that kind of a plan at its roots, one might
doubt the supposedly anti-authoritarian characteristics of this device.
As is the Internet, which derives from it, [[cybernetics is an *art of
war*, the objective of which is to save the head of the social body in
case of catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}. What stands out historically
and politically during the period between the great wars, and which the
cybernetic hypothesis was a response to, [was the metaphysical problem
of creating order out of disorder. The whole of the great scientific
edifice, in terms of what it had to do with the determinist concepts of
Newton's mechanical physics, fell apart in the first half of the
century]{.underline}. The sciences, at that time, were like plots of
territory torn between the neo-positivist restoration and the
probabilist revolution, and slowly inching its way towards a historical
compromise so that the law could be re-established after the chaos, the
certain re-established after the probable. [Cybernetics passed through
this whole movement]{.underline} --- which began in Vienna at the turn
of the century, and was transported to England and the United States in
the 1930s and 1940s, and constructed a [*Second Empire of Reason* where
the idea of the Subject, up to that time considered indispensable, was
absent.]{.underline} As a kind of knowledge, it brought together an
ensemble of heterogeneous discourses all dealing with th e *practical
problems of mastering uncertainty*[. Discourses fundamentally
expressing, in the various domains of their application, the desire for
a restoration of one order, and furthermore the maintenance thereof.
Underlying [the founding of Cybernetics was a context of total
war]{.mark}]{.underline}. It would be in vain to look for some malicious
purpose or the traces of a plot: one simply finds a handful of ordinary
men mobilized by America during the Second world war. Norbert Wiener, an
American savant of Russian origin, was charged with developing, with the
aid of a few colleagues, [[*a machine for predicting and monitoring* the
positions]{.mark} of enemy planes so as [to more effectively destroy
them]{.mark}.]{.underline} It was at the time only possible at the time
to predict with certitude certain correlations between certain airplane
positions and certain airplane behaviors/movements. [The elaboration of
the "Predictor," the prediction machine ordered from Wiener, thus
required a specific method of airplane position handling and a
comprehension of how the weapon interacts with its target. *[The whole
history of cybernetics has aimed to]{.mark} do away with the
impossibility of [determining]{.mark} at the same time [the position and
behavior of bodies]{.mark}*]{.underline}*[.]{.mark}* Wiener's innovation
was to *express the problem of uncertainty as an information problem,*
within a temporal series where certain data is already known, and others
not, and to *consider the object and the subject of knowledge as a
whole*, as a "system." [The solution consisted in constantly introducing
into the play of the initial data the *gap* seen between the desired
behavior and the effective behavior, so that they coincide when the gap
closes, [like the mechanism of a thermostat]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
discovery goes considerably beyond the frontiers of the experimental
sciences: [[controlling a system would]{.mark} in the end [require a
circulation of information]{.mark} to be instituted, [called
feed-back]{.mark}]{.underline}, or retro-action. The wide implications
of these results for the natural and social sciences was exposed in 1948
in Paris in a work presented under the foreboding name of
[*Cybernetics*, which for Wiener meant the doctrine [of "control and
communication between animal and machine]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}"
Cybernetics thus emerged as a simple, inoffensive theory of information,
a theory for handling information with no precise origin, always
potentially present in the environment around any situation. [It claims
that *the control of a system is obtained by establishing an optimum
degree of communication between the parties to it*. This objective calls
above all for the continuous extortion of information --- a process of
the *separation* of beings from their qualities, of the production of
differences]{.underline}. In other words, as it were, mastery of a
uncertainty would arise from the proper *representation and
memorization* of the past. The spectacular image, binary mathematical
encoding --- invented by Claude Shannon in *Mathematical Theory of
Communication* in the very same year that the cybernetic hypothesis was
first expressed --- on the one hand they've invented memory machines
that do not alter information, and put incredible effort into
miniaturizing them (this is the determinant strategy behind today's
nanotechnology) and on the other they conspire to create such conditions
on the collective level. [Thus put into form, information would then be
directed towards the world of beings, connecting them to one another in
the same way as commodity circulation guarantees they will be put into
equivalence]{.underline}. Retro-action, key to the system's regulation,
now calls for *communication* in the strict sense. [[Cybernetics is the
project of recreating the world within an infinite feedback loop]{.mark}
involving these two moments: [representation separating, communication
connecting, the first bringing death, the second mimicking
life]{.mark}.]{.underline}
