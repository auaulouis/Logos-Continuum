# AT IR Kritiks -- Analytic Eclecticism

#### Perm: Do Both

#### The permutation is a form of analytic eclecticism -- this is the best method for understanding and advancing IR

So far, the focus has been put on the epistemological and methodological
challenges faced by post-foundational scholarship, rather than on the
relations between substantive research traditions (Jackson 2011:238). It
remains difficult to precisely know what post-foundationalism implies in
terms of research practices. [The time is ripe then to reflect on the
links between different theories]{.underline} in a post-foundational
perspective. As I show below, this means that the potential
contributions of different theories and the criteria for their selection
must be clarified. Given the pluralist inclinations of this perspective,
these questions are particularly difficult to answer (Hellmann 2003;
Smith 2003; Kurki 2008:208). [[Analytic eclecticism]{.underline}]{.mark}
partially [provides]{.underline} some [indications on how to practice a
post-foundational science of IR]{.underline}. Advocated for by Rudra Sil
and Peter Katzenstein over the past decade, [it [is the most established
and respected kind of problem-driven pragmatism]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Sil 2000a,b, 2004, 2009; Sil and Katzenstein 2010a,b, 2011). Basically,
[an eclectic study uses different theories to analyze substantive
problems]{.underline}. They explain: What we refer to as [[analytic
eclecticism is distinguished by the fact that]{.mark}
features]{.underline} [of]{.underline} analyses in
[[theories]{.underline}]{.mark} initially [embedded [in]{.mark}
[separate]{.mark} research [traditions]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[can be
separated from their]{.mark} respective [foundations]{.mark},
[translated]{.mark} [meaningfully]{.mark}, [and recombined as]{.mark}
part of [an original permutation of concepts, methods, analytics, and
empirics]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Katzenstein and Sil 2008:110--111). In
applying this logic to IR, [[Sil and Katzenstein consider realist,
liberal, and constructivist approaches as **potentially
complementary**]{.mark} in understanding specific
phenomena.]{.underline} The utility of this research program derives
from its giving a place to researchers using a plurality of theories. It
shows that [[problem-driven pragmatism is]{.mark} interesting,
[coherent]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} most importantly,
[possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. This legitimizes research that
transgresses and transcends paradigmatic lines, allowing for eclectic
analyses using theoretical frameworks from different parts of the
epistemological spectrum.4 [The [extensive analysis of substantive
works]{.mark}]{.underline} [provided [shows]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
analytic eclecticism and [problem-driven pragmatism]{.mark} [have
already made great achievements]{.mark}, particularly [in the study of
war and peace]{.mark}, order and governance, and global political
economy]{.underline} (Sil and Katzenstein 2010b). In Jeffrey Checkel's
words, "[bridge builders have largely done their job well]{.underline}"
(2012:220).

#### The permutation has a net benefit -- it avoids paradigms wars and fueling epistemic uncertainty

Many [[international relations scholars view]{.mark} [their fundamental
task as producing better]{.mark}]{.underline} and more accurate
[[knowledge]{.mark} about the world around us.]{.underline}
[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} individuals and [[groups]{.underline}]{.mark}
of researchers in the field [[often]{.mark} self-[organize]{.mark}
[along factional lines]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} may [produce]{.underline}
[practices]{.underline} [that [harm]{.mark}]{.underline} the
accumulation of [[knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}. Scholars routinely
argue that the interparadigm debate undermined the theoretical
development of new research programs. They contend that self-described
"realist," "[[critical]{.underline}]{.mark}," or other typeset
[[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} ultimately [[focus]{.mark} more
[on]{.mark} conceptual [self-affirmation]{.mark} than on producing
nuanced understandings of aspects of world politics]{.underline} (see,
inter alia, Cohen 2007, 2008; Blyth 2009; Maliniak and Tierney 2009;
Lake 2011). However, academic "sects" that form in response to strong
support for a particular perspective on world politics do not
necessarily harm the pursuit of knowledge. Different perspectives may,
for example, bring greater understandings of the role of particular
causal mechanisms. Contestation means forums within which scholarly
consensus might be achieved and from which new efforts can be shaped.
Moreover, different perspectives provide institutional and philosophical
ways to organize and take stock of knowledge. That said, Sil and
Katzenstein (2010) argue that [[the]{.mark} intellectual
[benefits]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [factionalism come **at a high
price**]{.mark} [if not obtained within an environment supportive of
**methodological "eclecticism."**]{.mark}]{.underline} Paradigms become
the object of socialization in that they are taken as given or,
conversely, judged as inappropriate for inclusion in studies in certain
subfields. Likewise, scholars socialized in a particular context may
view certain methods as inappropriate for use in social science research
on specific topics or held up as the gold standard, despite clear
shortcomings or demonstrable benefits. The economic turn in the
international political economy (IPE) field, for example, has diminished
the prominence of qualitative analysis within top journal outlets (Lake
2006; Maliniak and Tierney 2009). This bias leads researchers to develop
self-affirming research designs and to link the viability of particular
methods to their personal or professional reputation (Lake 2011). [When
researchers exhibit these [biases]{.mark}, they [cloud the production of
knowledge about world politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. Naturally, [these
tendencies]{.underline} and subsequent effects [introduce some
uncertainty to the field\'s effort to produce better knowledge about
world politics.]{.underline}

### Perm Solves Best - General

#### The permutation solves best -- even if somewhat inconsistent, combining methodological approaches leads to better scholarship which is ideal for addressing normative problems in actual policy debates

International Relations, "Eclectic Theorizing in the Study and Practice

For most of the past three decades, [[international relations
scholarship has]{.mark} typically [been embedded in discrete research
traditions]{.mark}]{.underline}, each proclaimed by its adherents to be
either inherently superior or flexible enough to be able to subsume the
others. [[Competition]{.mark} among]{.underline} discrete research
[traditions]{.underline} is certainly one motor for intellectual
vitality within a given tradition of international relations (e.g. David
Dessler, this volume). However, vitality within particular traditions
[[does not]{.underline}]{.mark} necessarily
[[constitute]{.underline}]{.mark} a basis for
[[progress]{.underline}]{.mark} for the field of international relations
as a whole (Elman and Elman 2003). As Gunther Hellmann (2002, 3) notes:
"although the sort of professionalization which Waltzian 'realists' and
Wendtian 'constructivists' have helped to bring about in international
relations has rightly and widely been hailed as a blessing, it must not
be mistaken for intellectual progress." The editor of Perspectives in
Politics, one of the two leading journals of the American Political
Science Association, writes about the field from a highly informed
perspective: the [standard IR]{.underline} article [consists of pushing
a huge rock of theory up a steep hill, in order to roll it down to smash
a few pebbles of fact at the bottom.]{.underline} That is, the modal
manuscript starts by outlining the three standard theories: realism,
liberalism, constructivism (sometimes subdivided into neo-realism,
neo-liberalism, and so on). Articles then diverge slightly---some seek
to show that these apparently different theories can really be combined
to show X; others seek to show that one of the theories is right and the
other two are wrong, as evidenced by an explanation of X; a few argue
that none of the three quite suffices to explain X, so we need a new
theory (or more frequently, a variant of one of the old ones).
(Hochschild 2005, 11) The sound editorial advice proffered was to
eliminate paradigms, to focus attention on a central question, and to
engage that question fruitfully---that is, to follow the road of
problem-driven rather than paradigm-driven research. Indeed, a growing
number of scholars, albeit still a minority, have been self-consciously
forgoing metatheoretical and methodological battles in favor of
approaches that explicitly seek to explore the interfaces between, and
build bridges across, problematics and analyses originally constructed
within seemingly incommensurable research traditions (Bernstein et al.
2000; Makinda 2000; Sil and Doherty 2000; Dow 2004; Suh, Katzenstein,
and Carlson 2004; Zürn and Checkel 2005). Because research traditions
are typically founded on metatheoretical principles that are distinct
from those distinguishing competing traditions, each intrinsically
favors some types of scholarly endeavors over others, as evident in the
selection and framing of research puzzles, the representation and
interpretation of relevant empirical observations, the specification of
evidentiary standards, and the attention to certain causal mechanisms at
the expense of others. [Given the lack of a definitive consensus
on]{.underline} such [fundamental issues]{.underline},
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} chapter [[calls]{.underline}
[for]{.underline}]{.mark} the accommodation of [[eclectic]{.mark} modes
of [scholarship]{.mark} that trespass]{.underline} deliberately and
liberally [across competing research traditions]{.underline} with the
intention of defining and exploring substantive problems in original,
creative ways, selectively drawing upon a variety of existing and
emerging research traditions in order to contribute to theoretical
progress for international relations as a whole. What we refer to as
[analytic eclecticism]{.underline} is distinguished by the fact that
features of analyses in theories initially embedded in separate research
traditions can be separated from their respective foundations,
translated meaningfully, and recombined as part of [[an original
permutation]{.mark} of concepts, methods, analytics, and
empirics]{.underline}. Our conception of [analytic
eclecticism]{.underline} is premised on a pragmatist foundation that
[eschews metatheoretical debates and [encourages]{.mark} scholarly
practices aimed at generating [creative forms of knowledge]{.mark} that
engage adherents of different traditions in meaningful conversations
about substantive problems in international life. [Analytic
eclecticism]{.mark}]{.underline} also [suggests a reflexive process
aimed at generating fresh theoretical perspectives that [have practical
value beyond the academe]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[speaking to both the
normative and policy debates in which actors in international relations
are enmeshed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This does not suggest that anything
goes or that established research traditions need to be dismantled.
Rather, following Albert Hirschman (1981), we note that self-conscious
"[[trespassing" across research traditions]{.mark} [can]{.mark}
[enable]{.mark} us to make better use of the [innovative]{.mark} [and
creative scholarship]{.mark} produced within these traditions in [the
process of recognizing socially important problems and building
interpretations]{.mark} and hypotheses [that]{.mark}, **[even if not
especially parsimonious]{.mark}**, [can be analytically coherent,
intellectually interesting, and responsive to normative concerns and
policy debates surrounding these problems]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Perm Solves Best -- Security K

#### Security studies lack an empirical foundation -- reject this flawed methodology in favor of pluralism

Stephanie **Baele** **and** Diana **Jalea**, **2022**, Political Studies
Review, "twenty-five years of securitization theory: a corpus-based
review,"
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/14789299211069499, mm

Our first axis of investigation follows the line of argument claiming
that a rich and fastpaced theoretical evolution of ST \[securitization
theory\] may have been done at the expense of a similarly strong
development when it comes to methods. On the one hand, theoretical
developments in ST \[securitization theory\] have certainly been rapid
and diverse. The 'new framework for analysis' offered by the Copenhagen
School in the mid-1990s has been persistently and significantly
reinforced, expanded and broadened away from its focus on securitizing
speech acts to encompass a range of different processes and factors
surrounding or directly at play in securitization dynamics (Baele and
Thomson, 2022); this broadening shed light on important social and
political issues, enabling a fuller capture of a phenomenon as
multifaceted as securitization. However, it also effectively fragmented
ST \[securitization theory\] into different theories of securitization12
'committed to distinctive ontologies and epistemologies' as well as
methodologies (Balzacq, 2015: 103), a situation that prompted efforts to
reconcile differing views into unified frameworks (e.g. Bourbeau, 2014).
On the other hand, [[comparably little attention has been devoted
to]{.mark} methods and best methodological practices when it comes to
[empirical work]{.mark}]{.underline}. ST's \[[[securitization
theory's]{.underline}\] [methods have]{.underline}]{.mark} [several
times [been criticized as]{.mark} limited, **if not [outright
weak]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Calls have been voiced to move beyond
theoretical debates and conduct methodologically rich empirical work
(e.g. Balzacq, 2011), and the lack of methodological transparency in
applied research has been pinpointed (e.g. Baele and Sterck \[2015:
1122\] argued that [[methods are 'the Achilles' heel of securitisation
studies, **casting doubt on their conclusions**]{.underline}]{.mark}').
In their recent evaluation of ST \[securitization theory\], Balzacq et
al. (2016: 519) still wondered if 'there \[is\] a "better" method for
studying securitization processes?' Overall, [[this imbalanced
development is confirmed by the data in several
ways]{.underline}]{.mark}. First, ST \[[[securitization theory\]
scholarship is indeed heavily geared towards theoretical development
rather than empirical knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}: more than half of
the 171 papers (89) were 'primarily theoretical', compared with only 10
'primarily empirical' articles -- the remaining being 'balanced
theoretically and empirically'. As Figure 2 shows, only a minority of
papers do 'focus on a key issue', that is, have a clearly identifiable
and sustained engagement with one (or two) empirical case.13 Put
differently, [[the majority of]{.underline}]{.mark} ST
\[[[securitization theory\] scholarship remains abstract, with only thin
empirical engagement]{.underline}]{.mark}. As noted above, this
imbalance in favour of abstract theorizing as opposed to case(s)-based
investigations can partially be explained by the nature of the journals
we included in the sample; a quick glance at some area studies
publications brings back articles using ST \[securitization theory\] in
a more instrumental way to explain particular issues or events.
Generalist journals, however, do not necessarily neglect empirical work
when favouring theorization -- they usually require both. We thus
believe that what has more fundamentally driven this imbalance is the
value traditionally given to 'high' theory, and suspicion towards
'methods' at times conflated with positivism, within the critical IR
community.14 Theorization is not, of course, inherently problematic;
what raises questions is a theoretical framework which is usually not
used as such -- as a tool used to better understand specific issues and
solve empirical puzzles that incidentally allow for further conceptual
work.

### Net Benefit -- Balkanization

#### The permutation provides the best fusion of inquiry and knowledge -- the alternative alone fails to persuade real world actors and leads to the balkanization of knowledge and epistemic communities

P. **Katzenstein** **and** Rudra **Sil**, **2008**, Oxford Handbook of
International Relations, "Eclectic Theorizing in the Study and Practice

We concur with Robert Dahl (2004) that, because politics encompasses an
extraordinarily complex set of phenomena involving multiple types of
units connected through a wide range of relations, understanding this
complexity initially requires a more specialized examination of
particular elements, institutions, and actors. The analytic accentuation
and empirical focus facilitated by the boundaries of research traditions
can be intellectually fruitful, enabling scholars with similar
assumptions, vocabularies, standards, and skill sets to examine more
thoroughly selected aspects of a problem. Moreover, debates among
adherents of multiple research traditions can generate progress within
each tradition as scholars respond to critiques and alternative
knowledge claims generated in competing traditions. However,
[[viewing]{.underline}]{.mark} social [[inquiry]{.underline}]{.mark}
[solely [through]{.mark} the lens of [competing research
traditions]{.mark} [risks]{.mark} **excessive [compartmentalization of
knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline} unless some effort is made to
illuminate connections and complementarities between the various
problems, interpretations, and mechanisms posited by different research
traditions. As Shapiro (2005, 184) notes, because scholarship embedded
in a single approach reflects the theoretical priors privileged by that
approach, social inquiry is inherently restricted to those aspects of
the social world that can be readily problematized relying on the
preferred conceptual apparatus and methodological toolkit of that
approach. Thus, while the [[debates]{.mark} among research
traditions]{.underline} may generate refinements within each tradition,
they also [serve to [block]{.mark} [off]{.mark}]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} sort of [[communication]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
intellectual versatility needed to recognize potentially relevant
conceptual and empirical connections across analyses developed in
separate traditions]{.underline}. In security studies, for example,
articles in each of two leading journals---Journal of Conflict
Resolution and International Security---rarely acknowledge scholarship
produced in the other, even when considering the same topic (Bennett,
Barth, and Rutherford 2003). Moreover, there are very large
intellectual, financial, professional, and psychological investments
that go into producing and sustaining a research tradition, and these
investments militate against addressing important aspects of problems
that are not easily represented in the conceptual apparatus and analytic
frameworks privileged in that tradition. As Friedrich Kratochwil (2003,
125) puts it: "[[The desire to win]{.mark},]{.underline} to stand one's
ground, perhaps not surprisingly, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} most of the
time [[stronger]{.underline}]{.mark} [[than]{.mark} [the]{.mark} genuine
[search for an acceptable solution]{.mark} to a problem." [To]{.mark}
overcome]{.underline} these [barriers to intellectual
engagement]{.underline}, to gain depth in insight and improve the
accuracy of observations [and]{.underline}, especially, to
[[make]{.underline} [research]{.underline}]{.mark} more
[[relevant]{.underline} [to]{.underline}]{.mark} the practical and
normative concerns of [re[al-world actors]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [it
is]{.underline}]{.mark} [intellectually [productive to
reconsider]{.mark} a problem from the vantage point of a
"[multiperspectival]{.mark} mode of [social
inquiry]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Bohman 2002, 502). [This is where the
very advantages that enable adherents of a research tradition to
proclaim progress become disadvantages in terms of exploring real-world
puzzles that force scholars to confront the question of the empirical
accuracy and the practical and normative relevance of their work rather
than justify their work primarily on methodological or epistemological
grounds]{.underline} (Grofman 2001). [[The benefits of embedding
scholarship within research traditions]{.underline}]{.mark}---the
cultivation of a recognizable professional identity, efficient
communication based on shared stocks of knowledge and skills, a common
set of evaluative standards linked to explicit methodological
assumptions, and the psychological and institutional support provided by
fellow members--- [[need to be]{.mark} [sacrificed]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
the purpose of recognizing and framing problems in ways that more
closely approximate the complexity of the social world and that can be
explored through different [permutations of]{.mark}]{.underline}
concepts, data, [[methods]{.underline}]{.mark}, and interpretative
logics taken from separate research traditions. [As]{.underline}
distinct [scholarly]{.underline} [communities seek to make their
intellectual products relevant to policy-makers]{.underline} and other
actors, [[eclectic scholarship enables these communities]{.mark} to
recognize related aspects of a problem and [to move toward richer
interpretative frameworks]{.mark} that selectively integrate
artificially segmented schemes and logics initially devised in separate
research traditions]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} [emergent]{.mark}
theoretical [framework]{.mark}, [whatever its
limitations]{.mark}]{.underline} with regard to such scientific ideals
as parsimony and replicability, [[comes to constitute "a tool for
problem-solving rather than an instrument for
truthproduction]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Hellmann 2002, 7).

#### The alt's scholarship alone leads to academic fragmentation and fails to promote material change

David **Lake**, June **2011**, "Why 'isms' are evil: theory,
epistemology, and academic sects as impediments to understanding and
progress," International Studies Quarterly, 55(2), 465-480,
https://www.jstor.org/stable/23019696?seq=1, mm

The problem is not that we have too many research traditions, but how we
respond to this plethora. Nor is the problem our professional structures
and incentives, as many other disciplines operate within the same
environment and have responded in more productive ways.\' Rather, [[we
have adopted]{.underline}]{.mark} over time a set of professional
practices that produce five linked pathologies.\" These patholo-gies, in
turn, transform [[research traditions]{.underline}]{.mark} into insular
\"sects\" [[that eschew expla-nation]{.mark} in favor of
theology.]{.underline} Fortunately, if these pathologies follow from
professional practices, they can be remedied by changing those norms.
Recogniz-ing these practices and highlighting their effects is a
necessary first step toward change. First, we reify research traditions.
We are all familiar with the mandatory literature review in articles and
books wherein complex literatures are grouped into one or more schools
for the primary purpose of demonstrating what is new and unique about
the author\'s own contribution. These are necessary for positioning our
work in the field. We likewise organize courses---and especially
introductory courses and graduate field seminars---in terms of the
\"great debates\" or \"great books\" where we assign exemplary works
that help students identify the core traits of each tradition. We also
organize our handbooks of international studies by research tradition
(see Reus-Smit and Snidal 2008). This is how we introduce novices into
the shared understanding of the field and its practices. In classifying
research into such categories, we collectively construct the research
traditions in which we live. But in classifying research in these ways,
we also necessarily lose subtlety, emphasize lowest common denominators,
and simplify scholarly inquiry into easily recognizable schools. In
short, through often well-intentioned prac-tice, we force research into
artificial traditions that we mistakenly believe have real standing and
meaning. Sometimes, categories are also self-imposed as scholars search
for a shared identity with like-minded others. [[We are]{.mark} active
[participants in]{.mark} creating [our own professional
fragmentation]{.mark}.]{.underline} More insidiously, however, even
while perhaps pro-claiming our own broadmindedness and denying that
\"our work\" fits cleanly into any particular research tradition, we
nonetheless classify others into these neat, simplified categories.\'
[We may believe ourselves to defy academic stereo-types, but we are
usually all too ready to label our intellectual opponents]{.underline}
as a this or a that. Just like ethnic identities in times of conflict,
it matters less how we may think of ourselves and more how others think
of us. We may congratu-late ourselves on our intellectual
cosmopolitanism and flexibility, but we are in the end branded by others
as adherents to one or another tradition and cred-ited---or more likely
damned---with all of the failings of the approach. One\'s research
tradition is not entirely of one\'s own making. Second, [having reified
research traditions, we then reward extremism.]{.underline} We all cite
the same canonical sources in our own and other research traditions.\'
We assign these same works in our courses. These canonical works are
typically read to embody the assumptions of a research tradition in pure
form. Their purpose is to communicate meaning and information to other
scholars---citing \"Waltz 1979,\" \"Keohane 1984,\" or \"Wendt 1999,\"
for instance, carries a world of meaning to sophisticates who have
learned the research traditions. These canoni-cal works serve a useful
purpose by orienting debates within the field. Although they are
typically bold, clear statements of a new approach, like the research
traditions they come to embody these iconic works are themselves
reified, with meanings attributed to them that the author may not have
intended. In interpretation, they lose subtlety, sophistication,
and---most important---qualification. [[Wendt]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
instance, [[has written that]{.mark}, [properly
understood]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [many of the issues between
rationalism and constructivism dissolve]{.underline}]{.mark} (Fearon and
Wendt 2002, 67). Keohane (1984, esp. 9 and 245), in his own writings,
has always posi-tioned himself between traditions as beginning from
realist foundations and then developing the role of institutions on that
footing. Nonetheless, these canonical works are commonly interpreted by
the international studies community as staking out intellectual
positions that are notable precisely for their \"purity\" or, more
accurately, their extremism. These canonical works---in their stylized
and reified forms---shape the disci-pline. Sitting at the top of the
profession, in turn, their authors receive dispro-portionate
professional rewards, not least because our universities and profession
value visibility, whether defined in terms of citations or valuable
space on gradu-ate syllabi. These rewards are appropriate in recognizing
the unusual contribu-tions of scholars whose research sets the agenda in
the field. But these rewards also create incentives for younger scholars
to compete for recognition by adher-ing to a sectarian position and,
more important, taking even more extreme posi-tions. Indeed, although
everyone writing on international studies no doubt hopes to make an
impact on the discipline and our understanding of world affairs, authors
of canonical works---aware that they are breaking new ground ---are
often quite sensitive to how they fit into and are dependent on existing
streams of political thought. In the quest for recognition, however,
their followers often become more shrill and single-minded, further
reifying the approaches with which they identify. For reasons of
self-identification and increased professional visibility, we also
create incentives for adherents of nascent approaches to create new
\"isms,\" often embodied in new organized sections that they can control
within profes-sional associations. Creating a new section provides a
measure of legitimacy, standing, and status for adherents and certifies
the approach as one that should be taken seriously by others. It also
provides opportunities for entrepreneurs to earn visibility in general
and become intellectual leaders of a new research tradi-tion. [[If there
is a tendency in academia towards intellectual fragmentation, the
disproportionate rewards for intellectual extremism create a further
centripetal force]{.mark}.]{.underline} Ironically, professional
associations, often originally formed as a common ground for scholars,
become a force for further fractionalization in the disci-pline. At both
the individual and collective levels, extremism breeds further
extremism. Together, these first two pathologies lead to a proliferation
of research tradi-tions within international studies. The existence of
these multiple traditions is not in itself a bad thing. To the extent
that they organize research and produce new ideas they can be
progressive. But when combined with three further patho-logies, they
begin to inhibit rather than aid scholarly inquiry. Third, we mistake
research traditions for actual theories. As noted, traditions are
defined by shared sets of core assumptions. In principle, these core
assumptions may be sufficient to generate deductively valid hypotheses
or other forms of explanation. In practice, however, these shared
assumptions are more often incomplete and must be supplemented by
additional assumptions to yield spe-cific hypotheses and explanations.
That is, the core assumptions orient scholars working within a research
tradition, but they are seldom complete enough to explain specific
outcomes of interest. Waltz (1979:118, 121), for instance, was emphatic
that two and only two assumptions---anarchy and the desire to
sur-vive---were sufficient to predict that states will tend to balance
against stronger powers. But these assumptions are, in fact, consistent
with a much larger range of behaviors, including cooperation and
collective security organizations, on the one hand, and bandwagoning, on
the other. In other words, these same assump-tions are consistent with
both balancing and not balancing, and thus, the research tradition is
theoretically indeterminate (Lake and Powell 1999:23-24). To deduce the
proposition that states tend to balance, additional assumptions must be
added to the core assumptions of neorealism. Similarly, Powell (1991)
and Snidal (1991a,b) showed that both neorealism and neoliberalism did
not generate unique predictions about relative and absolute gains
maximization, as commonly thought (Grieco 1993), but were actually
indeterminate as well; with additional assumptions, each tradition could
generate predictions of relative and absolute gains behavior as a
special case. That most research traditions are insuf-ficient to
generate hypotheses about actual interstate behavior is further
sug-gested by the proliferation of theories within each that all claim
allegiance to the same core assumptions. Thus, we have offensive
realism, defensive realism, neoclassical realism, and more, all sharing
a common set of assumptions under-stood as realist but differing in the
auxiliary assumptions they employ.\' This explains how numerous theories
can co-exist and be unified within a single research tradition.\'° In
turn, since their assumptions are typically incomplete, [research
traditions cannot be assessed directly. As they are often underspecified
and do not gener-ate deductively valid hypotheses themselves, they
cannot be \"tested\" on their own terms]{.underline}. Sometimes, since
with different auxiliary assumptions they may pre-dict both a behavior
and its opposite, they cannot be tested at all. One can probe the
explanatory power of a theory, but usually not of a tradition.
Nonethe-less, [[scholars]{.mark} often pit [traditions against one
another]{.mark} in head-to-head competi-tions.]{.underline}\" **[[In
these battles,]{.mark} since each tradition is incomplete and yields few
logically deductive predictions, [no empirical evidence can shed any
meaningful light on the explanatory power of the approach]{.mark} or,
inversely, broad ranges of behavior may be equally consistent with its
assumptions]{.underline}**. [[Without determinate predictions, scholars
play a game of \"heads I win, tails you lose\" in which their preferred
approach is almost always supported]{.underline}]{.mark}. Fourth, we
narrow the permitted subject matter of our studies to those topics,
periods, and observations that tend to confirm the particular strengths
of our tradition. Realists, for instance, tend to focus mainly on
security policies of great powers where their assumptions appear to fit
slightly better, and then find evidence for the power of realism.
Liberals tend to focus on economic policy where their assump-tions
appear to fit slightly better, and then find evidence for the power of
liberal-ism. Neoliberal institutionalists study institutions, which not
coincidentally tends to affirm the important role of institutions.
Constructivists study changes in norms, and find their approach
persuasive. English school scholars often focus on the socialization of
polities within the international system, and find evidence of the power
of their approach and so on. This narrowing of empirical focus need not
be a conscious strategy but can be a natural by-product of the search
for confirming evidence. Having spent years developing a theory, it is
not unrea-sonable to apply it where it is most likely to fit---at least
as a first, initial test of plausibility. Journals and book publishers
are also notoriously loath to publish null findings, a belief that need
not be true to have a major effect on the choice of research topics by
scholars of different traditions. By narrowing its empirical focus,
however, each tradition affirms itself by study-ing that which it does
best and ignoring subjects that do not conform to expecta-tions. This
produces self-affirming sects that come to believe in the power of their
tradition based on a selective reading of the possible empirical
evidence. It is here that research traditions move from the realm of
objective social science to theology. Having adopted a tradition, we
then look only for evidence that affirms our prior belief in the
rightness of that tradition. Practice becomes not an attempt to falsify
theories through ever more demanding tests, but to support theories that
were adopted prior to their confrontation with evidence. In essence, we
eschew social science theories that can, in principle, be falsified for
beliefs that are largely impervious to evidence. Fifth, scholars within
each research tradition aspire for their approach to be the scientific
paradigm. [[Rather than accept that our]{.mark} favored tradition
[is]{.mark} inevitably partial and [limited]{.mark} in scope and domain,
[we seek intellectual hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [We claim
that our particular tradition with its unique set of assumptions is a
general approach that can and should be treated as a universal or near
universal paradigm.]{.underline} I have always found the phrases \"I am
realist\" or \"As a neoliberal institutionalist, I think\...\" to be
peculiar statements. The only logical construction is that the speaker
is asserting that his or her particular tradition is superior to all
other known traditions, a claim that all questions can be answered by
theories based on the assumptions of that tradition. Thus, by the third
and fourth pathologies, we validate our often incomplete theories
through favorable and selective evidence but, by the fifth, we then
assert they are universal and superior to---or at least worthy of
respect by adherents of---other equally self-validated traditions. There
are, perhaps, strong reasons of self-identification to seek intellectual
hegemony. As scholars, much of our self-worth is entwined with our
ideas. To vanquish the alternatives, if even in our own minds, validates
our contributions and ourselves. There are also strong professional
incentives to win the contest for intellectual hegemony. To establish
one\'s tradition as the tradition promises to put the original adherents
at the top of the field. Even if individual scholars are not so narrowly
instrumental, intellectual combat is like an arms race. Each tradition
perceives the failure to compete for hegemony as ceding ground to
opponents, and thus, each tradition believes it must compete in
expectation that others will compete for dominance. To admit the partial
nature of one\'s theory is to risk being subsumed as a special case
within someone else\'s tradition---a lower status. Thus, everyone
aspires to hegemony if only to prevent others from conquering the field.
But like arms races, [this intellectual competition leaves everyone
worse off than if they could simply cooperate, which in this case means
admitting the partial nature and limited empirical evidence for every
theory now known in the field.]{.underline} [These]{.underline} five
pathologies [combine to divert professional debate from the sub-stance
of world politics to first principles.]{.underline} Having created
academic sects based on incommensurate assumptions and supported by
selective evidence, we do not seek to assess which approach helps us
understand world politics best (or helps us understand which range of
phenomena best). We focus instead on the inher-ent superiority of this
or that set of assumptions. [[Rather than seeking to under-stand the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}---our highest obligation as scholars---[[we
debate assumptions]{.mark} seemingly [without
end]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} What are the fundamental units of
world politics? Are individuals, groups or social collectivities, or
organizations \"rational\"? Do actors seek power, welfare, justice, or
something else? Which matters more, system or unit, structure or agency?
Without comparable propositions derived from these competing research
traditions and assessed against the same patterns of behav-ior, there is
no possible answer to such existential questions.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} makes for a continuing and lively debate of
course, but it [**[adds little to our understanding of world politics
and nothing at all to practical policymakers]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[[Rather than seeking to understand the]{.mark} complex and often
frightening [world]{.mark} around us, [we spend far too much of our
intellectual time and energy debating assumptions as if they mattered in
absolute terms]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is here that research traditions
tip over from being useful organizing devices to theologies. Assumptions
stop being treated as more or less useful simplifications of a complex
reality and become beliefs that are accepted or not as truths. We have
left the realm of scholarly inquiry and entered the world of academic
religions. By whatever definition, we have stopped doing \"science.\"

### Net Benefit -- Cooption

#### Reliance on critical IR theory fails and gets coopted -- these intellectual tools are just as likely to be mobilized by populists to oppress other marginalized groups 

Nicholas **Michelsen**, **2021**, "What is minor international theory?
On the limits of Critical International Relations," Journal of
International Political Theory, 17(3),
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1755088220956680, mm

The problem of synthesis stalks all self-defining Critical approaches to
IR. Defining the terms of reference for intellectual dissidence in
relation to IR's 'disciplinary crisis', as the poststructuralists did in
viewing critique as a function of disciplinary marginality, created
conditions ripe for viewing any competitor theory as problematic to the
degree that they can be deemed insufficiently minor (Whitehall, 2016).
[The idea that critique necessitates moving 'beyond IR']{.underline} as
an inherently majoritarian project [has become a widely expressed
trope.]{.underline} The result is that Critical IR theorists now engage
in increasingly virulent disagreements over the political and ethical
implications of disciplinarity itself. In perpetual abeyance, [claimants
to Critical IR become hostages to a continuous risk of being exposed as
insufficiently pure of the (modernist, racist, colonial, patriarchal,
heteronormative, positivist, capitalist) traces of 'the
major]{.underline} literature/[discipline']{.underline}. At the same
time, [[Critical IR scholars]{.mark} who advocate for a disciplinary
exit in search of 'more Critical' inter-disciplines have found
themselves wrestling with the charge of pre-judgement]{.underline}:
Since they appear to know what 'Being Critical' will look like after
de-disciplinarisation, [critique takes the form of testing whether other
scholars meet these pre-given criteria]{.underline} (Holden, 2006;
Howell and Richter-Montpetit, 2020). [This stream in contemporary IR
scholarship [ignores the manners in which minor theories,]{.mark} far
from tending towards alliances, [are often set to contradictory
political and ethical purposes]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[And that the
visions of world politics created by scholars 'moving beyond'
disciplinary IR can be just as problematic as visions already settled
within the discipline]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Contemporary political and
social movements borrow intellectual resources from various (once or
still) minor theoretical traditions in IR to think against a 'Globalist'
world order, incorporating the Gramscian position that 'politics is
downstream from culture', the ideal of a transgressive emancipatory
identity, and the critique of neo-colonialism (Love, 2017; Nagle 2017).
[[The philosopher]{.underline} [Alain De Benoist wrote his
manifesto]{.underline} [for the New Right]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
year 2000 [with the aim of challenging the oppressive implications of
major international theories,]{.underline} especially Liberalism,
[[borrowing widely from]{.mark} resources of [minor intellectual
critique]{.mark}]{.underline} (de Benoist and Champetier, 1999).
[[This]{.mark} [theory]{.mark} [is]{.mark} marginal in disciplinary IR,
but [influential amongst populist politicians]{.mark} [like]{.mark}
Putin, [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}, Orban, Salvini [and Le Pen, as well
as online communities of Race Realists, western chauvinists, and white
nationalists.]{.underline} It proposes that Liberalism destroys the
autonomy of ethnicities and cultures, and that the history of the west
has been one of ongoing cultural as well as political colonialism. De
Benoist's argument is that the project of decolonisation is incomplete,
and continues through international aid and UN-led Liberal paternalism.
The answer proposed by the New Right is to restore a truly independent
status to diverse cultures and indigenous world-views in International
Relations, and suggest that people belonging to these 'birth-cultures'
must actively work towards their national and cognitive emancipation
from all the baggage of Liberal modernity, if necessary, through
violently closing borders. The New Right claims its intellectual
marginality vis-à-vis Liberalism or Globalism (understood as the
ideological representative of modernism in international thought) is a
marker of its virtue. The New Right is not, however, widely viewed as a
'Critical ally' of Decolonial IR theory. [[A claim to minor theoretical
status is also visible amongst reactionary theorists of gender,
including]{.mark} online groups of men's rights activists, western
chauvinist militias like [the Proud Boys]{.mark}, or traditionalist
'family values' movements]{.underline} (Nagle, 2017). These groups
develop an operative concept of the radical intellectual margins as
central to their understandings of critique, and of the emancipatory
relationship which their critique has to hegemonic theoretical
frameworks that they perceive as oppressing them: Liberalism or
'Cultural Marxism' (Nagle, 2017). These actors see their critiques of
what they term 'gender ideology' as part of a necessary escape from the
straightjacket of modernist categories, currently hegemonic in
contemporary academia. In other words, [the]{.underline} [belief that
transgressive or marginal theory is emancipatory has diverse advocates,
whose antimodernism or anti-hegemonism comes with divergent attitudes to
gender, race, culture, economics, social, political and international
organisation]{.underline}. The sociological implications of this point
were anticipated, but not fully developed, by Katz (1996: 488), who
noted that: '[[talk of exclusion can lead to an unsavory hierarchy of
marginalization]{.underline}]{.mark} -- **[a kind of competitive
victimology]{.underline}** -- [and even to the cul-de-sac of an
essentialist identity politics]{.underline}. [[Notions of
exclusion]{.mark} are all about,]{.underline} one might even say
tautologically about, [position]{.underline}, [and if we are not careful
they can lead to relativist accounts that offer little of practical
value]{.underline}. [And they [can be disingenuous]{.mark}]{.underline}
-- [proclamations of exclusion by scholars who are quite
included']{.underline}. [The historical moment facing critique calls us
to recognise that minor theories infer no allied ethics or
politics]{.underline}. There is no cohesive and abiding sovereign 'logic
of modernity' that forms the superstructure of disciplinary IR, and
gives assurance that the postdisciplinary avant-guard will share an
understanding of virtue. [The romanticism characteristic of
self-describing Critical intellectual cultures that arose in IR in the
immediate Post-Cold War context must now be reconsidered]{.underline}.
**[[Many of the same intellectual tools are now being effectively
mobilised by reactionaries, racists and gender
absolutists]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Contemporary reactionaries have read
their Deleuze, their Gramsci, their Derrida and Foucault (see Land,
2012), and they are cognisant of the discursive logic and rhetorical
power of, for example, concepts of exclusion, identity, precarity,
marginality, hegemony, the avant-guard, victimhood and indigeneity (see
Michelsen and De Orellana, 2019). [The challenge facing scholars in IR
who seek to write in the service of vulnerable groups,]{.underline} like
migrants lacking a safe home state, those who do not fit with
heteronormative gender roles, or the victims of racism[, is that their
reactionary theoretical interlocutors have recognised the power in
claiming to be uniquely reflexive critics, intellectually marginal
vis-à-vis dominant theoretical assumptions about IR]{.underline}. [[The
category 'Critical IR' provides no tools by which to counter these
relativistic arguments]{.underline}.]{.mark} [In this context, the
belief that '[Being Critical']{.mark} requires a minoritarian exit from
disciplinary IR [may be a distraction from developing **methodologically
and epistemologically rigorous critiques**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [that
can be communicated as such]{.underline}. Faith in the emancipatory
intellectual margins brings to mind Latour's (2004: 225) worry that
self-describing '[[Critical' scholars today are like 'those mechanical
toys that endlessly make the same gesture when everything else has
changed around them]{.mark}']{.underline}.

### Net Benefit -- Epistemic Tradeoffs

#### The alternative alone guarantees epistemic tradeoffs that undermine its solvency -- the permutation avoids this

Politics, "Analytic eclecticism in the study of world politics:
reconfiguring problems and mechanisms across research traditions," 8(2),

mm

[[Research traditions have]{.mark} crucial [advantages in
generating]{.mark} and organizing [initial stocks of
knowledge]{.mark}.]{.underline} Given the infinite complexity of social
reality and the limited resources available to scholars, it is helpful
to establish some common assumptions, parameters, vocabularies, and
conventions to facilitate a focused examination of selected aspects of
that reality. These common understandings also enable adherents of
research traditions to establish a consensus on what criteria might be
appropriate for assessing the quality of research and for evaluating
progress in a given field. Moreover, "creative confrontations"Footnote13
among rival scholarly traditions serve as models or foils that prod
adherents of research traditions to apply concepts and theories to new
arenas of research, demonstrating their relevance to substantive issues
on which other traditions claim to have more insights to offer. For
example, in international relations, realism initially provided a common
conceptual apparatus for framing and investigating problems related to
the outbreak of war, the formation of alliances, and the distribution of
capabilities among states. Similarly, modernization theory in
comparative politics provided a common framework for formulating
questions and generating comparable data on the relationships between
economic, social, and political change across vast expanses of time and
space. In both instances, shared boundary conditions and theoretical
vocabularies employed by adherents of a research tradition facilitated
the production and assessment of new knowledge claims concerning new
phenomena. Later, these arguments invited challenges and became foils
for newer research traditions, as in the case of neoliberalism and
constructivism in international relations or of rational-choice theory
and historical institutionalism in comparative politics. Each of these
newer traditions distinguished itself by distinct sets of foundational
assumptions that facilitated the creation of new problematiques and new
analytic frameworks that helped to expand the range of substantive
arguments and the stocks of empirical knowledge in its respective field.
To the extent that this stylized process is a reasonable representation
of the changes that have occurred in the two subfields, it reveals why
the emergence of, and competition between, research traditions can
expand the fund of ideas, concepts, observations, and theories for a
field. [[These]{.underline}]{.mark} intellectual
[[benefits]{.underline}]{.mark} are valuable and should not be
forfeited. However, they [[come at a high price]{.mark} [in the absence
of]{.mark} a counterweight in the form of [eclectic]{.mark} modes of
[inquiry]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Research]{.underline}
[traditions]{.underline} establish their identities and boundaries by
insisting on a strong consensus on enduring and irreconcilable
foundational issues. [This]{.underline}, in turn,
[effectively]{.underline} [privileges some concepts over others, rewards
certain methodological norms and practices but not others, and places
great weight on certain aspects of social reality while ignoring
others.]{.underline} In fact, the battles among research traditions
recur not because of hardened differences over substantive issues but
over preexisting epistemic convictions about what kinds of social
phenomena are amenable to social analysis, what kinds of questions are
important to ask, and what kinds of processes and mechanisms are most
likely to be relevant. Research traditions give themselves permission to
bypass aspects of a complex reality that do not neatly fit within the
metatheoretical parameters they have established by fiat. These aspects
are either "blackboxed," relegated to "context," or treated as
"exogenous." Such simplifying moves, while helpful for the purpose of
generating elegant knowledge claims about particular aspects of reality,
are not independently capable of generating a more comprehensive
understanding of complex, multi-faceted problems that interest scholars
and policymakers alike. For this purpose, [[scholarly analysis needs
to]{.mark} be more open-ended, proceeding from ontologies
that]{.underline}, as Peter Hall notes, [[embrace]{.underline}]{.mark}
"more extensive endogeneity and the ubiquity of [[complex interaction
effects]{.underline}]{.mark}."Footnote14 [This is where analytic
eclecticism has a distinctive role to play alongside, and in engagement
with, different strands of scholarship embedded in multiple research
traditions]{.underline}. Our defense of analytic eclecticism takes its
cue from Albert Hirschman\'s famous observation: "ordinarily, social
scientists are happy enough when they have gotten hold of one paradigm
or line of causation. As a result, their guesses are often farther off
the mark than those of the experienced politician whose intuition is
more likely to take a variety of forces into account." That is not to
say that paradigms are not "useful for the apprehending of many
elements" in the unfolding of large-scale social transformations; but,
for Hirschman, the paradigm-focused social scientist tends to focus on
only some forces and ignore others, thereby running the risk of "a
particularly high degree of error."Footnote15 Hirschman\'s position is
not without empirical backing. [In a study of judgmental accuracy under
different modes of decision-making]{.underline}, Philip
[Tetlock]{.underline} has [suggested that [grossly inaccurate forecasts
are more likely to result when experts behave like "intellectually
aggressive hedgehogs]{.mark}]{.underline}[," [relying on a single
parsimonious approach to explain many things]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
depending excessively upon "powerful abstractions to organize messy
facts and to distinguish the possible from the
impossible]{.underline}."Footnote16 [[Better forecasts are more likely
when experts behave more like "eclectic foxes"]{.mark} who are able "to
blend hedgehog arguments" and improvise ad hoc solutions in a rapidly
changing world rather than becoming "anchored down by theory-laden
abstractions]{.underline}."Footnote17 More recently, Scott Page has
argued that [[long-term progress and innovation are more likely when
a]{.mark} society or group [depends]{.mark} [less]{.mark} [on]{.mark}
singular solutions offered by brilliant individuals or [like-minded
experts and]{.mark} instead [pools]{.mark} [together a broader range of
ideas]{.mark} generated by diverse groups of people]{.underline}. Based
on his studies of a wide range of social and institutional settings,
Page contends: "collections of people with diverse perspectives and
heuristics outperform collections of people who rely on homogeneous
perspectives and heuristics."Footnote18 In the context of Ancient
Greece, Josiah Ober makes a similar observation in the process of
analyzing how Athens emerged as the "preeminent Greek polis by a very
substantial margin." The key, Ober argues, was "the distinctive Athenian
approach to the aggregation, alignment, and codification of useful
knowledge ... dispersed across a large and diverse
population...."Footnote19 What all of these authors are suggesting in
quite different ways is that, [whatever the immediate intellectual
payoffs of employing a particular approach, [reliance on any one
perspective involves tradeoffs that become]{.mark} increasingly
[costly]{.mark} in the absence of complementary and countervailing
efforts to draw upon multiple and diverse approaches]{.underline}.
[[Analytic eclecticism is]{.mark} such an effort, [a means]{.mark} for
social scientists [to guard against the risks of excessive reliance on a
single analytic framework and the simplifying assumptions that come with
it]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### AT Perm Fails -- "Coopts the Alternative"

#### The perm enables an eclectic understanding of resistance -- this is possible even if the core theories of the aff and alt are inconsistent 

Rudra **Sil** **and** Peter **Katzenstein**, **2010**, Perspectives on
Politics, "Analytic eclecticism in the study of world politics:

mm

[[One area where we see efforts to broaden the scope of problems is the
study of social movements]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the past, relative
deprivation theory (e.g., Ted Gurr), macro-structuralist accounts (e.g.,
Theda Skocpol), resource mobilization theory (e.g., Charles Tilly),
rational choice theory (e.g., Dennis Chong), opportunity-structure
arguments (e.g., Sidney Tarrow), and "framing" approaches (e.g., Robert
Benford and David Snow) have been presented as discrete traditions in
the analysis of social movements.Footnote61 [Although usually presented
as competing perspectives, [these approaches are]{.mark} organized
around related but different questions, each [focused on a different
segment of the process whereby grievances]{.mark} ultimately [lead to a
transformation of the status quo]{.mark}]{.underline}. Relative
deprivation and rational choice theories are primarily concerned with
the process through which individual grievances are aggregated into
collective protest. They focus, respectively, on the psychological
dynamics and cost-benefit calculations that spur individuals to commit
to risky forms of collective action. What antecedent conditions created
the choice situations facing these actors and what factors are necessary
for a movement to succeed are not problematized. Structuralist
approaches focus on the question of the preconditions that make existing
institutional and social structures vulnerable to contentious politics.
In Skocpol\'s approach, for example, international competitive pressures
and pressures applied by a restive peasantry combine to weaken the state
and facilitate social revolution. The issue of why grievances arose
among peasants is not pertinent to the problem as she formulates it.
Approaches focused on resource mobilization and political opportunity
center on the processes through which a social movement is capable of
sustaining effective collective action within a given set of
institutional constraints. These efforts do not offer an answer to the
question of what structural conditions or individual motivations permit
the emergence of collective action. In other words, [[none of these
approaches is]{.mark} intended or [able to address the broader problem
of identifying]{.mark} where, whether, when, and [how grievances produce
transformations]{.mark} of the status quo]{.underline}. More recently,
[a number of [scholars have sought to]{.mark} build more integrated
frameworks intended to [bridge]{.mark} [different]{.mark} types of
[perspectives]{.mark} in order to generate a more comprehensive
understanding of social movements]{.underline}.Footnote62 [[This]{.mark}
move]{.underline} is not being driven by a desire for a synthetic grand
theory. It [[is being driven by a recognition of the multiplicity of
processes]{.mark}, at the structural and individual levels,
[that]{.mark} [need to come together]{.mark} in order for grievances to
be converted into protest behavior, and [for protest actions to]{.mark}
be aggregated into a social movement that can [carry out its
transformative agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}. Karl-Dieter Opp\'s
"structural-cognitive" approach, for example, reformulates various macro
approaches (e.g. stressing environmental conditions or political
opportunity structures) and micro approaches (e.g. stressing incentives
or cognitive framing) related to the process through which individual
protest actions emerge, coalesce into collective protest, and transform
the macro-structural conditions, including shifting opportunity
structures.Footnote63 In effect, the scope of the problem has been
widened to encompass more of the segments of the extended process
through which initial conditions conducive to protest give rise to a
transformation of the status quo. This does not suggest that the earlier
studies of social movements are inconsequential or incorrect. Far from
it. Precisely because these earlier studies yielded powerful insights
into particular aspects and processes related to social movements, it
makes sense to explore whether these insights can be integrated which,
in turn, requires broader problems that subsume the specific aspects or
processes targeted by existing traditions. Of course, a research
tradition may make assumptions and impose boundary conditions that make
sense for some types of questions but not for others. Indeed, the
competition among traditions is often as much about which questions are
more important as about the relative utility of particular concepts,
mechanisms, or methods. For example, neorealism trained its sights on
questions related to how the balance of power in a given setting affects
the likelihood of conflict or stability. It did not initially concern
itself with the main questions on which liberalism concentrated its
attention: the extent of economic interdependence and its effect on the
prospects for greater institutionalized cooperation among
self-interested state actors. At the same time, realist principles can
be reformulated in creative ways to shed light on how the distribution
of power affects states\' economic policies and the conduct of
international economic relations.Footnote64 Similarly, the trade and
conflict literature suggests that concepts and measures initially
developed within neoliberal institutionalism to capture interdependence
can be refined, reconstructed, and deployed to analyze the prospects of
conflict in the international arena.Footnote65 Thus, [[there need not be
a one-to-one correspondence between research traditions]{.mark} and the
analytic problems that initially inspired them]{.underline}. In fact,
[[these problems can be **reformulated and combined**]{.mark} insofar as
they are connected to a common substantive dilemma in the world of
policy and practice]{.underline}.

### AT Perm Fails -- "Exclusionary/Reinforces Dominant IR"

#### The perm won't reinforce dominant paradigms -- eclecticism opens up space for marginalized views

Rudra **Sil**, **2020**, International Journal: Canada's Journal of
Global Policy Analysis, "Analytic eclecticism - continuing the
conversation," 75(3):, mm

[One thread]{.underline} running through all of the essays [concerns the
extent to which the framing of analytic eclecticism]{.underline} in
Beyond Paradigms [ends up referencing the three dominant paradigms in
IR]{.underline}---the "triad" of realism, liberalism, and
constructivism. Chernoff wonders whether we adopt too much of a Kuhnian
view of paradigms in our treatment of empirical research in IR.
Blanchard builds on a number of previously published critiques to argue
that the benefit of eclecticism may be undercut by the emphasis on this
"triad" at the expense of attention to other, less wellrepresented
"isms" in the field. Similarly, Peet is troubled by the "exclusivity"
implied in showcasing combinatorial frameworks that draw from some---but
not other---research traditions. All three of these
[[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} in different ways [[wonder if the
specification of analytic eclecticism]{.mark} [in relation]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} the three [dominant paradigms]{.mark} effectively
[diminishes the space for legitimate criticism]{.mark}]{.underline}.
While [[the concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} raised by Chernoff, Blanchard,
and Peet are reasonable and deserve to be taken seriously, they [[are
hardly]{.mark} "[damaging]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the essence of [the
project]{.mark},"]{.underline} as Chernoff, Cornut, and James suggest in
their introduction, once the fundamental logic of analytic eclecticism
is distinguished from the tactical choices about how to efficiently
represent that logic in a book targeting the IR field. The more complex
and generalized form of our argument appeared in our 2010 article in
Perspectives on Politics, where [the main case for analytic
eclecticism]{.underline} [neither depends on fully formed
paradigms]{.underline}, [nor is limited to the field of International
Relations]{.underline}.2 Here, the problem is framed in terms of the
limitations on analyses imposed by any framework founded on a fixed
ontology and a fixed set of epistemological priors related to how best
to analyze the complexity of social life. Such commitments, whether or
not they evolve into defining features of two or three or however many
paradigms, presumably enable researchers to train their sights on
particular domains of social reality, particular levels of analysis, and
particular kinds of mechanisms or variables---but with the risk that
complex interactions and processes are overlooked.3 Thus, [[our]{.mark}
underlying [objective]{.mark} [was]{.mark} always [to]{.mark}
[create]{.mark} more [space for scholars]{.mark} who may reverse this
trade-off by eschewing the confining boundaries of any research
tradition and more freely exploring connections between different kinds
of social phenomena]{.underline}. In highlighting [the intellectual
payoffs of eclecticism]{.underline}, the exemplary works we referenced
[were drawn]{.underline} [not only from IR, but also such fields as
political economy, institutional theory, and social movement
theory]{.underline}.4 More generally, we were inspired by---and drew
liberally from---similar or complementary positions staked out in
different fields by such diverse scholars as Albert Hirschman, Scott
Page, and Philip Tetlock.5 In short, [[the core logic]{.mark} of
analytic eclecticism [was]{.mark} [never meant to be tethered to any one
discipline]{.mark}]{.underline}, [let alone any specific set of
paradigms.]{.underline} So, why, then, did we put so much stock in the
"triad" in the book? First, the book was intended to be useful in
advanced IR seminars still being organized around paradigms and
interparadigm debates featuring (neo)realism, (neo)liberalism, and
constructivism. Having laid out the more complex and generalized version
of the argument in the article, in Beyond Paradigms we opted to
foreground this familiar "triad" of dominant research traditions as an
efficient and streamlined way to convey the logic and payoffs of
eclecticism. In retrospect, perhaps [[we]{.underline} [should have
anticipated]{.underline}]{.mark}---and guarded against---[[the risk that
this]{.underline}]{.mark} move [[might be (mis)interpreted as
marginalizing alternative "isms]{.underline}]{.mark}."
[Yet]{.underline}, [[our intention was **precisely the**]{.mark}
**[opposite]{.mark}**]{.underline}: to diminish the influence of the
three big "isms" that we saw as disproportionately shaping research,
teaching, hiring, and promotion in IR---as reflected in the 2009 version
of the TRIP surveys.6 [By de-centering the theoretical priors of the
dominant paradigms, we hoped to create more space for not only eclectic
scholarship but any research that was not "protected]{.underline}" (in
Lakatosian terms) [by one of these paradigms]{.underline}. [This is why
[we specifically noted]{.mark}]{.underline} in the book [[that analytic
eclecticism need not be limited to combinatorial approaches drawing from
the "triad]{.mark}"]{.underline}: \[A\]nalytic eclecticism is
conceptualized in this book in relation to realism, liberalism, and
constructivism \... . In other countries, however, a number of other
paradigms enjoy equal or greater visibility in international relations
debates\... \[T\]he English school, feminism, post-modernism, and
Marxism all have a much broader following in Britain, Canada, and
Australia than in the United States. On the European continent,
hermeneutic and interpretive approaches are much more a part of the
'mainstream' than in the United States\...In such settings, although the
general logic of eclecticism still applies, what constitutes eclectic
research practice would have to be redefined.7 If we were to rewrite the
book now, we might adopt a different strategy for capturing the logic
and role of analytic eclecticism. The most recent TRIP surveys suggest
that fewer scholars design their research to conform to a single IR
paradigm than was the case a decade ago. And as Chernoff notes, even
those who work within a given research tradition, do so less because of
rigid adherence to foundational principles than because their empirical
questions focus attention on the kinds of variables analyzed in that
tradition. At the same time, whether or not a scholar conforms to an
established paradigm, the process of formulating a research problem and
designing a study can still involve (often unstated) metatheoretical
commitments that tend to a priori place disproportionate significance on
certain kinds of variables or mechanisms. Perhaps this broader point
became somewhat blurred when we opted to foreground the triad as much as
we did in the book, even if we did this for illustrative purposes. What
we hoped would stand the test of time is not our case for eclecticism
vis-a\`-vis any specific set of IR paradigms, but our broader rationale
for a more open-ended and inclusive field that does not a priori
stipulate what questions are most significant, what approaches are most
valuable, and what factors need to be prioritized in our analyses. Such
a stance is hardly inconsistent with the postures struck by Peet and
Blanchard, despite their discomfort with the attention we pay to the
"triad." [Looking ahead, [we would gladly integrate elements drawn from
less mainstream approaches]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Blanchard notes,
[such an approach would indeed extend the promise of a "theoretical
multilingualism" we had set out to promote]{.underline}. In this
context, we would not only be amenable to but welcome a more expansive
articulation of analytic eclecticism, including one incorporating an
intersectional perspective, as Peet forcefully proposes. Importantly,
[[we do not see such a move as necessitating a fundamental
reconceptualization of the core logic of analytic
eclecticism]{.underline}]{.mark}. It may, however, require a more
self-conscious effort to resist the temptation to either dismiss the
findings in paradigm-bound research or throw everything but the kitchen
sink at every imaginable puzzle.

### AT Perm Fails -- "Focus on Policy Relevance Bad"

#### Focusing on policy relevance does not trade off with critical analysis

Rudra **Sil, 2020**, International Journal: Canada's Journal of Global
Policy Analysis, "Analytic eclecticism - continuing the conversation,"
75(3):, mm

In gesturing toward pragmatism's emphasis on the consequences of
knowledge claims for action, [[we were also highlighting]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} potential [role of analytic eclecticism in bringing
scholarly research closer to the messiness of the real world]{.mark} [as
encountered by policy-makers]{.mark} [and other
actors]{.mark}]{.underline}. We felt that if [scholars were less
invested in]{.underline} recurrent [interparadigm debates]{.underline}
and less likely to speak past one another as a result of their
uncritical acceptance of certain theoretical priors, [then they might be
more open to puzzles that bore some resemblance to the messy choice
situations and practical dilemmas confronting real-world
actors]{.underline}. Importantly, [[we did not think of these actors as
limited to]{.mark} national or international [policy-makers, but also
ordinary individuals and communities]{.mark} contending with everyday
choice situations in the midst of the multitude of forces that
constituted their respective "lifeworlds]{.underline}." In retrospect, I
wonder whether this important nuance was not articulated clearly or
fully in our limited discussion of "policy relevance." In revisiting
this issue, [[I would wish to be more explicit about the link between
analytic eclecticism and]{.mark} three distinct [notions of "real-world"
relevance:]{.mark} [research]{.mark} that is policy [serving]{.mark} in
the sense that it offers prescriptions for [governmental
decision-makers]{.mark} pursuing set agendas; [research]{.mark} [that
seeks to]{.mark} intervene in policy debates and [re-examine
assumptions]{.mark} underlying a given policy position; [and research
that bears]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the everyday encounters and choices of
[ordinary actors as experienced in their respective
environments]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[[My preference would be
for eclectic scholars to liberally pursue the latter two forms of policy
relevance while being more cautious with respect to the
first]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Expanding the scope for dialogue between
academics and policy-makers is potentially a good thing, as is the need
to create more space for puzzles and arguments that reflect more of the
messy and complex challenges faced by actors in the real world. But, in
the process, [[scholars need not uncritically accept given policy
elites']{.mark}---or any actors'---[agendas and
assumptions]{.mark};]{.underline} nor should they hesitate to leverage
the distinctive skill sets and intellectual commitments that feed into
their choice of profession and areas of expertise. With further
elaboration of the above qualifications[, I believe it [is possible to
narrow the gap]{.mark}]{.underline} that Blanchard perceives
[[between]{.mark} [the deployment of analytic eclecticism to
address]{.mark} real-world problems and [policy debates and the position
of those who]{.mark}]{.underline}, like Anne Norton (cf. Blanchard),
[[are fearful of scholarly endeavours developed in the service of
agendas being pursued by those in power]{.mark}.]{.underline} But, does
ethics have a place in all this? It certainly should, according to
Blanchard's discussion of the role of critical scholars (whom he sees us
as having undervalued) and Peet's discussion of the centrality of "moral
responsibility" in the work of Jane Addams and feminist pragmatists.
[Others]{.underline}, too, [have questioned whether analytic eclecticism
is sufficiently attentive to normative forms of reasoning that are part
of international life]{.underline}.20 Looking back, I see that the term
"ethics" appears nowhere in either Beyond Paradigms or our article in
Perspectives on Politics. The term "normative" fares slightly better,
making a fleeting appearance in the introductory and concluding
chapters. In the conclusion, for example, [we note that analytic
eclecticism is,]{.underline} in part, [designed "to grapple with
problems that are not only theoretically interesting but also have
normative and practical significance for decision-makers and the wider
public]{.underline}."21

### AT Perm Fails -- "Footnoting/Incompatible Methods"

#### The permutation doesn't footnote the alternative -- eclecticism can find common ground among seemingly incompatible ideas 

Rudra **Sil** **and** Peter **Katzenstein**, **2010**, Perspectives on
Politics, "Analytic eclecticism in the study of world politics:
reconfiguring problems and mechanisms across research traditions," 8(2),
411-431,
https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/analytic-eclecticism-in-the-study-of-world-politics-reconfiguring-problems-and-mechanisms-across-research-traditions/B078D54DEFB199ADA653B7B35004EACF,
mm

Importantly, the accommodation of [[analytic eclecticism does not imply
the marginalization of scholarship]{.mark} embedded in research
traditions]{.underline}. The value added by analytic eclecticism depends
after all upon demonstrating how different sorts of findings and
mechanisms emerging from existing research practices can be
reconceptualized and integrated as elements of more complex explananda.
Analytic eclecticism\'s distinctive utility stems from its awareness of
the strengths and tradeoffs of the approaches employed by existing
traditions, and from its recognition of the particular intellectual
gains generated by these traditions in relation to substantive problems.
In fact, what keeps analytic eclecticism from devolving into a
perspective in which "everything matters" is the presumption that the
analyses produced within research traditions are valuable for the
purpose of identifying many of the factors that are likely to matter
most. The objective of analytic eclecticism is to uncover how these
factors matter in relation to specific research questions, not to
generate an ever-expanding list of all imaginable causal factors that
can influence world politics. Eclectic scholarship that is inattentive
to theories embedded in research traditions runs the risk of missing
important insights, reinventing the wheel, or producing analyses that
appear idiosyncratic or unintelligible to other scholars. The
distinctiveness of analytic eclecticism arises from its effort to
specify how elements of different causal stories might coexist as part
of a more complex argument that bears on problems of interest to both
scholars and practitioners. This requires engaging and utilizing, not
displacing, the well-organized research efforts undertaken by committed
adherents of various traditions. Of course, [[when drawing upon]{.mark}
theories or narratives]{.underline} developed [in [competing research
traditions, there is the danger of theoretical
incoherence]{.mark}]{.underline} linked to the problem of
incommensurability across traditions. The incommensurability thesis, as
articulated by Paul Feyerabend among others, argues that the concepts,
terms, and standards used in one theoretical approach, because they are
formulated on the basis of distinct assumptions about knowledge in the
context of distinct theoretical vocabularies, are not interchangeable
with those used in another theoretical approach.Footnote20 Thus, an
eclectic theory drawing upon research traditions founded on competing
ontological and epistemological principles can produce an artificial
homogenization of incompatible perspectives along with a host of
unrecognized conceptual problems that subvert the aims of the
theory.Footnote21 We recognize that much [care needs to be taken to
ensure]{.underline} that the relevant concepts, terms, and indicators
employed in different research traditions are properly understood and
translated before they are brought into [an integrated analytic
framework]{.underline}. The problem of incommensurability represents a
challenge, but there are two reasons we see this challenge as less
serious than assumed. First, as Donald Davidson, Hilary Putnam and
others have argued, [[there]{.underline}]{.mark} [[do]{.underline}
[exist possibilities for translation and
redefinition]{.underline}]{.mark}. Putnam employs the parallel to
languages to argue: "[if the thesis were really true]{.underline}, then
[we could not translate other languages]{.underline}---or even past
stages of our own language---[at all]{.underline}."Footnote22 In fact,
Feyerabend himself was primarily concerned with the idea of neutral
testing protocols that could be invoked to compare different types of
theories; he neither viewed incommensurability as implying
untranslatability nor assumed that translatability was a precondition
for theory comparison. Second, when social science theories embedded in
paradigms take on substantive research questions, they ultimately rely
on empirical referents to operationalize various concepts, variables,
and mechanisms. [[This provides one avenue through which]{.mark}
specific elements of [a causal story within one research tradition can
be juxtaposed, reconceptualized, and possibly combined with elements of
a causal story in a different tradition]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[It [is also possible to break down competing]{.mark} explanatory
[logics]{.mark} [into]{.mark} elemental [segments]{.mark} [in such a way
that they become "abstractly compatible]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[such
that we could imagine a world in which all were operating while we
debate how much variants of each contributed to any given
action]{.underline}]{.mark}."Footnote23 This implies that [it may be
possible to temporarily separate metatheoretical postulates from
specific substantive claims or interpretations so as to enable direct
comparison between, and greater integration across, the entire range of
causal stories that aim to address similar or related empirical
phenomena]{.underline}.Footnote24 In any case, the challenge of
establishing equivalence among concepts and mechanisms across research
traditions is only somewhat greater than that of doing so across diverse
strands of research traditions, once we consider that many of the key
metaphysical divides in the social sciences---for example, between
objectivism/subjectivism; nominalism/realism; materialism/idealism; or
agency/structure---have proven to be "fractal distinctions,"Footnote25
structuring narrower debates within competing traditions. The challenge
may be greater when traveling across traditions, but it is not
insurmountable if proper care is taken to consider the premises upon
which specific analytic components are operationalized in relation to
the empirical world.

### AT Perm Fails -- "Incompatible Methods"

#### Prefer pluralism -- incorporating multiple theories of IR is complementary rather than conflictual

David **Lake**, June **2011**, "Why 'isms' are evil: theory,
epistemology, and academic sects as impediments to understanding and
progress," International Studies Quarterly, 55(2), 465-480,
https://www.jstor.org/stable/23019696?seq=1, mm

[[Our duty as scholars is to]{.mark} enhance understanding of the
world]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, if possible, to
[[identify]{.underline}]{.mark} [[levers]{.mark}
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} when manipulated [can
[facilitate]{.mark}]{.underline} [[progress]{.underline}]{.mark}
[toward]{.underline} more humane and normatively [desirable
ends]{.underline}. Society privileges us as [academics]{.underline} with
a relatively prosperous and certainly desirable lifestyle so that we can
add to the stock of human knowledge and, hopefully, provide some insight
into how to improve social life. Most important, society---or at least,
Western society entrusts us with the power to organize our professional
lives and our academic inquiries in any way that we, as scholars, think
appropriate. We are a genuinely self-regulating profession both in what
constitutes knowledge and in how we define and create incentives for
professional success. In this essay, I probe some tensions between our
professional practices in the field of international studies and the
quality of our professional output. We are not giving society what it
deserves, not only in terms of policy-relevant research where the \"the
gap\" is of long-standing (George 1993). [[We]{.underline} [are not
giving society]{.underline} [what it deserves]{.underline}]{.mark} [even
in terms of basic theoretical and empirical knowledge]{.underline}
[about world politics,]{.underline} a domain that we as
[[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} claim as our own. My critique of our
profession is a common one, but one worth repeating. Most generally, we
[[organize]{.underline}]{.mark} ourselves [[into]{.mark} academic
\"[sects]{.mark}\" [that]{.mark} engage in self-affirm-ing research and
then [wage]{.mark} theological [debates between academic
religions]{.mark}.]{.underline} This occurs at both the level of theory
and epistemology. In turn, we reward those who stake out extreme
positions within each sect. Unfortunately, [[this]{.underline}]{.mark}
[academic sectarianism]{.underline}, a product of our own internal
political struggles, [[produces less understanding]{.mark} rather than
more]{.underline}. Some reasonably fear intellectual \"monocul-tures,\"
as McNamara (2009) has called the possible hegemony of rationalism. But
the current cacophony is not a sign of productive intellectual ferment
in the pursuit of meaningful knowledge.2 Rather, we have produced a
clash of compet-ing theologies each claiming its own explanatory
\"miracles\" and asserting its universal truth and virtue. Instead**[, a
large measure of [intellectual humility is in
order]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Theoretically, [[we are far from the holy
grail of a universal theory of international
politics]{.underline}]{.mark}---[if]{.underline} indeed [such a grail
even exists]{.underline}. [[We should focus]{.underline}]{.mark} instead
[[on developing contin-gent]{.underline}, [mid-level theories of
specific phenomena]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This]{.underline} analytical
eclecticism [is likely to be more productive]{.underline} (Sil and
Katzenstein 2010). But we also need a lexi-con for translating otherwise
incommensurable theories and making them mutu-ally intelligible. In the
following section, I outline the problems with theoretical sects and
affirm the case for analytic eclecticism. I then end with one possible
\"Rosetta stone\" that aims to facilitate conversation across research
traditions by suggesting that all theories of international studies can
be disaggregated into the basic and common concepts of interests,
interactions, and institutions. Epistemologically, there is perhaps an
even deeper divide that is, unfortu-nately, not so easily bridged. The
nomothetic vs narrative divide cuts through all of the social sciences
and possibly beyond. [This divide endures because
scholars]{.underline}---either innately or through socialization---[find
one form of explanation more intellectually satisfying than the
other.]{.underline} Yet, in international studies, we have reified this
divide and, as with our theories, have formed mutually exclusive
churches. [[Rather than claiming one or the other epistemology is always
and everywhere superior, we should recognize that both are valid and
perhaps **even complementary paths to
understanding**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The question is not which approach
is inherently superior, but which yields greater insights under what
circumstances. The second major section below takes up epistemology and
its consequences for professional practice and knowledge.

#### Ontological and epistemological differences to not preclude the permutation -- the alternative can still be combined with the plan without coopting their scholarship 

P. **Katzenstein** **and** Rudra **Sil**, **2008**, Oxford Handbook of
International Relations, "Eclectic Theorizing in the Study and Practice
of International Relations,"
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287914880_Eclectic_Theorizing_in_the_Study_and_Practice_of_International_Relations,
mm

It is true that [[moving between research traditions]{.underline}
[founded]{.underline} [on competing]{.underline}]{.mark} [**ontological
and epistemological** [principles]{.mark} [runs]{.mark} [some]{.mark}
[risk of]{.mark} introducing [conceptual fuzziness]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Johnson 2002). [[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Ted Hopf
(forthcoming) notes, [the analytic [foundations]{.mark} of a given
tradition]{.underline} may not be as far apart as is often assumed, and
these foundations [[can be adjusted]{.mark} or bracketed [so as to
enable]{.mark} the translation]{.underline}, [comparison, and
[integration]{.mark} of substantive theories and narratives developed in
different research traditions]{.underline}. So long as there is clarity
with regard to concepts and definitions, [[differences in
metatheoretical postulates **do not inherently preclude**]{.mark}
**recognition of complementarities and [linkages]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
substantive processes in [international
life]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} even if these are normally
represented in distinct theoretical vocabularies and cast at different
levels of analysis (Sil 2000a; 2004; Katzenstein and Sil 2004; Parsons
2007). Eclectic approaches cannot ignore or substitute for the
intellectual products generated within separate traditions. However,
[[by expanding]{.mark} the]{.underline} repertoire of
[[assumptions]{.mark}, analytic tools, theoretical concepts,
methodological devices, and empirical data, [analytic eclecticism allows
for the development of complex explanations that reveal how different
kinds of causal mechanisms and processes might relate to each
other]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### AT Perm Fails -- "Pragmatism Bad"

#### The perm's deployment of pragmatism is neither rigid nor fixed -- it is simply a starting point for analyzing competing theories 

Rudra **Sil, 2020**, International Journal: Canada's Journal of Global
Policy Analysis, "Analytic eclecticism - continuing the conversation,"
75(3):, mm

Yet, what some see as a dismissive posture with respect to metatheory is
actually a metatheoretical proposition: that rigid adherence to
foundational positions can become---in Hirschman's words---"a hindrance
to understanding."13 [[What we reject is not metatheory but]{.mark} the
tight coupling of theoretical arguments with a [fixed set of
foundational principles]{.mark} [that]{.mark} might [preclude]{.mark} a
more expansive]{.underline}, [openended [exploration]{.mark} of the
interconnectedness of different social forces, essentially turning the
incommensurability thesis into a self-fulfilling prophesy]{.underline}.
[This is why [we propose only the temporary bracketing of]{.mark} select
[metatheoretical]{.mark} [postulates]{.mark} [as a way to illuminate new
analytic possibilities]{.mark} that might be otherwise dismissed out of
hand on the basis of fixed epistemological commitments]{.underline}.14
We see a fruitful eclectic scholarship as not ignoring metatheory but
engaging with it in a creative and flexible manner. In fact, a search
for the term "metatheory" in Beyond Paradigms yields no fewer than
thirty references. Moreover, many of these appear in passages explicitly
noting that useful eclectic theorizing requires careful consideration of
metatheory! We argue in our introduction to the book: increased
receptiveness to non-paradigmatic scholarship makes it all the more
necessary to think carefully and systematically about what kinds of
metatheoretical reformulations and research strategies are most likely
to produce useful, coherent eclectic alternatives to theories put
forward by the established paradigms.15 Having said that, [we do
understand]{.underline} and even share Chernoff's worry [that a
discipline overrun by eclecticists might]{.underline} eventually come to
[totally ignore metatheory]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline} precisely
why, in the conclusion of the book, [we remind readers that
"[eclecticism offers a pragmatic way of]{.mark} getting on with the work
of [understanding the world, but]{.mark} also [requires us to
reflect]{.mark} back [on]{.mark} existing theoretical perspectives and
[metatheoretical foundations]{.mark}]{.underline}."16 Our concern for
metatheory is also evident in the pains we take to establish a
connection between analytic eclecticism and pragmatism---another move
that some have raised concerns about. Let me first note that we are
neither interested in offering an authoritative reformulation of
pragmatism, nor suggesting that eclectic scholarship is the only or best
way to translate pragmatist principles into a comprehensive research
strategy in IR. [We embrace [pragmatism]{.mark}]{.underline} precisely
[because it [offers]{.mark} a set of [philosophical positions
that]{.mark} [allows for a]{.mark} flexible yet recognizable common
[platform for launching different kinds of eclectic analyses on a wide
range of questions]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Pragmatism]{.mark} represents
a comfortable stance that [engages]{.mark} a number of [important
metatheoretical]{.mark} issues but [without rigid adherence]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} the kinds of [foundational postulates]{.mark} upon which
established research traditions have been constructed]{.underline}.17 Of
course, pragmatist philosophy encompasses a great many principles, not
all of which sit comfortably with analytic eclecticism. Peet worries
that the pragmatist ideal of a "universal common category" tends to
encourage a push for consensus that undercuts the pluralistic impulse of
eclectic scholarship. [It is worth noting that we [make no mention of a
"universal common category"]{.mark} among the pragmatist
ideals]{.underline} we link to analytic eclecticism. Indeed, even if
this ideal holds some significance in the abstract for pragmatism writ
large, it is often assigned less weight relative to other features of
pragmatism. [[Our]{.mark} conceptualization of [analytic
eclecticism]{.mark}]{.underline}, which we emphatically distinguish from
the construction of a universal synthetic approach, [[puts more stock
in]{.mark} what pragmatism has to say about]{.underline} fallibilism,
dialogue, and [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} experimental
[[redeployment]{.mark} [of]{.mark} pieces of [knowledge in light of new
experiences]{.mark} and changing situations]{.underline}.18 To the
extent that any program of action requires some prior consensus, [[we
stress the need for]{.mark} an [inclusive]{.mark} process of
negotiating]{.underline} this [[consensus]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Moreover, drawing upon fallibilism, we see any consensus as little more
than a tentative, fleeting agreement to permit resolution of a specific
problem at a particular time and place. This move hardly necessitates
what Peet calls a "static view of categories," and it certainly does not
preclude critical discussion and reassessment in light of evolving
conditions and alternative knowledge claims.

## Neg -- AT Analytic Eclecticism

### Perm Fails -- Reinforces Dominant Theories of IR

#### The perm fails -- it is not an authentic attempt at analytic eclecticism. The attempt to tack our alternative onto the plan reinforces dominant discourses in IR

Eric **Blanchard**, **2020**, International Journal: Canada's Journal of
Global Policy Analysis, "Combing the same beach: analytic eclecticism
and the challenge of theoretical multilingualism ," 75(3): 404-419, mm

[[If analytic eclecticism is to]{.underline}]{.mark} successfully
[[engage post-positivist research, it must]{.underline}]{.mark} continue
to [[engage in debates over "reflexivity]{.underline},"]{.mark} debates
which have been mostly confined to the field's dissident periphery. [But
to do so, [it will have to]{.mark} more fully [engage the "double
hermeneutic]{.mark}]{.underline}," which denotes the
"slippage"---between the meaningful frames of lay actors on the one hand
and the metalanguages of social scientists on the other---that a
researcher will encounter while practising social science.47 [[Meaning
is imposed]{.mark} doubly, [by the objects of
research]{.mark}]{.underline} upon the relevant events situated in their
own context [[and by the researchers]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is
challenging to forms of triad scholarship modelled on natural sciences,
which, being concerned with unreflective physical objects and a world
that "does not answer back," need neither take into account the
self-interpretations of the people being studied nor weigh the
researchers' self-interpretations, as do the social sciences.
[Eclecticism will]{.underline} also [have to navigate]{.underline}
myriad conceptions of "[reflexivity]{.underline}" and, as Michael Lynch
suggests, there is "a confusing array of reflexivities" but "no single
way to be, or not to be, reflexive."48 In IR, reflexivity has been
deployed to signal the self-conscious situating of a researcher in their
research, attending to the premises of one's process of theorizing and
researching (including one's cultural-political prejudices), the
submission of favoured theories to contextualization and historical
reflection, and recognition of how analytic and data-gathering choices
condition the data produced, among other definitions.49 Though variously
conceived, reflexivity is a key value commitment of non-triad research
traditions in IR. Constructivists Audie Klotz and Cecelia Lynch urge
that scholars recognize the inevitability of "bias," yet "strive to be
self-aware, in order to understand the moral and methodological
implications of our choices."50 Patrick Thaddeus Jackson argues that
[the recognition that]{.underline} [methodology is "complicit in the
production and reproduction of the world]{.underline}" [commits the
scholar]{.underline} who wants to research this world [to]{.underline}
reflexivity, "[an awareness of how the habits and experiences that one
is bringing to bear on a situation shape and construct that
situation.]{.underline}"51 [Feminist IR theory offers perhaps the most
sustained reflection on reflexivity and IR research]{.underline}. For
example, Ackerly, Stern, and True place reflexivity, which they define
as the continual re-interrogation of one's own scholarship, at the core
of the feminist approach to methodology.52 Following the work of Sandra
Harding and others, Ann Tickner describes feminist reflexivity as a
posture that recasts the relationship between researcher and subject,
attends to related power disparities, and resists the assumption of
scholarly detachment.53 Thus, [[eclecticists]{.underline}
[must]{.underline}]{.mark} be willing not only to countenance a broad
rejection of the belief in any transcendent, universally valid
knowledge,54 but also to [[open their own scholarly practices up to
scrutiny and consider their own normative
influences]{.underline}.]{.mark} As Cai Wilkinson observes, [[since
reflexivity cannot "**be retrospectively bolted on to our
research**]{.underline}" [analytic eclectics can start from an "explicit
articulation of how the research was actually done, why and with what
effects for the resulting interpretation that is
presented]{.underline}]{.mark}."55 Reflexivity may prompt a variety of
reappraisals regarding the ways scholars are bound up in the production
of knowledge about climate change. Directed at institutions, reflexive
attitudes may inspire us to inquire into the funding sources of the
modern university system, colonized as it is by corporate sponsorship of
academic institutions and foundations funded by energy extractive
industries with a pronounced "interest in staving off any government
action on climate change and weakening environmental safeguards."56
Individual-level approaches to scholarly reflexivity are diverse and
defy summary, but Heather A. Smith's work is illustrative. Writing in a
post-positivist feminist vein, Smith presents Indigenous voices and ways
of knowing, which, she argues, disrupt the "global" discourse of climate
change in a way so as not to colonize or exoticize their discourse while
at the same time flagging the contested and political nature of the term
"Indigenous." Smith further emphasizes how [[un-reflexive scholarly
practices can reinforce dominant discourses]{.underline},]{.mark} seen
for example in discussions of climate inequality that ignore Indigenous
peoples from the global North.57

### Perm Fails -- Pragmatism Bad

#### The pragmatic nature of the permutation renders power relations invisible which reinforces the dominant norms of IR

Jessica **Peet**, **2020**, International Journal: Canada's Journal of
Global Policy Analysis, "Eclecticism or exclusivity? The (critical)
pragmatist ethos of (intersectional) analytic eclecticism," 75(3):
420-432, mm

Analytic eclecticism holds significant promise for IR. However,
[as]{.underline} it is [currently]{.underline} [conceptualized,
[analytic eclecticism falls short of resulting in eclectic
research]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Instead, [it has the opposite effect,
reinforcing the hold of mainstream paradigms on the
field]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why does analytic eclecticism fall short of
its emancipatory promise? In this article, I trace this contradictory
effect to the pragmatist ethos underlying analytic eclecticism.
[[The]{.mark} internal [contradiction begins with]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[pragmatist tenets]{.underline}]{.mark} Sil and Katzenstein lay
out. [[These tenets]{.mark} [rely on a]{.mark} [popular---but
uncritical]{.mark}---[understanding of pragmatism]{.mark}, one [that
fails to account for power]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}15 [[This
foundation is especially problematic as it makes invisible the
disciplinary power dynamics which reify and are reified in the
privileging of the dominant theoretical triad in]{.underline}
[IR]{.underline}.]{.mark}16 Given this contradictory outcome, can
analytic eclecticism's promise of liberating scholarship from
paradigmatic boundaries still be achieved? Perhaps, but not without a
critical ethos.

### Perm Fails - Ethics DA / Policing DA

#### Their permutation can't capture the ethical orientation of the alternative -- their method's insistence on "policy relevance" is an act of disciplinary policing

Eric **Blanchard**, **2020**, International Journal: Canada's Journal of
Global Policy Analysis, "Combing the same beach: analytic eclecticism
and the challenge of theoretical multilingualism ," 75(3): 404-419, mm

Christian Reus-Smit has argued that [[Sil and

"empirical-theoretic [[project]{.underline}" [is]{.underline}
]{.mark}[not equipped to deal with normative reflection and thus
[unable]{.mark} [to]{.mark} produce the kind of practical knowledge that

[This]{.underline} lack of "systematic reflection on values,"72
according to Reus-Smit, [hobbles]{.underline} [analytic eclecticism's
efforts to produce policy-relevant knowledge]{.underline} as it intends,
in the spirit of Aristotelian phronesis. Relatedly, [an avowed concern
with ethics is never far from the top of the intellectual priority list
of many non-triad scholars]{.underline}. For instance, [feminist IR
approaches to research methods place ethics among epistemology,
ontology, and choice of method as primary elements of a definition of
methodology]{.underline}.73 Constructivists Klotz and Lynch recognize
what they see as the unavoidable ethical dimension of constructivist
scholarship, though they warn "against translating ethical assumptions
into particular tools of analysis" and against granting any particular
method the "moral high ground."74 Ethical motivations are certainly not
the monopoly of [[critical scholars]{.underline}]{.mark}, but this
community [[tends to foreground ethical concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} in
its publications [more prominently than realist, liberal, and
causal-oriented constructivists.]{.underline} [[Sil and Katzenstein's
discussion of ethics]{.underline}]{.mark} (in their review of the work
of Hoffmann and Finnemore) [[is scattered]{.underline}]{.mark}, lacks
focus, and could be enriched through dialogue with non-triad
approaches.75 [This is not to say it will be easy to surface ethics in
the eclectic analytic heuristic]{.underline}. The urgency of climate
change clearly raises enormous ethical issues: intergenerational
responsibilities, the morality of population growth, the commitment to
exuberant consumption and carbon-intensive transportation practices, and
obligations to (distant) humans and non-human life, to name a few.
Generally, the commitments of the dominant paradigms of IR, with their
group-centric power politics and free-trade-centred pursuit of progress,
sit uneasily with the range of anthropocentric and ecocentric approaches
to environmental ethics. Burke et al. suggest we develop an ethics of
climate change, one worthy of the unprecedented challenge, one that goes
beyond "visions of the good life" to address "the goodness of life
itself."76 At a more modest scale, ethical approaches to climate change
scholarship align with reflexive postures that acknowledge and
foreground researcher positionality and entail giving respectful voice
to marginalized peoples and impacted positions. [[Given the demand for
ethics]{.mark}]{.underline} in a chaotic present and uncertain future,
[[non-triad approaches are arguably better placed to
cultivate]{.mark}]{.underline} the necessary [[ethical
imagination]{.underline}]{.mark} or identify the constitution of nascent
planetary identities, but they certainly complicate the picture we have
of climate change beyond states and markets, geopolitics, and public
goods, making the boundaries of policy relevancy particularly salient.
[[Critical and post-positivist scholars might naturally be suspicious of
the eclectic project]{.underline},]{.mark} directed at climate change or
as a general program, [[if it seems to reify existing power-laden
disciplinary structures **by policing the borders of legitimate
scholarship**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This]{.mark} particular emphasis
on power [relates to a]{.mark} possible post-positivist [concern with
the eclectic impulse toward policy relevance]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Recall Sil and Katzenstein's argument that the value-added of
eclecticism involves relating research to ordinary actors and
policy-makers. [Sil and Katzenstein suspect the "compartmentalization of
knowledge" prohibits the beneficial sharing of insights that address
real-world dilemmas]{.underline}. [Yet [a move toward policy relevance
as a criterion for research may strike many]{.mark} who self-identify
outside of the mainstream [as]{.mark} political and even
[disciplining]{.mark}]{.underline}. Steve Smith argues that [[when "one
party announces that approaches have to be policy relevant, \[it is\]
usually defined as relevant for activities of the state]{.underline}.
[Dismissing work as being irrelevant to policy choices is a powerful
disciplining device]{.underline}]{.mark}."77 This issue evokes further
discussion of the ethics of useful knowledge, of its "relevance" (to the
state? to ordinary or marginal people? to whom?) and intelligibility.
From Sil and Katzenstein's text, it seems eclecticism emphasizes an
appeal to policy-makers more than "ordinary actors," but this need not
be the case. Feminist IR scholars, for example, can argue that their
theories and scholarship, developed in close consultation and
interaction with real-world activists, policy-makers, and ordinary
women, does not "sit on the sidelines" and suffers no such relevance
deficit (witness titanic efforts to theorize "gender mainstreaming" in
global governance, attention to rape in warfare and other forms of
sexual violence, and projects to enable women by making them
"productive" in the global economy).

### Perm Fails -- Exclusion DA

#### Exclusion DA -- Consensus is not always possible - forcing the alternative to coexist with the plan fosters inclusionary violence and inevitably excludes the voices of the oppressed

Jessica **Peet, 2020,** International Journal: Canada's Journal of
Global Policy Analysis, "Eclecticism or exclusivity? The (critical)
pragmatist ethos of (intersectional) analytic eclecticism," 75(3):
420-432, mm

At first glance, pragmatism seems to provide an appropriate foundation
for analytic eclecticism. Pragmatism's investment in consensus combined
with its recognition that knowledge is discursive and social---and thus
open to reformulation---provides an alternative perspective to IR's
tendencies to understand knowledge as either the product of objective
rationalism or subjective interpretivism. Where specific theoretical
paradigms choose one approach or the other, pragmatism advocates the
utility of both derivations. Thus, in theory, a pragmatist ethos allows
eclectic research to sidestep metatheoretical debates and the challenges
inherent in combining opposing perspectives.18 In practice, [by not
acknowledging the power dynamics which shape these controversies in
disciplinary IR]{.underline},19 [[a pragmatist ethos can have the effect
of (re)producing the status quo]{.underline},]{.mark} privileging
rationalism, positivism, and the dominant theoretical triad. [This
inattention to power]{.underline}, [generally, and the disciplinary
power dynamics of epistemological difference, specifically, can be
linked to pragmatism's investment in universalism]{.underline}.
Universalism, or the belief in a common category or position salient
across theoretical traditions, enables multiple perspectives to be
combined without fear of incommensurability, an issue that Fred Chernoff
addresses in more detail in his contribution to this forum.20 Yet, [by
assuming that a universal category exists, [pragmatism]{.mark} actually
[simplifies complex issues]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [this focus
on a universal category privileges that category as most important,
marginalizing the relevance of other categories along with their
potential explanatory power.]{.underline} [This marginalization directly
counters analytic eclecticism's goal of attending to complexity and
bringing diverse approaches to the forefront]{.underline}. [This
investment in universalism also brings about a static view of
categories]{.underline}. Universal categories are identified by their
similarities, which are fixed and unchanging across time and theoretical
tradition. Sil and Katzenstein identify the substantive referent (i.e.,
the research problem) to be the universal category, arguing that the
research problem is not dependent on the theoretical approach(es) being
employed. However, to identify a common category among different
approaches, it must be determined a priori what similarities are to be
contained within that category. Thus, [for any determination to be made,
artificial boundaries must be imposed upon the referent so that it can
be identified]{.underline}. [But imposing constructed boundaries upon
the referent works to simplify the problem, which again contravenes the
goals of analytic eclecticism]{.underline}. [[Pragmatism]{.mark} also
provides a questionable foundation for analytic eclecticism because it
[tends to privilege consensus over difference]{.mark}]{.underline}.21
[[Achieving consensus renders dynamic and complex interactions among and
within categories invisible]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This]{.mark} both
[undermines the spirit of eclecticism]{.mark} and ignores the wider
power dynamics that shape the field]{.underline}. **[[Consensus is not
always possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Sometimes commonality cannot
be found because no universal category or position exists, and forcing
commonality **can breed violences of inclusion**]{.underline}]{.mark}.22
Gayatri Spivak famously argues that [[the subaltern is rendered
mute]{.underline}]{.mark} (and therefore can neither speak nor be heard)
[[because of the complexities of finding consensus between the position
of the subaltern and that of the oppressor]{.underline}]{.mark}.23
Achille Mbembe argues that [t[he illusion of consensus across wide power
differentials is only possible in conditions of extreme violence
perpetrated on those at the lower end of those
differentials]{.mark}]{.underline}.24 Taken together, these problems
show how [[eclectic theorizing functions to
exclude]{.underline}]{.mark}. Investment in consensus and universality
inhibits the visibility of (disciplinary) power dynamics, even though
they are central to shaping what is considered universal and who is
considered part of any consensus produced by analytic eclecticism. When
conceptualized with this kind of ethos, [[analytic eclecticism will
always have exclusive effects because it lacks the tools to recognize or
correct its own exclusivity]{.underline}]{.mark}. To achieve
inclusivity, these foundations must be challenged.

### Perm Fails -- Footnoting DA

#### Footnoting DA -- the perm fails since it only emphasizes dominant IR, rendering the alt ineffective

Eric **Blanchard, 2020,** International Journal: Canada's Journal of
Global Policy Analysis, "Combing the same beach: analytic eclecticism
and the challenge of theoretical multilingualism ," 75(3): 404-419, mm

[The promise of [eclecticism]{.mark}]{.underline} as a facilitator of
scholarly communication, however, [[is limited]{.mark} [by]{.mark} Sil
and Katzenstein's decision to limit [its scope to realism, liberalism,
and constructivism without giving]{.mark} sustained
[consideration]{.mark} [to the wide range of potentially eclectic
approaches to world politics]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The authors
justify limiting the purview of their pluralist project to the triad by
arguing these represent the "most prevalent approaches in the United
States and worldwide."35 However, as Cornut has noted, [[this choice
opens Sil and Katzenstein to charges "of using]{.underline}]{.mark}
problem-driven [[pragmatism to appear more pluralist **while creating
strict disciplinarian boundaries that render challenges to the
mainstream illegitimate**]{.underline}]{.mark}."36 Since a partial
pluralism is ultimately self-defeating, it makes sense to promote Sil
and Katzenstein's stated efforts to produce a "greater scope for
deliberation among a more inclusive community of inquirers"37 by
involving as many outsiders as possible who roughly fit the three main
commitments (noted above). [[Limiting the relevant paradigms]{.mark} to
those currently dominant also [misses an opportunity to interact with a
set of interlocutors ignored in the original formulation of
eclecticism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ten years after the publication of
Beyond Paradigms, eclecticism has the opportunity to live up to its
communicative promise by engaging the products of a maturing
methodological turn in critical approaches to IR and Political Science.
There are a number of excellent works addressing research design,
argument, and metatheory in IR and Political Science that include
consideration of non-triad approaches within the framework of philosophy
of social science.38 In addition, [[there exists]{.underline}]{.mark} a
first generation of [[high-quality]{.underline}]{.mark} methodological
primers on what it means to engage in the practice of [[critical
research produced by authors working under the banners of
interpretivism, constructivism, feminism, post-structuralism, and
political theory]{.underline}]{.mark}.39 This literature is remarkable
in that it emanates from traditions that had long resisted the
imperatives of systematization, methodologism, and scientism,
recognizing the negative effects that adherence to standardized cannons
or procedures can have on scholarship.40
