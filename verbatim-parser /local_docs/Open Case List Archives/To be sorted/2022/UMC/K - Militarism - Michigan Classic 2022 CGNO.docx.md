#### [NATO's rhetoric of a dangerous Russia creates a security feedback loop of military modernization and unintended consequences leading to conflict]{.underline}

Julie **Wilhelmsen**, 9-30-20**20**, \"Spiraling toward a New Cold War
in the North? The Effect of Mutual and Multifaceted Securitization,\"

For example, a [[**securitization of NATO** as]{.mark} different and
[dangerous **to Russia** **creates**]{.mark} both inner cohesion in the
Russian polity and makes possible a **[policy of "military
modernization" and]{.mark} a [posture of "defensive]{.mark}
[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}," but it **[[can have unintended
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It can be taken as a rejection of
NATO\'s self-constituted identity as a legitimate, reliable,
security-seeking actor and [elicit a string of representations of Russia
as different and dangerous on the NATO side.]{.underline}8 Failure to be
recognized by the other on one\'s own preferred terms might not
necessarily result in feelings of inferiority and shame, triggering
efforts to reconstruct one\'s own identity, as Bially Mattern has
suggested (2004, 12--13) or "progressive change" of self to become like
the other, as Ringmar (2014) holds. As Lupovici (2012, 818) notes a
collective [actor that experiences ontological threat]{.underline} [can
"redefine the situation in order to protect identity]{.underline}."
"Avoidance," he says, building on Giddens (1991, 188) "allows an actor
facing an ontological dissonance to revalidate its identity rather than
to change it or to change its behaviour." Lupovici explores the strategy
of avoidance in situations where dissonance is created endogenously,
between conflicting self-identifications and the responses undertaken to
offset threats to these self-identifications within one political
entity. Avoidance may play out differently when the ontological
dissonance emerges exogenously in a dyad of political entities. To
reduce the dissonance between the understanding of self and the explicit
identification of one\'s own political entity by the other as being
something different and dangerous, revalidation of own identity can be
achieved through externalization, by simply returning the negative
identification. This strategy is manifest as a clear pattern in the
texts by Norwegian/Western and Russian leaders studied below. It is
hardly surprising that a collective actor would respond to the
non-recognition implicit in being securitized with externalization in
the form of talking and hitting back instead of undertaking some form of
internal revision. [[Responding by mirroring]{.mark} the
[securitization]{.mark} of your group by the other party can be
[rewarding in terms of delineating and]{.mark} [maintaining
self-identity]{.mark}, particularly [in]{.mark} a [time of
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. To restate and return to the case in focus:
the [[non-recognition implicit in Russia\'s securitization of NATO **can
elicit highly antagonistic representations of Russia from**]{.mark}
**the [NATO side]{.mark}, [triggering]{.mark} another round of
[rep]{.mark}re[s]{.mark}entations and [accusations]{.mark} from the
Russian side, [and so on]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Such a [negative spiral
of mutual representations and accusations can be driven
further]{.underline} [when the different non-military issue-areas in
which collective political entities engage also become subject to
securitization.]{.underline} While relations between such entities
usually take place on different international arenas addressing
different issue-areas and exhibit a mixed pattern of friendly and
hostile interaction (Jervis 2001, 37; Bially Mattern 2004), they may
become subject to patterned all-encompassing friendly or **[[hostile
interaction]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The latter, I propose, can
**[[happen]{.underline}]{.mark}** when security concerns take
center-stage in relations, **[[through]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
**[[spillover from]{.mark} [mutual securitization in]{.mark} the
[military]{.mark} sphere [into]{.mark} other arenas of potentially
neutral or friendly [interaction, such as trade]{.mark},
[culture]{.mark}, or even [diplomacy]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### The 1AC's language perpetuates and normalizes militarism as a cultural system 

**Gusterson and Besteman 19** (Hugh, Professor in the Department of
Anthropology and Elliott School of International Affairs of George

Anthropology of Colby College, "Cultures of Militarism: An Introduction
to Supplement 19", February 2019, "Current Anthropology Volume 60,
Supplement 19") // Ilake LT🐣

In contrast, [anthropologists' [interest in militarism]{.mark} has
[taken shape in]{.mark} the [context of]{.mark} post--cold war
transformations in the [management of violence]{.mark}]{.underline}.
These years have seen the violent reorganization of some cold war client
states; the proliferation of militia-led insurgencies; the
interpenetration of organized crime and drug trafficking with insurgency
and counter in-surgency in parts of the global south; the articulation
of coun-ter insurgency abroad with domestic policing at home in many
Western countries; the reformulation of the [[U]{.mark}nited
[N]{.mark}ations into [an institution of militarized peacekeeping and
occupation]{.mark}]{.underline}; the [increasing [use of
military]{.mark} labor [to perform civil, humanitarian, policing, and
development]{.mark} [activities]{.mark}; and a [growing
awareness]{.mark} of the ways [in which militarism as]{.mark} a set of
cultural practices and [ideologies]{.mark} **[pervades all domains of
social]{.mark} life**. The [anthropologists]{.mark} in this volume [see
**militarism as a cultural system**]{.mark}]{.underline}; [it is shaped
through ideology and rhetoric, effected through bodies and technologies,
made visible and invisible through campaigns of imagery and knowledge
production, and it **[colonizes aspects of social life including
reproduction, self-image, and notions of
community]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We interrogate militarism in its
established and emergent forms, probing its genealogies, its facility at
colonizing daily life, and its ability to present itself as a response
to insecurities it has itself provoked.4This collection of papers draws
on the rich discussions at the symposium from which this volume emerged
to capture some of the distinctive features of cultures of militarism.
The papers emphasize militarization as a contingent process over
militarism as a measurable object;5decenter the state as the core locus
of such processes; probe the relationship between militarism,
experience, and identity, with a special focus on the body; examine
connections between militarism and social injustice; and evince a
commitment to critique and under-mine militarism while, at the same
time, respecting the force of its appeal. The New Anthropology of
Militarism: Four Features Threat Constructions These papers understand
[[militarism as]{.mark} a [process rather than as]{.mark} a
[bounded]{.mark}, measurable [thing enmeshed in deterministic
relationships with other]{.mark} reified
[variables]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Militarism as]{.mark} an in-flective
[force]{.mark} or bundle of processes acts upon society in pow-erful and
expansive but uneven and contingent ways]{.underline}. Although
[[militarism carves]{.mark} its [way deep into social
structures]{.mark}, it is [also shaped and reshaped in the dialectical
interaction]{.mark} between in-grained structures on the one hand and
human agency and contingency on the other]{.underline}. It is
[capillary, shape-shifting, always in motion as it constructs threats,
enrolls constituencies, colonizes cultural life, and generates new loci
of resistance]{.underline}. As Michel Foucault (2007:44) writes,
security apparatuses "have the con-stant tendency to expand; they are
centrifugal. New elements are constantly being integrated\....Security
therefore involves or-ganizing, or anyway allowing the development of
ever-wider circuits." And there is [no domain of social life it does not
touch. Just as contemporary wars seem to have no clearly demarcated end,
so **[militarism has no discernible edge]{.mark}**; it [**increasingly
seeps into every corner of the** **world**]{.mark}, every aspect of
social life, in someway. Military/intelligence logics and personnel are
now being directed to manage arenas of life formerly understood as
outside the purview of the military, like development projects in
Africa, humanitarian aid, and responses to environmental catastrophes,
black markets, and the hacking of political parties'
computers]{.underline}. In the words of Catherine Lutz, one of the
foremost anthropological theorists and observers of militarism, the
[process of militariza-tion" has reshaped almost every element of global
social life over the 20th century]{.underline}." It involves an
intensification of the labor and resources allocated to military
purposes, including the shaping of other institu-tions in synchrony with
military goals. Militarization is simul-taneously a discursive process,
involving a shift in general societal beliefs and values in ways
necessary to legitimate the use of force, the organization of large
standing armies and their leaders, and the higher taxes or tribute used
to pay for them. Militarization is intimately connected not only to the
obvious increase in the size of armies and resurgence of mil-itant
nationalisms and militant fundamentalisms but also to the less visible
deformation of human potentials into the hierarchies of race, class,
gender, and sexuality, and to the shaping of national histories in ways
that glorify and legiti-mate military action. (Lutz 2002:723)As Lutz's
comment indicates, the [[material base of militarism]{.mark} is
[connected with ideologies and discourses through which proliferating
**militarized infrastructures and rationalities are
normalized**]{.mark}**, [naturalized, and legitimized]{.mark}**. Such
ideologies and discourses **[valorize the ethos of the
warrior]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Gibson 1994; Orr2004; Webb 2018) and
[construct [threats]{.mark} in such a way as [to validate military
spending,]{.mark} military [interventions]{.mark}, and the
[mil-itarization of formerly nonmilitary arenas of
life]{.mark}]{.underline}. To say that threats are "constructed" does
not mean that they are imaginary or unreal. But [threats can be figured
through different narratives and addressed in different ways, and the
choice of narrative figuration may have enormous material
consequences]{.underline}. The So-viet missiles deployed to Cuba in 1962
were quite real and, if used, would have inflicted crushing damage on
the United States. But the United States could have chosen to regard
them as a reasonable counterweight to its own Jupiter nuclear-tipped
mis-siles in Turkey, on the Soviet Union's doorstep, rather than
pro-voking a global crisis by narrating them as an existential threat
(Weldes 1999). Likewise, based on the evidence of the last 2 de-cades of
US-Vietnamese relations, the United States could plausibly have decided
in the 1960s that its vital interests would have suffered little if a
small country on the other side of the planet were allowed to "go
Communist. "Instead, it fruitlessly expended the lives of over 50,000
Americans and 2--3 million Vietnamese in what American national security
elites wrongly perceived, thanks to the consensually accepted domino
theory, as a struggle it could not afford to lose. Or, as discussed in
this volume, Turkey in the early twentieth century could have
constructed Armenians as constituency to be accommodated, not
exterminated, and Guatemalan and Colombian elites could have constructed
rural challenges against inequality and injustice as a social problem to
address through development and land reform, not a military threat that
demanded counterinsurgency. [In these cases, the preferred threat
constructions militarized the problems at hand, mobilizing more
resources for military projects and saturating the social field with
militarized violence.]{.underline}

#### The alt is feasible and can be implemented through a three-part plan that involves the defunding of the military, the conversion of the economy and the aiding of veterans in their transition to civilian life.

This set of deeply intertwined issues underscores the need for
converting the U.S. military to civilian purposes and control. This
section turns to the specific options and opportunities for a just
transition of the U.S. military.

[This [transition requires nothing less than]{.mark} a [**complete
dismantling** and restructuring of this institution of
war]{.mark}]{.underline}, [firmly rooted under civilian control,
[toward]{.mark} the [goal of]{.mark} [creating]{.mark} an [equitable and
ecological society]{.mark}.]{.underline} There are three broad
strategies to pursue as part of this just transition: spending
reductions and reallocation; economic conversion to a peace economy; and
assistance, retraining, and civilian repurposing for workers and
veterans (D'Agostino and Rynn, 2019). Spending Reductions and
Reallocation Demilitarization and just transition require decreases in
military spending and a green fiscal shift toward meeting urgent social
and environmental needs. Often it is a budget reduction that catalyzes
deeper, more abiding conversions, yet such a curtailment must be
combined with targeted reinvestments (Pemberton and Hartung, 2020).
[[Military spending]{.mark} creates many [fewer jobs]{.mark} than if
those same funds were spent on healthcare, education, and clean energy
and infrastructure, and jobs in these other sectors are on average
equally well or better compensated]{.underline} (Peltier, 2019; Pollin
and Garrett-Peltier, 2011[). [Shifting]{.mark} military [spending to
green]{.mark} manufacturing can support a just transition for regions of
the U.S. experiencing declines in manufacturing, while scaling up
lower-carbon energy infrastructure and public transportation, better
preparing [communities for impacts of climate change,]{.mark} and
improving and expanding jobs in care work]{.underline} (Steichen and
Koshgarian, 2020). A growing consensus is emerging around proposals to
cut military spending. For example, a Defense Spending Reduction Caucus
has been formed in the U.S. Congress, while an amendment was further
introduced in 2020 to cut the Pentagon budget by 10% (Lee, 2020). This
reduction is especially urgent in view of the need for and popularity of
Covid-19 economic relief payments, and changes in rules to allow
significant cuts to the DoD independently of non-defense spending. [Even
[at just 10%,]{.mark} this [reinvestment could achieve significant
benefits]{.mark} across any number of priorities: housing half a million
people, dramatically expanding coronavirus testing, bridging the funding
deficit for majority non-white school districts, providing renewable
energy to nearly every U.S. household, transitioning nearly every worker
in conventional coal, oil, and gas sectors, hiring close to a million
public school elementary educators, and so on]{.underline} (Steichen and
Koshgarian, 2020). At a global level, the opportunities for shifting
funding become even greater, given \$2 trillion annually in global
expenditures (half from the U.S.) on war and war preparations. Small
percentages of this amount could end starvation or provide drinking
water worldwide, reducing unrest, and improving well-being (World Beyond
War, 2020). Economic Conversion In coordination with these shifts in
budgetary priorities[, a [just transition requires converting from a
military to a peace economy]{.mark}, including especially industrial
planning and restructuring.]{.underline} Economic conversion refers to
"political, economic and technical measures for ensuring the orderly
transformation of labor, machinery and other economic resources now
being used for military purposes to alternative civilian uses" (Melman
and Dumas, 1990). Such efforts have been proposed and tested for
decades, emphasizing the use of sector- and community-based planning for
workers and communities dependent on defense and defense industries
(D'Agostino and Rynn, 2019). Beginning with moves toward nuclear
disarmament and the end of the Cold War in the 1980s and 90s, advocates
and organizers seriously examined the necessary elements of conversion
to a peace economy (Melman and Dumas, 1990; Pemberton and Hartung,
2020). In addition to spending reductions and reinvestment, successful
economic conversion depends upon several key conditions. These
conditions include availability of technical and financial assistance to
firms, workers, and communities; supportive civil society measures
including research, education, and legislation; and well-designed
industrial policies and planning. Many examples of successful conversion
can be traced at the level of firms, communities, bases, laboratories,
and sectors since the end of the second world war[. However, the [size
and complexity of the network of militarism in the U.S. now require a
largescale industrial policy to achieve full]{.mark} [disarmament and
demilitarization]{.mark}]{.underline} (Pemberton and Hartung, 2020).
Much has already been learned about scaling up economic conversions.
Especially since the end of the Cold War, the work of Seymour Melman and
colleagues, along with efforts of labor and trade unions, has provided a
foundation for this comprehensive approach to economic conversion and
industrial planning. These lessons reflect the fact that for decades,
military priorities have served as the de facto plan for the U.S.
economy, and markets are incapable of making the needed shift to
peaceful economies (Eisenscher, 2014; Melman and Dumas, 1990).
Supportive legislation nearly passed as early as 1963, while legislation
such as the Defense Economic Adjustment Act has been introduced in
various forms since the early 1990s (Swanson, 2010). More recently,
Miriam Pemberton and others have put forward comprehensive strategies
for defense transition that operate at all levels and are federally
funded and resourced, and state- and locally coordinated and implemented
(Pemberton, 2018). The scale and pace of change needed now demand new
models for economic conversion. [[Demilitarization]{.mark} and
conversion to a peace economy will [require explicit]{.mark} industrial
[planning]{.mark} in public and private sectors]{.underline}, a
challenge in the U.S. context to say the least. Nevertheless, [[several
tools]{.mark} may [provide]{.mark} a [starting point]{.mark} if applied
to the purpose of a just transition]{.underline}. One obvious measure is
to implement new rounds of base closures through the Base Realignment
and Closure process, especially including closures of overseas bases,
and to shift the savings to just transition and civilian priorities.
Closed bases and installations could serve as new sites for restored
ecosystems and alternative energy generation (Crawford, 2019). [[Another
measure would be to shift]{.mark} the [focus]{.mark} of the Defense
Production Act, which provides presidential authority to expedite and
expand materials and services from U.S. industries, [toward emergency
preparedness]{.mark}.]{.underline} A specific focus would be to minimize
hazards and impacts of climate change and protect and restore critical
infrastructure---both built and natural---as needed for a just
transition. In the context of climate emergency, a more direct approach
to large-scale industrial planning could effectively reverse the
function of the War Production Board, which was active during the
wartime period. This mode of planning would instead convert factories
from manufacture of weapons and military equipment to peacetime
industries under public control, while conserving high-priority
materials and limiting waste and luxury items. It is important to
emphasize in the context of emergency preparedness and climate
resilience, the point is not to extend military control but rather to
unequivocally transfer resources and responsibility of the existing
military apparatus to civilian control (Barber and Bennis, 2020). For
example, civilian organizations such as the U.S. Public Health Service
or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would assume
responsibility for medical staff, equipment, and facilities. All these
methods and more will need to be integrated over time within a broad
strategy of demilitarized industrial planning for conversion to a peace
economy. Assistance, Retraining, and Civilian Repurposing [The third
general [strategy for]{.mark} a just [transition]{.mark} of the U.S.
military [centers on]{.mark} the [contribution of]{.mark} the [workers
and]{.mark} their [communities toward minimizing ecological catastrophe
and providing for basic needs]{.mark}. This [strategy]{.mark} therefore
[involves]{.mark} coordinating [targeted assistance, retraining, and
transitioning]{.mark} current military service members and contractors
toward peace economy sectors, industries, and services. Ensuring social
assistance and retraining provides the baseline for a demilitarized just
transition.]{.underline} Here again, experience offers many examples,
including the various GI Bills, Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment
Assistance, the Veterans Retraining Assistance Program and Transition
Assistance Program, and so on. Often under the charge of the Department
of Veterans Affairs, these programs have demonstrated their ability to
make a meaningful difference to people transitioning from military to
civilian life by providing assistance and benefits for education,
housing, business support, counseling, jobs training, and monthly
subsistence payments. [Funds could be reallocated from the DoD to the VA
including the Office of Transition and Economic Development to
dramatically scale up financial and logistical support for these
transitions. This process must also involve redirecting economic
activity and livelihoods. This would involve retraining public employees
displaced by the phase out of military programs and offering them
meaningful work in other federal, state, or local agencies, as engineers
and mechanics, electricians, public health workers, accountants, and so
on]{.underline} (D'Agostino and Rynn, 2019). Many of these programs,
historically and presently, emphasize private sector employment in
anticipation that the market can supply the needed work. Here again, the
present context requires a more targeted system of transition that aims
to rectify existing social inequities and minimize ecological
catastrophe. This means providing high-quality jobs to build and repair
public infrastructure, construct public water and wastewater systems,
clean up toxic and nuclear waste sites, restore ecological habitats,
provide national and international disaster preparedness and relief, and
build new and retrofit existing housing, libraries, and schools.
[Alongside these priorities, a [just transition also calls for creating
new opportunities for local manufacturing and production and
worker-owned businesses]{.mark} and cooperatives, and providing
technical and administrative assistance to communities facing these
converging crises]{.underline} (D'Agostino and Rynn, 2019; Melman and
Dumas, 1990). An especially relevant opportunity follows from the
growing calls for a re-envisioned and permanent Civilian Conservation
Corps (CCC), or a Civilian Climate Corps as proposed in the first days
of the Biden Administration. The original CCC, sometimes known as
Roosevelt's Tree Army, operated from 1933 to 1942 as a New Deal public
work relief program. The CCC was highly popular, employing millions, and
completing a vast number of projects including planting trees, building
parks and trails, fighting fires, and protecting soils. The CCC helped
influence environmental programs and attitudes that continue to this
day. Yet this program did not provide long-term, high-quality jobs,
reinforced racial and gender inequities, and became militarized and
subsumed under the war effort (Alexander, 2018; Heller, 2009; Maher,
2008). The just transition needed now would function differently. [A
[reimagined CCC]{.mark} would [create high-value work]{.mark}
[especially in ecological restoration]{.mark} and [climate
resilience]{.mark}, [rectify inequities]{.mark}, and [set a clear path
for workers and communities to demilitarize in a way that is responsive
to present and future needs]{.mark}]{.underline} (Aronoff et al., 2019).
Boosted by funds reallocated from the military budget, a new Civilian
Climate Corps could provide transitioning workers with well-paid union
jobs as "conservation and resilience workers" who restore lands and
waters, build green infrastructure, install solar panels and wind
towers, sequester carbon in soils, protect biodiversity, clean up toxic
waste, and much more (The White House, 2021). To align this initiative
more closely with principles for a just transition, the program must
center on the needs and priorities among Black, Indigenous, and People
of Color (BIPOC), while providing skills needed for lifelong work in a
demilitarized, post-fossil-fuel economy (Collier, 2021). [Just as the
military now serves as the nation's largest federal employer, this
[repurposed program could further]{.mark} [serve as]{.mark} a [key
element of]{.mark} a [federal public jobs guarantee program]{.mark},
[thus ensuring a viable transition for military workers, families, and
communities]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Behind this current crisis lies a history of militarised and economic
violence. [Both Russia and the United States are settler colonial
states, forging their countries by expanding their "frontiers" and
killing and repressing Indigenous populations]{.underline}. [Both engage
in imperialist actions outside of their now-established borders,
interfering, through military and economic action, in countries they
deem to be within their "spheres of influence". Both use militarism,
aggression, and forced economic ties to guide their conduct in
international relations, and both deal with domestic inequality,
poverty, and resistance through policing and punishment.]{.underline}

[The governments of both countries critique each other for the same type
of behaviour. Russia criticises US imperialism, yet invades and occupies
its neighbours,]{.underline} bombs civilians, and engages in
cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure that harm ordinary people.
[The United States criticises Russia as an autocracy yet overthrows
democratically elected governments if they threaten US interests, builds
military bases and engages in wars and military operations in hundreds
of countries around the world, and spends billions of dollars a year on
militarism while so many of its citizens live without health care,
housing, or food security.]{.underline}

Both countries have built up their militaries, military alliances, and
nuclear arsenals to challenge the other. [The North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO)'s expansion eastward is about constraining Russia,
just like Russia's invasion of countries to the west are about
constraining NATO. Ukraine, in this context, is a pawn being used by
both "sides".]{.underline}

[This gamesmanship runs the serious risk of mass
destruction]{.underline}. [Between them,]{.underline} Russia and the
United States possess [more than 11,850 nuclear weapons. NATO members
France and the United Kingdom have a few hundred each]{.underline}. [The
US also stations about 100 nuclear weapons in NATO members Belgium,
Germany, Italy, Netherlands, and Turkey. These weapons are not remnants
of a past Cold War --- they are actively deployed right now, ready to be
used.]{.underline} The stockpile numbers, alarming as they are, don't
convey the sheer horror each weapon packs within it. [Every single bomb
is designed to melt flesh, burn cities, decimate plants and animals, and
unleash radioactive poison that lasts for generations. Even the use of
one of these weapons would be disastrous. A nuclear exchange would be
catastrophic]{.underline}.

[Russia and the United States, along with France, United Kingdom, and
China, together recently agreed that a nuclear war cannot be
won]{.underline} and must never be fought, echoing a statement from
Gorbachev and Reagan in 1985. Yet each of these countries has been
investing billions in the "modernisation" and expansion of their nuclear
arsenals, preparing not for nuclear disarmament but for nuclear
Armageddon. Each maintains doctrines and policies for the use of nuclear
weapons. [And some within the US nuclear complex, at least, apparently
believe that nuclear war can be fought --- and won. This is an
incredibly dangerous message to be sending to those responsible for the
potential destruction of the world, but one that benefits the
military-industrial complex]{.underline}.

alarmism of the past few years aside, Europe is under no threat from
Russia, which the Europeans seem to understand far better than Americans
do. And since its reunification, Germany has become the economic and
political heart of a peaceful project of European union. Sixty years
since its founding and nearly 20 years since the end of the Cold War, it
is well past time to dismantle NATO.

[In the end, the main argument for perpetuating [the NATO relic is that
it provides the support structure for projecting power into remote parts

defensive alliance dedicated to European security now has little to do
with either defense or Europe. [[The Alliance is not only
outdated]{.mark} for America's European allies, who increasingly see no

#### Aff's framing of countries as aggressive justifies violence abroad and ignores the internal warfare at home

[But what is it at stake is not just the definition of police, but of
war.]{.underline} Since at least the end of the Cold War, the concept of
militarization has been taken on-board across many disciplines. [We read

1990](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569))
to the 'militarization of entertainment' ([Turse
2008](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).
This literature generally portrays the sense that war has become more
expansive than conflicts among nation-states, with security and
surveillance becoming increasingly central to areas of social life,
which appear distinct from formal military engagements. Our argument is
not with the merits or the validity of this work but rather with its
assumption of there being a traditional form of warfare -- most
generally defined as a geographically bounded and declared Clausewitzian
struggle between states for power and territory]{.underline}. The most
far reaching critique of such narrow definitions comes from [Mark
Neocleous'
(2000](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569), [2008](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569), [2010](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569), [2011](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569), [2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569))
work on security and pacification. [The liberal definition of war as a
confrontation between formally opposed states both ignores 'the
transnational nature of a great deal of warfare' and 'obscure the
structural and systematic violence through which liberal order has been
constituted']{.underline} ([Neocleous
2010](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
9). [This ideological blurring goes back to European imperialism where,
from the 16th century onwards, complex legal and philosophical arguments
were used to present wars of colonial expansion as police actions to
ensure peace and security -- often referred to as 'small wars'. The
military campaigns at the forefront of conquest and violent accumulation
were philosophically and ideologically rationalized as necessary to
pacify 'savage' populations and to liberate their bodies and resources
for the benefit of civilization ([Neocleous
2010](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
14). A key point of liberal thought is conceptualizing the military as
an institution solely for foreign policy and the 'over there' and the
police as a domestic institution only deployed 'here' for law
enforcement and keeping the peace. Through this logic, the liberal state
set itself up as different from feudal power and later what would become
known as the totalitarian or 'police state', in which warfare against
citizens is said to be unbound. Therefore, the notion that police powers
and war powers come from different logics and mandates is a relatively
recent notion that largely emerges out of liberal doctrines on state
power (i.e. separation of powers and rule of law), which of course also
merged with a nascent capitalist modernity (which was contingent on mass
state and private violence against the indigenous, slaves and poor
people). What is deliberately obscured is how civil society under
capitalism is already at war.]{.underline} As described by Marx in
Volume One of Capital [the history of liberalism is also of the 'logic
of war, exercised in a permanent fashion against rebellious slaves,
antagonistic Indians, wayward workers, and criminals with something
unsocial in mind']{.underline} ([Neocleous
2010](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
15). Two centuries later, we see '[semi-permanent wars against the enemy
within and without -- such as the war on drugs and the war on terror'
([Neocleous
2010](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
16). The dominant thrust of the liberal tradition is thus to simplify
the complexity of political power into dichotomies with policing and war
treated as separate endeavours, represented by different institutions
and practised within separate territories.]{.underline} However, even
left theorists across different disciplines have accepted these
distinctions, [leading to work which focuses on the 'overlaps' and
'blurring' between the police and military, rather than on war and
police as 'processes working in conjunction as state power']{.underline}
([Neocleous
2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
587). From this standpoint, [the question is not then about how the
police resemble militaries, but rather the role that the police play in
the liberal war for peace and pacification.]{.underline} In order to
understand this, we first need to understand the liberal arguments,
which are at the centre of the police militarization concept.

### LIO 

#### Preserving the LIO is only an excuse for both external and internal war

**McMichael 16** (Christopher, PhD in Politics from Rhodes University,
research include organized crime, Libertarian Marxism, and Fascism,
"Pacification and Police: A critique of the Police Militarization
Thesis," November 29 2016,
https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)

[The militarization thesis is also haunted by the spectre of the police
state in both the past and the future]{.underline}. On one hand, this is
accompanied by nostalgic descriptions of 'real' policing -- as [Balko
(2013b)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569) rhetorically
asks,

[How did we go from a system in which laws were enforced by the citizens
... to one in which order is preserved by armed governments agents too
often conditioned to see streets and neighbourhoods as battlefields and
the citizens they serve as enemy?]{.underline}

[Historical examples of state despotism from Nazi Germany to Stalinist
Russia are used to depict what a society looks like when 'constraints
demarcating policing and military functions are either ineffective or
absent']{.underline} ([Hall & Coyne
2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
485). These equivalences to past regimes are also used as a guide to the
possible future outlaid by militarization with many commentaries,
including variations on the theme of 'America may not be a police state
-- that is a political system characterised by an arbitrary exercise of
power by police -- but it's getting too close for comfort' ([Greenhunt
2008](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).

But the extent to which militarization is presented as a novel
contemporary phenomenon may reveal nothing so much as the extent to
which police institutions have been ideologically successful in
naturalizing their role in society. As a result new developments in
tactics and equipment come to be presented as a disturbing deviation
from the norm. However, this focus on internal signifiers of violence
blurs how even 'community' and public-orientated policing can work in
accord with overt aggression. To the extent that the militarization
thesis seems more concerned with excess and spectacle, it misses the
routine repression of 'officer friendly' as he or she walks the beat,
patrols the neighbourhood, and visits schools to build public relations
and win popular support. In the United States, one police response to
the social crisis of the 1960s was to experiment with 'softer' law
enforcement to pre-empt social response, which drew upon 'hearts and
minds' tactics, originating in military counter-insurgency ([Williams
2012](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
91). 'Militarization' is therefore just one of the key changes in recent
US policing, working in tandem with other forms of softer power.

The idea that police violence and repression is exceptional is
encouraged by a political discourse, which maintains that in liberal
democratic societies, state power is fundamentally constrained by the
rule of law and a concern for human rights. Indeed, many of the
critiques of 'police militarization' hold that 'military' policing can
be legitimate as long as it is kept within the bounds of law. For
instance, one ACLU advocate said that

The militarization of local police is a threat to Americans' right to
live without fear of military-style intervention in their daily lives,
and we need to make sure these resources and tactics are deployed only
with rigorous oversight and strong legal protections. ([ACLU
2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569))

This faith in legal protection is counterpoised with the threat that
seems to lurk in the background of the militarization discourse: the
'police state'. Underlying this is the idea that a 'blurring' between
the military and the police is a hallmark of the despotic state, and in
particular the various Fascist and Stalinist states of the last century,
with their vast coercive apparatuses. [What this implies is that liberal
democracies have a categorically different kind of police and criminal
justice system: one that is intended to protect the interests and
property of its ('law abiding') citizens rather than internal warfare.
Such an ideology holds that while 'conquest and bloodshed' may have been
central to the genesis of capitalist modernity, contemporary liberal
states are marked by fundamentally peaceful social relations ([Trocchi
2011](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
305).]{.underline} In its most media-driven form, the militarization
thesis, as it relies on the assumption of separation of police power and
war power, therefore, generally regards police as a fundamentally benign
institution in society, which provides a central public service and
which needs to be steered away from the dangerous pull of militarism.

The militarization concept assumes that the boundary between war and
police powers is a common sense fact of life in liberal societies, in
which the police should manage disputes and enforce laws without favour
and with minimum resort to force. But even a cursory acquaintance with
older police sociology indicates that the police are principally
involved in domestic operations to uphold the dominant social order.
For [Alan Silver
(1965)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569),
[the police emerged as an elite response to the threat posed by the
dangerous classes of poor to property -- 'a sophisticated and convenient
form of garrison force against an internal enemy'. The role of police
goes beyond suppression of internal threats and entails a wide variety
of activities, from general administration to pursuing their own
interests ([Marenin
1982](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).
It was crucial for early police institutions to legitimate themselves,
whether through identification with the concept of the rule of law, or
direct involvement in communities ([Monkkonen
1981](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).
But while we can reject a crude, instrumentalist understanding of the
police as exclusively concerned with class repression, the point remains
that these spectrum of activities, from daily patrolling to intelligence
gathering, should not be assumed to be in the ' defence of a universal
consensus of the public good' ([Marenin
1982](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
259). Rather, these functions all work to uphold state order and to
administer daily life under capitalism.]{.underline}

Along with the underlying assumption that the police uphold a universal
public good, [the concept of police militarization makes the a priori
assumption that foreign warfare does not, or at least should not, have
any bearing on the 'everyday' functions of the police. Many liberal
thinkers have viewed warfare as both the last resort of state power and
as antithetical to capitalism because it interrupts production and
consumption ([Kaldor
1982](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
264). In fact, 'the notion of militarism is itself capitalist. It
emerges with the distinction between warriors and entrepreneurs in place
of the feudal lord' ([Kaldor
1982](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).
But this distaste for war is ambivalent as liberals accept the war may
also be necessary to prevent interruptions to the market and to extend
'civilization'. Liberals therefore accept war as a historical necessity
in establishing the reach of the market and the nation state; but once
order has been established, military power is to be withdrawn and
replaced with administrative forms of internal pacification ([Giddens
1985](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).
To frame it another way, once the green uniforms have subdued the
territory, the blue uniforms manage it.]{.underline}

[Liberal thought maintains that there is sharp and clear distinction
between the green and blue, and it is this distinction between war and
police that needs to be refused.]{.underline} That is, the creation of
the distinction itself is what does the political work of liberal
ideology in obfuscating the fact that the police mandate has always been
a mandate of social war. [This distinction effectively amounts to a
conceptual removal of war from the framing of social order and internal
politics, ultimately reifying the 'war' and 'peace' distinction by
misrecognizing 'peace' as itself a 'war' for capitalist social order The
remainder of this article will contest this on two fronts. First, the
idea of a classic distinction between the police and military simply
does not hold up under historical scrutiny. Second, this distinction is
indicative of liberalisms broader inability to depict how war is
imbricated within all aspects of capitalist society, and especially in
policing. This entails a rethinking of police as a project of
pacification.]{.underline}

#### Liberty is only an excuse to continue to extend war and police power

**McMichael 16** (Christopher, PhD in Politics from Rhodes University,
research include organized crime, Libertarian Marxism, and Fascism,
"Pacification and Police: A critique of the Police Militarization
Thesis," November 29 2016,
https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)

Historically[, liberals have praised the spontaneity of the market, in
contrast with the 'artificial, violent constructivism' of other
societies, and presented this as a virtuous cycle where economic freedom
regulates and reduces the need for state intervention]{.underline}
([Losurdo
2011](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
283[). On one level, liberalism is a political philosophy in which peace
and freedom are seen to be the end historical goals of the extension of
market order. But this discourse of emancipation has been historically
tangled with dis-emancipation in which violent policing operations to
contain the dangerous classes and foreign barbarians are the mechanisms
for extending peace]{.underline} ([Losurdo
2011](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
286, 342). [Therefore, the precondition for liberty and the pursuit of
rational self-interest is the extension of police and war power. Rather
than being primarily focused on liberty, liberalism is thus a politics
of security, concerned with reshaping individuals, groups and
territories in the image of capital]{.underline} ([Neocleous
2008](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
5). [It is in this pursuit of security in the name of liberty that the
most authoritarian tendencies of liberalism become apparent, from police
killings to the revival of torture and indefinite detention. The danger
is not therefore that liberal states can become more like fascist ones
through 'police militarization', but rather that security politics
reveal the fascist or authoritarian tendencies within liberal democracy
already ([Neocleous
2008](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
9). In turn, this entails a particular situation where the continual
expansion of intrusive police powers has historically been justified in
terms of protecting individual freedom, while in practise encouraging
despotic power in the protection of economic interests. For example,
during the Cold War, the US government provided training and financial
support to repressive police forces throughout the world, many which
regularly engaged in torture and murder, in the name of fighting
totalitarianism ([Kuzmarov
2012](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).
A similar process can be observed today when anti-democratic extensions
in police and military power are legitimated as measures against
anti-democratic extremism.]{.underline}

[Recent scholarship has focused on the idea of 'war: police assemblages'
evident in 'contemporary liberal interventionism', such as in the
combination of clandestine drone attacks and special force
interventions, full scale military invasions and counter-insurgency
which have characterised recent wars in the Middle East and beyond
([Bell
2015](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).
But as [Ryan
(2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
441) points out the history of policing indicates that these current
assemblages are not a recent phenomenon -- 'policing arrives once the
condition for order have been violently established by the military so
that reason of state can be implemented. Policing is the continuation of
military actions by other means'. Viewed as continuum or assemblage,
even a cursory survey highlights the extent to which the police have
been central to the disciplining and oppression of the domestic enemies
of liberal states. To give just a few examples, by the end of the 18th
century, police forces in Europe were engaged in regular manhunts to
round up beggars and vagrants ([Chamayou
2012](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
81), while across the Atlantic, the millions of Africans forced into
bondage in the Americas were kept in line with slave patrols, which
scholars are now increasingly viewing as one of the key forerunners of
modern US policing ([Hadden
2003](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).
The police were also at the forefront of state efforts to control 'free
labour' through the suppression of strikes and revolts in the workplace.
To give the example of just one country, the police were key agents in
the 'strikes (which moved) towards miniature civil wars between workers
and the state' during periods of intense labour militancy in the United
States ([Brecher
1972](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
236). However, this history is regularly omitted in contemporary
discussions of police militarization.]{.underline} An illustrative
quote, worth citing in full is from an interview conducted with [Radley
Balko
(2013b)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569) by
the popular Vice website during which he details a version of (US)
police history, in which

The Founders were quite wary of standing armies and the threat they pose
to liberty. They ultimately concluded -- reluctantly -- that the country
needed an army for national defense. But they most feared the idea of
troops patrolling city streets -- a fear colored by much of human
history, and more immediately by the antagonism between British troops
and residents of Boston in the years leading up to the American
Revolution. The Founders could never have envisioned police as they
exist today. And I think it's safe to say they'd have been absolutely
appalled at the idea of a team of police, dressed and armed like
soldiers, breaking into private homes in the middle of the night for the
purpose of preventing the use of mind-altering drugs.

[What Balko omits is the question of how war and police power were
deployed against groups considered as undeserving of liberty by the
'founders': slaves, American Indians, African slaves, the property-less
and women. The violent economy of chattel slavery and oppression of
indigenous peoples gained their political force from the police power.
Indeed, in the heroic age of liberty conjured by Balko, the Founders
were in fact prepared to use military force to suppress internal revolt,
such as in the case of the 1794 rebellion against the Whiskey Tax by
farmers in Pennsylvania in which Alexander Hamilton led troops against
the revolt]{.underline} ([Zinn
1995](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
100). Tracing the history of the police power and not just 'the
police', [Markus Dubber
(2005)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569) writes
of the ways that the 'Founders' retained the notion of unlimited and
undefinable police powers that operated in England. He writes, 'Ending
the king's police power, it turns out, did not mean ending police power
altogether ... Americans didn't appreciate being policed, but they had
no qualms about policing' (p. 83).

[The policing of imperialism occurred in tandem with the foundation of
modern police forces in Europe, but crucially this linkage was played
down at the time. In the case of Britain, for instance, the creation of
the police was influenced by experiments with colonial warfare in
Ireland, albeit framed very differently: While the discourse for police
advocacy for Ireland explicitly invoked the need for a paramilitary
police under the spectre of 'real or suspected insurrectionary
conspiracies', the militaristic character of policing could not enter
the discourses of advocacy in the metropolis ([Williams
2003](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
231). This occurred in a context in which Atlantic political thinkers
and the administrators in the late 18th and 19th centuries began to call
for a professionalized body of standing police officers, capable of both
managing the potential threats posed by growing proletariats in the
metropole and the colonies and protecting production ([Williams
2003](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).
The military was not a practical institution to govern emerging
capitalist societies:]{.underline}

[alternating as it does between no intervention and the most drastic and
violent procedures. The newly emerging police, in contrast, could
penetrate civil society in a way impossible for military formations,
less to crush disorder in the form of riots (though it also came to do
that of course) and more to fabricate an order in which such disorder
did not occur. ([Neocleous
2000](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
78)]{.underline}

[The liberal demand for order was therefore not about so much reducing
the threat of arbitrary military power, but rather of ensuring a more
thorough policing of civil society, which was regularized and
comprehensive ([Silver
1965](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).
In practise, however, the differences between the military and police
was often more a question of degrees than of fundamental divergences of
function, especially evident in colonies. In the case of South Africa,
for instance, 'the military feature of policing' was dominant -- both in
terms of the institutional history of serving as an 'internal army of
occupation' and in the usage of police formations as military units
during war-time ([Brogden
1989](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
3). Throughout the British Empire, there are similar examples of
military forces gradually developing into police
institutions.]{.underline}

[The point which derives from these examples is that the dual historical
formation of the nation-state and capitalism saw military and police
forces enrolled in shared projects of conquest and control. These
different forces were joined as part of the machinery of State --
'armies of wars of colonial pacification, international competition and
domestic repression' ([Robinson
1983](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
20). However, this is not to argue that the police are interchangeable
with the military. Instead, they are able to conduct internal operations
in a far more sustained but, when considering the historical record,
often as violent a manner as military forces:]{.underline}

[As states defined a part of their own population as an enemy, the
military learned from those who know how to locate individuals and to
'interrogate' them: the police. If military dictatorships were so
effective in suppressing all political opposition and taking thousands
of lives, if they could wage unilateral 'wars' on their own populations,
it was thanks to the 'police method' ...]{.underline} ([Seri
2012](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
118)

[Police institutions, thus, have a distinct role in 'facilitating
authoritarianism and state violence]{.underline} ... that the scholarly
emphasis on "militarization" tends to ignore' ([Seri
2012](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).
The general thrust of much of the police militarization literature has
been to portray police authoritarianism as intrinsic to non-liberal
states but aberrant to capitalist democracies. Liberal societies are
understood to be policed societies, in which the institutions work to
achieve peace and prosperity in a regulated and consistent fashion,
rather than police states, in which officers are at war with society.
[As argued in the previous section, this distinction omits the pivotal
role played by police and military violence and terror in the foundation
and extension of capitalism. But this is not limited to primitive
accumulation but rather is a central, continuous process of pacification
and of fabricating order through police patrolling, surveillance and
governance. Police power is not restricted to repression of the state's
enemies but in the daily regulation of society, from administering
discriminatory labour practices and environmental practices to
penalizing the illicit economic activities of the poor. Police both
intervene in the workplace, through their involvement in strikes and
industrial disputes, and are the key instruments in enforcing social
control over the dispossessed 'underclass', who are not integrated into
the labour force. In a history of class war in the United States
originally published
in [1931](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569),
the journalist Louis Adamic noted that the 'police club' was the
pre-eminent symbol of capitalist power (p. 23). Almost a century later,
the police club is now accompanied by pepper spray, tear gas, armoured
vehicles and drones, but the police still represent the main force
employed by the state to attack and control the social tensions
generated by economic inequality and exploitation -- from industrial
conflict in the early 20th century to street battles around austerity
and crisis in the early 21st century. Of course, the nature of whom and
what is policed changes over time, and in line with changes in
capitalist order, from domination over nascent industrial proletariats
in the 19th century to regular campaigns of harassment against the
unemployed and migrants in the post-industrial badlands of
neo-liberalism.]{.underline}

[But even without the more high tech accoutrements, the generic officer
on the beat is nevertheless a figure of considerable power who enforces
state domination on the street, and in particular against the 'dangerous
classes'. Indeed, Mike Brown was not gunned down in the middle of a
Ferguson street by an overtly military-inspired SWAT agent. He was
gunned down by the routine patrol officer, the state agent that is
dressed in 'traditional' police attire and driving the 'traditional'
police cruiser that more closely resembles the 'community policing
solution' that so many public commentators have posited to supplant
police militarization. Yet, soon after the routine execution of Brown,
quickly most all of the controversy and criticism of the police power
were aimed at the use of military gear, aesthetics, and tactics --
attention was placed steadfastly on the spectacle of police--military
repression. Of course, we are not suggesting that these developments
should not be ruthlessly critiqued. They certainly demonstrate a
significant ability of the local state to deploy maximum force. But here
the spectacle stayed true to its own governing logic, hiding in plain
sight the equally insidious violence of the 'good old
police'.]{.underline}

#### Aff's discourse of pacification is inseparable with the logic of militarism which entrenches colonialism

**McMichael 16** (Christopher, PhD in Politics from Rhodes University,
research include organized crime, Libertarian Marxism, and Fascism,
"Pacification and Police: A critique of the Police Militarization
Thesis," November 29 2016,
https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)

The inability of the militarization argument to acknowledge how a patrol
officer with a nightstick may be as much of a cause of terror and fear
as the machine gun waving SWAT team unit, is further indicator of its
liberal bent. [Moreover, the popular lexicon of police militarization
doesn't offer any ability to critique the police officer reading books
to children at a public school, or passing out candy during a parade, or
holding 'public forums', press conferences and 'community meetings'.
Hence, instead of thinking about the police/war assemblage through the
notion of militarization, it might be best to think of this through the
idea of pacification. Although pacification most commonly evokes US
counter-insurgency efforts in Vietnam, the concept has a much longer
history, emerging first in the Edicts of Pacification of the mid to late
1500s, where these laws were said to be aimed at the ending of strife
and to make populations submit to state rule primarily through peaceful
methods. Drawing on [Todorov
(1984)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569),
Neocleous reminds us that, in 1573, Philip II ordered that 'conquests'
be renamed 'pacification', so as to help build consent among the
colonized. As [Neocleous
(2011)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569) states,]{.underline}

[The dates are important, since they are deep into the period of global
accumulation and the history of capital, or, in other words, the point
of departure for the period in which the insecurity of bourgeois order
had to be secured. (p. 199)]{.underline}

From here pacification became a means of original accumulation through
the colonial conquests of the 17th century, only to be re-theorized,
re-named and re-deployed across a plethora of more contemporary colonial
geographies, from French counter-insurgency in Algeria and Indo-China,
to Britain's engagements in Malaysia, Cyprus and Kenya, to US
counter-insurgencies in Vietnam. [Pacification is best thought of as a
central strategy of the colonialist, capitalist state as it works to
secure the insecurities of accumulation both domestically and
internationally, and this lines up with the police mandate. Instead of
only describing state power as a pacification project, [Neocleous
(2011)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569) argues
that critical theory should reappropriate the concept of pacification as
a way of understanding the security politics of liberal order building,
as capital works to secure accumulation and the state demands
order.]{.underline}

[As a way of thinking through the police and war assemblage as always
about the fabrication of order and productive labour, the notion of
pacification better highlights the ways that coercion and consent are
always the flip sides to the security coin. That is, it usefully
accounts for not only the excesses or spectacular forms of police
violence that the militarization thesis is rightly concerned about but
also offers a way of thinking through the routine, non-spectacular
violence of 'Officer Friendly' as well as this agents attempts of
winning 'hearts and minds'. Pacification, then, helps to keep in
constant focus the iron fist and velvet glove of police power. Yet,
pacification, with its evocation of counter-insurgency, colonization and
war, doesn't base its claims on making a distinction between police and
war, or peace and war, or even foreign and domestic. Pacification, then,
is not only an international, colonizing strategy as it is most commonly
discussed (i.e. colonization of Algeria, Vietnam, Malaysia, for
example), but simultaneously a way of fabricating domestic order, as
liberalism deploys the police concept in relation to domestic dangers
and threats. Police, then, at least in the domestic sense of the term,
becomes a pacifying power directed at ordering the disorderly and
possessing the dispossessed, or the 'reserve armies of labor' so central
to capitalist modernity. But whether as war power or police power,
pacification is animated by the inseparable logics of security and
order, and hinges on a joint strategy of coercion and consent. [Rigakos
(2011)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569) suggests
that pacification as an 'anti-security' concept usefully gets at the
heart of class struggle and the violence of capitalist modernity, as it
implies that there are subjects and populations that refuse efforts at
their pacification, which of course is inseparable from struggles over
space. To think in terms of pacification, then, is to also ask who is
being pacified and for what reasons and objectives]{.underline}
([Rigakos
2011](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).

While the militarization literature has highlighted the repressive
impacts of the wars on drugs, crime and terror on policing, this has
primarily been understood as a matter of error and bad policy, in which
the inaccurate metaphor of war mutates the 'true' function of policing.
Understood as pacification, the wars on drugs, crime and terror are not
actually metaphors at all but are real wars which 'slip and slide from
the foreign into the domestic and back again' ([Neocleous
2011](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
201). At different points, for instance, the war on drugs involved
military engagements in Latin America, provided a rationale for expanded
police powers and massive growth of the prison population in the United
States. This logic of security is also repurposed for police and
military projects undertaken by other states. For example, the war on
drugs in Mexico and Colombia has been used to displace communities from
resource rich areas, for attacks on labour organizing and to create an
environment favourable for corporate investment ([Paley
2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).
In post-apartheid South Africa, police methods adopted from the US war
on drugs were incorporated into a new 'war on crime', targeting
undocumented migrants and the urban poor ([Samara
2011](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).
The exchange between war and policing is more insidious and
sophisticated than just the transference of combat equipment into the
domestic sphere, with models of population control and public relations
honed in counter-insurgency returning to the domestic streets ([Williams
2012](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).

The liberal focus on establishing the correct boundaries between war and
policing is also tactically problematic for political activism and
organizing, as its shift the critique of police power away from issues
of structural oppression and state violence into that of due process.
For example, in the wake of the 2015 Baltimore uprisings following the
police killing of Freddie Gray, President Obama has promised to restrict
the federal transfer of military equipment to local police departments.
But while this gives the surface appearance of answering the radical
challenges presented by insurgent protest, it clearly does not actually
address the racism and everyday brutality which sparks revolt. Unlike
more bluntly authoritarian political system, the liberal state can
incorporate pressure for reform from below into governance in a manner
that appears to be progressive while, maintaining the ruling order.
Writing in the wake of the social revolts of the 1960s, [Wolfe
(1971)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569) observed
that political repression in liberal states required a great deal of
social consent, won through the agents of the state appearing to be
consistent and law abiding, and the incorporation of the discourses and
critiques raised by dissenting groups. Thus, policing in the United
States since the 1970s has combined the impulse of militarization with
community policing, in which the police are trained to be more
'sensitive' about racism and sexism ([Williams
2007](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).
Such a combination results in a more sophisticated repression, as
communities are enlisted to collaborate with the police, while still
maintaining an expanded capacity to deploy violence.

By failing to address the complex and sophisticated mechanisms of police
repression in capitalist democracies, liberal critique ends up focusing
on procedures and appearance to the 'point where ends are irrelevant'
([Wolfe
1971](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
34). The idea of militarization takes a legalistic focus on achieving
the 'proper' form of policing, a discourse which easily be co-opted by
the state. At core, it is based on a liberal frame of trying to
establish appropriate boundaries between military and police, rather
than looking at how war and police overlap and conjoin in the everyday
governance of capitalism. It is focused on the apparent danger of
liberal democracies becoming more like despotic political systems while
obfuscating the fundamental violence of the liberal state. By contrast,
thinking on police violence and state repression through the concept of
pacification highlights that this is potentially already existent and
apparent within liberalism itself. The problem is not that liberal
democracies could become dystopic tyrannies through the negative pull of
militarization, but rather that there is already a violent social war
within capitalist society. And within this conflict, police institutions
are central mechanisms for ensuring class and racial dominance already
and have been since their founding.

### S/O

#### US international actions militarized law enforcements domestically 

**Mack 21** ( Marvin, journalist for Business Insider, Yahoo News, "How
America's State Police Got Military Weapons", Insider, April 28 2021,
https://www.businessinsider.com/how-did-local-police-acquire-surplus-military-weapons-2020-8

Narrator: [After the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25,
people protested in at least 140 cities across the nation. Here in
Indiana, a protestor lost an eye from a tear gas container hitting him
in the face.]{.underline}

[In North Carolina, protesters were trapped by a cloud of tear gas on
both ends of a street. In Kentucky, an officer attacked a newscaster and
camera crew with pepper bullets.]{.underline}

[And here in Detroit, police backed by armored vehicles marched down the
streets. To date, the US has spent over \$15 billion on the
militarization of police.]{.underline}

[All of these weapons, vehicles, and equipment are acquired by the
police through a military program called 1033.]{.underline}

[It\'s like eBay for cops with leftover war equipment, except everything
is free and you only pay for shipping and handling. Up until 2017,
police couldn\'t be in the program unless they used equipment within a
year of receiving it.]{.underline}

So how did local police acquire all of these military weapons? And why
do they even need them? To answer this question, we\'re going to examine
four moments in history.

Clip: From Dallas, Texas, the flash apparently official, President
Kennedy died at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time.

Narrator: [In the wake of the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy, President Lyndon B. Johnson and Congress signed the Safe
Streets Act into law in June of 1968.]{.underline}

[Through that act, in an effort to crack down on organized crime and gun
violence, the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration was
created.]{.underline}

[LEAA guaranteed the distribution of federal money to fight organized
crime. This funded what we know as SWAT, and it ensured SWAT received
searchlights, emergency radios, bullhorns, nightsticks, body armor, face
shields, and special weapons like M79 grenade launchers.]{.underline}

[Prior to 1968, SWAT teams were used sparingly, only in volatile,
high-risk situations like bank robberies or hostage situations. SWAT\'s
first test as a militarized front came when the LAPD used a tank on loan
from the California National Guard on the Southern California Black
Panther Party.]{.underline}

Clip: The intermittent warfare between the Black Panthers and police
erupted today in Los Angeles. There, a group of them barricaded
themselves in their headquarters and fought police with automatic
weapons and hand grenades.

Narrator: [The US Department of State granted the LAPD authorization to
use tear gas and sniper rifles. With national coverage, SWAT grew in
popularity across the US and with other local law enforcement, creating
a demand for military equipment.]{.underline}

[LEAA\'s budget was a total of \$7.5 billion, with a good portion going
towards the militarization of US local law-enforcement agencies. After
nearly a decade of extremely high budgets and spending, LEAA began to
receive criticism because it had not shown success in decreasing crime
rates.]{.underline}

[On April 15, 1982, LEAA was abolished when Congress failed to fund it.
But by that time, SWAT teams and their militaristic approach had already
become the norm.]{.underline}

[In 1986, Ronald Reagan\'s Anti-Drug Abuse Act expanded the use of
no-knock or quick-knock warrants and assistance of the Air Force, Navy,
and Marines in drug-related searches and seizures.]{.underline}

[It allowed for members of SWAT to arrive at suspected locations of
criminal activities and enter without knocking or announcing themselves,
pointing guns at anyone inside.]{.underline}

[They often used diversionary tactics like flash grenades, rendering
their victims deaf and blind. In some cases, individuals believe
they\'re experiencing a home invasion, to which they grab a gun. Like
Jose Guerena, a former US Marine who was suspected of selling marijuana.
What you\'re about to see and hear might upset you. He pulled a gun
because he believed his home was being invaded, and the police shot him
60 times in seven seconds. No drugs were found.]{.underline}

[In the early 1980s, there was on average about 3,000 recorded SWAT
incidents per year. By the mid 1990s, that number grew to about 45,000
SWAT incidents per year. 75.9% were drug raids.]{.underline}

[Of those raids, SWAT officers fired 342 times. They injured 61 and
killed 139 citizens.]{.underline}

[In 1989, George H. W. Bush signed the National Defense Authorization
Act.]{.underline}

[This act allowed for surplus DOD equipment from the Cold War to be
transferred to US law enforcement. Sections 1207 and 1208 allowed for
the following: \"the procurement of services and leasing of equipment\"
and the transfer to federal and state agencies personal property,
\"including small arms and ammunition.\"]{.underline}

[And from those two sections, eight years later, the 1033 program was
born. Under Bill Clinton\'s administration, the use of military surplus
trade continued with the introduction of the Law Enforcement Support
Office, LESO, which enacted US code title 10, section 2576a, also known
as the 1033 program.]{.underline}

[Much like National Defense Authorization Act 1208, the 1033 program
expanded into other areas, including counterterrorism. This line states
that surplus military equipment can be used for counter-drugs and
counterterrorism efforts. This line states that surplus military
equipment is free of charge minus shipping and handling.]{.underline}

[Over \$7.4 billion worth of property has been transferred since the
program\'s inception. More than 8,000 law-enforcement agencies have
enrolled. Items shipped include boots, radios, shields, M16 assault
rifles, tanks, and silencers.]{.underline}

[For every one qualified officer, one M1911 pistol, M16 rifle, or M14
rifle is allocated. For every three officers, a department can get a
Humvee, and every law-enforcement agency has the ability if they apply
to receive one MRAP.]{.underline}

And then, three days after 9/11, George W. Bush signed the Patriot Act.

It created a gray zone where law-enforcement agencies were able to
perform more searches and seizures with access to delayed warrants,
wiretaps, email, and web search surveillance, all in the name of
fighting terrorism. But in reality, the liberties given to police were
often used in drug-related cases. Only 1% of sneak and peek searches in
2010 were terrorism related. 76% were drug related.

[And the United States\' international actions also impacted law
enforcement at home. As a result of an increase and then decrease of US
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan over the years, there\'s been more
military surplus equipment available to law enforcement, creating a
spike in tactical items distributed by the 1033 program.]{.underline}

[The Department of Defense does not provide training for law-enforcement
agencies that receive military weapons. Instead, it\'s left to
recipients to certify their own training each year. Because there is no
federal mandate that police agencies report on SWAT operations, there\'s
no real way to tell or quantify the effect of SWAT-related
incidents.]{.underline}

[In an effort to access the program\'s productivity and safety
protocols, the Government Accountability Office created a fake federal
agency. After acquiring more than 100 items worth over \$1.2 million,
the office recommended a process to implement fraud prevention in
addition to a website that can track the equipment and the agencies it
was sent to.]{.underline}

[Prior to the investigation, there was very little record keeping and
tracking of weapons after transfer. There were several instances where
the agencies did not report lost weapons or disposal of excess
equipment.]{.underline}

Clip: And San Mateo and Napa counties were not the only departments in
the nation to have lost equipment. About 200, in fact, have military
equipment missing at this hour, and that includes, actually, some
Humvees.

Narrator: 184 state and local police departments were suspended from the
1033 program. In 2014, sparked by the murder of Michael Brown, civil
unrest rolled through the streets of Ferguson, Missouri. Americans
watching from home were shocked to see what looked like an army
descending on such a small town.

On January 16, 2015, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order
13688.

Barack Obama: You know, we\'ve seen how militarized gear can sometimes
give people a feeling like there\'s an occupying force as opposed to a
force that\'s part of the community that\'s protecting them and serving
them.

Narrator: [The order prohibited a list of equipment from being
transferred to law enforcement through the 1033 program: tracked armored
vehicles, weaponized aircraft, firearms of .50 caliber or higher,
ammunition of .50 caliber or higher, grenade launchers, bayonets,
camouflage uniforms. That executive order did not last long before being
revoked in 2017 by President Donald Trump.]{.underline}

Jeff Sessions: These restrictions that had been opposed went too far. We
will not put superficial concerns above public safety.

Narrator: [Today, in 2020, in the wake of George Floyd\'s killing,
protesters are being met with militarized police armed with 1033 program
war surplus. No-knock warrants still result in the deaths of innocent
citizens, like 26-year-old emergency medical technician Breonna
Taylor.]{.underline}

[Tear gas is still legal for domestic use on protesters but has been
banned for use in war since 1993. And studies on rubber bullets, like
the ones used here, show that 3% of those injured by rubber bullets died
as a result of their injuries. 15.5% suffered permanent disabilities
like eye loss, and nearly 50% of those who were struck on the head or
neck were killed.]{.underline}

[In the US, law enforcement kills over 900 people a year. Compare that
to Norway, where there have been only four police-related killing since
2002.]{.underline}

[Norway credits these numbers to its face-to-face community-building
approach and believes it has created more trust between citizens and
their police department. And we\'ve seen similar changes
stateside.]{.underline}

[In 2001, a Cincinnati police officer shot and killed 19-year-old
Timothy Thomas after he resisted arrest over minor crimes. After riots
and protests, in fear of more unrest, the city began to reform its
police department in collaboration with the Department of
Justice.]{.underline}

[They standardized procedures, making civilian-officer interactions more
transparent. They also created a training program focused on mental
health.]{.underline}

[The reforms were met with pushback from city officials and a hostile
police union, but the result was a 50% decrease in use of force from
2001 to 2007.]{.underline}

[Data shows that building trust within the community may be a better
solution to saving lives than using military weapons against
them.]{.underline}

### 1033

#### Aff plan leaves surplus weapons that ends in the hand of police officers through the 1033 program

Barrett (Brian, executive editor, news at WIRED, and editor of chief of
Gizmodo, "The Pentagon's Hand-Me-Downs Helped Militarize Police. Here's
How," June 2^nd^ 2020,
https://www.wired.com/story/pentagon-hand-me-downs-militarize-police-1033-program/

THE IMAGES OF this past week are both inescapable and
indelible: [protesters flooding the
streets](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protest-safely-surveillance-digital-privacy/) of
cities across the United States, met by police forces equipped with full
body armor and tactical vehicles that vaguely resemble tanks. [The local
law enforcement responding to even nonviolent protests has often looked
more like the US Armed Forces---and that was before President Donald
Trump deployed an actual [military police
battalion](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/06/01/pentagon-orders-active-duty-military-police-unit-dc-region-amid-protests.html) against
peaceably assembled US citizens in the nation\'s capitol Monday. That's
no accident.]{.underline}

[It's easy enough to buy tactical gear in the US, and the Homeland
Security Grant Program
has [funneled](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/20/police-billions-homeland-security-military-equipment) billions
of dollars to law enforcement agencies to acquire military-grade
equipment. But for decades, a primary driver for why it can be so hard
to tell a National Guard troop from a local cop has been the Department
of Defense itself, through a program that has parceled out everything
from bayonets to grenade launchers to precincts across the
country.]{.underline}

[Created as part of 1997's National Defense Authorization Act, the 1033
program allows the Department of Defense to get rid of excess equipment
by passing it off to local authorities, who only have to pay for the
cost of shipping. (A precursor, the slightly more restrictive 1208
program, began in 1990.) According to the Law Enforcement Support Office
(LESO), which oversees the process, over \$7.4 billion of property has
been transferred since the program's inception; more than 8,000 law
enforcement agencies have enrolled. Much of that inventory is perfectly
ordinary: office equipment, clothing, tools, radios, and so on. But the
haul also includes some of the so-called controlled equipment---rifles,
armored vehicles, and so on---that have helped create such a spectacle
of disproportion.]{.underline}

Those displays are not unique to the current protests against police
brutality, either. [The militarization of the American police, and the
1033 program specifically, began attracting wider scrutiny in 2014,
after [the Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson,
Missouri](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/how-black-lives-matter-uses-social-media-to-fight-the-power/).]{.underline}

Proponents of the 1033 program say that it keeps cities safer.
Detractors say the distribution of controlled items actually increases
police violence. Widely circulated studies have
argued [both](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/pol.20150478) [sides](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168017712885).
But those who have examined the 1033 program in depth more recently
argue that the real problem is that no one knows for sure either way,
because years of lax record-keeping have made a hash of the underlying
data.

"[The federal government doesn't really keep track of a lot of this
equipment that goes to local law enforcement agencies]{.underline},"
says Anna Gunderson, a political scientist at Louisiana State University
who coauthored a 2019 study that examined the effects of the 1033
program on crime rates. "[The agencies themselves are inconsistent in
keeping track. That just makes it really difficult for anyone to try to
learn about the program or study it to try and analyze it, because we
don't have a very clear understanding what kinds of equipment actually
are in the hands of these agencies."]{.underline}

The LESO does maintain [a
spreadsheet](https://www.dla.mil/DispositionServices/Offers/Reutilization/LawEnforcement/PublicInformation/) detailing
to whom it has distributed property over the years. When asked about
complaints of inconsistent records, a spokesperson for the Defense
Logistics Agency, which oversees LESO, noted that the agency changed
accounting systems in 2013 to allow state coordinators and law
enforcement agencies to identify and track what they receive. That
switch, and spotty record-keeping beforehand, has confounded efforts to
understand the impact of a program that has helped transform law
enforcement in America.

"The DLA did not archive active inventories prior to 2014. They also did
not archive information about transfers of equipment and destruction of
controlled equipment during that time. LEAs themselves typically only
retain records for a few years, subject to their own local-level record
keeping requirements," says Kenneth Lowande, a political scientist at
the University of Michigan whose research includes the 1033 program.
"Some of this can never be fixed. You can't re-create records that are
lost."

The issues with 1033 have also run deeper than just contradictory or
incomplete data sets. [The Department of Defense does not provide
training for law enforcement agencies that receive controlled property.
Instead, it's left to recipients to certify their own training each
year. "What programs like 1033 have done is given people the equipment
to carry out operations that are traditionally done by tactical teams
that otherwise would not have been able to obtain it," says Jonathan
Mummolo, a political scientist at Princeton University who focuses on
policing. "That is for sure not always accompanied by extensive
training. There's just a lot of variation in policing standards across
the board."]{.underline}

That seemingly lax oversight has manifested in other troubling ways, as
well. In a 2017 sting operation, the General Accountability
Office [obtained over 100 controlled items from the 1033
program](https://www.wired.com/story/gao-sting-defense-department-weapons/)---including
night-vision goggles and pipe bomb materials---with a total estimated
value of \$1.2 million. All it took was the creation of a fake law
enforcement agency, website, and shipping address. The GAO's fraudulent
application was processed and approved within a week.

The DLA implemented additional controls in the wake of the report, which
focused on the acquisition process for federal law enforcement agencies
rather that state and local. Those steps include a review of each
existing applicant and establishing a point of contact at each federal
agency to vet and approve requests. But the GAO's success in hoodwinking
the agency did not inspire confidence. Nor has it inspired the federal
government to fundamentally reconsider the premise of distributing
controlled equipment to police in the first place.

A year after Ferguson, then president Barack Obama signed an [executive
order](https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/publications/LEEWG_Report_Final.pdf) that
prohibited state and local law enforcement from receiving certain types
of property, like grenade launchers and weaponized aircraft, under the
1033 program, but these restrictions were short-lived:
Trump [lifted](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-executive-order-restoring-state-tribal-local-law-enforcements-access-life-saving-equipment-resources/) them
in 2017. Lowande argues the actual impact of that revocation has been
negligible. Obama's original executive order ultimately only applied to
around 300 departments, he says, and there's no sign in recent DLA
inventories that previously restricted items have been sent out again.
In a working paper currently under review, Lowande finds that the
demilitarization efforts that did take place in those two years showed
"no detectable impact on violent crime or officer safety."

"There is no compelling evidence, right now, that arming LEAs with
military-grade equipment increases or decreases crime," he says.

[Other research into 1033 program, though, paints an alarming picture
about its effect on police activity. \"Our research suggests that
officers with military hardware and mindsets will resort to violence
more quickly and often," says Ryan Welch, a political scientist at the
University of Tampa who coauthored a [2017
study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168017712885) on
the effects of the 1033 program on police violence. "Other research
shows that when governmental responses are violent, dissidents and
protestors are more likely to act violently at the site and in the
future. Of course, that leads to more violence from the government
creating a spiral that is hard to escape." Welch\'s study relied on the
muddy data that researchers have decried, but he says the results have
been replicated using more recent, granular numbers.]{.underline}

[In 2018, Princeton's Mummolo
published [research](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/37/9181) showing
not only that special weapons and tactics teams are deployed more often
in communities of color, but that they on average "provide no detectable
benefits in terms of officer safety or violent crime reduction." Which
is a point that often gets lost: While the high-profile responses to
police brutality demonstrations draw more attention to the 1033 program
and others like it, in many parts of the country its impacts are a
staple of policing.]{.underline}

["We tend to focus on these events when there's massive social unrest
and they're dominating the headlines and we see militarized police come
in, but militarized police are active in this country all the time,"
says Mummolo. "It doesn't take a situation like we're seeing right now
to activate them."]{.underline}

Last summer, the Los Angeles Police Depart­ment (LAPD) became the latest
police depart­ment to take viol­ent action against peace­ful
protest­ers. [Video
foot­age](https://theintercept.com/2021/07/18/transphobes-rally-los-angeles-spa-police-attack-counterprotesters/?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=theintercept&utm_source=twitter) shows
LAPD officers acting less like protect­ors of the peace and more like an
occupy­ing force in a theater of war as they beat already subdued
indi­vidu­als with batons, shot noncom­bat­ive people with so-called
"less-than-lethal" muni­tions,
and [kettled](https://www.gq.com/story/what-is-kettling) protest­ers
before arrest­ing them en masse.

To those famil­iar with the history of poli­cing in the United States,
this beha­vior did not come entirely as a surprise. Some of the
earli­est [iter­a­tions](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10511250500335627?needAccess=true&) of
poli­cing are found in patrols and Night Watches that hunted down runaway
slaves, [both](https://plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/brief-history-slavery-and-origins-american-policing) in
the South and around the coun­try. And law enforce­ment has a long and
shame­ful history of [crack­ing down on
dissent](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/19/the-whole-world-is-watching-chicago-police-riot-vietnam-war-regan),
partic­u­larly when expressed by communit­ies of color. Nonethe­less, it
would be a mistake to ignore the ways in which the more recent
phenomenon of police milit­ar­iz­a­tion has played into the hostil­ity that
some police officers exhibit toward the communit­ies they are inten­ded to
serve.

[The mater­ial milit­ar­iz­a­tion of police has been on an upward traject­ory
since the [pres­id­ency of Ronald
Reagan](https://gould.usc.edu/why/students/orgs/ilj/assets/docs/25-2-Doherty.pdf),
who "\[allowed and encour­aged\] the milit­ary to grant civil­ian law
enforce­ment agen­cies access to milit­ary bases, research, and equip­ment"
 as part of the "War on Drugs." That anti-drug fervor contin­ued into the
1990s, when
Congress [allowed](https://gould.usc.edu/why/students/orgs/ilj/assets/docs/25-2-Doherty.pdf) the
trans­fer of unused Depart­ment of Defense equip­ment to state and local
law enforce­ment for counter-drug activ­it­ies, a meas­ure which was then
replaced with what is now referred to as the "[1033
Program](https://project1033.org/)," named for its estab­lish­ing numbered
section in the 1997 National Defense Author­iz­a­tion Act.]{.underline}

Though these meas­ures were inten­ded strictly to mitig­ate drug
traf­fick­ing, [they resul­ted in an explo­sion of the use of milit­ary
equip­ment [for other
purposes](https://cpj.org/2020/09/when-police-patrol-protests-in-military-gear-journalists-face-a-hostile-reporting-environment/).
We saw this milit­ar­iz­a­tion come to a head [last
summer](https://graphics.reuters.com/MINNEAPOLIS-POLICE/WEAPONS/xegvbybazpq/),
when riot police dressed for combat deployed flash gren­ades, used
mine-resist­ant vehicles to drive through throngs of people, and
surveilled activ­ists from [advanced spy planes, drones, and
heli­copters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/us/politics/george-floyd-protests-surveillance.html) during
the protests follow­ing the murder of George Floyd. It's no wonder that
calls to repeal the 1033 Program and demil­it­ar­ize police have [picked up
steam](https://www.aclu.org/news/civil-liberties/its-past-time-to-end-the-federal-militarization-of-police/) in
civil rights circles and in Congress.]{.underline}

[But it's not enough to see milit­ar­iz­a­tion as simply the use of milit­ary
equip­ment. As Columbia Univer­sity Law Professor Bern­ard Harcourt [points
out](https://www.amazon.com/Counterrevolution-Government-Went-Against-Citizens/dp/1541697286),
along with tanks and night-vision goggles, Amer­ican police in many
cities have impor­ted and adop­ted the mental­ity of the milit­ary, down to
the idea that the resid­ents of the communit­ies where officers patrol are
enemy combatants to be met with force. And it's worth noting which
popu­la­tions are seen as those enemy combatants: left-wing protest­ers
are [much more
likely](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polices-tepid-response-to-the-capitol-breach-wasnt-an-aberration/) to
be subjects of police viol­ence than right-wing protest­ers, who are
often [protec­ted](https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-accused-protecting-violent-blue-lives-matter-marchers-bay-ridge) by
police.]{.underline}

[This devel­op­ment flies in the face of Amer­ic­ans' [long­stand­ing
belief](https://www.californialawreview.org/posse-comitatus-act/) that
police and the milit­ary should be separ­ate. It is an idea that can be
traced back to the
nation's [found­ing](https://newrepublic.com/article/157978/police-violence-george-floyd-constitution),
when Brit­ish soldiers quartered inside colon­ists' homes ransacked rooms
look­ing for evid­ence of treason against the Empire. The prin­ciple is
also embod­ied in the [Posse Comit­atus
Act](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R42659.pdf), which prohib­its the
deploy­ment of the federal armed forces to perform domestic law
enforce­ment activ­it­ies unless expressly author­ized by
Congress.]{.underline}

[The milit­ary has a differ­ent role than the police. As a [Minnesota
National Guards­man told a
reporter](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/national-guard-defense-department-protests/) during
the George Floyd protests, "We're a combat unit not trained for riot
control or safely hand­ling civil­ians in this context. Soldiers up and
down the ranks are scared about hurt­ing someone, and lead­ers are worried
about soldiers' suffer­ing liab­il­ity." Police, on the other hand,
regu­larly come into contact with people whose civil rights they are
required to respect and uphold. This differ­ence in role should be
reflec­ted in a differ­ence of capab­il­it­ies.]{.underline}

[Prevent­ing an "us versus them" mental­ity is all the more import­ant when
police depart­ments across the coun­try have been [infilt­rated by white
suprem­acists](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/new-report-hidden-plain-sight-racism-white-supremacy-and-far-right).
While the over­all percent­age of white suprem­acists in law enforce­ment
is [likely
low](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/hidden-plain-sight-racism-white-supremacy-and-far-right-militancy-law),
incid­ents of white suprem­acy within police forces across the coun­try for
decades [have eroded public
trust](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/law-enforcement-and-the-problem-of-white-supremacy) in
the police, and with good reason: the pres­ence of white suprem­acist
affil­i­ations and views in police depart­ments has been found
to [correl­ate
with](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/hidden-plain-sight-racism-white-supremacy-and-far-right-militancy-law) dispro­por­tion­ate
poli­cing of Black and brown communit­ies as well as more use of force
against those communit­ies.]{.underline}

[Many of the communit­ies that police perceive as "them" are [sorely in
need of social
services](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/how-i-became-police-abolitionist/613540/),
not viol­ent inter­ven­tion. When police bring [snipers to deal with mental
health
crises](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/detroit-police-shoot-and-kill-schizophrenic-man-blame-mental-hospital-for-releasing-him/ar-BB1aKB5x),
for instance, they further damage an already tenu­ous rela­tion­ship
between their depart­ments and their neigh­bor­hoods. As soci­ology
professor and coordin­ator of the Poli­cing and Social Justice Project at
Brook­lyn College Alex
Vitale [writes](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why),
"The altern­at­ive is not more money for police train­ing programs,
hard­ware or over­sight. It is to dramat­ic­ally shrink their func­tion. We
must demand that local politi­cians develop non-police solu­tions to the
prob­lems poor people face."]{.underline}

So, yes, we should demil­it­ar­ize the police because "when all you have is
a hammer, everything looks like a nail." We should ask police to make
mean­ing­ful changes to how they inter­act with civil­ians instead of
allow­ing them to use equip­ment built for war when enga­ging with the
public. But we need to demil­it­ar­ize the police because of
milit­ar­iz­a­tion's pois­on­ous effect on poli­cing culture. Today, the
commonly under­stood duty of police --- to "protect and serve" --- is far
too often replaced by a combat­ive approach.

### Link -- China Cyberattacks

#### Securitization against Chinese cyberattacks based on techno-orientalism treating Chinese cyber as an extension to the "Chinese virus"

**Siu** and Chun **20** (Lok, Associate Professor Asian American and
Asian Diaspora Studies at UC Berkley \*\* PHD in Anthropology from
Stanford University, "Yellow Peril and Techno-orientalism in the Time of
Covid-19: Racialized Contagion, Scientific Espionage, and
Techno-Economic Warfare", October 2020, Journal of Asian American
Studies, Volume 23, Number 3, October 2020, pp. 421-440, DOI: 10.1353)
// Ilake LT🐣

The exemplary case of Huawei brings our [discussion of yellow peril into
the explicit terrain of techno-Orientalism where the idea of the Chinese
techno-virus]{.underline}---[emerging at the nexus of technology,
international trade, and cyber-security]{.underline}---is articulated
through the [racialized fear of Chinese technological
domination]{.underline} achieved purportedly by stealing trade secrets,
engaging unfair trade practices, and enabling Chinese state
surveillance. What the case of Huawei [illustrates is the extension of
the "Chinese virus"]{.underline} trope that already exists in the
domains of public health (as biological pathogen) and research
institutions (scientist-spy) into the realm of everyday consumer
technologies. Our point in discussing Huawei is not to defend it or to
judge its activities. Rather, we want to call attention to the
increasing significance of media/communications technologies as sites of
interstate techno-economic-security struggles (in addition to already
existing corporate surveillance). Toward that end, the Huawei example
clearly shows the entwined issues and discourses of technology,
international trade, and cybersecurity, all of which are filtered
through and constitutive of the racializing techniques of the "Chinese
virus." Between January 2019 and February 2020, the U.S. Department of
Justice filed three indictments against Huawei and its subsidiaries.
That Huawei is the first foreign company of recent memory that is
singled out by the United States for charges related to sanctions
violations, conspiracy to steal trade secrets from American companies
(including source code and wireless technology manuals), and federal
racketeering (including fraud, obstruction of justice, money laundering)
is noteworthy in itself. This last charge of racketeering is used
historically to address organized crime (i.e. mafias) and points to the
U.S. government's intended juridical delegitimization of Huawei as an
irrational institution mired in secrecy and an unlawful global
corporation that cannot be trusted. In response to these allegations,
Huawei accused the Department of Justice of exercising a form of
political persecution and asserted that "\[the charges\] are based
largely on resolved civil disputes from the last twenty years that have
been previously settled, litigated, and in some cases, rejected by
federal judges and juries."31 The case will likely take years to
resolve, but its function will become apparent by the ensuing interstate
trade and diplomatic negotiations between China and the United States.
Meanwhile, the White House and various U.S. state departments have begun
to exert pressure on both domestic institutions and allied nation-states
to end contracts and research collaborations with Huawei. For instance,
the U.S. Department of Commerce in 2019 blacklisted the firm on charges
of intellectual property theft and barred U.S. companies from selling
products to Huawei without federal authorization.32 Also, as discussed
in the above section, the FBI has placed pressure on universities to
increase oversight of Chinese American researchers and to divest from
research collaborations funded by Huawei and other Chinese firms.
Multiple universities, including MIT, Stanford University, and the
University of Illinois, have terminated research partnerships with
Huawei.33 In addition to these domestic pressures, U.S. officials have
asked allied nation-states to cancel any existing contracts with Huawei,
especially ones that involve using the firm's equipment for developing
5G wireless networks. [Cybersecurity serves as the stated rationale,
conjuring the potential of the Chinese Communist Party through its ties
to the firm to engage in cyber surveillance/espionage by intercepting
individual, corporate, and government data flowing through the 5G
wireless networks]{.underline}. According to this logic, the
"[Chinese/Asian contagion" manifest as "Chinese/Asian
espionage]{.underline}" can now be hardwired into the infrastructural
fabric of our telecommunications systems through which data will travel
from our phones, computers, online accounts, and other kinds of
technologies to Chinese companies and, potentially, the Chinese state.
The assertion is that the use of Huawei's equipment will create massive
security vulnerabilities not just to U.S. intelligence but also to
American individuals whose personal information can be captured and used
for endless possibilities of commoditization. It is also argued that
[Chinese technology integration into any Western cyber infrastructure
project "would give China the upper hand in any potential cyber
war]{.underline}."34

### Link -- Diseases

#### [Governments and militaries routinely militarize against disease, offering unique consequences and justifying use of violence to contain it]{.underline}

Christopher **Watterson and** Adam Kamradt-**Scott** 20**15** Fighting
Flu: Securitization and the Military Role in Combating Influenza
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0095327X14567364//CDMoney

[**Militaries** also stand to **make significant contributions to
pandemic response measures,** where their capacity to marshal resources
and expertise can ameliorate civil efforts to contain
outbreaks.]{.underline} The onset of pandemics can rapidly overwhelm
medical facilities, upset logistics and supply chains, interrupt
essential services, and in severe cases lead to the breakdown of public
order.123 The operational self-sufficiency, capacity to rapidly
mobilize, and [independent medical capabilities that are essential to
armed forces will also make them preferred agents for emergency relief
in the event of an influenza pandemic]{.underline},124 particularly
where the requirements of the emergency go beyond the standing
capabilities of the public health sector, or fall outside the usual
remit of such actors, for example in [mollifying civil
disobedience]{.underline}. In addition to their potential contributions
to civil society, militaries also have an interest in building internal
capacity to combat influenza. Historically, [influenza has depleted
military readiness through the incapacitation of soldiers]{.underline},
overwhelming of medical facilities, and disruption of military
operations and logistics. Although advancements in preventative and
palliative medicine have, to a large extent, reduced the threat that
infectious disease poses to modern armies, the contingency of an
influenza pandemic still presents a significant challenge to global
military 158 Armed Forces & Society 42(1) readiness, given the ongoing
threat of novel antigenic shifts and the low rates of influenza
vaccination programs in national armed forces.125 [**Militaries**
therefore **have a strong imperative** **to bring influenza** **into**
their **planning** and applied medicine regimes such that seasonal and
pandemic incidents of influenza are to the greatest extent **managed**
through existing mechanisms of military health **without presenting an
unacceptable burden to readiness.**]{.underline} Beyond the more
pragmatic concerns of military readiness, there also exists an [ethical
obligation on militaries to ensure that the health care needs of their
armed forces are met, whether in times of peace or
conflict]{.underline}. As Harrison observes, ''service-people have come
to demand health care as a right: as part of an implicit bargain between
themselves and the military authorities.''126 Inasmuch as influenza
poses a threat to the personal well-being of soldiers, there is likely
to be an expectation that militaries remain engaged in activities that
will confer a superior measure of protection to those that they have
enlisted into service. Recognizing the stake that modern militaries have
in the fight against pandemic influenza, how then do we reconcile
competing agendas regarding military involvement in public health for
the greatest collective benefit of pandemic influenza preparedness and
response? Arguably an important first step is to acknowledge the long
and distinguished history of military involvement in influenza-related
activities, a small proportion of which this article has sought to
convey. In the context of the United States, where civil--military
cooperation is deep rooted,127 the [**contribution of** the **military
to both domestic and international influenza surveillance and control
efforts appears to be well recognized**]{.underline}. Beyond this,
however, broader acceptance of the fact that militaries can make
substantive contributions to national, regional, or global public health
is often lacking---not only with public health communities but also by
military forces themselves. There is also a genuine need to increase
dialog between the public health and military communities, at both the
national level and the international level. More than this though, the
dialog must be of a particular type---namely, it must enable a greater
understanding and appreciation of the goals and objectives of each
respective group, where they compliment each other, and where they stand
in contrast. **[Tension between these camps routinely arises from a
perceived lack of neutrality of militaries,]{.underline}** particularly
in international engagements where broader geopolitical concerns can
become entangled **[in the business of providing public
health]{.underline}**. Discordant expectations about the remit and
chains of command in preparedness and response measures can also
diminish the efficacy of civil--military responses to disasters,
particularly when such arrangements are constructed on an ad hoc
basis.128 Highlevel joint planning and a mutual recognition of
respective operational strengths will provide some basis for reducing
tensions and identifying which particular public health objectives of
the state will benefit from the engagement of one or both parties.
Concurrent with these efforts, there must also be a concerted attempt to
extract military participation in health efforts from the broader debate
surrounding the securitization of health issues. [Securitization
is]{.underline}, in many respects, merely a Watterson and Kamradt-Scott
159 discursive [tool that policy makers may seek to employ in an attempt
to elevate specific issues, thereby granting them greater importance and
(ideally) obtaining additional resources that may not otherwise
materialize.]{.underline} Importantly, however, as acknowledged by the
Copenhagen School's founders, **[securitization also has several
associated dangers including closing down or severely constraining
public debate, justifying extreme measures, even legitimizing the use of
force]{.underline}**.129 By way of contrast, as this article has sought
to evidence, military participation in health is a legitimate---even
necessary---intervention with a long and distinguished pedigree that has
been repeatedly demonstrated to benefit public health and society more
generally. Therefore, to facilitate a more balanced assessment of the
contributions that militaries can bring to public health, the
distinction between the practice and [implications of the
''militarization'' and ''securitization'' of health needs to be
recognized.]{.underline}

### Cyber

#### Foreign Adversaries are only motivated to develop offensive cyber capabilities because the US did so first.

**Carroll 12/20** Ben Carroll is a writer for Workers World and serves
on the advisory board of the Durham Solidarity Center. "After massive
cyberattack, imperialist U.S. blames Russia --- and China"
https://www.workers.org/2020/12/53520/

[**[The U.S. government is quick to cry foul when targeted by
cyberattacks. But the reality is that the Pentagon and the U.S.
government have pioneered and carried out some of the most vicious and
extensive cyberattacks]{.mark} across the globe**.]{.underline} In 2010,
the U.S. government conducted a cyber attack against an Iranian nuclear
facility, using malware called Stuxnet, which damaged or destroyed
upwards of 1,000 nuclear centrifuges, by some estimates. Iran has long
maintained that its nuclear program is strictly for peaceful purposes of
economic development, not for weapons. In 2013, Chinese research
institutions, technology companies and mobile phone carriers were
targeted by a U.S. hack that mined extensive information from millions
of Chinese people and from higher-level targets. This attack came to
light in a trove of documents from the U.S. National Security Agency
released by whistleblower Edward Snowden. And [**[in 2019, the Russian
electrical grid came under a cyberattack led by the U.S. Cyber
Comman]{.mark}d**, as reported by the New York Times. (June 15, 2019)
[**These are but a few of the numerous instances of cyberattacks carried
out by the U.S. government in** recent years]{.mark}, not to mention
many other ways that the Pentagon has employed technology --- namely by
the extensive use of drone warfare --- to rain terror and destruction
down on people around the world in the quest by the U.S. ruling class to
hold onto power and profit.]{.underline} [Continuing to prop up U.S.
militarism, on Dec. 8, 2020, Congress passed a \$740 billion budget for
the Pentagon]{.underline}. Despite it being vetoed by Trump, Congress is
expected to easily override that veto and authorize this staggering
budget. Congress passed the military budget with near unanimous
consensus from both the Democratic and Republican parties. But for
months they refused to pass meager economic assistance for the tens of
millions of workers and oppressed people struggling to survive in the
current staggering economic crisis. Many millions have lost their jobs
and healthcare, and are now experiencing hunger, the threat of eviction
and loss of their homes, and other severe hardships during the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of the U.S. government is to maximize the
profits of the ruling class, whatever the human cost. It refuses to
respond comprehensively to the desperate needs of people living and
dying within its borders. Whether the recent hacking came from its
imperialist rivals or others, [it is **[clear that U.S. attacks for
profit on people around the world -- through direct military
war]{.mark}** and indirect economic war by sanction -- **[have created
more than enough reasons for the recent historic cyberattack]{.mark}**
on U.S. government and corporate entities.]{.underline}

#### Militaristic Offensive Cyber Operations are both epistemologically and practically flawed, they are prone to be misused due to systemic bias towards offense and crushing the enemy and they result in escalation and fear regardless.

"The Myth of the Cyber Offense: The Case for Restraint"

**[[The rationale behind persistent action---that the best defense is a
good offense---is deeply flawed. In fact, most military and strategic
theory holds that the defense is the superior
posture.]{.underline}]{.mark}**[^49^](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/myth-cyber-offense-case-restraint#endnote-049)
For example, Sun Tzu describes controlling an adversary to make their
actions more predictable, and hence easy to undermine, by baiting them
to attack strong
points.[^50^](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/myth-cyber-offense-case-restraint#endnote-050)
[**[The stronger form of war is a deception-driven defense: confusing an
attacker so that they waste resources attacking strong points that
appear weak.]{.mark}** This parallels cybersecurity scholars Erik
Gartzke and Jon Lindsay's claim that cyberspace is not offense dominant,
but deception
dominant.[^51^](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/myth-cyber-offense-case-restraint#endnote-051)
Rather than persistent action and preemptive strikes on adversary
networks, the United States needs persistent deception and defensive
counterstrikes optimized to undermine adversary planning and
capabilities.]{.underline} Fear and the Security Dilemma [**[New policy
options proposed by Cyber Command]{.mark}** and the Trump administration
**[risk exacerbating fear in other countries and creating a
self-reinforcing spiral of tit-for-tat escalations that risk war even
though each actor feels he is acting defensively]{.mark}**---or, as it
is called in the scholarly literature**[, a security
dilemma.]{.mark}[^52^](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/myth-cyber-offense-case-restraint#endnote-052)
A**s shown above, most cyber operations to date have not resulted in
escalation**[.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The cyber domain has been a world
of spies collecting valuable information and engaging in limited
disruptions that substitute for, as well as complement, more
conventional options. Shifting to a policy of preemptive offensive cyber
warfare risks provoking fear and overreaction in other states and
possibly producing conflict spirals. Even limited-objective cyber
offensive action defined as "defending forward" can be misinterpreted
and lead to inadvertent
escalation.[^53^](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/myth-cyber-offense-case-restraint#endnote-053)
As the historian Cathal Nolan puts it, **["[intrusions into a state's
strategically important networks pose serious risks]{.mark} and are
therefore inherently
threatening."[^54^](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/myth-cyber-offense-case-restraint#endnote-054)]{.underline}**
More worryingly, with a more offensive posture, it will be increasingly
difficult for states to differentiate between cyber espionage and more
damaging degradation
operations.[^55^](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/myth-cyber-offense-case-restraint#endnote-055)
What the United States calls defending forward, China and Russia will
call preemptive strikes. Worse still, this posture will likely lead
great powers to assume all network intrusions, including espionage, are
preparing the environment for follow-on offensive strikes. According to
cybersecurity scholar Ben Buchanan, "in the \[aggressor\] state's own
view, such moves are clearly defensive, merely ensuring that its
military will have the strength and flexibility to meet whatever comes
its way. Yet potential adversaries are unlikely to share this
perspective."[^56^](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/myth-cyber-offense-case-restraint#endnote-056)
The new strategy risks producing a "forever cyber war" prone to
inadvertent escalation because it implies all cyber operations should be
interpreted as escalatory by
adversaries.[^57^](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/myth-cyber-offense-case-restraint#endnote-057)
The Myth of Decisive Cyber Victory **[[There is a tendency in the
military profession, at least in the United States and Europe, to uphold
the concept of decisive battle as central to the Western way of
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**.[^58^](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/myth-cyber-offense-case-restraint#endnote-058)
[**[Often, disruptive technologies]{.mark}**---[from strategic bombers
in the mid-20th century to cyber op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} in the 21st
century---**[are seen as providing decisive offensive advantages in
crises]{.mark}**. In]{.underline} the interwar period between the world
wars, airpower enthusiasts argued that bombers would reliably reach
their targets, forcing political leaders to end hostilities or face the
prospect of destroyed cities and economic
collapse.[^59^](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/myth-cyber-offense-case-restraint#endnote-059)
Yet the search for decisive battle is often an elusive, if not
dangerous, temptation for military planners and policymakers. In a
comparative historical treatment of major 19th- and 20th-century
battles, Nolan argues that "often, war results in something clouded,
neither triumph nor defeat. It is an arena of grey outcomes, partial and
ambiguous resolution of disputes and causes that led to the choice of
force as an instrument of policy in the first

**[By setting up antagonistic blocs, NATO undermined the UN principle of
international co operation. By emphasizing military preparation and
militarism, NATO did not pave the path for peaceful settlement of
differences. of deterrence, the military alliances generated distrust
and insecurity among the nations of the world.]{.underline}** In legal
terms NATO is claimed to be a system of collective self-defense
permitted under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The NATO Treaty does not
invoke Chapter VII; nor is collective self-defense specified under that
chapter. In political terms, NATO was created as an anti-Communist
alliance inspired by the Truman Doctrine of communist containment
through military deterrence and means. However, certain provisions in
the NATO Treaty satisfy some of the criteria of a regional arrangement
under Chapter VII. The NATO Treaty promises to uphold the purposes and
the principles of the UN. Under Article 1, NATO pledges to settle all
disputes peacefully as required under Article 52 of the UN Charter.
[NATO acknowledges the primacy of the Security Council in matters of
international peace and security.]{.underline} **[If the NATO members
were sincere in their commitment to peaceful solutions, they would not
have needed an alliance that is heavily loaded with militarization and
militarism. IF the NATO states were honest about their dedication to
international peace and security, they could have also created the UN
collective security system envisaged in Chapter VII, instead of the
sectarian NATO.]{.underline}** NATO was patterned on the model of the
Rio de Janero Treaty of 1947, which is called a regional arrangement.
Articles 5, 6, 10, and 12 and paragraph 3 in the Preamble of the NATO
treaty define the region as the "North Atlantic area." But then the NATO
members Greece and Turkey are not in the North Atlantic region; besides,
Italy and Portugal were not even members of the UN in 1949, as was
pointed out by the U.S.S.R. on 31 March 1949. [A main argument against
NATO being a regional arrangement in the fact that NATO has been claimed
to be a scheme of collective self-defense, but according to Chapter VII
of the Charter, self-defense is not a subject of regional
arrangement.]{.underline} Legally, a collective self-defense scheme has
certain fundamental differences from a collective security scheme of
regional arrangements. self-defense by definition is protection of, by
and for a particular state or states, and not an enforcement action to
protect international peace and security. As an inherent right ,
self-defense is subjectively determined by the concerned state, whereas
enforcement action under regional arrangement is based on objective
determination by the Security Council. Self-defense, triggered off as
soon as an armed attack on the victim state occurs, is unilateral.
Collective enforcement by regional arrangement is to the based on the
consent of authorization of the Security Council. Under Article 51
self-defense is strictly after-the-fact, i.e., after an armed attack has
occurred. This prohibits aggression rationalized as self defense. But
enforcement action by regional arrangement can be both anticipatory and
after-the-fact. Under a regional arrangement enforcement can be
intra-regional, but collective self-defense is organized against
external forces, not against a member state of the regional alliance.
[Thus the collective self-defense scheme of NATO cannot make NATO a
regional arrangement. Nor can NATO be legitimized under Article 51 as an
approach to collective self-defense, because NATO's scheme is
anticipatory while Article 51 provides for defense only after an armed
attack has occurred. Even is defense preparation is considered allowable
under Article 51, predetermination of a potential enemy is not envisaged
or permitted by Article 51.]{.underline} Further, Articles 3, 4, 5, and
6 of the NATO Treaty imply self-defense against an aggression from
outside the NATO membership. Article 5 of the NATO Treaty refers to
threats to "the territorial integrity, political independence or
sovereignty" of the member states; Articles 5 and 6 mention "armed
attack." And Article 3 talks of resistance to armed attack from outside
the NATO alliance.

#### [NATO's rhetoric of a dangerous Russia creates a security feedback loop of military modernization and unintended consequences leading to conflict]{.underline}

in the North? The Effect of Mutual and Multifaceted Securitization,\"

For example, a [**securitization of NATO** as different and dangerous
**to Russia** **creates** both inner cohesion in the Russian polity and
makes possible a **policy of "military modernization" and a posture of
"defensive deterrence**]{.underline}," but it **[can have unintended
consequences]{.underline}**. It can be taken as a rejection of NATO\'s
self-constituted identity as a legitimate, reliable, security-seeking
actor and [elicit a string of representations of Russia as different and
dangerous on the NATO side.]{.underline}8 Failure to be recognized by
the other on one\'s own preferred terms might not necessarily result in
feelings of inferiority and shame, triggering efforts to reconstruct
one\'s own identity, as Bially Mattern has suggested (2004, 12--13) or
"progressive change" of self to become like the other, as Ringmar (2014)
holds. As Lupovici (2012, 818) notes a collective [actor that
experiences ontological threat]{.underline} [can "redefine the situation
in order to protect identity]{.underline}." "Avoidance," he says,
building on Giddens (1991, 188) "allows an actor facing an ontological
dissonance to revalidate its identity rather than to change it or to
change its behaviour." Lupovici explores the strategy of avoidance in
situations where dissonance is created endogenously, between conflicting
self-identifications and the responses undertaken to offset threats to
these self-identifications within one political entity. Avoidance may
play out differently when the ontological dissonance emerges exogenously
in a dyad of political entities. To reduce the dissonance between the
understanding of self and the explicit identification of one\'s own
political entity by the other as being something different and
dangerous, revalidation of own identity can be achieved through
externalization, by simply returning the negative identification. This
strategy is manifest as a clear pattern in the texts by
Norwegian/Western and Russian leaders studied below. It is hardly
surprising that a collective actor would respond to the non-recognition
implicit in being securitized with externalization in the form of
talking and hitting back instead of undertaking some form of internal
revision. [Responding by mirroring the securitization of your group by
the other party can be rewarding in terms of delineating and maintaining
self-identity, particularly in a time of crisis]{.underline}. To restate
and return to the case in focus: the [non-recognition implicit in
Russia\'s securitization of NATO **can elicit highly antagonistic
representations of Russia from the NATO side, triggering another round
of representations and accusations from the Russian side, and so
on.**]{.underline} Such a [negative spiral of mutual representations and
accusations can be driven further]{.underline} [when the different
non-military issue-areas in which collective political entities engage
also become subject to securitization.]{.underline} While relations
between such entities usually take place on different international
arenas addressing different issue-areas and exhibit a mixed pattern of
friendly and hostile interaction (Jervis 2001, 37; Bially Mattern 2004),
they may become subject to patterned all-encompassing friendly or
**[hostile interaction]{.underline}**. The latter, I propose, can
**[happen]{.underline}** when security concerns take center-stage in
relations, **[through]{.underline}** a **[spillover from mutual
securitization in the military sphere into other arenas of potentially
neutral or friendly interaction, such as trade, culture, or even
diplomacy.]{.underline}**

"**[[US-NATO: More Militarisation, Less Peace for the
World]{.underline}]{.mark}**"

In the context of a preparatory meeting last January, activists from
various organisations gave their views and data on how bad the Atlantic
Alliance, NATO, has been for the world. Jörg Kronauer, a German
journalist, noted that "[**[NATO has never been a good force at
all.]{.mark}** They talk about democracy and human rights, **[how can
you say they stand for democracy and human rights and send aid to Saudi
Arabia]{.mark}**?]{.underline} The journalist recalls that "NATO was
established when the Cold War began. The capitalist countries were
against the Eastern countries and NATO wanted, through brutality and
threats, to suppress these countries". NATO was founded in 1949 with an
alliance of 12 countries and today there are 30 member countries. Many
believed that with the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the
Warsaw Pact (founded in 1955 and dissolved in 1991) NATO would disappear
but this has not been the case as it continues to expand, fueled by
narratives and justifications of supposed threats and the creation of
enemies. It is true that in the early 1990s, the former USSR had a
commitment that the US and NATO would not advance towards its borders:
"Not one centimeter to the East" was the promise made by US Secretary of
State James Baker, but the promise was not kept. Jörg Kronauer recalls
that "in the decades of the Cold War, NATO was simply, and everyone knew
it, an anti-communist organisation". However, he points out, "if NATO
were simply anti-communist, it would have been disbanded after the
collapse of communist forces in the 1990s; but NATO is still used by
Western countries to do their dirty work, to kill, to drop bombs". Fiona
Edwards of the "No Cold War" platform points out that "[[the US and NATO
have left a trail of destruction. The current situation in
Afghanistan,]{.mark} after twenty years of US-led war, **is a great
test. There are [hundreds of thousands of people who have died in this
war,]{.mark}**]{.underline} killed by US forces, and what they have left
there, in these 20 years of war: extreme poverty, it's a humanitarian
disaster". The Aukus Alliance On the other hand, the activist denounces
that "the military pact between the US, Britain and Australia against
China is threatening stability. We are talking about a new Cold War and
it is important to understand that the main priority of the US and US
policy is to take down the Chinese government". ["If we look at the maps
and the maps of military bases around China, we can compare them with
the bases that China has in the rest of the world, and China has zero
military bases in the rest of the world and China is surrounded by
military bases around it.]{.underline} China has zero military assets
around the US and Europe. We're talking about zero versus hundreds of
military bases," says Fiona Edwards. The strategic alliance called AUKUS
(an acronym for Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States) has
been reported in the press as aiming to "defend the shared interests in
the Indo-Pacific" of these governments. The AUKUS Alliance will enable
the Royal Australian Navy to acquire nuclear-powered submarines. "What
we have is a US war against China and China has made it clear that they
don't want a cold war. They don't want a war, hot or cold, and they
don't want a nuclear war, which is a great threat to all of humanity,"
says Fiona Edwards, adding that "China is asking for peace; and what we
need now is for all the resources of humanity to be deployed against
real threats, not imaginary threats. The big threat is pandemics,
climate change is a big threat. Poverty is another real threat. And this
cold war is against the interests of all humanity. NATO responsible for
military spending Ludo De Brabander, a Belgian peace activist from
Vrede, adds that "NATO is responsible for military spending". [He
recalls that when the US and NATO launched their **[campaign in Bosnia,
Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya]{.mark}**, the arms budget went through the
roof. "]{.underline}The combined arms sales of the world's 100 largest
military services companies and arms producers (SIPRI Top 100) were 531
billion in 2020 compared to 300 billion in 2001[[." **"NATO today
accounts for more than half of global military spending, and that
proportion will surely rise in the coming years, Russia's military
spending is 6%, of what NATO spends**]{.mark}, only]{.underline}
slightly higher than that of Germany or the UK, so the confrontational
politics around Ukraine are driving NATO's military budget even higher,"
he points out. The activist recalls that "the coup in Kiev and Russia's
annexation of Crimea were used by NATO to agree at the Wales Summit
(2014) that NATO member states should spend 2% of GDP on their military
apparatus. Twenty per cent of their military expenditure should
henceforth be spent on the purchase of military equipment. Since then,
[**[NATO's military budget has risen]{.mark}** from \$896 billion to
\$1,049 billion **[by the middle of last year, an increase of
15%]{.mark}**]{.underline}", and that "NATO's war industry also
dominates the global market. According to CIPRI, the three NATO member
states, Germany, France and the US increased their share of the arms
market to more than 50 per cent". "[[**In recent years, NATO has
increased tension with Russia and China whom it has called "systemic
rivals**"]{.mark} and this is how the war industry can make huge profits
at the expense of real security and peace, and of human security and
safety," says the Belgian activist. Adding that **[there is not only
increased spending and militarisation of NATO member countries but real
acts of provocation against countries that are declared enemies. In
recent years, NATO aircraft and warships, including nuclear-capable
submarines, have conducted military manoeuvres near the borders of
China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, and even attempted to penetrate the
borders of these countries]{.mark}**. Nuclear weapons Ludo De Brabander
notes that "Rising international tensions are also driving new
investment in nuclear weapons arsenals. According to ICAN, the nuclear
powers invested \$72.9 billion in maintaining and upgrading their
nuclear weapons. The US accounts for half of that and, with France and
the UK included,]{.underline} **[[67 per cent of nuclear weapons
investment is on behalf of NATO countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**". For
Britain's Kate Hudson of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, "NATO is
an alliance with nuclear weapons states. The US, France and the UK have
an estimated 6,000 nuclear weapons in their nuclear arsenals. "[NATO has
continuously reiterated its commitment to being a nuclear alliance. Most
recently, at the heads of state summit in Brussels last year. In
addition to these nuclear arsenals, there are some 150 thermonuclear
gravity bombs in Europe. Basically, these are nuclear weapons that are
released from aeroplanes.]{.underline} They are located in 5 countries:
Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Turkey. And, recently, the
US announced that these weapons, under its nuclear umbrella, are going
to be upgraded to be more usable," Hudson points out. [However, **[there
is strong opposition to the existence of nuclear weapons from]{.mark}
European social movements and also from the [governments of the states
that host them]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} "It is an issue that has been raised
again recently under the new German government with some members of that
government who have committed themselves to a nuclear-free Germany.
Those weapons could be moved to Poland, which led to an immediate
response from Lukashenko offering Russia to bring nuclear weapons into
Belarus, which could potentially be an escalation," says Kate Hudson,
adding that "Russia has made a proposal that all nuclear weapons should
be in the nuclear weapons state, which would mean removing US B 61 bombs
from EU member states, and that is a long-standing demand of the Peace
Movement.]{.underline} The activist recalls from the Non-Proliferation
Treaty that "articles 1 and 2 prohibit the transfer of nuclear weapons
to states that are not nuclear powers. But US nuclear weapons are
located in countries without a nuclear force, making their presence
there illegal".

### Link -- Drones

#### Technological innovation allows cheaper and more effective warfare for Western countries, increasing security and justification for more "efficient" militaristic operations (conclusion is a maybe)

Alex **Harris**, 3-7-20**16**, \"Killing by Remote Control: Western
Countries Relying on Technology in the Military,\" E-International
Relations,
https://www.e-ir.info/2016/03/07/killing-by-remote-control-western-countries-relying-on-technology-in-the-military//CDMoney

In helping to explain the [increasing reliance upon drones in Western
warfare]{.underline}, I first wish to reference the [economic and
technological advantage]{.underline} that [drones bring to the
battlefield]{.underline}**.** Following Hallgarth's argument, the
**[West possesses a large quantity of resources with a clear
technological superiority]{.underline}**. However, what the West lacks
is 'available recruits', where the redundancy of conscription and,
perhaps, public opinion, leaves troop numbers lacking. However, this is
a minor disadvantage, far surpassed by its very superiority in
technology. This might be **[indicative of the West's continued drive to
improve and develop its technological capabilities within
war]{.underline}**. In relation to the economics of drones, for the
resourceful West, the numbers are advantageous. Recent figures place the
cost of a Reaper Drone at around \$10.5 million dollars. In comparison,
one F-22 Fighter Jet is priced at around \$150 million dollars and that
involves a human element on top of the cost. Looking at this statistic
alone, it is not surprising that the [drone]{.underline} has become [an
increasingly relied on weapon of war]{.underline}. Despite this
relatively low cost, one where [America is leading the 'Drones Arms
Race']{.underline}, it has come under criticism. For Singer,
[wars]{.underline} are only morally [permissible if public and legal
channels have offered their approval]{.underline}, believing that "[by
making war costless]{.underline}, it [takes]{.underline} the [public out
of the loop]{.underline} by giving it [no reason to care about the
decision to start a war"]{.underline}\[7\]. While I would suggest this
statement is a little dramatic, it raises an interesting question; what
are the implications if the W[est begins only relying on cheaper
alternatives to conduct its warfare]{.underline}, if indeed, this is a
key factor for the increased reliance on drones? If drones intervene on
humanitarian grounds and save lives, Singer would still disregard such
positive reports as 'crude calculations', [where the **West** was
'**powerful ' enough to save** those innocent **civilians** but
"**only** **at a time and place of its choosing and**, more importantly,
**if the costs were low enough**]{.underline}"\[8\]. It is clear that
the cost-[efficiency of these drones helps to explain the increasing
Western reliance]{.underline}. While I disagree that this is the only
element contributing to its use, citing their precision next as a
factor, Singer's argument is interesting. While war will clearly never
be 'costless', it is an important warning from Singer, highlighting his
concerns if this reliance upon drone strikes continued. Another clear
advantage of the utilisation of drones lies in their
[precision]{.underline}, a mode of warfare that [appeals to 'humane'
western values]{.underline}, where human error is reduced and the risk
of collateral is to be avoided. David Whetham described a scenario where
a drone strike could be effectively utilised. An insurgent leader,
moving from safe-house to safe-house in hostile territory, would be
extremely difficult to apprehend. If the state could surgically 'remove'
that person, with no allied human lives at risk and legal authorisation
granted, this would be a case of a targeted killing. Troops on the
ground would avoid that risk and the legality of the authorised strike
would be undisputed. In our modern 'information age', political
accountability is of importance. For every badly directed missile
hitting a school or a hospital, there will be mobile recording devices
on the ground sending such images around the world over social media
platforms. The western world fights 'humane' wars, governed by rules and
regulations. [Western states believe that drones offer the best
(current) technological advancement to fight these wars]{.underline}.
They allow for precise targeting and they have to be approved through
various legal-politico channels before being granted approval. A common
criticism argues that [civilian casualties are still
present,]{.underline} dismissed by Christine Fair who characterised
these strikes as "the [product of meticulous planning among lawyers and
intelligence officers]{.underline}"\[9\], usually "accomplished with
minimal civilian deaths"\[10\]. An article released in 2010 reported
that drones had now upgraded their weaponry from 100 pound Hellfire
Missiles to 35 pound Scorpion Missiles, possessing smaller blast
radiuses and thus more effective at reducing collateral damage\[11\].
There will [always be civilian casualties within war -- it's a fact of
war]{.underline} -- but it seems convincing that a real advantage of
this technology is in its reduction of collateral damage. In addition,
the restrictions required for authorisation instil a degree of
accountability and its precise form of attack [suits the
fourth-generation mode of warfare that the West fights]{.underline}.
Consequently, the [increased reliance upon drones by the West seems to
represent the form of warfare that the West now wishes to
figh]{.underline}t -- precise, accountable and a reduction in the loss
of both innocent and allied lives.

\*\*\*To conclude, I wish to assert that, despite a [growing reliance
upon the presence of drones in the asymmetrical wars that are being
fought by the Western powers]{.underline}, it would be **[dangerous to
continue to solely rely on technological advances]{.underline}**. To
[gain a lasting political settlement, territory needs to be held and
controlled, with a 'friendly' government instilled and
maintained.]{.underline} This cannot be achieved by technological
advancements alone, an advantage that the West holds over those it seeks
to restrict, but must be achieved by 'boots on the ground'. States have
always relied on technology to gain superiority on the battlefield and
this move towards UAVs is no different. The W[est's increasing reliance
highlights the new precise, efficient and accountable form of warfare
that it now seeks to wage, to distinguish itself from the lawless
'other' it holds in its sights]{.underline}. However, to truly gain
total victory, a heavy human influence is still required on the ground.

#### Drone technology able to give military superiority to Western States -- justifies more violence by rhetoric of 'efficiency'

Upon President [Obama's]{.underline} inauguration into office in 2008,
he [pledged to end the 'war on terror',]{.underline} the [public 'call
to arms']{.underline} that President [Bush]{.underline} first [issued
following the events of 9/11]{.underline}. Instead of concluding the
war, [Obama placed it further within the private sphere]{.underline},
[where combat was now fought 'in the shadows', through special
operations and a substantial increase in the use of robotic and
surveillance technology.]{.underline} This substantial increase can be
demonstrated through empirical data collected by the New America
Foundation. Within Pakistan, the height of Bush's drone strike action
reached 36 in 2008. By 2009, [Obama]{.underline} had [authorised 52
strikes in 2009, reaching an apex of 122 strikes in 2010, with 72 in
2011]{.underline}. From 2004-2015, of 401 total strikes, Obama has been
responsible for authorising 353 strikes (88%) over Bush's 48 strikes
(12%). While I am doubtful that this represents the 'real' total of
strikes that have been conducted (with the NAF stating that the data
came from 'credible news reports'), the [empirical data is useful in
demonstrating an increasing reliance on technological
solutions\[2\].]{.underline} It is my contention that the [growing
reliance on these technological advances highlight the Western
requirement for precision, accountability and a reduction in collateral
damage]{.underline}. While I will reference some of the criticisms
concerning the ethics and morality of this 'technological solution', I
will primarily be focusing on the tactical and strategic advantages that
these weapon systems [offer the West, in waging 'humane' and 'hybrid
warfare'.]{.underline} Firstly, I wish to discuss the role of technology
within war. Is it fair to suggest that warfare now solely employs
technological solutions to military problems? Has the use of drones
changed the nature of warfare that is now fought by the Western
countries? A **[warring state relying on technological solutions to gain
strategic advantages in combat is an idea almost as old as war
itself.]{.underline}** Indeed, it is on the battlefields that these
technologies are first "invented, exploited and then properly
scrutinized by thinkers seeking to rightfully limit their use to morally
justifiable purposes"\[3\]. From the creation of the long-bow to the
repeating machine-gun, technological solutions have always played a
vital role in warfare. As aptly described by Van Creveld, "every single
element is either governed by or at least linked to it"\[4\]. When Van
Creveld refers to a 'single element', he is not just referring to the
act of battle itself but its elements in its entirety, such as
communication, strategy and command. It's convincing and I wish to speak
of technology in the same way, recognizing its presence within all
aspects of warfare. However, despite recognizing the omnipresence of
technology within the elements of war, it cannot be its sole reliant.
The use of technology in war, as concluded by Van Creveld, "often means
there is a price to be paid in terms of deliberating diminishing
efficiency"\[5\] -- a line of argument I will later conclude as a
warning against this 'increasing reliance', as a warning that true
victory cannot yet be individually gained by 'eyes in the sky'. Now, to
turn to drones or UAV's (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), they are also by no
means a recent invention. Their first reported battle-test was said to
have occurred in 1849 when Austria sent unmanned balloon, loaded with
explosives, to attack Venice. A pilotless aerial torpedo was tested
during World War 1 and UAVs were actively used by the US during the
Vietnam War. The War of Attrition, from 1967-1970, was the first
recorded battlefield appearance of UAVs equipped with camera equipment,
for the function of surveillance, a role of the drone that is certainly
established within the popular consciousness today. Now that I have
discussed the use of technology and, more specifically, the history of
UAVs on the battlefield, I wish to briefly summarize the ethical
arguments that are raised, in part due to the efficient lethality of
these weapon systems, namely the 'threshold' argument. This argues that
the **[effectiveness of their drones -- both in cost and in deployment
-- lowers the threshold that normally limits violence within morally
acceptable boundaries]{.underline}**. If it is perceived as a safer and
more politically safe option than deploying troops, critics are
concerned that [drones will serve to exacerbate violence, where the 'fog
of war' is dispersed and the ease at which an insurgent can be
surveilled and then neutralized, concerns critics of its legal and moral
implications.]{.underline} However, this ease is **[praised as precise
and efficient]{.underline}**, indeed referenced in President Obama's
State of the Union Address, expressing his view in regards to Osama Bin
Laden, where "if you have twenty minutes, you do it swiftly and
surely"\[6\]. It is also suggested that these 'strikes from the sky' are
serving to radicalize generation after generation in the Middle East,
where '[dishonourable' killings from a faceless enemy, albeit one with
superior technology associated with the 'West']{.underline}, is acting
as a recruitment tool. However, under Just War theory, [drones are
deemed morally permissible]{.underline}. While it is accepted that they
are capable of great damage, it is deemed permissible due to the
improvements that they offer at the other end of the spectrum, in
prevention and deterrence. Indeed, in 21st century hybrid warfare, where
the enemies are no longer identified through uniforms or emblems, can
[technology]{.underline} such as drones be [justified under this
identification framework, under the support they can offer ground-troops
and the targeting of the disguised guilty hiding among and behind the
general population]{.underline}? Such questions of the morality and
ethics of drone warfare are perhaps more suitable of a different paper
but it is important to make reference to the prevailing narrative
nonetheless.

According to **[democratic peace theory]{.underline}**, **[democracies
do not start wars; only dictatorships do]{.underline}**. A [wholly
democratic world thus would be a world without war]{.underline}. This
was the hope that emerged in the 1990s. With the end of communism, the
expectation, famously expressed by Francis Fukuyama's 1989 article, "The
End of History?," was that the most important parts of the world would
become democratic.2 US supremacy was supposed to ensure that democracy
became the universal political norm. But Russia and China, the leading
communist states of the Cold War era, have not embraced it; nor have
many other centers of world affairs, especially in the Middle East.
Hence, Fukuyama has recently acknowledged that if Russia and China were
driven together, "then you would really be living in a world that was
being dominated by these non-democratic powers...\[which\] really is the
end of the end of history." The argument that democracy is inherently
"peaceful," and dictatorship or autocracy "warlike," is intuitively
attractive. It does not deny that states pursue their own interests; but
it assumes that the interests of democratic states will reflect common
values like human rights, and that those interests will be pursued in a
less bellicose manner (since democratic processes require negotiation of
differences). Democratic governments are accountable to their people,
and the people have an interest in peace, not war. By contrast,
according to this view, rulers and elites in dictatorships are
illegitimate and therefore insecure, which leads them to seek popular
support by whipping up animosity toward foreigners. If democracy
replaced dictatorship everywhere, world peace would follow
automatically. This **[belief rests on two propositions]{.underline}**
that have [been extremely influential in international
relations]{.underline} theory, [even though **they are poorly grounded
theoretically and empirically.**]{.underline} The first is the notion
that a state's external behavior is determined by its domestic
constitution -- a view that ignores the influence the international
system can have on a country's domestic politics. As the American
political scientist Kenneth N. Waltz argued in his 1979 book, The Theory
of International Politics, "international anarchy" conditions the
behavior of states more than the behavior of states creates
international anarchy. Waltz's "world-systems theory" perspective is
particularly useful in an age of globalization. [One must look to the
structure of the international system to "predict" how individual states
will behave, regardless of their domestic constitutions]{.underline}.
"If each state, being stable, strove only for security, and had no
designs on its neighbors, all states would nevertheless remain
insecure," he observed, "[for the means of security for one state are,
in their very existence, the means by which other states are
threatened]{.underline}." [Waltz]{.underline} offered a bracing antidote
to the facile assumption that democratic habits are easily transferable
from one location to another. [Rather than trying to spread democracy,
he suggested that it would be better to try to reduce global
insecurity.]{.underline} Though there is undeniably some correlation
between democratic institutions and peaceful habits, the direction of
causation is disputable. [Was it democracy that made Europe peaceful
after 1945? Or did the US nuclear umbrella, the fixing of borders by the
victors, and Marshall Plan-fueled economic growth finally make it
possible for non-communist Europe to accept democracy as its political
norm?]{.underline} The political scientist Mark E. Pietrzyk contends
that, "[**Only states** **which are** relatively **secure** --
politically, militarily, economically -- can **afford** to have free,
**pluralistic societies**; in the absence of this security, states are
much more likely to adopt, maintain, or revert to centralized, coercive
authority structures."]{.underline} The second proposition is that
democracy is the natural form of the state, which people everywhere will
spontaneously adopt if allowed to. This dubious assumption makes regime
change seem easy, because the sanctioning powers can rely on the
welcoming support of those whose freedom has been repressed and whose
rights have been trampled underfoot. By drawing superficial comparisons
with postwar Germany and Japan, the **[apostles of democratization
grossly underestimate the difficulties of installing democracies in
societies that lack Western constitutional traditions.]{.underline}**
The results of their handiwork can be seen in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya,
Syria, and many African countries. **[Democratic peace theory is, above
all, lazy.]{.underline}** It **[provides an easy explanation for
"warlike" behavior]{.underline}** **[without considering]{.underline}**
the location and **[history of the states involved]{.underline}**. This
[sha**llowness lends itself to overconfidence that a quick dose of
economic sanctions or bombing is all that is needed to cure a
dictatorship of its unfortunate affliction.**]{.underline} In short, the
[idea that democracy is "portable" leads to a gross underestimation of
the military]{.underline}, [economic, and humanitarian costs of trying
to spread democracy]{.underline} to troubled parts of the world. The
**[West has paid a terrible price for such thinking -- and it may be
about to pay again.]{.underline}**

#### **[Democratic Peace Theory is empirically false and attempts by "Liberal Democracies" in justifying warfare against non-democratic/Europeans prove that Western dominance and discrimination are inherent in the thesis]{.underline}**

Rosato, **Sebastian**. no. 4, 20**03** "The Flawed Logic of Democratic
Peace Theory." The American Political Science Review, vol. 97, pp.
585--602, <http://www.jstor.org/stable/3593025//CDMoney>

The historical record indicates that [democracies have failed to adopt
their internal norms of conflict resolution in an international
context.]{.underline} This claim rests, first, on determining what
democratic norms say about the international use of force and, second,
on establishing whether democracies have generally adhered to these
prescriptions. [Liberal democratic norms narrowly circumscribe the range
of situations in which democracies can justify the use of
force]{.underline}. As Doyle (1997,25) notes, "[Liberal wars are only
fought for popular liberal purposes." This does not mean that they will
go to war less often than other kinds of states; it only means that
there are fewer reasons availible to them for waging war.
Democracies]{.underline} are certainly [justified in fighting wars of
self-defense]{.underline}. Locke (1690 1988), for example, argues that
states, like men in the state of nature, have a right to destroy those
who violate their rights to life, liberty, and property (269 -- 72).
There is considerable [disagreement]{.underline} among liberal theorists
[regarding precisely what kinds of actions constitute
self-defense]{.underline}, but repulsing an invasion, preempting an
impending military attack, and fighting in the face of unreasonable
demands all plausibly fall under this heading. Waging war when the other
party is not engaged in threatening behavior does not. In short,
[democracies should only go to war when "their safety and security are
seriously endangered by the expansionist policies of outlaw
states]{.underline}" (Rawls 1999, 90--91). Another justification for the
use force is intervention in the affairs of other states or peoples,
either to prevent blatant human rights violations or to bring about
conditions in which liberal values can take root. For Rawls (1999, 81),
as for many liberals, human rights violators are "to be condemned and in
grave cases may be subjected to forceful sanctions and even to
intervention" (see also Doyle 1997, 31--32, and Owen 1997, 34--35). Mill
(1859) (1984) [extends the scope of intervention, arguing that
"barbarous' nations can be conquered to civilize them for their own
benefit (]{.underline}see also Mehta 1990). However, if external rule
does not ensure freedom and equality, it will be as illiberal as the
system it seeks to replace. Consequently, intervention can only of
conditions in which appropriate principles of justice can be satisfied"
(Beitz 1979, 90). The **[imperialism of Europe's]{.underline}** Great
Powers between 1815 and 1975 **[provides good evidence that liberal
democracies have often waged war for reasons other than self-defense and
the inculcation of liberal values]{.underline}**. Although there were
only a handful of liberal democracies in the international system during
this period, [they were involved in 66 of the 108 wars listed in the
Corelates of War (COW) dataset of extra systemic wars (Singer and Small
1994). OF these 66 wars, 33 were "imperials," fought against previously
independent peoples, and 33 were colonial," waged against existing
colonies.]{.underline} It is [hard to justify the "imperial" wars in
terms of self-defense.]{.underline} Several cases are clear-cut: The
**[democracy faced no immediate threat and conquered simply for profit
or to expand its sphere of influence]{.underline}**. A second set of
cases includes wars waged as a result of imperial competition: [Liberal
democracies conquered]{.underline} non-European peoples in order [to
create buffer]{.underline} states against other empires [or to establish
control over them before another imperial power could move
in.]{.underline} Thus, Britain tried to conquer Afghanistan (1838) in
order to create a buffer state against Russia, and France invaded
Tunisia (1881) for fear of an eventual Italian occupation. Some
commendations describe these wars as defensive because they aimed to
secure sources of the expense of other European powers. There are three
reasons to dispute this assessment. First, there [wars were often
preventive rather than defensive]{.underline}. Second, there was
[frequently a liberal alternative to war]{.underline}. Rather than
impose authoritarian rule, [liberal great powers could have offered
non-European peoples military assistance in case of attack or simply
deterred other imperial powers.]{.underline} [Finally, a **substantial
number of the preventive occupations were a product of competition
between Britain and France, two liberal democracies** that **should have
trusted one another and negotiated in good faith without compromising
the rights of non-Europeans if democratic peace theory is
correct.**]{.underline}

### Link -- Nuclear War 

#### Affs support of binaries is what causes nuclear impacts -- viewpoint promotes separation 

**Falk ND --** (Richard Falk is an international law and relations
scholar who taught at Princeton University for 40 years. "The Nuclear
Challenge: Seventy Years After Hiroshima & Nagasaki: Against Binaries",
*Richardfalk.org*, September 10,
https://richardfalk.org/2015/09/10/the-nuclear-challenge-10-seventy-years-after-hiroshima-nagasaki-against-binaries/)
// TMBL

Perhaps, the most blatant of all binaries bearing on nuclear weapons is
between 'good' and 'evil' nuclear weapons states, which immediately
reminds us of Mahmood Mamdani's devastating critique of the distinction
between 'good' and 'bad' Muslims. \[See Mamdani, Good Muslim, Bad
Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror (2005)\] The
United States and its allies regard themselves as 'good' nuclear weapons
states that the world has no reason to worry about while Iran, North
Korea, and Pakistan are 'evil,' or at best 'irresponsible' or 'insecure'
states that should if at all possible be disallowed to acquire nuclear
weapons. It is this primary binary that provides the moral/political
disguised infrastructure of NPT treaty regime, [which when established
was confined to the P5 of the UN Security Council, which while not
conceived of as 'good' by the West were at least not part of 'the axis
of evil' depicted by George W. Bush during his presidency. In this
series on the nuclear challenge as of 2015, I have myself succumbed to
the 'binary temptation' in at least two respects---distinguishing arms
control from disarmament, and separating nuclear disarmament from
conventional disarmament. Relying on binaries can contribute to a
certain clarity of analysis, leading I believe to useful political
discourse, but it is also misleading unless qualified and transcended.
Dichotomizing choice and c]{.underline}onsequences in these ways can be
especially useful in pointing out weaknesses and pitfalls in
'politically correct' methods of solving societal problems. In this
spirit, I continue to believe it is illuminating to insist on the
critical difference between complete nuclear disarmament as
transformative of the security scene as now embedded in world order and
arms control as a series of more or less helpful reformist moves that
stabilize and manage the role of nuclear weaponry in contemporary
security structures. These arms control moves are made without posing
any challenge to the fundamental distribution of power and authority in
the world, and tend to make such a challenge appear less urgent, and
even of questionable benefit. From this perspective, then, a critique of
the NPT regime as the preeminent stabilizing structure in relation to
[nuclearism seems justified. It provides the basis for setting forth an
argument that the NPT approach is antagonistic, rather than
complementary to denuclearization and disarmament. This is contrary to
the way the NPT regime is generally explained and affirmed, which is as
step toward achieving nuclear disarmament, and an indispensable place
holding measure to reduce the risks of nuclear war. It is true that
inhibiting the spread of nuclear weaponry seems to be in the spirit of
what might be described as horizontal denuclearization, although even
this limited assertion is]{.underline} not without controversy. The
recently deceased Kenneth Waltz with impeccable logical consistency
seemed to believe so deeply in rational decision making as embedded in
the doctrine of deterrence that he favored the spread of nuclear weapons
to additional countries because it would tend to make governments more
cautious, and hence nuclear war less likely. Others, including myself,
are more ambivalent about such an out of the box position, worrying
about any further spread of the bomb, but thinking that only when there
is a sense of a loss of control in the capitals of the nuclear nine will
there arise a sufficient interest in denuclearization as a genuine
political project (as distinct from more or less sincere rhetorical
posturing). Obama's Prague speech in 2009 still seems sincere as of the
time of its delivery, but we need to notice that it lived and died as
rhetoric because it lacked legs, that is, the rhetoric was never
converted into a political project. In contrast, the NPT is definitely a
political project and enjoys strong geopolitical support.

### AT Weapons Go To EDA or Ukraine, That's Good

#### Even if some goes to the EDA, Iraq war proves that most of the weaponry still lands in the hand of domestic police.

**Fan and Lin 22** (Lingzhi and Xiaoy, Journalist for Global Times;
Journalist for Global Times, People's Daily, and Yerepouni Daily News)
"Weapons sent by US and NATO may fall into dark net and even to
terrorists, leading widespread and unbearable cost," Global Times, June
9 2022

Heartless terrorists turned dreadful mercenaries, weapons scattered in a
chaotic battlefield... These disturbing signs showed that a big,
horrible disaster is sprawling in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. \
\
[Executive Director of Europol Catherine De Bolle told German media in
late May that they were very concerned that the military equipment the
West is sending to Ukraine will end up on the black market and in the
hands of terrorists and criminals. \
\]{.underline}
Previous reports show that the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service
(SVR) found the US was stepping up its efforts to recruit members of
international terrorist groups, including extremist organizations, as
mercenaries to fight in Ukraine and take part in sabotage operations
against Russian forces.\
\
After US President Joe Biden formally signed the \$40 billion aid
package to Ukraine, this worry became more pressing. Can the flow of
weapons from NATO and the US to Ukraine be monitored? Is it only a
matter of time before terrorist groups take hold of those weapons? Who
is laughing behind Europe\'s worried back?\
\
[Several experts told the Global Times that it is difficult to control
the flow of weapons on the battlefield. They noted that not only Europe,
which has been deprived of its security autonomy by the US and NATO, but
also the third world countries, will suffer the costs. \]{.underline}
\
[Those who prefer to live by the sword will fall by the sword. While the
military-industrial complex profiteers, it is only a matter of time
before this backfires, experts noted.]{.underline}

Flow of illegal weapons\
\
[Jürgen Stock, the head of Interpol, warned that once the Russia-Ukraine
conflict ends, guns and heavy arms will flood the international
market]{.underline}, according to a Guardian report. \
\
[\"Once the guns fall silent \[in Ukraine\], illegal weapons will come.
We know this from many other instances of conflict. Criminals are even
now, as we speak, focusing on them,\" said Stock, stressing that the
illegal weapons flowing into the criminal market will create a
challenge.]{.underline} \
\
Several days ago, De Bolle expressed the same concern in an interview
with the German newspaper Die Welt am Sonntag. She said [the arms
delivered from the EU to Ukraine could easily fall into the hands of
criminals which would imperil the internal security landscape of the
EU.]{.underline} \
\
[Along with weapons are bloodthirsty criminals. According to the SVR, in
April about 60 ISIS militants, aged 20 to 25, were released from prisons
controlled by Syrian Kurds with the intervention of American
intelligence services. \]{.underline}
\
[They were \"transferred to the US military base of Al-Tanf, located in
Syria near the border with Jordan and Iraq, for combat training with the
aim of a subsequent deployment to Ukraine,\" according to a statement
from the SVR.\
\
Analysts pointed out that the frantic fascist \"dream\" of killing is
the same on both sides of the Atlantic. \
\]{.underline}
The far-right \"white supremacists\" in the US now also threaten
ordinary people\'s lives. The recent spate of mass shootings in the US
has made the possible influx of illegal weapons from Ukraine more even
frightening. \
\
What would it look like, on both sides of the Atlantic, if a large
amount of unregulated weapons flows from Ukraine to extremists around
the world? Regardless of this question, it seems that the US does not
care. \
\
On May 21, during his visit to South Korea, Biden signed into law a \$40
billion aid package for Ukraine. \
\
Previously, the US Senate and House of Representatives had quickly
passed the bill with unusual \"efficiency.\"

A heavy price to bear\
\
What weapons have the US and other NATO countries provided since the
Russia-Ukraine conflict erupted? A June 5 report by Al Jazeera titled
\"Weapons to Ukraine: Which countries have sent what?\" said that US aid
accounts for a significant portion, including 1,400 Stinger
anti-aircraft systems, 5,000 Javelin anti-tank missiles, several
thousand rifles with ammunition, and a range of other equipment.\
\
However, [some of the Western weapons sent as aid to Ukraine are being
sold on the dark net]{.underline}. ASB Military News reported on June 2
that some of the arms the US and NATO donated are being sold to buyers
in the Middle East and North Africa. According to the Pentagon\'s 2021
budget, each Javelin missile costs \$178,000. However, these missiles
are now listed for sale on the dark net for just \$30,000, ASB Military
News revealed.\
\
[\"Many people are taking these weapons and selling them to terrorist
organizations on the black market. As a result, these weapons will be
used in the future to kill people in Europe and other
places,\"]{.underline} US journalist John Mark Dougan confirmed the news
in an interview with the Global Times, saying it is almost impossible to
monitor the circulation of these weapons. Dougan is a former US Marine
who traveled to Ukraine as a reporter after the conflict broke out. \
\
\"The management of weapons on the Russian-Ukrainian battlefield is in a
very chaotic state and the whereabouts of these weapons cannot be traced
at all,\" Li Wei, an expert on national security at the China Institute
of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times.\
\
Li pointed out that the Russian army, as the regular army, has a set of
weapons management processes. On the side of the Ukrainian army, the
situation is more complicated. In addition to the regular army, there is
the Azov Battalion and other militia organizations. \"At the beginning
of the conflict, some weapons were even distributed to civilians,\" he
said.\
\
Li noted that in the process of delivering aid, Western countries just
handed them over to the Ukrainian government, but as these weapons are
funneled into the conflict and their final destination, there lacks the
ability and interest to monitor the situation.\
\
Where might these weapons go in the future?\
\
[Akila al-Taya, an Iraqi security expert, recently told Russian news
agency Sputnik that US weapons currently supplied to Ukraine are likely
to be smuggled to extremists inside or outside Ukraine, as well as to
terrorist groups, including the Islamic State, to arm them or create new
organizations under other names.\]{.underline}
\
[ \"If these weapons are in the hands of terrorist organizations and
criminal gangs, this could strengthen European separatism and spark
internal conflict. Europe would be held accountable for US military
actions and its own mistakes]{.underline},\" He Zhigao, a research
fellow with the Institute of European Studies at the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences (CASS), told the Global Times.\
\
[He noted that the influx of refugees after the Ukraine crisis has
raised the possibility of terrorist attacks, adding that \"the overlap
of the refugee crisis, the influx of weapons, and the threat of
terrorism is a scenario that Europe is extremely unhappy to
foresee.\" ]{.underline}\
\
[\"These episodes of chaos prove that the autonomy of Europe\'s security
has obviously been lost during the Russia-Ukraine conflict,\" Li told
the Global Times. Looking back, whenever Europe has tried to achieve
security autonomy, the US has caused trouble to block the process, with
NATO as a key culprit.\
\
\"Russia tried to improve relations with Europe after the collapse of
the Soviet Union, but in the US\' view, such an improvement could be a
threat to its global hegemony,\" Li said, noting that \"the US wanted to
re-awaken \'Russophobia\' in Europe, and the conflict between Russia and
Ukraine has made the US\' plan perfectly realized.\"\
\]{.underline}
\"For Europe, it is necessary to define and maintain its core interests
more clearly. If they blindly follow the pace of the US, their security
autonomy will be a fantasy, let alone being an independent actor with
global influence,\" Li said.\
\
He believes that Europe should strengthen strategic autonomy and
transfer its security concepts. Europe should also support the role of
the UN in the field of conventional arms control with major powers
including China, He said.\
\
Doomed to be backlashed\
\
[In addition to the deepening anxiety in Europe, frequent gun violence
has hit the US recently. \
\
At least 13 mass shootings occurred in the US over the last weekend,
resulting in 16 deaths and more than 70 injured. So far, there have been
246 mass shootings in the US this year, according to a report by CNN on
June 6.\
\
Scattering guns in foreign countries while being unable to ban guns
domestically, the US\' practice at home and abroad seems to be linked by
a \"dark line.\"\
\
\"The dark line shows that some people want to see the consequences of
the proliferation of guns,\" Zhang Yifei, an assistant research fellow
with the Institute of American Studies of the CASS, told the Global
Times, highlighting that by \"selling guns globally and not banning guns
at home, the biggest winner would be the military-industrial complex of
the US.\"\
\]{.underline}
The American political magazine \"Jacobin\" recently published an
article indicating that it is difficult to say how much of the \$40
billion in US aid will ultimately go directly to Ukraine. But one thing
is clear. For arms manufacturers, what is happening in Ukraine is a
\"bonanza.\"\
\
Meanwhile, sending a mixed bag of mercenaries into the battlefield seems
like the last piece of the puzzle to fully implement the whole plan.\
\
Just as De Bolle assessed, \"people who are going to fight in Ukraine do
not represent a homogeneous group but rather adhere to different
ideologies.\"\
\
[Zhang said that the biggest hidden danger of US\' approach is that
those who hold dollars and American weapons must be pro-US. \"Those who
gather with a common interest will naturally disperse when their
interests are exhausted. Therefore, backlash will be a sure outcome for
the US,\" he said.\
\
\"The US is ready to use any means to achieve its geopolitical goals,
not excluding sponsoring international terrorist groups,\" the SVR
said.\
\
The Global Times found that the definition of terrorist support in the
UN\'s International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of
Terrorism, almost \"fits perfectly\" with the behavior displayed by the
US, and ironically, the US is also party to the convention.\
\
\"As a hegemonic country, the US often defines \'terrorism\'
unilaterally,\" Li said, noting that \"in the eyes of the US, whether it
is \'supporting terrorism\' is not defined by the UN, but only by the
US\' standards.\"\
\
But Al Qaeda, which was responsible for the 9/11 attacks, was created
with US funding. Therefore, the US is a country that supports
terrorists, Li concluded.]{.underline}

### AT Perm Do Both

#### Perm fails -- aff diverts the discussion from the demilitarization of the police and coops the movement

**Phillips 18** (Scott, Professor at the State University of New York
College at Buffalo in the department of criminal justice, Police
Militarization: Understanding the Perspectives of Police Chiefs,
Administrators, and Tactical Officers (1^st^ ed), Routledge, published
in New York, May 30 2018)

[The extensive media coverage over several days of the police tactical
operation in Ferguson, and the Senate hearings examining the federal
governments funding programs for police agencies, might portend
substantive changes in policing and how they are organized.]{.underline}
At the very least changes in tactical units, and how or when they are
deployed, would be expected. [Past research indicated, however, that
unless this policing issue consistently remained in the spotlight for a
period of time, the images of militarized police officers would simply
fade from the public's memory. The police might still enact minor
symbolic adjustments in their policies or procedures, but whatever
institutional status quo exists in policing would be maintained. The
disruption in society between the public and the police would eventually
return to its usual condition of quasi-stable equilibrium. The results
of the survey data collected at the National Academy in 2015
demonstrated that, for the most part, this occurred in many American
police agencies. Respondents reported that their agency continue to
utilize tactical units as they have in the past. While there were some
minor modifications in how these units are used, or the policies
associated with them, the police chief and tactical officer interviews
showed that these changes may occur for reasons contrary to the
"organizational survival" that is characteristic of some organizational
change (]{.underline}Meyer & Rowan, 1977). The chiefs and tactical
officers argued that the components of militarization are merely tools
that are occasionally required as part of policing's role in society.
[Policing sees the existence of tactical units in law enforcement as
perfectly reasonable. It was illuminating, however, to hear many of
these chiefs and tactical officers articulate that sometimes "we are our
own worst enemy." They are aware that appearances matter, and that
tactical units should be used in a judicious manner. These are the areas
of change that were found in the surveys and interviews: a reduction in
the use of tactical units for some types of warrants, keeping armored
vehicles out of sight when they are not needed, doing a better job with
transparency, and questioning the need for tactical units in some police
agencies. The chiefs and tactical officers are unwilling, however, to
expose themselves, their officers, or citizens to danger when handling
the tasks expected of the public]{.underline}

**Lawrence and O'Brien** 21 (Charlotte and Cyrus, special assistance for

End", May 12 2021,
https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/federal-militarization-of-law-enforcement-must-end)

In addition to our examination of the potential impact of the Obama
reforms on the actual equipment provided to law enforcement agencies, we
also reviewed the existing empirical research on the stated value of
providing such equipment through the 1033 program. Defenses of 1033
typically put forth the arguments that the program
makes [officers](http://www.napo.org/files/8915/4723/8241/NAPO_LE_Priorities_Position_Paper_Trump_2016.pdf) [safer](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-114hres559ih/pdf/BILLS-114hres559ih.pdf) and [saves
taxpayer
dollars](https://www.dla.mil/DispositionServices/Offers/Reutilization/LawEnforcement/ProgramFAQs.aspx).

[Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions]{.underline}, for
instance, [[defended the program by
saying](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-sessions-delivers-remarks-63rd-biennial-conference-national-fraternal),
"Studies have shown this equipment reduces crime rates]{.underline},
reduces the number of assaults against police officers, and reduces the
number of complaints against police officers."

[The actual data, however, tell quite a different story, and the studies
Sessions touted have since been debunked. In 2020, political science
Professor Anna Gunderson and a team of
scholars [revisited](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00995-5) the
methodology and evidence behind those studies and detailed a number of
fundamental methodological flaws, including that most such studies were
inadequately granular to connect 1033 equipment to affected
communities.]{.underline}

[Gunderson's team found that both studies cited by Sessions conducted
their analyses entirely at the county level, comparing crime rates and
assaults against officers to the aggregate amount of 1033 equipment
transferred to that county. Because counties are often very large,
including a number of distinct law enforcement agencies with distinct
jurisdictions, an increase in 1033 equipment in one part of the county
might happen to correspond with a decrease in crime in another, even
though no causal effect is likely. Conducting an analysis themselves
using agency-level data correctly, the team found no effect between 1033
transfers and decreased crime.]{.underline}

[Another [peer-reviewed
study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00986-6) corroborated
this finding, determining that receiving militarized vehicles had no
impact on either crime rates or officer casualties. This study was
particularly powerful because it took advantage of the natural
experiment created in 2015 when certain types of equipment were recalled
by the E.O. but others were left in circulation. Kenneth Lowande, the
study's author, found no "downside risks" of federal reforms to
demilitarize police.]{.underline}

#### **Militarism is entrenched in the Liberal Order, we must abolish the military industrial complex and the police institution**

Despite the different political orientations which converge on the idea
of militarization, it is notable how they all rely on a particular
narrative about the nostalgic image of the 'bobby on the beat' or '
Officer Friendly' being replaced by camouflage wearing brutes. [Such
imagery suggests that militarization is a problem because of its
excessiveness]{.underline} (doors kicked in, armoured vehicles on the
streets, officers faces hidden behind threatening helmets) -- [the
implication being that more 'ordinary forms' of policing are warranted
as long as it does not become excessive ([Napper & Kaba
2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).
But what is often absent is that the 'ordinary' history of modern police
institutions is itself a history of state repression, economic
exploitation and structural racism. But even more importantly, police
power's intimate links with military power is in no way new or
aberrational. As this article will stress, war and policing continually
overlap and intertwine. This crucial relationship is often downplayed or
completely omitted within much of the militarization literature. For
example, much of the coverage of Ferguson focused on the newness of
Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) Teams and no-knock warrants,
frequently neglecting how these have historically been used against
people of colour -- 'for blacks, the war on terror hasn't come home.
It's always been here' ([Napper & Kaba
2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).
Correspondingly, tactics and expertise from imperial warfare have long
fed into domestic policing in the United States -- for instance, August
Vollmer drew extensively on first-hand experience in brutal
counter-insurgency in the Philippines, while 'modernising' police work
in the early 20th century ([Schrader
2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).]{.underline}

But the problem with the militarization concept is not just conceptual,
but political. [The constant reiteration of a narrative in which the
norms of policing are being superseded by aggressive new tactics and
technologies rests on the assumption that there is a politically neutral
and sociologically unbiased ideal of police which must be returned too.
This is obvious in the case of some commentary: While focusing on the
evils of the state, right libertarian commentaries avoid the central
role of police power and violence in the fabrication of capitalist
social relations -- a gymnastics to be expected of a political ideology,
which is based on critiquing state power while promoting unrestricted
power for capital and private property]{.underline} (social relations
that have historically been forged and protected by police power). [But
even more centrist liberal positions criticize excessiveness while
nonetheless accepting the police as a fundamentally beneficent
institution]{.underline} -- such as the [ACLU
(2014)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569) report
which suggests that the problem with militarization is that it distracts
the police from their proper job. [Even many radicals have
problematically accepted the police mandate as one of 'protecting and
serving'; hence, the institution itself must be extricated from the bad
elements of violence and abuse. When left of centre and even radical
scholarly critique and alternative media accounts start to mirror
critiques coming from mainstream media, state officials, and right-wing
think tanks, then perhaps it is time to revisit the utility and force of
normalized scholarly concepts. The fact that the mainstream media echoes
the 'militarization of the police' mantra so easily and frequently
should be a cause of concern for critical theory. In particular, the
prominence of right libertarians highlights how the police
militarization concept doesn't entail an accompanying critique of the
relation between capital and the police institution.]{.underline}

### AT War and Police Are Separate

#### **War and police power are intricately connected to preserve the State's order**

**McMichael 16** (Christopher, PhD in Politics from Rhodes University,
research include organized crime, Libertarian Marxism, and Fascism,
"Pacification and Police: A critique of the Police Militarization
Thesis," November 29 2016,
https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)

In an interview, South African police commander, Jeremy Vearey ([Amandla
Magazine
2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)),
responded to a question on the apparent 'remilitarization' of the police
by arguing that

Firstly let me just demythologise for you. The police never
demilitarised and remilitarised through the sloganeering of someone.
Never. Never. The structure in terms of the military tradition of
instruction was always there. A militaristic way of doing tactical
planning was always there. Do you understand the military way of
planning? You firstly see those on the other side as an adversary.

In this article, we have worked towards the beginning of a wider
demythologizing of the concept of 'police militarization'. In [our
analysis, the historical conjunction between the military and the
police, the 'tradition' as described in the above quote, is too strong
to describe recent developments across the world as a disturbing new
trend. And this is not just a past facet of policing but carries on into
the present in capitalist democracies. Our concern then is not that the
'militarization thesis' does not describe real phenomena, but that it
relies on an overstated and unquestioned distinction between war and
police. This conceptual separation focuses too much on differences
between the different coercive wings of the state, which disguises how
social war and conflict is central to the logic of 'internal' or
'domestic' policing. War power and police power are best thought as not
opposites, but as being always together. Indeed, the ubiquity of the
militarization thesis may prevent more radical and comprehensive
thinking about the connections of the police institution to power,
violence and authority. Instead of focusing on the question of the
divides between the police and military, we should ask if state violence
and repression is any less problematic and traumatic and wrong if the
officer was dressed in 'non-military' uniforms (is there such a thing as
a non-militarized uniform?). Put another way, would the latter example
be any more illegitimate and unjust? We are not convinced. Both the iron
fist and the velvet glove, we suggest, have to be seen in conjunction,
on a continuum of police power, where coercion and consent are always
already together: the point being, the problem that we must grapple with
is the way the state claims the right in the first place to actually
arrest, kill or maim any subject, abroad and domestically, in the name
of 'security', by which we mean its own narrow, bloody interests --
repressive killing and smiling faces in uniform that are at once enacted
as projects of pacification so that capitalist order survives and
thrives.]{.underline}

A Genealogy of the Rebalance: Geopolitics, Postcolonialism, and the
Politics of Identity

Logan, Swaine, Ross and others examine the US rebalance to the Asia
Pacific in an unproblematic world in which the United States is
responding to a selfevidently rising China. Yet these [actors are not
self-evident or unproblematic]{.underline}. Their
**[[realities]{.underline}]{.mark}** (as threatening, benevolent,
cooperative and so on) [**[are subjectively defined, and]{.mark}
socially and imaginatively [constructed]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Like the
world they inhabit [[they are discursively spacialised]{.mark} or
geo-graphed]{.underline}.12 [The [Asia]{.mark} Pacific for example [was
imagined into existence]{.mark} as recently as the 1970s,]{.underline}
through the agglomeration of East and South East Asia.13 [[Peoples and
places]{.underline}]{.mark}, moreover, [[are Othered]{.mark} from
understandings of the self and for the self, [with **China historically
existing in uncivilised,** ]{.mark}**idealised, [and anachronistic
forms]{.mark}**]{.underline}, among others, [[from the]{.mark} vantage
point of the necessarily [more 'civilised']{.mark}, 'Enlightened',
'technological' **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}.14
[[This makes]{.mark} the **[relations]{.mark}hip [between self and Other
inherently co-constitutive]{.mark}**[; "identity is constituted in
relation to difference]{.mark} and \[d\]ifference is constituted in
relation to identity".]{.underline} 15

The [**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates' contemporary geographical
[claims]{.mark} to the Asia Pacific]{.underline}, then, like all claims,
[are geopolitical because they [inscribe Others with]{.mark} [meanings
which determine how they should be dealt]{.mark}]{.underline}.16
**[[Discourse is]{.mark} thus not simply descriptive but
[performative]{.mark} in that it produces the effects that it
names]{.underline}**,17 [[fabricating]{.mark} global [territories as
sites of interest and]{.mark} material [power]{.mark}]{.underline}.
"Although often assumed to be innocent. . . geography \[is\]. . . a
product of histories of struggle between competing authorities over the
power to organize, occupy and administer space". 18

[In asking 'how' the rebalance is being enabled in its current form,
[the claim]{.mark} here **[is not]{.mark} [that direct causal lines can
be convincingly drawn]{.mark}** between selected discourses and the
implementation of policy.]{.underline} As Doty observes, the
explanations of why questions are incomplete because they tend to take
for granted the possibility that particular courses of action can
happen, by presupposing the backgrounds of discursive meaning so central
to that process. [[Asking 'how' is]{.mark} thus [to examine how]{.mark}
certain [meanings are produced and attached]{.mark} to social subjects,
[creating **discursive environments within which practices are**]{.mark}
**made [possible and others]{.mark} are
[precluded]{.mark}**]{.underline}.19 [[The aim]{.mark} here then [is to
expose]{.mark} the discursive [conditions which make]{.mark}
**ostensibly [problematic or contradictory policies]{.mark} around the
rebalance [possible]{.mark}**]{.underline} and which, as noted above,
more traditional paradigms have difficulty explaining, through an
analysis of the political history of the production of truth and
knowledge about the 'realities' of China, the United States, India, and
so on. [[It is to undermine]{.mark} the [problematic
self-evidences]{.mark} of the existing literature by revealing how
rituals of power arise, take shape, gain importance, and affect
contemporary politics.]{.underline}20 In tracing the genealogy of the
rebalance, then, the expectation is not to locate its physical 'origin'
in the rise of China, the Cold War or elsewhere. It [is to explore the
constitution of its knowledges through a 'history of the present in
terms of its past', to show how 'the present has become logically
possible'.]{.underline} 21

Community (Lauri, Strategic Frame Analysis & Policy Making: Where Does
SFA Fit into our Strategic Plan?, FrameWorks Institute, Issue 18)

From time-to-time [after]{.underline} a presentation on strategic
[[frame analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}, a [group will ask how to apply
this information to achieve]{.underline} their primary task of
[**passing legislation**, advancing a policy at the legislative level,
convincing]{.underline} a targeted group of [the public that a
policy]{.underline} position [should be supported]{.underline}, or
creating a communications campaign to promote a specific policy
position. This section is presented in an effort to ground the art and
science of framing a message in the larger strategy and tactics that
your organization must undertake to advance its public policy
resolutions. The key point we hope to advance is that Strategic [Frame
Analysis]{.underline} (SFA) [[is a key **building block in**]{.mark}
**the [policy making]{.mark} process**]{.underline} [and every
activity]{.underline} that you [undertake in pursuit of
policy-making]{.underline}. Used effectively, SFA can become the
foundation upon which your organization builds its policy advocacy
strategy. In order to not distract us from our primary goal we will use
a simplified model of the public policy process. This will allow us to
more clearly demonstrate the benefits of SFA. In this case it is not the
steps of the policy process or the model that we want to emphasize but
the role of SFA in the process. Accordingly, the use of a standard model
of policy making allows us to deconstruct the process indicating where
SFA fits in each step of the policy model. Let\'s look at the phases of
the policy making process as traditionally identified in the policy
literature. Problem identification/gaining agenda status Policy
Formulation and adoption Policy Implementation Policy
Evaluation/adjustment/termination In order to illuminate the
contribution of SFA to policymaking, we will first discuss policy making
in general, presenting a normative view of the process. We will then
shift to a definition that more closely matches the objectives of SFA.
Next we will quickly review each policy making phase, culminating with
an emphasis on the first phase, where SFA plays such a vital role. We
will use examples from public health throughout this analysis. We do
this for the following reason. Health outcomes are determined by a wide
variety of factors that range in nature from individual behavior to
medical care to socioeconomic factors. Accordingly, [the decision making
process involved in **naming the**]{.underline} health [**problem**, and
selecting a policy solution]{.underline} and intervention provides us
with excellent examples to use in exploring how SFA interacts with the
public policy process. Thus, it is by focusing on public health issues,
we believe, that this analysis can best realize its\' goal of helping
you discern why SFA needs to be interlaced into your policy efforts.
Policy Making Typically, policy making is described as an assembly line
of the elements required to make policy: first the issue is placed on
the agenda and the problem is defined; next the executive branches of
government objectively examine alternative solutions based upon factual
data, then select and refine them; then the executive agencies implement
the solutions while interest groups often challenge the actions through
the judicial branch; and sometimes the policy is evaluated and revised
or scrapped. However, scholars of the policy process such as Deborah
Stone say that this model fails to portray the essence of policy making
which she describes as \"the struggle over ideas\" \[2002\]. Ideas are a
medium of exchange and a mode of influence even more powerful than
money, votes and guns. Shared meanings motivate people to action and
meld individual striving into collective action. **[[Ideas are at the
center of]{.mark} all [political conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[Policymaking]{.underline}, in turn, [is a]{.underline} constant
[struggle over]{.underline} the criteria for
[classification]{.underline}; the boundaries of categories, and the
definition of ideals that guide the way people behave \[Stone, 2002,
11\]. Using Stone\'s image of policymaking matched against the purpose
and objectives of SFA, we can begin to see the importance of framing and
how it applies broadly at every level of the policy making process. We
have said that **[[framing]{.underline}]{.mark}** is a communications
tool that [transmits]{.underline} conceptual [constructs able to [tap
into]{.mark} people\'s]{.underline} deeply held values and
[[beliefs]{.underline}]{.mark}. We have also tried to indicate that
[behind policymaking there is a contest over conflicting
conceptions]{.underline} of the policy [based on]{.underline} equally
plausible [values]{.underline} or ideas. [The question]{.underline} at
each step of the process then [becomes: [what **frame**
transmits]{.mark}]{.underline} the policy with [[concepts that
represent]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[values]{.underline}]{.mark} and
worldviews of the public, policymakers and other key groups that [you
need [to persuade]{.mark}]{.underline}? Accordingly, **[[framing is the
key mechanism that animates the policy process]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
For example, the second step in policymaking is policy formulation and
adoption. In this step, elected officials, house or senate committees,
or the President\'s cabinet identify, evaluate and select from among
alternative policy solutions. A rational, generally accepted view of
decision-making based on reason requires the identification of
objectives, the prediction of the consequences of alternative courses of
action, and finally the evaluation of the possible consequences of each
alternative. However, adhering to the definition of policymaking as a
struggle over values and ideas, we can see that a rational step-by-step
method for policy formulation based on objectivity, facts and reason is
not accurate. [Humans use]{.underline} models, [metaphors]{.underline}
and other techniques [to impose structure on the world]{.underline} and
to reduce considerations. We use stories and exclude stories as we seek
order. Policy formulation as a part of [[policy making
is]{.underline}]{.mark}, once again, [nothing more than]{.underline}
reasoning by [analogy, category and metaphor where those
involved]{.underline}, based on their values and views, [[strategically
select]{.underline}]{.mark} the [data]{.underline}, facts [and
[information that will be most persuasive]{.mark}]{.underline} in
getting others to see a situation as one thing rather than another. A
good example of framing in relation to the description of health
problems and the formulation of public health policy is Nurit Guttman\'s
\[2000\] explanation of the role of values that underlie various health
interventions. Guttman explains that public [[health interventions are
not]{.mark} always [chosen]{.mark} [because they are effective but
because]{.mark} they have [a]{.mark} stronger [link to]{.mark} certain
[social values]{.mark}]{.underline} over others \[2000\]. Health
education strategies targeting individuals with persuasive techniques
raise the issue of individual autonomy and privacy because they reduce
the ability of individuals to freely choose among options \[Guttman,
2000\]. On the other hand, regulatory strategies restricting the
marketplace or protecting the environment draw on the values of justice
and equity and the requirement to provide people an opportunity to live
in environments that promote health and minimize risk \[Guttman, 2000\].
Thus the regulatory restrictive health intervention is inherently
associated with the values of self-actualization and the promotion of
the public good \[Guttman, 2000\]. Various methods or strategies can be
employed for the purpose of achieving the goals of a public health
communication intervention. [[Strategies]{.underline}]{.mark} may
[[include]{.mark} the [use of fear arousal appeals]{.mark},]{.underline}
asking individuals to put social pressure on others, or teaching people
skills such as the use of self-monitoring devices...Values clearly play
a central role in the choice and application of such
strategies...Questions about the morality of coercion, manipulation,
deception, persuasion... typically involve a conflict between the values
of individual freedom and self-determination, on the one hand and such
values as social welfare, economic progress, or equal opportunity on the
other hand \[p. 80\]. Milio, \[1981\] explains another frame and related
underlying values to describe the selection and use of particular public
health strategies and policies. The obligation of health policy, if it
is to serve the health interests of the public, does not extend to
assuring every individual the attainment of personally defined
\"health\". In a democratic society that seeks at least internal
equanimity, if not humanness and social justice, the responsibility of
government is to establish environments that make possible an attainable
level of health for the total population. This responsibility includes
the assurance of environmental circumstances that do not impose more
risks to health for some segments of the population than for others, for
such inequality of risk would doom some groups of people- regardless of
their choice- to a reduction in opportunities to develop their
capacities \[Milio, 1981, p.5\]. The key point is that, while
[policymaking]{.underline} is a process, it [is]{.underline} also [a
human endeavor]{.underline} and as such it is not based on objective and
neutral standards. [Behind every step in the policy process there is a
contest over equally plausible conceptions of the same abstract goal or
value]{.underline} \[Stone, 2002\]. Remember, those participating in
policymaking are also driven by their belief systems, and ideology.
These values and ideologies precede and shape the decisions along every
step of the policy process. Steps in Policymaking Now let\'s take a look
at how framing plays a role in each step of the process. We will begin
with step two in the policy making process, leaving the first step for
closer examination later. Policy Formulation and adoption occurs if an
issue achieves agenda status. [[Policy]{.underline}]{.mark} formulation
[[involves]{.underline} **[analyzing]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[policy]{.mark} goals and solutions]{.underline}**, the creation or
identification of alternative recommendations to resolve or address the
identified public problem, and the final selection of a policy. The U.S.
Surgeon General, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and most
public health experts support exchanging clean needles for used ones as
a way to reduce the spread of H.I.V. infections. New Jersey- a state
with more than 9,000 orphans who lost their mothers to AIDS, 26,000
people with AIDS, the nation\'s third highest rate of intravenous HIV
infection and the nation\'s highest rate of infection among women and
children- not only refuses to pay for needles, it used under cover
police to arrest those distributing clean needles to prevent AIDS
activists from violating the state ban on distributing syringes
\[Clemons and McBeth, 2002.\]. Former Governor Christine Todd Whitman
(R) was adamantly opposed to needle giveaways, claiming it sent the
wrong message to children about drug use. Former President Bill Clinton
(D) who admitted the benefits of a needle exchange program -also failed
to support the effort due to pressure from the then Republican majority
in Congress. \[Clemons and McBeth, 2002.\]. AIDS activist lost this war
of ideas that occurred at the policy formulation stage of the process.
Possible policy solutions considered were increased sex education in
schools; education about and free distribution of condoms; and the
distribution of needles to IV drug users \[Clemons and McBeth, 2002.\].
Facts, reason and objectivity should have induced the elected officials
to select a policy of needle exchange. However, these policies invoked a
series of images and ideas antithetical to the values of powerful groups
in the country such as the religious right \[Clemons and McBeth,
2002.\]. These same groups then framed the policy solutions in such a
manner as to make them \"about\" the behaviors they recognize - illegal
drug use, illicit sex, and addiction -as opposed to the prevention of
HIV and the death of women and children. [The framing of the problem
limited the policy options]{.underline}. Policy Implementation occurs
within organizations, typically administrative bureaucracies, directed
to carry out adopted polices. Occurring at the national, state and local
levels, implementation begins once a policy has been legalized through a
legislative act or a mandate from an official with authority to set
policy. Administrators make decisions about how to deploy resources,
human and financial, to actualize a policy. [The war of
ideas]{.underline} and values [continues to play out]{.underline} even
at this level [because [administrators must define and put into
operation key terms]{.mark}]{.underline} and ideas in the legislative
policy. [**[There is often]{.mark} great [disparity between]{.mark} the
[intentions of a policy and how it is carried out. The outcome will be
affected by how the policy is interpreted]{.mark}**, the values,
ideologies, and views of the administrators, and the resources available
and selected to implement the policy. Consider]{.underline} the national
[policy that over hauled]{.underline} the [welfare]{.underline} program
during the Clinton administration. [The phrase
\"welfare-to-work\"]{.underline} was termed. The President\'s
administration made a great effort to [frame]{.underline} the
[legislation as a means to transition from welfare into jobs that
allowed the recipient to establish a means of livelihood]{.underline}.
Values expressed in this case might have been \"doing-no-harm\", or
self-actualization. But later, [in the execution]{.underline} of the
legislation, some [states emphasized the transition off of welfare to
jobs, while others chose to see the policy simply as a call to decrease
welfare rolls]{.underline}. The values invoked in these kinds of
programs might be described as market autonomy, utility, or efficiency.
Let us also reflect on the public health mandate to decrease smoking as
enunciated by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion,
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in Healthy People 2010. The
goal is to reduce the number of adults over age 18 who smoke by 12% by
the year 2010. The Healthy People 2010 website provides information for
individuals on how to stop using tobacco. The federal agency also
invested in public service announcements featuring Bill Cosby on a
variety of topics including the tobacco issue admonishing individuals
about the dangers of smoking. No mention is made in the strategies on
the website regarding market place regulations or structural remedies
such as the tobacco lawsuits, banning smoking in public places, or the
marketing of cigarettes. Guttman \[2000\] says that, consciously or
unconsciously, the [implementation of public health communication
interventions involves the application of values]{.underline}. For
instance, the execution of stop smoking programs at the individual level
assumes that individuals should be responsible for the solution to
health problems and simply need to have their refusal skills improved.
On the other hand, the decision to implement a program at a
societal-structural level identifies the locus of solution as external
to the individual. Social problems are time, place and context bound.
[The way the]{.underline} health [issue is [frame]{.mark}d as a
problem]{.underline} (or not) is likely to reflect certain priorities or
ideologies of the more dominant stakeholders. The mere identification of
the problem itself presents a value judgment: the particular view of the
ideal state is what [[determines what is considered problematic, thus
requiring action.]{.underline}]{.mark} Is the problem conceived as poor
motivation on the part of individuals who do not adopt recommended
practices? Perhaps the problem is a result of structural socioeconomic
conditions such as limited access of smokers to smoking cessation
programs. ...The locus problem can be identified at different levels, as
a lifestyle issue versus an issue mainly associated with societal
structures and distribution of resources \[p.74\]. Policy Evaluation The
final stage of the policy process determines what occurred as a result
of the selection of a policy and makes corrections in the current policy
or program as needed. Essentially, the final stage of the policy process
assesses what has occurred as a result of the implementation of the
legislative policy. Just as there is no escape from values into an
objective, fact-based mode for selecting one policy in lieu of another,
there is also no neutral, rational, objective way to measure and
calculate the benefits or harms resulting from a policy. All the same
considerations of values-based framing come into play in this seemingly
\"objective\" phase as well. To begin to evaluate a policy, several
pieces of information must be established: the goals or original
objectives of the policy; a means by which to measure the extent to
which goals have been met; and the target of the program or who the
program was intended to affect. Assembling this information involves
value laden decision-making including the views, and values of the
organizations involved, the analysts, clients or the target population,
and the general public who may be paying for the program with their tax
dollars. When assembling the indicators of success for a policy
evaluation, priorities and values become important. A particular
indicator that may gauge success by one value-laden goal \[efficiency\]
may not capture the success of the policy for another goal \[community
solidarity\] \[Guttman, 2000\]. An example provided by Deborah Stone
shows us how a value laden evaluative criterion figures in something as
seemingly straight-forward as measuring the efficiency of a library
\[Stone, 2002\]. Scholars agree that an efficiently run library is one
that builds up a good collection of books and that a particular library
in California might be more efficient if it replaced some highly paid
professionals and spent the money on building the collection of books
\[Stone, 2002\]. It is possible to imagine several challenges to the
evaluative criterion of efficiency. Some citizens may value the
resources available in the library in the form of storytelling for
children, or jobs for teenagers \[Stone, 2002\]. Some might debate what
a \"good book collection might include \[Stone, 2002\]. Finally, others
might say an efficient library is one that would save the users time by
providing the maximum amount of assistance while the patron is using the
services \[Stone, 2002\]. On the use of efficiency as an evaluative
criterion, Stone says it \"is always a contestable concept...to go
beyond the vague slogans and apply the concept to a concrete policy
choice requires making assumptions about who and what counts as
important...The answers built into supposedly technical analyses of
efficiency are nothing more that political claims\" \[p. 65\]. \"By
offering different assumptions, sides in a conflict can portray their
preferred outcomes as being most efficient\" \[Stone, 2002 p.66\].
Ultimately, evaluation of a policy becomes nothing more than a selection
among criterion based on values and ideologies. In the example below,
one can see clearly how the selection of the evaluation criterion
extricates different values. \[In\] \... an intervention to prevent
adolescent pregnancy that chose the strategy of persuading adolescent
girls to use a contraceptive implant, a likely evaluation criterion
would be the relative frequency of pregnancies before and after the
intervention in the target population. For stakeholders who define the
problem as based on sexual promiscuity or for those who believe the
girls engage in abusive sexual relationships because of low self-esteem
however, this criterion would be irrelevant because these adolescent
girls may continue to engage in premarital sex and may have simply
adopted enhanced contraceptive practices. Stakeholders who are
interested in preventing youth from being infected with sexually
transmitted diseases are not likely to find this criterion satisfactory.
The contraceptive implant may protect the adolescents from pregnancy,
but they may continue to be exposed to infection \[Guttman, 2000\].
Problem identification/gaining agenda status We saved the first step in
the policy process for last because it is here, more than at any other
stage, that framing becomes critical. The first step involves getting a
problem onto the radar screen of the legislative body that must deal
with that issue \[Clemons & McBeth, 2001\]. Problems gain legislative
attention in many ways, but typically gaining agenda status happens once
there has been a value -driven, subjective determination that an issue
is now a \"public problem\". The question then becomes: why do some
issues become public problems reaching agenda status and others do not?
The answer to this question has to do with frame construction in the
sense that an issue must be constructed so that it is perceived as
qualifying as a social problem (Best, 1995). This is a key objective in
getting the attention of the legislative body in charge. This assertion
is derived from the notion that issues get attention when they are
labeled as social or public problems (Best, 1995). How an issue becomes
a social problem is not based entirely on objective measures of the
severity of the condition but rather on a host of factors related to how
society perceives or constructs the information presented regarding the
issue (Best, 1995). Accordingly, [SFA]{.underline} is used to help
[determine]{.underline} the organizing [constructs]{.underline} or
values that may be [used to frame an issue in order to convert it into a
social problem that then captures the minds and concerns of the public
and its elected officials.]{.underline} First, a few ideas on why a
social condition is not automatically a social problem and why it must
become one before it can become a priority with the legislature. Joel
Best (1995) asserts that until something is labeled a \"social problem\"
it does not rise to a level of importance sufficient to attract the
attention of the public and policymakers. His view is called the
subjective, constructionist perspective in that it says a social
condition is a product of something defined or constructed by society
through social activities (Best, 1995). For example, when a news
conference is held on crack houses or a demonstration on litter, or
investigative reporters publish stories, or [when advocacy groups
publish a report, they are constructing or framing the issue using
claims that help build the issue into a social problem.]{.underline}
Malcolm Spector and John Kitsuse \[1977\] use the term \"claims making\"
to define the activities of individuals or groups making assertions of
grievances and claims with respect to some putative conditions that
result in social problems. According to all of these definitions, **[[it
does not matter if the objective condition exists]{.underline}]{.mark}**
or even that it may be severe. **[It [only]{.mark} matters [that people
make claims about it in such a way that it invokes the subjective mental
construct]{.mark} that will frame the issue in such a manner [that it is
believed to be a public problem]{.mark} of magnitude and worthy of
attention]{.underline}**. In other words, [[social problems are the
result of claims making activities that frame the issue so that it
triggers organizing principles]{.mark} attached to an individual\'s
deeply held worldviews]{.underline} and values (Best, 1995). [Claims
making]{.underline} activities [draw attention to social conditions and
shape our sense of the nature of the problem]{.underline} (Best, 1995).
Through rhetoric, every social condition can be constructed as many
different social problems. A claims makers\' success \[or framing\]
depends in part upon whether their claims persuade others that X is a
social problem or that Y offers the solution (Best, 1995). In the area
of public health, the construction of a problem explicates embedded
values and ideals of those who made the health problem in the first
place \[Guttman, 2000\]. The results of that [[construction]{.mark}
further [determine whether the problem gets on the agenda as well as the
range of policy solutions]{.mark}]{.underline} that appear natural or
appropriate. For instance, using [[claims that **frame the problem at
the organizational level assumes a major cause of the problem is based
in organizational arrangements**]{.underline}]{.mark} or practices
\[Guttman, 2000\]. The problem of an overweight America is defined as
people\'s lack of time or facilities at work to exercise or food at work
that is high in nutritional value \[Guttman, 2002\]. Identifying the
problem of overweight adults at this marketplace level may involve a
frame that links the problem to the industry\'s quest for profits
through the marketing of inexpensive food products high in calories
instead of nutritious products that are more expensive and thus made
less accessible \[Guttman, 2002\]. In this instance, the description of
the problem involves a frame and claims that value the public good over
market autonomy. In order to evaluate the relative merits of different
frames applied to the social problems we wish to take into the policy
process, **[we need to ask]{.underline}** the following kinds of
questions: **[Would such a frame make this problem a public issue that
gets the attention of the legislature?]{.underline}** In the instance
above involving the problem of obesity, we would ask: Framed in this
way, would the legislature then consider marketplace restrictions on
advertising or regulations on food content? This presentation was meant
to leave you with two \"take home\" lessons. Strategic [frame
analysis]{.underline} \[SFA\] [is a critical tool in the larger public
policy strategy that your organization must implement in order to
eventually win approval]{.underline} for your policies. The use of SFA
animates the public policy process because policy making, like SFA, is
driven by subjective value systems, worldviews, and ideas.

#### Plan focus makes violence inevitable \-\-- mental deputy politics absolve individual complicity

**Kappeler 95** (Susanne, Associate Professor -- Al-Akhawayn University,
The Will to Violence: The Politics of Personal Behavior, p. 10-11)

'We are the war' does not mean that the responsibility for a war is
shared collectively and diffusely by an entire society---which would be
equivalent to exonerating warlords and politicians and profiteers or, as
Ulrich Beck says, upholding the notion of collective irresponsibility1,
where people are no longer held responsible for their actions, and where
the conception of universal responsibility becomes the equivalent of a
universal acquittal. 6 On the contrary, the object is precisely to
analyze the specific and differential responsibilities of everyone in
their diverse situations. Decisions to unleash a war are indeed taken at
particular levels of power by those in a position to make them to
command such collective action. We need to hold them clearly responsible
for their decisions and actions without lessening theirs by any
collective 'assumption' of responsibility. Yet [our habit of [focusing
on the stage where]{.mark} the [major dramas]{.mark} of power [take
place]{.mark} tends to [obscure our]{.mark} sight in relation to our own
sphere of competence, our [own power and]{.mark} our own
r[esponsibility]{.mark}]{.underline}---leading to the --well-known
illusion of our apparent 'powerlessness' and its accompanying
phenomenon, our so-called political disillusionment. [Single
citizens]{.underline}- even more so those of other nations -- [have come
to feel secure in their obvious non-responsibility for such large-scale
political events as,]{.underline} say[, the wars in Croatia and
Bosnia-Hercegovina or Somalia -- since the decisions for such events are
always made elsewhere. Yet our insight that indeed we are not
responsible for the decisions of a Serbian general or a Croatian
president tends to mislead us into thinking that therefore we have no
responsibility at all, not even for forming our own
judgment]{.underline}, and thus into underrating the respons­ibility we
do have within our own sphere of action. In particular, [[it seems to
absolve us from having to try to see any relation between our own
actions and]{.mark} those [events]{.mark}, or to recognize the
connections between those political decisions and our own personal
decisions.]{.underline} It not only shows that we participate in what
Beck calls 'organized irresponsibility', upholding the apparent lack of
connection between bureaucratically, institutionally, nationally and
also individually or­ganized separate competences. [It also proves the
phenomenal and unquestioned alliance of our personal thinking with the
thinking of the major powermongers]{.underline}. For we tend to think
that we cannot 'do' anything, say, about a war, because we deem
ourselves to be in the wrong situation; because we are not where the
major decisions are made. Which is why [[many]{.mark} of those not yet
entirely disillusioned with politics tend to [engage in]{.mark} a form
of [mental deputy politics]{.mark}, in the style of ['What would I do if
I were the]{.mark}]{.underline} general, the prime minister, the
[[president]{.underline}]{.mark}, the foreign minister or the minister
of defence?' [Since we seem to regard their mega spheres of action as
the only worthwhile and truly effective ones,]{.underline} and since our
political analyses tend to dwell there first of all, [[any question of
what I would do]{.mark} if I were indeed myself tends to [peter out
in]{.mark} the comparative [insignificance]{.mark} of having what is
perceived as 'virtually no possibilities': what I could do seems petty
and futile. For my own action I]{.underline} obviously [desire the range
of action of]{.underline} a general, a prime minister, or [a General
Secretary of the UN --- finding expression in ever more prevalent
formulations like 'I want to stop this war', 'I want military
intervention',]{.underline} 'I want to stop this backlash', [or 'I want
a moral revolution.]{.underline}'7 [**['We are this
war']{.mark}**,]{.underline} however, [even if we do not command the
troops or participate in so---called peace talks, namely]{.underline} as
Drakuli\~ says, [in our non-comprehension': our willed refusal to feel
responsible for our own thinking and for working out our own
understanding, preferring innocently to drift along the ideological
current of prefabricated arguments or less than innocently taking
advantage of the advantages these offer]{.underline}. And we 'are' the
war in our 'unconscious cruelty towards you', our tolerance of the 'fact
that you have a yellow form for refugees and I don't' --- our readiness,
in other words, to build identities, one for ourselves and one for
refugees, one of our own and one for the 'others'. [[We share]{.mark} in
the [responsibility for]{.mark} this war and its [violence in the way we
let them grow inside us]{.mark}, that is, in the way we shape 'our
feelings, our relationships, our values' according to the structures and
the values of war and violence.]{.underline}

almost [[**always invisible**, **embedded in**]{.mark} **ubiquitous

occurs whenever people are disadvantaged by political, legal, economic
or cultural traditions. Because they are longstanding, structural
inequities usually seem ordinary, **the way things are and always have
been**.]{.underline} The chapters in this section teach us about some
[important but invisible forms of structural violence, and alert us to
the powerful cultural [mechanisms]{.mark} that [create and maintain them

[Structured [inequities produce]{.mark} suffering and [death **as often

more [subtle]{.mark}, [more common]{.mark}, [and more difficult to

[militarism]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Deborah Winter, Marc Pilisuk, Sara
Houck and Matthew Lee argue in their chapter, Understanding Militarism:
Money, Masculinity, and the Search for the Mystical. The authors
illuminate how socieites make soldiering a male rite of passage and
proof of manhood, thereby showing the close link between militarism and
masculinity. Militarization is also deeply rooted in spiritual motives,
as men attempt to experience mystical sacrifice through war. [Both
[masculinism and mysticism drive]{.mark} military [expenditures **beyond

to those]{.underline} (usually women and children) [whose human [needs

convenience products, western dress, and western values of individuality
and consumerism.]{.underline} The seduction of western norms is
disintegrating traditional societies which in the past provided meaning
and care for its members. Pilisuk argues that nongovernmental
organizations at the local level must work to reclaim workers dignity
and neighborhoods.

## FW -- Language

**The affirmative's framework imposes language of war that standardizes
militarization within debate and enforces a ceaseless cycle of
violence**

**Marcinkevičienė 2011** (Rūta Marcinkevičienė, 8-25-2011, accessed on
7-13-2022, *The Marketing of War in the Age of Neo-Militarism,* \"A
Dangerous Language\", )

Present-day authors continue talking about [**dehumanizing people and
euphemising war along the** same lines]{.underline} (i.e., focusing on
indirectness and warning about the **[destructive power of such
language]{.underline}**). The author of The Language of War , Steve
Thorn (2006), among other things, discusses how **[military discourse
has entered mainstream language use]{.underline}**. He also focuses on
how **[language is used to construct opposing sides during armed
conﬂict]{.underline}** (Thorn 2006). A number of other authors such as
[linguists, discourse]{.underline} analysts and columnists mostly deal
with two issues while talking about LW (i.e., its indirectness \[cl. [A
twisted language of war \] and its inﬂuence on human minds and
behavior).]{.underline} A natural question arises as to whether a direct
LW exists. The most probable type of disourse would be military jargon
reﬂecting the everyday reality of war. However, the experience provided
by observers reveals the opposite. Military jargon is even more indirect
than political discourse. The abundance of acronyms and abbreviations
that hide full and direct names of weapons of mass destruction (e.g.,
nuclear weapons are called ABMs, SLCMs and MIRYs) (Bosmajian 1984) and
euphemistic expressions with meaning hardly comprehensible for a lay
outsider (e.g . , comic books : military maps, cracker box: ﬁeld
ambulance, chicken plate: chest protector \[body armor\] worn by
helicopter gunners) (Bob Hersey's K Troop 2009) as well as abstract
nouns are prevailing features of military people's language. "[One
hardly senses that war and killing are being discussed. The destruction
of human life has been euphemized through using
abstractions"]{.underline} [(Bosmajian 1984). Thus, the speciﬁc disourse
that could be sufﬁciently direct is reported to be indirect. Its
negative effects are made explicit by Haig Bosmajian (1984):
"Dehumanizing the enemy and euphemizing the weapons of war and war
itself is a deadly combination that, unfortunately, has historically
been successful in defending the indefensible." He continues to explain
that these two language behaviors together have the effect of a) making
the reality of genuine violence invisible and b) making violence
acceptable and even desirable when military terminology is
metaphorically applied to everyday matters.]{.underline} The paradox of
LW is that: "We have wars on everything now: poverty, child hunger,
famine, debt, drugs, and even war. The only times we don't seem to have
war anymore is when we are actually involved in armed conﬂict. We have
police actions, military interventions, occupying forces, peacekeepers,
and peacemakers. They all involve the movement of troops, the ﬁring of
weapons, the destruction of property, and the loss of life the same as
war does, but technically speaking, none of them are a state of war."
(Marcus 2006) [In their famous book on metaphors, George Lakoff and Mark
Johnson (1980) reveal how **a concept of argument is verbalized in terms
of war ( indefensible claims , to attack weak points , to shoot down
somebody's arguments ) and how the structure of an argument reﬂects
this. They claim that the 'argument is war' metaphor "structures the
actions we perform in arguing"** (Lakoff and Johnson 1980, 4).
Moreover**, they suggest "to imagine a culture where an argument is
viewed as a dance, the participants are seen as performers, and the goal
is to perform in a balanced and aesthetically pleasing way. In such a
culture, people would view arguments differently, experience them
differently, carry them out differently, and talk about them
differently."** They elaborate on the essense of conceptual metaphor
that is "understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of
another" (Lakofff and Johnson 1980, 5). Some other authors, like Hardman
(2002), go further and recognize the power of language for users of the
war metaphor. **The power manifests itself not only in understanding and
experiencing reality**, as stated by cognitive linguists**, but also in
accepting appropriateness of war**: We clearly recognize the power of
language. Nevertheless, **we use a great deal of violent language in
ordinary everyday speech quite oblivious of the way in which we are
constructing our language to glorify war and violence and in that way
make such violence appear appropriate even acceptable when it appears in
reality.** (Hardman 2002) **He claims that the war metaphor plants seeds
of violence and teaches the appropriateness of war**.]{.underline}
Authors who pursuade to drop the war metaphor (and not to ﬁght against
it) talk speciﬁcally about the 'War on Terror' metaphor[.]{.underline}
The metaphor appeared in the post-9/11 American-led narrative. As George
Lakoff and Evan Frisch (2006) observe, the War on Terror metaphor was
chosen by the Bush administration even though for a few hours after the
towers fell on 9/11, administration spokesmen referred to the event as a
crime . The authors argue that the frame of crime "would have involved
international crime-ﬁghting techniques" (Lakoff and Frisch, 2006). Once
the war metaphor took hold, the real war started. According to Lakoff
and Frish, "the war metaphor created a new reality that reinforced the
metaphor." That is ﬁ nely tuned with Julie Redstone's (2001) article
about the new rhethorics and the labeling of national policy toward
terrorism as 'America's New War.' She further elaborates on the power of
the war metaphor: "And it involves the choice of a particular language
which shapes public opinion[. **The language of war is created long
before the ﬁrst plane takes off, long before the ﬁrst missile is ﬁred,
long before the ﬁrst soldier sets foot on foreign soil. It is created by
a consciousness, whether individual or collective, that chooses war as
the most effective response to threat. This choice, in turn, shapes the
consciousness of a nation**"]{.underline} (Redstone 2001). Cognitive
linguists or any authors sensitive to language and its possible effects
on human minds discourage against LW: "**[Locked in the language of war,
it's impossible to ﬁnd another way out"]{.underline}\**

#### Security Cooperation enforces a culture of dependence of militarism, but society can choose to reject this paradigm -- only the alt solves

**Jackson 11** (Susan Jackson, 8-25-2011, accessed on 7-13-2022, The
Market of War in the Age of Militarism, \"The National Security
Exception, the Global Political Economy\", )

In addition to militarism, several concepts are central to this study:
militarization, the neo-liberal economic agenda and the NSE.
[**Militarism is** characterized as "**the excessive inﬂuence of armed
forces over civilian life**" (Kaldor 2001). **This inﬂuence can be an
explicit factor in political life, with the military either directly
running the government or having a strong impact on policymaking from
'behind the scenes**.']{.underline} At the other end of the spectrum,
[militarism can be less obvious, **with societal factors generating
overall acceptance (if not overt support) of high levels of military
spending and general military readiness**. In either case**, the
military is considered integral to society because of the role it is
assumed to play in protecting society**. In general, "\[v\]irtually
**all nations make huge economic, political, and ideological investments
in militaries and militarism--- a broad system of institutions,
practices, values, and cultures that take their meaning and value from
war**"]{.underline} (Kirk 2008, 34). These investments become apparent
in the NSE. In the context of the intersection of the GPE and national
security, militarism is the idea that national security and military
security are one in the same--- **[the heightened role the military
plays in state-level security issues is based on the assumption that
national security is achieved via military capabilities.]{.underline}**
This militarism becomes apparent when we examine the assumptions that
motivate the pursuit of national security through military means and the
rules we put in place to ensure this type of national security. Of
particular interest here is how the global business rules privilege.
business when it is in connection with national security by employing
the NSE in the GPE. **[Militarization is the underlying process that
maintains the manifestation of militarism in societal
outputs]{.underline}** (e.g., arms production and military spending).
**[It is the process that entails what societies do to prepare for war
even when war is not imminent]{.underline}** (see e.g., Bowman 2002;
Enloe 1989; Regan 1994), such that it is the "contradictory and tense
social process in which civil society organizes itself for the
production of violence" (Gillis 1989, 1). [This **categorization of
militarization** moves beyond the standard deﬁnition of militarization
**as the "expansion or relative size of some integral part, scope, or
mission of the armed forces**" (Bowman 2002, 19)---which is usually
observed through budgets, number of soldiers and so on--- to a deﬁ
nition in which the role of the military is a part of societal
institutions.]{.underline} In basic terms, **[militarization is a
process in which a person or thing gradually becomes dependent for its
well-being on militaristic ideas, and military needs are considered
valuable and normal]{.underline}** (Enloe 1989). [It is this process
through which states maintain or increase their general preparations for
war even in peacetime]{.underline} (Regan 1994). The [**common
perception remains, however, that security is necessarily military, and
arms-producing and military services business happens because it is
supposed to happen rather than because people have chosen to fund their
militaries and thereby purchase weapons and services for these
militaries. In reality, people could have chosen, and still can choose,
otherwise. Militarization is not simply a given; it does not just happen
but occurs because of the actions and inactions of real people and their
interactions with real institutions or structures**. Rather, **this
process rests on deliberate decisions**]{.underline} (Enloe 2000). [In
this way, **militarization is not just about those directly involved in
the military and in arms-producing and military services companies, but
also about wider society and those who either outright bolster or more
passively fail to argue against the view the military is unquestioningly
good, natural and necessary**.]{.underline} 2 Relevant for this project,
militarization is the process through which societies decide to allow
arms-producing and military services business to operate under different
rules when the regular rules become cumbersome.

allied state actors like Emmanuel **[Macron]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Boris]{.underline}** Johnson [to devise their
agenda]{.underline}. Without political power and with limited
transnational institutions, [[global left voices]{.mark} [are]{.mark}
instead **largely [isolated]{.mark}**]{.underline} [even from one
another]{.underline}. [[There is **no mechanism**]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
developing [anything like a]{.mark} **[common
alternative]{.mark}**]{.underline} [proposal, [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
[so]{.underline}, unsurprisingly, [[left discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the United States [[can]{.mark} [read as **fractured**]{.mark} and
discordant]{.underline}. All of [[this promotes an environment in
which]{.mark} "**[doing something" means]{.mark} supporting [the
security state]{.mark}'s approach, while [questioning that]{.mark}
approach [amounts to]{.mark} "[doing nothing]{.mark}."**]{.underline}

For this reason, [[the]{.mark} American [left must]{.mark}]{.underline}
inevitably [[pursue a]{.mark} difficult [balancing
act]{.mark}]{.underline}: [offer a **genuine account**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} how [the security state]{.underline} could engage
differently with the issue at hand [while highlighting how American
**geostrategic priorities**]{.underline} [tend to]{.underline}
**[subvert democracy]{.underline}** promotion [or]{.underline}
**[civilian protection]{.underline}**. [Nowhere is this clearer than in
the **Middle East**]{.underline}, [where strategic
objectives]{.underline}---whether propping up or toppling governments,
tilting the regional balance of power toward allies such as Saudi Arabia
and the UAE, pursuing counterterrorism goals against actors like ISIS,
or securing Israeli interests---[have borne]{.underline}, at best, [a
**contingent relationship**]{.underline} [to stated **humanitarian
values**]{.underline}.

Recent [events in **Ukraine**]{.underline} [provide an example
of]{.underline} the challenges involved in [this balancing
act]{.underline}. [**Russia's invasion** is a brutal act of
**imperialism**]{.underline} [that violates basic principles of
self-determination]{.underline}. [Ukrainians]{.underline} on the ground
[are engaged in a **legitimate war** of]{.underline} [armed]{.underline}
[resistance]{.underline} that has so far stalled Russian advances, [in
part due to defensive **military aid** from]{.underline}
[abroad]{.underline}. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has
**[rightly championed]{.mark}**]{.underline} such
[**[resistance]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline}]{.mark} it has done so
[[through a **flawed**]{.mark} **policy
[framework]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that harks]{.mark} back [to
a]{.mark} mid-twentieth-century **[Manichaean]{.mark} [idea]{.mark}** of
friends and enemies]{.underline}.

[The approach is [built on **boosting**]{.mark}]{.underline} military
**[[primacy in Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}** (more troops are now on the
continent than in over two decades), [as well as **ratcheting** up
**arms** across the region]{.underline}. Along with a "lend-lease" bill
aimed at easing weapons supplies---with a name that invokes memories of
the Second World War---Congress just passed a new military assistance
package that involves massive sums (\$40 billion on top of
an earlier \$14 billion, even more than what Biden requested). Together
this is, according to the Associated Press, equal to nearly the
entire State Department budget and about one-third of Ukraine's GDP. As
historian Adam Tooze noted, [all this means we are "**financing**
nothing less than **a total war**]{.underline}," [a worry reinforced
by]{.underline} leaked (and then denied) [reports that the United States
is **providing intel**ligence]{.underline} specifically [directed
at]{.underline} **[killing Russian generals]{.underline}**.

Such [policies have]{.underline} also [gone hand in hand with an
**aggressive sanctions**]{.underline} [approach]{.underline},
effectively [meant to cut off Russia]{.underline} [from]{.underline}
much of [the global economy]{.underline}---[despite]{.underline}
scholarly [evidence noting that most sanctions]{.underline}, [while
**forcing civilian** population**s** to **pay a heavy
price**]{.underline}, [rarely bring wars]{.underline} [to a
close]{.underline}. At the same time, [the United States is
**supporting** Sweden and Finland's **applications to join
NATO**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} by all accounts [has
been]{.underline} **[cool on]{.underline}** various third-party efforts
to negotiate [a]{.underline} **[diplomatic solution]{.underline}**.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} United States is embracing an anti-imperial
fight, but that **[genuine [desire]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to]{.mark}
[confront]{.mark} authoritarian [aggression]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is
filtered through]{.mark} an]{.underline} [**[existing]{.mark} set** of
national security paradigms]{.underline} [and institutional
[practices]{.mark}. U.S. actions are]{.underline} effectively [shaped
by]{.underline} **[background]{.underline}** geostrategic
**[assumptions]{.underline}**---in this case, to weaken a global
antagonist on a relatively peripheral battlefield (for Americans, at
least). The problem is that [[these]{.underline}]{.mark} framing
[drives]{.underline}---especially connected to sustaining a dominant
global position---tend to [[reproduce a **conveyor belt**]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} common [policies]{.mark} [that]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[lock
in]{.mark}to place]{.underline}** [[when]{.mark}ever [crises
emerge]{.mark}]{.underline}. Taken as a whole,
[[these]{.underline}]{.mark} [policies]{.underline} often [[push in
**escalatory directions**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that]{.underline} can
**[diverge]{.underline}** [from]{.underline} goals of [humanitarian
protection and **peaceful resolution**]{.underline}. [They may
**deemphasize**]{.underline} concern with the **[costs]{.underline}**
connected to keeping a conflict going [if it can
**undermine**]{.underline} [Russia's]{.underline} **[relative
power]{.underline}** [vis-à-vis the United States and its]{.underline}
[allies]{.underline}.

The potential for dangerous ratcheting effects under established U.S.
policy doesn't mean that left voices should argue for nonintervention in
the context of Russian imperialism. But it does require a [[tailored
analysis]{.underline}]{.mark} that carefully disaggregates the bundle of
conventional security policies that jointly have pushed toward
destructive outcomes. Such analysis [**[resists the]{.mark}** security
state's **"[take it or leave it" stance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which
habitually]{.underline} [defines as **left obstructionism**]{.underline}
[any refusal to **sign up** to whatever package officials **contend**
promotes **freedom abroad**]{.underline}.

[[Russia's invasion]{.mark} [calls for]{.mark} a left embrace of
Ukrainian self-determination and **[support for]{.mark}**
genuinely]{.underline} **[[defensive]{.underline}]{.mark}** military
**[[assistance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [aimed at preventing an
**illegitimate overthrow**]{.underline}. [The hegemonic position of the
United States and its **history** of **failed
interventions**]{.underline} [tend strongly to **countenance** against
American military involvement]{.underline}, [especially if one begins
from a **basic principle** of assessing policy choices through
the]{.underline} [prism of "**do no harm**]{.underline}." But that does
not mean that in all cases leftists should oppose any kind of U.S.
military support. I would argue, for instance, that the failure of the
United States in the early to mid-1990s to provide similar assistance to
Bosnians, also under circumstances of invasion, was a moral and
political error. It set the stage for genocide and ethnic cleansing. And
later, that very failure to provide defensive support became a
justification for an illegal American and NATO bombing campaign in
Kosovo---one that augured decades of sustained U.S. international rule
defection.

Critically, though, any [defensive assistance must be]{.underline}
employed to **[deescalate]{.underline}** rather than intensify
hostilities and violence. In this case, [that means carefully
**distinguishing** between]{.underline} **[actual
self-defense]{.underline}** [needs]{.underline} [and a]{.underline}
**[proxy]{.underline}** geostrategic **[conflict]{.underline}**---[and
refusing to fund a shift toward the latter]{.underline}.
[It]{.underline} also [entails rejecting broad sanctions in favor of
**targeted measures**]{.underline} [that focus on those **complicit** in
Russian aggression]{.underline}. And to the extent that other wider
economic policies are also pursued, these should proceed through
multilateral efforts to close tax havens that all oligarchs, not just
Russians, take advantage of. Above all, defensive military assistance
must be joined to a driving commitment to diplomatic negotiations that
generate peace. Assistance cannot be used as a way---through seemingly
unlimited funds---to trap Russia in a Ukrainian quagmire. That goal may
aid American objectives in a "new Cold War" but would also intensify the
humanitarian catastrophe on the ground.

Moreover, [a [leftist analysis should be **deeply
concerned**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[about]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[further]{.mark} [militarization]{.mark}]{.underline}** [of the
European continent]{.underline}. Such [militarization moves in the
**opposite direction** of]{.underline} [any **truly peaceful
order**]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} [would be marked **instead**
by]{.underline} **[mutual disarmament]{.underline}** [and shared
decision-making]{.underline}. [[The idea of]{.mark} a [Europe]{.mark}an
future **[governed]{.mark} [by]{.mark}** yet]{.underline} **[[more
American primacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [structured through the
**overwhelming presence**]{.underline} [of arms [carries]{.mark} with
it]{.underline} real **[[dystopian possibilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
even if the prospect of a demilitarized Europe appears farther away than
ever.

Russia is an incredibly dangerous actor, but it is clearly outmatched
militarily and economically by U.S. allies in Europe, a fact further
underscored by its reversals in Ukraine. At the same time, authoritarian
populism is on the rise throughout the continent. [Future scenarios
exist in which the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline},
and perhaps France as well, [are run by **far-right
autocrats**]{.underline}, in addition to various other European states.
[Sharply expanding]{.underline} [military spending]{.underline}
everywhere in this context [is a **recipe** for **hostile

Towards a Humbler Conception

Much of the problem with grand strategy is that, as a concept, it
suffers from people over-claiming what it can achieve --- it is often
thought of as a "silver bullet," "master plan," or a "road map to match
means with ends." Seeing it as such a panacea for policymaking only sets
it up for failure, since no fixed, tidy, and decided plan on the scale
required could ever withstand the unpredictable onslaught of
international politics.

Instead, [[grand strategy is]{.mark} best understood]{.underline}
**[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as [a process]{.mark}]{.underline}
[(**[leading to]{.underline}**]{.mark} the production of
[**[plans]{.underline}**) [but]{.underline}]{.mark} [as [a **habit of
mind**]{.mark}]{.underline}: [a conscious attempt [to look
**beyond**]{.mark} the **[confines]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [short-term requirements of national defense
or]{.underline} day-to-day, **[[immediate]{.underline}]{.mark}** foreign
[**[policy]{.underline}**, [and to]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[pursui]{.mark}t of]{.underline} national [interests in
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} more **[[systematic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
synchronized **[[way]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [It remains [conscious
of]{.mark}]{.underline} first-order
**[[assumptions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline} first-order
**[principles]{.underline}** [within a nation's policymaking culture,
[and]{.mark} importantly]{.underline}, **[[the
ways]{.underline}]{.mark}** in which **[[these should be
altered]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the context of a changing
international order. As David Morgen Owen writes in the Strategy Bridge,
"grand strategy is a concept rooted in the demands of making strategy in
the real world." Indeed, [[an appreciation for the **nature**]{.mark}
**and pace** [of]{.mark} change in [the]{.mark} international
[environment]{.mark}]{.underline}, and a country's place within that
system, [[is]{.underline} **[central]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[to]{.underline} grand **[strategic thinking]{.underline}**. In
formulating such a position, it creates what Hal Brands refers to as
"the intellectual architecture" from which more detailed policies flow.

[At no other time is grand strategic thinking **more
useful**]{.underline} [than]{.underline} in [moments when
the]{.underline} [international order seems to be
**shifting**]{.underline} [in unpredictable directions]{.underline}. To
suggest that grand strategy is only possible in predictable and
harmonious environments is short-sighted. It is difficult to think of
many periods in the past two hundred years when statesmen and women
anywhere in the world have enjoyed such conditions. Their worlds, like
ours, were of ever-increasing interaction and complexity. [[The
planet]{.mark} today]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} not the
first "[**disordered**, **cluttered**, and
**[fluid]{.mark}**]{.underline} realm" that has challenged policymakers,
and it would come as quite a surprise to certain statesmen and civil
servants of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, for example, to be
told otherwise.

Understanding Rooted in History

It is well known that the term "grand strategy" was first used in the
mid-19th-century Britain to describe the scale of the military activity
during the Napoleonic Wars, and has evolved since then through thinkers
such Alfred Thayer Mahan and Julian Corbett, who used the term in the
context of maritime strategy, eventually coming to mean something bigger
and more all-encompassing than the military sphere. As Basil Liddel
Hart described it, grand strategy was a way of thinking that "looks
beyond the war to the subsequent peace." Others, including the
historian Michael Howard later spoke of grand strategy as not simply
being about "war fighting" but "war avoidance."

Yet this approach to statecraft --- what is essentially a way of
thinking about the international system and a country's place within it
--- had been in practice for much longer. One could look to Castlereagh,
Canning, or Palmerston and find that for them, good statecraft meant
conceiving of national interests in a more systematic and synchronized
way than the day-to-day business of foreign affairs. Despite their
individual differences, all shared an understanding of British national
interests as being both shaped by the international environment, and ---
with good leadership --- constitutive of it. They did not set down
strict rules of conduct or "roadmaps" to achieve this, but reflected, in
broader terms, about the international context in which the state
operated and the type of environment that was best suited to its pursuit
of prosperity and security. Good statecraft for them, in other words,
meant taking the time to think grand strategically. At the core of this
was what might be called a "historical sensibility" --- an understanding
of the nature and pace of change in the international environment ---
and an effort to craft a foreign policy around the big picture and the
long term.

Similarly, when the Fifth Marquess of Lansdowne became Foreign Secretary
in 1900, he found the British Empire in danger of being subsumed by a
rapidly changing international environment, and rather than retreat into
incrementalism, he advocated a strategy suited to present realities. The
fallout from the Boxer Rebellion in China, the Fashoda Incident with
France in the Nile River Valley, and the Spanish-American War were
indicative of an international order that was edging towards an
uncomfortable reset. The increases in naval power among the French,
Russians, Germans, Americans, and Japanese led the Director of Naval
Intelligence to remark that British superiority in the West Indies,
Pacific, and Atlantic had "passed away." As one journalist wrote, "The
Empire stripped of its armour, has its hands tied behind its back and
its bare throat exposed to the keen knife of its bitterest enemies."
Within this context, [the Boer War]{.underline}, which began in 1899,
[was becoming]{.underline} both [a highly public]{.underline}
**[humanitarian catastrophe]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} an
embarrassing **[quagmire]{.underline}** for the country, which exposed
an under-trained and ill-equipped military. Thus,
[[Lansdowne]{.underline} **[did not inherit]{.underline}**
[a]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[shared worldview]{.underline}]{.mark}**
among key political constituencies," which Drezner, Krebs, and Schweller
consider a requirement for grand strategy, [[nor]{.mark} even a **shared
[understanding]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} the **nature and
purpose of** the **[empire]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Both within and
without parliament, [[the government was]{.underline}
**[challenged]{.underline}** [by]{.underline}]{.mark} **[strong
[opposition]{.mark}]{.underline}** to the Boer War
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} by **[fierce [debates]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[about the]{.mark} future of the **[imperial
project]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Was Britain]{.mark} a
"**[benign]{.mark} hegemon**]{.underline}" [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} an
illiberal **[[imperial]{.mark} behemoth]{.underline}** which needed to
be restrained or even dismantled? And what did this mean for the policy
of non-alignment which had served the country well for decades? The
Cabinet was deeply divided, riven by debates that questioned the
first-order principles governing national strategy. In this context,
Lansdowne reflected on the precariousness of world order, and the
startlingly high stakes modern policymaking had created: "In these days,
war breaks out with a suddenness which was unknown in former days, when
nations were not, as they are now, armed to the teeth and ready to enter
on hostilities at any moment."

Yet [[these conditions **did not paralyze**]{.underline}]{.mark} grand
**[strategic [thinking]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- [instead [they
**catalyzed it**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The "prejudice against
alliances," which for so long had existed in the highest ranks of
British foreign policy, would have to be replaced by a more innovative
approach, one based on repairing and developing strategic partnerships.
For Lansdowne, the pace of armament and the frequency of international
conflicts meant that Britain's traditional approach --- which
some referred to as "splendid isolation" --- was no longer viable. The
remedy, in his view, was a dramatic break with the policy of
non-alignment in order to develop a strategic alliance with Japan, and
by the end of 1905, Britain's position on the high seas, as Paul Kennedy
has noted, was "more favorable than it had been for the previous two
decades." Closely related was Lansdowne's desire to repair relationships
considered to be of strategic value to the United Kingdom. The
Anglo-French agreement of 1904, known as the Entente Cordiale, helped
lay the foundation for a cross-channel alliance which would develop in
later years, one which had profound effects on the course of World War
I. Added to this was an understanding that an agreement with France, as
Lansdowne put it, "would not improbably be the precursor of a better
understanding with Russia," a country which was France's alliance
partner and viewed by some in the British government as the preeminent
long-term threat. Further afield, Lansdowne initiated a rapprochement
with the United States --- our "brothers across the ocean," as
he worded it --- which resolved longstanding differences between
Washington and London concerning the construction of an Isthmian canal
and the boundary of the Alaskan territory. The agreements provided a
"clean slate," as Lansdowne put it, which would give way to a "new
chapter" in Anglo-American relations.

## Alt -- Demilitarization

#### Through the act of repurposing the military as a means of demilitarization, a just transition can be better advanced.

[Implementing these steps of fiscal shift, economic conversion, and
retraining and transition would have a profound benefit for workers and
communities, while greatly reducing the additional risks and already
occurring impacts of social and ecological catastrophe.]{.underline} A
just transition approach brings this necessary focus to the process of
demilitarization. The demographic profile of the U.S. military has
dramatically diversified over the last half century, demonstrating the
opportunities here for the many BIPOC people now doing this work. It is
also recognized that veterans, BIPOC people, and people of Latin
American descent often hold high levels of concern for climate change
(Leiserowitz and Akerlof, 2010; Motta et al., 2021). [Yet for many
communities, military service provides a rare path out of inequitable
conditions at home, while military recruitment is known to target
low-to-middle income and poor communities]{.underline} (Steichen and
Koshgarian, 2020). [This repurposing would dramatically broaden the
opportunities for high-quality, safe, and meaningful work among these
communities and beyond. Meanwhile, military personnel, bases, and their
communities often suffer disproportionate levels of pollution, domestic
violence, mental and physical health problems, alcohol and drug use,
suicide, and other social and economic disparities.]{.underline}
Contamination and pollution from military testing sites and weapons
manufacturing hit local communities hardest, too often involving
inadequate compensation. A repurposing would reduce these
vulnerabilities by directly remedying and improving conditions for these
communities. This work would start by cleaning up the many contaminated
sites worldwide, and extend to a permanent peace economy that avoids the
multi-generational and multi-dimensional harms and trauma of militarism.
As the U.S. military extends globally, so too would the effects of
demilitarization through a just transition. Shifting from a role of
securing fossil-fuel and energy dominance, a repurposed military under
civilian control could activate a wave of global cooperation and
solidarity, moving funding and personnel to support international aid
and climate change adaptation and mitigation. Global agreements for
nuclear weapon and fossil-fuel non-proliferation, poverty reduction, and
ecological restoration may then receive the attention and support needed
to make a real difference for people and planet. This approach is based
on a radically different view of "national security" in recognizing the
impossibility, immorality, and recklessness of the "fortress" response
to climate change. Global climate change by definition is a global
issue, not a national security one. Implementing a just transition urges
a world view of collective solidarity and mutual interdependence.
Demilitarization can enable support for displaced refugees and climate
migrants, reduce tensions and military build-up in other nations, and
ripple out to improving the lives of poor people worldwide (Siddique,
2021). The obstacles and challenges of demilitarization are many. For
one, we must stay critically engaged, lest this process be coopted as
yet another opportunity to exert further military control over civilian
life. [The nonnegotiable goal is rather to reclaim the assets of the
military and reposition them under strict civilian control for
non-military purposes. There are also the cultural biases and
identities, and myths of the glory of war and militarism that require a
committed, multi-faceted response to shift these narratives and develop
real alternatives for achieving lasting security]{.underline} (Shifferd
and Hiller, 2020). The vested interests, from fossil-fuel corporations,
military contractors, Pentagon elites, and DoD officials, to federal,
state, and local politicians will do all in their substantial power to
resist cuts and downsizing. [Yet no real transition to a peaceful and
ecological future is possible without demilitarization.]{.underline} A
significant leverage point is whether and how workers and their
communities can be effectively and consistently engaged and help lead
this just transition (Eisenscher, 2014).

#### Demilitarization has worked empirically -- key to promoting disarmament and preventing further unchecked violence

the Example of the Åland Islands,\" No Publication,

In 2017 Finland is celebrating its centennial. This year, it marked an
even older anniversary: on 30 March 2016, it was [160 years since the
demilitarization of the Åland Islands]{.underline}, an archipelago of
more than six and a half thousand islands scattered in the middle of the
Baltic Sea between what is today mainland Finland and Sweden. They are
inhabited by almost 29,000 people, the vast majority of whom are Swedish
speakers. The [demilitarization of the Åland]{.underline} Islands was
[established by a tripartite convention between Great Britain, France
and Russia and confirmed in the 1856 Treaty of Paris]{.underline}, which
[ended the Crimean War]{.underline}. To be sure, it was hardly a naïve
love of peace that motivated the agreement, nor was there at the time
any particular concern for the wellbeing of the people who populated the
islands. The [**logic of** the **demilitarization**]{.underline} was,
and still [is, **that of ensuring** that this **small piece of
territory** would not be fortified and therefore **would be less
attractive militarily and less dangerous** than it would otherwise
be.]{.underline} This was of particular concern for neighbouring Sweden,
one of the driving forces behind the agreement, even though Sweden chose
to remain outside the settlement of 1856 for various reasons. An early
confidence-building measure With the Convention on the Demilitarization
of the Åland Islands, the superpowers of the time wanted to provide a
pragmatic solution to the challenge of strengthening, as it was put in
the French original text, "les bienfaits de la paix générale" -- "the
benefits of general peace". [Rather than competing for military
presence]{.underline} in and territorial control of this controversial
territory, the states [parties accepted to keep away from
it]{.underline} and create a platform for communication about matters
that concerned it. One could call it an early confidence-building
measure. The [demilitarization agreement]{.underline} can be [seen
as]{.underline} a [forerunner to]{.underline} the [collective security
system]{.underline} that was [established through]{.underline} the
[Covenant of the League of Nations]{.underline} in 1920, with the aim of
limiting the use of force in interstate relations and creating new
avenues for addressing conflicts and threats to peace. The idea of
collective dispute settlement was at the core of the League of Nations
system, but, as we all know, it collapsed, or rather took time out (in
part as a result of the unwillingness of the superpowers of that time to
follow the rules they had themselves enacted) before being succeeded by
the United Nations and the United Nations Charter in 1945. Meanwhile,
the Convention on the Demilitarization of the Åland Islands was
strengthened through the adoption in 1921 of the Convention on the
Non-Fortification and Neutralization of the Åland Islands. Among the ten
original signatories was Finland, which had been recognized by then as
an independent state and become a member of the League of Nations.
Finland had already been granted territorial sovereignty over the
islands through a dispute settlement by the League of Nations earlier
that same year. The internationally entrenched binding rules on
neutralization for the islands are distinct from the policy of
neutrality and non-alliance of Finland. The [neutralization]{.underline}
rules [added]{.underline} to the previous international legal
commitments the [prohibition of using "directly or
indirectly]{.underline}" the Åland Islands "for any purpose connected
with [military operations" in times of war.]{.underline} A long
tradition In fact, [demilitarization was nothing new]{.underline} in the
late 19th century. The first documented examples date back to the early
Middle Ages and rules requiring the demolition of fortifications and
prohibiting their reconstruction were found regularly in peace treaties
concluded in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. An early example was
the 1559 Treaty of Château Cambrésis (between France and Spain), which
included a prohibition of fortifications in the area of Thérouanne. In
1768, Denmark ceded several islands in the mouth of the river Elbe to
Hamburg and at the same time it was provided that no military
installations were to be built on these islands. A large number of
demilitarization arrangements were included in the treaties ending the
First World War, e.g. on the Saar Region, the Free City of Danzig,
Spitsbergen/Svalbard and islands in the Mediterranean. This pattern
continued well into the period following the Second World War, for
instance with regard to the Dodecanese Islands, Pelagosa and the Free
Territory of Trieste. A special case, in terms of the level of
institutionalization of its internationalized management is that of
Antarctica. The 1959 Antarctic Treaty stipulates that "in the interest
of all mankind...Antarctica shall continue forever to be used
exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or
object of international discord". A more recent, though inconclusive,
effort towards demilitarization was the 1999 plan by the former United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan for Cyprus. One element of the plan
was the demilitarization of the island. Sovereignty maintained
[Demilitarization and neutralization can be understood as limitations to
territorial sovereignty, but they function, simultaneously, as
confirmations of the idea of territorial sovereignty and control of
territory.]{.underline} In fact, the Åland Islands regime is premised
upon clear territorial sovereignty and thus the ability and legal right
as well as obligation -- of Finland in this case -- to repel attacks and
imminent threats against the zone, in order to safeguard its
demilitarized and neutral status. However, this same solution is also an
exception and a provocation to our thinking about the ways in which such
territorial sovereignty can be exercised. The [rules of demilitarization
and neutralization entail a legally binding promise of giving priority
to diplomatic means of communication and negotiation, before means of
military power]{.underline}, even though power relations are
acknowledged. The demilitarization is managed primarily by the Finnish
Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The system requires transparency and
communication on alleged controversies, something which became even
clearer in the 1940 bilateral treaty between Finland and the Soviet
Union. Both Sweden and the Russian Federation have consulates on Åland.
The Governor of the Åland Islands heads the state administration on the
islands, attends to state security matters and functions as a link
between the Republic of Finland and the regional government and
parliament of the self-government of Åland. The Governor, who is
appointed by the President of the Republic of Finland with the agreement
of the Speaker of the Åland parliament, also maintains regular contact
with the consulates. **[Demilitarization is a small step towards
disarmament]{.underline}**. It is a recognition of the fact that the
[**arms races** that took place in many countries prior to both 1914 and
1939 were strong **contributing factors to** the outbreak of the
devastating **World Wars.**]{.underline} The financial frustrations of
these pre-war periods are absent today. According to the United Nations
Development Programme's 2015 Human Development Report, most countries in
the OSCE region belong to the top strata of countries with a very high
or high human development level. [Still]{.underline}, we are
[witnessing]{.underline}, in Europe and beyond, a [slow but steady
escalation of aggressive rhetoric and military expenditures and
activities, alongside an expanding use of force
internationally.]{.underline} It is seldom easy or fruitful to try to
establish who was first to start a conflict and who should take the
largest blame in the midst of a difficult situation. Under such
conditions [**we need** to strengthen tools and strategies of
communication and co-operation wherever we can and find **new ways of
promoting disarmament. Demilitarization is one of them**. It is a
pragmatic and contextual solution which requires cautious management by
all parties concerned and a commitment to the restriction of the use of
force]{.underline}. Could it be [useful in new situations]{.underline}?
What about the Arctic, for instance? Could a different but similar
solution be envisaged here, relying on the old idea that the Arctic
areas should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes?

**[[As militarization spreads through the culture, it produces policies
that rely more on force than on dialogue and
compassion]{.underline}]{.mark}**; it offers up modes of identification
that undermine democratic values and tarnish civil liberties; and [it
**[makes the production of]{.mark}** both symbolic and material
[violence a central feature of everyday life]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
Kevin Baker points out[**, [we are quickly becoming a nation that
\"substitute\[s\] military solutions for almost everything, including
international alliances, diplomacy, effective intelligence agencies,
democratic institutions - even national security\"]{.mark}**
[(38).]{.mark} Within this ideology, masculinity is associated with
violence, and action is often substituted for the democratic processes
of deliberation and debate.]{.underline} Militarization is about the
rule of force and the expansion of repressive state power. In fact,
democracy appears as an excess in this logic and is often condemned by
militarists as being a weak system of government. Echoes of this
anti-democratic sentiment can be found in the Patriot Act with its
violation of civil liberties, in a rancorous patriotism that equates
dissent with treason, and in the discourse of public commentators, who,
in the fervor of a militarized culture, fan the flames of hatred and
intolerance. One example that has become all too typical emerged after
the September 11 attacks. Columnist Ann Coulter, in calling for a holy
war on Muslims, wrote \"We should invade their countries, kill their
leaders and convert them to Christianity. We weren\'t punctilious about
locating and punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We
carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That\'s war. And this
is war/715. While this statement does not reflect mainstream of American
opinion, the uncritical and chauvinistic patriotism and intolerance that
inform it not only have become standard fare among many conservative
radio hosts in the United States but are increasingly being legitimated
in a wide variety of cultural [venues. **[By blurring the lines between
military and civilian functions, militarization deforms our language,
debases democratic values, celebrates fascist modes of
control]{.mark}**, defines citizens as soldiers, and diminishes our
ability as a nation to uphold international law and support a democratic
global public sphere.]{.underline} [**[Unless militarization is
systematically exposed and resisted at every place where it appears in
the culture, it will undermine the meaning of critical
citizenship]{.mark}** and do great harm to those institutions that are

From 2014 to 2017, I taught an intensive January term course, Cultures
of War and Peace, at St. Mary's College of California, a Catholic
liberal arts school. [I wanted students to see that the **U**nited
**S**tates is a **highly militarized society**, **bolstered by massive
corporate investments** in military contracts and political support for
high military spending,]{.underline} and to think about what could be
gained, in terms of social justice and everyday security, by changing
this. [Students]{.underline} came into these classes with a wide range
of knowledge and opinions. They had [grown up on]{.underline} [video
games, war movies, mass shootings, and drone strikes]{.underline}. They
had [heard repeated]{.underline} [assertions that war is "a necessary
evil" or that "diplomacy doesn't work]{.underline}." [Many
believed]{.underline} that [America]{.underline} (their term)
[is]{.underline} the "good guy" and strongly identified with the nation
("We went into Iraq . . ."). [Two-thirds were young men]{.underline},
[mostly first year students and mostly white]{.underline}. [**A few**
**were veterans or enrolled in ROTC**. Most had **family** members who
had served **in** the **military**.]{.underline} Their affection and
**[respect for these relatives made it difficult]{.underline}** for many
of them **[to question militarism as an institution]{.underline}**. I
provided a lot of information, which I hoped would help students
contextualize and evaluate what they already knew. I emphasized the
scale of US military spending, for example. This was \$611 billion in
2016, more than the next eight countries combined.1 Over \$700 billion
is projected for 2019, over half the Federal discretionary budget.2 Yet
we are told money is not available for public schools, Head Start, elder
care, Veterans benefits, and many other socially useful programs that
have been cut without remorse or apology. In researching Federal budget
trade-offs many [students were shocked]{.underline} to discover [what
their cities and counties could have bought with the money they
contribute to the military]{.underline}.3 [Some students]{.underline}
felt the course was too negative about this country and war in general.
They [thought of themselves as realists]{.underline}---mature,
pragmatic, and willing to accept "necessary evils." [They
scorned]{.underline} moves toward [demilitarization as
idealistic]{.underline}. I asked what ideas and projects "realism"
excludes, makes unsayable, or unimaginable? The course materials
[referenced the vast damage war and militarism cause]{.underline}.4
[What is realistic about this]{.underline}? What might be useful about
idealism? I wanted students to be able to question government policy and
the role of the United States internationally. What does it mean to be
American? Is there only one place to stand? How to widen the limited
public discourse on Gwyn Kirk · 37 these issues? Could this country play
a more constructive role internationally? If so, how should it do this?
I [wanted students to see that it is absolutely **legitimate to desire
something better** than the **current militarized, unsustainable state
of the world**.]{.underline} The college's stated principles of social
justice, religious faith, and respect for all persons created the space
for a course like this. Even so, it was a hard sell. I [discarded many
readings I thought these students might dismiss as
rhetorical.]{.underline} I [tiptoed around feminist concepts like
"militarized masculinity]{.underline}" (Enloe 2000, 235). I had to learn
how to carry on this intensive discussion as a white woman older than
their grandmas, with students I would probably not otherwise teach. I
focus on militarism here, but those who teach about the impacts of
globalization or the role of the nation-state face similar challenges.
[**Liberal perspectives** **do not question** the fundamental
assumptions and **institutions** of our society, **which is essential**
**for** addressing **the root causes of injustice.**]{.underline} By
contrast, [**seeking equal access to combat roles or Senate seats,**
difficult as that may be, **is a very limited goal.**]{.underline}
Further, many students know little about the effects of US policies on
people in other nations, or how the United States exercises power
worldwide---culturally, economically, politically, and militarily. Some
students' sense of patriotism made them highly resistant to thinking
about such issues (Hase 2002). A few dismissed virtually all the course
materials as "ridiculous rubbish," "hippy nonsense," or laughably naïve.
In their papers, I commented that, in college, students' work must
engage with the ideas presented. You can rebut them but you can't simply
dismiss them with "put-downs" like this. I asked the group, If you find
yourself feeling defensive about a reading or something said in class,
what is being attacked? What is at stake for you? Could you respond with
curiosity instead of feeling offended? What else would it help you to
know? As a group, the students knew much more about war than they did
about peace, a concept that seemed hazy and weak. We watched Facing Fear
(Cohen 2013), featuring Tim Zaal, a former neo-Nazi skinhead, and
Matthew Boger, the gay victim of Zaal's hate-crime attack. Remarkably,
these men met again twenty-five years after that incident. They were
challenged to grapple with their feelings and fears about each other,
and against the odds, they became friends. I asked students about their
own experiences of forgiveness and reconciliation and what it takes to
change their hearts and their behavior. We watched Regret to Inform by
Barbara Sonneborn (2000), who visited Vietnam to learn about other
widows' experiences twenty years after her husband was killed there.
Vietnamese women were touched by this and thanked her for wanting to
know how they'd coped with the devastation of that war in their own
land---a small moment of personal reconciliation between women who had
been defined as enemies. A guest speaker, formerly in the Navy and now a
youth worker, explained why and how he became a conscientious objector.
Students read about US Army veterans who knelt before indigenous elders
at Standing Rock and apologized for US wars against their people. They
read about community truth-telling efforts as part of healing from
violence and conflict, and about dedicated behind-thescenes work to
hammer out agreements between groups or nations. Following Enloe (2000),
[I emphasized demilitarization as a step-by-step process rather than
peace as a static condition.]{.underline} [Nations may become more or
less militarized, depending on many factors.]{.underline} Creating
Resources for Teaching and Learning Thanks to Franklin Graham, our first
editor, Margo Okazawa-Rey and I were able to include a chapter on women
and the military in Women's Lives: Multicultural Perspectives. This
fo[cuses on militarism as a central institution in this
country.]{.underline} It considers how [militarism deploys gender and
race, the impact of war and US bases on women overseas, and it discusses
feminist opposition to militarism and war.]{.underline} Although not all
teachers who use the book assign this chapter, the increase in
militarization, especially since 9/11, makes it a salient topic for an
introductory course. Another resource is Living along the Fenceline, a
low-budget documentary featuring grassroots women leaders from Okinawa
(Japan) to Texas and Puerto Rico (Hoshino, Kirk, and Lee 2012). Although
not considered war zones, these strategic sites are part of a network of
roughly 1,000 overseas bases that allow the United States to go to war
anytime, anywhere. These women are not fourstar generals or White House
strategists. Their expertise comes from living with the effects of
militarism on a daily basis. Director Lina Hoshino focused on women's
stories. She filmed barbed wire fences around the bases, DANGERKEEP OUT
signs, fighter jets zooming overhead, and the grassy spot in a park
where a woman was raped by soldiers and tells us, this is where it
happened. Despite different locations, the film shows recurring
patterns: gender-based violence, environmental destruction, the impacts
of colonization, and the importance of women's organizing and
leadership. Our goal was to affirm each woman's work in responding to
the US military presence in her backyard, and to show the possibility of
a very different kind of security centered on respect for people and the
land. [I have helped to organize antimilitary fashion shows as a way to
discuss militarism in accessible terms]{.underline} (Ahn and Kirk 2009).
The Women of Color Resource Center staged the first one at a
standing-room-only event in Oakland in 2005 featuring original designs
as well as street "camo" and demo wear (Enloe 2007). As models walked
the "runway," a narrator read a script describing each outfit.5 Feminist
scholar Cynthia Enloe talked about the military origins of khaki. Spoken
word artists and musicians added to the event's energy and political
analysis. Since then, various groups have put on their own versions of
this show. Local artists and designers, thrift-store bargain hunters,
and people handy with a needle, glue gun, stapler, or duct tape have
made remarkable outfits: Bomb Gown, Military Carbon Footprint, Bikini,
Respirator Bra, Fence Dress, War Is Not Sexy, People's Budget, Uncle
Spam, and more. These shows can be theatrical events as in Oakland and
at the University of Oregon, or pared down as part of a talk or
workshop. Much of the excitement is in designing original outfits and
scripts that encapsulate the stories people want to tell. Another
community project was an event at the Comfort Women memorial in San
Francisco. This memorial, located in a public park, commemorates some
400,000 young women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese Imperial
Army from 1931 to 1945 (McGrane 2017).6 For International Women's Day
2018, members of local groups created altars representing other examples
of systemic violence against women---in addition to the plight of WWII
comfort women---and celebrating resistance to it: • [missing and
murdered indigenous women, • women victims of war and drone strikes, •
migrant women crossing the US-Mexico border, • women impacted by US
military bases in Asia, • violence against Palestinian women living
under Israeli occupation, and • violence against trans women in this
country]{.underline}. [In each case, soldiers, prison guards, police
officers, or Border Patrol have assaulted, raped, and killed women or
gender nonconforming people]{.underline}. This may be **[based on state
policy]{.underline}** as with WWII [comfort women, or **on militarized
assumptions** **and cultures of law enforcement** **that condone,
justify, or encourage gender-based violence.**]{.underline} Those in
authority may ignore these crimes. They may refuse to believe survivors'
testimony, close down public discussion, and cover up evidence. Culprits
may be promoted, protected, or let off with a slap on the wrist. These
factors make it [imperative for feminists to speak out]{.underline}
about such issues in public and demand that they be stopped. It was
moving to see the care with which women had created their altars,
placing photos and women's names among flowers, candles, and colorful
fabrics.7 Participants made brief presentations about these items as a
way to explain each issue and to recognize the work of organizations
that oppose these blatant violations of women's human rights.
[Sharing]{.underline} these harrowing [**stories** was an **inspiring
way to connect** struggles **across racial, ethnic, and national
lines**---an **opportunity for learning**, networking, **and affirming
shared beliefs about** **social justice and** **human
integrity**]{.underline}. Contexts and Frameworks In my experience,
teaching for social justice [requires focus and patience]{.underline}.
**[[It takes work to go against the grain.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It may
carry unacceptable personal and professional risks, especially for those
responsible for children and other family members. As well as personal
conviction, feminist scholars and teachers also need contexts that
sustain us in this work. I am grateful for the support and encouragement
I have received over the years from department chairs, colleagues,
students, editors, and publishers. Also, I have benefitted enormously
from working with Women for Genuine Security, a small but vibrant
political community that is part of the International Women's Network
Against Militarism (Cachola et al. 2010).8 As teachers concerned with
social justice, we are up against the teachings of the corporate media,
right-wing talk shows, the stereotypes circulating in news reports and
popular culture, and the echo chamber of social media. An iconic figure
like Dr. [Martin Luther King Jr. has been reduced to a "dreamer" by the
news networks, while his hard-hitting speech]{.underline} linking "[the
giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism"]{.underline} is
far less well known (King 1967). We are up against endless distractions,
shorter attention spans, the price of tuition and textbooks, and other
economic pressures students face. [We are up against everyday
psychological explanations that see inequality and injustice in terms of
low-self esteem, poor identity development, learned helplessness, or a
few "bad apples" that spoil the barrel.]{.underline} We juggle these
considerations as we construct our courses, create assignments, and help
students to absorb class materials, [including structural analyses
necessary to explain these systems of oppression]{.underline}.9 As well
as identifying complexities and contradictions, intersectional feminist
theorizing reminds us that academia was not set up to promote social
justice, despite the development of fields like ethnic studies, women's
and gender studies, and queer studies that embrace this goal. As
National Women's Studies Association (NWSA) members know, these programs
were created as a result of strong social movements and student demands.
Determined faculty members generated the intellectual rationale for
them. They negotiated with university administrators, got curriculum
committees to approve courses, made connections across academic
departments, and so on. In turn, they have needed Deans willing to
validate such programs and direct resources to them. In the past twenty
years, the political climate for WGS on campuses and in the wider
society has become more challenging as misogynist, racist, and
xenophobic viewpoints have gained ground through official rhetoric,
legislation, policy, and the narrowing of public discourse.
Increasingly, faculty members may face challenges to their teaching
methods and course content; their work may be written off as "biased,"
unscholarly, or politically motivated (Nisenson 2017). Indeed, such
attacks on academic freedom have made many teachers' lives more
difficult, in some cases seriously affecting their physical and mental
health, even leading to dismissal. Also, academic institutions have
become increasingly beholden to corporate funding and values. Budget
cuts, department mergers, and the fact that two-thirds of faculty are on
part-time or temporary contracts these days all affect the organization
and viability of interdisciplinary programs like women's and gender
studies. These turbulent times make the political nature of education
explicit. [It is crucial that we organize collectively on campuses and
in communities to support teaching for social justice, and that we are
part of strong, vocal, professional organizations that also do
this.]{.underline} Tenured or tenure-track faculty must challenge the
normalization of contingent labor and the professional and economic
vulnerability of the many teachers hired on short-term contracts
(Betensky 2017). As a community of feminist scholars and teachers, we
must support those whose work is threatened by conservative voices and
organizations on and off campus. We should help support feminist
activist writers who have contributed to scholarship, teaching, and
course materials over the years without regular remuneration for this.
We should urge other professional associations to do the same. I believe
our job as feminist scholars and teachers is to think big, to help
provide spaces where students and community members can confront current
challenges, and where they are affirmed as people who care about social
justice, not based on guilt or pity, but as part of a "common context of
struggle."10 Ethnic studies, women's and gender studies, and queer
studies programs have all contributed to such understandings and
communities of praxis. [A silver lining in this wild time is that even
as some political spaces are being closed down, new social movements are
opening up others. The strong tradition of organizing for social justice
in this country as well as the many efforts currently underway need to
be much better known]{.underline}. [They provide lessons, models, and
inspiration.]{.underline} [We cannot afford to despair or to nurture
despair in others. We must continue to work for and hold out the
possibility of progressive change even as past gains are being attacked
and unraveled.]{.underline} In this regard, the 2018 NWSA conference
theme, Just Imagine, Imagining Justice, is well chosen. A focus on
values, beliefs, and visions is much needed in these challenging times.
In October 2018, a **[Women's March on the Pentagon seeks to refocus
national attention on the immense costs of militarism at home and
abroad]{.underline}**.11 [The organizers highlight the fact that both
major political parties support war and militarism, and see the March as
a call for a radical redefinition of security.]{.underline} Working for
social justice means taking on the world as it is currently constructed.
We need all our passion, creativity, skills, life experience, and the
conviction that things can and must be organized differently, based on
justice and love. How does your work contribute to such a vision? Who
and what inspire you to do it? Who are your allies and accomplices? How
do you cope with the challenges you face? What new processes, tools, and
understandings do we need to create, as feminist scholars and teachers,
to help us move forward?

Mairead Maguire to the International Conference against US/NATO Military
Bases https://cpnn-world.org/new/?p=14245

Dear Friends, It is good to be here with you all. I would like to thank
the organizers for inviting me to address the conference. Firstly I
thank you all for your work for peace. It is good that we will have an
opportunity in the next few days to get to know each other and together
discuss what kind of a world we want to live in? There will be many
different perspectives on this and the way forward, but let us agree to
respect each other and to engage in deep listening and conversation no
matter how hard and where the dialogue might take us! Let us be
encouraged by the fact that we have made an important first step when we
agree to enter into dialogue, and when we agree that peace is both the
means and the great achievable gift. [**It would be wonderful too no
matter what area of social/political change we work in**, if we can
unite on a shared vision of **a demilitarized world and find strength in
agreeing we will not limit ourselves to civilizing and slowing down
militarism, but demanding its total abolition. Some people might argue
that peace is not possible in such a highly militarized world. However,
I believe that peace is both possible and urgent. It is achievable when
we each become impassioned about peace** and filled with an ethic that
makes peace our objective and we each put into practice our moral sense
of political/social responsibility to build peace and justice. **To
build peace we are challenged to reject the bomb, the bullet, and all
the techniques of violence.**]{.underline} Unfortunately, we are
constantly bombarded with the glorification of militarism and war;
therefore building a culture of peace and nonviolence will not be an
easy task.  We are hearing about the building of a European army and we
are asked to accept austerity and budget cuts to our health, education,
etc. whilst increasing money to our own armies and also European
military expansion. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization-NATO, which
should have been disbanded when the Warsaw Pact was dissolved, continue
to carry out wars and proxy wars in many countries pushing towards the
borders of Russia and resurrecting a cold war between the East and West.
I believe that NATO should be disbanded and should be made accountable
and make restitutions to the millions of people in countries such as
Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and many others it has illegally attacked,
invaded, destroyed[.  We will never be allowed by our governments, or
our mainstream media, to hear many of the stories of the lives of so
many civilians killed by US/NATO forces.  NATO forces have targeted and
assassinated individuals and entire families.]{.underline}

# Root cause

## RC -- War

**Militarism institutes warfare as a state of being - \"deterrence\" is
a myth that implies war is temporary, denying our existence in a
constant state of war**

**Gelot and Sandor, 19** (Linnea Gelot and Adam Sandor, 12-5-2019,
accessed on 7-17-2022, Conflict, Security & Development, \"African
Security and Global Militarism\",
https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14678802.2019.1688959)

The concept's intuitive nature, however, obscures two important features
of threat governance in contemporary African politics. First, as pointed
out by Frowd and Sandor, **while militarisation aims to capture
processes of change in the legitimation and extension of military power,
it nevertheless lacks the analytical flexibility necessary to bring into
view varied practices and different forms of violence associated with
contemporary interventions. For example,** it is increasingly the case
that **interventions operationalised in Africa by leading states,
international organisations and NGOs, including those that involve the
military, engage in various forms of 'armed social
work'.**[^20^](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14678802.2019.1688959) The
**pursuit of such practices, however, does not always signal a logic of
war preparation and military power, but rather one of pastoral forms of
power and selective (in)security. In other words, military actors are
not always involved in martial pursuits, but the pursuit of such
practices are nearly always defined or informed by logics of security,
notably human security.** Secondly, if militarisation constitutes the
entrenchment of society's acceptance of military approaches to resolving
problems, such that it affects all aspects of our everyday lives, then
how do we know when that process is operative from when it is not?
Certainly, we live with the complex legacies of past military practices
and ideologies, even if today they are not presently operative or
immediately coercive. Yet, when researchers use the Internet to research
African politics, or communicate at a distance via WhatsApp with African
interlocutors, does this constitute the militarisation of our everyday
lives since these technologies were originally developed by military
institutions? Indeed, if it is so inexorably pervasive, how can we
analytically disentangle a civilian-centred society constituted by banal
acts such as these from military-centred ones that regularise the
constant possibility of the use of martial force? We pose these
questions to highlight tensions in the concept of militarisation. Its
theorisation in the literature has signified a set of processes that
blurs political phenomena and boundaries like the public and private,
police and military, and inside and outside. Nevertheless, as a concept
it ultimately struggles to escape the rigidities of those distinctions
and categories. The Special Issue equally shares the questions (posed as
a critique) advanced by Anna Stavrianakis and Maria Stern: 'if
disciplines and practices central to civilian and military life grew up
together, is it appropriate to talk of militarisation, as though
ostensibly civilian practices were not already enmeshed with military
power, itself central to the constitution of social order and the
state?'[^21^](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14678802.2019.1688959) **Militari*sation* implies
some pre-war, peaceful, normal state of affairs when war and its

itself.**[^22^](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14678802.2019.1688959)** This
is not to say that societal transformations regarding the use of force
(e.g. militarisation, demilitarisation and the like) do not occur, or
will not occur in the future. Our point is to stress that war, security
and society have always been mutually imbricated, and that studying the
use of force should always involve giving full recognition of those
imbrications. Only by fully recognising this can we capture the diverse
forms of political violence operating in and on transnationalised
African spaces.** There is a danger that some usages of militarisation
to explain the governance of threats in/on Africa result in an
underestimation of war-like forms of politics because **it blithely
assumes that war is somehow an historical and social aberration in
African settings, or elsewhere. The same danger applies as a result of
frequent unquestioning usages of security as a predominant guiding
concept**. That said, an IPS approach to militarism that takes war and
security into account can carve out analytical room for a fluidity in
our use of concepts; that is, the possibility exists to pursue careful
treatments of these concepts that successfully navigate a middle ground.

**Militarism is the root cause of ALL war in the current era**

Whatever the broader social implications of the invasion of Iraq and
American militarism may be, if one only takes the view that committing
war crimes with vast and terrible human consequences should be avoided,
then understanding the sociological causes of war in the United States
may be necessary for preventing such paroxysms of violence in the
future. This is especially true if the **causes of** the invasion of
**Iraq were systemic** and structural, enduring features of our society,
the same as at other times when the United States used military force.
Indeed, many analysts (e.g. Mann 2003; Dorrien 2004) have insisted or
implied that the Iraq War was unique in that the Bush administration's
unilateral assault on Iraq was rooted in a militaristic foreign policy
ideology that advocated offensive military aggression and American
global domination, whereas American defense policy has traditionally
been more multilateral, defensive, and benign. I argue, on the contrary,
that the **invasion of Iraq** sprang **from** the **same impulses** of
powerful individuals and institutional configurations that have led the
United States **to war throughout the entire post-World War II period**.
Preventing illegal or otherwise unnecessary wars in the future, then,
requires at the very least a correct understanding of the patterns of
social behavior and institutions that cause them. That is, it requires
having the right theoretical explanation at hand to inform public policy
and activism. Strengths and Weaknesses of the Research Design: Because
understanding patterns of behavior and institutional effects implies a
study of multiple cases, one significant weakness of this inquiry is the
singular focus on the case of the Iraq War. This study must be
supplemented by studies of American involvement in other conflicts to
prove the validity of the theory across all or most cases. The aim of
this study is only to demonstrate the relative superiority of the elite
model of war mobilization relative to the alternatives offered by
sociologists. To the extent that this is achieved, this study will at
least strongly suggest needed public policy changes and avenues for
future research and teaching.

#### Militarization causes and enforces the structure for ecological destruction

**[The U.S. military contributes significantly to ecological catastrophe
and prevents the realization of a more ecological
society]{.underline}**. First, we consider the direct environmental
impacts. The **[U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is the single largest
consumer of energy and the largest institutional consumer of oil in the
world, using billions of gallons of fuel annually]{.underline}**
(Eisenscher, 2014; Steichen and Koshgarian, 2020). **[Energy use for
daily operations of the DoD, approaching 400,000 barrels of oil, exceeds
that of any other private or public organization as well as more than
100 nations]{.underline}** (Crawford, 2019; Reisch and Kretzmann, 2008;
Warner and Singer, 2009). Military vehicles, from tanks, fighter jets
and bombers, to battleships and aircraft carriers consume
petroleum-based fuels at extraordinarily high rates; for example, four
to eight miles per gallon of diesel fuel for HUMVEEs, just over half a
mile per gallon for tanks, 134 barrels per hour for non-nuclear aircraft
carriers, four gallons of jet fuel per nautical mile for B-2 Bombers and
25 gallons per minutes for F-15 fighter jets (Crawford, 2019;
Eisenscher, 2014). Indirect applications would further account for fuel
consumed by private contractors and weapons manufacturing**[. While U.S.
average per capita energy use is already among the highest in the
world]{.underline}** \[https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-cap
ita-energy-use\], **[the per capita rate for active-duty military and
civilian personnel is 35% higher still than this average. The
corresponding emissions amount to 59 million metric tons of greenhouse
gases annually, the single largest volume of produced emissions in the
world, even exceeding that of industrialized countries such as Sweden,
Denmark, and Portugal. Since 2001, the U.S. military has emitted 1.2
billion metric tons of greenhouse gases and is one of the highest
emitters historically]{.underline}** (Crawford, 2019**[). Further, it
would not be possible for fossil-fuel-dependent global production and
consumption levels to keep growing and to remain so high without the U.
S. military war machine deploying missions to protect oil
supplies.]{.underline}** Up to **[one half of all interstate wars since
have been driven by this purpose]{.underline}**, though often not
officially (Steichen and Koshgarian, 2020). [**Intimidation and threat
of military action and violence undergird the dynamics of uneven power
relations between, on the one hand, Global North state interests to
secure their levels of consumption, and on the other hand, communities
often in the Global South, whose lands and livelihoods are devastated by
the extractive industries and infrastructure protected by the
military.** **Compounding and obfuscating the situation is the absence
of military greenhouse gas emissions in global climate negotiations and
agreements, resulting in a highly inaccurate depiction of the scale of
the problem that these enormous international efforts seek to
solve**]{.underline} (Steichen and Koshgarian, 2020). This absence is
not an accidental oversight. In 1997, the U.S. team at the United
Nations climate talks in **[Kyoto, Japan, successfully lobbied for
exemptions from requirements in emission reductions for the military.
Even though the U.S. did not even ratify the Kyoto Protocol, military
exemptions remained for all the nations that did sign, and continue to
present day]{.underline}** (Buxton, 2015). Many U.S. military practices
are also ecologically destructive and have wreaked havoc on the local
environments where they operate. **[The very notion of ecocide, as the
mass destruction and extermination of ecosystems, arose in the context
of the U.S. military's devastating use of the chemical weapon Agent
Orange in Vietnam (]{.underline}**Falk, 1973; Higgins, 2015). **[More
recently, the toxicity accumulated from using depleted uranium munitions
and burning trash in open pits during military operations in Afghanistan
and Iraq has resulted in high incidences of crippling birth defects and
cancer among civilians in both places]{.underline}** (Webb, 2017;
Hussain, 2019). **[Even if we were to accept the rather dubious notion
that military operations have strengthened the cause of democracy in
these parts of the world and solidified U.S. security, their devastated
environments result in huge losses to local livelihoods. A cascading
effect is that these governments and societies become further entrapped
and dependent on international aid while instability is perpetuated. The
financial instruments arising from these foreign aid regimes are
structured by geopolitically powerful countries to extend their
neocolonial power over those already enduring ongoing dispossession,
extraction, and marginalization]{.underline}** (Hickel, 2018).

## RC -- Violence

#### Militarism paints human existence as nothing more than war and individuals are essentially agents of violence

**Marzec 9** (Robert P., Associate Professor of English literature and
postcolonial studies at Purdue University, and associate editor of
Modern Fiction Studies. The Global South, Volume 3, Number 1,
"Militariality" Spring 2009. Project Muse AD 7/9/09) JM

These stratocratic **[controls of planetary human activity reveal more
than the ideology of a single administration; they are an extension of
what we can now see as the complete devotion to an apparatus that
captures all cultural and political energies in terms of]{.underline}**
what Clausewitz defined as "**[policy]{.underline}**."
**[The]{.underline}** original **[state of "emergency"]{.underline}** as
defined by the Bush Administration in the wake of the World Trade Center
and Pentagon attacks **[has been naturalized and sedimented as to become
a fundamental starting point of human existence]{.underline}**.
Consequently, understanding the full intensity of the age of
militariality requires more than the common critical awareness of
Clausewitz's central doctrine: **["War is merely the continuation of
policy by other means"]{.underline}** (28). It requires first an
understanding that for Clausewitz, war is the very ontological basis of
human existence, a basis that transcends culture, history and
temporality. **[War defines the very structure of human
subjectivity]{.underline}**, a juridico-natural "code of law" that is
"deeply rooted" in a people, an army, a government: "**[war is a
paradoxical trinity---composed of primordial violence, hatred, and
enmity]{.underline}**, which are to be regarded as a blind natural
force; of the play of chance and probability within which the creative
spirit is free to roam; and of its element of subordination, as an
instrument of policy" (30). Clausewitz assigns a constituency to each of
the registers of this trinity: "The first of these...mainly concerns the
people; the second the commander and his army; the third the government"
(30). **[In]{.underline}** a totalizing problematic organized according
to **[the idea of war serving as the basis of human existence, the
people of a nation are equated with that of a blind primordial force of
violence]{.underline}**: "the first," which refers to "primordial vio-
lence, hatred, and enmity" identifies the people living in the nation.
"Government" therefore names that entity constituted for the exclusive
purpose of controlling its unstable citizenry by reorienting the
energies of the people to- wards warfare. **[This reorientation lays the
groundwork and delineates the horizon of human creativity, and
determines the single legitimized space of freedom:]{.underline}** the
army, where the "creative spirit is free to roam." The space of in-
stability, of chance, which is the condition for the possibility of
creativity, en- ters into the war-footing picture of reality only on
this register of militarized human activity. This connection here is not
a matter of association; **[military activity defines the very essence
of freedom and human creativity.]{.underline}** The army and its state
are not defined in this picture in traditional terms of democracy,
protection, and service to a people. Nor are they the a sign of the
discourse of biopower, for biopower has its eyes on the productivity of
a population and functions according to a general administration of life
that, although affecting "distributions around a norm," still invites
and produces a certain amount of heterogeneity (Foucault 266).

####  The drive to militarize destroys the value to life -- We live life in our seatbelts instead of embracing the things that make life worth living. Their method only locks us in a cycle of violence and counter-violence 

**Der Derian 98** (James, Prof of PoliSci at the U of Massachusetts,
\"The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche, and Baudrillard,\"
Cianet, http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html, AD:
7/10/09) jl

**[The desire for security is manifested as a collective resentment of
difference\--that which is not us, not certain, not
predictable.]{.underline}** Complicit with a negative will to power is
the fear-driven desire for protection from the unknown. Unlike the
positive will to power, which produces an aesthetic affirmation of
difference, **[the search for truth produces a truncated life which
conforms to the rationally knowable]{.underline}**, to the causally
sustainable. In The Gay Science , Nietzsche asks of the reader: \"Look,
isn\'t our need for knowledge precisely this need for the familiar, the
will to uncover everything strange, unusual, and questionable, something
that no longer disturbs us? Is it not the instinct of fear that bids us
to know? And is the jubilation of those who obtain knowledge not the
jubilation over the restoration of a sense of security?\"
[37](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note37)
**[The fear of the unknown and the desire for certainty]{.underline}**
combine to **[produce a domesticated life, in which causality and
rationality become the highest sign of a sovereign self,]{.underline}**
the surest protection against contingent forces. The fear of fate
assures a belief that everything reasonable is true, and everything
true, reasonable. In short, **[the security imperative produces, and is
sustained by, the strategies of knowledge which seek to explain
it]{.underline}**. Nietzsche elucidates the nature of this generative
relationship in The Twilight of the Idols : The causal instinct is thus
conditional upon, and excited by, **[the feeling of fear]{.underline}**.
The \"why?\" shall, if at all possible, not give the cause for its own
sake so much as for a particular kind of cause \--a cause that is
comforting, liberating and relieving. . . . That which is new and
strange and has not been experienced before, is excluded as a cause.
Thus one not **[only searches for some kind of explanation, to serve as
a cause, but for a particularly selected and preferred kind of
explanation\--that which most quickly and frequently abolished the
feeling of the strange, new and hitherto unexperienced: the most
habitual explanations]{.underline}**.
[38](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note38) A
safe life requires safe truths. The strange and the alien remain
unexamined, **[the unknown becomes identified as evil, and evil provokes
hostility\--recycling the desire for security]{.underline}**. The
\"influence of timidity,\" as Nietzsche puts it, creates a people who
are willing to subordinate affirmative values to the \"necessities\" of
security: \"**[they fear change, transitoriness: this expresses a
straitened soul, full of mistrust and evil experiences.]{.underline}**\"
[39](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note39) The
unknowable which cannot be contained by force or explained by reason is
relegated to the off-world. \"**[Trust,\" the \"good]{.underline}**,\"
and other common values **[come to rely upon an \"artificial strength\":
\"the feeling of security]{.underline}** such as the Christian
possesses; he feels strong in being able to trust, to be patient and
composed: he owes this artificial strength to the illusion of being
protected by a god.\"
[40](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note40) For
Nietzsche, of course, only **[a false sense of security can come from
false gods:]{.underline}** \"Morality and religion belong altogether to
the psychology of error : in every single case, cause and effect are
confused; or truth is confused with the effects of believing something
to be true; or a state of consciousness is confused with its causes.\"
[41](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note41)
Nietzsche\'s interpretation of the origins of religion can shed some
light on this paradoxical origin and transvaluation of security. In The
Genealogy of Morals , Nietzsche sees religion arising from a sense of
fear and indebtedness to one\'s ancestors: **[The conviction reigns that
it is only through the sacrifices and accomplishments of the ancestors
that the tribe exists \--and that one has to pay them back with
sacrifices and accomplishments: one thus recognizes a debt  that
constantly grows greater, since these forebears never cease, in their
continued existence as powerful spirits, to accord the tribe new
advantages and new strength]{.underline}**.

[**[In the contemporary context of globalization, militarism has become
what David Theo Goldberg calls a \"new regime of truth,\" a new
epistemology defining what is fact and fiction]{.mark}**, right and
wrong, just and unjust (qtd. in S. Giroux)]{.underline}. **[[Not only
are Americans obsessed with military power, but \"it has become central
to our national identity\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Bacevich 1). How else
to explain the fact that the United States now has \"725 official
military bases outside the country and 969 at home\" or that it \"spends
more on \'defense\' than all the rest of the world put together\" (Judt
16)? As President Bush explained at a news conference on April 13, 2004,
and has repeated again and again in different public venues as 2006 has
unfolded, \"[This country must go on the offense and stay on the
offense\" (qtd. in Judt 16). By regarding military power as the highest
expression of social truth and national greatness, the Bush
*administration* has opened a dangerous new chapter in American military
history that now gives unfettered support to what C. Wright Mills has
called a \"\'military metaphysics\' - the cast of mind that defines
international reality as basically military\" (222). As Andrew Bacevich
indicates, this mentality leads to a \"tendency to see international
problems as military problems and to discount the likelihood of finding
a solution except through military means\"]{.underline} (2). Similarly,
Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri point out in Multitude that in the
current era war has become the organizing principle of society and the
foundation for politics and other social relations (12-3). Broadly
speaking, [militarization refers to the related instances of the
increasing centrality of the military in American society, the
militarization of U.S. culture, and the **[growing propensity to
suppress dissent.]{.mark}** The process of militarization has a long
history in the United States and is varied rather than static, changing
under different historical conditions.12 The **[militarizing of public
space at home contributes to the narrowing of community and an
escalating concentration of unaccountable political power that threatens
the very foundation of democracy in the United States. Militarization is
no longer simply the driving force of foreign policy, it has become a
defining principle for social changes at home]{.mark}.** Catherine Lutz

[Joint

to a nascent mob in Washington on Jan. 6, he wasn't talking about moral
force. **In militarized societies, the model of political change is
often military**]{.underline}. War is the assertion of "might makes
right," the negation of the rule of law. Political scientists worry
these days about democratic erosion, when the norms and institutions of
previously stable representative democracies decline. We usually ponder
the causes of erosion in other countries. Democracy is, on one hand,
democratic elections where the people decide who will govern them, and
processes for horizontal and vertical oversight and accountability.
There is also a deeper conception of democracy --- the norms of citizen
deliberation, and human and civil rights that guarantee expression,
inclusion and collective action. Democratic legitimacy depends on the
ability of citizens to engage in public reason. The more democratic a
society is, the greater the limits it has on the use of force both at
home and abroad. We don't take out weapons to resolve our disputes.
Democratic erosion or backsliding occurs when democratic institutions,
norms and values are gradually --- and sometimes almost imperceptibly
--- reduced. Democratic erosion includes the decline of competitive
elections, the reduction in forums where citizens can deliberate and
form policy preferences, and the diminished ability for accountability.
The indicators of erosion also include constraints on freedom of the
press, which reduces transparency and accountability, the unchecked
accretion of power in the executive branch, and the loss of civil
rights, including the right of assembly. Democratic erosion has various
causes. Some blame power-hungry executives who don't want to give up
power. The question, here, is why democratic institutions aren't able to
stop power-hungry elites who would concentrate power and economic
resources. [Suzanne Mettler and Robert Lieberman, in their book "[Four
Threats](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250244420)," also highlight
excessive executive power but then add political polarization,
[racism]{.mark} and nativism, and [economic inequality]{.mark} that
prompts the wealthy to mobilize to protect their position. **[War and
militarism exacerbate all those things]{.mark}**. But more than that[,
**war and militarism are**]{.mark} **antipodal and [undermining]{.mark}
of [democratic norms, institutions and practices]{.mark}**[. At the
beginning of the post-9/11 wars, we worried about the effects on our
civil liberties and democrac]{.mark}y. But after nearly 20 years, we've
almost forgotten about these wars and have underappreciated their effect
on our democratic institutions and values**[. The urgency of war is
often used to justify the concentration of executive power and deference
to the executive in times of national emergency]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
In the United States, the trend toward the concentration of power in the
executive was accelerated in the George W. Bush administration. John
Yoo, working for President Bush, argued the legal basis for what he
called the unitary executive theory where, in war, the president's
powers are essentially
[[unchecked]{.underline}](https://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/war_powers_belong_to_the_president).
**[[Other officials excused secrecy and torture because the United
States was at war.]{.underline}]{.mark}** President Trump has continued
in that tradition, acting as if the laws and the rule of law do not
apply to him. President Dwight Eisenhower is usually given credit for
pointing out the dangers of a military industrial complex. Eisenhower
rejected massive conventional forces quite explicitly because he sought
to prevent the United States from becoming a garrison state: If the U.S.
were to do so, [Eisenhower
said](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1952-54v02p1/d120),
"we might as well stop any further talk about preserving a sound U.S.
economy and proceed to transform ourselves forthwith into a garrison
state." Militarization is a perennial concern. James Madison warned in
the [Federalist
Papers](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/full-text) in 1795 that
"Of all the enemies of true liberty, war is, perhaps, the most to be
dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other. ...
[No nation can preserve its freedom in the midst of continual
warfare]{.underline}." Madison worried that "war is in fact the true
nurse of executive aggrandizement" that could increase public debt and
lead to a "degeneracy in manners and morals." George Washington, in his
1796 [farewell
address](https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=15&page=transcript),
urged Americans to protect their union and "avoid the necessity of those
overgrown military establishments which, under any form of government,
are inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as
particularly hostile to republican liberty." In war, fear is often part
of the equation --- and fear may be deliberately heightened, threats
inflated. We have been living in fear for nearly two decades. When

#### The War in Afghanistan cost the US trillions and corruption. 

**WILPF 21** -- Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, 2021
("Militarism And Afghanistan: Costs And Profits," *WILPF,* December 2,
available online at
<https://www.wilpf.org/militarism-and-afghanistan-costs-and-profits/>,
accessed 07/13/2022)

The Death, Destruction and Other Deliverables blog explored the various
forms of violence that have resulted from [[the past twenty years of war
in Afghanistan]{.mark}, including [the]{.mark} use of explosive weapons
in populated areas, drone strikes, torture, special operations, and the
broader harms caused by the "Global War on Terror"]{.underline}. These
brutal costs of war run in parallel to the economic costs.

None of the violence described in the Death, Destruction and Other
Deliverables blog has been cheap. The Cost of War Project at Brown
University estimates that [the war in Afghanistan [cost the United
States \$2.3 trillion to date]{.mark}. The governments of other
countries participating in the invasion and occupation have also spent
billions: [the U]{.mark}nited [K]{.mark}ingdom [spent]{.mark} about
[\$28.2 billion]{.mark}, [Canada about \$13 billion]{.mark}, [Germany
about \$11 billion, Italy about \$9 billion]{.mark}, [France about \$4
billion]{.mark}, Australia about 10 billion AUD, [Norway about 11.5
billion]{.mark} [NOK]{.mark}.]{.underline}

More broadly, as noted by the National Priorities Project in its report
State of Insecurity: [[The Cost of Militarization Since 9/11]{.mark},
since 2001 the US government [has spent more than \$21]{.mark}
[trillion]{.mark} at home and overseas on militaristic policies that led
to the creation of a vast surveillance apparatus, worsened mass
incarceration, [intensified the war on immigrant communities, and caused
incalculable human suffering in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Libya,
Somalia, and elsewhere.]{.mark}]{.underline}

But for all that it has cost taxpayers in the United States and other
occupying countries, the profits from the war in Afghanistan have been
seemingly limitless.

War Profiteering

[[The S]{.mark}ecurity [P]{.mark}olicy [R]{.mark}eform
[I]{.mark}nstitute [found that US Congress gave \$2.02]{.mark} [trillion
to the top five weapons companies]{.mark} ---]{.underline} Raytheon,
Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Boeing and Northrop Grumman ---
between 2001 and 2021. [[During]{.mark} the war in [Afghanistan]{.mark},
[the top five weapons firms spent \$1 billion lobbying Congress and
received \$2 trillion in Pentagon contracts.]{.mark} [That's \$1,813 in
Pentagon contracts for every dollar]{.mark} [spent]{.mark} on lobbying
--- a 181,214 per cent return on investment.]{.underline}

[Private military and security companies (PMSCs) have also profited from
the wars.]{.underline} A recent study by Brown University shows that
much of the growth in US military budgets since 2001 is due to payments
to military contractors. [[Contractors received about \$104
billion]{.mark} for services in Afghanistan since 2002, including
[nearly \$9 billion]{.mark} just [in]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [last]{.mark}
[five]{.mark} [years]{.mark}.]{.underline} Some engage in military and
security operations, including "interrogation" (such as the CIA's
torture program); others handle laundry, food services, transportation,
and construction, employing foreign nationals and paying them less than
US employees. In Afghanistan, contractors outnumbered US soldiers. At
its peak in 2011, there were about 90,000 contractors in Afghanistan; by
the withdrawal in 2021, about 17,000 contractors were still in the
country.

#### The 1AC's language perpetuates and normalizes militarism as a cultural system and stuff yay

**Gusterson and Besteman 19** (Hugh, Professor in the Department of
Anthropology and Elliott School of International Affairs of George

Supplement 19") // Ilake LT🐣

In contrast, [anthropologists' interest in militarism has taken shape in
the context of post--cold war transformations in the management of
violence]{.underline}. These years have seen the violent reorganization
of some cold war client states; the proliferation of militia-led
insurgencies; the interpenetration of organized crime and drug
trafficking with insurgency and counter in-surgency in parts of the
global south; the articulation of coun-ter insurgency abroad with
domestic policing at home in many Western countries; the reformulation
of the [United Nations into an institution of militarized peacekeeping
and occupation]{.underline}; the [increasing use of military labor to
perform civil, humanitarian, policing, and development activities; and a
growing awareness of the ways in which militarism as a set of cultural
practices and ideologies **pervades all domains of social life**. The
anthropologists in this volume see **militarism as a cultural
system**]{.underline}; [it is shaped through ideology and rhetoric,
effected through bodies and technologies, made visible and invisible
through campaigns of imagery and knowledge production, and it
**colonizes aspects of social life including reproduction, self-image,
and notions of community**]{.underline}. We interrogate militarism in
its established and emergent forms, probing its genealogies, its
facility at colonizing daily life, and its ability to present itself as
a response to insecurities it has itself provoked.4This collection of
papers draws on the rich discussions at the symposium from which this
volume emerged to capture some of the distinctive features of cultures
of militarism. The papers emphasize militarization as a contingent
process over militarism as a measurable object;5decenter the state as
the core locus of such processes; probe the relationship between
militarism, experience, and identity, with a special focus on the body;
examine connections between militarism and social injustice; and evince
a commitment to critique and under-mine militarism while, at the same
time, respecting the force of its appeal. The New Anthropology of
Militarism: Four Features Threat Constructions These papers understand
[militarism as a process rather than as a bounded, measurable thing
enmeshed in deterministic relationships with other reified
variables]{.underline}. [Militarism as an in-flective force or bundle of
processes acts upon society in pow-erful and expansive but uneven and
contingent ways]{.underline}. Although [militarism carves its way deep
into social structures, it is also shaped and reshaped in the
dialectical interaction between in-grained structures on the one hand
and human agency and contingency on the other]{.underline}. It is
[capillary, shape-shifting, always in motion as it constructs threats,
enrolls constituencies, colonizes cultural life, and generates new loci
of resistance]{.underline}. As Michel Foucault (2007:44) writes,
security apparatuses "have the con-stant tendency to expand; they are
centrifugal. New elements are constantly being integrated\....Security
therefore involves or-ganizing, or anyway allowing the development of
ever-wider circuits." And there is [no domain of social life it does not
touch. Just as contemporary wars seem to have no clearly demarcated end,
so **militarism has no discernible edge**; it **increasingly seeps into
every corner of the** **world**, every aspect of social life, in
someway. Military/intelligence logics and personnel are now being
directed to manage arenas of life formerly understood as outside the
purview of the military, like development projects in Africa,
humanitarian aid, and responses to environmental catastrophes, black
markets, and the hacking of political parties' computers]{.underline}.
In the words of Catherine Lutz, one of the foremost anthropological
theorists and observers of militarism, the [process of militariza-tion"
has reshaped almost every element of global social life over the 20th
century]{.underline}." It involves an intensification of the labor and
resources allocated to military purposes, including the shaping of other
institu-tions in synchrony with military goals. Militarization is
simul-taneously a discursive process, involving a shift in general
societal beliefs and values in ways necessary to legitimate the use of
force, the organization of large standing armies and their leaders, and
the higher taxes or tribute used to pay for them. Militarization is
intimately connected not only to the obvious increase in the size of
armies and resurgence of mil-itant nationalisms and militant
fundamentalisms but also to the less visible deformation of human
potentials into the hierarchies of race, class, gender, and sexuality,
and to the shaping of national histories in ways that glorify and
legiti-mate military action. (Lutz 2002:723)As Lutz's comment indicates,
the [material base of militarism is connected with ideologies and
discourses through which proliferating **militarized infrastructures and
rationalities are normalized, naturalized, and legitimized**. Such
ideologies and discourses **valorize the ethos of the
warrior**]{.underline} (Gibson 1994; Orr2004; Webb 2018) and [construct
threats in such a way as to validate military spending, military
interventions, and the mil-itarization of formerly nonmilitary arenas of
life]{.underline}. To say that threats are "constructed" does not mean
that they are imaginary or unreal. But [threats can be figured through
different narratives and addressed in different ways, and the choice of
narrative figuration may have enormous material
consequences]{.underline}. The So-viet missiles deployed to Cuba in 1962
were quite real and, if used, would have inflicted crushing damage on
the United States. But the United States could have chosen to regard
them as a reasonable counterweight to its own Jupiter nuclear-tipped
mis-siles in Turkey, on the Soviet Union's doorstep, rather than
pro-voking a global crisis by narrating them as an existential threat
(Weldes 1999). Likewise, based on the evidence of the last 2 de-cades of
US-Vietnamese relations, the United States could plausibly have decided
in the 1960s that its vital interests would have suffered little if a
small country on the other side of the planet were allowed to "go
Communist. "Instead, it fruitlessly expended the lives of over 50,000
Americans and 2--3 million Vietnamese in what American national security
elites wrongly perceived, thanks to the consensually accepted domino
theory, as a struggle it could not afford to lose. Or, as discussed in
this volume, Turkey in the early twentieth century could have
constructed Armenians as constituency to be accommodated, not
exterminated, and Guatemalan and Colombian elites could have constructed
rural challenges against inequality and injustice as a social problem to
address through development and land reform, not a military threat that
demanded counterinsurgency. [In these cases, the preferred threat
constructions militarized the problems at hand, mobilizing more
resources for military projects and saturating the social field with
militarized violence.]{.underline}

#### INCOMPLETE \-\-\-- Further US-NATO support promotes disastrous militarism, greenlighting a laundry list of impacts that feed the military industrial complex. 

<https://natowatch.org/default/2022/militarism-cannot-prevent-war-urgent-call-de-escalation-demilitarisation-and>

[Behind this current crisis lies a history of militarised and economic
violence]{.underline}. Both Russia and [[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [are settler colonial state]{.mark}s, [forging]{.mark}
their [countries by expanding]{.mark} their ["frontiers]{.mark}" and
killing and repressing Indigenous populations. Both [engage in
imperialist actions]{.mark} outside of their now-established borders,
interfering, [through military and economic action]{.mark}, in countries
they deem to be within their "spheres of influence". Both [use
**militarism, aggression, and forced econ**]{.mark}**omic
[ties]{.mark}** to guide their conduct in international relations, and
both [deal with]{.mark} domestic [inequality, poverty, and resistance
through **policing**]{.mark} **and punishment**.]{.underline}

The governments of both countries critique each other for the same type
of behaviour. Russia criticises US imperialism, yet invades and occupies
its neighbours, bombs civilians, and engages in cyber-attacks against
critical infrastructure that harm ordinary people. [[The U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates criticises Russia as an autocracy yet **[overthrows
democratic]{.mark}ally elected [governments]{.mark}** if they threaten
US interests, [**builds military bases** and **engages in wars**]{.mark}
**and military operations [in hundreds of countries]{.mark}** around the
world, and **spends billions of dollars a year on militarism** while so
many of its [**citizens live without health care, housing, or food
security**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Both countries have built up their militaries, military alliances, and
nuclear arsenals to challenge the other. [The North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO)'s expansion eastward is about constraining Russia,
just like Russia's invasion of countries to the west are about
constraining NATO. Ukraine, in this context, is a pawn being used by
both "sides".]{.underline}

This gamesmanship runs the serious risk of mass destruction. Between
them, Russia and the United States possess more than 11,850 nuclear
weapons. NATO members France and the United Kingdom have a few hundred
each. The US also stations about 100 nuclear weapons in NATO members
Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, and Turkey. [These weapons are not
remnants of a past Cold War --- they are actively deployed right now,
ready to be used. The stockpile numbers, alarming as they are, don't
convey the sheer horror each weapon packs within it. Every single bomb
is designed to **melt flesh, burn cities, decimate plants and animals,
and unleash radioactive poison** that lasts for generations. Even the
use of one of these weapons would be disastrous. A nuclear exchange
would be catastrophic.]{.underline}

Russia and the United States, along with France, United Kingdom, and
China, together recently agreed that a nuclear war cannot be won and
must never be fought, echoing a statement from Gorbachev and Reagan in
1985. Yet each of these countries has been investing billions in the
"modernisation" and expansion of their nuclear arsenals, preparing not
for nuclear disarmament but for nuclear Armageddon. [Each maintains
doctrines and policies for the use of nuclear weapons.]{.underline} And
some within the US nuclear complex, at least, apparently believe that
nuclear war can be fought --- and won. [This is an incredibly dangerous
message to be sending to those responsible for the potential destruction
of the world, but one that benefits the military-industrial
complex.]{.underline}

[There are other corporate interests behind the festering conflict,
including in relation to weapons production and sale, pipelines and
"energy security," and access to "natural resources," with profits to be
made at the expense of human lives as well as the protection of the
planet. In the midst of a climate emergency, in which capitalist
extraction and exploitation has decimated biodiversity, ecosystems, and
land, water, and air, the governments of NATO members and Russia
continue to use fossil fuels]{.underline} and refuse to embrace a
degrowth economy that would drawdown the use of energy, especially in
the global north, and prioritise the creation of systems of care and
equality for people and planet.

Militarised world order and the abstraction of harm

There is plenty of blame to go around when it comes to the current
crisis and the historical moments that have led us here. All parties
involved have contributed actively to this situation; arguing that one
side or the other has been "provoked" only serves to obscure [the
reality that each of the countries involved have together, deliberately,
**built a militarised, capitalist world order** that exclusively
**serves the interests of the war profiteers** and the **political and
economic elite**.]{.underline}

What is happening right now over Ukraine is bigger than Ukraine.
Tectonic shifts in global geopolitics are taking place and Ukraine is
but one field of "play" for the heavily militarised states.
[Gamesmanship between the United States and China is on the rise; proxy
wars, occupations and aggression, and military and economic pressure is
occuring throughout the world; extraction primarily by the global north
and exploitation of the so-called global south is rampant, exacerbating
and accelerating poverty and inequalities and environmental devestation;
militarism and military spending is on the rise globally. Approaching
the situation in Ukraine without recognising this larger context is like
applying a bandaid to a global hemorrage. It is a piece of a much bigger
puzzle: of a world order dictated and dominated by the militarised
elite.]{.underline}

[This is a world order that sees war as a legitimate means to an end. It
celebrates militarised masculinities, empowering the culture of
militarism and violence as brave and noble pursuits, while rendering
invisible the gendered and racialised harms of militarism. It is a world
order that uses a technostrategic language to sanitise the image of war.
Think tanks and politicians, media, and war gamers act as if countries
are chess pieces and people are numbers on a page. US government
officials, for example, have estimated that a war in Ukraine could kill
25,000 to 50,000 civilians, 5,000 to 25,000 Ukrainian military
personnel, and 3,000 to 10,000 Russian soldiers. The fighting since
2014, in eastern Ukraine it should be noted, has already killed more
than 14,000 people and displaced millions.]{.underline}

[Instead of seeing these people as individuals, whose lives have value
and meaning, who are part of families and communities, **the number
crunchers calculate "acceptable loss" and risks of "collateral
damage,"** and look the other way as the bodies pile up.]{.underline}
Also accounted for is the disruption to daily life --- the interruption
of education, of food production, of supply chains; the destruction of
hospitals, homes, markets, water and sanitation facilitations, and all
of the other critical infrastructure that people rely on to survive.
These numbers don't take into account the psychological terror of living
in conflict, of hearing bombs dropped or drones hovering overhead, of
being afraid to leave your house, of watching loved ones die. These
figures also don't take into account the environmental impacts of war,
the toxic or explosive remnants of weapons, the damage to land and water
and animals.

[These humanitarian and environmental impacts should be at the forefront
of all policy making decisions. Yet they are completely ignored by those
talking in board rooms in capital cities far from where the harm will be
felt, deciding what choices to make for the sake of "geopolitical
strategy" or "balance of power".]{.underline}

#### Militarization is the biggest cause of climate change now; increasing it will kill the environment.

As the world faces war with Iraq, many are understandably concerned with
the immediate horror that war would bring. Beyond these very real
dangers[, [we should take]{.underline}]{.mark} [this
[opportunity]{.mark} [to re-examine whether militarism is a healthy
thing for our society and our planet]{.mark}.]{.underline} Reducing
dependence on the rule of force and [de-militarizing
society]{.underline} would not only make the world more peaceful and
free up resources to address the underlying causes of terrorism, it
[would]{.underline} also [have a dramatically positive impact on global
health and the environment]{.underline}. Here are ten reasons why. [1.
**[Militaries are notorious polluters]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [According
to geographer Joni Seager, "anywhere in the world, [a military presence
is virtually the **single most reliable** predictor of environmental
damage]{.mark}."]{.underline} [Since the end of the Cold War, many plans
to convert military bases to civilian use have been cancelled because
the sites are contaminated beyond any hope of restoration.]{.underline}
[And **military pollution isn't limited to bases, it does significant
damage to the environment at large**. In the US -- the world\'s most
oil-thirsty country -- the largest single consumer of oil is the
Pentagon.]{.underline} Together, the world's [militaries]{.underline}
consume as much petroleum as Japan -- the world\'s second largest
economy -- and [produce an estimated 6-10% of global air
pollution]{.underline}. As Seager concludes: "[Militaries...that have
little else in common share a distinctive environmental sensibility --
namely, one of disregard]{.underline}."1 2. [[Militarism robs other
social needs]{.underline}]{.mark}. As President Dwight Eisenhower said,
"[Every gun that is made, every warship fired, signifies in the final
sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold
and not clothed]{.underline}" -- [and]{.underline}, one should add,
[[pressing environmental needs]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2004, President
Bush hopes to increase the US military budget to \$399.1 billion.
Worldwide military spending -- about \$798 billion in 2000 -- has
recently increased for the first time since the end of the Cold War.
That's a lot of money not spent on finding ways to reduce poverty,
hunger, and environmental degradation. [[Allowing]{.mark} social ills
such as [poverty, illiteracy, and hunger to fester only deepens the
disparities that]{.mark} often [lie at the heart of many environmental
problems.]{.mark}]{.underline} Since militaries are such notorious
polluters, heavy military spending is also a dramatic pollution subsidy.
It fosters a military culture that casts aside environmental concerns as
not "serious" enough to warrant attention. As one American military
commander put it, "**[We're in the business of protecting your country,
not protecting the environment]{.underline}**."2 3. [[Nuclear weapons
are an environmental catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nuclear weapons
pose an environmental threat to humanity unprecedented in human history.
Although the world escaped nuclear holocaust during the Cold War, the
nuclear arms race has not stopped. India and Pakistan now have nuclear
weapons and North Korea may have them as well. According to some
estimates, [[the radiation from weapons testing]{.mark} alone
[will]{.mark} eventually [cause about 2.4 million cancer deaths
worldwide]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Hiroshima and Nagasaki offer a
frightening reminder of the terror of nuclear weapons used in combat. A
year after the US bombed the two cities, 140,000 were dead in Hiroshima
and 70,000 in Nagasaki. Because of the much greater destructive capacity
of modern nuclear weapons, a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan
could kill up to 30 million people]{.underline}. A massive nuclear war
involving half the world's weapons could trigger a worldwide "nuclear
winter," blocking virtually all of the sun's light with debris,
potentially for weeks, threatening everyone not killed directly in the
blasts.3 4. Nuclear waste is an environmental catastrophe. Even if they
are never used, nuclear weapons leave in their wake wastes unlike any
other in human history, remaining deadly for hundreds of thousands --
sometimes millions -- of years. There is no completely safe place for
these wastes over geological time. A volcano erupted just 20 kilometers
from Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where the US plans to store much of its
nuclear waste, only 20,000 years ago, a mere blip on the geological
timeline. Leaving such long-lived waste for future generations is
profoundly irresponsible. [The Soviet military is guilty of probably the
single most egregious failure to contain nuclear waste (although the
American record is far from spotless): dumping waste directly into Lake
Karachay, creating what a Natural Resources Defense Council official has
called "the most polluted spot on the planet." **Standing at the shore
of Lake Karachay for an hour would kill you within
weeks**]{.underline}.4 5. Military toxins poison the poor and people of
color. Those who pay the price for military pollution tend to be
society's weakest and most vulnerable. For decades the US Army
contaminated a poor and largely black neighborhood in Memphis, dumping
chemical weapons and other hazardous toxics without informing the
residents. Pollution by Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio has elevated
the cancer rates and birth defects in the surrounding Latino
neighborhoods. For more than fifty years, the US Navy has contaminated
Vieques, Puerto Rico, leaving residents with cancer rates 26% higher
than the Puerto Rican average. Sadly, the same pattern holds
internationally. As Joni Seager observes, "most nuclear weapons in the
United States and Europe have been tested on indigenous peoples' land
with dramatic health consequences," most severely for women and
children. Even within the US military, soldiers whose health is
threatened by poisonous weapons such as Agent Orange and Depleted
Uranium (DU) -- not to mention combat -- are disproportionately poor and
people of color. For both civilians and the rank and file, the pattern
is clear: the poor and marginalized are poisoned by the pollution of the
rich and powerful.5 6. Militaries are exempt from environmental
regulation. Militaries are routinely exempted from environmental
regulations in the name of "national security". In the US, many major
environmental laws give the military dramatic regulatory loopholes,
including the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Occupational Safety and
Health Act, all laws governing nuclear activity and waste, and many
more. As the Military Toxics Project and the Environmental Health
Coaltion observe, "These exemptions have serious consequences when ...
the Department of Defense and Energy are the nation's leading
polluters." I[nternationally, a treaty banning plastic dumping at sea
explicitly exempts militaries -- despite the fact that the US Navy alone
dumps over 5 tons of plastic overboard daily -- and agreements governing
foreign military bases almost never include provisions for environmental
protection. Although the Pentagon tries to put a green spin on its
activities with initiatives such as "green bullets," which pollute soil
less than conventional lead bullets, it fiercely resists regulation and
aggressively covers up information about its pollution. One person fired
from a military facility for voicing concerns over environmental health
likened the intimidation directed at him to the work of the KGB and the
Gestapo, calling it a "police state". An EPA official once described the
Department of Energy's attitude about regulation of their nuclear
activities as: "Look, Buster, don't bug me with your crap about permits.
I'm building atomic weapons."6 7. War destroys ecosystems and
livelihoods. From "carpet bombing" to "scorched earth" campaigns, war
routinely leave ecosystems ravaged and agricultural livelihoods
destroyed. In the Vietnam War, US Air Force planes that dropped Agent
Orange were emblazoned with the slogan, "Only we can prevent forests."
Beyond the 19 million gallons of Agent Orange, the US dropped some 25
million bombs on South Vietnam, wiping out half of the mangrove forests
and eliminating almost 5 million acres of forest. In Central America,
sociologist Daniel Faber reports that "Vietnam-style 'scorched earth'
operations and military maneuvers have obliterated vast agricultural
lands and crucial ecosystems, pushing millions of refugees into
overcrowded cities and overtaxed hillsides]{.underline}." A US military
official happily reported that in Honduras "you don't need to
worry...about the EPA or...the environmentalists. Those are not concerns
down there."7 8. War destroys health and sanitation infrastructure. War
undermines public health. This grim reality was on full display in the
Gulf War. A UN observation team at the end of the war found that the
"recent conflict has wrought apocalyptical results on the
infrastructure" leaving "means of modern life support...destroyed or
rendered tenuous." By dropping 5,000 tons of bombs, allied forces
destroyed water and sewage facilities, electrical generators, and
communication centers. Raw sewage flowed into drinking water supplies,
and public health systems collapsed. Security scholar Michael Klare
writes that the wrecked "water, electricity, and transportation systems
have resulted in extensive death, disease, and hunger."8 9. [War poisons
many generations of civilians. **[War is the curse that keeps on
killing]{.mark}**. Vietnamese parents and children today are still being
poisoned by the 19 million gallons of Agent Orange the US dumped on them
during the war]{.underline}. Congenital birth defects more than tripled
between 1966 and 1996, while Vietnamese women suffer spontaneous
abortion and cervical cancer at rates among the world's worst. What's
more, the country remains littered with unexploded weaponry. As one
doctor put it, "No one can be certain when the war's remnants will
disappear." In Iraq, allied forces fired between 320 and 350 tons of DU,
and as a result radioactivity has been found in Iraq's ground water and
both plant and animal tissues. The level of damage done by this
"recycled" radioactive waste won't be fully understood for years, but we
know that DU can cause kidney failure, cancers, reproductive problems,
genetic damage, and weakened immune systems. The bombing of Iraq's oil
infrastructure released thousands of tons of very toxic hydrocarbons and
chemicals. Baghdad has seen dramatic increases of lead and particulate
matter in the air. Infant mortality and death of children under five
each doubled between 1989 and 1999, while birth defects have also
dramatically increased. Since the war, cancer rates have gone up by five
times, and cancer victims are getting younger. Dr. Huda Ammash describes
the combined effects of war and sanctions as "a health crisis of immense
proportions."9 10[. War kills people. [**Any environment with bullets
whizzing and bombs dropping is polluted in the most lethal**
**way**.]{.mark} As the technology of warfare has advanced, the
deadliness of humanity's militarism has grown by leaps and bounds. War
killed up to 175 million people, most of them civilians, in the 20th
century alone -- history's most bloody century. We must work now to

War has long contributed to ecological degradation, including the
diversion of rivers, scorched earth practices, the destruction of plants
and animals, oil spills, the burning of oil wells, and the use of
chemical and biological weapons. [The atmospheric testing of atomic and
nuclear bombs produced radioactive fallout that spread throughout the
world via wind, water, and living creatures]{.underline} (Commoner 1967,
1971). In fact, [the detonation of Trinity\--the first atomic
explosion\--in the New Mexico desert on 16 July 1945 ushered in the
nuclear era, which coincides with the age of ecology]{.underline} (Hagen
1992; Worster 1998). The environmental impacts of militarization are not
limited to war and the testing of nuclear weapons. [Military
institutions, often in the name of national security and geopolitical
circumstances, have created large-scale built and social infrastructures
to sustain and support the coercive power of nations]{.underline}.
Advances in military technologies, [[the resource demands to maintain
the social and built infrastructures of militaries]{.mark}, the testing
of machinery and weapons, and
the [transportation](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r) of
soldiers and weapons to distant places [have increased the overall
ecological and environmental impact]{.mark}s of the world\'s
militarie]{.underline}s (Clark and Jorgenson 2012). As a result of these
activities, \"[the world\'s armed forces are the **[single largest
polluter on earth]{.mark}**]{.underline}\" (Renner 1991: 132). In what
follows we direct attention to the relationships between the environment
and the world\'s national militaries. We present a general discussion of
the treadmill of destruction theory, a sociological perspective that
highlights the expansionary tendencies and environmental impacts of
militarism. We then offer a brief account of recent military
developments and expenditures, with a focus on the ascent of the
military in the [United
States](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r).
Following this discussion, we examine how the growth and structure of
militarization contributes to an array of environmental impacts. We
conclude by calling for future sociological research to seriously
consider the environmental impacts of the world\'s militaries. In this
call we suggest fruitful avenues for future research, while recognizing
some of the unique challenges faced by those who do research on the
effects of the world\'s militaries on the environment.
\"[[Militarization]{.underline}]{.mark}\" [is recognized as \"**[the
single most ecologically destructive human
endeavor]{.mark}**\"]{.underline} (Gould 2007: 331). [Yet, with few
exceptions, the environmental impacts of militarism and militarization
are mostly overlooked in environmental sociology and other environmental
social sciences. The general inattention to such relationships, given
the scale and range of influence, is problematic.]{.underline} Military
preparedness impinges\--in a highly deleterious fashion\--on the
nation\'s physical environment and, all too often, that of their
neighbors as well. [From depleting resources, eroding the physical
environment, destroying natural flora and fauna, or leaving behind a
vast array of toxins and radioactive elements, [**all aspects** of
military activity defile our environment in some
way]{.mark}.]{.underline} (Singer and Keating 1999: 326). [[Military
operations, land holdings, forces, and production facilities are often
exempt from environmental laws]{.mark}, at home and abroad, \"in the
name of national security\"]{.underline} (Gould 2007: 331; Singer and
Keating 1999: 327). Within sociology, [the treadmill of destruction
perspective examines how the expansionary dynamics and structure of
militarism produce profound environmental impacts]{.underline} (Hooks
and Smith 2004, 2005). This theoretical approach is influenced by and
related to the treadmill of production tradition within environmental
sociology, which is one of the area\'s foundational orientations. Thus,
prior to discussing the treadmill of destruction perspective, we first
provide a brief description of the treadmill of production theory. The
treadmill of production theory posits that environmental degradation
and [pollution](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r) are
an inherent part of [economic
development](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r) (Schnaiberg
1980; Schnaiberg and Gould 1994). Given that a capitalist economy is
predicated on the constant pursuit of profit and expansion, its
operations have \"direct implications for natural resource extraction,\"
the generation of pollution, and the overall state of environmental
conditions (Gould et al. 2004: 297). The economy generates ecological
problems, as it must continually withdraw resources from the environment
to produce goods and power machinery, and such activities inevitably
generate waste. [[The state]{.mark}, while often caught in contradictory
positions, is an important social institution [that supports economic
expansion through negotiating trade agreements]{.mark}, bailing out
industry and banking, [promoting military spending]{.mark}, and
protecting private property.]{.underline} According to treadmill of
production scholars, the growth imperative
of [[capitalism]{.underline}](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r) creates
an \"enduring conflict\" between human societies and the environment
(Schnaiberg and Gould 1994). Nature\--in the form of matter and
energy\--is used to fuel industry and to produce commodities for the
market. \"As societies increase their production,\" Schnaiberg (1980:
20) pointed out, \"they \'discover\' resources and \'create\' new
products.\" Each [[expansion in the production process creates a higher
level of demand for [natural
resources](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r) from [ecosystems](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r),]{.mark}
often]{.underline} [[at rates that exceed the regenerative capacity of
these systems]{.underline}]{.mark}, in order to sustain economic
operations on a larger and more intensive scale (Gould et al. 2008; see
also Foster 2005). Ecosystems are actively transformed to meet the needs
of the economic system, which contributes to ecological disorganization
(Schnaiberg 1980). Producers attempt to externalize environmental costs
as much as possible, as this has the potential to enhance profits. From
this perspective, there is a strong relationship between economic
development and [[environmental
degradation]{.underline}](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r),
and this applies to both developed nations and developing nations
(Jorgenson and Clark 2012). Hooks and Smith (2004, 2005) argue that
while the military is linked to the economy, it is not simply a
derivative of the latter. Militarism has its own distinct expansionary
dynamics and produces specific forms of environmental degradation, part
and parcel of the treadmill of destruction. Primarily for geopolitical
reasons, states declare and wage wars (Mann 1998; Tilly 1990).
Militaries are institutions that actively seek to shape and control
information to secure funding and to expand their infrastructure (Bond
2011). As nations attempt to maintain and increase power, it spurs
military development, which increases the lethality and ferocity of
conflict (Tilly 1990). At the same time, these [[military developments
increase the scale, intensity, and danger of environmental degradation
(]{.underline}]{.mark}Hooks and Smith 2004). [[Militarism produces a
treadmill of destruction that **effectively restricts [environmental
protection](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r)**.]{.underline}]{.mark}
The focus of the military in relation to the environment is made clear
by a US military base commander, who, when responding to citizen\'s
concerns about pollution, stated: \"We are in the business of protecting
the nation, not the environment\" (Renner 1991: 152; see also Clark and
Jorgenson 2012). [Geopolitical competition often drives arms races as
well as attendant technological advances, infrastructural development,
and growth in troop size.]{.underline} The environmentally damaging
capabilities of militaries, especially for developed nations, are partly
a function of technological developments with weaponry and other
machinery (Jorgenson 2005; Jorgenson and Clark 2009; Jorgenson et al.
2010). [Capital-intensive militaries employ advanced weaponry and
utilize state-of-the-art transportation systems to facilitate the rapid
movement of troops and to enhance the strike capabilities of nations,
including an extensive system of vehicles and infrastructure to aid in
the deployment of equipment and personnel (Clark et al.
2010).]{.underline} Further, capital-intensive militaries are likely to
increase their material infrastructure or become more spatially
dispersed, bringing more land under their operations (Kentor et al.
2012). The structure and organization of the military requires access to
and consumption of vast amounts of resources, such as oil, to maintain
its basic operations. The growth dynamics of militarism further expand
the treadmill of destruction, increasing the overall environmental
demands of and degradation caused by this institution (Clark and
Jorgenson 2012; Jorgenson and Clark 2009). International superpowers
have historically used part of the social surplus generated through
economic dominance to invest in military development (Hooks and
McLauchlan 1992; Kentor 2000). Domestic politics, the position of
nations within the global interstate system, and actual and perceived
threats shape the course of military development[. During the twentieth
century, technological, political, economic, and ideological changes
contributed to the ascendancy of the military into the power elite
(Mills 2000). These changes expanded the influence and scale of
militaries, deeply rooting the treadmill of destruction within national
and international politics]{.underline}. [The discussion that follows is
largely focused on the military within the United States, in part due to
the predominance of this nation\'s military within the world and the
magnitude of annual military spending of this country. However, it is
important to note that recent scholarship has extended the treadmill of
destruction perspective to the comparative-international level. Multiple
cross-national and longitudinal studies within sociology indicate that
the relative size (i.e., military participation rate) and technological
capacity (i.e., military expenditures per solider) of nations\'
militaries both contribute to growth in energy consumption (Clark et al.
2010), carbon
dioxide [emissions](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r) (Jorgenson
et al. 2010; York 2008), and overall resource consumption in the form of
the ecological footprints of nations (Jorgenson 2005; Jorgenson and
Clark 2009, 2011). These cross-national studies and their results
indicate that the environmental impacts of national militaries are far
beyond trivial, net of other human drivers of pollution and degradation,
including levels of economic
development, [population](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r) size, [urbanization](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r),
manufacturing levels, and various forms of globalization]{.underline}.
Furthermore, and in the context of generalizability, many of these
studies indicate that the environmental impacts of national militaries
are observable for samples of all countries as well as for samples
restricted to only developed countries and only [developing
countries](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r) (e.g.,
Jorgenson and Clark 2009; Jorgenson et al. 2010). Figure 1 is a scatter
plot that illustrates the relationship between carbon dioxide emissions
per capita and military expenditures per soldier (i.e., technological
capacity of national militaries), both presented in logarithmic form.
These data include observations of 72 nations from 1970 to 2000 in
five-year increments (i.e., 1970, 1975 \... 1995, 2000). Military
expenditures per soldier is calculated by dividing total military
expenditures by total military personnel. Figure 2 is a scatter plot
that illustrates the association between carbon dioxide emissions per
capita and military participation rate (i.e., relative size of national
militaries), both in logarithmic form, and for the same nations and time
points as in Figure 1. Military participation is the ratio of military
personnel per 1,000 people in the general population. These data in both
figures are the same data analyzed by Jorgenson et al. (2010). (1)
Consistent with treadmill of destruction theory, Figure 1 indicates that
the association between per capita carbon dioxide emissions and military
expenditures per solider is positive and strong in magnitude
(correlation = 0.802), while Figure 2 suggests that the relationship
between per capita emissions and military participation rate is also
positive and moderately strong (correlation = 0.486). Both world wars in
the twentieth century resulted in an unprecedented scale of destruction,
in part due to the use of new, more deadly weapons. C. Wright Mills
(2000) explains that following the Second World War the military joined
the economic and political elite in the United States. He indicates that
other historical developments and transformations in the social order
facilitated the ascent of the military into the power elite. The scale
of military operations\--including troops, equipment, and the theater of
war\--had greatly expanded. The military catalyzed scientific research
and development, especially in the production of high-tech equipment and
the development of new weapons. In fact, technological innovation became
closely linked to the weapons industry (Galbraith 1998: 257). The
expansion of the military provided economic benefits for powerful
segments within industry due to armament and other military contracts.
The destructive potential of nuclear weapons elevated military matters,
increasing the influence of the military in both the state and the
economy within the United States. The power elite increasingly adopted a
\"military definition of reality\" (Mills 2000: 198). Due to geopolitics
and the ascendancy of the military, the overall expenditures on military
and expenditures per soldier continued to increase, helping create a
permanent war economy. Figure 3 provides the total annual military
expenditures (defined as the \"total military budget\") for the United
States for the 1900 to 2007 period, while Figure 4 provides the annual
expenditures per soldier (2) for the same range of years. These data,
which are reported in 1990 international Geary-Khamis dollars (3) and
thus adjusted for inflation, were obtained from the Correlates of War
online data set (www.correlatesofwar.org/). As indicated by Figure 3,
total military expenditures increased from \$439,960 in 1900 to
\$649,800,000,000 in 2007. Turning briefly to Figure 4, military
expenditures per soldier increased from approximately \$3 in 1900 to
\$431,460 in 2007. In 1961, President Dwight Eisenhower noted that
following the Second World War the United States, and by extension the
world, had entered a new era of militarism. Prior to this period,
domestic industrial operations were redirected to support the war effort
during times of conflict. Geopolitical competition and the ascent of the
military helped create \"a permanent armaments industry of vast
proportions\" and an expansive military structure that included millions
of enlisted soldiers. While Eisenhower is known for warning against the
\"unwarranted influence\" of the military-industrial complex\--a concept
that had been introduced in the late 1940s (Riefler 1947)\--he also
upheld the imperative need for its development (Eisenhower 1961). The
ascent of the military increased the interaction and traffic between the
corporate and military realms. Mills (2000: 213) indicates that
following the Second World War, \"\[m\]ilitary demands continued to
shape and to pace the corporate economy,\" especially given major
military contracts. What is more, \"military production helped prop up
the entire economic edifice in the United States, and was a factor
holding off economic stagnation\" (Foster 2006: 110). In reflecting on
the interconnections between the power elite, the expanding military
budget, and the growth imperative of the larger system, Charles H.
Anderson (1976: 76-77) explained, \"Military spending is ideally suited
to the growth system since it pumps money into private production,
redistributes income upward, and always finds an outlet, that is, there
is never enough military power or sophisticated enough military
hardware.\" The expansion in military spending wedded \"big science\" to
the military in the United States (and elsewhere), as research and
development were geared to addressing the specialized technological
needs for advanced military performance (Hooks and McLauchlan 1992). The
military directed social resources to designing, developing, testing,
and deploying superior vehicles, planes, boats, and weapons for national
security and potential use in future conflicts. The new equipment was
made of special materials, corresponding to advances in weapons. These
technological developments have made the military more capital- and
material-intensive (Shaw 1988). Technological advances allow the
military to move massive amounts of equipment and soldiers throughout
the world more easily, covering more land in less time (Collins 1981).
These advances have increased the expense of military operations,
especially the costs associated with operating special equipment such as
aircraft carriers, planes, helicopters, and tanks. Such trends encourage
the international arms race between the global powers, as novel
technologies and weapons set a new standard for warfare (Clark and
Jorgenson 2012). While the military (i.e., the treadmill of destruction)
is connected to the economy (i.e., the treadmill of production) in
complex ways, given the military-industrial complex, it also generates
its own growth dynamics that require immense amounts of capital,
supplies of energy, and other raw materials to sustain its operations
(Clark et al. 2010; Jorgenson and Clark 2009). Figure 5 provides primary
energy consumption (coal, petroleum, electricity, and natural gas) for
the United States, measured in thousands of coal-ton equivalents, for
every twenty years (i.e., 1900, 1920 \... 1980, 2000) from 1900 to 2000,
as well as for the year 2007. These data were also obtained from the
Correlates of War online data set. The consumption of such energy
sources leads to increases in greenhouse gas emissions and thus
contributes to climate change (IPCC 2007). As indicated by Figure 5,
primary energy consumption in the United States increased from 256,081
thousands of coal-ton equivalents in 1900 to 5,548,023 thousands of
coal-ton equivalents in 2007, and the general pattern of the increase is
quite similar to the upward trajectories for both military expenditures
measures in Figures 3 and 4. [[Militarism contributes to environmental
degradation during times of war and peace.]{.mark} The environmental and
public health harms associated with war are more obvious, so we provide
only a few examples to illustrate the range of impacts. Biological and
chemical weapons contaminate ecosystems and devastate landscapes. Agent
Orange was used to defoliate
the [landscape](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r) during
the Vietnam War, polluting the land and water and causing significant
health problems for citizens of Vietnam and US soldiers. More recently,
depleted uranium has been used in the manufacturing of bullets, shells,
and bombs. This material contributes to the contamination of the land
during and following war and presents serious health risks for human and
animal populations (Birchard 1998; Sanders 2009; White 2008). Waging war
also produces a broad range of debris that accumulates as pollution
within the nations where war is being waged, as well as at the military
bases used in the military campaign. Debris, in this particular case,
includes fuel deposits, ammunition dumps, drums filled with oil and
solvents, asphalt, grease, paint, tires, cables, unexploded munitions,
gunpowder, and fiberboard. These materials introduce an array of
chemicals and other toxins into ecosystems that will continue to harm
both flora and fauna unless a \"clean operation\" is conducted
(Lanier-Graham 1993). Military campaigns consume enormous amounts of
fossil (and nuclear) fuels in planes, ships, and tanks (Grimes 1999;
Klare 2002; Lanier-Graham 1993; Marshall 2005; Pellow 2007; Thomas
1995). Michael Klare (2007) indicates that [the]{.mark} [US military
consumes at least 1.3 billion gallons of oil annually in the Middle East
alon]{.mark}e\--more than the annual consumption of Bangladesh. Such
levels of fossil fuel use contribute to the global accumulation of
carbon dioxide emissions and thus cause climate change (IPCC 2007). War
also contributes
to [deforestation](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r) and
the loss of wildlife habitat, as people attempt to rebuild what was lost
during the conflict (Lanier-Graham 1993).]{.underline} Too often the
environmental impacts of militarism are overlooked. This situation is
especially true in terms of the expansionary dynamics and environmental
impacts of militarism during periods of peace (Clark and Jorgenson
2012). The constant preparation for future conflicts by vested military
interests and persistent geopolitical concerns escalate the scale and
operations of militaries. As a result, the treadmill of destruction
expands even in the absence of armed conflict. Military institutions and
their activities consume vast amounts of nonrenewable energy and other
resources for research and development, maintenance, and operation of
the overall infrastructure (Dycus 1996; Jorgenson 2005; Jorgenson et al.
2010; Sidel and Shahi 1997; York 2008). At the same time, military
operations generate large amounts of toxic substances and waste, which
contribute to the contamination of land and water. The testing of
nuclear weapons released strontium-90, iodine-131, and other radioactive
isotopes directly into the environment, leading to the bioaccumulation
of these materials throughout the food web (Commoner 1967; Hastings
2000; LaDuke 1999; Shulman 1992; Ward 1999). Other hazardous toxins are
introduced into the environment through the production, storage,
transportation, and disposal of biological and chemical weapons
(Lanier-Graham 1993). In the 1940s, the Hanford Project was built in the
state of Washington in the United States to manufacture nuclear weapons.
Nuclear reactors were used to produce plutonium. When this plant was
decommissioned, there remained millions of gallons and cubic feet of
radioactive waste. The groundwater in the area is contaminated. This
site, located along the Columbia River, is generally deemed to be one of
the most polluted sites in the world (McNeill 2000). Likewise, Rocky
Mountain Arsenal, also within the United States, which manufactured
chemical weapons, remains a Superfund site, as the \"by-products from
the production of mustard gas, napalm, incendiary weapons, and other
types of munitions were dumped on the land for decades\" (Lanier-Graham
1993: 80). Pesticides, solvents, mercury, lead, and arsenic also
contaminate this land. These toxins are known to pollute groundwater.
Military bases throughout the world have been identified as sites of
toxic contamination, and in the 1960s and 1970s, millions of gallons of
radioactive waste were dumped by the US Navy into Pearl Harbor (LaDuke
1999: 173). Singer and Keating (1999: 330-331) detail how military
preparedness includes use of \"rare and poisonous metals such as
titanium, beryllium, germanium, cobalt, thallium, and depleted
uranium,\" which \"are extremely toxic to extract and refine.\" These
materials, as well as other potentially dangerous chemicals, are often
exclusively employed in the production of military goods. Part of the
everyday operation and maintenance of military equipment includes the
use of a broad range of thinners, solvents, lubricants, degreasers,
fuels, pesticides, and propellants. As a result, \"the Department of
Defense . generates 500,000 tons of toxic waste annually, more than the
top five US chemical companies combined, and it is estimated that the
armed forces of the major world powers produce the greatest amount of
hazardous waste in the world\" (Singer and Keating 1999: 338). Thus,
\"the most ecologically devastated locations on Earth\" are found
wherever \"military production facilities\" operate (Gould 2007: 331).
Armed forces have used a steadily increasing amount of land for bases,
other installations, and training exercises over the last century
([[United
Nations]{.underline}](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r) Center
for Disarmament 1982). The end of the Cold War did not reduce the use of
public lands for military operations, training, testing, and exercises
(Singer and Keating 1999). In 2003, the United States alone had over 900
military bases located domestically and operated over 700 military bases
in 130 countries (Johnson 2004). By 2007, there were over 800 US
military bases overseas (Sanders 2009). A network of military bases
encompasses the globe, requiring a vast amount of [[fossil
fuels]{.underline}](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r) and
other resources to staff, operate, and transport equipment and personnel
between destinations. Even with advanced technologies, military
operations require bases close to theaters of action to supply energy
and personnel needs (Collins 1981). To a significant extent military
power remains dependent upon access to land (Foster 2006; Jorgenson and
Clark 2009). [Militaries must have ready supplies of raw materials and
energy as well as the infrastructure to support their operations and to
meet the needs of their personnel. Consequently, military-oriented
resource use involves strategic stockpiling of munitions, spare parts,
fossil fuels, and other ancillary equipment to sustain its operations.
The resource consumption of the military is further increased
by [industries](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r) that
produce marginal equipment for the armed forces and their support
economies (Jorgenson 2005). The production of such marginal equipment
and stockpiling of fuels places greater demands upon the
environment.]{.underline} The populations of armed forces also use large
quantities of materials for uniforms and specialized forms of clothing
that would not otherwise be consumed. Furthermore, the labor intensity
of militaries increases the resources required for training, armaments,
transportation, and
the [[housing]{.underline}](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA313972354&v=2.1&it=r) of
troops and support personnel (Jorgenson and Clark 2009; Jorgenson et al.
2010). During regular operations, including peacetime activities, the
armed forces consume large amounts of fossil fuels, adding to the
accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (Jorgenson et al. 2010;
Roberts et al. 2003). Vaclav Smil (2000) points out that the three
branches of the US military consumed approximately 25 million tons of
fuel per year in the 1990s, excluding energy consumed in both the Gulf
War and the bombing of Kosovo. He indicates that this amount was \"more
than the total commercial energy consumption of nearly two thirds of the
world\'s countries\" (Smil 2000: 38). The high consumption of fossil
fuels is, in part, a reflection of the high-tech equipment employed by
the armed forces. Additionally, soldiers must be constantly trained to
use this equipment, and the high-tech machinery and vehicles must be
tested. Planes, helicopters, ships, tanks, and armed vehicles all
require enormous amounts of oil to make them move\--not to mention the
various ancillary infrastructures that are required for their operation,
such as air strips, roads, and supply vehicles. For example, one hour of
operation of a nonnuclear aircraft carrier consumes 21,300 liters (over
5,621 gallons) of fuel; large, high-tech military helicopters burn 5
gallons of fuel for every mile that they travel; and fighter planes,
such as the F-15 and F-16, consume between 1,500 and 1,700 gallons of
fuel per hour. If their afterburners are used, up to 14,400 gallons are
exhausted per hour (Cutler 1989; Renner 1997: 120; Sanders 2009; Smith
2003). Renner (1997: 120) states that \"a modern battle tank\'s fuel
consumption is so voracious that it is better measured in gallons per
mile than in miles per gallon.\" Of the top ten fuel guzzlers, eight of
them are support vehicles that carry fuel and supplies. Only two are
combat vehicles\--the Apache helicopter and the M-1 Abrams tank (Karbuz
2007). As the military pursues \"bigger, faster, and more sophisticated
weapons, fuel efficiency continues to plummet\" (Smith 2003). Superior
combat performance of equipment is a greater priority than energy
efficiency for military institutions. In the 1980s, \"nearly a quarter
of all jet fuel\" was consumed by militaries throughout the world; and
approximately three-quarters of the petroleum used by the armed forces
fuels vehicles, aircrafts, sea vessels, and other forms of warfare
machinery (Renner 1991, 1997: 120). [The Pentagon has the largest fleet
of high-tech military equipment, which is fueled almost entirely by oil.
According to Klare (2007), it is perhaps the \"leading consumer of
petroleum\" in the world]{.underline}. Figure 6 provides the results of
Jorgenson et al.\'s (2010) cross-national longitudinal study of per
capita carbon dioxide emissions (emissions resulting primarily from
fossil fuel consumption) for 72 nations from 1970 to 2000. The reported
coefficients, which are all statistically significant, are estimated
from fixed effects regression analysis and standardized, allowing for
comparisons of the relative magnitude of the effects of the explanatory
variables. Of particular relevance, the effects of both military
variables are positive and larger in magnitude than the effect of
manufacturing as percent of total gross domestic product (GDP). These
results also hold in analyses restricted to just developing nations as
well as for analyses of total carbon emissions. Besides directly
contributing to carbon emissions through the consumption of fossil
fuels, [[militarization appears to influence the willingness and timing
of nations to ratify environmental treaties]{.underline}]{.mark}. In a
recent cross-national study, Givens (2012) employs event history
analysis techniques and finds that higher levels of militarization, in
the context of both military expenditures and military participation
rates, are associated with longer periods of time until ratification
and/or failure to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Along these lines,
Christoff (2008) explores how the United States\' position as a global
\"superpower,\" with unrivaled military and economic power, did not
exempt it from censure when it refused to agree to the proposed text at
the Bali climate conference. He also explores how [[the economic and
military positions of the United States]{.underline}]{.mark} and China
in the global system [[influence their actions on climate negotiations
and notes the importance of the United States\' internal budgetary
issues and external attempts to retain military supremacy in shaping
climate discussions]{.underline}]{.mark} (Christoff 2010). In
conclusion, we forcefully assert that the environmental impacts of the
nation\'s militaries must be seriously considered in future research on
the anthropogenic drivers of environmental harms. Doing so will not be
easy, but this broader perspective is imperative given that global
climate change and unsustainable resource consumption are among the most
serious challenges currently facing the world.

## 2AC -- Militarization Good

#### Militarization is key to Russia deterrence 

**Sherr 17** (Sherr, James. "Policy Implications." *The Militarization
of Russian Policy*, German Marshall Fund of the United States, 2017, pp.
15--17. *JSTOR*, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep19014.9. Accessed 20

// OA

Since February 2014, [NATO Allies have become increasingly aware of
Russia's determination to disrupt the cohesion of the West]{.underline}
as we have come to define it. However, doubts persist about the degree
of strategic thinking that motivates its policy. The picture we have
presented not only outlines a strategic framework. It delineates, even
by [Russian]{.underline} standards, an unusual degree of integration
between the political objectives of the state and the expansion of its
military power. That expansion is not a Brownian motion. It is a
[coherent and purpose-driven activity designed to challenge Western
dominance of an international order]{.underline} that Russia's state
leadership perceives as harmful to its interests and intrinsically
vulnerable. For understandable reasons, many in the West are also
addressing the critical question of how our own policy tools might be
used to change Russian mindsets and perceptions. But the underlying
challenge, much as Putin has aggravated it, is not Russian perceptions,
but its interests. And, where European security is concerned, Moscow's
interests can be expected to diverge from ours in significant respects
even if Putin is replaced by a successor with different priorities. The
more immediate challenge is to change Western mindsets rather than
Russian ones. [Our homo economicus, business school metrics do not
explain very much about Putin's Russia]{.underline}. State mobilization
might impose serious diseconomies on an already overburdened resource
base. But as long as it continues, it continues and produces
consequences that NATO needs to confront and counter. Those who believe
that compromise, vigorous dialogue, or neorealist grand bargains will
resolve our differences have been neither watching nor listening.
Dialogue will never be more effective than the policy underpinning it.
Angela Merkel's exhaustive discussions with Vladimir Putin have provided
useful reinforcement to a moderately tough policy. John Kerry's
indefatigable dialogue with Sergey Lavrov over Syria only amplified
weakness. The Kremlin is willing to match us in talking as well as
fighting. Its curt and pre-emptive rejection of a grand bargain with the
United States at the start of the Trump administration is telling in
itself. [Russia expects material changes to the structure of
international relations and is determined to press its perceived
advantages until concessions are forced upon us.]{.underline} The only
way to diminish the threats Russia poses is to diminish these
advantages. Once that imperative is accepted, we will find that the news
is not all that bad. Time does not favor Russia. True enough, Russia has
defied repeated Western forecasts about the unsustainability of its
economic model. Low oil prices and Western sanctions have brought its
proverbial coping mechanisms and organizational ingenuity to the fore.
Nevertheless, Russia's economy is in decline, its technological base is
stagnant, and the mobilization reflex merely postpones the day when its
structural problems are either addressed or wreak vengeance. Thus, the
West has good grounds for strategic patience. However, time is not a
strategic actor. It has to be used. For strategic patience to bear
fruit, there must be a strategy as well as patience. [Deterrence is only
a strategy if it addresses the threat to be deterred]{.underline}. As
serious students of Russian strategy have noted, war with Russia means
war with all of Russia. [Yet the war Russia is preparing to fight has
limited objectives: to shatter the cohesion of NATO, destroy its forces
in the operational theater, and force it to concede defeat at the
earliest possible moment. Without confidence in these outcomes, Russia
will not go to war. The aim of NATO's deterrence must be to convince
Russia that any war against NATO means war with all of NATO, wherever
its forces are based.]{.underline} **[To this end, the priority for
Western military establishments is not to outmatch the Russians where
they are naturally strong, but to invest in the antidotes to these
strengths]{.underline}**. The Alliance confronted a similar challenge at
the height of the Brezhnev era. Its "dual track" decision of 1979 forced
the Soviets to contend with mobile, high-readiness, theaterbased nuclear
systems that could have been used to devastating effect at the outset of
conflict. Coupled with the exploitation of then revolutionary "smart"
non-nuclear U.S. Army weapons and war-fighting concepts (AirLand
Battle), the West effectively threatened to annul ten years of Soviet
investment in a "strategic offensive operation" against NATO. NATO
undertook this task in the teeth of unprecedented internal opposition to
its policy (focused on the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament) and an
intense Soviet active measures campaign in Europe. The [result of the
new NATO policy was not an apocalyptic confrontation, but a change of
course for the USSR and a process of mutual de-escalation of military
threats and political tensions in Europe.]{.underline} [Today's
conditions are in one respect more promising]{.underline} than those
that confronted NATO 35 to 40 years ago. Gerasimov's anxiety, "the
destruction of military forces and key state assets in several hours,"
derives from "prompt global strike" and shorter range non-nuclear
systems against which Russia might only be able to threaten nuclear
retaliation. Strategically, they have the potential to threaten assets
critical to war-waging and state management without producing nuclear
devastation. Operationally, they might cut several of Russia's pathways
to escalation dominance that presently exist[. From a Russian
perspective, this new generation of weapons is destabilizing**; from a
Western perspective, the opposite**]{.underline}. Investment in these
systems will not absolve NATO of the need to maintain a coherent nuclear
posture. But when combined with other means of enhancing the West's
robustness and resilience, it will constrain Russia's ability to fight
war on its terms. If it cannot do so, it is most unlikely to fight at
all. The observation of Finland's leading expert on Russian military
policy is worth citing: In the Georgian and Ukrainian crises and Syrian
air operations, Russia has demonstrated its high readiness for limited
military operations to secure and promote its national interests in
situations when, according to its estimation, success is easily gained
and risk of unfavourable escalation is low.36 In these respects,
Vladimir Putin is a good steward of Russian tradition. Only two
conditions have provoked Russia during his tenure: weaknesses (Ukraine
in conditions of state collapse and Syria after a geopolitical vacuum
had been created by the United States) and bluff (NATO's ill-judged 2008
promise that Georgia and Ukraine "will become members of NATO"). No
example can be found of Russia attacking a stronger opponent that
understood its own strength. **[A strong opponent afraid of its own
strength is only asking for trouble]{.underline}**. [The simple and most
basic object of deterrence is to persuade would-be opponents that force
is not the solution to their problems. **But it is not simple to
achieve**]{.underline}. In 1987 the Soviet Union concluded that  "the
application of military means to resolve any dispute is inadmissible
under current conditions."37 It is not beyond our means to bring Russia
to the same conclusion

## 2ac -- Small States

#### NATO and the US have a vested interest in protecting and incorporating smaller states

James **Jay**, 8-10-20**18**, \"Why Small States Matter to Big Powers,\"
National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/why-small-states-matter-big-powers-28362//CDMoney

[Nobody is bigger than the United States of America]{.underline}. **[No
big power more appreciates small powers]{.underline}**. [No small state
will find a better friend than the United States.]{.underline} In an era
of great power competition, "[small" matters a good deal.]{.underline}
Little nations are not sand to be ground between the great wheels of
major powers. **[They are made up of people, not pawns.]{.underline}**
[Citizens in small states have the same hopes, aspirations and natural
rights as those in world powers. These people have every reason to
expect and demand a life of freedom, peace and prosperity.]{.underline}
Further, it [is in the interests of bigger states to help small states
flourish]{.underline}. Great powers, if wise, will [support the best
hopes of smaller states.]{.underline} There are three reasons why the
United States, in particular, ought to take small states seriously.
Sonovia **[1. Geography Matters]{.underline}**. In geopolitics---as in
real estate---a critical consideration is "location, location,
location." To a major power, a country's greatest asset might be its map
coordinates rather than the size of its arsenal or bank account.
Geography matters when it comes to economic integration, transportation,
energy distribution and physical security. Even in a digitized world,
the freedom to move people, goods, and services across physical space is
a valuable commodity. Recognizing the importance of connecting dots on
the ground is not an argument for hardened spheres of control (such as
during the Cold War) or carving up the world (like seventeenth-century
mercantilists). On the other hand, there is a [case to be made for
building bridges between like-minded nations that want to live together
with surety in commerce and share peaceful borders. Thus, a small state
in the right place can be very important to a big power. **Iceland** is
a case in point. Even though it has no armed forces, the island's
location makes the nation a **lynchpin in transatlantic security.**
That's the **reason Iceland** was included as one of twelve **founding
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.**]{.underline}
Without question, Iceland's strategic location is of far greater
importance to U.S. security than the state's size and resources would
suggest. Washington should be working hard to make that bilateral
relationship even stronger. [Part of the reason **NATO** continues to
**keep** the **membership door open** is **because** there are **nations
still not included whose accession would enhance collective security**
due to their location.]{.underline} These include Macedonia, Georgia,
Ukraine and Kosovo. And there are states in other regions where stronger
bilateral relations would greatly serve U.S. interests. Closer ties with
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, for example, would further U.S. efforts to
sustain a free and open Indo-Pacific. In the Middle East, [few states
are smaller than Jordan. Yet, a **peaceful, prosperous Jordan** is a
**keystone for regional stability**, and **regional stability is a vital
interest of the United States**]{.underline}---as important to this
administration as it should have been to the last one. Similarly,
Tunisia is an important state for extending an umbrella of regional
stability in the greater Middle East to North Africa. 2. Freedom
Matters. Like-minded nations make better partners. [One of the reasons
NATO works is because the alliance is a partnership of free
nation-states.]{.underline} The [foundational rationale of the
transatlantic alliance is that free states have the right to associate
for the purpose of collective security. **To close NATO's open door
would undermine what NATO stands for: the right of free peoples to
choose their future.**]{.underline}

#### **If not already, aff increases coordination and quality of life for smaller states**

National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/why-small-states-matter-big-powers-28362//CDMoney

Building Bridges to Small Nations The [United States has an inherent
advantage over adversarial powers in partnering with small nations.
**China and Russia don't have allies**]{.underline}. They have
underlings. [No country wants to be a suburb of Beijing or Moscow.
**America, however, has to up its game.**]{.underline} Here is a
ten-step process to get the job done. Step 1. Set the Right Objectives
for Friends. In [reducing vulnerabilities of friends, allies and
strategic partners to adversarial influences]{.underline}, American
[objectives should be framed less in driving particular political
outcomes or agendas]{.underline} (e.g., promoting marriage equality)
[than in achieving good stable governance, strong institutions and a
reduction in corruption.]{.underline} This will make our partners more
resilient and self-confident. Step 2. Avoid Us-or-Them-ism. The goal of
a small-state strategy is not to exclude adversarial competitors. For
example, America can't ask countries not to do business with China.
After all, the United States does business with China. The goal is not
to get countries to takes sides but to engage and help them act
consistent with their own interests---eschewing, for instance, economic
engagement detrimental to national security or that undermines the rule
of law and good governance. Step 2. Promote Economic Freedom. China and
Russia can buy influence because, in poor nations with weak governance,
a little money goes a long far. The [best way to make these states more
resistant to malicious influence is to help them become wealthier and
better governed. This is best accomplished by promoting economic
freedom.]{.underline} Step 3. Enter Free Trade Agreements (FTA). Trade
agreements fundamentally have to be about liberalizing trade and making
markets freer. That said, **[prioritizing agreements with states where
the United States is seeking friendship, and common cause makes
sense]{.underline}**. America, for example, ought to have an FTA with
Tunisia. Step 4. Be There. In many small, like-minded nations, [all the
United States has to do to win friends is, simply, to be there. Too much
American engagement rests on foreign assistance and not enough on
building human-to-human relationships and a more robust presence by the
U.S. private sector.]{.underline}

 Strikingly, and little commented on by liberal or leftist outlets, some
of the most vocal proponents of the 'militarization' thesis (at least
within the context of the United States) have been from the Libertarian
Right. An article published by the Foundation for Economic Education
(FEE) portrays the disturbing arrival of a 'new breed of cop' with a
'military mentality' ([Greenhunt
2008](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)),
while an essay in the journal of the Independent Institute claims that a
long standing separation between the domestic police and military
functions of the US government has been irrevocably breached ([Hall and
Coyne
2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
501). By far the most influential advocate of the militarization
doctrine is Radley Balko, a former writer and analyst for libertarian
institutions Reason Magazine and the Cato Institute, the latter of which
has intimate ties with the powerful Koch Brothers, who have also
increasingly become concerned with police reform. Balko, currently of
the Huffington Post, is a prolific and outspoken journalist, who has
written countless media articles and policy reports and two books on the
subject: Overkill: The Rise of Paramilitary Police Raids in
America ([Balko
2006](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569))
and the more recent Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of
America's Police Forces ([Balko
2013a](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)). [Balko
(2006)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569) maintains
that domestic law enforcement has become dangerously invasive:
'Americans have long maintained that a man's home is his castle and that
he has the right to defend it from unlawful intruders. Unfortunately,
that right may be disappearing' (p. iv). His main contention is that
such tactics have encouraged a dangerous blurring between the police and
military, in which the police work of protecting public safety is
confused with the military work of seeking and destroying enemies
([Balko
2006](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
15). Despite Balko's work focusing primarily on the United States, it
has transcended its North American trappings, with his work referenced
in a report prepared by the South African government, which called for
the 'demilitarization' of the national police force ([National
Development Plan
2012](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
392). Although his work is often cited in progressive or radical
publications[, Balko's politics are squarely on the right: getting his
start with Fox News, and then working long stints for Republican Party
aligned think tanks, calling for the privatization of social welfare and
prisons and, of course, defending the public influence of the Koch
Brothers ([Ames & Levine
2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).]{.underline}

It is important to note that according to the Law Enforcement Support

tactical vehicles. Some of the weapons and tactical vehicles that can be
acquired include: MRAPs (Mine Resistant Vehicles), other armored
vehicles, night vision (sights, binoculars, goggles and lights),
aircraft (planes and helicopters), machine guns (5.56mm and 7.62mm
rifles) and or magazines with no ammunition. The vast majority of
property acquired through the program includes clothing, office
supplies, tools, and rescue equipment and is thus not militarized (LESO,

In what way should one expect NATO to enhance democratic development?
After all, as highlighted above, [[democracy is a **core principle** of
the institution]{.mark}.]{.underline} Much of the existing work on NATO
and democratic development points to several avenues of possible
influence: socialization, [guidance from NATO about how to create and
implement reforms, NATO pressure to implement reforms, and legitimizing
new democracies by helping them provide the public good of security
through NATO membership. It is important to note that each of these
mechanisms for how [NATO could prompt reform]{.mark}]{.underline} should
begin operating before full NATO membership is achieved[.]{.underline}
Once prospective members are given a promise of membership in the form
of the MAP, they will be brought into close contact with NATO members
and therefore exposed to the socialization mechanism. If domestic reform
is a necessary condition for NATO membership, prospective members
participating in the MAP should begin reforming so that they can reap
the benefits of membership. Finally, if democratic reforms made to gain
NATO membership persist, NATO membership should also be associated with
higher levels of democracy in new member states. [Below we discuss each
of these means for NATO influence proposed in the
literature.]{.underline}

[First, [NATO]{.mark} may [have a]{.mark}]{.underline} subtle [[impact
on]{.mark}]{.underline} future [[member states by socializing military
and civilian leaders]{.mark} from states seeking membership [to respect
**democratic norms**]{.mark}**.** Democracy is dependent not only on the
formal institutions of a country, but also on whether elites are willing
to abide by democratic constraints on their power rather than undermine
or dismantle them.]{.underline} The example of Poland's recent
democratic backsliding despite the former presence of formal democratic
institutions illustrates this point[. Even when democratic reforms
preceded NATO involvement, [NATO]{.mark} could still have a
democratizing influence by [socializing military and civilian elites to
respect democratic reforms---particularly civilian control of the
military]{.mark}. NATO created the conditions for regular,
institutionalized interaction between elites from partner states and
longtime member states within the institutional framework of the
alliance and the Partnership for Peace (PfP), making socialization
possible. NATO taught military officers and civilian defense
policymakers who had served most of their professional lives under a
communist system about the norms of a democracy and their role in it
(Gheciu [2005b](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR24)).
This socialization logic outlined by Alexandra Gheciu and others is not
in conflict with our argument, as we measure changes in democratic
institutions rather than changes in elite attitudes.]{.underline}
However, recent democratic backsliding in some NATO countries indicates
that either the right elites were not socialized by NATO or the main
effect of NATO socialization was teaching elites to value civilian
control of the military and continued engagement with NATO.

Elite socialization began well before NATO membership, with collective
briefings, individualized MAPs for each prospective member state,
NATO-led workshops, military advisers from NATO member states, and
professional education programs
(Gheciu [2005b](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR24)).
NATO used these cooperative activities to teach the goals and norms of
the alliance and assess the commitment of PfP countries to them
(Gheciu [2005a](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR23)).
Joint military exercises, in addition to augmenting the capability
aggregation of the alliance, allowed military elites from NATO states
and prospective member states to interact. Military education
programs---such as the NATO Defence College and programs through partner
states such as the year-long International Fellows program at the US
National Defense University---played a similar role in building military
capability while creating space for socialization through
military-to-military interactions.

[Second, even [when countries intended to make democratic
reforms]{.mark} on their own initiative, [they]{.mark} often [lacked
institutional knowledge about how to reform]{.mark}. [NATO stepped in to
provide **assistance**]{.mark} and advice to prospective members
regarding how to enact democratic reforms. Democracy advising was
provided through the NATO Parliamentary Assembly and the associated
Rose-Roth seminars. According to Trine Flockhart
([2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR18)),
the NATO Parliamentary Assembly and Rose-Roth seminars brought together
parliamentarians from NATO and partner states to 'familiarize
legislators with key security issues and debates, to promote the
development of appropriate civil--military relations, and to facilitate
the sharing of expertise and experience in parliamentary practice and
procedures.' These seminars also played a 'very important social
function' as policymakers from NATO and partner countries built
professional networks with one another
(Flockhart [2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR18)).
Civilian defense policymakers and military officers from NATO partner
countries were also able to participate in the NATO-adjacent George C.
Marshall Center, which has over 13,300 alumni. Courses at the Marshall
Center include discussion of international law, democracy, rule of law,
and human rights alongside more traditional security topics (Marshall
Center [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR22)).]{.underline}

[Third, [NATO provided pressure for specific
reforms]{.mark}]{.underline} through direct communication with a
country's NATO liaisons and naming and shaming countries slacking on
reforms. For example, a US Congressional Research Service report
released in 1995 raised concerns that Poland was not ready for NATO
membership. The report stated: 'Initiation into NATO nevertheless may
hinge even more on publication of a democratic Constitution and the
legal basis for civilian control. Meanwhile, the Minister of Defense and
many senior officers who set policy and shape opinions have become mired
in political wrangling over control of the armed forces' (quoted in
Epstein [2005](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR15),
254--285). As Rachel Epstein notes, this report was widely publicized in
the Polish media with the effect of shaming Polish officials into
complying, given that NATO membership was by this time an established
national foreign policy goal. When the chief of the Polish General
Staff, General Tadeusz Wilecki, opposed increased civilian control of
the military, an unflattering New York Times article put sufficient
pressure on Polish president Aleksander Kwasniewski that he removed
Wilecki
(Epstein [2006](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR16),
280--281).

By utilizing naming and shaming tactics and building alliances with
pro-reform domestic politicians, NATO successfully shepherded a select
group of partner states through enacting civilian control of the
military and more internationalized defense policies
(Epstein [2005](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR15)).
Although Poland joined NATO in the 1999 wave of enlargement, one could
argue that the logic of pressure for reforms was still relevant for the
countries that joined NATO in 2004. The smaller reforms of hiring
personnel supportive of democratic norms and building political
coalitions in support of democracy that Epstein highlights are
consistent with what we find in our quantitative analysis. Some states
that rapidly enacted democratic reforms after transition to democracy in
the early 1990s made small improvements under NATO tutelage, even though
their average democracy scores after reaching NATO applicant status and
membership remained similar to what they had been before. Other
NATO-induced changes, such as the firing of Wilecki in Poland, may have
been crucial for continued progress even though our quantitative data do
not measure them. NATO's value, then, may be in encouraging states
already democratizing to persist in maintaining democracy despite
challenges from domestic elites. However, any democratizing effect of
NATO would be concentrated on the premembership period, as democracy is
in practice not a condition for remaining a NATO member.

[[Finally, NATO can assist in providing the public good of
security]{.mark}, [which can be **critical for the legitimacy of some
new democracies**]{.mark}. Poast and Urpelainen
([2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR49))
argue that [leaders in transitional democracies use]{.mark}, and often
must create, i[nternational organizations to consolidate democratic rule
and improve their ability to distribute public goods to the
populations]{.mark} under their rule. Public goods are broadly defined
as policies that benefit large constituencies in society. Examples of
public goods include internal and external security (Loader and
Walker [2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR40);
Bueno de Mesquita et
al. [1999](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR6)),
public infrastructure that increases investment
(Henisz [2002](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR29)),
free and fair elections
(Donno [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR14)),
reduction of corruption
(Banerjee [1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR2)),
and environmental protection (VanDeveer and
Dabelko [2001](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR55)).
Providing such goods is critical to the survival of leaders in
democratizing states.]{.underline} But because autocratic developing
countries have little need or capacity to improve the provision of
public goods (Bueno de Mesquita et
al. [2003](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR7);
Wintrobe [1998](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR59)),
democratization leaves leaders in newly democratic regimes with a unique
challenge; they face high expectations for public good provision, yet
their administrative apparatus has little experience providing public
goods (Haggard and
Kaufman [1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR28)).
[Therefore, [newly democratic governments can benefit from outside
expertise on public goods provision]{.mark}, namely that offered by
international organizations (IOs). IOs can assist democratizing states
in the provision of public goods. IOs provide a venue through which
members can pool limited resources or coordinate on policy reforms even
with limited institutional capacity. IOs assist in highly technical
tasks, including advising on governance capacity, monitoring elections,
and facilitating learning about democratic institutions. IOs can help
governments of transitional democracies govern effectively and acquire
the resources to supply public goods to the newly expanded
electorate.]{.underline}

[[The credibility of the Baltic states' democratic institutions]{.mark}
and democratic process were tied to providing the public good of
security through establishing and maintaining effective sovereignty.
This meant that preventing interference from Russia was critical to the
survival of Baltic democracy. Historically, the Baltics were classic
buffer states that had been repeatedly occupied and/or annexed by the
major European powers over the centuries
(Fazal [2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR17);
Snyder [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR53)).
But the governments of the Baltic states could not provide security from
their own resources. Indeed, the security forces of these states were
nonexistent. Kasekamp and Veebel
([2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR34),
13) point out that 'unlike the Warsaw Pact countries, the Baltic states
had no military establishment or diplomatic service of their own during
the Cold War. These [had to be built]{.mark} from scratch in the 1990s.'
Zalkans
([1999](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR60),
2), the former Latvian national security adviser, remarked in 1999 that,
upon gaining independence, the Latvian military had no military threat
analysis, defense concept, defense plan, or knowledge of budgetary
processes or force planning. Former Lithuanian defense minister Linas
Linkevičius labeled the status of the Lithuanian military 'a mess,'
while Danish defense minister Hans Haekkerup observed that the Baltic
states' officers would need substantial retraining, as their only
professional soldiers had been Soviet trained
(Ito [2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR31),
241--242). Furthermore, a 1993 report [by]{.mark} the International
Institute for Strategic Studies noted that progress in establishing
forces would be slow because of a lack of financial resources and
necessary expertise, a general reluctance to volunteer for service, and
the various exemptions from conscript service
(Rudzīte-Stejskala [2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR51),
171**). [NATO]{.mark}** Commander of Allied forces in Northern Europe
Sir Garry Johnson remarked that the Baltic states 'started from zero'
(quoted in
Ito [2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR31),
242).]{.underline}

[Security, in the view of the [Baltic states, could only be acquired
by]{.mark} foreign help, and this left just one option: the **[Western
democracies]{.mark}**. In fact, the Baltic states never considered
alternatives to seeking membership in Western institutions, **[namely
NATO]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [For example, Raivo Vare, the Estonian
state minister, asserted: 'The only real possibility is NATO' (quoted in
Lepik [2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR38),
164). NATO's PfP initiative was a useful first step in fulfilling the
needs of the Baltic states. PfP, approved by the existing NATO members
at the autumn 1993 NATO summit, allowed NATO to engage in peacekeeping
operations with Central and Eastern European countries. By the mid-1990s
the USA, sensing the need to craft a policy regarding the Baltic states,
devised the Baltic Action Plan (BAP), a three-track process for
integrating the Baltic states into the West: expand US-Baltic
cooperation, expand US-Nordic cooperation to assist the Baltics, and
expand US involvement in mediating Baltic-Russian differences. This was
followed by the creation of the MAP. When the first Eastern European
states (the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland) officially entered NATO
in 1999, the other NATO hopefuls embarked on the MAP. The MAP was a
series of workshops in which NATO staff offered advice, assistance, and
support for countries wishing to join NATO, and only a subgroup of PfP
members were invited to take part in the MAP. Indeed, whereas PfP
included countries as unlikely to join NATO as Russia (because of
historical animosity toward NATO) and Uzbekistan (because of geographic
location), embarking on the MAP meant that a country was now on a path
to membership. As one senior NATO adviser remarked, participating in the
MAP meant that 'there was an open door and it just seemed to make sense
to provide sensible advice' (quoted in
Rudzīte-Stejskala [2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR51),
178--180). Critically for democratic development, this advising included
technical assistance in reforming civil--military relations and supreme
command of the military. In the specific case of the Baltic states,
setting out on a formal path to NATO membership also accorded their
democratic regimes legitimacy by enabling them to provide for the
external security of their states. In other [words, NATO offered
a]{.mark} security [umbrella **necessary** for democratic development to
endure]{.mark}]{.underline}

## Deterrence Theory Good

### General

#### Deterrence theory already considers possibilities of failure but still gives the logical conclusion that the aff is most likely to succeed -- critique of the theory only provides examples of instances where the theory failed, but fails to take down the logics of the theory -- it's a hasty generalization

Achen and Snidal 89 (Christopher H. and Duncan, professor of politics at
Princeton University, professor of international relations at Oxford
University, "Rational Deterrence Theory and Comparative Case Studies,"
1989,
https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/abs/rational-deterrence-theory-and-comparative-case-studies/05B3C8641D5EF6F9A36067EEA0210CCE#:\~:text=Several%20recent%20books%20have%20argued%20that%20comparative%20case,This%20paper%20shows%20that%20such%20contentions%20are%20unwarranted.)

Conversely, if a deterrable initiator believes that it would very likely
not be in the defender\'s interest to retaliate, or that the defender
lacks the means or the will to do so, the initiator will attack. Thus,
under conventional rational-choice assumptions, when the attacker is
deterrable, successful deterrence turns on the defender\'s credibility.
If the latter can convince the attacker that he has the political and
military ability to fight, and that the prize (or his reputation for
fighting when challenged) is worth more to him than the cost of the war,
then, and only then, will a deterrable initiator be deterred.24 This
simple model is less brittle than sometimes thought. Its propositions
are contingent: if the expected punishment exceeds the gain, then
opponents will be deterred. Thus, for example, the model implies that
some conceivable punishment would deter, but not that any particular one
will, nor even any feasible one. Put more strongly, the model implies
that deterrence will fail for sufficiently determined attackers. Not all
conceivable opponents are deterrable.25 [Critics of]{.mark} rational
[deterrence sometimes write as if failures of deterrence were equivalent
to failures of deterrence theory.]{.mark} Levy, for example, notes,
\"this is an ad hoc hypothesis which cannot technically be derived from
any formal theory of deterrence.\"26 [The truth is that the theory
actually predicts some breakdowns.]{.mark} [When deterrence
fails]{.mark} because the retaliatory threat is absent, incredible, or
less valuable than the prize, [the theory has forecast
perfectly]{.mark}. Rational deterrence theory implies that deterrence
will not always be successful. Rational deterrence is very much an
ideal-type explanation. No sensible person pretends that it summarizes
typical deterrence decision making well, or that it exhausts what is to
be said about any one historical case. Yet it has dominated discussion
in all traditions of deterrence research, including historical
investigations. For example, George and Smoke criticize rational
deterrence for its assumption that a government is a rational actor and
can be treated as if it were a single person.2 ? Yet the same authors
summarize their case-study evidence as follows: In almost every
historical case examined, [we found evidence that the initi-
ator]{.mark} tried to [satisfy himself]{.mark} before acting [that the
risks of the particular op- tion he chose could be calculated
and]{.mark}, perhaps more importantly, [con- trolled by him so as to
give his choice of action the character of a rationally calculated,
acceptable risk]{.mark}.28 [The]{.mark} rational unitary-actor [model is
not easily evaded]{.mark}. The power of rational deterrence theory is
conceptual, not mathematical. It derives from the underlying logical
cohesion and consistency with a set of simple first principles, not from
the particular language in which it is expressed. In consequence[, the
model has been astonishingly fecund; both for theory and for
policy]{.mark}. Its surprising implications, now familiar from the
literature, include \"the rationality of irrationality,\" the dangers of
total disarmament, and the value of aiming for strategic equivalence
between the superpowers.29 Perhaps most importantly, it was rational
deterrence theory that sensitized policy makers to the negative aspect
of defensive systems such as civil defense, the ABM, and SDI, which make
first strikes less dangerous. The point is strongly counterintuitive;
indeed, Aleksey Kosygin told Lyndon Johnson at Glassboro that he didn\'t
understand it.30 But this surprising conclusion is a clear implication
of rational deterrence theory. Contrary to George and Smoke\'s view,
[rational deterrence theory has proved itself in practical policy
applications. No other theoretical perspective has had nearly the impact
on American foreign policy]{.mark}, certainly not the conclusions of the
case-study literature. Far from being an abstract, deductivistic theory
developed in a policy vacuum, [rational deterrence theory has repeatedly
taken inspiration from the most pressing policy questions of the
day]{.mark}, from decisions of bomber-basing in the 1950s to SDI in the
1980s. It has set the terms of the debate, and has often influenced the
outcome. One may choose to applaud or decry its impact, but [one cannot
deny that the theory of rational deterrence, like any good theory, has
been of immense practical importance.]{.mark}

### AT Empirical Ev

#### Their empirical examples are only generalizations NOT reasons why deterrence theory in this instance fail -- that a misuse of their case studies 

Achen and Snidal 89 (Christopher H. and Duncan, professor of politics at
Princeton University, professor of international relations at Oxford
University, "Rational Deterrence Theory and Comparative Case Studies,"

[Analysts who employ case studies of deterrence]{.mark} have done well
at producing lists of variables that influence deterrence success, along
with certain empirical generalizations about how different types of
crises unfold. But they have [produced no impressive general
propositions to compare with those of rational deterrence. Case-study
generalizations are not a substitute for theorizing; empirical laws
should not be mistaken for theoretical propositions]{.mark}. More than
anything else, the hallmark of good theory is a fecundity that logically
entails novel,sometimes surprising, insights and predictions. Inductive
\"theory\" lacks this fecundity because it contains too few logical
constraints. Categories can be multiplied to fit all cases.
\"Surprises\" emerge not from the generalization, but from the case.
Hence, we often cannot tell a consequential finding from an artifact;
and when we succeed, the next case makes us begin all over again. By
contrast, [deductive theoretical propositions are of interest precisely
because they interconnect with one another and prevent arbitrary
multiplication of explanatory categories.]{.mark} The investigator is
forced to be coherent. Multiple case studies are also no substitute for
statistical testing of theoretical propositions; [contingent empirical
generalizations should not be confused with confirmed statistical
regularities]{.mark}. Here again, the informal procedures of case-study
analysis provide too few constraints on the imagination of the analyst.
In consequence, [empirical evidence from case studies is rarely strong
enough to falsify a theory. In the case-study]{.mark} literature on
deterrence, these [weaknesses have appeared]{.mark}, first, [in
selection bias]{.mark}---the tendency to oversample deterrence
failures---[and,]{.mark} second, [in the uncritical use of decision
makers\' own reconstructions of their thinking. Each of these virtually
guarantees a negative evaluation of rational deterrence theory, no
matter how well it actually performs]{.mark}. Only statistical analysis,
with its formal criteria for inference, is likely in practice to provide
honest tests of theories. Case studies are an important complement to
both theory-building and statistical investigations, for precisely the
reason Russett and George indicate: they allow a close examination of
historical sequences in the search for causal processes.79 The analyst
is able to identify plausible causal varw Russett (fn. 53); George (fn.
6). RATIONAL DETERRENCE: ACHEN & SNIDAL 169 iables, a task essential to
theory construction and testing. Comparison of historical cases to
theoretical predictions provides a sense of whether the theoretical
story is compelling, and yields indispensable prior knowledge for more
formal tests of explanatory adequacy. The method also generates novel
empirical generalizations, which pose puzzles and challenges for theory
to explain. In all these ways, case studies provide guidance in the
revision and reformulation of analytic theory to account for a broader
range of phenomena. Indeed, analytic theory cannot do without case
studies. Because they are simultaneously sensitive to data and theory,
case studies are more useful for these purposes than any other
methodological tool. [Too often]{.mark}, however, [their findings have
been interpreted as bodies of theory and tests of explanatory
power]{.mark}. It is to these misuses that our criticisms have been
directed.

## AT Verification Procedure Fail in Deterrence Theory

#### That's descriptivist fallacy -- deterrence theory doesn't have to prove that the decision maker's mental choices perfectly align, just that the consequences are aligned with the theory 

Achen and Snidal 89 (Christopher H. and Duncan, professor of politics at
Princeton University, professor of international relations at Oxford
University, "Rational Deterrence Theory and Comparative Case Studies,"
1989,
https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/abs/rational-deterrence-theory-and-comparative-case-studies/05B3C8641D5EF6F9A36067EEA0210CCE#:\~:text=Several%20recent%20books%20have%20argued%20that%20comparative%20case,This%20paper%20shows%20that%20such%20contentions%20are%20unwarranted.)

There is a second objection to the empirical testing of rational
deterrence in comparative case studies---namely, that the verification
procedure fails to engage the rational deterrence theory of how states
behave. In particular, rational deterrence is implicitly misconstrued as
a theory of how decision makers think. Case study analysts have often
expressed the opinion that, if decision makers do not really carry out
the appropriate mental calculations, rational deterrence theory does not
apply. [This argument is the \"descriptivist fallacy.\"]{.mark} As a
glance at any appropriate text will show, the axioms and conclusions of
utility theory refer only to choices. Mental calculations are never
mentioned: the theory makes no reference to them. Indeed, a major reason
for the various axiomatizations of expected-utility theory is to show
that decision makers need not calculate. If they simply respond to
incentives in certain natural ways, their behavior will be describable
by utility functions.65 Rapoport puts it this way: Now, in being asked
to choose between the two \[lottery\] tickets, the man is not asked to
calculate anything. He is asked simply to choose between the two. It is
from his choices that the theoretician will construct the man\'s util-
ity scale on which all the outcomes will be assigned numbers
(utilities).66 To our knowledge, no one who does rational-choice
theorizing disputes this point, but it seems not to be widely
understood. Rational deterrence theory does contain some minimal
psychological content: for example, the initiator must realize that the
defender exists and threatens to defend. But rational deterrence is
agnostic about the actual calculations decision makers undertake. It
holds that they will act as if they solved certain mathematical
problems, whether or not they actually solve them. Just as Steffi Graf
plays tennis as if she did rapid computations in Newtonian physics (and
in game theory, too---at least against Navratilova), so rational
deterrence theory predicts that decision makers will decide whether to
go to war as if they did expected-utility calculations. But they need
not actually perform them.67 To avoid misunderstandings, we want to
point out that our point here has nothing to do with Friedman\'s famous
argument that the truth of assumptions need not matter.68 Friedman
maintained that a theory might sometimes work well for certain purposes,
even though its assumptions were known to be false. We have our doubts;
but whatever its merits, this line of reasoning has no bearing on our
argument. Our point is that [even if decision makers do not actually
calculate, or if they rationalize their actions after the fact with
foolish calculations, the assumptions of rational choice theory may yet
remain true.]{.mark} Understanding what rational deterrence demands of
decision makers is important because it sharply limits what counts
against the theory[. A proper understanding of the theory eliminates
most of the arguments in the historical deterrence literature that are
supposed to overturn it. Consider,]{.mark} for example, [the fact that
many decision makers do not seem to think in terms of probabilities at
all.]{.mark} This point is made by Steinbruner with respect to
Kennedy\'s remark that he faced certain impeachment if he did nothing
about the Cuban missiles;69 Stein has made it in connection with Anwar
Sadat\'s forecasts of various foreign policy consequences, for Egypt in
the early 1970s.70 Both authors maintain that, because each decision
maker failed to discuss probabilities in situations where rational
deterrence theory implies he should, rational deterrence is inaccurate
in describing what happened. Related arguments have been advanced by
Jervis and by Betts.7 \' These conclusions do not follow. [Let us repeat
that rational deterrence theory deals with choices, not mental
calculations. It makes no predictions about what decision makers say
influenced them, only about what actually did so]{.mark}. The
distinction is particularly important in the case of postdecision
reconstructions. As diplomatic historians have long been aware, the
historical record often differs sharply from decision makers\' memories,
even memories about their own thoughts at the time.72 Since the critics
of deterrence wish to adduce evidence that is not only dubious but
apparently irrelevant to the theory under discussion, they bear the
burden of proof. They must show that no plausible psychological
mechanisms could have introduced a gap between the reality and the
reconstruction, and they must demonstrate that what decision makers say
influenced them is identical with what actually happened. Neither Stein
nor Steinbruner have made such a case. Indeed, several plausible
psychological mechanisms would render their evidence
irrelevant---mechanisms of the sort that they and others have often put
forward as key factors in international decision making. Suppose, then,
that decision makers actually behave according to rational-choice
theory. Indeed, no matter what he said, it is hard to believe that
Kennedy\'s Cubanmissile decisions were unaffected by the difference
between a.possibility of impeachment, a livelihood of impeachment, and a
certainty of impeachment. But suppose that, like the rest of us, Kennedy
subsequently bolstered his decision by thinking and saying that any
other choice would have brought on unpleasant political consequences
with certainty. If so, he would speak in the apparently nonrational
language that he actually used, but his behavior would be predicted
perfectly by rationality assumptions. Obvious competing interpretations
like this one have not been excluded by the critics of rational
deterrence. It is not easy to do so. Indeed, no matter how detailed the
historical records, disagreements break out routinely over
interpretations of decision makers\' thoughts and intentions.73 The
degree of uncertainty in historical interpretations of motive and
intention is often substantial, and conclusions deriving from such
interpretations must be discounted appropriately. Yet case-study
analysts usually provide no assessment of the reliability of their
historical judgments. In particular, without a detailed showing that the
questionable memories of decision makers represent the historical
process accurately, no amount of evidence about their apparent
calculation errors is relevant to the issue of whether rational
deterrence theory predicts decision making.\^ In the absence of such a
showing, rational deterrence theory stands unrebutted.75 It is not our
central point here to set out one particular list of inferential slips
by case-study analysts. After all, one can imagine case studies that
select cases in a nonprejudicial fashion, and that take proper account
of the fallibility in assessments of decision makers\' intentions.
Well-designed case-study tests may not be decisive, but they can be
highly enlightening and strongly persuasive.?6 They are certainly an
indispensable first step before proceeding to statistical methods---a
point quantitative researchers have too often ignored at their peril. In
principle, case studies are capable of doing everything statistical
analysis can do; they may simply replace symbols with words and
replicate the random samples, precise definitions, and rigorous
inferences of statistical methods. But in practice, inferential rigor is
not the best tool for what case studies should accomplish, and the
comparative method works best when it enforces no such discipline. As
Jack Snyder notes, \"The best analysts in the \[case study\] field have
always used a rough-and-ready version of the scientific method,\" which
they have identified, not with the powerful counterintuitive logic of
the real McCoy, but rather with the substantially tamer
\"self-conscious, systematic application of commonsense rules of
inference.\"77 When the purposes of comparative case studies are
properly understood, informality is the right choice. Creativity is
enhanced when historical cases can be chosen at liberty and analyzed in
accord with the investigator\'s intuitions. The great many degrees of
freedom in these studies are inordinately helpful in finding useful
variables and producing empirical generalizations. Like all good things,
however, this free play for unaided common sense has a price. Used in
isolation from scientific methods, it creates inevitable inferential
errors and makes decisive theory verification well-nigh impossible. In
case studies of rational deterrence, the consequences have been both
predictable and devastating for the credibility of their conclusions

## AT: Root Case -- War

#### War is caused by leadership succession, democracy necessary to curtail

Chares **Lipson**, 20**13**. Leadership Succession as a Cause of War:
The Structural Advantage of Democracies. Princeton: Princeton University
Press, pp. 112--38, doi:10.1515/9781400850723.112.

The last chapter dealt  with all four  sources of the  democratic
contracting advantage: transparency, audience costs, constitutionalism,
and continuity of regimes. This chapter continues the examination of
regime continuity, focusing on leadership succession. **Succession
crises are a frequent source of wars**. **Democracies are systematically
better at averting** them and, hence, at averting the **wars** that stem
from them. Because democracies have solved the succession problem
internally, they avoid its most dangerous consequences externally. My
main point, however, is not simply that succession crises produce wars.
They obviously do. My aim is to show how they block the path to peace,
mainly by creating vast uncertainties and obstructing long-term bargains
that could prevent war.

[Perfect Deterrence Theory has been developed as an alternative to
classical deterrence theory]{.underline}. We have become interested in
the theory as it seems to be aesthetically more appealing than classical
deterrence theory. [It provides another way of looking at deterrence
but, this time, without its internal structure plagued by logical
inconsistency.]{.underline} As Frank Zagare & Kilgour, the creators of
Perfect Deterrence Theory, explain in their co-authored book 'Perfect
Deterrence,'3 classical deterrence theory suffers from what is known as
the paradox of mutual deterrence. [Classical deterrence e theory hinges
on the fact that the status quo is reinforced as the cost of conflict
becomes higher.]{.underline} However, logic dictates that the status quo
is not a rational choice when both States (A & B) prefer capitulation to
conflict when challenged. The status quo is not a Nash equilibrium7 in
the standard 2 x 2 game of Chicken in which there are four outcomes
(i.e., A wins, B wins, status quo and conflict). [The game of Chicken
was a tool favored by classical deterrence theorists as it captured
essential aspects of deterrence during the age of nuclear confrontation
between the United States and the Soviet Union, as it was then. In this
game, conflict is understandably assumed to be the worst choice and,
hence, the contradiction ensues. The proponents of classical deterrence
theory are yet to provide a satisfactory resolution to this logical
inconsistency although various attempts have been made.8 Perfect
Deterrence Theory was also developed to overcome the empirical
deficiencies of classical deterrence theory.]{.underline} Zagare &
Kilgour point out that the 'power imbalance' is a poor indicator for
measuring the likelihood of war as there have been many instances of war
fought between two states with roughly equal power, World War II between
Britain and Germany for one. [There is little empirical support for
associating the power imbalance with the likelihood of war. It is a
prerequisite that a good theory must stand up reasonably well to
empirical evidence. Overall, Perfect Deterrence Theory's predictions are
more in agreement with empirical findings. Here are some distinguishing
features of Perfect Deterrence Theory. As explained, in classical
deterrence theory, the cost of conflict plays a 'central' role in
deterring an adversary. Hence, it makes a perfect sense for a state to
stock up on more powerful weapons to deter the adversary. These weapons
will unleash more destructive power, thereby significantly raising the
cost of conflict which, in turn, reduces the possibility of
conflict]{.underline}.9 [Any adversary would think twice before
challenging to upset the status quo]{.underline}. [However,]{.underline}
as Zagare & Kilgour point out, [this model of deterrence is deficient in
the sense that there is no maximum limit on the cost of conflict (i.e.,
that is, a state should just keep on accumulating stockpiles of ever
more destructive weapons as long as it can monetarily afford them).
There is no built-in mechanism within the model that provides the
maximum limit. Such a limit can be shown to exist inherently in some
models of Perfect Deterrence Theory, beyond which further strengthening
of deterrence becomes totally redundant (i.e., making a case for minimum
deterrence). This is a desirable feature to have in the model of
deterrence]{.underline}. [The theory also gives due consideration to the
importance of maintaining the 'status quo' which is somehow neglected in
the past. The status quo did not receive much attention, as the focus
was heavily on the cost of conflict.]{.underline} The emphasis was on
the punishment side. Moreover, States A and B no longer have to be
undifferentiated in the theory. If needed, one state can be specifically
designated as challenger determined to upset the status quo while the
other state, as defender, is determined to keep the status quo. [This
will better approximate a realworld situation. 'Capability' and
'credibility' are two critical variables in the analysis of a deterrence
situation. In Perfect Deterrence Theory, capability is defined as one's
ability to hurt the other (i.e., adversary) while credibility is defined
in terms of one's willingness to fight rather than
capitulate.]{.underline} These variables together with other utility
variables (e.g., a utility for A wins, B wins, Status Quo and Conflict)
are used to determine rational choices and the conditions under which
those choices exist. These conditions usually take the form of
mathematical inequalities and many insights are gained through analyzing
these inequalities. At some decision points in the game (or tree),10 it
may be necessary that States A and B update their belief about the
other's determination to fight rather than capitulate based on
conditional probability.11 Zagare & Kilgour provide all mathematical
details in the appendix section of their book.3, 12 Their work is firmly
founded on logic and, hence, model predictions are the direct
consequences of a rational decision-making process. In practice,
rational choices are nothing but Nash equilibria. Determining these
choices simply amounts to finding Nash equilibria. [There can be more
than one Nash equilibrium under a given condition, which is perhaps a
less desirable feature of the theory as it loses
predictability.]{.underline} It is simply not possible to know which
course of action will be taken in a situation with multiple Nash
equilibria.13 Hence, multiple equilibria may be able to explain the
success or failure of a deterrence situation that has occurred in the
past. One can only hypothesize which one might have been in play. In the
theory, only a Nash equilibrium that fulfills Selten's 'Perfectness'
condition (i.e., being subgame-perfect) is thought to be a 'rational'
choice. [This condition is used to eliminate all choices which have at
least one incredible (a technical term as explained later) decision made
along the decision path. Only subgame-perfect Nash equilibria are of
true interest as they are free of irrationalities. Accordingly, Zagare &
Kilgour have named their deterrence theory with this game theory term
'Perfect' in front. It does not mean 'Perfect Deterrence' in the
ordinary sense of 'perfect,' as such deterrence has never existed and
never will.]{.underline} Perfect Deterrence Theory has been specifically
chosen to be the basis of our study for these reasons. We sought to draw
out valuable implications for South Korea based on Zagare & Kilgour's
findings.[3 Basically, what can this deterrence theory tell us about
strengthening **the security** of South Korea and continuing to preserve
peace and stability in the face of North Korea's growing nuclear
threat?]{.underline} In the next chapter, basic concepts in Perfect
Deterrence Theory are reviewed.

#### Perfect deterrence theory is accurate and robust.

**Quackenbush 10**. Stephen L. Quackenbush is Associate Professor of
Political Science at the University of Missouri. He received his PhD in
2003 from the University at Buffalo, SUNY.** **Stephen L.
Quackenbush (2010) General Deterrence and International Conflict:
Testing Perfect Deterrence Theory, International
Interactions, 36:1, 60-85, DOI: [10.1080/03050620903554069](https://doi.org/10.1080/03050620903554069)

The specific purpose is to fill this evidentiary gap by subjecting
perfect deterrence theory---a recently developed theory of general
deterrence---to a systematic test. I do so for several reasons. First[,
perfect deterrence theory]{.underline} (Zagare and Kilgour 2000[) is
supported by a **formal logic** with explicit theoretical expectations
that facilitates empirical testing]{.underline}.
Second, [several preliminary tests of perfect deterrence theory have
rendered promising]{.underline}, albeit provisional results (Senese and
Quackenbush 2003; Quackenbush and Zagare 2006).1 And finally, as Huth
(1999) points out, standard formulations of deterrence---to the extent
that they have been explored empirically---are without compelling
support. [Perfect deterrence theory is an axiomatically distinct
theoretical alternative to classical deterrence theory, which focuses on
ideas such as brinkmanship and mutual assured
destruction]{.underline}. [Perfect deterrence theory highlights the
importance of two variables: capability and credibility.]{.underline} [A
state's threat is capable if the threatened party believes that it would
be worse off if the threat were carried out than if it were not. For
example, if Defender has a capable threat, then Challenger prefers
Status Quo to Conflict. One additional equilibrium---Steadfast
Deterrence Equilibrium---exists. As with the Certain Deterrence
Equilibrium, Status Quo is the only possible outcome]{.underline}.
However, [this equilibrium exists at intermediate and **high values of
Defender credibility**]{.underline}, and thus coexists with equilibria
of other types. Therefore, through the Steadfast Deterrence
Equilibrium, [perfect deterrence theory predicts that the Status Quo is
always possible as long as Defender's threat is capable]{.underline}.
Thus, Zagare and Kilgour's (2000:149) claim that successful "[deterrence
could conceivably emerge under (almost) any conditions in a one-sided
deterrence relationship]{.underline}." hese independent variables
constitute the equilibrium outcome predictions of perfect deterrence
theory. However, a number of alternative explanations of international
behavior exist. Therefore, several control variables, representing the
major foci of recent conflict studies, are used to test the robustness
of the results obtained. Some of these variables (particularly relative
power and S score) are components of the utility functions that form the
basis of the equilibrium predictions to be tested. However, it is
possible that these variables exert an independent influence on
deterrence outcomes in addition to their influence on equilibrium
predictions. Furthermore, since these individual components are combined
in a different, nonlinear fashion within the unilateral deterrence game
to generate equilibrium predictions, multicollinearity between the
equilibrium predictions and the control variables is not present.16 To
examine the robustness of these results against alternative
explanations, the full multinomial logit model was run including the
control variables. The full model, shown in Table 3, produces a highly
significant fit to the data. The results of the full model indicate that
the predictions of perfect deterrence theory are quite robust.
Therefore, perfect deterrence theory's predictions of Status Quo,
Defender Concedes, Challenger Defeated, and Conflict are all strongly
supported by the empirical record, and these predictions are robust
against alternative explanations. Thus[, perfect deterrence theory
provides a proportional reduction in the error of non-status quo
predictions of 20 percent. Although improvement is always possible,
these results nonetheless support perfect deterrence
theory]{.underline}.

#### The military is necessary for the stability and to deter aggression

[Our [defense science and technology investment enables]{.mark} [us to
counter military threats]{.mark} and to overcome any advantages that
adversaries may seek. It also [expands the military options available to
policymakers, including options other than warfare in pursuing the
objectives of promoting stability and preventing
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. Science and technology [[help to
**counter special threats such as terrorism**]{.underline}]{.mark} that
cannot be met by conventional warfighting forces, and they underpin the
intelligence capabilities necessary to assess the dangers our nation
faces. The U.S. military also relies on science and technology to make
our advanced military systems more affordable through their entire life
cycle. [And by maintaining a close dialogue with the warfighters, the
defense S&T community not only remains sensitive to user needs but also
sensitizes the user to the possibilities that technology offers for
responding to evolving threats. [U.S. military capabilities]{.mark} not
only [protect the United States and its citizens from direct threats,
they]{.mark} also [help maintain peace and stability in regions critical
to U.S. interests]{.mark} and underwrite U.S. defense commitments around
the world]{.underline}. Maintaining a strong defense capability means
that the U.S. Armed Forces, and the Department of Defense more broadly,
must be prepared to conduct the following kinds of missions, as
described in the President\'s national security strategy: [[Deterring
and defeating aggression in major regional conflicts. U.S. forces must
be capable of offsetting the military power]{.mark} of regional states
with interests opposed to those of the United States and its allies. To
do this, the United States must be able to deter and, if necessary,
defeat aggression, in concert with regional allies, by projecting and
sustaining U.S. power in two major regional conflicts that occur nearly
simultaneously.]{.underline} Providing credible overseas presence. [Some
U.S. forces must be forward deployed or stationed in key overseas
regions in peacetime. These [deployments contribute to a more **stable
and** **secure** international environment]{.mark} by demonstrating U.S.
commitment, deterring aggression, and underwriting important bilateral
and multilateral security relationships]{.underline}. Forward stationing
and periodic deployments also permit U.S. forces to gain familiarity
with overseas operating environments, promote joint and combined
training among friendly forces, improve interoperability with friendly
forces throughout the world, and respond in a timely manner to crises.
Conducting contingency operations. The United States must be prepared to
undertake a wide range of contingency operations in support of U.S.
interests. These operations include smaller-scale combat operations,
multilateral peace operations, noncombatant evacuations,
counterterrorism activities, and humanitarian and disaster relief
operations. [Countering weapons of mass destruction. While the United
States is redoubling its efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction and associated missile delivery systems, we must at
the same time improve our military capabilities to deter and prevent the
effective use of these weapons]{.underline}. We are pursuing this
objective by sustaining adequate retaliatory capabilities and by
increasing our capabilities to defend against weapons of mass
destruction, to locate and neutralize or destroy them before they are
used during a conflict, and to fight in an environment in which such
weapons have been used. Finally, to meet all these requirements
successfully, U.S. forces must be capable of responding quickly and
operating effectively across a wide range of environments. That is, they
must be ready to fight. Such high combat readiness demands well
qualified and motivated people; adequate amounts of modern,
well-maintained equipment; realistic training; strategic mobility; and
sufficient support and sustainment capabilities.

## Alt fails

### Empirics

#### Alt fails -- US Military isn't perfect but Obama admin proves demilitarization is impossible 

John R. **Deni**, 10-30-20**15**, \"Obama's Failure to Demilitarize U.S.
Foreign Policy,\" War on the Rocks,

College's Strategic Studies Institute.//CDMoney

The [Obama administration]{.underline} has [received much attention for
its policy of rebalancing to]{.underline} the [Asia-Pacific]{.underline}
region. The rebalance has been described as President Obama's signature
foreign policy initiative. Launched in 2009, it has received much
attention from academics, practitioners, think tanks, and the media. In
reality, the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific has been more evolutionary
than revolutionary; a U.S. shift in focus and grand strategy began well
before President Obama's inauguration in January 2009. If the Obama
presidency in fact initiated a revolutionary rebalancing, it [was his
effort to rebalance American foreign policy generally from over-reliance
on the military and toward greater reliance on diplomacy and
development.]{.underline} Despite a concerted effort, [when viewed
through several lenses it **seems clear that demilitarization has
failed** **and U.S. foreign policy remains very, perhaps overly,
militarized.**]{.underline} As a result, the Pentagon can expect to be
handed messy military operations short of inter-state war that it may
not be prepared, equipped, or organized to handle efficiently or
effectively. In the 2008 presidential campaign, candidate Barack Obama
pledged to correct what he perceived as a fundamental imbalance between
the three-legged stool that comprises U.S. foreign policy ­--- defense,
diplomacy, and development --- through such measures as expanding the
State Department's Foreign Service. Once in office, the Obama
administration expressed its intent to rebalance away from defense and
toward diplomacy and development though a variety of strategies as well
as policy statements. Most recently, the 2015 National Security Strategy
explicitly notes that military force is not the sole means of achieving
U.S. national security objectives, arguing, "our first line of action is
principled and clear-eyed diplomacy, combined with the central role of
development in the forward defense and promotion of America's
interests." In addition to published strategies and policy
pronouncements, the Obama administration repeatedly emphasized diplomacy
and development in policy implementation over, or instead of,
large-scale military measures. Across a number of issues, the
administration has sought to rely less on overwhelming American military
power to accomplish foreign policy objectives. A short list of examples
could include maintaining drawdown timelines in Iraq and (with some
modification) in Afghanistan, "leading from behind" in Libya, nuclear
negotiations with Iran, and relying on sanctions to pressure Russia's
withdrawal from Ukraine. [Relying on diplomatic, political, and
development-based solutions typically takes time to bear fruit. In
contrast, wielding military force often yields results more quickly,
even if the apparent success is illusory in the long run.]{.underline}
Critics of the [Obama approach conflate the emphasis on diplomacy with
indecision, and hence weakness.]{.underline} However, the tragedy of
President [Obama's rebalance toward diplomacy and development is not
that it represents an America in retreat, but rather that the rebalance
has not succeeded in demilitarizing U.S. foreign policy,]{.underline} as
seen in three separate contexts. [First, available fiscal data show the
continuing dominance of defense spending relative to international
affairs spending.]{.underline} [Even under sequestration scenarios, that
budget will continue to dwarf the amount of money spent on diplomacy and
development.]{.underline} [Second, despite congressional concerns about
the risks of granting the Department of Defense increased authority in
security cooperation, Congress continues to do just that. The Department
of Defense continues to expand its activities into areas over which the
State Department previously had purview. Finally]{.underline}, based on
several examples over the last two decades or more, many experts,
practitioners, and observers have concluded that the [**civilian
instruments of American foreign policy** simply **lack** the capacity
and **capability to handle the complex, large-scale challenges facing
U.S. national security.**]{.underline} In particular, the challenge of
failed or failing states has laid bare Washington's inability to
implement so-called "whole of government" solutions. As a result, the
Department of Defense continues to be the problem-solving agency of
choice for legislators as well as those in the executive branch. The
[implications of a continued militarization of American foreign policy
are significant, most consequentially for the U.S.
military.]{.underline} Despite political intent and rhetoric, the
[Department of Defense is very likely to be relied upon again and again
to achieve national security objectives, both within and outside its
particular areas of competence. As such, it should take some preparatory
steps. First, the **military** services should **make a more holistic**,
institutional **commitment to embrace security cooperation** as a core
mission. **There is** some **evidence that this is
underway**,]{.underline} but there is much room for improvement,
especially in terms of doctrine, acquisition, and personnel policies.
Second, the military needs to improve its ability to assess whether and
where security cooperation tools are likely to be successful. All too
often, the U.S. military becomes a captive of its "can-do" attitude,
despite what seem like obvious and insurmountable challenges in
hindsight. Finally, if the best military advice is ignored by senior
policymakers on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, the Department of
Defense needs to recognize and prepare for "muddling through" missions
it may only have a small chance of achieving. Hence, the U.S. military
must prepare for a future not terribly unlike the very recent past,
characterized by messy stability operations, hybrid warfare, and
disorder short of major interstate war.

### Russia 

#### Alt is a romanticized pipe dream of demilitarization -- Ukraine proves Russia will take advantage

**Broad, 22** (William J. Broad, 2-5-2022, accessed on 7-20-2022, The
New York Times, \"Ukraine Gave Up Nuclear Weapons 30 Years Ago. Today
There Are Regrets.\",
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/05/science/ukraine-nuclear-weapons.html)

[At the end of the Cold War, the **[third largest nuclear power]{.mark}
on earth [was]{.mark}** not Britain, France or China. It was
**[Ukraine]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The Soviet collapse, a slow-motion
downfall that culminated in December 1991, resulted in the newly
independent Ukraine inheriting roughly 5,000 nuclear arms that Moscow
had stationed on its soil. Underground silos on its military bases held
long-range missiles that carried up to 10 thermonuclear warheads, each
far stronger than the bomb that leveled Hiroshima. [Only Russia and the
United States had more weapons. **The [removal of]{.mark} this [arsenal
often]{.mark} [gets hailed as]{.mark} a [triumph]{.mark} of arms
control.** Diplomats and peace activists cast Ukraine as a model citizen
in a world of would-be nuclear powers. But **[history shows]{.mark}**
the **[denuclearization to have been]{.mark} a [chaotic upheaval]{.mark}
that [shook with infighting, reversals and discord am]{.mark}ong the
[country's government and military.]{.mark}**]{.underline} At the time,
both Ukrainian and American [experts questioned the wisdom of atomic
disarmament. The **[deadly weapons]{.mark}**, some argued,
**[were]{.mark} the [only reliable means of deterring Russian
aggression]{.mark}**. Today Ukraine has no easy path to producing or
acquiring the materials to build a bomb.]{.underline} Even so, the
nuclear genie is once again stirring as Russian troops encircle the
nation and wage a shadow war in its easternmost provinces. ["**[We gave
away]{.mark} the [capability for nothing]{.mark}**," said Andriy
Zahorodniuk, a former defense minister of Ukraine.]{.underline}
Referring to the security assurances Ukraine won in exchange for its
nuclear arms, he added: "Now, every time somebody offers us to sign a
strip of paper, the response is, 'Thank you very much. We already had
one of those some time ago.'" Western analysts say the current Ukrainian
mood tends to romanticize the atomic past. "The gist is, 'We had the
weapons, gave them up and now look what's happening,'" said Mariana
Budjeryn, a Ukraine specialist at Harvard University. "On a policy
level, I see no movement toward any kind of reconsideration. But on a
popular level, that's the narrative." ["Regret is part of it," Dr.
Budjeryn, a Ukrainian native, added in an interview. "The other part is
whatever one feels as a result of being subjected to
injustice."]{.underline} At first, Ukraine rushed to get the Soviet arms
off its soil. Bombs, artillery shells, land mines and the relatively
small warheads atop short-range missiles were the easiest to relocate
and most likely to fall into unfriendly hands. More difficult to move
were the long-range missiles, which could weigh 100 tons and rise to a
height of nearly 90 feet. In January 1992, a month after the Soviet
Union ceased to exist, Ukraine's president and defense minister ordered
military commanders and their men to pledge loyalty to the new country
--- a move that would exert administrative control over the remaining
arms. Many refused, and the soldiers who managed Ukraine's nuclear
forces fell into a period of tense bewilderment over the fate of the
arsenal and its operational status. [**[Volodymyr Tolubko]{.mark}**, a
former nuclear-base commander who had been elected to the Ukrainian
Parliament, **[argued]{.mark} that** Kyiv should never give up its
atomic edge. In April 1992, he told the assembly that **[it was
"romantic and premature" for Ukraine to declare itself]{.mark} a
[nonnuclear]{.mark} state** and insisted that it should retain at least
some of its long-range warheads. **A [residual missile force]{.mark}, he
declared, [would]{.mark} be enough to "[deter any
aggressor]{.mark}."**]{.underline} While his stance never gained wide
support, "it compounded existing tensions," according to a detailed
history of Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. In the summer of 1993, John J.
Mearsheimer, a prominent international relations theorist at the
University of Chicago who was no stranger to controversy, lent his voice
to the issue of atomic retention. He argued in Foreign Affairs that a
nuclear arsenal was "imperative" if Ukraine was "to maintain peace." The
deterrent, he added, would ensure that the Russians, "who have a history
of bad relations with Ukraine, do not move to reconquer it." In Kyiv,
the government in 1993 went so far as to consider seizing operational
control of its nuclear missiles and bombers. But that never came to
pass. Instead, Ukraine punted. It demanded that, in exchange for nuclear
disarmament, it would need ironclad security guarantees. That was the
heart of the agreement signed in Moscow early in 1994 by Russia, Ukraine
and the United States. In late 1994, the pledges got fleshed out. [The
accord, known as **the [Budapest Memorandum, signed by Russia]{.mark},
Ukraine, Britain and the United States, [promised that none of]{.mark}
the [nations would use force]{.mark} or threats [against Ukraine and all
would respect its sovereignty]{.mark} and existing borders. The
agreement also [vowed]{.mark} that, [if aggression took place]{.mark},
the [signatories would seek]{.mark} [immediate action]{.mark} from the
United Nations Security Council [to aid Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
While Kyiv had failed to get what it wanted --- the kind of legally
binding guarantees that would come with a formal treaty ratified by the
U.S. Senate --- it received assurances that Washington would take its
political commitments as seriously as its legal obligations, according
to Dr. Budjeryn, a research analyst at the Managing the Atom project at
Harvard's Kennedy School[. In May 1996, Ukraine saw the last of its
nuclear arms transported back to Russia]{.underline}. The repatriations
had taken a half decade. What undid the diplomatic feat was the
"collective failure" of Washington and Kyiv to take into account the
rise of someone like Vladimir V. Putin, Steven Pifer, a negotiator of
the Budapest Memorandum and a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine now at
Stanford University, said in an interview. After Russian troops invaded
Crimea in early 2014 and stepped up a proxy war in eastern Ukraine, Mr.
Putin dismissed the Budapest accord as null and void. "They've been
fighting a low-grade war for eight years," Mr. Pifer, who just returned
from Kyiv, said of the Ukrainians. "You can't find bullets in the
stores. A lot of civilians are arming up." In Ukraine, the Crimean
invasion and the lengthy war led to a series of calls for atomic
rearmament, according to Dr. Budjeryn, author of "Inheriting the Bomb,"
a forthcoming book from Johns Hopkins University Press. In March 2014,
[**[Volodymyr Ohryzko]{.mark}**, a former foreign minister,
**[argued]{.mark} that [Ukraine]{.mark} now [had]{.mark} the [moral and
legal right to reestablish]{.mark} its [nuclear status]{.mark}**. In
July, an ultranationalist parliamentary bloc introduced a bill for
arsenal reacquisition. Later that year, a poll showed that **[public
approval stood at]{.mark}** nearly **[50 percent for]{.mark} [nuclear
rearmament]{.mark}**. Last year, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy
Melnyk, said **Kyiv might look to nuclear arms if it cannot become a
member of NATO. ["How else can we guarantee our defense?"]{.mark}** Mr.
Melnyk asked]{.underline}.

### T/ -- Demil esc

#### Demilitarization decks deterrence theory, which guarantees escalation

**Mazarr 20** (Michael Mazarr, Senior Political Scientist and Researcher
at RAND Corporation, 12-3-2020, accessed on 7-20-2022, NL ARMS
Netherlands Annual Review of Military Studies 2020: Deterrence in the
21st Century---Insights from Theory and Practice, \"Three Fundamental
Conditions for Successful Deterrence\", )

Much of [**[classic deterrence theory can be boiled down to]{.mark} a
simple proposition: The [potential aggressor]{.mark} [must
believe]{.mark} that the [defender has]{.mark} the [capability]{.mark}
and will [to do what it threatens]{.mark}**.36 This criterion is, again,
perceptual: The question is not whether the defender actually has such
capabilities or will, it is whether the aggressor believes that it
does.]{.underline} [**[Deterrence depends on]{.mark} the [perception
of]{.mark} the "[threatener's determination to fulfil the threat]{.mark}
if need be"---[and]{.mark}, more importantly, on the potential
[aggressor's "conviction]{.mark} that the [threat will be carried
out]{.mark}"**. 37 **[Deterrence fails]{.mark}, Bruce Russett concludes,
"[when]{.mark} the [attacker decides]{.mark} that the defender's [threat
is]{.mark} not likely [to be fulfilled]{.mark}.**"]{.underline} 38 This
axiom highlights two distinct factors---capability and will. Perceived
weakness in either can undermine deterrence. Capability is
straightforward enough. As suggested earlier, the immediate, local
balance of forces is not always a key determinant of deterrence
success---but **[a defender's broadly perceived suite of capabilities,
military and otherwise, must be strong enough to convince a potential
attacker that it is likely to pay a heavy price for
aggression.]{.underline}** Will is a much more abstract variable and
easily subject to misperception. Aggressors have repeatedly convinced
themselves that a defender did not have the will to respond, especially
in cases of extended deterrence. Will is partly a function of the
national interests involved: If a defender is seen to have vital
interests at stake, a potential attacker will believe threats of
response. **[[Aggressors can]{.mark} try to [undermine]{.mark} a
[defender's willingness to respond by]{.mark} using "[salami slicing"
approaches---]{.mark}using a [long series of low-level]{.mark}
[aggressions to change]{.mark} the [facts on]{.mark} the [ground
]{.mark}]{.underline}**without ever taking action that would justify a
major response. [Such strategies are designed to put the defender in a
dilemma: It cannot respond to every small violation, but if it does not
begin to punish minor transgressions, its strategic position will erode
over time. The United States confronts this challenge with Chinese and
Russian grey-zone campaigns today.]{.underline}

#### NATO is key to global peace -- demilitarization would cause China & Russia escalation

**Binnendijk, 19** (Hans Binnendijk, 3-19-2019, accessed on 7-20-2022,
Defense News, \"5 consequences of a life without NATO\",
https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/03/19/5-consequences-of-a-life-without-nato/)

[**The [most catastrophic impact of NATO's retirement would be]{.mark}**
the risk of **[Russian aggression and miscalculation]{.mark}.**
**[Without]{.mark} a clear [commitment to defend allied
territory]{.mark} backed up [by]{.mark} an [American nuclear
deterrent,]{.mark} President Vladimir [Putin will]{.mark}** certainly
**[see opportunities to seize land]{.mark}** he believes is Russian. He
has already done this in Georgia and Ukraine. Had they not joined NATO,
the Baltic states would probably already be occupied by Russian
troops.]{.underline} Certainly Putin would also see an opportunity to
seize more of Ukraine without the "shadow" of NATO to protect it.
[History teaches us that [**major wars start** **when aggressive leaders
miscalculate**]{.mark}. German leader Adolf **[Hitler attacked
Poland]{.mark} in 1939, [believing]{.mark}** that after then-British
Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's Munich Agreement**, [England would
be unlikely to respond]{.mark}. [North Korea attacked South
Korea]{.mark} in 1950 [after]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[appeared to remove Seoul from]{.mark} its [defensive
perimeter]{.mark}**. Iraqi leader **[Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait]{.mark} in 1990, [believing]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates** had signaled that it **[would not respond]{.mark}**.
In each case, miscalculation led to larger conflict.]{.underline}
Secondly, NATO's retirement would also decrease American military reach,
its political influence and its economic advantage. American bases
throughout Europe not only provide for the defense of Europe --- they
bring the U.S. a continent closer to trouble spots that threaten vital
American interests. Fighting the Islamic State group, clearly an
American interest, would have been markedly more difficult without
permanent U.S. bases in Europe and without the American-built coalition
that included every NATO nation. Without NATO, the mutual security
interests that underpin both U.S. bases and coalition operations would
be undermined. This extends to the economic realm. U.S. annual trade in
goods and services with Europe exceeds \$1 trillion, and U.S. total
direct investment in Europe nears \$3 trillion. These economic ties
enhance U.S. prosperity and provide American jobs, but they require the
degree of security now provided by NATO to endure. NATO's retirement
would thirdly exacerbate divisions within Europe. NATO's glue not only
holds European militaries together --- it provides the principal forum
to discuss and coordinate security issues. [The European Union is
unlikely to substitute for NATO in this respect because it has no
military structure, few capabilities and no superpower leadership to
bring divergent views together]{.underline}. Germany and France already
seek a plan B should NATO collapse, but without the United Kingdom in
the European Union, an all-European approach is likely to fail. [The
**[added insecurity]{.mark} of NATO's collapse [would]{.mark}** also
**[amplify]{.mark}** current **[populist movements in Europe]{.mark}.**
The **[consequence could be renationalization of European
militaries]{.mark}**, a system **that brought conflict to the 19th and
early 20th centuries**.]{.underline} The fourth consequences of life
without NATO would be global. American bilateral alliances in Asia would
each be shaken to their core should NATO fail. [America's defense
commitments there would become worthless. With China determined to claim
a dominant position in Asia, the collapse of NATO would cause America's
Asian partners to seek accommodation with China, much as the Philippines
is in the process of doing. Trump's decision to abandon the economic
Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement has already given China new
advantages in the region. **[Without]{.mark} credible [American security
commitments]{.mark}, [there would be little to stop China from]{.mark}
[controlling]{.mark} the [South China Sea]{.mark} and** probably
**[occupying Taiwan]{.mark} as well**]{.underline}. Add to this equation
the new footholds that China is building in central Asia, Africa and
Europe: Abandoning NATO would help assure China's competitive success[.
The **final impact of [NATO's retirement would be]{.mark} the** near
**[collapse of]{.mark}** what has been called the "**[l]{.mark}iberal
[i]{.mark}nternational [o]{.mark}rder."**]{.underline} This order
consists of [**treaties, alliances, agreements, institutions and modes
of behavior** mostly created by the United States in an effort **to
safeguard democracies. This [order has kept]{.mark} relative
[peace]{.mark} in the trans-Atlantic space [for seven
decades]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Trump administration has begun to
unravel elements of this order in the naive notion that they undercut
American sovereignty. The entire European project is built on the
edifice of this order. [NATO is its principal keystone. Collapsing this
edifice would undercut the multiple structures that have brought seven
decades of peace and prosperity.]{.underline} S

## **Nuclear Deterrence Good**

#### **Effective Nuclear deterrence reduces the risk for both Nuclear and Conventional conflict between Nuclear Powers.**

ClimatePartnerItalia To What Extent is Nuclear Deterrence Important in
the Post-Cold War World?
https://www.e-ir.info/2013/06/04/to-what-extent-is-nuclear-deterrence-important-in-the-post-cold-war-world/

[The eventuality of a nuclear attack has always represented one of the
most dangerous threats to the safety **of a country, inasmuch the
precision and lethality of nuclear devices permit an adversary to
cripple in an extremely short period of time** **the command, control
and communication (C3) structure of the attacked state, in what is
called a "decapitation strike"** (]{.underline}Walton, 2010: 215).
**[The only effective deterrent for such an attack remains the threat of
another nuclear strike, in what is called a "second-strike
capability".]{.underline}** Anyway, today's nuclear threats are
extremely different from the ones that lead to the establishment of the
classic balance of terror during the Cold War. In a 2008 report, the US
Secretary of Defense indicates as the current most urgent causes for
concern terrorism and nuclear proliferation (US Secretary of Defense,
2008: 9). The two phenomena are closely linked, since the two most
likely scenarios of terrorist acquisition of nuclear weapons --
acquisition of HEU (highly enriched uranium) with or without the
assistance of a government and theft or transfer of a completed weapon
-- require the existence of a nuclear arsenal in a sympathising or
unreliable country (Gallucci, 2006: 53). As previously said, the main
strategy developed to deal with the threat of a nuclear attack conducted
by a non-state actor is expanded deterrence; anyhow, this measure must
be implemented by steps to prevent horizontal nuclear proliferation,
that is, the growth in the number of actors armed with nuclear weapons.
In fact, the enlargement of the nuclear club has increased the
likelihood of a nuclear strike taking place: since a single weapon is
sufficient to conduct such an attack, it can be deduced that, while
vertical proliferation (the growth in the number of warheads within a
country) does not make the eventuality of such an attack more likely,
horizontal proliferation does. Nuclear deterrence has traditionally been
associated with the neorealist view that a world with more nuclear
actors, and ideally a world composed only by nuclear actors, is the
prerequisite to a lasting peace founded on the fear of nuclear war
(Berkowitz, 1985: 115). However, this model does not consider the
current relevance of non-state actors and so-called rogue states and
their asymmetrical relationship with the traditional players. One of the
most serious challenges to nuclear deterrence in the Second Nuclear Age
is, in fact, represented by the issue of its applicability to actors
with a different behaviour than the Cold War-era US and USSR (Walton,
2010: 214). These new actors may not conform to a model of rational
behaviour, the latter being a fundamental prerequisite for deterrence to
work. Hence, the major contemporary challenge for nuclear deterrence is
to find ways to adapt itself to actors that may be non-rational: this
means forcing them to assume a rational behaviour. The reduction of the
"nuclear threshold" referred to in the US Nuclear Posture Review can be
read in the light of these facts not as an introduction of flexible
response strategies in nuclear policy, but as an action consistent with
the need for improved deterrence schemes. Being credibility far more
influential than capability as a variable that decides the effectiveness
of a nuclear deterrent (Lowther, 2009: 32), the aggressive policy of
nuclear pre-emption which is discussed in the above said document and in
the US National Military Strategy to combat Weapons of Mass Destruction
(US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2006: 18) can be seen as a
way to make the prospect of nuclear attack more real in the minds of the
potential enemies of the US. Since the nuclear taboo does not apply to
terrorist organisations or rogue states ruled by irrational leaders, the
only way to counter them is acting as if its validity was lost also for
the traditional actors (in this case, the US). The matter is different
with regard to the relationships within the circle of the established
nuclear powers. In this case, nuclear deterrence is based on the schemes
of the Cold War, as the policies of Russia and the US show. In fact, the
current expenditure for nuclear weapons, despite significant cuts, is
still extremely high, as previously mentioned. China has a considerably
inferior arsenal compared to that of the two former superpowers,
sufficient only to assure a policy of "minimal deterrence" (Lieber and
Press, 2006: 8). The concept of minimal nuclear deterrence could be the
most suitable to today's security issues regarding the relations among
declared nuclear armed states, and there are sectors of the public
opinion lobbying for an even greater reduction in the nuclear stockpiles
of the US: among the others, this position is supported by the
Federation of the American Scientists (Kristensen et al., 2009: 21).
Anyway, at the moment the official strategy of the US is oriented
differently, and the same can be said for Russia. While at the beginning
of the First Nuclear Age the US relied on nuclear weapons to
counterbalance Soviet conventional forces, today the situation has
reversed, and Russia keeps an apparently anachronistic large storage of
nuclear weapons to cope with the drastic reductions which took place
after the Cold War in its non-nuclear offensive capabilities. NATO has
stated in its Deterrence and Defence Posture Review that the current
amount of its strategic nuclear weapons is dependent on the reciprocal
level of these weapons on the Russian soil, so it is very unlikely that
there will be drastic reductions, similar to those that occurred at the
end of the Cold War, by the US and its allies in the foreseeable future.
**Nuclear Deterrence of Non-nuclear Attack** [The role of nuclear
deterrence in averting the threat of a conventional attack is currently
proving to be alive especially with regard to non-traditional nuclear
actors, that is, non-declared nuclear powers, states outside the NPT and
states that have violated the terms of the NPT.]{.underline} Countries
in this category have not been attacked militarily in recent times, and
there is some evidence that their nuclear capabilities could have played
a major role in defending them. It is the case of North Korea, a part of
Bush's "axis of evil": her policy towards the development of WMD
programs was far more aggressive than that of Iraq (on her current and
past programs: NTI, 2012), but she has not suffered any attack by the US
nor by any of their local allies. It can be argued that it was her very
progress in the development of WMDs, and especially of nuclear weapons,
that permitted her to avoid an external aggression. Given the
sensitivity of the American public opinion toward the number of
casualties during recent conflicts, it is easy to understand that a
retaliatory strike conducted by an actor facing foreign invasion is
considered as an unacceptable condition by the US. On the other side,
the threat of a nuclear attack should be questioned the survival of the
state apparatus must be considered seriously: in fact, the price to pay
to break the nuclear taboo is high, but certainly lower than that of
regime capitulation: so, these actors gain in credibility what they lack
in capability. [**Nuclear deterrence has a role also in averting
conventional attacks in a regional context. The conflict between India
and Pakistan exemplifies this point: in fact, despite the existence of
sources of tension between the two countries, t**hese actors have not
engaged in major open hostilities since their development of a nuclear
arsenal. **The fear of nuclear escalation may be the explanation for the
restraint of these governments in an area like Kashmir**, where since
the acquisition of nuclear weapons both sides have only supported a
low-intensity conflict (Joeck, 1997: 36).]{.underline} In any case,
nuclear deterrence of non-nuclear attack seems inconsistent with regard
to the traditional nuclear actors. In fact, these have continued to
experience major conventional conflicts (it is, for example, the case of
Russia with Georgia). It is possible that the threat of a nuclear
retaliation lacks credibility when only the aggressor is armed with
nuclear weapons -- as the behaviour of many nuclear powers in time of
war may lead to think -- but this would be hardly true in the case of a
WMD attack. In this respect, the biggest innovations are those developed
by the US within its strategy to combat global terrorism. The same
policy of expanded deterrence which has been discussed above is applied
also to non-nuclear threats, in particular with regard to the scenario
of a terrorist use of WMDs (Huntley, 2006: 49-50). In the National
Military Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction, Washington has
confirmed its willingness to pursue a policy aimed at "dissuading,
deterring and defeating those who seek to harm the US directly \[...\]
especially extremist enemies with weapons of mass destruction" (US
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2006: 9). Nuclear deterrence is
the most likely way to counter terrorism to be used in the future, since
pre-emptive war lacks popular support and has been recognised to be an
excessively expensive strategy. As Trager and Zagorcheva argue, nuclear
deterrence may prove to be an effective method to counter the threat
posed by non-state actors, as long as terrorists' political aims will be
influenceable by states (2005/2006: 88). **Conclusion** **[Nuclear
deterrence is still relevant in dealing with contemporary security
issues.]{.underline}** Although different strategies concerning the use
of nuclear weapons have been proposed in recent times, their application
would be extremely controversial, and for this reason is very unlikely.
[Nuclear deterrence is still an important part of the official strategy
of the US to fight traditional threats, and has been adapted to meet
also today's new security concerns. The other nuclear armed states, the
traditional as well as the non-traditional ones, have shown their
willingness to maintain the nuclear taboo, pursuing in most cases a
minimal deterrence policy.]{.underline} **[The threat of a nuclear
strike can deter both nuclear and non-nuclear attacks]{.underline}**,
the contemporary security scenario requires an evolution of deterrence
rather than a discharge of the concept as a whole. In fact, nuclear
weapons are still among the most powerful and intimidating weapons with
which states can arm themselves, and the stability of a system based on
deterrence still remains attractive, although since the end of the Cold
War maintaining this system has become far more complicated. However,
nuclear deterrence alone cannot be the answer to every security issue in
the contemporary world, and its application needs to be strengthened by
other strategies. [The main role it held during the First Nuclear Age is
lost, but its relevance, although resized, is not.]{.underline}
