#### Space Assets are Capitalist.

As said above, the [[Trump Administration is promoting a sort of
'**space capitalism'**.]{.mark} In fairness, [the notion of '**space
capitalism'**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[was introduced under the Obama
administration]{.underline}]{.mark} and found its first visible
manifestation in the adoption of the [Commercial Space Launch
Competitiveness
Act](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/10357718.2018.1505827)
of 2015. The Act contains a section dedicated to the regulation of space
mining activities that [[aims at promoting the emerging US space]{.mark}
mining [industry]{.mark} [through governmental support]{.mark} and the
protection of rights, including the recognition of property rights over
the extracted space resources under US law (Title IV). [The Trump
administration has endorsed the notion of 'space capitalism' and has
openly voiced its support to US legislative proposals that incorporate
it.]{.mark}]{.underline} In this respect, a draft bill entitled the
American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act assumes particular
relevance. The Act, which has been adopted by the House of
Representatives on 24 April 2018, and is currently under consideration
in the Senate, promotes the deregulation and the easement of licensing
procedures of the previously unregulated 'on-orbit' space activities,
including on-orbit refueling, space resources utilisation, etc., as well
as commercial remote sensing systems. Accordingly, the Act attributes to
the Secretary of Commerce, operating through the Office of Space
Commerce, competence to authorize these activities. In doing so, the
Space Free Commerce Act disregards the recommendation made under the
Obama Administration to confer to the FAA regulatory competence over new
on-orbit activities and takes away from NOAA the competence to regulate
private remote sensing activities.

### Alt Solves AI (communism)

#### Communism stops AI from controlling the economy

most prominent legal scholars, spoke at the Berggruen Institute's China
Center workshop on artificial intelligence in March in Beijing,

beijing---[[The **most** **momentous** **challenge** facing
socio-economic systems]{.mark} today [is]{.mark} the arrival of
[a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence. [If AI remains under the
**control of market forces**, it will]{.mark} inexorably [result in a
**super-rich oligopoly of data billionaires** who reap the wealth
created by robots that displace human labor, leaving massive
unemployment in their wake.]{.mark}]{.underline}

But China's socialist market economy could provide a solution to this.
[[If **AI**]{.mark} rationally [**allocates** **resources** through big
data analysis]{.mark},]{.underline} and if robust feedback loops can
supplant [[the]{.mark} [imperfections of "**the invisible
hand**"]{.mark} while fairly sharing the vast wealth it [creates, a
**planned economy** that actually works could]{.mark} at last [be
**achievable.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The more AI advances into a general-purpose technology that permeates
every corner of life, [[the less sense it makes]{.mark} to allow [it to
remain in **private hands** that serve]{.mark} the [interests of]{.mark}
the [few instead of]{.mark} the [many.]{.mark}]{.underline} More than
anything else, [[the **inevitability of mass unemployment** and the
demand **for universal welfare** will drive]{.mark} the idea of
[**socializing**]{.mark} or **nationalizing**
[**AI**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Marx's dictum, "[**[From each according to their abilities, to each
according to their needs]{.mark}**," [needs an update]{.mark} for the
21st century: "[**From the inability of an AI economy to provide jobs
and a living wage for all, to each according to their
needs.**"]{.mark}]{.underline}

Even at this early stage, the idea that digital capitalism will somehow
make social welfare a priority has already proven to be a fairytale[.
[The **billionaires** of Google and Apple]{.mark},]{.underline} who have
been depositing company profits in offshore havens to avoid taxation[,
[are hardly paragons of **social
responsibility**]{.underline}]{.mark}[**.** The ongoing scandal around
[Facebook's business model]{.mark}, which [puts **profitability above
responsible citizenship**]{.mark}, is yet another example of how [**in
digital capitalism, private companies** only look after their own
interests at the **expense** of the rest **of
society.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

One can readily see where this is all headed once technological
unemployment accelerates. "Our responsibility is to our shareholders[,"
[the robot **owners** will **say**. "We are **n**]{.mark}**o[t]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}an **employment agency** or a
**[charity]{.mark}**."]{.underline}
