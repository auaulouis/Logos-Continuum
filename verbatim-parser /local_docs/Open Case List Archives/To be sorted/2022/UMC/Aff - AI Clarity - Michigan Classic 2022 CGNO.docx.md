# AI Clarity

## Notes

Special Thanks to Ezra Gearheart, Evelyn Alsop, Isa Harrison, Ella
Flores, Edward Mu, Alper Guvenen, Anna Yang, Annabelle Durbin, Rebecca
Chan, Charles Harrington, Aaron Kinsley, and Jun Kwon for all their hard
work and contributions.

The idea behind this aff is that the US would cooperate with NATO on
increasing clarity and transparency of AI and AI regulations- that could
mean a variety of things. Info sharing between militaries, discussion
and decision making around clarity on the legal and ethical frameworks
of military AI.

The first advantage argues that a creation of a clarity doctrine is
what's needed in order to win the tech race with china and create an
alternative to digital authoritarianism.

The basic spillover mechanism is trust- once transparency is created and
set as a social norm, it would get through some of the roadblocks in AI
development and innovation which accesses the second advantage.

The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the world will extend far
beyond narrow national security applications. The [development of AI
constitutes a new pillar of strategic competition, and it heightens the
competition in existing pillars. The nation with the most resilient and
productive economic base will be best positioned to seize the mantle of
world leadership. That base increasingly depends on the strength of the
innovation economy, which in turn will depend on AI. AI technologies
will drive waves of advancement in critical infrastructure, commerce,
transportation, health, education, financial markets, food production,
and environmental sustainability. The race to research, develop, and
deploy AI and associated technologies is already intensifying strategic
competition.]{.underline} [The U.S. government must embrace the AI
competition and organize to win it.]{.underline} The American approach
to innovation, which has served the country well for decades, must be
recalibrated to account for the centrality of the competition involving
AI and associated technologies to the emerging U.S.-China rivalry. [[To
retain its innovation leadership and position in the world,]{.mark} the
United States needs a stronger government-led technology strategy [that
integrates]{.mark} promotion and [protection policies]{.mark} and links
investments [in AI to a larger constellation of related emerging
technologies]{.mark}.]{.underline} This chapter articulates the nature
of the AI competition and the two prerequisites for winning it:
organizing for technology competition under White House leadership and
establishing the principles for continued cooperation with competitors.
The following chapters (10--16) enumerate the core elements of an
integrated strategy and prescribe actions to ensure the United States
wins the AI competition and sets the foundation to win the broader
technology competition. It is foremost an affirmative agenda for growing
and recruiting talent, promoting a diverse AI innovation ecosystem, and
investing in the R&D to [harness AI and associated technologies to build
a healthier, more prosperous, and secure society.]{.underline}
Protection of research, intellectual property (IP), and investments will
be necessary to complement the effort to invigorate AI competitiveness
at home and build a coalition of like-minded partners in the world. [The
U.S.-China AI Competition Is Serious and Complex. The leading indexes
that measure progress in AI development generally place the United
States ahead of China.2 However[, **the gap is closing
quickly.**]{.mark} China stands a reasonable chance of overtaking the
United States as the leading center of AI innovation in the coming
decade]{.underline}.3 In recent years, [technology firms in China have
produced pathfinding advances in natural language processing,4 facial
recognition technology,5 and other AI-enabled domains. China's
businesses, investors, technologists, and academics are integral to
global AI development. China's social media and e-commerce companies
compete for users around the world. Its telecoms build global 5G
infrastructure. Its venture capitalists and large technology firms
invest huge sums in new startups.6 Its leading AI companies have
research labs in the United States7 and elsewhere.8 Its researchers
produce a trove of respected AI papers that advance the field.9 None of
this would concern us from a national security perspective, except for
the fact that China is led by a **single-party authoritarian regime**
that **threatens American interests**.]{.underline} [China has moved
more quickly and with more determination than the United
States]{.underline}, guided by a constellation of AI plans for
government ministries, universities, and companies.10 These strategic
documents reflect [Beijing's view that advances in AI will fundamentally
reshape military and economic competition in the coming
decades.11]{.underline} China has backed up its strategic plans with
significant state subsidies to technology firms and academic
institutions that engage in cutting-edge AI research.12 China preserves
its capital by taking advantage of basic research done by the West so
that it can focus more on applications. It pours significant sums of
money into research and talent in relevant fields,13 and it promotes
"national champion" companies to win markets abroad.14 [Through its
military-civil fusion programs, China has sought to integrate advances
in AI from the commercial and academic worlds into military power.15
Using espionage, technology transfer programs, and targeted investment,
Beijing seeks to acquire sensitive IP and data from the United States
and other countries. The U.S.-China competition is complicated by the
complex web of supply chains, research partnerships, and business
relationships that link the world's two AI leaders]{.underline}.
Dramatic steps to sever these ties could be costly for Americans and
reverberate across the world. The relationships between American and
Chinese academics, innovators, and markets are deep, often mutually
beneficial, and help advance the field of AI.17 Moreover, [it remains in
the U.S. national interest to leverage formal diplomatic dialogue about
AI and other emerging technologies and to explore areas for cooperative
AI projects]{.underline} that will benefit humanity.[  The United States
can compete against China without ending collaborative AI research and
severing all technology commerce. Broad-based technological decoupling
with China could deprive U.S. universities and companies of scarce AI
and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) talent,18
sever American companies' efficient supply chains,19 and cut off access
to markets and capital for innovative firms.20 Instead, the United
States should conceive of targeted disentanglement as just one element
of its overall approach, which, if applied judiciously to key sectors,
can help build U.S. technological resilience, reduce threats from
illicit technology transfer, and protect national security--critical
sectors.]{.underline}

#### (Tech race scenario)

#### AI is a crucial component of the US-China tech race---without a clear and transparent model of digital governance to oppose digital authoritarianism the US will lose the tech race and the world will fall to digital authoritarianism

Justin **Sherman**, 20**19** (WIRED, Washington Post, The Atlantic, New
America geopolitics contributor; New America; Chapter 3 "Why U.S.-China
AI Competition Matters","Essay: Reframing the U.S.-China AI "Arms Race";
https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/reports/essay-reframing-the-us-china-ai-arms-race/why-us-china-ai-competition-matters//EF)

Competing AI development in the United States and**e** China needs to be
reframed from the AI arms race rhetoric, but that doesn't mean
[AI]{.underline} development itself doesn't matter. In fact, the
opposite is true. [We are in an era of great power competition, and U.S.
policymakers must pay greater attention to artificial intelligence
development domestically and in China,]{.underline} primarily for two
reasons. First, [artificial intelligence will have a **profound impact
on state power**,]{.underline} mainly through economic growth and
enhanced military capability. Second, [global **leaders in AI will set
norms** around its use---and around the use of technology in society
writ large---which will have **important influence**]{.underline} on
[other **"undecided" states and the future international
order**.]{.underline} This is why [American policymakers should focus on
engaging with China on AI projects without giving up critical expertise
or technologies that could potentially enhance harmful applications of
artificial intelligence]{.underline}, whether they are in governance,
business, or the military. An Era of Great Power Competition We are
entering an era of great power competition, characterized by "struggle,
change, competition, the use of force, and the organization of national
resources to enhance state power." Industrial productivity, science, and
technology are critical in this struggle as well, notes international
relations scholar Paul Kennedy.41 Indeed, that seems to be the case.
Amidst a heap of articles on the death of the liberal world
order,42 there is also much concern in the American national security
arena around China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea---what political
scientist Amy Zegart refers to as the "big four" due to their various
elements of state power and the threat vectors they present (nuclear
risks, cyber risks, territorial aggression against U.S. allies, and
disruption of the international order).43 The great power competition
that Paul Kennedy identified from the twentieth century is back in full
force.44 [Artificial Intelligence and State Power Artificial
intelligence is poised to contribute greatly to bolstering a developed
nation's economy. Accenture Research and Frontier Economics predict,
based on research in 12 developed countries, that AI could "double
annual economic growth rates" in 2035 while also increasing labor
productivity by up to 40 percent.]{.underline}49 McKinsey Global
Institute predicts AI may deliver \$13 trillion in global economic
activity by 2030.50 PricewaterhouseCoopers puts that figure even higher
at up to \$15.7 trillion in global GDP growth by 2030, much of which
will be due to productivity increases.51 These estimates are varied, but
they all rightfully predict enormous economic growth due to an explosion
in AI uses worldwide.52 However, these gains will not be evenly spread.
As research from McKinsey Global Institute articulates, "leaders of AI
adoption (mostly in developed countries) could increase their lead over
developing countries," and "[leading AI countries could capture an
additional 20 to 25 percent in net economic benefits, compared with
today,]{.underline} while developing countries might capture only about
5 to 15 percent."53 W[ith the United States and China already
representing the largest economies in the world, **maximizing uses of
AI** within either nation could **lead to massive gains in state power**
and **influence** on the global stage.]{.underline} "After all," writes
political scientist Michael Horowitz, "[countries cannot maintain
military superiority over the medium to long term without an underlying
economic basis]{.underline} for that power."54 Further, there is in part
a question of pure economic power: If Chinese companies don't
just *develop* better but *also use* that AI more profitably than
American firms, China benefits economically and by extension has more
resources to build state power generally. [That the United States
currently has significant AI talent does not mean an American edge in AI
development is decisive and everlasting.]{.underline} Militarily
speaking, [**a**rtificial **i**ntelligence is also **revolutionary for
state military powe**r]{.underline}. The People's Liberation Army (PLA)
in China views AI as a revolutionary factor in military power and
civil-military fusion,55 just as the U.S. [Department of Defense has
similarly recognized how advances in artificial intelligence "will
change society and, ultimately, the character of
war."]{.underline}56[ China is investing in this future. The PLA has
already funded a number of AI military]{.underline} projects as part of
its 13th Five-Year Plan, spanning command decision-making, equipment
systems, robotics, autonomous operating guidance and control systems,
advanced computing, and intelligent unmanned weapon systems.57 In 2017,
[President Xi Jinping called for the military to accelerate AI research
in preparation for the future of war.]{.underline}58 There has even been
a report of the Beijing Institute of Technology recruiting high-talent
teenagers for a new AI weapons development program.59 The [**Chinese
government** is undoubtedly **preparing to maximize its AI development**
in the service of maximizing its military power]{.underline}. That the
[United States current]{.underline}ly has significant [AI talent does
not mean an American edge in AI development is decisive and
everlasting.]{.underline} The United States has started to do the same,
in some respects: It has established a Defense Innovation Board for
ethics of AI in war,60 as well as a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center
to develop "standards....tools, shared data, reusable technology,
processes, and expertise" in coordination with industry, academia, and
American allies.61 DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,
currently has 25 programs in place focused on artificial intelligence
research, and in September 2018, its director announced a plan to spend
up to \$2 billion over the next five years on more AI work.62 But there
is still much to be done, as I'll address in the last section. Even
within the U.S. military's approaches to artificial intelligence, as one
West Point scholar notes, "the military is facing some hard questions
about how it will adapt its culture and institutions to exploit new
technologies---and civilians face a tough job ensuring they answer them
effectively."63 There are certainly military leaders aware of this
fact---in announcing the \$2 billion in AI funding, DARPA's director
depicted it "as a new effort to make such systems more trusted and
accepted by military commanders"64---yet the road ahead will have its
challenges. [In general, the U.S. defense apparatus' willingness to
**engage in cultural and operational shifts** will greatly influence how
successfully AI is integrated into the United States
military]{.underline}. [It's also important to note that China's
government and its private companies will likely be less constrained by
ethical and legal norms when developing AI than will their American
counterparts]{.underline}.65 Faster deployment of and greater
experimentation with AI may result, even though this may lead to perhaps
chaotic or more unpredictable deployments of artificial
intelligence---or, perhaps, plainly unethical uses of AI. This leads
into the second main reason why U.S.-China AI competition still matters.
Artificial Intelligence and Global Technology Norms [**A**rtificial
**i**ntelligence is increasingly **enabling authoritarian governance**
around the world.]{.underline} Many commentators have [referred
to]{.underline} this [as "digital authoritarianism]{.underline},"66 by
which technologies like [AI---deployed at scale to, say, bolster
citywide facial recognition---enable or enhance authoritarian principles
of state governance. Chinese companies have been complicit---and at
times instrumental---in the diffusion of]{.underline} the technology and
[practices that enable]{.underline} this [authoritarian
governance]{.underline}. While Western companies sometimes export
surveillance technology to dictators as well, most democratic
governments take steps to prevent it through export controls, such as
those established in the Wassenaar Arrangement.67

Artificial intelligence is increasingly enabling authoritarian
governance around the world. Chinese firms have exported facial
recognition systems to governments in Singapore, the United Arab
Emirates, Zimbabwe, and Malaysia. Broader categories of surveillance
technology---from national identity cards to biometric sensors, internet
monitoring software, and more---are also exported by Chinese companies
to governments in Ethiopia, Ecuador, South Africa, Bolivia, Egypt,
Rwanda, and Saudi Arabia.68 [In addition to enabling insidious social
control and large-scale human rights abuses, such spread of surveillance
technology---which includes AI---consolidates power in the hands of
governments that are hostile]{.underline}, or typically align with
powers hostile, to American interests.69 [Democracy is under attack
around the world,]{.underline}70 and [authoritarian uses of AI further
harm democratic norms and the state of democracy globally.]{.underline}
This is especially true for the many countries who remain undecided in
their use and regulation of technologies like artificial intelligence.
[This is an obvious strategic problem for U.S. policymakers, especially
as Beijing has already sought to become a global leader in technology
norms through an assortment of proposals at the likes of the United
Nations]{.underline}71 and through channels such as
IEEE.72 Unsurprisingly, this [interest has already been reflected with
respect to artificial intelligence]{.underline}. The China Electronics
Standardization Institute, involved in standard-setting under China's
Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, released a white paper
in January 2018 on a framework for AI standardization.73 In April 2018,
Chinese organizations hosted a major international AI standards meeting
in Beijing.74 Similar to how China is proactive in trying to set global
norms around the internet, it is also intent on setting global standards
and norms around artificial intelligence and its use in society.75 As
Jeffrey Ding, Paul Triolo, and Samm Sacks explain, "realizing that
China's many large companies are increasingly global players, and
Chinese-developed AI algorithms will have effects on users outside of
China, China's government aims to advance global efforts to set
standards around ethical and social issues related to AI algorithm
deployment. Should Chinese officials and experts succeed in influencing
such standards and related AI governance discussions, the policy
landscape may skew toward the interests of government-driven technical
organizations, attenuating the voices of independent civil society
actors that inform the debate in North America and Europe."76 This may
very well become a greater trend---[as China's government and private
industry develop increasingly sophisticated AI applications---that lends
even further global influence to China alongside bigger economic
advantage.]{.underline} It's not just through diplomats, trade
negotiators, and military officers that the Chinese or American
government will exercise influence in areas of competition between the
two countries (most obviously Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin
America). [Without a clear, viable model of digital governance to oppose
digital authoritarianism, the United States stands to lose political
influence]{.underline} over a number of countries in these areas. This,
too, w[ill significantly impact great power competition, potentially in
ways that diminish the relative importance of military power. The
Chinese government, in this larger process of global norm-setting on
uses of contemporary technologies, is attempting to remake the world in
its image. This is why U.S. policymakers desperately need to reframe
their thinking on AI competition.]{.underline}

#### Authoritarian governments like China don't have the capacity for complete totalitarianism right now but current development of Authoritarian AI will change that---The US is key to a democratic pushback to avoid global mind control and widespread explosive success of authoritarian empires-

There is also a third way in which [AI promises to reshape the world. By
allowing governments to monitor, understand, and control their
citizens]{.underline} far more closely than ever before, [AI will offer
authoritarian countries a plausible alternative to liberal
democracy]{.underline}, the first since the end of the Cold War. [That
will spark **renewed international competition** between social
systems]{.underline}. For decades, most [political theorists have
believed that]{.underline} liberal democracy offers the only path to
sustained economic success. [Either governments could repress their
people and remain poor or liberate them and reap the economic
benefits]{.underline}. [Some repressive countries managed to grow their
economies for a time, but in the long run authoritarianism always meant
stagnation. AI promises to upend that dichotomy]{.underline}. It [offers
a plausible way for big, economically advanced countries to make their
citizens rich while maintaining control over them]{.underline}. Some
countries are already moving in this direction. [China has begun to
construct a digital authoritarian state by using surveillance and
machine learning tools to control restive populations, and by creating
what it calls a "social credit system]{.underline}." Several like-minded
countries have begun to buy or emulate Chinese systems. Just as
competition between liberal democratic, fascist, and communist social
systems defined much of the twentieth century, so [**the struggle
between liberal democracy and digital authoritarianism** is set to
define the twenty-first]{.underline}. [New technologies will **enable
high levels of social control at a reasonable cost.** Governments will
be able selectively censor topics and behaviors to allow information for
economically productive activities to flow freely, while curbing
political discussions that might damage the regime]{.underline}.
[China's so-called Great Firewall provides an early demonstration of
this kind of selective censorship.]{.underline} [As well as
retroactively censoring speech, AI and big data will allow **predictive
control** of potential dissenters.]{.underline} This will resemble
Amazon or Google's [consumer targeting but will be much more effective,
as]{.underline} [authoritarian governments will be able to draw on data
in ways that are not allowed in liberal democracies]{.underline}. Amazon
and Google have access only to data from some accounts and devices; an
AI designed for social control will draw data from the multiplicity of
devices someone interacts with during their daily life. [And even more
important, authoritarian regimes will have no compunction about
combining such data with information from tax returns, medical records,
criminal records, sexual-health clinics, bank statements, genetic
screenings, physical information]{.underline} (such as location,
biometrics, and CCTV monitoring using facial recognition software), and
information gleaned from family and friends. AI is as good as the data
it has access to. Unfortunately, [the quantity and quality of data
available to governments on every citizen will prove excellent for
training AI systems.]{.underline} [Even the mere existence of this kind
of predictive control will help authoritarians. Self-censorship was
perhaps the East German Stasi's most important disciplinary mechanism.
**AI will make the tactic dramatically more effective.** People will
know that the omnipresent monitoring of their physical and digital
activities will be used to predict undesired behavior, even actions they
are merely contemplating]{.underline}. From a technical perspective,
such predictions are no different from using AI health-care systems to
predict diseases in seemingly healthy people before their symptoms show.
[In order to prevent the system from making negative predictions, many
people will begin to mimic the behaviors of a "responsible" member of
society]{.underline}. These may be as subtle as how long one's eyes look
at different elements on a phone screen. [This will improve social
control not only by **forcing people to act in certain ways,** but
**also by changing the way they think.**]{.underline} [A central finding
in the cognitive science of influence is that making people perform
behaviors can change their attitudes and **lead to self-reinforcing
habits**]{.underline}. [Making people expound a position makes them more
likely to support it, a technique used by the Chinese on U.S. prisoners
of war during the Korean War.]{.underline} Salespeople know that getting
a potential customer to perform small behaviors can change attitudes to
later, bigger requests. [More than 60 years of laboratory and fieldwork
have shown humans' remarkable capacity to rationalize their
behaviors.]{.underline} As well as more effective control, AI also
promises better central economic planning. As Jack Ma, the founder of
the Chinese tech titan Alibaba, argues, with enough information, central
authorities can direct the economy by planning and predicting market
forces. Rather than slow, inflexible, one-size-fits-all plans, AI
promises rapid and detailed responses to customers' needs. [There's no
guarantee that this kind of digital authoritarianism will work in the
long run, but it may not need to, as long as it is a plausible model for
which some countries can aim. That will be enough to **spark a new
ideological competition.** If governments start to see **digital
authoritarianism as a viable alternative to liberal democracy**, they
will feel no pressure to liberalize.]{.underline} Even if the model
fails in the end, attempts to implement it could last for a long time.
Communist and fascist models collapsed only after thorough attempts to
implement them failed in the real world. CREATING AND EXPORTING AN
ALL-SEEING STATE No matter how useful a system of social control might
prove to a regime, building one would not be easy. Big IT projects are
notoriously hard to pull off. They require high levels of coordination,
generous funding, and plenty of expertise. For a sense of whether such a
system is feasible, it's worth looking to China, the most important
non-Western country that might build one. China has proved that it can
deliver huge, society-spanning IT projects, such as the Great Firewall.
It also has the funding to build major new systems. Last year, the
country's internal security budget was at least \$196 billion, a 12
percent increase from 2016. Much of the jump was probably driven by the
need for new big data platforms. China also has expertise in AI.
[Chinese companies are global leaders in AI research and Chinese
software engineers often beat their American counterparts in
international competitions.]{.underline} Finally, technologies, such as
[smartphones, that are already widespread can form the backbone of a
personal monitoring system. Smartphone ownership rates in China are
nearing those in the West and in some areas, such as mobile payments,
China is the world leader. China is already building the core components
of a digital authoritarian system. The Great Firewall is sophisticated
and well established, and it has tightened over the past
year.]{.underline} [Freedom House, a think tank, rates **China the
world's worst abuser of Internet freedom**]{.underline}. China is
implementing extensive surveillance in the physical world, as well. In
2014, it announced a social credit scheme, which will compute an
integrated grade that reflects the quality of every citizen's conduct,
as understood by the government. The [development of China's
surveillance state has gone furthest in Xinjiang Province, where it is
being used to monitor and control the Muslim Uighur
population.]{.underline} [Those whom the system deems unsafe are shut
out of everyday life; many are even sent to reeducation
centers.]{.underline} If Beijing wants, it could roll out the system
nationwide. To be sure, ability is not the same as intention. [But China
seems to be moving toward authoritarianism and away from any suggestion
of liberalization. The government clearly believes that AI and big data
will do much to enable this new direction.]{.underline} China's 2017 AI
Development Plan describes how the ability to predict and "grasp group
cognition" means ["AI brings new opportunities for social construction."
Digital authoritarianism is not confined to China. Beijing is exporting
its model.The Great Firewall approach to the Internet has spread to
Thailand and Vietnam.]{.underline} According to news reports, Chinese
experts have provided support for government censors in Sri Lanka and
supplied surveillance or censorship equipment to Ethiopia, Iran, Russia,
Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Earlier this year, the Chinese AI firm Yitu sold
"wearable cameras with artificial intelligence-powered
facial-recognition technology" to Malaysian law enforcement. More
broadly, [China and Russia have pushed back against the U.S. conception
of a free, borderless, and global Internet. China uses its diplomatic
and market power to influence global technical standards and normalize
the idea that domestic governments should control the Internet in ways
that sharply limit individual freedom.]{.underline} After [reportedly
heated competition for influence over a new forum that will set
international standards for AI, **the United States** secured the
secretariat, which helps **guide the group's decisions**,]{.underline}
while Beijing hosted its first meeting, this April, and Wael Diab, a
senior director at Huawei, secured the chairmanship of the committee. To
the governments that employ them, these measures may seem
defensive---necessary to ensure domestic control---but other governments
may perceive them as tantamount to attacks on their way of life. THE
DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE [The rise of an authoritarian technological model of
governance could, perhaps counterintuitively, rejuvenate liberal
democracies. How liberal democracies respond to AI's challenges and
opportunities depends partly on how they deal with them
internally]{.underline} and partly on how they deal with the
authoritarian alternative externally. In both cases, [grounds exist for
guarded optimism.]{.underline} Internally, although [established
democracies will need to make concerted efforts to manage the rise of
new technologies]{.underline}, the challenges aren't obviously greater
than those democracies have overcome before. One big reason for optimism
is path dependence. Countries with strong traditions of individual
liberty will likely go in one direction with new technology; those
without them will likely go another. Strong forces within U.S. society
have long pushed back against domestic government mass surveillance
programs, albeit with variable success. In the early years of this
century, for example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
began to construct "Total Information Awareness" domestic surveillance
systems to bring together medical, financial, physical and other data.
Opposition from media and civil liberties groups led Congress to defund
the program, although it left some workarounds hidden from the public at
the time. Most citizens in liberal democracies acknowledge the need for
espionage abroad and domestic counterterrorism surveillance, but
powerful checks and balances constrain the state's security apparatus.
Those checks and balances are under attack today and need fortification,
but this will be more a repeat of past efforts than a fundamentally new
challenge. In the West, governments are not the only ones to pose a
threat to individual freedoms. Oligopolistic technology companies are
concentrating power by gobbling up competitors and lobbying governments
to enact favorable regulations. Yet societies have overcome this
challenge before, after past technological revolutions. Think of U.S.
President Theodore Roosevelt's trust-busting, AT&T's breakup in the
1980s, and the limits that regulators put on Microsoft during the
Internet's rise in the 1990s. Digital giants are also hurting media
diversity and support for public interest content as well as creating a
Wild West in political advertising. But previously radical new
technologies, such as radio and television, posed similar problems and
societies rose to the challenge. In the end, regulation will likely
catch up with the new definitions of "media" and "publisher" created by
the Internet. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg resisted labeling
political advertising in the same way as is required on television,
until political pressure forced his hand last year. Liberal democracies
are unlikely to be won over to digital authoritarianism. Recent polling
suggests that a declining proportion in Western societies view democracy
as "essential," but this is a long way from a genuine weakening of
Western democracy. [The external challenge of a new authoritarian
competitor may perhaps strengthen liberal democracies.]{.underline} The
human tendency to frame competition in us versus them terms may lead
Western countries to define their attitudes to censorship and
surveillance at least partly in opposition to the new competition. [Most
people find the nitty-gritty of data policy boring and pay little
attention to the risks of surveillance. But **when these issues underpin
a dystopian regime in the real world** they will prove neither boring
nor abstract. **Governments** and technology firms in liberal
democracies **will have to explain how they are
different.**]{.underline} LESSONS FOR THE WEST The West can do very
little to change the trajectory of a country as capable and confident as
China. Digital authoritarian states will likely be around for a while.
To compete with them, [liberal democracies will need clear
strategies]{.underline}. First, governments and societies should
rigorously limit domestic surveillance and manipulation. Technology
giants should be broken up and regulated. Governments need to ensure a
diverse, healthy media environment, for instance by ensuring that
overmighty gatekeepers such as Facebook do not reduce media plurality;
funding public service broadcasting; and updating the regulations
covering political advertising to fit the online world. They should
enact laws preventing technology firms from exploiting other sources of
personal data, such as medical records, on their customers and should
radically curtail data collection from across the multiplicity of
platforms with which people come into contact. Even governments should
be banned from using such data except in a few circumstances, such as
counterterrorism operations. Second, [Western countries should work to
influence how states that are neither solidly democratic nor solidly
authoritarian implement AI and big data systems. They should provide aid
to develop states' physical and regulatory infrastructure and use the
access provided by that aid to prevent governments from using joined-up
data. They should promote international norms that respect individual
privacy as well as state sovereignty. And they should demarcate the use
of AI and metadata for legitimate national security purposes from its
use in suppressing human rights.]{.underline} Finally, [Western
countries must prepare to push back against the digital authoritarian

#### Digital authoritarianism leads to a global suffering worse than extinction

Di **Minardi**, October 15, 20**20**, a graduate of Boston College where
she majored in Political Science and minored in International Studies
now works in communications at Georgia Tech, "The grim fate that could
be 'worse than extinction'",
<https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201014-totalitarian-world-in-chains-artificial-intelligence>

When we think of existential risks, events like nuclear war or asteroid
impacts often come to mind. Yet there's one future threat that is less
well known -- and while it doesn't involve the extinction of our
species, it could be just as bad. It's called [[the]{.mark} "[world in
chains]{.mark}" scenario]{.underline}, where, like the preceding thought
experiment, [[a global totalitarian government uses a novel technology
to lock a majority of the world into perpetual
suffering]{.mark}.]{.underline} If it sounds grim, you'd be right. But
is it likely? Researchers and philosophers are beginning to ponder how
it might come about -- and, more importantly, what we can do to avoid
it. Existential risks (x-risks) are disastrous because they lock
humanity into a single fate, like the permanent collapse of civilisation
or the extinction of our species. These catastrophes can have natural
causes, like an asteroid impact or a supervolcano, or be human-made from
sources like nuclear war or climate change. Allowing one to happen would
be "an abject end to the human story\" and would let down the hundreds
of generations that came before us, says Haydn Belfield, academic
project manager at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the
University of Cambridge. Toby Ord, a senior research fellow at the
Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) at Oxford University, believes that
the odds of an existential catastrophe happening this century from
natural causes are less than one in 2,000, because humans have survived
for 2,000 centuries without one. However, when he adds the probability
of human-made disasters, Ord believes the chances increase to a
startling one in six. He refers to this century as "the precipice"
because the risk of losing our future has never been so high.
[Researchers at the Center on Long-Term Risk, a non-profit research
institute in London, have expanded upon x-risks with the
even-more-chilling prospect of suffering risks. [These "s-risks"
are]{.mark} defined as "[suffering]{.mark} on an astronomical scale[,
vastly exceeding all suffering that has existed on Earth so
far]{.mark}." In these scenarios, life continues for billions of people,
but [the quality is so low and the outlook so bleak that dying out would
be preferable]{.mark}. In short: a future with negative value is worse
than one with no value at all.]{.underline} This is where the "world in
chains" scenario comes in. [If a malevolent group or government suddenly
gained world-dominating power through technology, and there was nothing
to stand in its way, it could lead to an extended period of abject
suffering and subjugation]{.underline}. A 2017 report on existential
risks from the Global Priorities Project, in conjunction with FHI and
the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, warned that "[[a long
future under a particularly brutal global totalitarian state]{.mark}
could arguably be [worse than]{.mark} complete
[extinction]{.mark}".]{.underline} Singleton hypothesis Though global
totalitarianism is still a niche topic of study, [researchers in the
field of existential risk are increasingly turning their attention to
[its most likely cause: a]{.mark}rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence.]{.underline} In his "singleton hypothesis", Nick
Bostrom, director at Oxford's FHI, has explained how a global government
could form with AI or other powerful technologies -- and why it might be
impossible to overthrow. He writes that [a world with "a single
decision-making agency at the highest level" could occur if that agency
"obtains a decisive lead through a technological breakthrough in
artificial intelligence]{.underline} or molecular nanotechnology".
[[Once in charge, it would control advances in technology that prevent
internal challenges, like surveillance or autonomous weapons,
and,]{.mark} with this monopoly, [remain perpetually
stable]{.mark}.]{.underline} If the singleton is totalitarian, life
would be bleak. Even in the countries with the strictest regimes, news
leaks in and out from other countries and people can escape. [A global
totalitarian rule would eliminate even these small seeds of hope. To be
[worse than extinction]{.mark}, "that would [mean we feel absolutely no
freedom, no privacy, no hope of escaping, no agency to control our lives
at all\"]{.mark},]{.underline} says Tucker Davey, a writer at the Future
of Life Institute in Massachusetts, which focuses on existential risk
research. "[In totalitarian regimes of the past, \[there was\] so much
paranoia and psychological suffering because you just have no idea if
you\'re going to get killed for saying the wrong thing,"]{.underline} he
continues. "And now imagine that there\'s not even a question, every
single thing you say is being reported and being analysed." "We may not
yet have the technologies to do this," Ord said in a recent interview,
"but it looks like the kinds of technologies we're developing make that
easier and easier. And it seems plausible that this may become possible
at some time in the next 100 years." AI and authoritarianism Though life
under a global totalitarian government is still an unlikely and
far-future scenario, [AI is already enabling authoritarianism in some
countries]{.underline} and strengthening infrastructure that could be
seized by an opportunistic despot in others. "We\'ve seen sort of a
reckoning with the shift from very utopian visions of what technology
might bring to much more sobering realities that are, in some respects,
already quite dystopian," says Elsa Kania, an adjunct senior fellow at
the Center for New American Security, a bipartisan non-profit that
develops national security and defence policies. [[In the past,
surveillance required hundreds of]{.mark} thousands of [people]{.mark}
-- one in every 100 citizens in East Germany was an informant -- [but
now it can be done by technology.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the United
States, the National Security Agency (NSA) collected hundreds of
millions of American call and text records before they stopped domestic
surveillance in 2019, and there are an estimated four to six million
CCTV cameras across the United Kingdom. Eighteen of the 20 most
surveilled cities in the world are in China, but London is the third.
The difference between them lies less in the tech that the countries
employ and more in how they use it. What if the definition of what is
illegal in the US and the UK expanded to include criticising the
government or practising certain religions? The infrastructure is
already in place to enforce it, and AI -- which the NSA has already
begun experimenting with -- would enable agencies to search through our
data faster than ever before. In addition to enhancing surveillance[,
[AI also underpins the growth of online misinformation, which is another
tool of the authoritarian.]{.mark} AI-powered [deep fakes]{.mark}, which
can [spread fabricated political messages]{.mark}, and algorithmic
micro-targeting on social media are making propaganda more persuasive.
[This undermines our epistemic security]{.mark}]{.underline} -- the
ability to determine what is true and act on it -- that democracies
depend on. "Over the last few years, we\'ve seen the rise of filter
bubbles and people getting shunted by various algorithms into believing
various conspiracy theories, or even if they're not conspiracy theories,
into believing only parts of the truth," says Belfield. "You can imagine
things getting much worse, especially with deep fakes and things like
that, until it\'s increasingly harder for us to, as a society, decide
these are the facts of the matter, this is what we have to do about it,
and then take collective action."

The hard truth is that [a world that is **less free** is one that is
**less**]{.underline} secure, **[stable]{.underline}** and prosperous.
[The **greatest dangers** to the American way of life emanate from
**hostile autocracies**]{.underline}. There are no quick fixes, but
[[the **best antidotes** to]{.underline}]{.mark} the challenges of
[**[great-power conflict]{.mark}**, **[terrori]{.mark}sm** [and **mass

in]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[building]{.underline}** of inclusive
**[[democratic institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- and working with
allied democracies to sustain the free and open order that China, in
particular, wishes to replace with a world that's safe for autocracy.
The conventional wisdom that authoritarianism has popular momentum is
wrong. No one anywhere is taking to the street to demand more corrupt
governance, the adoption of one-man rule, a stronger surveillance state,
or greater intervention by malign foreign powers. [Democratic freedoms
are]{.underline} unquestionably [under assault in many
nations]{.underline}. Autocrats are aggressive precisely because of the
growing demands for change in their more modern, connected societies ---
and the rising risk that middle classes in nations such as China and
Russia will not be willing forever to forfeit political rights for
prosperity. [[American]{.underline}]{.mark} retrenchment and
[[isolationism **compound the danger**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It would be
nice to live in a world where failed states and dictatorships were a
problem for someone else to worry about. But rather than producing
stability, [[Western retreat]{.underline}]{.mark} only [**[emboldens
autocrats]{.mark}** in ways that **amplify dangers** to American
national security.]{.underline} We know that [violent [extremism
**flourishes** under]{.mark}]{.underline} state failure and
**[[dictatorship]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Broken states become breeding
grounds for extremist groups because they leave vacuums that terrorists
are only too happy to fill. [In nations without **democratic
accountability**, citizens become drawn to the only forms of expression
available to them, which are often **violent** and
**extreme**.]{.underline} The good news is that we have billions of
allies around the world: citizens on every continent chafing for greater
freedom and dignity. They do not want U.S. military-led nation-building.
They want peaceful support for their independent efforts to create
democratic space in systems distorted by overweening government control,
dangerous governance gaps and foreign malign influence. [The free world
**cannot be neutral** in the face of **autocracy's
resurgence**]{.underline}. Rather, it should play to its strengths. The
appeal of democratic opportunity is a strategic asset for the United
States --- despite our own shortcomings --- because people around the
world similarly aspire to live in societies that guarantee justice,
rights and dignity. [America's **closest allies are democracies**.
[Democracies **don't fight each other**, **export**]{.mark} **violent

#### Democratic backsliding leads to [nuke war]{.underline} and [threat-multiplication]{.underline}

**Kendall-Taylor 19**, Senior Fellow and Director of the Transatlantic
Security Program at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS)
(Andrea, February 26^th^, "Autocracy's Advance and Democracy's Decline:
National Security Implications of the Rise of Authoritarianism Around

accessed 7/21/19)

The growing prevalence of personalized
[[autocracies]{.underline}]{.mark} is cause for concern because they
tend to [produce the worst outcomes of any type of political regime:
they tend to [produce the most risky and aggressive]{.mark} foreign
[policies]{.mark}; the [most]{.mark} [likely to invest in nuclear
weapon]{.mark}s]{.underline};7 [the **[most likely to fight
wars]{.mark}**]{.underline} [against democracies]{.underline};8
[[and]{.mark} the **most likely to [initiate]{.mark} interstate
[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}.9 [As the **adventurism**]{.underline}
[of Iraq's Saddam Hussein, Uganda's Idi Amin, and North Korea's Kim
Jong-un suggests, a **[lack of accountability]{.mark} often [translates
into]{.mark} an ability to take [risks]{.mark}** that other dictatorial
systems simply cannot afford]{.underline}.

[[Russia underscores the link between rising personalism and
**aggression**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Although Putin's actions in Crimea
and Syria were designed to advance a number of key Russian goals, it is
also likely that Putin's lack of domestic constraints increased the
level of risk he was willing to accept in pursuit of those
goals]{.underline}. Putin's tight control over the media ensures that
the public receives only the official narrative of foreign events.
Limited access to outside information makes it difficult for Russians to
access unbiased accounts of the goings-on in the rest of the world and
gauge Putin's success in the foreign policy arena. Putin's elimination
of competing voices within his regime further ensures that he faces
minimal accountability for his foreign policy actions.

[Politics in **China** show many of these same trends. Xi's
**increasingly aggressive posture in the South China Sea**]{.underline}
[has occurred alongside the rising personalization of the political
system. Xi has amassed substantial personal power since coming to office
in 2012 and continues to roll back the norms of the post-Mao collective
leadership system. [If Xi further consolidates]{.mark} control and
limits accountability---particularly over military and foreign policy
bodies---research suggests that [he]{.mark}, too, [could]{.mark} feel
free to **further [escalate]{.mark} his aggressive rhetoric and actions
[in the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea**]{.underline}.

[Not only do personalist dictatorships pursue aggressive foreign
policies---they are also often **difficult and unpredictable
partners**]{.underline}. [Research underscores that, thanks to [limited
constraints]{.mark} on decisionmaking, personalist leaders generally
[have]{.mark} the **latitude to [change their minds on a
whim]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[producing **volatile**]{.mark} and
erratic [policies]{.mark}]{.underline}.10 [Moreover, personalist
leaders---think Putin, Bolivian President Evo Morales, and Venezuelan
President Nicolás Maduro---are among those [autocrats]{.mark} who are
most **suspicious of U.S. intentions**]{.underline} [and who [see the
**creation of an external enemy**]{.mark} [as an effective means of
boosting public support]{.mark}]{.underline}. Anti-U.S. rhetoric,
therefore, is most pronounced in personalist settings.

#### AI clarity framework with NATO is fundamental to building international trust- that's key to making broader multilateral cooperation possible

**Hill 20** (Steven Hill\* Affiliation: The author served until February
2020 as Legal Adviser and Director of the Office of Legal Affairs (OLA)
at the NATO International Staff in Brussels and , 4-27-2020, accessed on

Law \| Cambridge Core\",

[It is useful to complement this description of NATO\'s fairly nascent
policy work on military applications of AI]{.underline} with a brief
overview of the types of applications that one hears most discussed in
NATO circles. Given the amount of academic, media, and political
attention to the issue of lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS), it
might come as a surprise that it is the far less high-profile or
headline-grabbing applications of AI that receive attention within NATO.
This may well be because LAWS are already being discussed by a Group of
Governmental Experts within the Geneva-based framework of the Convention
on Certain Conventional Weapons, thus making Allies hesitant to
duplicate discussions in Brussels. However, the reason that the issue of
LAWS---however important the debates involved---is not on the forefront
of the agenda at NATO is likely more straightforward: [that current and
foreseeable technology suggests different, perhaps more prosaic
applications, for AI in the military sphere. This essay focuses on two:
(1) intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR]{.underline})[;
and (2) cyber defense]{.underline}. The development and use of
AI-enabled applications in each of these areas clearly presents both
opportunities and challenges. Enhancing the information available to
support decision-making is one of NATO\'s priorities. [ISR is based on
information-gathering from a variety of assets deployed across domains.
**The information or data gathered from both NATO and national assets
can then be fused together to help identify patterns and trends in
support of situational awareness and operational decision-making.**
Since this data will likely be too voluminous for traditional human
analysis, NATO can leverage AI-enabled systems]{.underline} to comb
through these datasets[. **In this way, NATO can apply AI to enhance
situational awareness and improve decision-making, a potentially
considerable advantage given the challenges of getting all Allies up to
speed on rapidly evolving situations**. AI applications can also be used
in the context of cyber defens]{.underline}e, where [NATO has a
defensive mandate focused on defending NATO\'s networks and supporting
Allies as they defend their own networks. AI-based applications cover
areas such as preemptive patching and the taking of corrective action on
the basis of a constant analysis of low-level and recurrent patterns of
attacks and cyber threats across networks, all done more quickly and
with greater precision.]{.underline} Moreover, the more information
exchanged on the nature of attacks in a variety of networks, the easier
it is to identify trends in multinational cyber threats. [While the use
of **AI in both these contexts could potentially increase the speed and
quality of multinational military cooperation**, it clearly also can
pose difficulties. For example, increasing speed could be perceived as
fueling pressure for inappropriately accelerated action. This kind of
acceleration of usual processes might be perceived as going against
"normal" NATO decision-making in a number of ways: it might be seen as
evading the political control exercised by the North Atlantic Council,
overriding the consensus decision-making that applied within the
Alliance, being susceptible to misinterpretation or being seen as
escalatory in nature, or otherwise leading to unpredictable
results.]{.underline} In an extreme case, Allies [might see these
situations as inconsistent with NATO\'s collective defense mandate.
**This might result in a backlash against the use of AI-enabled military
applications, precisely at a time when the Alliance needs to maintain an
edge with them**.]{.underline} In other words, as with many issues
involved in multinational military cooperation, [the problem may
ultimately boil down to one of **trust**.]{.underline} As [noted above,
the different national strategies refer to the need for legal and
ethical frameworks. They also generally refer to the desirability of
multilateral cooperation on AI. The limited work within NATO so far has
also pointed to a willingness to take on these issues in a multinational
setting. However, the reality is that these discussions have not yet
taken off.]{.underline} There may be good reasons for this, including
the ongoing nature of LAWS discussions in Geneva or the understandable
reluctance---frequently encountered with respect to new
technologies---to take positions that could constrain innovation or that
could present a strategic disadvantage to those who abide by the rules.
At the same time[, the perception that there are unresolved legal or
ethical issues hovering over military applications of AI clearly poses a
risk to the use of this technology, including in a multilateral military
setting. There is generally broad agreement among NATO allies that
existing international law should apply to the military use of new
technologies, including AI. **However, a perception of lack of clarity
on the rules of the game may lead to a lack of trust that might hamper
multinational cooperation**. In this regard, dialogue about legal and
ethical frameworks can be an important means of building
trust.]{.underline} Individual NATO Allies are in the midst of
developing their own national strategies for military applications of
AI. As noted above, while these strategies use some of the same
vocabulary in calling for more clarity on the legal and ethical
frameworks of military AI, there is a real risk of a lack of meeting of
the minds about the substantive content of these frameworks.

#### Multilateral cooperation key to solving a plethora of multidimensional existential risks- climate change, disease, overfishing, space conflict, nuclear armament, and war- its an impact filter

2014 to November 2021 and leader of the Social Democratic Party from

in a new era of risk") 2 June 2022
https://www.sipri.org/commentary/essay/2022/we-must-strengthen-multilateralism-new-era-risk

[Even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, it was all too
apparent that global governance was not dealing well with the most
important contemporary challenges. The outcomes of COP
26]{.underline}---the Conference of Parties to the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change, held in Glasgow in November 2021---[fell
far short of what was
needed](https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/2021-11/2021-11-15-COP26-what-happened-summary-Aberg-et-al_1.pdf),
even if they exceeded many observers' low expectations. The conference's
achievements included accelerating the process of making national
commitments more ambitious[. But the collective pledges would not keep
the global average temperature rise below the 'desirable' **1.5°C
limit**]{.underline} [set six years earlier in the Paris
Agreement,]{.underline} and probably not below the 2°C limit viewed as
essential. [The response to the **Covid-19 pandemic** also highlighted
key weaknesses]{.underline}---as well as the strengths---[of global
governance and cooperation]{.underline}. The rapid development of
effective vaccines was an outstanding example of successful cooperation.
[But the **distribution of vaccines** was plagued with logistical
problems and 'vaccine nationalism'. Two thirds of the world's ocean
surface---the so-called areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ)---is
being ravaged by unsustainable and **illegal fishing and pollution from
shipping and mineral extraction.**]{.underline} But the [institutions
and agreements that focus on the ABNJ tend to have narrow mandates,
making it hard to address threats to this important global
commons.]{.underline} The [legal framework governing the use of outer
space is similarly unfit for purpose]{.underline}. Mostly dating from
the 1960s and 1970s, it does not regulate the activities of private
companies and includes no enforcement mechanisms. [Nor does it provide
any clarity about how to prevent or even manage the militarization of
outer space, or instruments for handling disputes.]{.underline} And
[progress on nuclear disarmament has stalled]{.underline} during the
last decade and much of the arms control architecture since the cold war
has collapsed[. The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty]{.underline}
(New START) from 2010 [is now the only agreement left that sets any
verifiable limits on the size and composition of the Russian and United
States nuclear arsenals,]{.underline} while the Conference on
Disarmament has long been stagnant as a negotiating body. The body
entrusted with the maintenance of international peace and security, [the
**UN Security Council**, was shown to be **powerless in the face of the
invasion of Ukraine**,]{.underline} [as a consequence of Russia's veto
power.]{.underline} [Russia also blocked, last year, a resolution that
would have recognized climate-related security risks as core Security
Council business.]{.underline} In short, the [instruments and
**institutions of international governance are badly in need of** a
makeover and **a revivified spirit of cooperation**.]{.underline} We
have no choice but to address these deficiencies. As the Environment of
Peace report emphasizes, the twin environmental and security crises have
brought us into a new era of risk to human security. [In this new era,
many of the **problems** we face **are non-linear: they are
multi-dimensional;** they have multiple stakeholders;]{.underline} they
have multiple causes; they have multiple symptoms; they have multiple
solutions; [and they are constantly evolving. **We need global
governance** fit **to address these kinds of risk**, and to deliver on
three key tasks:]{.underline} The first is [managing the consequences of
climate change and environmental challenges,]{.underline} both those
that are already here and those that are probably inevitable over the
coming years because of the environmental damage we have already done.
The second is [tackling the root causes of those environmental problems
to stop them getting worse. Because those root causes so often lie in
human economic activities, we need to effect a far-reaching green
transition---]{.underline}not just decarbonizing energy and transport
systems[, but also how we produce food, how we manage natural resources
and how we manage waste.]{.underline} We must make sure we do not create
new risks to peace and justice in the process. [And third, we must
ensure that the steps we take to build peace and security are sensitive
to the risks from, and potential impacts on, the natural
environment]{.underline}. All of [these tasks require collective action
both at and between different scales---local, national, regional,
global]{.underline}---and within and between different
spheres---communities, youth, civil society, public services,
government, intergovernmental mechanisms, and the finance and business
sectors. This **[collective action]{.underline}**, in turn, [**requires
the rebuilding of trust**,]{.underline} a new social contract, and the
means to negotiate a viable bargain between different participants to
balance their interests in the most productive way. This is true for
relations between states and for relations between community groups. But
how do we go about creating this new contract and strengthening
collaborative global governance? One of the headline recommendations of
the Environment of Peace report is to be 'deliberately inclusive'.
[**Inclusivity broadens the base of knowledge available** when creating
or adapting policies. It can help in understanding the nature of the
problems policies are meant to address, as well as the context. It can
also help to identify possible solutions, who could implement them, and
what unintended knock-on impacts---including on peace and security---the
policy might have.]{.underline} And [when these different groups know
that their perspectives and their interests have been taken into
account, it creates legitimacy for the policy, unity of purpose and
political trust. These in turn improve the chances of a successful
outcome and build political trust that makes even more ambitious
policies possible]{.underline} in the future. [Healthy democratic
governance]{.underline} and a strong civil society [are vital to this
process.]{.underline} Inclusivity is as important between states as
between communities, even if it inevitably takes different forms.
[Between states, it means that **nations large and small have a seat at
the table** in discussions that affect them.]{.underline} [Inclusivity
also means actors from outside the worlds of government and diplomacy
can participate **meaningfully in multilateral exchanges**]{.underline}.
One of the questions that the High-level Advisory Board on Effective
Multilateralism will explore is how to make sure that youth, women,
Indigenous Peoples and other traditionally sidelined groups are included
and can influence what is happening. Non-linear problems demand
joined-up policymaking and implementation that is coordinated between
the traditional policy areas and sectors. This requires breaking out of
siloed thinking. It requires dialogue. And for that to happen, the
different policy areas and sectors need to speak each other's language.
Specialization needs to be balanced with breadth of knowledge. This is
an area where substantial progress has already been made. The UN
Security Council has held several discussions on climate security.
Several governments have, like Sweden's, pushed for climate security to
become more systematically included in the Security Council agenda. The
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) includes
environmental cooperation within its comprehensive approach to security.
Its 2008 Madrid Declaration on Environment and Security explicitly
recognized the OSCE's role in addressing security risks related to
climate change and other environmental challenges within its region, and
in 2021 the OSCE passed a decision at the highest political level on
'strengthening co-operation to address the challenges caused by climate
change'. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP)---a key part of the legacy
of the 1972 Stockholm Conference---has conducted various projects on the
security implications of climate change for well over a decade. In 2018,
the UN formally established the Climate Security Mechanism (CSM), which
provides integrated climate risk assessments to the Security Council and
other UN bodies. [As we push further into this new era of risk, we need
more initiatives like this, and stronger, broader mandates. Another area
where multilateral cooperation must improve is finance. Huge sums are
needed over the coming years to increase resilience to climate change
and other environmental hazards, to reverse environmental decline and to
build peace.]{.underline} The principle is firmly established that
richer countries should provide climate finance and technical assistance
to poorer countries for this purpose. This is not only about global
solidarity but also a recognition that richer countries have, by and
large, had the biggest historical carbon footprints and enjoyed the
greatest benefits from fossil-fuelled industrialization. Yet there is a
worrying tendency for big funding pledges to be broken, whether it is
for disaster relief, post-conflict reconstruction or climate finance. At
the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, rich countries pledged to provide
US\$100 billion of climate finance annually to developing countries by
2020. By 2021, they were still an estimated \$20 billion short of the
target---arguably far more. It is also worth noting that when it comes
to resilience building, the most fragile states have the clearest need;
yet per person, they receive only around one eightieth of the climate
financing that flows to non-fragile states. [Trust is an essential
foundation for cooperation]{.underline}. One key way to build trust at
the multilateral level would be for rich countries to quickly and fully
meet their international funding obligations on climate change,
biodiversity and other environmental issues. [Reliable data and improved
transparency could play a big role in multilateral action to deal with
the twin crises.]{.underline} It is hard to predict the scale and timing
of today's environmental and security risks, partly because they are
often generated by combinations of factors originating in different
parts of the world. Shared global or regional banks of accurate,
up-to-date data could improve our ability to spot emergent risks and
prepare for them, or even stop them materializing. [Advances in
monitoring, data processing and modelling could help communities,
governments and businesses to plan and invest more

#### AI clarity reduces existential nuclear risk- multilateral military coop is key

**Boulanin et al. 20** (vincent, PhD in Political Science from École des
Hautes en Sciences Sociales, lora saalman, petr topychkanov, fei su, moa

NUCLEAR RISK") June 2020
https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2020-06/artificial_intelligence_strategic_stability_and_nuclear_risk.pdf

Existing nuclear risk-reduction measures The fact that many of the risks
and strategic challenges posed by AI are not fundamentally new means
that [policy options to mitigate the impact of AI on nuclear risk
already exist]{.underline}. [In fact, a number of existing policy
options for nuclear risk reduction could have a positive effect on the
strategic relations of nuclear armed states and could help to reduce
nuclear risk. These include]{.underline} no-first-use policies,
commitments to lower the alert status of nuclear arsenals[**,
transparency and information sharing**, and cooperation.]{.underline}
No-first-use policy [One of the most effective means to prevent the
nuclear escalation scenarios described in chapter 4 would be if all
nuclear-armed states adopted a clear]{.underline} NFU
[policy.]{.underline} Currently, China and India are the only
nuclear-armed states that have such a policy. Although universal
adoption of NFU policies would not necessarily alleviate all the
signalling problems generated by the introduction of AI in nuclear
weapon systems, from the authors' perspective it would be positive for
strategic stability if all nuclear-armed states, particularly Russia and
the USA, were to make such a commitment. Some participants in the SIPRI
workshops---notably from Russia and the USA---did not share this view.
[Indeed, in the current geopolitical context, it is highly unlikely that
these two states, as well as the USA's NATO partners France and the UK,
would seriously consider that possibility. The USA in particular is
constrained from official adoption of NFU by its alliance structures and
the views of its allies in both East Asia and Europe]{.underline}.491
The likelihood of Russia and the USA adopting NFU policies is further
compromised by both official and non-official statements from China and
India about the longer-term status and nature of their NFU
commitments.492 A commitment to lower the alert status of nuclear
arsenals Removing strategic weapons from a launch-on-warning or
launch-ready alert status would allow more time for decision makers to
make appropriate assessments. India, Pakistan and China have the lowest
level of alert as their nuclear warhead and delivery vehicles are
reportedly kept separate.493 It would take at least a few days for them
to launch a nuclear strike (although this is changing as they develop
the sea legs of their nuclear triads).494 [In contrast, Russia and the
USA have their systems on high alert, which means that they are much
more likely to use nuclear weapons by accident or deliberately in a
crisis or from the outset of a conflict]{.underline}. It would be highly
positive for international security if Russia and the USA were to
de-alert their nuclear weapons----although this would not be a panacea
without proper training, data integrity and cybersecurity systems in
place. In the current context, this also seems to be an unrealistic
possibility. Nevertheless, there is reason to hope that this possibility
could be part of future bilateral nuclear riskreduction measures between
these two countries, as well as between them and other nuclear-armed
states. [Transparency and information sharing A traditional approach to
**transparency and information sharing could also help in risk
reduction.** AI is a kind of technology that is prone to
misunderstanding for two principal reasons. First, there remains
widespread misconceptions about what AI is and what it can or could do.
Second, it is difficult for states to assess in a tangible way each
other's progress in this area]{.underline}. It is, for instance,
impossible for a state to assess whether an opponent's air defence
systems rely on traditional hard-coded programming or an algorithm
trained by machine learning if that information has not already been
disclosed by the opponent itself. [There are a number of
transparency-centred CBMs that states could implement voluntarily and
unilaterally or as a result of bilateral or multilateral
dialogue.]{.underline} These can be grouped in three categories: (a)
AI-specific measures, (b) [measures related to the **military use of
AI,** and]{.underline} (c) measures related to the use of AI in
connection with nuclear weapons and deterrence. AI-specific measures.
[One AI-specific measure would be for a state to **make publicly
available** official documents that outline its general strategy and
policy on AI. If a state has not yet adopted a national policy or
strategy on AI, then it could **adopt one to clarify its intention and
views**. Another AI-specific measure would be to make publicly available
governmental recommendations]{.underline} (e.g. guidelines, procedures
and techniques) about testing and verification and about cybersecurity
in the field of AI.

#### The US and NATO are key

**Everstine 20** -- Brian W. Everstine served as Air Force Magazine's
Pentagon editor, where he reported on US military operations, the Air
Force's presence abroad, among others. (Jan. 15, \"DOD AI Leader Wants
Closer Collaboration With NATO\", 1-15-2020, Air Force Magazine,
<https://www.airforcemag.com/dod-ai-leader-wants-closer-collaboration-with-nato/)//Alk>

[**NATO allies need to join the US in developing artificial intelligence
capabilities to gain an upper hand over China and Russia**, which are
working together on AI in ways that threaten shared Western values, the
military's top AI expert said]{.underline} Jan. 15. Lt. Gen. Jack
Shanahan, the director of the Pentagon's Joint Artificial Intelligence
Center, said that [while the US is moving forward on AI as a military
initiative, some NATO allies are progressing slower]{.underline} because
ethical debates have "immobilized" some countries. "[Success with AI
adoption requires a multi-generational commitment]{.underline} with the
right combination of tactical urgency and strategic patience," Shanahan
told reporters on a call from Brussels, where he is meeting with NATO
officials. "The US, along with our NATO allies, will face difficult
decisions regarding the future of legacy systems and platforms in an era
where technological innovations are transforming every aspect of the
human experience." [The threats are clear from China and Russia in the
realm of AI]{.underline}, Shanahan said. For example, [China is using it
for censorship, stifling freedom of expression, facilitating the sale of
AI-enabled weapons, "and lowering the barrier of entry of potential
adversaries and potentially placing this technology in the hands of
non-state actors." Most concerning is China forcing its companies like
Huawei to cooperate with Chinese Communist Party
intelligence]{.underline}, "no matter where the company operates," he
said. [Russia has shown a "greater willingness to disregard
international ethical norms" and develop systems that could destabilize
international security]{.underline}, he added. [That includes using
automation and machine learning to power global disinformation campaigns
as well as lethal weapons systems]{.underline}, Shanahan said. Much of
AI software comes from commercial industry and is easily exported, so
"we have serious concerns about nonstate actors and their ability to
grab these capabilities from the open-source market," Shanahan said.
While other technologies are developed by the military and then spun off
in the commercial world, AI is moving in the opposite direction. "When
you do that, those technologies will be available to almost anyone with
not a lot of effort to go get them," he said. "[That risks a future
which destabilizes the international order in the digital
age]{.underline}, so I will tell you that we're looking carefully about
how we would prevent proliferation of those capabilities. But I will not
pretend that we can do that easily or immediately." One example Shanahan
touched on is the expansion of "deepfake" technology, where AI and
machine learning can produce video that looks and sounds realistic
enough to convincingly portray a world leader. [Deepfakes could worsen
the "corrosive influence" of disinformation campaigns in political
elections, such as Russia's attempt to influence the 2016 US
presidential race, Shanahan argued.]{.underline} ["What if a senior
leader were to come on and announce that the nation is at war, but it
was a deepfake?"]{.underline} he said. "Those are areas that are of
increasing concern across all of society, not just the United States
military, but they could be used anywhere across the world. They're not
hard to get access to either[." Authoritarian regimes can also deploy AI
for ubiquitous social surveillance and facial recognition, he added.
Shanahan believes these issues should compel the US and NATO to
"vigorously promote AI for our shared values." "The deliberate actions
we take in the coming years with responsible **AI adoption will ensure
our militaries keep pace with digital modernization and remain
interoperable in the most complex and consequential missions, so that we
can continue to rely on the security architecture that has preserved
peace, prosperity, and stability** in Europe and beyond for
decades]{.underline}," he said.

[When governments incorporate artificial intelligence into decision
making, the results can be good.]{.underline} Governments have, for
instance, deployed AI-based systems effectively to manage hospital
capacity, regulate traffic, and determine the best way to distribute
social benefits and deliver services. [However, some government AI
systems have unfairly or unwittingly targeted or disadvantaged specific
portions of their constituencies---and worse. A major difference between
systems that work and those that fail is the way in which they are
created and overseen.]{.underline} An approach that leads to successful
outcomes includes proper governance, thoughtfully conceived processes
based on input from affected stakeholders**[, and transparency about
AI's role in decision making.]{.underline}** We call such a
comprehensive approach Responsible AI. To achieve it, governments must
empower leadership and use AI to enhance human decision making---not
replace it. [A Responsible AI approach should include regular reviews,
integration with standard tools and data models, and a plan for
potential lapses.]{.underline} Governments have another powerful tool at
their disposal. They can use procurement to promote widespread adoption
of Responsible AI. By making adherence to Responsible AI principles a
prerequisite for bidding on public-sector AI contracts, agencies can
ensure that the systems they create are ethical and
[transparent,]{.underline} while gradually integrating AI into
public-sector decision making. **UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF GOVERNMENT
AI SYSTEMS** [In the recent past, several well-publicized lapses have
illustrated the unintentional harm that can befall individuals or
society when government AI systems aren't designed, built, or
implemented in a responsible manner.]{.underline} **A major difference
between AI systems that work and those that fail is the way in which
they are created and overseen.** After college entrance exams were
canceled because of the pandemic, the UK government used an algorithm
that determined grades based on students' past performance. The system
[reduced the grades of nearly 40% of
students](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/world/europe/uk-england-grading-algorithm.html)
and led to accusations that it was biased against test takers from
challenging socioeconomic backgrounds. [A Dutch court ordered the
government to [stop using a system based on an **undisclosed**
algorithm](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/blackbox-welfare-fraud-detection-system-breaches-human-rights-dutch-court-rules/)]{.underline}---which
was intended to predict whether people would commit benefits or tax
fraud---[after it was determined that the system breached human rights
laws and the EU's General Data Protection Regulation]{.underline}.
Citizens groups initiated the legal action after discovering that **[the
system had been used to target neighborhoods with mostly low-income and
minority residents.]{.underline}** A local NGO [sued Buenos Aires for
**[violating child
rights]{.underline}**](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/09/1009992/live-facial-recognition-is-tracking-kids-suspected-of-crime/)
after the city adopted a facial-recognition system to find criminal
suspects. The system relied on a database that contained information
about children as young as four. A US border control agency deployed a
biometric scanning application built on machine-learning systems from
multiple vendors. [When it was [unable to explain failure
rates](https://www-cdn.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ACUS-AI-Report.pdf)
because of the proprietary nature of the technology, concerns arose
about the agency's accountability and procurement
practices.]{.underline} These lapses and others like them have led to
widespread criticism and legal action. In the US, concerns over
algorithmic-based decision systems in health care, criminal justice,
education, employment, and other areas have resulted in lawsuits.
[Lapses have also led to organized efforts to track "bad actor" vendors
and enact policies or laws to limit the use of public-sector AI systems
or, at a minimum, make them **more transparent**.]{.underline} A 2020 UK
parliamentary committee report on AI and public standards found that
government and public-sector agencies are failing to be as open as they
should be about AI use. The report called on the government to uphold
new transparency standards and create effective oversight processes to
mitigate risks. **[[When lapses occur in government AI systems, trust in
public institutions is eroded. Over time, such a disconnect can damage
government legitimacy and citizens']{.mark} [belief in and support for
governmental authority in general]{.mark}.]{.underline}** According to
BCG research, when people have a positive experience with online
public-service delivery, it strengthens their trust in government. But
when they have a negative experience, it has a disproportionately
detrimental effect on trust. [If governments' deployment of AI is to
earn citizens' trust, they need to get it right. Responsible AI will
**foster** both **trust** and the ongoing license that governments need
in order to use machine learning to improve their own
perform]{.underline}ance.

#### Racist AI exacerbates policy brutality and inequality 

**Bailey et al., 20** (Jane Bailey, Jacquelyn Burkell, and Valerie
Steeves , 9-2-2020, accessed on 7-20-2022, RSC College of New Scholars,

Predictive policing uses algorithmic processing of historical data to
predict when and where new crimes are likely to occur, assigns police
resources accordingly and embeds enhanced police surveillance into
communities, usually in lower-income and racialized neighbourhoods.
**[This increases the chances that any criminal activity --- including
less serious criminal activity that might otherwise prompt no police
response --- will be detected and punished, ultimately limiting the life
chances of the people who live within that environment.]{.underline}**
And the evidence of inequities in other sectors continues to mount.
Hundreds of students in the United Kingdom protested on Aug. 16 against
the disastrous results of Ofqual, a flawed algorithm the U.K. government
used to determine which students would qualify for university. In 2019,
[Facebook's microtargeting ad service helped dozens of public and
private sector employers exclude people from receiving job ads on the
basis of age and gender. Research conducted by ProPublica has documented
race-based price discrimination for online products. **And search
engines regularly produce racist and sexist results.**]{.underline}
**[These outcomes matter because they perpetuate and deepen pre-existing
inequalities based on characteristics like race, gender and
age]{.underline}**. [They also matter because they deeply affect how we
come to know ourselves and the world around us, sometimes by
pre-selecting the information we receive in ways that reinforce
stereotypical perceptions.]{.underline} Even technology companies
themselves acknowledge the urgency of stopping algorithms from
perpetuating discrimination. To date the success of ad hoc
investigations, conducted by the tech companies themselves, has been
inconsistent[. Occasionally, corporations involved in producing
discriminatory systems withdraw them from the market, such as when
Clearview AI announced it would no longer offer facial recognition
technology in Canada. But often such decisions result from regulatory
scrutiny or public outcry only after members of equality-seeking
communities have already been harmed]{.underline}. It's time to give our
regulatory institutions the tools they need to address the problem.
Simple privacy protections that hinge on obtaining individual consent to
enable data to be captured and repurposed by companies cannot be
separated from the discriminatory outcomes of that use. [This is
especially true in an era when most of us (including technology
companies themselves) cannot fully understand what algorithms do or why
they produce specific results.]{.underline}

**Trust in the government creates government efficacy, causes econ
growth, climate regs, vaccine rates, infrastructure, better crisis
response, and solves populism.**

[Trust in government has been identified as one of the most important
foundations upon which the legitimacy and sustainability of political
systems are built. Trust is essential for social cohesion and well-being
as it affects governments' ability to govern and enables them to act
without having to resort to coercion]{.underline}. Consequently, it is
an efficient means of lowering transaction costs in any social, economic
and political relationship (Fukuyama, 1995**[). A high level of trust in
government might increase the efficiency and effectiveness of government
operations]{.underline}**. 1. TRUST IN GOVERNMENT, POLICY EFFECTIVENESS
AND THE GOVERNANCE AGENDA 22 GOVERNMENT AT A GLANCE 2013 © OECD 2013
[Core levels of trust in government are necessary for the fair and
effective functioning of government institutions -- such as adherence to
the rule of law, or the delivery of basic public services and the
provision of infrastructure]{.underline}. The rule of law and
independent judiciary are particularly important as their proper
functioning is a key driver of trust in government, as established in
several studies (Knack and Zak, 2003; Johnston, Krahn and Harrison,
2006; Blind, 2007**[). As well-functioning government institutions
matter for business investment decisions, trust in them is a necessary
ingredient to spur economic growth]{.underline}** (Dasgupta, 2009; Algan
and Cuha, 2013). [Trust in government institutions at the same time
influences individual behaviour in ways that could support desired
policy outcomes. This may range from rather narrowly defined policies
and programmes (**such as participation in vaccination campaigns)** to
broader policy reforms (e.g. **environmental regulation or pension
reform**]{.underline}). [Trust is important because many public
programmes create the opportunity for free riding and opportunistic
behaviour. Trust could reduce the risk of such behaviour to the extent
that people are prepared to sacrifice some immediate benefits if they
have positive expectations of the longer-term outcome of public
policies, either at a personal level (pensions) or by contributing to
the common good (redistribution of income through
taxation).]{.underline} Trust in government may help governments to
implement structural reforms with long term benefits. Many reforms
involve sacrificing short-term satisfaction for longer-term gains and
will require broader social and political consensus to be effective and
sustainable. [In a high-trust environment, such reforms may not only be
properly enacted and implemented, but could be sustained long enough to
bear their fruits**. This extends the time frame for policy decisions.**
In a low-trust climate, citizen will prioritise immediate, appropriable
and partial benefits, and will induce politicians to seek short-term and
opportunistic gains through free-riding and **populist
attitudes**]{.underline} (Gyorffy, 2013). Trust in government could
improve compliance with rules and regulations and reduce the cost of
enforcement. [Rules and regulations are never perfect or complete enough
to eliminate abuse. Their effectiveness depends on the extent to which
people see them as fair and legitimate enough to outweigh the benefits
of non-compliance.]{.underline} This is particularly important for
regulations where the gap between the cost of compliance and personal
benefits is large and where control is more difficult. Taxation is an
example of the first, while traffic regulations are an example of the
second. Trust in the regulator can lead to higher voluntary compliance
(Murphy, 2004). Trust in government institutions could help to increase
confidence in the economy by facilitating economic decisions, such as on
investment and consumption that foster economic growth. [Trust in
institutions as well as interpersonal trust may reduce the perception of
risks linked to decisions ranging from the consumption of durables to
job mobility, worker hiring and investment. An increase in trust among
people raises total factor productivity, therefore fosters economic
progress]{.underline} (Dasgupta, 2009). [This, in turn, supports
economic growth and extends the planning horizon of economic agents,
increasing economic dynamism. Trust in government seems to be especially
critical in crisis situations, such as natural disasters, economic
crisis or political unrest which focuses attention on the core functions
of public governance]{.underline}. The capacity of governments to manage
crises and to implement successful exit strategies is often a condition
for their survival and for their re-election. [In the aftermath of major
disasters, lack of trust may hamper emergency and recovery]{.underline}
GOVERNMENT AT A GLANCE 2013 © OECD 2013 23 1. TRUST IN GOVERNMENT,
POLICY EFFECTIVENESS AND THE GOVERNANCE AGENDA procedures causing great
harm to society and damaging government's capacity to act. Likewise, the
current economic crisis may reveal dimensions of trust that were not
evident in the gradual evolution of countries in the years that preceded
it. Trust may run in different directions. It is not only trust of
citizens and organisations in government that matters for policy
effectiveness; trust of government in citizens and organisations and
trust within government may shape policy design and its outcomes
(Bouckaert, 2012). How much citizens and businesses are trusted by
government is reflected in how government functions and how public
services are organised as well as their efficiency and effectiveness --
e.g. the tax system, the use of self-regulation and self-monitoring. In
addition, citizens' and businesses' trust in government and governments'
trust in citizens and businesses feed off one another. An open and
responsive government is an enabling environment to reinforce trust
between government and citizens in both directions. Unfortunately, trust
from and within government is considerably less documented in the
literature than trust in government. **[While trust takes time to be
established, it can be lost quickly. It is not sufficient to discuss the
impact of trust in government on the performance of government, the
economy and society, it is also necessary to describe what might happen
if there is an increasing distrust in governmen]{.underline}**t. This
might lead to less willingness on the part of citizens (and businesses)
to obey the law, to make sacrifices during crises or to pay taxes. [This
could raise costs for government -- resulting in declining efficiency --
or erode revenues. Declining trust in government might also make it more
difficult to attract and retain talent to work for government
institutions.]{.underline}

#### Given the preponderance of possible [existential events]{.underline}, it is important to focus on creating [effective governance]{.underline} broadly that [reduces cumulative risk]{.underline}

[**[Confronting]{.mark}** the **[Limits of Our
Knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline} A common theme across these emerging
technologies and emerging risks is that a [[tremendous level of]{.mark}
scientific [uncertainty]{.mark} and expert **[disagreement]{.mark}
typically [exists]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is particularly the case
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} future **[[scientific]{.underline}]{.mark}**
progress and [[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}, the ways in which
advances in one domain may influence progress in others, [[and]{.mark}
the likely [global]{.mark} **[impacts and risks]{.mark}** of projected
advances]{.underline}. Active topics of research at CSER include how to
obtain useful information from a range of experts with differing views,
and how to make meaningful scientific progress on challenges where we
have discontinuous data, or few case studies to draw on, or even when we
must characterize an entirely unprecedented event. [**[This might be
a]{.mark}** hypothesized ecological **[tipping
point]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which when passed would result in an
irreversible march toward the collapse of an entire critical ecosystem.
[[Or it might be a]{.underline}]{.mark} transformative [scientific
[breakthrough]{.mark}]{.underline} such as the development of artificial
general intelligence, where we only have current trends in AI
capability, hardware, and expert views on the key unsolved problems in
the field to draw insight from[. It is [**unrealistic to expect that
we** can]{.mark} always, or even for the most part, [be
right]{.mark}.]{.underline} We need to have humility, [to expect false
positives, and to be able to [identify]{.mark} priority [research
targets from]{.mark} among many **[weak signals.]{.mark}**
[Recognizing]{.mark}]{.underline} that there are
[[limits]{.underline}]{.mark} to the level of detail and certainty that
can be achieved[, this work [is]{.mark} often [combined with]{.mark}
work on [general]{.mark} principles of [scientific]{.mark} and
**[technological governance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, work
under the heading of "[[responsible innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}"
focuses on the challenge of developing collective stewardship of
progress in science and technology in the present, [with a view [to
**achieving good future outcomes**]{.mark}]{.underline}.21 This combines
scientific foresight with processes to involve the key stakeholders at
the appropriate stages of a technology's development. At different
stages these [[stakeholders]{.underline}]{.mark} will
[[include]{.underline}]{.mark}: scientists involved in fundamental
research and applied research; [[industry leaders]{.underline}]{.mark};
researchers working on the risks, benefits, and other impacts of a
technology; funders; policymakers; regulators; NGOs and focus groups;
and **[[laypeople]{.underline}]{.mark}** who will use or be [[affected
by the]{.underline}]{.mark} development of a
[[technology]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the case of technologies with a
potential role in global catastrophic risk, the entire global population
holds a stake. Therefore decisions with long-term consequences must not
rest solely with a small group of people, represent only the values of a
small subset of people, or fail to account for the likely impacts on the
global population. There have been a number of [[very
encouraging]{.mark} specific [examples of]{.mark} such foresight and
[collaboration]{.mark}]{.underline}, where scientific domain
specialists, interdisciplinary experts, funders, and others have worked
together to try to guide an emerging technology's development, establish
ethical norms and safety practices, and explore its potential uses and
misuses in a scientifically rigorous way. In bioengineering, the famous
[**1975 Asilomar conference** on recombinant DNA established important
precedents]{.underline}, and more recently [summits have been held on
advances such as human gene editin]{.underline}g. In artificial
intelligence, a number of important conferences have been held recently,
with enthusiastic participation from academic and industry research
leaders in AI alongside interdisciplinary experts and policymakers. A
number of the world's leading AI research teams have established ethical
advisory panels to inform and guide their scientific practices, and a
[cross-industry "partnership on AI to benefit people and society"
involving five companies leading fundamental research has recently been
announced]{.underline}.22 More broadly, it is crucial that we learn from
the lessons of past technologies and, where possible, develop principles
and methodologies that we can take forward. [This may give us an
**[advantage in]{.mark}** [preparing for developments]{.mark} that are
currently [beyond]{.mark} our [horizon]{.mark} and **[that
methodologies]{.mark}** too deeply [tied to specific]{.mark}
technologies and **[risks may not]{.mark}**]{.underline} allow. One of
the key concerns associated with risks from emerging and future
technologies is the rate at which progress occurs and at which the
associated threats may [arise. While every science will throw up
specific challenges and require domain-specific techniques and
expertise, any [tools]{.mark} or methodologies [that]{.mark} help us to
[intervene]{.mark} reliably [earlier are]{.mark} to be
[welcomed]{.mark}]{.underline}. There may be a limited window of
opportunity for averting such risks. Indeed, this window may occur in
the early stages of developing a technology, well before the fully
mature technology is out in the world, where it is difficult to control.
Once Pandora's box is open, it is very difficult to close. WORKING ON
THE (DOOMSDAY) CLOCK [Technological progress now offers us a vision of a
remarkable future]{.underline}. The advances that have brought us onto
an unsustainable pathway have also raised the quality of life
dramatically for many, and have unlocked scientific directions that can
lead us to a safer, cleaner, more sustainable world. [[With the right
developments]{.mark} and applications of technology, [in concert
with]{.mark} advances in **[social, democratic]{.mark}**, and
distributional [processes]{.mark} globally, [progress]{.mark} [can be
ma**de on all**]{.mark} of the [challenges]{.mark} discussed
here]{.underline}. Advances in renewable energy and related
technologies, and more efficient energy use---advances that are likely
to be accelerated by progress in technologies such as artificial
intelligence---can bring us to a point of zero-carbon emissions. New
manufacturing capabilities provided by synthetic biology may provide
cleaner ways of producing products and degrading waste. A greater
scientific understanding of our natural world and the ecosystem services
on which we rely will aid us in plotting a trajectory whereby critical
environmental systems are maintained while allowing human flourishing.
Even advances in education and women's rights globally, which will play
a role in achieving a stable global population, can be aided
specifically by the information, coordination, and education tools that
technology provides, and more generally by growing prosperity in the
relevant parts of the world. There are [catastrophic and
**[exi]{.mark}**stential [risks]{.mark} that we [will]{.mark} simply
[not be]{.mark} able to [overcome **without advances**]{.mark} in
science and technology.]{.underline} These include possible **[pandemic
outbreaks]{.underline}**, whether natural or engineered. The early
identification of **[incoming asteroids]{.underline}**, and approaches
to shift their path, is a topic of active research at NASA and
elsewhere. While currently there are no known techniques to prevent or
mitigate a [supervolcanic eruption, this may not be the case with the
tools at our disposal a century from now]{.underline}. And in the longer
run, a civilization that has spread permanently beyond the earth,
enabled by advances in spaceflight, manufacturing, robotics, and
terraforming, is one that is much more likely to endure. [However, the
breathtaking power of the tools we are developing is not to be taken
lightly]{.underline}. We have been very lucky to muddle through the
advent of nuclear weapons without a global catastrophe. And within this
century, it is realistic to expect that we will be able to rewrite much
of biology to our purposes, intervene deliberately and in a large-scale
way in the workings of our global climate, and even develop agents with
intelligence that is fundamentally alien to ours, and may vastly surpass
our own in some or even most domains---a [development [that]{.mark}
would [have]{.mark} uniquely [unpredictable
consequences.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is reassuring to note that there
are relatively **[[few individual events]{.mark} that could
[cause]{.mark} an existential [catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}**---one
resulting in extinction or a permanent civilizational collapse. Setting
aside the very rare events (such as supervolcanoes and asteroids), the
most plausible candidates include nuclear winter, extreme global warming
or cooling scenarios, the accidental or deliberate release of an
organism that radically altered the planet's functioning, or the release
of an engineered pathogen. They also include more speculative future
advances: new types of weaponry, runaway artificial intelligence, or
maybe physics experiments beyond what we can currently envisage. Many
global risks are, in isolation, survivable---at least for some of
us---and it is likely that human civilization could recover from them in
the long run: less severe global warming, various environmental
disasters and ecosystem collapses, widespread starvation, most pandemic
outbreaks, conventional warfare (even global). However, this latter
class of risks, and factors that might drive them (such as population,
resource use, and climate change) should not be ignored in the broader
study of existential risk. Nor does it make sense to consider these
challenges in isolation: [in [our interconnected world]{.mark} they [all
affect each other]{.mark}]{.underline}. The threat of global nuclear war
has not gone away, and many scholars believe that it may be rising again
(at the time of writing, North Korea has just undergone its most
ambitious nuclear test to date). If climate pressures, drought, famine,
and other resource pressures serve to escalate geopolitical tensions, or
if the potential use of a new technology, such as geoengineering, could
lead to a nuclear standoff, then the result is an existential threat.
For all these reasons and more, a growing community of scholars across
the world believe that the twenty-first century will see greater change
and greater challenges than any century in humanity's past history. It
will be a century of unprecedented global pressures, and a century in
which extreme and unpredictable events are likely to happen more
frequently than ever before in the past. It [will also be a century in
which the power of [technologies]{.mark} unlike any we have had in our
past history will [hang over us like]{.mark} multiple **[Damocles'
swords.]{.mark}**]{.underline} But it will also be a century in which
the technologies we develop, and the [[institutional structures we
develop]{.underline}]{.mark}, may [[aid]{.underline}]{.mark} us [[in
solving]{.underline}]{.mark} many of the [[problems]{.underline}]{.mark}
we currently face---if we guide their development, and their uses and
applications, carefully.

[Realising the benefits AI offers requires building]{.underline} and
maintaining the [public's trust: citizens need to be confident AI is
being developed and used in an ethical and trustworthy
manner]{.underline}2 [. AI poses considerable risks and challenges to
society which have raised concerns about whether AI systems are worthy
of trust.]{.underline} These [concerns have been fuelled by high profile
cases of AI use that were biased, discriminatory, manipulative,
unlawful, or violated human rights.]{.underline} This survey is the
first to take a deep dive into understanding citizen trust and
expectations of AI use across multiple countries. To do this, we
surveyed a nationally representative sample of 1,200+ citizens from the
United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia,
respectively (total sample 6,054). We asked about AI systems in general,
as well as AI systems in two domains -- healthcare and human resources
-- where AI is rapidly being deployed and is likely to impact large
numbers of citizens. Our findings provide important and timely research
insights into citizens' trust and attitudes towards AI. We draw on these
insights to lay out an evidence-based pathway for strengthening trust
and acceptance of AI systems, and discuss the implications for
government, business and non-government organisations (NGOs). Below, we
summarise the key findings. Most of these findings hold across all
countries and therefore are reported in aggregate form. Significant
country differences in the findings are highlighted.

Trust in artificial intelligence [Trust is central to the acceptance of
AI, and is influenced by]{.underline} four key drivers [Our results
confirm that trust strongly influences AI acceptance, and hence is
important for the societal uptake of AI and realising its
benefits]{.underline}. [There are four key drivers that influence
citizens' trust in AI systems: 1) beliefs about the adequacy of current
regulations and laws to make AI use safe]{.underline}, 2) the perceived
impact of AI on jobs, 3[) familiarity and understanding of AI,
and]{.underline} 4) [the perceived uncertain impact of AI on
society]{.underline}. These drivers are important across all five
countries. Of these drivers, the perceived adequacy of current
regulations and laws is clearly the strongest. [This highlights the
importance of ensuring adequate regulatory and legal mechanisms are in
place to protect people from the risks associated with AI use. Such
regulation in turn supports citizen uptake and adoption. Citizens have
low trust in AI systems but generally 'accept' or
'tolerate']{.underline} AI Trust in AI is low across the five countries,
with citizens generally wary or ambivalent about trusting AI systems.
Only about a quarter (28%) of citizens are willing to trust AI systems
in general. Two out of five citizens are unwilling to share their
information or data with an AI system and a third are unwilling to trust
the output of AI systems (e.g. a recommendation or decision). While many
citizens are hesitant to trust AI systems, they generally accept (42%)
or tolerate (28%) AI, but few approve (15%) or embrace (6%) it, and some
outright reject AI (9%). Citizens' trust and support of AI depends on
the purpose of the AI system: the public is more trusting and supportive
of AI use in healthcare (i.e. for aiding medical diagnosis and
treatment), and less trusting and supportive of AI use in human
resources (i.e. for aiding hiring and promotion decisions). Citizens
also view the benefits of AI in healthcare as greater than the risks,
whereas they view the risks of AI in human resources as greater than the
benefits. However[, regardless of the application, citizens are still
wary with the majority unwilling or ambivalent about trusting AI in both
healthcare (63%) and human resources (77%).]{.underline} Younger
generations, notably Gen Z and Millennials, are generally more trusting
and accepting of AI systems than older generations. In Germany and
Australia, those with a university education are also more accepting of
AI than those without a degree. Confidence in entities to develop, use
and regulate AI varies across countries Citizens have the most
confidence in their national universities and research institutions, as
well as their defence organisations, to develop and use (71-77%) and
regulate and govern AI (67-73%) in the best interest of the public. In
contrast, citizens have less confidence in governments and commercial
organisations to do this. 58% -- 62% have confidence in commercial
organisations and government to develop and use AI, and 54 -- 58% have
confidence in these entities to regulate and govern AI. This may be
because most citizens believe commercial organisations (62%) and
government (52%) innovate with AI for financial gain, rather than for
societal benefit. Countries differ in their confidence of entities to
use and govern AI. Americans are less confident in a broad range of
entities to regulate and govern AI, compared to citizens in other
countries. US and UK respondents are also less confident in their
governments to develop and use AI in the public's best interest compared
to other countries, a finding that mirrors the lower trust these
countries have in their governments more generally. In contrast,
Australians are more confident in their research institutions and
defence forces to develop, use and regulate AI. ©2021 The University of

expect AI to be regulated with external, independent oversight The large
majority of citizens (81%) expect AI to be regulated]{.underline}. While
there are small country differences, there is [general
agreement]{.underline} (61-62%) [that there should be a new, dedicated
independent AI regulator, and that government and existing regulators
should play a role in the regulation of AI systems. Co-regulation and
involvement of industry that develop or use AI is also seen as desirable
by the majority]{.underline} (54-59%). US respondents are less likely
than respondents in other countries to report that government and
existing regulators should regulate AI, and more likely to believe AI
regulation is not required. In contrast, UK respondents are more likely
to expect a new, dedicated, independent AI regulator than other
countries. [Current safeguards are insufficient given the uncertainty
around AI Despite the strong expectations of AI regulation, most
citizens]{.underline} (67%) across the five countries either
[disagree]{.underline} or are ambivalent [that current regulations and
laws are sufficient to make the use of AI safe.]{.underline} [This
powerfully highlights the importance of strengthening and
**communicating the regulatory and legal framework governing AI**
(including data privacy laws) **across** all surveyed
**countries**]{.underline}. Most citizens (66-79%) in each country
believe the impact of AI on society is uncertain and unpredictable. It
is therefore not surprising that the large majority (96%) expect AI
governance challenges to be carefully managed. The public view data
challenges such as surveillance (61%), fake online content (60%),
cyber-attacks (60%), and data privacy (59%) to be the most likely to
impact large numbers of citizens within their country in the next 10
years. Half also viewed disease misdiagnosis as likely to impact
society. [Citizens expect organisations to uphold the principles of
trustworthy AI Citizens in each country have very clear expectations of
the principles and related practices they expect organisations deploying
AI systems to uphold in order to be trusted. These principles mirror
those proposed by the European Commission's High Level Expert Group on
AI. Almost all citizens (95%) expect AI systems to meet high standards
of:]{.underline} -- performance and accuracy -- data privacy -- security
and governance -- [**transparency and explainability -- accountability
-- risk and impact mitigatio**n -- fairness -- human
oversight]{.underline} Most citizens (more than 57%) would be more
willing to use AI systems if assurance mechanisms were in place, such as
independent AI ethics reviews, AI ethics certifications, national
standards for transparency, and AI codes of conduct. [Organisations can
directly build trust and consumer willingness to use AI systems by
supporting and implementing these mechanisms]{.underline}. ©2021 The

Citizens feel comfortable with some but not all uses of AI at work Only
about one in five citizens (22%) believe AI will create more jobs than
it will eliminate. Despite this, 45% of employed citizens report using
AI in their work, but most use AI rarely or occasionally. Most citizens
(70-76%) are comfortable with the use of AI at work for the purposes of
task automation and augmentation. However, they are less comfortable
with the use of AI for employeefocused activities, such as monitoring
and evaluating employees, or in recruitment and selection. Citizens want
to know more about AI but currently have low awareness and understanding
of AI and its uses Most citizens (62%) have heard about AI. However,
three out of every five citizens report a low understanding of AI,
including how and when it is used in everyday applications. For example,
even though 76% of citizens use social media, only 41% are aware social
media uses AI. Men and the university-educated are more likely to be
aware of AI and understand when it is being used. The good news is that
most citizens across all countries (83%) want to know more about AI.
Considered together, the results suggest there is a strong need and
appetite for a public AI literacy program. A pathway to strengthen
public trust in AI Collectivel[y these survey insights provide an
**evidence-based pathway** **for building and maintaining the trust**
and acceptance of AI systems by citizens]{.underline} of western
nations. As we discuss in detail in the concluding section[, **this
pathway requires government** and business **to take action
by**]{.underline}: 1) living up to citizens' expectations of trustworthy
AI, 2) [strengthening the regulatory framework for governing
AI,]{.underline} and 3) enhancing AI literacy of the public and
employees. The survey insights are relevant for informing AI policy and
practice within business, government, and NGOs at the national level, as
well as multinational and pan-governmental AI policy and practice (e.g.
the Global Partnership on AI). Resources are available to support
organisations to embed the principles and practices of trustworthy AI
into their everyday operations, and put in place mechanisms that support
stakeholder trust in their use of AI3 . Given the rapid investment and
deployment of AI, it will be [important to regularly re-examine public
trust and expectations of AI systems as they evolve over time, to ensure
AI use is aligned with and meeting societal expectations.]{.underline}

[The benefits and promise of AI for society and business are undeniable.
AI is helping people make better predictions and informed decisions,
enabling innovation, productivity gains and improved efficiency, and
lowering costs.]{.underline} It is helping protect physical and
financial security and facilitating the global fight against COVID-19,
to name just a few of its beneficial applications. [The risks and
challenges that AI poses for society are equally undeniable. These
include the risk of codifying and reinforcing unfair biases, infringing
on human rights such as privacy, spreading fake online content,
technological unemployment and the dangers stemming from mass
surveillance technologies, critical AI failures and autonomous weapons.
These issues are causing public concern and raising questions about the
trustworthiness and regulation of AI systems6 . The public's trust in AI
technologies is vital for continual acceptance. If AI systems do not
prove to be worthy of trust, their widespread acceptance and adoption
will be hindered, and the potentially vast societal and economic
benefits will not be fully realised]{.underline}7 . Despite the central
importance of trust, to date little is known about citizens' trust in AI
or what influences it across countries. Prior public attitude surveys8
have instead examined general acceptance and support. In 2020, we
conducted the first deep dive survey examining Australians' trust in AI
systems (Lockey, Gillespie & Curtis, 2020). This report extends this
deep dive on trust in AI by examining citizen perspectives across five
nation states: the United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom
and Australia. This multi-country survey is designed to understand and
quantify citizens' trust in and support of AI, to benchmark these
attitudes over time, as well as explore similarities and differences in
trust and expectations across five western countries. Understanding
[similarities and differences across countries is important given AI
systems are not bounded by physical borders and are rapidly being
deployed and used across the glob]{.underline}e. By taking this deep
dive into the question of trust, this research provides a comprehensive
and nuanced understanding of US, Canadian, German, UK and Australian
citizens' trust in AI systems. The research provides insights into the
key drivers of trust, community expectations and confidence in the
regulation of AI and management of societal challenges associated with
AI. It also sheds light on citizens' current understanding and awareness
of AI, and the practices and principles citizens expect organisations to
use to responsibly design, develop, deploy and govern AI in society and
the workplace.

#### AI innovation key to NATO cohesion 

**Soare 21 \--** (Simona R. Soare is the author and editor of numerous
books, articles and chapters on transatlantic and European security,
defence innovation and technology transfers. She holds a PhD in
Political Science/International Security from the National School of
Political Studies and Public Administration and is a US Department of
State fellow and a James S. Denton fellow, \"Innovation as Adaptation:

https://www.gmfus.org/news/innovation-adaptation-nato-and-emerging-technologies)//Alk

During the Cold War, the allies had dedicated instruments---for example,
the Cooperation Committee---to monitor and control technological
diffusion. Now, [to facilitate innovation and improve its adaptability
through innovation, NATO needs a strategic-level, civil-military
capacity for horizon scanning, technology assessment, and monitoring.
Such a capability would build on work currently undertaken by NATO ACT
and the Science and Technology Organization]{.underline}, and it would
be complementary to the Innovation Board and Defense Innovation
Accelerator. However, it would broaden the scope to include a variety of
military and civilian, state, and private-sector actors active in the
EDTs innovation ecosystem. [It would deliver constant understanding
(including taxonomies) and intelligence on technological developments in
academia, the private sector, and the military across the alliance, as
well as the authority to link such developments to NATO innovation
priorities]{.underline}. It would contribute to the resilience of allies
by monitoring the transfer of jointly agreed critical EDTs (software and
hardware) to non-NATO and non-partner countries. And it would provide
intelligence and understanding among the allies on adversarial
developments in defense innovation and EDTs uptake. Established as a
distinct entity or within an existing NATO structure, this capability
should regularly consult with competent EU bodies to exchange
information, improve understanding, and facilitate coordination on
output and commonality of purpose. Figuring out the added value of
NATO-enabled innovation in EDTs and how to build a sustainable and
mutually reinforcing relationship with prevalent national innovation
efforts is another key element. Prioritization is essential in
innovation efforts, particularly when there is little certainty about
what technology areas or combinations yield sustainable strategic
advantages. Without discussing the merits of every innovation effort,
NATO should adopt a strategic "systems of systems" focus on innovation
in EDTs. While there is merit in strategic planning for individual
technology areas, the added value in alliance defense innovation efforts
is a more applied focus on technology convergence---what [mix of
**[new]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nologies [deliver]{.mark} the more
[sustainable strategic military advantage in]{.mark}** the medium- and
long-term [in the context of **great-power competition**]{.mark}. For
example, **the [integration]{.mark} [of AI]{.mark}**, autonomy, and
digitally enabled human enhancement [opens]{.mark} multiple
[possibilities of adversarial exploitation of]{.mark} the [cognitive and
physical domain]{.mark}]{.underline}.23 Some work in this field is
ongoing, but [it requires more investment, frequent iteration, and a
larger scale]{.underline}. In February, the Science and Technology
Organization organized a two-day tabletop exercise that explored
combinations of new technologies and their efficiency in various
scenarios.24 Similarly, in May the European Defense Agency organized a
ten-day Technology Foresight Exercise to inform the revision of the
European research and capability development priorities.25 Rob Murray,
the head of NATO Innovation Unit has argued that "the nations that win
\[the technology adoption\] race may be those with the most agile
bureaucracy rather those with the best technology."26 [**[Organizational
change is a prerequisite of success]{.mark} [in]{.mark} defense
[innovation and the adoption]{.mark} of EDTs**---and one aspect of
NATO's adaptation patterns]{.underline}. But it is only one measure of
its success. [Setting the right benchmarks for defense innovation and
EDTs is also critical and it requires a link to clear and measurable
improvements in military capabilities, posture and power projection,
enhanced resilience, and deterrence and defense in a multi-domain
framework, as well as the ability to compete below the threshold of
armed conflict against hybrid threats]{.underline}. To [this effect,
NATO needs to be linked to more experimentation, wargaming]{.underline},
and red teaming [to determine how deterrence, defense, and operational
capacity will evolve, how resilience can be enhanced, and how to disrupt
rival coercive operations,]{.underline} above and below the threshold of
armed conflict, [across all domains of warfare. Not all allies have the
defense funding, technological capacity, skills, and military
infrastructure to facilitate rapid defense innovation, including the
adoption and scaling of emerging technologies]{.underline}. And [not all
that have such resources and knowledge are willing to share them in
collaborative innovation processes. Leading allies---the United
States]{.underline}, France, the United Kingdom, and the
Netherlands---[already have national-focused approaches to the adoption
of EDTs.]{.underline} By contrast, for most Central and Eastern
countries EDTs in defense are mainly a long-term prospect. Previous
challenges in integrating cyber capabilities into NATO operations,
persistent capability gaps among the allies, and slow standardization
procedures are a good indication of the magnitude of the challenge,
which is acknowledged at the highest levels of NATO decision-making[. As
Secretary-General Stoltenberg has stated, a technological gap between
the allies would undermine interoperability and weaken alliance
cohesion.]{.underline} In the context of the NATO AI and big data
strategies and the Defense Innovation Accelerator, [allies should
reflect on how to improve and facilitate technological transfers among
themselves.]{.underline} This could enable smaller allies [to specialize
in niche EDTs capabilities, as has been the case with cyber, for
example, and could prevent the]{.underline} [emergence of new
technological and capability gaps between the allies]{.underline}. The
[Biden administration's focus on shared democratic values and the
digital agenda, and its willingness to strengthen NATO and technology
partnerships, constitute a window of opportunity for the
alliance]{.underline}. [It should be fully capitalized on to accelerate
transatlantic collaborative defense innovation.]{.underline}

Escalation: Can a NATO - Russia conflict be managed?

[[Once]{.mark} a [conflict was **under way**, the "**fog of war**"
and]{.mark} **rising [unpredictability]{.mark}** [would **inevitably**
set]{.mark} in, **complicating** the implementation of any]{.underline}
predetermined theories of escalation, deescalation and inter-[conflict
management. The **actual** dynamics of]{.underline} a
[conflict]{.underline} and the perceptions of the stakes involved [are
**extremely difficult** to predict. Simulations]{.underline} and
table-top exercises can [give]{.underline} only [limited
insights]{.underline} into the actual decision-making processes and
interactions.

Still, [[Russian]{.mark} military [theorists]{.mark}]{.underline} and
practitioners seem to **[[assume]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [a
[conflict]{.mark} with NATO [can be]{.mark} **managed** and
**[controlled]{.mark}** in a way that would bring it to a **swift end**
consistent with Russian aims. The [Russian **theory**]{.mark} **of
victory**]{.underline} would [seek to [**exploit weak points**
in]{.mark} an [Alliance]{.mark} war effort. Based on the **conviction**
that democracies are weak and]{.underline} their leaders and populations
are [risk-averse, [Russia]{.mark} may **[assume]{.mark}**
that]{.underline} its [[threats of]{.mark} **horizontal** or **vertical
[escalation]{.mark}** [could be]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly
[[effective. It would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [try to bring home the
notion]{.underline} that [it has **much higher stakes** in the
conflict]{.underline} (regime survival) [than]{.underline} a majority of
the [NATO members]{.underline} involved, [and]{.underline} thus [will be
ready to **[push]{.mark} the [boundaries]{.mark}** of]{.underline} the
[conflict further. It would]{.underline} most likely [[try to]{.mark}
**test** and **[exploit]{.mark}** potential **[divisions]{.mark}**
within the Alliance, combining **selective diplomacy** and
**activation** of its intelligence assets in]{.underline} some [NATO
states]{.underline} with a degree of selectivity in terms of targets of
particular attacks.

[**[Any]{.mark}** NATO-Russia [conflict would]{.mark} **inevitably**
[have a **nuc**]{.mark}**lear [dimension]{.mark}**. The role of
**nuclear weapons** as a tool [for **escalation control**]{.mark} for
Russia has been]{.underline} thoroughly [debated by experts, but
when]{.underline} and how [Russia might use]{.underline} (and not merely
showcase or activate) [nuclear weapons in a conflict remains an **open
question**. Beyond]{.underline} catch phrases such as ["**escalate to
de-escalate**"]{.underline} or "escalate to win" [[there are a]{.mark}
**wider [range]{.mark}** [of options for Russian]{.mark} **nuclear
weapon [use]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [[a single
**nuclear**]{.mark} **warning [shot]{.mark}** [could be lethal]{.mark}
or non-lethal. It could be directed against a]{.underline} purely
[military target or a]{.underline} military-[civilian one. [Detonation
could be]{.mark} configured for an [**EMP effect**. A "**false
flag**"]{.mark} attack is]{.underline} also [conceivable. These
options]{.underline} might be used to [**signal escalation** and could
**significantly [complicate]{.mark}** NATO's
[responses]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Neither NATO nor its member states have developed a similar theory of
victory. Public NATO documents stipulate the general goals for the
Alliance: defend against any armed attack and, as needed, restore the
full sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states. [It is less
clear how far the Alliance would be **willing to escalate** the
conflict]{.underline} to achieve these goals, [and what
mechanisms]{.underline} and means [it would use while trying to
maintain]{.underline} some degree of [control]{.underline} over the
conflict.

[The goals]{.underline} and methods [of waging a [conflict]{.mark} with
Russia [would]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [[have to be limited]{.mark}
in order [to avoid]{.mark} a **massive [nuclear exchang]{.mark}e**. Such
limitations]{.underline} would also involve restrictions on striking
back against targets on Russian territory. But too narrow an approach
[could put **too much restraint** on NATO's operations: the Russian
**regime's stability** may]{.underline} ultimately [need to be
threatened]{.underline} in order [to **force the leadership** into
**terminating** the conflict]{.underline}. NATO would thus need to
establish what a proportional self-defence response to Russian actions
would involve, and to what extent cyber operations or attacks against
military targets in quite different parts of Russia would be useful as
tools of escalation to signal NATO's resolve. Moreover, individual NATO
Allies, especially those directly affected by Russia's actions, might
pursue their individual strategies of escalation.

With regards to the nuclear dimension in NATO escalation plans, given
the stakes involved, this element would most likely be handled by the
three nuclear-weapon members of the Alliance, with the US taking the
lead. The existence of three independent centres of nuclear
decision-making could be exploited to complicate Russian planning and
introduce uncertainty into the Russian strategic calculus, but some
degree of "P3" dialogue and coordination would be beneficial. This
coordination would not necessarily focus on nuclear targeting, but
rather on designing coordinated operations to demonstrate resolve in
order to keep the conflict below the nuclear threshold, or bring it back
under the threshold after first use.

[[Relying on]{.mark} concepts of **[escalation
control]{.mark}**]{.underline} and on lessons [from the Cold
War]{.underline} confrontation [[might be **misleading**]{.mark}. The
circumstances in which a [**Russia-NATO conflict** would]{.mark} play
out would [be]{.mark} **radically different** from the 20th
century]{.underline} screenplay. Moreover, [instead of
**gradual**]{.underline} (linear) [escalation or **salami tactics**
escalation, it is possible to imagine]{.underline} surprizing [["**leap
frog**" escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}, possibly
[connected]{.underline} with actions [in **different
domains**]{.underline} (e.g. a cyberattack against critical
infrastructure). Flexibility, good intelligence and inventiveness in
responding to such developments would be crucial.

Conflict termination

[Russian and NATO assumptions regarding conflict termination
would]{.underline} most likely [**not survive** the **first hours**
of]{.underline} an [actual conflict. [Both sides]{.mark} are capable of
**[underestimat]{.mark}ing** the **[resolve]{.mark}** of the other side
to prevail]{.underline} in a conflict [and the other side's
**willingness** to]{.underline} commit the necessary resources and
[endure the costs, especially once both]{.underline} sides [start
committing]{.underline} their [political capital]{.underline} and
resources and the casualties accumulate.

#### Military cooperation key to increasing transparency

[Direct military-to-military engagement on deconfliction measures for AI
and autonomous systems could be valuable, both as a precursor to
potentially more fulsome specific measures, but also a valuable
communication mechanism in their own right.]{.underline} For example,
[if militaries deploy an autonomous vehicle into a contested area where
other military forces will be operating, a direct military-to-military
channel would give the other side an opportunity to ask questions about
its behavior and the deploying side an opportunity to communicate
expectations, **to avoid unintended escalation** or
incidents.]{.underline} Similarly, [such a venue would give militaries
an opportunity to ask questions and communicate information about other
capabilities or investments that may threaten mutual stability, such as
investments in AI, autonomy, or automation in nuclear
operations]{.underline}. There are many advantages of direct, private
communication over more indirect, public communication. Nations can send
targeted messages just to the intended audience, rather than dealing
with multiple audiences, including domestic ones. [There may be
**reduced political pressure** to save face or show strength
publicly,]{.underline} although of course some of these pressures may
still exist in private channels. [And direct discussions afford more
high-bandwidth information exchange with greater back-and-forth between
sides than may be possible via public messages broadcast to a wider
audience.]{.underline} One challenge, of course, is that these dialogues
are most challenging precisely when they are needed the most: when there
is a lack of transparency and trust on both sides. [However, history
shows that such **dialogues are possibl**e and indeed can be valuable
measures in **increasing transparency and reducing mutual
risks.**]{.underline}

known as the Washington Treaty, [[establishes]{.mark} **NATO [legal
authority]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [**organization**, and

and a military entity. NATO\'s political leader is the Secretary General
(currently Mr. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, a Danish citizen), while its
military leader is the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR)
(currently U.S. Air Force General Philip M. Breedlove). The treaty
establishes both a political and military role for the organization. 1.
Core Mission and Article 5 **[Article 5 of the treaty states the core
mission of NATO]{.underline}**. 12 This mission is based upon article 51
of the UN Charter, which provides for **[collective
self-defense.]{.underline}** Article 5 states as follows: [The Parties
agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or
North America shall be considered an attack against them all and
consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of
them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense
recognized by article 51]{.underline} of the Charter of the United
Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking
forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such
action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to
restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. 13 [NATO
invoked the provisions of article 5]{.underline} to the treaty for the
first time in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks on the
United States. 14 NATO Operation Active Endeavor (naval operations in
support of 9/11 counterterrorism missions in the Mediterranean) was one
of the first NATO operations authorized under article 5. 15 2[**.
Non-Article 5 Activity [Not all NATO military activity]{.mark}** [can
be]{.mark} justified [under article 5]{.mark} to the
treaty]{.underline}. [[NATO]{.mark} member [states]{.mark}]{.underline}
16 [[have an obligation to **train** and **prepare for**]{.mark} **their
[defense]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[This is articulated [in article

is reflected in the **[article 4 require]{.mark}ment**]{.underline}
[that [parties **consult one another**]{.mark}]{.underline} to resolve
disputes or identify potential threats to the alliance. 18 These
authorities have been interpreted to give NATO its own engagement
activity (mirroring the activity of a U.S. combatant command), such as
the Partnership for Peace and the Mediterranean Dialogue. 19 While
article 5 is a good start point in articulating the legal basis for
traditional NATO operations, the LEGAL) may also refer to underlying
United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR) giving authority to
engage in armed conflict under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. 20 In this
light, [NATO doctrine provides for operational responses beyond article
5 self-defense.]{.underline} To address the multitude of security
scenarios facing the alliance, [**[NATO]{.underline}** [doctrine
recognizes]{.underline}]{.mark} [a category of activity known **as
[Non-Article 5 Crisis Response Operations]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(NA5CRO). 21 [Non-Article 5 operations [cover contingencies that do not
amount to a response to an armed attack on alliance
territory]{.mark}]{.underline}. 22 The earliest example of this type of
operation includes the NATO-lead of the Implementation Force (IFOR) in
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 23 The doctrine states as follows: [NA5CRO range
from support operations primarily associated with civil agencies through
operations in support of peace]{.underline}, **[countering irregular
threat activities]{.underline}**, to combat . . . this could include,
but is not limited to, extraction operations, [tasks in support of
disaster relief and humanitarian operations, search and

operations (NEOs), [freedom of navigation and overflight
enforcement]{.underline}, sanction and embargo enforcement, support to
stabilization and reconstruction activities, peace enforcement (PE), and
counterinsurgency (COIN). 24 3. Organizational Authority Under Article 9
The North Atlantic Treaty establishes the North Atlantic Council (NAC).
25 [All NATO entities owe their base authority to some action taken by
the NAC]{.underline}. As part of NATO\'s basic functions, [the NAC
establishes subsidiary bodies which include political, military, and
other organizational entities within NATO.]{.underline} On the military
side, the NAC established the Military Committee (MC), which provides
direction and guidance on military policy and strategy. 26 [The MC is
supported by its International Military Staff (IMS). Among other things,
the NAC approves rules of engagement (ROE) and target lists for
specified NATO operations]{.underline}. 27 The NAC is chaired by the
Secretary General of NATO (Mr. Anders Fogh Rasmussen), who builds
consensus within this political and military body. The Secretary General
is supported by the International Staff (IS) who works NATO\'s political
agenda. [The NAC is also empowered to establish a form of subsidiary
body that is now known as a NATO Agency]{.underline}. 28 NATO Agencies
are the executive body within a subsidiary body. 29 NATO agencies
include such entities as the NATO Standardization Agency (NSA), NATO
Mamtenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA), and the NATO Communications and
Information System Services Agency (NCSA). 30 Soldiers who eat at a NATO

Security Cooperation (SC) Overview

The Department of Defense (**[[DOD]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[[uses]{.underline}]{.mark} the term **[[security]{.mark}
[cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}** (SC) [to refer **[broadly]{.mark}**
to DOD interactions with foreign security establishments. SC activities
include]{.underline}

• the [transfer of defense articles and services]{.underline};

• **[[mil]{.mark}itary-[to-mil]{.mark}itary
[exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}**;

• [military [education]{.mark}, training, and advising; and]{.underline}

• [[capacity]{.mark} [building]{.mark} of partner security
forces.]{.underline}

[SC programs are intended to encourage and [enable partner
nations]{.mark}]{.underline} (PNs) **[[to work with the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited [[**S**t]{.mark}ates to achieve strategic
objectives]{.underline}. They are considered a key tool for achieving
U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives. [These activities
are [executed through **both** **DOD**-]{.mark}administered **SC
[programs]{.mark}**]{.underline} (authorized **[[under Title
10]{.underline}]{.mark}**, U.S.C.) **[[and
DOD]{.underline}]{.mark}**-implemented State Department
([**[DOS]{.underline}**) **[security assistance]{.underline}**]{.mark}
(SA) [programs]{.underline} (authorized [[under]{.underline} **[Title
22]{.underline}**]{.mark}, U.S.C). Beyond grant-based programs, SC
encompasses the Foreign Military Sales program [and]{.underline}
[enables U.S. and PN collaboration on defense articles]{.underline}. The
following sections focus on DOD "Title 10" activities.

SC: Policy and Objectives

SC activities aim to achieve particular objectives in support of U.S.
national security and defense strategies. Specifically, SC may build
defense relationships that promote U.S. security interests, enhance
military capabilities of U.S. allies and partners, and provide the
United States with access to PNs. Under the overarching goal of
furthering U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, SC
emphasizes partnerships, aiming to be mutually beneficial for the United
States and its partners. SC activities aim to develop and strengthen a
PN's ability to provide internal security, contribute to regional
security efforts, combat shared threats, and increase military
interoperability with the United States.

The 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) signaled the Trump
Administration's intention to shift SC activities from nearly two
decades of prioritizing counterterrorism toward "great power
competition" (GPC) with Russia and China. The shift raised questions as
to how SC should be realigned to meet this objective and what the
implications could be for scaling down counterterrorism-focused SC
activities in Africa and the Middle East, especially as Russia and China
increase their influence. Some DOD officials and defense analysts have
suggested that rather than a shift, counterterrorism, as well as
irregular warfare, should remain priorities within GPC. The Biden
Administration has yet to release a new NDS; however, its Interim
National Security Strategic Guidance broadly identifies authoritarianism
and strategic competition as priority threats that require coordination
and cooperation with allies and partners.

SC: Roles and Responsibilities

[Many [SC activities require DOD to coordinate]{.mark} with multiple DOD
components]{.underline} and other federal departments, primarily DOS.
Some DOD SC activities require varying levels of coordination with DOS.
Within DOD, the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy (USD\[P\])
exercises overall direction, authority, and control over SC matters.

[The]{.underline} Defense Security Cooperation Agency
([DSCA]{.underline}) [represents the interests of the Secretary of
Defense and]{.underline} USD(P) in SC matters and [is tasked with
directing, administering, and executing many SC programs,]{.underline}
developing SC policy, and providing DOD-wide SC guidance. DSCA is also
DOD's main interlocutor between the PNs, implementing agencies, and the
defense industry. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special
Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (ASD-SO/LIC) oversees and approves
some SC training activities that are managed by DSCA. U.S. Special
Operations Command (SOCOM) coordinates those SC activities executed by
special operations forces (SOF). DOS leads U.S. foreign aid and has
final say on SA. DOS's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (PM) is the
principal link to DOD and ensures that SA is integrated with other U.S.
policies and activities at the country, regional, and global levels. PM
also determines PN eligibility, appropriate SA programs, and which
defense articles and equipment are permitted for transfer.

Title 10 SC Reforms from the FY2017 NDAA

The post-9/11 period saw the rapid and piecemeal expansion of DOD SC
activities, mainly as temporary authorities that required annual renewal
in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The FY2017 NDAA (P.L.
114-328) consolidated and codified existing Title 10 SC authorities into
10 U.S.C. §§301-386. Other provisions aimed to make improvements to the
SC programs and themselves, as well as improvements in the management
and oversight of those programs. Key reforms from the FY2017 NDAA
included requirements for the following:

• [A consolidated DOD budget request for Title 10 SC programs and
activities]{.underline} (10 U.S.C. §381); the first was released for
FY2019.

• [Harmonized congressional notification requirements for most DOD train
and equip programs]{.underline} (10 U.S.C. §333).

• Institutional capacity building programs to strengthen partner defense
institutions (10 U.S.C. §332).

• A DOD SC Workforce Development Program to manage a professional
workforce in support of SC programs and activities (10 U.S.C. §384).

• A program of assessment, monitoring, and evaluation (AM&E) to be
informed and supported by strategic evaluations on initial PN
assessments, monitoring of implementation, and the efficiency and
effectiveness of SC programs and activities (10 U.S.C. §383).

John: [[Carla]{.underline}]{.mark} is an Assistant Professor of Law and
Director of R&D at Michigan State Law School. She\'s a Faculty Associate
at Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School.
Or is it at the university?

Carla: University.

\*210 John: University, not the law school, which is a think tank
collaboration of a number of top intellectuals in this field of fintech.
Her focus is on the intersection of blockchain and law, but she
[**[knows AI]{.mark}**, because she\'s [authoring a **casebook on AI
and**]{.mark} **the [law]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And she\'s very
familiar with all the writings on this issue, so she\'s an asset to our
discussion here.

I want to do something that. \... [It may seem elementary to
some]{.underline} of you, [but having sat through a number of
discussions of the use of **AI**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[m]{.underline}**achine **[l]{.underline}**earning and large datasets
and analysis for credit-related issues, [I was]{.underline} **[puzzled
exactly how this works]{.underline}**, to be honest with you. [[How does
the]{.underline} **[AI]{.underline}**]{.mark} model
**[[work]{.mark}?]{.underline}** [How does the]{.underline}
**[m]{.underline}**achine **[l]{.underline}**earning
**[model]{.underline}** [work?]{.underline} And [what is]{.underline}
**[done with]{.underline}** big **[datasets]{.underline}**, particularly
non-traditional data that\'s being used more and more by fintech
companies? [As a kickoff]{.underline} to this, [I wanted to ask Carla to
give]{.underline} us [an]{.underline} **[overview]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} how [these particular programs and tools]{.underline},
that are being developed in fairly substantial quantities and numbers,
[how these]{.underline} **[actually work]{.underline}** [and
**[how]{.mark}**]{.underline} the **[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**achine
**[[l]{.underline}]{.mark}**earning and the large dataset analysis
[is]{.underline} **[[deployed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Just how it works,
so we can understand.

Carla: So, in other words, you\'re asking the professor to do what
professors do, which is lay the foundation definitionally. I can do
this. Generally speaking, [there\'s]{.underline} really [[no
straightforward consensus on the definition]{.mark} of]{.underline}
**[a]{.underline}**rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence. As a
result, discussion of AI and its sub-fields really are susceptible to a
lot of hype and confusion. For instance, [people use the term
"**m**]{.underline}achine **[l]{.underline}**earning[" and
"**a**]{.underline}rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence["
**interchangeably**, but they\'re]{.underline} really **[not the
same]{.underline}** thing, and [so the goal here is just to break some
of that down]{.underline} a little bit. [At a pretty high
level]{.underline} still, but just to lay the foundation
[definitionally]{.underline}.

[A]{.underline} **[[best consensus definition of
a]{.underline}]{.mark}**rtificial
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence [[is that it\'s a]{.underline}
**[broad]{.underline}**]{.mark} term, an [**[umbrella term]{.mark}**,
used to refer to a **large set of information science**]{.underline}.
It\'s best understood as [[a set of **techniques aimed at approximating
some aspect of human cognition using machines**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
And the main takeaway is that, [although we use the term "artificial
intelligence" as **though** it\'s]{.underline} [**monolithic**,
it\'s]{.underline} really [**not**. It [covers a range
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**sub fields**]{.mark}, which]{.underline}
**[[include]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and I should say
"[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} **[is [not limited
to]{.mark}]{.underline}**" as lawyers say, [[neural networks]{.mark},
vision, data mining, [expert systems, robotics,]{.mark} natural language
processing, natural language understanding, planning, and evolutionary
computation]{.underline}.

We actually have a class on evolutionary analysis and the law at MSU Law
School, so [all]{.underline} of these [are]{.underline}
**[relevant]{.underline}** [to the legal field and legal issues, but the
one]{.underline} **[primarily]{.underline}** [people think about and
mean when they use the term "**a**]{.underline}rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence[" is]{.underline}
**[m]{.underline}**achine **[l]{.underline}**earning.
**[[M]{.underline}]{.mark}**achine **[[l]{.underline}]{.mark}**earning
[[refers]{.underline}]{.mark} **[generally]{.underline}** [[to
the]{.underline} **[capacity of a system to improve its
performance]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[at some]{.underline}** task, some
**[specific task]{.underline}**, [**over time**. [Often]{.mark}, the
task [involves recognizing **patterns in
datasets**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although machine learning [outputs can
include everything from **translating languages**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} **[grasping objects]{.underline}** [or
helping]{.underline} to **[drive a car]{.underline}**.

\*211 Specifically, machine learning relies on algorithms to analyze
huge datasets. It basically performs predictive analytics far faster
than any human can on a dataset that\'s larger than any human could
reasonably get through efficiently. Notably, however and something I
think that gets lost sometimes in legal discussions, is that, [generally
speaking]{.underline}, oftentimes, [not always but often,
the]{.underline} **[m]{.underline}**achine **[l]{.underline}**earning
[system is]{.underline} both \... and this should be always, is both
**[designed]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[created by
humans]{.underline}**, and then you put inputs into it and it output
results. Those outputs are then interpreted and applied by humans,
right?

SUSCRIE

By August 2021, more than 50 countries have announced their National
Artificial Intelligence Strategies (NAIS). On August 24, 2021[, Turkey
joined these countries by publishing a 100-page document, where it
announced its full AI road map for the next five years]{.underline}
(2021-2025). At the beginning, the strategy provides a general
background of the global developments and trends in the field of AI and
the current situation in Turkey.

Subsequently, the document touches upon the main AI values and
principles that are adopted in the current AI strategy such as, respect
for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law or the principles of
proportionality, fairness, and privacy. At the end, the document touches
upon the main strategic priorities and objectives of the Turkish
government for the next five years followed by a detailed explanation of
the mechanisms of governance that will be created for the implementation
of NAIS and the coordination of the process.

Prepared by the Digital Transformation Office of the Presidency of the
Republic of Turkey and the Ministry of Industry and Technology, the
strategy, among others, laid [out Turkey's aims to increase the share of
artificial intelligence in its GDP to 5%, open 50,000 new jobs in the
sector, and increase the number of AI postgraduate students to 10,000 by
2025.]{.underline} [Within the same period, Turkey plans to become among
the top 20 countries in the international AI indices.]{.underline}

Another challenge for NATO is to standardize rules for all member states
in dealing with AI-enabled autonomous weapon systems. [Countries like
Turkey are working on autonomous weapons and have developed AI-enabled
loitering munitions.]{.underline} Turkey has requested the US for
upgraded F-16 fighter jets that are said to be AI-enabled.25 The Biden
Administration has asked the Congress to approve the upgrade of Turkey's
F-16 fighter jet fleet.26 [Turkey's armed drones have also been used in
the Ukraine conflict. For smooth functioning of such systems**, it will
be necessary for all NATO members** to have standardised rules **when it
comes to deployment of such systems.**]{.underline}

The French perspective is based on the notion that the use force in
international affairs, by a single state or group of states like NATO,
is ultimately governed by the United Nations Charter. [The UN Security
Council is empowered by the Charter to determine the existence of any
threat to or breach of peace]{.underline} (Article 39). At the same
time, the [Charter recognizes that states have the right to defend
themselves]{.underline} individually and collectively (Article 51) and
that regional arrangements or agencies can maintain peace and security
within their region, provided they do so in a manner consistent with the
purposes and principles of the UN (Article 52). [The first purpose of
the UN is to maintain international peace and security (Article 1) and
one of its key principles requires members to refrain from "the threat
or use of force against the territorial integrity or political
independence of any state, or in any manner inconsistent with the
purposes of the United Nations"]{.underline} (Article 2).

substantive matters.]{.underline} Since 1946, all five permanent members
-- widely referred to as the 'P5' -- have exercised the right of veto at
one time or another on a variety of issues[. To date, approximately 49
per cent of the vetoes had been cast by the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics and thereafter the Russian Federation]{.underline} (the
membership of the USSR in the United Nations, including in the Security
Council, was continued by the Russian Federation), 29 per cent by the

[Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution on Friday that would
have demanded that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and
withdraw all troops, a move several Council members said was deplorable,
but inevitable]{.underline}. While 11 of the Council's 15 members voted
in favour of the text, China India, and the United Arab Emirates
abstained. A 'no' vote from any one of the five permanent members of the
Council stops action on any measure put before it. The body's permanent
members are: China, France, Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and
the United States. The Security Council's latest attempt to end the
Ukraine crisis caps a week of activity at the United Nations seeking a
diplomatic offramp to Russian military action in the country, including
near daily press stakeouts by the Secretary-General, three emergency
Council sessions, and one meeting of the 193-member General Assembly,
which saw speaker after speaker call for de-escalation.

Keeping Russia in this inner circle has yielded no benefit for the
international community. [The U.N. is not restraining the Kremlin's
belligerence thus far, and we have no reason to believe that it ever
will if Russia continues to have veto authority.]{.underline} Removing
Russia from the Security Council would signal an end to the impotent
response to the aggression, autocracy and nuclear threat. It would
signal that the U.N. didn't abandon its main purpose. At this point, the
expulsion of Russia is not mere punishment. It is lifesaving necessity.
The time for condemnation, punishment and expectations of changes in
Russian behavior has long since passed. By the time Russia massed more
than 190,000 troops at the Ukrainian border, the international community
was well aware of the imminent threat to Ukrainian sovereignty. Such
action by Russia was again in direct contravention of the Budapest
Memorandum on Security Assurances for Ukraine, signed by Russia, the
U.S. and the United Kingdom in 1994.

### UN Fails

#### Ukraine proves, UN is useless 

**Semler, 22** (Ashley Semler, Currently Senior Producer at the Atlantic
Council. Also has produced for CNN and BBC, 4-15-2022, accessed on
7-23-2022, CNN, \"Why isn't the UN doing more to stop what's happening
in Ukraine?\",
https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/15/politics/united-nations-ukraine-russia/index.html)

Many people who have watched the UN for years agree that the UN Security
Council looks impotent in this moment, with the world watching. [The
Security Council was designed in a different era, after World War II,
with a membership and veto system that have ultimately restricted its
effectiveness in dealing with]{.underline} this [global
conflict.]{.underline} Other parts of the UN have responded more
effectively to the humanitarian and refugee crises the war has created.
Former US Ambassador to the UN [John
Bolton](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/17/politics/bolton-book-what-we-learned/index.html),
who served under Republican Presidents including George W. Bush and
Donald Trump, agreed with Zelensky's assessment. "I thought he was
absolutely right," Bolton told CNN's chief political analyst Gloria
Borger. "And I thought one more convert to understanding what's wrong
with the United Nations. **[Its political institutions are fundamentally
broken."]{.underline}** Bolton has never been a big fan of the UN. He's
famous for saying, back in 1994, that [if the UN Secretariat building in
New York "lost 10 stories, it wouldn't make a bit of
difference."]{.underline} There have been many moments of deadlock
before in the Security Council when the big powers disagree. But this
moment has drawn outsized attention globally. "This is the single
biggest crisis to hit the UN since the end of the Cold War," said
Richard Gowan, the UN Director for the International Crisis Group. "It
is possible that this does mark the beginning of a sort of fundamental
rupture amongst the great powers that will make UN diplomacy see vastly
harder going forward." Bottom of Form [The system was designed this way:
to prevent global conflict but also **to reward the main winners of
World War II**, according to Gowan]{.underline}. Key veto power When the
United Nations [charter was signed in
1945,](https://www.cnn.com/2013/09/03/world/united-nations-fast-facts/index.html)
it established the Security Council with five permanent members and six
nonpermanent members. The permanent members -- the US, the UK, France,
the Soviet Union, and the Republic of China -- were each given the power
to veto any resolutions they opposed. "It was Franklin Roosevelt who
wanted to set up an organization that would police the world after the
defeat of Nazi Germany," Gowan said. "But the only way he could get
Russia and other powers to agree to that deal, was if they had the
ability to block any actions against themselves." The late Soviet Union
leader Joseph Stalin himself insisted on that power as a way for his
state to protect itself. Today[, the Security Council has 15 members,
but the five permanent members have remained the same, with Russia
holding the former Soviet Union's seat and China taking the seat of the
Republic of China. And the veto hasn't changed either]{.underline}.
"What we're seeing is, when there's a fundamental disagreement among the
permanent members, nothing happens," Bolton said.
<https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/06/world/meanwhile-zelensky-un-intl/index.html>The
UN charter also makes it impossible to do another thing Zelensky
suggested: kick Russia off the Security Council, because the country can
veto that too. Over the years, countries and diplomats have suggested to
reform the council by adding more permanent members to make it better
reflect the contemporary geopolitical reality, or even try to take away
the veto power. But no country wants to dilute its power. "I'm being
honest with you, I don't think anyone's going to want to give up their
veto," former US Ambassador to the UN Bill Richardson, who served under
former Democratic President Bill Clinton, told Borger. Richardson points
out that the United States has used the veto to protect its own
interests -- and may need to again. "It helped us in the Iraq War. It
helped us in Bosnia. It helps us in conflicts in Africa," he said. "So
no country that is a permanent member wants to give up their veto. And I
would be against the US giving up their veto right now, just so that we
take action on another issue." In theory, the Security Council "could
impose even more sweeping global economic sanctions on Moscow than we
have already seen. It could technically authorize military action to
push back Russian forces in Ukraine," according to Gowan. **[But with
Russia and likely China set to veto any action taken against the war,
the Security Council is deadlocked.]{.underline}** A massive global
organization The UN is bigger than just the Security Council, and other
areas of the body -- which has six main organs -- have been more active
since Russia invaded Ukraine. "The UN is for airing publicly the
tragedies of the world. Like the refugee crisis in Ukraine, like the
[possible war
crimes](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/politics/putin-war-crimes-russia-ukraine-us-what-matters/index.html),
like so many other human costs that are taking place," Richardson said.
"At the same time, the UN is providing food. The UN is providing refugee
assistance." The UN General Assembly [has condemned Russia
twice](https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-24-22/h_13eed04241e5af379eb8159dc96588e8)
over the war in Ukraine; those resolutions are nonbinding but carry
symbolic weight. Russia was also [suspended from the Human Rights
Council](https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/07/politics/un-russia-human-rights/index.html),
which requires a two-thirds vote. But Bolton said the math behind that
vote shows Russia has significant support around the world; the voting
result was 93 in favor, 24 against and 58 abstentions. A remaining 18
member states were not included in that result. "So here's the real
headline ... A majority of the members of the United Nations, did not
vote to expel Russia," he told Borger. Russian President Vladimir Putin
likely expected these kinds of condemnations, but what he really cares
about is the status and power that being on the Security Council gives
Russia. ["After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow clung on to its
seat in the Security Council essentially as proof that it was still a
big power," Gowan of the International Crisis Group said. "Now, in the
real world ... Russia is not that important. It's China and the US that
are the dominant players, but in the Security Council, the Russians
stand as equal to the US. **And they're very, very proud of having that
status**."]{.underline} And Richardson knows firsthand from his time at
the UN in the 1990s, Russia knows how to play the system. "When I became
UN ambassador for the US, Lavrov, Foreign Minister had been there 10
years already. So he was very skillful," Richardson said. "He knew how
to maneuver in the Security Council. He was very formidable. And so we
have Russia right now, very knowledgeable about UN operations so that's
an advantage that they have." And so the Security Council could only
watch as Russia invaded Ukraine. And in a bizarre split-screen moment,
Russia held the rotating presidency of the Security Council and [even
chaired the meeting](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/02/1112592) as
the invasion began and diplomacy failed. Bolton doesn't see any way to
change the system. **["Unless unicorns break free and sweetness and
light prevails, where there are disagreements among the (permanent)
five, there will be no action," he said.]{.underline}**

[Even accounting for inflation, annual UN expenditure is 40 times higher
than it was in the early 1950s. The organisation now encompasses 17
specialised agencies, 14 funds and a secretariat with 17 departments
employing 41,000 people.]{.underline} Its regular budget, which is
agreed every two years and goes to pay for the cost of administering the
UN -- including mouthwatering daily allowances which result in many of
its bureaucrats being far better paid than American civil servants --
has more than doubled over the past two decades to \$5.4bn. But that is
just a small portion of the total spend. Peacekeeping costs another
\$9bn a year, with 120,000 peacekeepers deployed mostly in Africa. Some
missions have lasted more than a decade. And then there are the
voluntary contributions from individual governments that go to fund a
large part of disaster relief, development work and agencies such as
Unicef. They have risen sixfold over the past 25 years to \$28.8bn. [And
yet even at that level, some agencies are warning that **they are
[operating on the brink of
bankruptcy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/06/refugee-crisis-un-agencies-broke-failing).**]{.underline}

"[There is no single institution]{.underline} that I found more
exhilarating at its best, yet [more debilitatingly

Nations]{.underline}," said Gareth Evans, a former foreign minister of
Australia and strong critic of the way the UN is run. He said his
efforts to advance reform of the UN "were about as quixotic and
unproductive as anything I have ever tried to do". That's a sentiment
widely shared among diplomats and UN officials. Valerie Amos, Britain's
former international development minister, described the UN as a
valuable ally in delivering UK aid but [lamented its
inefficiency]{.underline}. "[There were concerns about the UN being
overly bureaucratic and slow in the way it dealt with development
issues. I think that's one of the criticisms of the UN that remains
until now]{.underline}, that since it was formed it has become bigger
and bigger. [Many organisations have overlapping mandates. It's become
an organisation that's quite unwieldy in lots of respects]{.underline},"
Lady Amos said.

The report said the UN's taste for setting goals at the expense of
delivering results failed the poorest and most vulnerable. It also
criticized a system of funding for many UN programmes in which officials
had to beg for money from governments year after year[, making it
difficult to plan]{.underline}. "[Cooperation between organizations has
been hindered by competition for funding, mission creep and by outdated
business practices,"]{.underline} it said. "In some sectors, such as
water and energy, more than 20 UN agencies are active and compete for
limited resources without a clear collaborative framework. More than 30
UN agencies and programmes have a stake in environmental management."
[The organization has grown so big that at times it is working against
itself. Critics point to large numbers of support staff doing
ill-defined jobs.]{.underline} Staff costs account for two-thirds or
more of some UN agencies' outgoings. "Performance management is a joke,"
said one official. "Almost everyone gets 'above average' in their
assessment." [The UN is so fragmented that each agency has its own IT
system]{.underline}. [The reform report noted that about one-third of
the UN operations in 60 countries had a budget of less than \$2m per
agency, which meant that they could do little more than afford the cost
of running the office.]{.underline} The report proposed extensive
changes to promote greater collaboration and efficiency under a
programme called Delivering as One. [This included myriad UN agencies in
a single country coming under the authority of one official, and working
more closely with the governments of those countries, which often had no
idea what the UN was doing.]{.underline}

[Digital authoritarianism]{.underline}, at its core, [is a mechanism for
exerting increased, unchecked control over one's population through
digital technologies. Censorship, device hacking, and mass surveillance
are all on the table. In this way, digital authoritarianism facilitates
power consolidation---ensuring that challenges to a regime are outed in
advance or quickly observed as they arise, and suppressed]{.underline}.
This exposes US national security to risk. In a world where [citizen
revolt tops the list of authoritarian fears, digital authoritarianism
promises a set of solutions: Internet Protocol (IP) address lists used
to block foreign online content; traffic header inspection to monitor
online activity; legal control of Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
whenever the government wants to shut down Internet services; and
more]{.underline}. Sometimes, [this]{.underline} is quite explicit. The
Russian government, for instance, [strongly promotes information control
in domestic cyberspace for this reason]{.underline}.\[4\] Other times,
the suggestion is more subtle, for example when countries cite fake news
and online disinformation as reasons to censor content deemed
politically undesirable by those in power.\[5\] In either case,
[authoritarian fears of protest and revolt have long driven such regimes
to monitor their citizens. The difference today, however, is that
digital technologies, like Internet packet inspection software and
artificial intelligence (AI) facial recognition, are increasingly making
it cheaper]{.underline} for dictators to do so. [These technologies also
make surveillance more scalable]{.underline}. They also reduce some of
the risks caused by relying on massive networks of human spies and
informants.\[6\] Steven Feldstein points out, for example, that the
principal-agent problem, where, by empowering agents to spy and
suppress, regimes empower them to act against the government, is a
vulnerability that can be reduced by substituting automated surveillance
technologies for human beings.\[7\] In turn, [these technologies can
heighten the speed, scale, and accuracy of authoritarian
surveillance]{.underline}. All of this matters for US national security
because promoting democracy and contesting authoritarianism is in the US
national interest---and digital authoritarianism helps authoritarian
regimes consolidate power. Despite the sometimes resilient nature of
online social movements, [quashing political organization can be easier
than ever before if aided by comprehensive digital surveillance and
control technologies.\[8\] Governments can black out communications,
such as Internet servers or mobile cell towers, during revolt. They can
censor troubling posts before they bubble into something bigger. They
can also censor foreign-originated information that could challenge
regime narratives. Most importantly, they can continuously monitor their
population, including during relatively stable times, to anticipate
movements that could undermine government power.]{.underline} In the
wake of a series of revolts in the Middle East that were informed,
influenced, and/or aided in part by social media and the melding of
online and offline mobilization, digital authoritarians, and those
striving for such ends, are using digital technologies, often dual-use,
to safeguard against such threats.\[9\] As the Russian General Valery
Gerasimov offered in 2013, ["The information space opens wide
asymmetrical possibilities for reducing the fighting potential of the
enemy," making it "necessary to perfect activities in the information
space, including the defense of our own objects
\[objectives\]."\[10\]]{.underline} Many of these governments like
China, Russia, and Iran, are unaligned with the US on security issues.
In the cyber domain, they might engage in everything from pervasive
trade secret theft to cyber attacks on foreign countries' electrical
grids. In more traditional ways, they also pose national security risks
through such vectors as nuclear weapons, military buildup, territorial
aggression against US allies and partners, and disrupting the
international order.\[11\] While US bilateral relationships are complex,
often interconnected, and never zero-sum, elements of those
relationships already pose national security risks. Likewise, other
countries pursuing digital authoritarian practices may be hostile to US
interests (and democratic interests more broadly) or be aligned with
other powers that threaten national security. Power consolidation by
these regimes poses national security risks in various dimensions[. In
some cases, the export and diffusion of digital surveillance tools, as
part of digital authoritarianism, also pose additional national security
risks,]{.underline} the point of focus in the next section.

[China has won the artificial intelligence battle with the

software chief told]{.underline} the Financial Times.
[China]{.underline}, the world's second largest economy, is [likely to
dominate many of the key emerging technologies, particularly artificial
intelligence, synthetic biology and genetics]{.underline} within a
decade or so, according to Western intelligence assessments. [Nicolas
Chaillan, the Pentagon\'s first chief software officer who resigned in
protest against the slow pace of technological transformation in the
U.S. military, said the failure to respond was putting the United States
at risk.\"We have no competing fighting chance against China in 15 to 20
years. Right now, it's already a done deal; it is already

takes a war or not is kind of anecdotal.\" [China]{.underline} was s[et

sluggish innovation, the reluctance of U.S. companies]{.underline} such
as Google [(GOOGL.O)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/GOOGL.O) [to
work with the state on AI and extensive ethical debates over the

Chaillan said, were [obliged to work with their government and were
making \"massive investment\" in AI without regard to

### 1NC -- NO TECH IMPACT 

#### The aff's characterization of AI as primarily military is wrong AND there's no arms race

Center for a New American Security, "Debunking the AI Arms Race Theory",
Accessed 7/21/2022,

Current Military AI Competition Is Not an "Arms Race" As Heather Roff
has written, the [arms race framing "misrepresents the competition going
on among countries."5 To begin with, AI is not a weapon. AI is a
general-purpose enabling technology with myriad
applications.]{.underline} It is [not like a missile or a
tank]{.underline}. It is more like electricity, the internal combustion
engine, or computer networks.6 General-purpose technologies like AI have
applications across a range of industries. Wired magazine co-founder
Kevin Kelly has argued that it "will enliven inert objects, much as
electricity did more than a century ago. Everything that we formerly
electrified we will now cognitize."7 Nations may very well be in a
technology race to adopt AI across a range of industries. AI will help
to improve economic productivity and, by extension, economic and
military power. During the industrial revolution, early adopters of
industrial technology significantly increased their national power. From
1830 to 1890, Britain and Germany, which were both early
industrializers, more than doubled their per capita gross national
product while Russia, which lagged in industrialization, increased its
per capita gross national product by a mere 7 percent over that 60-year
period.8 These technological advantages led to increased economic and
military power, most notably for Europe relative to the rest of the
world. In 1790, Europe (collectively), China, and India (including what
is now Pakistan and Bangladesh) held roughly the same shares of global
manufacturing output, with Europe and India each holding about
one-quarter of global manufacturing output and China holding roughly
one-third. They all had approximately equivalent levels of per capita
industrialization at that time. But the industrial revolution
skyrocketed European economic productivity. By 1900, Europe collectively
controlled 62 percent of global manufacturing output, while China held
only six percent and India less than two percent. These economic
advantages translated into military power. By 1914, Europeans occupied
or controlled over 80 percent of the world's land surface.9 Being ahead
of the curve in adopting AI is likely to lead to significant national
advantages. [Although AI can increase military capabilities, the more
consequential advantages over the long term may come from non-military
AI applications across society.]{.underline} Long-term benefits from AI
could include increased productivity, improved healthcare outcomes,
economic growth, and other indicators of national well-being. Increasing
productivity is especially significant because it has a compounding
effect on economic growth. Over the long term, technological progress is
the main driver of economic growth.10 Of course, AI can also be used for
weapons. Militaries around the world are actively working to adopt AI to
improve their military capabilities. [Yet the militarization of AI does
not, at present, meet the traditional definition of an arms
race]{.underline}, despite the rhetorical urgency of many national
leaders. Michael D. Wallace, in his 1979 article "Arms Races and
Escalation," defined an arms race as "involving simultaneous abnormal
rates of growth in the military outlays of two or more nations"
resulting from "the competitive pressure of the military itself, and not
from domestic forces exogenous to this rivalry." Wallace further stated
that the concept of an arms race only applied "between nations whose
foreign and defense policies are heavily interdependent" and who have
"roughly comparable" capabilities.11 AI is being adopted by many
countries around the globe.12 Arguably at least some of the dyads, such
as the United States and China, meet Wallace's definition in terms of
being nations with "roughly comparable" capabilities, locked in
competition, "whose foreign and defense policies are heavily
interdependent." However[, AI fails the arms race test in the critical
area of spending]{.underline}. Wallace distinguished arms races from the
normal behavior of states to improve their military forces. A state that
adopts a new technology and modernizes its military forces is not
automatically in an arms race, under Wallace's definition, even if the
modernization is aimed at competition with another country. [The
decisive factor in qualifying as an arms race]{.underline}, according to
Wallace[, is the rate of growth in defense spending.]{.underline}
Wallace characterized arms races as resulting in abnormally large growth
rates in defense spending, beyond the historical average of 4 to 5
percent annual growth (in real dollars). In an arms race, annual growth
rates are above 10 percent or even as high as 20 to 25 percent.13 Other
scholars define arms races using different quantitative thresholds ---
and some definitions lack clear quantitative thresholds at all --- but
[the existence of rapid increases in defense spending or military forces
above normal levels is a common criterion in the scholarly literature on
arms races.]{.underline}14 Arms races result in situations in which two
or more countries are locked in spiraling defense spending, grabbing
ever-greater shares of national treasure often with little to no net
gain in relative advantage over the other. Classic historical examples
include the Anglo-German naval arms race prior to World War I and the
U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms race during the Cold War. [Military AI spending
today clearly does not meet these criteria of abnormally large growth
rates in defense spending]{.underline}. AI defense spending is difficult
to calculate due to the general-purpose nature of AI technology. Unlike
ships or ballistic missiles, AI systems cannot be easily counted.
Nevertheless, even crude estimates of defense spending show that
military AI investments are nowhere near large enough to constitute an
arms race. An independent estimate by Bloomberg Government of U.S.
defense spending on AI identified \$5 billion in AI-related research and
development in fiscal year 2020, or roughly 0.7 percent of the
Department of Defense's over \$700 billion budget.15 The scale of
military AI spending, at least at present, is nowhere near large enough
to warrant the title of "arms race." ([Adding in private sector
spending, which constitutes the bulk of AI investment, would lead to
larger figures but would further belie the claim of an "arms" race since
most private sector AI investment is not in weapons]{.underline}.)

### 1NC \-- DEMOCRACY IMPACT

#### Democratic peace theory is [wrong]{.underline} --- democracy *[doesn't]{.underline}* eliminate conflicts. 

**Larison 12** --- Daniel Larison, Senior Editor at *The American
Conservative*, holds a Ph.D. in History from the University of Chicago,
2012 ("Democratic Peace Theory Is False," *The American Conservative*,
April 17^th^, Available Online at
http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/democratic-peace-theory-is-false/,
Accessed 08-11-2013)

Rojas' claim depends entirely on the meaning of "genuine democracy."
Even though there are numerous examples of wars between states with
universal male suffrage and elected governments (including that little
dust-up known as WWI), the states in question probably don't qualify as
"genuine" democracies and so can't be used as counter-examples.
Regardless, [[democratic peace theory draws]{.mark} **broad
[conclusions]{.mark}** [from **a short period in**]{.mark} **modern
[history]{.mark}** [with **very few cases** before the 20th
century]{.mark}]{.underline}. The core of democratic peace theory as I
understand it is that democratic governments are more accountable to
their populations, and because the people will bear the costs of the war
they are going to be less willing to support a war policy. This
supposedly keeps democratic states from waging wars against one another
because of the built-in electoral and institutional checks on government
power. One small problem with this is that it is rubbish. [[Democracies
in antiquity **fought against one another**. Political equality and
voting **do not abolish conflicts of interest**]{.mark} between
competing states. [D]{.mark}emocratic [p]{.mark}eace [t]{.mark}heory
[**doesn't account** for]{.mark} the effects of [nationalist]{.mark} and
[imperialist ideologies]{.mark} on the way democratic nations think
about war. Democratic nations that have professional armies to do the
fighting for them are often **enthusiastic** about overseas
wars]{.underline}. The Conservative-Unionist government that waged the
South African War (against two states with elected governments, I might
add) enjoyed great popular support and won a huge majority in the
"Khaki" election that followed. [As long as it goes well and doesn't
have too many costs, [war can be **quite popular**]{.mark}]{.underline},
and even if the war is costly it may still be popular if it is fought
for nationalist reasons that appeal to a majority of the public. If the
public is whipped into thinking that there is an intolerable foreign
threat or if they believe that their country can gain something at
relatively low cost by going to war, the type of government they have
really is irrelevant. Unless a democratic public believes that a
military conflict will go badly for their military, they may be ready to
welcome the outbreak of a war that they expect to win. Setting aside the
flaws and failures of U.S.-led democracy promotion for a moment, [[the
idea that reducing the number of non-democracies makes war less likely
is **just fantasy**. Clashing interests]{.mark} between states **[aren't
going away]{.mark}**, and [the more democratic states]{.mark} there are
in the world the [more likely]{.mark} it is that two or more of [them
will]{.mark} **eventually [fight one another]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

- Leaders just as bad, allows for authoritarians to rise, aggravate

[The U.S.]{.underline} government [should cease its]{.underline}
arrogant and [ill-informed attempts to promote democracy around the
globe]{.underline} --- whether in Cuba, Iraq, Afghanistan, Communist
China, Ukraine, Burma or otherwise. The attempts are extraneous to the
purposes of the United States Constitution. [[Democratically elected
leaders can be every bit as tyrannical and aggressive]{.mark} towards
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [[as]{.mark} unelected
[dictators. Hamas]{.mark},]{.underline} listed as an international
terrorist organization, decisively [[triumphed in Palestinian
parliamentary elections in 2006. I]{.mark}t has ruled in Gaza since
2007, routinely denies human rights, chronically attacks Israel, and
execrates the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [[Egypt's first
democratically elected president]{.underline}]{.mark}, Mohamed Morsi,
[[proved]{.mark}]{.underline} as much or [[more contemptuous of the rule
of law,]{.mark} human rights and amity towards Israel and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [than]{.underline} his
dictatorial predecessor, Hosni [Mubarak.]{.underline} Thus, the United
States shed only crocodile tears when he was overthrown in a military
coup. Adolf [[Hitler climbed to power through popular
elections.]{.underline}]{.mark} His Nationalist Socialists captured more
than 37 percent of the vote in 1932 to become the largest party in the
Reichstag. [Free]{.underline} and fair [[elections in Saudi Arabia would
yield victory for radical]{.mark} Islamic [parties]{.mark}]{.underline}
with affinity and sympathy for the murderous perpetrators of 9/11. In
sum, [[promoting democracy]{.mark} in foreign lands [may
aggravate]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than diminish [[threats
to]{.mark}]{.underline} perceived interests of [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates. Thus, we have
supported dictators over democrats in Iran, Guatemala, Chile, Indonesia,
Argentina, Bahrain, Kuwait, Cambodia, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Spain, the Philippines, ad infinitum. In any event[, [democracy
promotion]{.underline}]{.mark} [is overwhelmingly a fool's errand. The
process [is]{.mark}]{.underline} vastly [[too complex]{.mark} for us to
master or]{.underline} to [jump start]{.underline}. Sending nations
copies of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution will not do.
Words without a reinforcing political culture are worthless. Iraq's
Constitution prohibits laws that contradict the "principles of
democracy." But Salmon Rushdie would be killed if he attempted to sell
The Satanic Verses in Baghdad. We also forget that democracy in the
United States evolved over more than seven centuries. We cannot expect
more from other people. Anglo-American democracy was born with the Magna
Carta to check the absolutism of King John in 1215 on the fields of
Runnymede. Through succeeding centuries and periodic civil wars, the
powers of Parliament strengthened and the powers of the King diminished.
Landmarks included the Grand Remonstrance, the beheading of Charles I by
Oliver Cromwell, and the English Bill of Rights of 1688. American
colonists claimed the rights of British freemen. They soon took on the
trappings of democracy with the Virginia House of Burgesses, the
Mayflower Compact, the Connecticut Charter Oak, the Maryland Toleration
Act, etc. The United States Constitution was not drafted until 1787,
more than five centuries after Magna Carta. Democratic principles did
not completely triumph until the Civil War Amendments ending slavery and
enfranchising blacks, and the Women's Suffrage Amendment ending their
disenfranchisement in 1919. Blacks did not de facto enjoy the right to
vote until the Voting Rights Act of 1965, more seven and one-half
centuries since the road to democracy began at Runnymede. It was
facilitated in the United States by a literate society, a homogeneity of
ethnicity, culture and language, natural boundaries, and an
unprecedented array of profound and selfless leaders, for example,
George Washington and James Madison. [Despite]{.underline} these [vast
advantages, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates still [needed a
bloody Civil War and]{.underline} an obscenely prolonged period of [Jim
Crow before finally achieving substantial national unity]{.underline}
and racial justice. In light of our own seven-century journey to
democracy, [[the idea that we can install democratic
dispensations]{.mark} in nations that are [at the pre-Magna Carta stage
of political maturity]{.mark} and lacking our peculiar cultural
advantages [is delusional]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our miserable track
record speaks for itself, including South Vietnam, Iran, Iraq,
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Burma, South Sudan, Somalia, Syria, and
Bahrain. Taiwan moved into a democratic orbit in 1988 after the deaths
of dictators Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo, and South
Korea did the same after military strongman Chun Doo Hwan left office.
But these democratic movements were indigenous. The United States was
complacent with reliable, friendly, and anti-democratic leadership[. [At
best, democracy promotion is harmless]{.underline}]{.mark} [--- like
shouting at the weather. At worst, it is counterproductive.]{.underline}
Many societies are insufficiently mature, literate, and homogeneous to
for its practice. Democracy in these places degenerates into
majoritarian, sectarian, or tribal tyrannies notwithstanding formal
elections. Russia, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and South Sudan are emblematic.
[Democracy is given a bad name, which may handicap its return at a more
propitious tim]{.underline}

government's ability to wage war would make democracies less war-prone.
The data, however, reveal that [[democracies frequently go to war

studies of democratic peace for failing to define democracy clearly.
Moreover, he states that **[[shifting definitions of war have also made

#### 3. Democracy doesn't cause peace -- statistical models are spurious and don't assume economic growth

**Mousseau, 12**

(Michael -- Professor IR Koç University, "The Democratic Peace
Unraveled: It's the Economy" International Studies Quarterly, p 1-12)

Model 2 presents new knowledge by adding the control for economic type.
To capture the dyadic expectation of peace among contract-intensive
nations, the variable Contract- intensive EconomyL (CIEL) indicates the
value of impersonal contracts in force per capita of the state with the
lower level of CIE in the dyad; a high value of this measure indicates
both states have contract-intensive economies. As can be seen, the
coefficient for CIEL ()0.80) is negative and highly significant. This
corroborates that impersonal economy is a highly robust force for peace.
The coefficient for DemocracyL is now at zero. There are no other
differences between Models 1 and 2, whose samples are identical, and no
prior study corroborating the democratic peace has considered
contractintensive economy. Therefore, the standard econometric inference
to be drawn from Model 2 is the nontrivial result that **[[all prior
reports of democracy as a force for peace]{.mark} [are]{.mark} probably
[spurious]{.mark}, since [this result is]{.mark} predicted and [fully
accounted for by]{.mark} [economic norms]{.mark} theory.]{.underline}**
[CIEL and DemocracyL correlate only in the moderate range of
0.47]{.underline} (Pearson's r), [so the insignificance of democracy is
not likely to be a statistical artifact of
multicollinearity]{.underline}. This is corroborated by the variance
inflation factor for DemocracyL in Model 2 of 1.85, which is well below
the usual rule-of-thumb indicator of multicollinearity of 10 or more.
Nor should readers assume most democratic dyads have both states with
impersonal economies: While almost all nations with contract-intensive
economies (as indicated with the binary measure for CIE) are democratic
(Polity2 \> 6) (Singapore is the only long-term exception), more than
half---55%---of all democratic nation-years have contract-poor
economies. At the dyadic level in this sample, this translates to 80% of
democratic dyads (all dyads where DemocracyBinary6 = 1) that have at
least one state with a contract-poor economy. In other words, [not only
does [Model]{.mark} 2 [show **no evidence of causation from democracy to
peace**]{.mark}]{.underline} (as reported in Mousseau 2009), [but it
also illustrates that this absence of democratic peace includes the vast
majority]{.underline}---80%---[of democratic dyad-years over the sample
period]{.underline}. [[Nor is it likely]{.mark} that [the causal arrow
is]{.mark} [reversed]{.mark}---with democracy being the ultimate cause
of contract-intensive economy and peace]{.underline}. This is because
[correlations among independent variables are not calculated in the
results of multivariate regressions: Coefficients show only the effect
of each variable after the potential effects of the others are kept
constant]{.underline} at their mean levels. [If it was democracy that
caused both impersonal economy and peace, then there would be some
variance in DemocracyL remaining]{.underline}, after its partial
correlation with CIEL is excluded, that links it directly with peace.
[The positive direction of the coefficient for DemocracyL informs us
that [no such direct effect exists]{.mark}]{.underline} (Blalock
1979:473--474). Model 3 tests for the effect of DemocracyL if a control
is added for mixed-polity dyads, as suggested by Russett (2010:201). As
discussed above, to avoid problems of mathematical endogeneity, I adopt
the solution used by Mousseau, Orsun and Ungerer (2013) and measure
regime difference as proposed by Werner (2000), drawing on the
subcomponents of the Polity2 regime measure. As can be seen, the
coefficient for Political Distance (1.00) is positive and significant,
corroborating that regime mixed dyads do indeed have more militarized
conflict than others. Yet, the inclusion of this term has no effect on
the results that concern us here: CIEL ()0.85) is now even more robust,
and the coefficient for DemocracyL (0.03) is above zero.7 Model 4
replaces the continuous democracy measure with the standard binary one
(Polity2 \> 6), as suggested by Russett (2010:201), citing Bayer and
Bernhard (2010). As can be observed, the coefficient for CIEL ()0.83)
remains negative and highly significant, while DemocracyBinary6 (0.63)
is in the positive (wrong) direction. As discussed above, analyses of
fatal dispute onsets with the far stricter binary measure for democracy
(Polity = 10), put forward by Dafoe (2011) in response to Mousseau
(2009), yields perfect prediction (as does the prior binary measure Both
States CIE), causing quasi-complete separation and inconclusive results.
Therefore, Model 5 reports the results with DemocracyBinary10 in
analyses of all militarized conflicts, not just fatal ones. As can be
seen, the coefficient for DemocracyBinary10 ()0.41), while negative, is
not significant. Model 6 reports the results in analyses of fatal
disputes with DemocracyL squared (after adding 10), which implies that
the likelihood of conflict decreases more quickly toward the high values
of DemocracyL. As can be seen, [[the coefficient]{.mark} for DemocracyL
2 [is]{.mark} at [zero]{.mark}, further corroborating that [even very
high levels of democracy do not]{.mark} appear to [cause peace]{.mark}
in analyses of fatal disputes, [once consideration is]{.mark} [given
to]{.mark} contractintensive [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Models 3, 4,
and 6, which include Political Distance, were repeated (but unreported
to save space) with analyses of all militarized interstate disputes,
with the democracy coefficients close to zero in every case. Therefore,
the conclusions reached by Mousseau (2009) are corroborated even with
the most stringent measures of democracy, consideration of institutional
distance, and across all specifications: [The **[democratic peace
appears spurious]{.mark}**, [with]{.mark} contract-intensive [economy
being]{.mark} [the more likely explanation]{.mark} [for]{.mark} both
democracy and the [democratic peace]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Democratic wars There is considerable evidence that **[[the absence of
war claim is incorrect.]{.mark} As]{.underline}** Christopher
Laync(2001, p. 801) notes, \'The most damning indictment of [democratic
peace theory]{.underline}, is that it **[happens not to be
true]{.underline}**: **[democratic states have gone to war with one
another.\"]{.underline}** For example, [categorizing a state as
democratic if it achieves a democracy score of six or more in the Polity
dataset on regime type - as several analysts do - yields three
inter-dcmocratic wars: the American Civil War. the Spanish American War
and the Boer War]{.underline}/\' This is something defenders of the
theory readily admit - [adopting relatively inclusive definitions of
democracy, they themselves generate anywhere between a dozen and three
dozen cases of inter-democratic war. In order to exclude these anomalies
and thereby preserve the absence of war claim, the theory\'s defenders
restrict their definitions of democracy]{.underline}. In the most
compelling analysis to date, Ray (1993, pp. 256-9, 269) argues that no
two democracies have gone to war with one another as long as a democracy
is defined as follows: the members of the executive and legislative
branches arc determined in fair and competitive elections, which is to
say that at least two independent parties contest the election, half of
the adult population is eligible to vole and the possibility that the
governing party can lose has been established by historical precedent.
Similarly, Doyle (1983a, pp. 216-17) rescues the claim by arguing that
states\" domestic and foreign policies must both be subject to the
control of the citizenry if they are to be considered liberal. Russett,
meanwhile, argues that his no war claim rests on defining democracy as a
stale wilh a voting franchise for a substantial fraction of the
population, a government brought to power in elections involving two or
more legally recognized parties, a popularly elected executive or one
responsible to an elected legislature, requirements for civil liberties
including free speech and demonstrated longevity of at least three years
(Russett 1993, pp. 14-16). [Despite imposing these definitional
restrictions, [proponents of the democratic peace cannot exclude]{.mark}
up to five major wars, a figure which, if confirmed, would invalidate
the democratic peace by their own admission]{.underline} (Ray 1995, p.
27). [The first is [the War of 1812]{.mark} between Britain and the
United States]{.underline}. Ray argues that it does not contradict the
claim because Britain does not meet bis suffrage requirement. Yet this
does not make Britain any less democratic than the United States at the
time where less than half the adult population was eligible to vote. In
fact, as Laync (2001, p. 801) notes, \"the United States was not
appreciably more democratic than un re formed Britain.\" This poses a
problem for the democratic peace; if the United States was a democracy,
and Ray believes it was, then Britain was also a democracy and the War
of 1812 was an inter-democratic war. [The second case is [the American
Civil War]{.mark}.]{.underline} Democratic peace theorists believe the
United States was a democracy in 1861, but exclude the case on the
grounds that it was a civil rather than interstate war (Russett 1993,
pp. 16-17). However, a plausible argument can be made that the United
Stales was not a stale but a union of stales, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
thai this was therefore a war between states rather than within one.
Note, for example, that the term \"United States\" was plural rather
than singular at the time and the conflict was known as the \"War
Between the States.\"7 This being the case, the Civil War also
contradicts the claim.8 [[The Spanish-American and Boer wars]{.mark}
constitute two further exceptions to the rule]{.underline}. Ray excludes
the former because half of the members of Spain\'s upper house held
their positions through hereditary succession or royal appointment. Yet
this made Spain little different to Britain, which he classifies as a
democracy at the time, thereby leading to the conclusion that the
Spanish-American War was a war between democracies. Similarly, it is
hard to accept his claim that the Orange Free State was not a democracy
during the Boer War because black Africans were not allowed to vote when
he is content to classify the United States as a democracy in the second
half of the nineteenth century (Ray 1993. pp. 265, 267; Layne 2001. p.
802). In short, defenders of (he democratic peace can only rescue their
core claim through the selective application of highly restrictive
criteria. Perhaps [the most important exception is [World War I,]{.mark}
which, by virtue of the fact that [Germany fought against Britain,
France, Italy, Belgium and the United States]{.mark}, would count as
[five instances of war between liberal states]{.mark} in most analyses
of the democratic peace]{.underline}.9 As Ido Oren (1995, pp. 178-9) has
shown. Germany was widely considered lo be a liberal state prior to
World War I: \"Germany was a member of a select group of the most
politically advanced countries, far more advanced than some of the
nations that arc currently coded as having been \"liberal\' during that
period.\" In fact, Germany was consistently placed toward the top of
that group, \"either as second only to the United States \... or as
positioned below England and above France.\" Moreover, Doyle\*s
assertion that the case ought to be excluded because Germany was liberal
domestically, but not in foreign affairs, does not stand up lo scrutiny.
As Layne (1994, p. 42) points out. foreign policy was \"insulated from
parliamentary control\" in both France and Britain, two purportedly
liberal states (see also Mcarshcimcr 1990, p. 51, fn. 77; Layne 2001,
pp. 803 807). Thus it is difficult to classify Germany as non-liberal
and World War I constitutes an imporiant exception to Ihe finding. Small
numbers [[Even if restrictive definitions of democracy enable democratic
peace theorists to uphold their claim, they render it unsurprising by
reducing the number of democracies]{.mark} in any analysis]{.underline}.
As several scholars have noted, [[there were only a dozen]{.mark} or so
[democracies in the world prior to World War I]{.mark}, and even fewer
in a position to fight one another]{.underline}. Therefore, [since war
is a rare event for any pair of states, the fact that democracies did
not fight one another should occasion little surprise]{.underline}
(Mearsheimer 1990, p. 50; Cohen 1994, pp. 214, 216; Layne 1994, p. 39;
Henderson 1999, p. 212).10 It should be a source of even less surprise
as the number of democracies and the potential for conflict among them
falls, something that is bound to happen as the democratic bar rises.
Ray\*s suffrage criterion, for example, eliminates two great powers -
Britain and the United States - from the democratic ranks before World
War I. thereby making the absence of war between democracies eminently
predictable.\" A simple numerical example should serve to illustrate the
point. [Using a Polity score of six or more to designate a state as a
democracy]{.underline} yields 716 purely democratic dyads out of a total
23240 politically relevant dyads between 1816 and 1913. Assuming that
wars arc distributed according to the proportion of democratic dyads in
the population and knowing that there were 86 dyads at war during this
period, [we should expect to observe three democratic-democratic wars
between the Congress of Vienna and World War I.]{.underline} If we
actually observed no wars between democracies, the democratic peace
phenomenon might be worth investigating further even though the
difference between three and zero wars is barely statistically
significant.\" [Increasing the score required for a state to be coded as
a democracy to eight - a score that would make Britain democratic from
1901 onwards only and eliminate states like Spain and the Orange Free
State from the ranks of the democracies - makes a dramatic difference.
The number of democratic dyads falls to 171. and the expected number of
wars is now between zero and one]{.underline}. Now the absence of war
finding is to be expected. In short, **[[by adopting restrictive
definitions of democracy, proponents of the democratic peace render
their central claim wholly unexceptional]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In sum,
proponents of the democratic peace have unsuccessfully attempted to
tread a fine line in order to substantiate their claim that democracies
have rarely if ever waged war against one another. On the one hand,
[they admit that inter-democratic war is not an unusual phenomenon if
they adopt relatively inclusive definitions of democracy. On the other
hand, in their attempts to restrict the definition of democracy and
thereby save the finding they inadvertently make the absence of war
between democracies trivial.]{.underline}

Democratic Trend Analyses

[Not only can [the **numerical values** of democracy be used to
**discover**]{.mark} **global and regional**
[differences]{.mark}]{.underline} (see above),
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} also [to **[detect trends over
time]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Since Samuel Huntington wrote his seminal
book on the 'third wave' (Huntington 1991), [scholars have taken for
granted the **idea that several waves** of democratization have engulfed
**the world over time**]{.underline}. A wave of democracy was defined as
a series of transitions from nondemocratic to some democratic systems,
which are taking place in a certain period of time and which are
significantly more numerous than the trends in the opposite direction
(Huntington 1991: 15). It was argued that the first wave of democracy
started in the early nineteenth century when the majority of white males
got the right to vote in the USA. The second wave started after the
Second World War, while the third wave started in 1974. This third wave
was truly global as it affected not just countries in Europe (Portugal,
Spain, Greece) but also many countries in Latin America and Asia. When
the totalitarian communist ideology collapsed worldwide, countries in
Eastern Europe made the transition to democracy since the late 1980s,
followed by many countries in sub-Saharan Africa since the early 1990s.
When several dictatorships in the Middle East and North Africa
collapsed, scholars and journalists started to talk about the 'Arab
Spring' with a 'fourth wave of democratization'. These democratization
processes showed beginnings of transitions, but most of the openings
closed with inevitable pullbacks. Hence, there are no clear
democratization trends happening in this region, let alone a new wave of
democratization. While some scholars showed that it would be better to
talk about 'trendless fluctuations' (see, e.g., Doorenspleet 2000), the
dominant way of thinking still emphasizes global trends, linear moves
and worldwide waves. [Does democracy **still come in waves** and has the
**world become more democratic**]{.underline} (see, e.g., Fukuyama
1989)? [Or]{.underline}---on the other hand---[[has there been **a
rollback** with an increasing]{.underline}]{.mark} number of
**[[dictatorships]{.underline}]{.mark}** (see, e.g., Kagan 2008)? At the
moment, three different approaches can be distinguished in the
literature. The first approach is very optimistic, emphasizing the trend
that the world has become a democratic place to live in, particularly
since 1989. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, many former communist
countries started democratizing, not just in Eastern Europe but also in
Africa. Democratic government was becoming the norm, slowly but surely,
and many scholars believed the trend towards democracy all around the
world was unstoppable and irreversible. In 1989, Francis Fukuyama
published his very influential essay 'The End of History?' with the
central idea that sociocultural evolution of mankind ended with the
collapse of the last totalitarian systems and that the mankind was now
able to the final form of government: democracy. Fukuyama's idea was
that the Western values of capitalism and democracy had won against the
forces of communism. This was seen as the final victory. According to
this view, there was no alternative anymore, and thus, democracy would
automatically spread around the world. In empirical studies, scholars
showed a clear growth in democratic systems (e.g. Huntington 1991; Shin
1994; but see also Doorenspleet 2000; Levitsky and Way 2015). Not only
many academics, but also political leaders and policy makers embraced
this idea. They repeated this message of 'democracy optimism' and
launched international programmes to promote democracy everywhere (see,
e.g., Burnell 2011, 2013; Carothers 2011). The second view is recent and
very pessimistic, emphasizing that there are signs of an overall
rollback of democracy and a reverse wave, particularly since 2002 (see,
e.g., Diamond 2008; Puddington 2009, 2010).36 Articles with titles such
as 'authoritarian resilience' (Nathan 2003), 'authoritarian reversals'
(Svolik 2008), 'the democratic rollback' (Diamond 2008), 'the great
democracy meltdown' (Kurlantzick 2011), 'democracy's deepening
recession' (Diamond 2014) show that researchers have changed from being
overly optimistic to pretty pessimistic regarding democracy and
democratization around the world. Scholars described the last decade as
a period of democratic decline (Puddington 2009; Diamond 2015: 142),
during which global freedom has 'plummeted' (Kurlantzick 2011), and new
democracies have suffered from a 'powerful authoritarian undertow'
(Diamond 2008: 36). Within this second approach, scholars pointed out
that 'by the final years of the twentieth century, the measurements of
democratic progress in the world had essentially reached their peaks'
(Plattner 2014: 13), while the world is experiencing 'a mild but
protracted democratic recession' (Diamond 2015: 144). The recent reports
of the FH reflected this negative mood as well. According to scholars
who worked on these reports, the year 2006 was characterized by a
growing 'pushback against democracy' (Puddington 2007), followed by 2007
and 2008 which were years of democratic 'decline' (Puddington 2009),
while the democratic erosion had 'accelerated' in 2009 (Puddington
2010), resulting in global democracy being 'under duress' in 2010
(Puddington 2011). The Arab Spring brought some optimism, but thereafter
the FH warned again for a democratic 'retreat' in 2012 and an
'authoritarian resurgence' in 2013 (Puddington 2013, 2014). Some
scholars warned that 'we might in fact be seeing the beginning of the
end for democracy' (Battison 2011), while others predicted not just the
'end of the end of history', but also 'the return to the authoritarian
Great Powers' (Gat 2007). In summary, this second approach is a gloomy
one, at least vis-à-vis the condition democracy seems to be in nowadays.
The final view is cautious. On the one hand, scholars within this
approach acknowledge the existence of worldwide democratization trends
since the end of the nineteenth century, with a clear wave since 1989.
They also reject the idea of a global democratic recession since 2008.
In this sense, this approach is very similar to the first optimistic
view. Thomas Carothers (2009: 1), for example, argued that 'democracy
has not lost ground in the world overall' and he recommended a 'stepping
back from democratic pessimism'. On the other hand, this approach also
states that we need to shake off the excessive, unreasonable,
unrealistic democratic optimism of the early 1990s. Already in 2009,
scholars such as Carothers pointed out that 'democracy is certainly
troubled in many places, when viewed relative to where it was at the
start of this decade' (Carothers 2009: 1). Although there is no clear
reverse democratization wave, the number of democracies has not
increased anymore as was expected by the first approach. While a global
democratic recession is seen as a 'myth' (Levitsky and Way 2015),
scholars in this approach call this recent decade a period of
'stagnation' or 'an equilibrium' (Merkel 2010). Since 2002, the
worldwide competition between democracies and dictatorships should be
considered as 'frozen' (Merkel 2010). What is the empirical evidence?
When focusing on the long-term trends, the first approach can certainly
be supported by the figures and data. Not only since the end of the
nineteenth century, but certainly since the 1970s, has an impressive
number of countries made a transition to democracy (see Huntington 1991;
Doorenspleet 2000; Merkel 2010). A new wave of democratization seems to
be very unlikely though, and the recent period can better be described
as stable and stagnant, thereby supporting the third cautious approach.
There is certainly no evidence for the second, pessimistic approach, as
there are no clear signs of a reverse wave---at least not yet. During
the last decade, the level of freedom has declined in 105 countries, and
more countries suffered declines in freedom in 2015 compared to any of
the previous years (see also Puddington and Roylance 2016). However,
those declines can be mainly found among the nondemocratic, unfree
countries. Freedom is particularly waning in dictatorships such as
Azerbaijan, China, Iran and Russia (see Diamond 2015: 151). Moreover, in
2015, there were also more countries with increased freedom compared to
any year since 2007, suggesting that 'we are entering a period of
greater volatility for global freedom, with new possibilities for
improvements as well as for setbacks' (see Puddington and Roylance
2016). The second half of Table 2.3 shows [the **percentage** of
countries, classified as **'free', 'partly free' and 'not
free'**.]{.underline}37 [[There is]{.underline}]{.mark} little or [[no
evidence of a **democratic recession**.]{.mark} To the contrary, [the
world is **far freer today** than it was in]{.mark}]{.underline}
[19[**75**.]{.underline}]{.mark} Overall, [countries are **nowadays
considerably freer** than in 1990]{.underline}, while [[there has been
no **clear decline** since the mid- 2000s, which is]{.underline}]{.mark}
often [[seen as the beginning of the **democratic
recession**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Levitsky and Way 2015). An analysis of
the period between 1995 and 2005 shows that from the 'partly free
countries' roughly a similar number became 'free' on the one hand and
'not free' on the other hand (see also Merkel 2010: 28--29). There is a
small decline in free countries, as well as an increase in unfree
countries after 2005. Still, the number of 41.7% countries which can be
classified as 'free' in 2015 is very impressive compared to 25.3% free
countries 40 years earlier. If we rely on the Polity IV data instead of
the FH data, similar patterns can be detected. The upper half of Table
2.3 shows the percentages of different types of political systems over
time (1975--2015). This information shows that the proportion of
democracies has clearly increased since 1975, while the proportion of
dictatorships has clearly decreased. The proportion of hybrid systems
has remained quite stable at the global level (see also Fig. 2.1). [[If
we focus on the **overall proportion** of **democracies** ]{.mark}**in
the world**]{.underline}, the [[data suggest a **positive trend**
since]{.underline}]{.mark} 19**[[75]{.underline}]{.mark}** (supporting
the first view), [[with **stagnation** and **stability** since
2005]{.mark}]{.underline} (supporting the third view). [A [global
**democratic recession** or **backsliding** seems to be **an
exaggeration**, and 'can neither be **supported by figures** nor by
**arguments'**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Merkel 2010: 29); [[the second view
can thus be rejected as **a myth or illusion**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see
Levitsky and Way 2015). [[The average **level of democracy went
gradually up**]{.mark} from **−2.3 in 1975** to]{.underline} 2.6 in 1995
and [**4.3 in 2015**.]{.underline} Slowly but [[surely **a clear trend**
towards more democracy]{.mark} can **be seen after 1975**.]{.underline}
So [why have so **many scholars** recently supported the]{.underline}
second **[pessimistic approach?]{.underline}** [A first answer to this
question can]{.underline} probably [be found **in [the excessive
optimism]{.mark}** [after the fall of the Berlin Wall, expecting
**countries to become democratic** overnight]{.mark}]{.underline}, not
just in Eastern Europe but also in other parts of the world. The fall of
the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union generated a
widespread perception that liberal democracy was the 'only game in town'
(Linz and Stepan 1996). As Levitsky and Way (2015: 45--46) explained it
well, [those **'[early]{.mark} post--Cold War [transitions]{.mark}**
[generated **unrealistic expectations**]{.mark} that, when not realized,
[gave rise to exaggerated **pessimism and gloom**'. If dictatorships
went through **periods of crises**]{.mark}]{.underline} or instability,
then [[it was seen as **signs of democratization
processes**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but [[there is no
foundation]{.underline}]{.mark}---**[[neither theoretically nor
empirically]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[to assume **such an
outcome**]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is true that the collapse of a
dictatorship creates opportunities for democratization. Historically,
most [endings of **dictatorships** have not led to **democratization
though, let alone** a **stable democratic system**]{.underline} (Svolik
2012). Breakdowns may result in different outcomes, ranging from the
formation of a new dictatorship (e.g. Iran after 1979), or to state
collapse and anarchy (e.g. Libya after 2011). Sometimes, it generates a
transition to a minimal democracy (e.g. South Africa and Chile in the
early 1990s), but we should not assume that this will necessarily,
automatically happen. [[When]{.mark} the **[democratization]{.mark} boom
in [the 1990s]{.mark}** [is seen as an **exceptional phenomenon**,
the]{.mark} recent [developments around the world can **be assessed in a
more realistic way**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[not through **rose-tinted
glasses** anymore]{.underline}]{.mark}, but [with less expectations
regarding **successful transitions** to democracy.]{.underline} Such [a
**more realistic approach** would make us **less pessimistic** about
the]{.underline} recent [political **developments around the world**.
[The **excessive scholarly attention** to]{.mark} democratic
**developments in [the USA]{.mark}**]{.underline}, particularly
recently, [[might]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[explain the **current
pessimistic mood**]{.mark} around **democratic trends**.]{.underline}
This focus might be caused by the fact that **[[most
influential]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[and **highly
cited**]{.underline}---[[democracy scholars are]{.underline}]{.mark}
still [**[American]{.mark}** or based at **American
universities**]{.underline}, or [it might be caused by]{.underline} the
fact that [the USA is still seen as one of the **most important
democratic** world powers.]{.underline} Whatever the explanation, [it is
clear that **the pessimistic approach** emphasizes the increasing **lack
of democratic quality**]{.underline} [in established
democracies.]{.underline} Larry Diamond, for example, wrote that 'the
most worrisome dimension of democratic recession has been the decline of
democratic efficacy, energy, and self-confidence in the West, including
the United States' (Diamond 2015: 152). Lower popular trust in
government, decreasing rates of voter turnout and the receding of
democracy promotion as a priority of US foreign policy are all
'additional signs' of 'democratic ill health' according to this
approach, while 'the world takes note of all this' giving dictators
ammunition to 'discredit democracy in general and immunize authoritarian
rule against US pressure' (Diamond 2015: 152). While this might be true
to a certain extent, [[**this pessimistic approach** conflates the
analyses of the **proportion of democracies** around the
world]{.mark}]{.underline} on the one hand, [[with **democratic
quality**]{.underline}]{.mark} on the other hand. [There are **certainly
signs** that the democratic **quality of some established democracies**
is in decline]{.underline}; still, [[there is **no clear reverse trend**
with **numerous transitions** away from democracy]{.underline}]{.mark},
and in this regard, [the]{.underline} second [**pessimistic view**
cannot be **supported**. [Despite increasingly **unfavourable
conditions**]{.mark}]{.underline} in recent years---not just [[in
democracies **such as the USA**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but also globally,
[[the new democracies have **remained strikingly
robust**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Levitsky and Way 2015).

### 1NC---NO CLIMATE IMPACT

**No impact and alt causes**

The uncertainty that encompasses current climate change assessments is
strengthened in light of the studies indicating that [[over]{.mark}
earth\'s [history there have been]{.mark} **[distinct warm
periods]{.mark}** with temperatures **[exceeding]{.mark} the [current
ones]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Esper et al., 2012, McIntyre and
McKittrick, 2003 and Soon and Baliunas, 2003). [Reviewing the relevant
scientific literature, Khandekar, Murty, and Chittibabu
(2005]{.underline}) [concluded that "in the context of the earth\'s
climate through the last 500 million years, the
[recent]{.mark}]{.underline} (1975--2000) [[increase]{.mark} in the
earth\'s mean temperature [does not appear]{.mark} to be **unusual** or
**[unprecedented]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as claimed by IPCC and many
supporters of the global warming hypothesis]{.underline}" (p. 1568).
Other studies challenged the mainstream climate change narrative,
according to which CO2 levels in the earth\'s atmosphere play a
prominent role in rising temperatures. One notable example is the
research by Shaviv and Veizer (2003), which demonstrates that the
earth\'s temperature correlates well with variations in cosmic ray flux,
rather than changes in atmospheric CO2. These findings and others stir
contentious debates within the climate scientific community, but are
nevertheless largely overlooked by the IPCC, which ignores alternative
explanations for climate change. Regrettably, Hall et al. scornfully
dismiss this evidence, presented in our research note, based on
cherry-picking of a few "non-peer-reviewed" references that were cited,
some vague claims about "misreading" and "selective citing," as well as
other semantic nitpicking. 4. Impacts of climate change [The
[IPCC]{.mark} warns that climate change is likely to have severe
consequences, particularly for poor countries, such as increased hunger,
water shortages, vulnerability to extreme weather events and
debilitating diseases. **However**, these estimations have been
**[heavily criticized]{.mark}** [for failing to]{.mark} properly
[account for]{.mark} **substantial improvements in [adaptive
capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline} (i.e., the capability of coping with the
impact of global warming) [that are likely to occur due to advances in
**economic development**, **technological change** and **human capital**
over the next century]{.underline} (Goklany, 2007). [Fostering economic
growth and technological development, largely achievable through the use
of fossil fuels]{.underline}, [will strengthen both industrialized and
developing countries\' **adaptive capacity** to deal not just with
possible future climate change consequences, but also with other
environmental and public health problems]{.underline}. [Such policy will
**provide greater benefits** at lower costs than drastic climate change
mitigation efforts involving substantially cutting greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline} (Goklany, 2004 and Goklany, 2012). Furthermore,
the analyses of Galiana and Green (2009) exemplify that in the current
state of energy technologies, the suggested plans for ambitious emission
reductions will likely severely clobber the global economy, especially
in view of present economic conditions. In order to stabilize
atmospheric CO2 at accepted levels, there is a need for enormous
advances in efficient energy technology, which is currently missing
(Pielke, Wigley & Green, 2008). In any case, [[**even if** every
industrialized nation meets the most ambitious emissions targets]{.mark}
set by the Kyoto Protocol]{.underline}, [[such efforts are likely to
have **little effect**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [particularly [in the light
of the considerable increases in]{.mark} greenhouse gas [emissions
by]{.mark} rising economic superpowers as [**China** and
**India**]{.mark}, as well as the **remaining developing
world**]{.underline} (Wigley, 1998). Hall et al. criticized us for
choosing "selective citations...that discuss natural processes
potentially affect climate in specific locations and times." Yet the
purpose of referring to such studies was to refute the claims made by
the IPCC and other climate change alarmists to the effect that recent
extreme weather events (e.g., floods, droughts and storms) are the
consequences of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Moreover,
data shows that despite claims that the number and intensity of extreme
weather has increased, between 1900 and 2010 the average annual death
and death rates from extreme weather events has declined by 93% and 98%,
respectively (Goklany, 2009). This is mostly due to economic and
technological factors, such as improved global food production, increase
globalized food trade and better disaster preparedness. IPCC\'s
exaggerated estimations of climate change impacts were also noted in an
op-ed in Financial Times written by climate economist Richard Tol
(2014), a week following his demand that his name as one of the leading
authors be removed from the IPCC\'s AR5 due to its over alarmist
assessments of the impacts of AGW and underestimation of humanity\'s
adaptive capacity. As concluded by Tol, "[[Humans are]{.mark} a
**[tough]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[adaptable]{.mark}**
species]{.underline}. People live on the equator and in the Arctic, in
the desert and in the rainforest. [**[We survived ice ages]{.mark}**
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[primitive
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The idea that climate change poses
an existential threat to humankind is]{.underline}
**[laughable]{.underline}**" (2014, para 1).

As already noted, [the [IPCC scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline} themselves
**[[are wildly alarmist]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not only on the basic
science but also [on the]{.underline} **[underlying]{.underline}**
economic **[assumptions]{.underline}**, which in turn drive the alarmist
impacts. [The result]{.underline} [**[cannot withstand critical
analysis]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Economists Ian Castles and David
Henderson, for example, show the extent to which the analysis is driven
by the desire to reach predetermined outcomes.50 Other economists have
similarly wondered what purpose was served by pursuing such unrealistic
scenarios. It is hard to credit the defense put forward by Mike Hulme,
one of the creators of the scenarios, that the IPCC is not engaged in
forecasting the future but in creating "plausible" story lines of what
might happen under various scenarios.51 [[Each]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[scare [scenario]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[is]{.mark} based on linear
projections [without]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}**[any [reference
to]{.mark} technological developments or
[adaptation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If, on a similar linear basis, our
Victorian ancestors in the UK, worried about rapid urbanization and
population growth in London, had made similar projections, they would
have pointed to the looming crisis arising from reliance on horse-drawn
carriages and omnibuses; they would have concluded that by the middle of
the 20th century, London would be knee-deep in horse manure, and all of
the southern counties would be required to grow the oats and hay to feed
and bed the required number of horses. Technology progressed and London
adapted. **[Why should the rest of humanity not be able to do

storms, and cardiovascular incidents]{.underline}. As already noted
**[[there is no basis for the claim about severe-weather-]{.mark}related
threats or malnutrition]{.underline}**. The claim about heat-related
deaths gained a boost during the summer of 2003 because of the tragedy
of some 15,000 alleged heat-related deaths in France as elderly people
stayed behind in city apartments without air conditioning while their
children enjoyed the heat at the sea shore during the August vacation.
Epidemiological studies of so-called \"excess\" deaths resulting from
heat waves are abused to get the desired results. Similar studies of the
impact of cold spells show that they are far more lethal than heat waves
and that it is much easier to adapt to heat than to cold.53 More
fundamentally, this, like most of the alarmist literature, ignores the
basics of the AGW hypothesis: the world will not see an exponential
increase in summer, daytime heat (and thus more heat waves), but a
decrease in night-time and winter cooling, particularly at higher
latitudes and altitudes. Based on the AGW hypothesis, Canada, China,
Korea, Northern Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Chile, and
Argentina will see warmer winters and warmer nights. There are clear
benefits to such a development, even if there may also be problems, but
the AGW industry tends to ignore the positive aspects of their alarmist
scenarios. The feared [spread of malaria]{.underline}, a much repeated
claim, [is largely unrelated to climate]{.underline}. [Malaria's worst
recorded outbreak]{.underline} **[was in Siberia long before there was
any discussion of AGW]{.underline}**. Similarly, the building of the
Rideau Canal in Ottawa in the 1820s was severely hampered by outbreaks
of malaria due to the proximity of mosquito-infested wetlands in the
area. Malaria remains widespread in tropical countries today in part
because of the UN's lengthy embargo on the use of DDT, the legacy of an
earlier alarmist disaster. Temperature is but one factor, and a minor
one at that, in the multiple factors that affect the rise or decline in
the presence of disease-spreading mosquitoes. Wealthier western
countries have pursued public health strategies that have reduced the
incidence of the dis- ease in their countries. Entomologist Paul Reiter,
widely recognized as the leading specialist on malaria vectors and a
contributor to some of the early work of the IPCC, was aghast to learn
how his careful and systematic analysis of the potential impacts had
been twisted in ways that he could not endorse. In a recent paper, he
concludes: "Simplistic reasoning on the future prevalence of malaria is
ill-founded; malaria is not limited by climate in most temperate
regions, nor in the tropics, and in nearly all cases, 'new\' malaria at
high altitudes is well below the maximum altitudinal limits for
transmission. Future changes in climate may alter the prevalence and
incidence of the disease, but obsessive emphasis on 'global warming\' as
a dominant parameter is indefensible; the principal determinants are
linked to ecological and societal change, politics and economics."54

purely hypothetically but which has become one of the most persistent of
environmental urban myths. The fact is that [scientists]{.underline}
**[have no idea of the extent of the world\'s ﬂora and
fauna]{.underline}**, with estimates ranging from five million to 100
million species, and that [there are no reliable data about the rate of

ever existed have been lost over the eons]{.underline}, most before
humans became major players in altering their environment. A much more
credible estimate of recent species loss comes from a surprising source,
the UN Environmental Program. It reports that known **[species loss is
slowing reaching its lowest level in 500 years]{.underline}** in the
last three decades of the 20th century, with some 20 reported
extinctions despite increasing pressure on the biosphere from growing
human population and industrialization.57 The alarmist community has
also introduced the scientifically unknown concept of \"locally
extinct," often meaning little more than that [a species of plant or
animal has responded to adverse conditions by moving to more hospitable
circumstances]{.underline}, e.g., birds or butterflies becoming more
numerous north of their range and disappearing at its extreme southern
extent. Idso et al. conclude: "Many [[species have shown the ability

### 1NC---WARMING INEV

**Warming inevitable**

**McKibben, 16**---Schumann Distinguished Scholar at Middlebury College
(Bill, "Recalculating the Climate Math,"
<https://newrepublic.com/article/136987/recalculating-climate-math>,
dml) \[ableist metaphor modifications denoted by brackets\]

The future of humanity depends on math. And [the numbers in [a **new
study**]{.mark}]{.underline} released Thursday [are [the **most ominous
yet**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Those numbers spell out, in simple arithmetic, how much of the fossil
fuel in the world's existing coal mines and oil wells we can burn if we
want to prevent global warming from cooking the planet. In other words,
[[if our goal is]{.mark} to keep]{.underline} the Earth's [temperature
from]{.underline} rising more than [[two]{.mark}
[degrees]{.mark}]{.underline} Celsius---the upper limit identified by
the nations of the world---[[how much more]{.mark} new digging and
[drilling can we do?]{.mark}]{.underline}

Here's the answer: **[[zero]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

That's right: If we're serious about preventing catastrophic warming,
the new study shows, we can't dig any new coal mines, drill any new
fields, build any more pipelines. Not a single one. We're done expanding
the fossil fuel frontier. Our only hope is a swift, managed decline in
the production of all carbon-based energy from the fields we've already
put in production.

The new numbers are startling. Only four years ago, I wrote an essay
called "Global Warming's Terrifying New Math." In the piece, I drew on
research from a London-based think tank, the Carbon Tracker Initiative.
The research showed that the untapped reserves of coal, oil, and gas
identified by the world's fossil fuel industry contained five times more
carbon than we can burn if we want to keep from raising the planet's
temperature by more than two degrees Celsius. That is, if energy
companies eventually dug up and burned everything they'd laid claim to,
the planet would cook five times over. That math kicked off a widespread
campaign of divestment from fossil fuel stocks by universities,
churches, and foundations. And it's since become the conventional
wisdom: Many central bankers and world leaders now agree that we need to
keep the bulk of fossil fuel reserves underground.

But [the [new]{.mark}]{.underline} new [[math is]{.mark} **even [more
explosive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It draws on a report by Oil Change
International, a Washington-based think tank, using data from the
Norwegian energy consultants Rystad. For a fee---\$54,000 in this
case---Rystad will sell anyone its numbers on the world's existing
fossil fuel sources. Most of the customers are oil companies, investment
banks, and government agencies. But OCI wanted the numbers for a
different reason: to figure out how close to the edge of catastrophe
we've already come.

Scientists say that [to]{.underline} have even a two-thirds chance of
[stay]{.underline}ing [below]{.underline} a global increase of [two
degrees]{.underline} Celsius, [we can release **800** gigatons
more]{.underline} CO2 into the atmosphere. But the Rystad data shows
[coal mines and oil and gas wells **currently in
operation**]{.underline} worldwide [contain **942**
gigatons]{.underline} worth of CO2. So the math problem is simple, and
it goes like this:

942 \> 800

"What we found is that [[if you burn up]{.mark} all the [carbon]{.mark}
that's in the **[currently operating]{.mark} fields and mines**, [you're
**already above two degrees**]{.mark}]{.underline}," says Stephen
Kretzmann, OCI's executive director[. It's not that if we keep eating
like this for a **few more decades** we'll be]{.underline} ~~morbidly
obese~~ \[[doomed]{.underline}\]. [It's that if we eat **what's already
in the refrigerator** we'll be]{.underline} ~~morbidly obese~~
\[[doomed]{.underline}\].

What's worse, the definition of "morbid" has changed in the past four
years. [[Two degrees]{.mark} Celsius [used to be the red
line]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [[scientists now believe the]{.mark}
upper [limit is **much lower**.]{.mark} We've already raised the world's
temperature by one degree---enough to **melt almost half the ice** in
the Arctic, **kill off huge swaths of the world's coral**, and **unleash
lethal floods** and **drought**]{.underline}. July and August tied for
the hottest months ever recorded on our planet, and scientists think
they were almost certainly the hottest in the history of human
civilization. [Places]{.underline} like Basra, Iraq---on the edge of
what scholars think was the Biblical Garden of Eden---hit 129 degrees
Fahrenheit this year, [approaching the point where humans **can't
survive outdoors**]{.underline}. So last year, when the world's leaders
met in Paris, they set a new number: Every effort, they said, would be
made to keep the global temperature rise to less than 1.5 degrees. And
to have even a 50--50 chance of meeting that goal, we can only release
about 353 gigatons more CO2. So let's do the math again:

942 \> 353

### 2NC---WARMING INEV

**Past the tipping point---McKibben says [current fossil fuel
operations]{.underline} put us past 2 degrees, the threshold for
[irreversible]{.underline} warming.**

**They can't just blow this off and say it's try or die or "delay key to
adapting"---we're beating them on the [math]{.underline}---a [new
study]{.underline} says avoiding 2 degrees, which is
[higher]{.underline} than the threshold [they've set for
extinction]{.underline}, means we can emit a max of [800
gigatons]{.underline} of CO2 and [current operations]{.underline} are
set to burn [942]{.underline}.**

U.N. climate conferences have become increasingly irrelevant, in large
part because the approach taken is unworkable. International
negotiations have centered on placing the economic burden of addressing
climate change on a few dozen developed countries while asking little or
nothing from more the 150 developing countries. But [[the primary
source]{.mark} of GHG emissions [is]{.mark} **increasingly** the
developing world, most notably]{.underline} from large developing
economies such as [[China and India]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Even if the
U.S. cut **100 percent** of its CO2 emissions it would not make a
significant difference in projected global warming]{.underline}. [Using
the same climate sensitivity]{.underline} (which is arguably higher than
reality) [as the IPCC assumes in its modeling, [the world would only be
**0.137 degrees**]{.mark} Celsius [**cooler by 2100** if the U.S. cut
its CO2 emissions by **100 percent**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If the
entire industrialized world cut its CO2 emissions by 100 percent it
would avert warming by only 0.278 degrees Celsius]{.underline} by the
turn of the century.\[36\] Using the IPCC's own assumptions, [[to have a
meaningful impact]{.mark} on global temperatures]{.underline}, any
agreement [[would require]{.mark} significantly [reduced emissions
from]{.mark} both developed and [developing
countrie]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark}. [Such a course would be
**economically devastating**]{.underline}, however, [and
was]{.underline} one [reason why Canada pulled out of the Kyoto
Protocol, and why Japan, Russia, and Canada have said they would not
commit to a new treaty with binding commitments to reduce
emissions]{.underline}.\[37\] [Proponents]{.underline} of an
international agreement and the UNFCCC [point to China and India's
commitment to reduce CO2 emissions as evidence that the developing world
is serious about]{.underline} such [reductions]{.underline}. For
example, [China agreed to peak its GHG emissions by 2030. Non-binding
promises to cut emissions 14 years from now are a small price to pay for
continuing the status quo]{.underline}. In fact, [[China has been
**grossly underreporting**]{.mark} its [CO2 emissions and]{.mark} use of
[coal]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to a [November 2015 article from
The New York Times]{.underline}: [China, the world's leading emitter of
greenhouse gases from coal, has been burning up to 17 percent more coal
a year than the government previously disclosed]{.underline}, according
to newly released data. The finding could complicate the already
difficult efforts to limit global warming. Even for a country of China's
size, the scale of the correction is immense. [The sharp upward
revision]{.underline} in official figures [means]{.underline} that
[China has released]{.underline} much [more carbon dioxide---almost a
billion more tons a year]{.underline} according to initial
calculations---[than previously estimated]{.underline}.\[38\] [What are
the odds that China will be more forthright and transparent in the
future when accuracy could have an **actual impact?**]{.underline}
Further, [China's refusal to address its current severe **air** and
**water quality** problems,]{.underline} neither of which has anything
to do with reducing GHG emissions, [should raise serious concerns as to
whether China will follow through with any commitment]{.underline}.
[[China's improved standards of living have been accomplished
**through**]{.mark} the use of **[CO2-emitting]{.mark}** conventional
**[energy]{.mark}**.]{.underline} China's GDP per capita has increased
from a little more than \$300 in 1990 to nearly \$7,000 today.\[39\]
This growth is impressive, [but China's per capita GDP is still a
fraction of the developed world\'s]{.underline}. [Decarbonization would
**hinder** China's economic **growth**, which is why authorities have
resisted calls to restrict GHG emissions]{.underline} in previous
agreements. [China is unlikely to honor its promises in 2030 if it would
hamper continued economic growth]{.underline}. [[India's pledged cuts
are]{.mark} similarly **[dubious]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [India recently
vowed to cut its carbon intensity by 33 percent to 35 percent by
2030]{.underline}.\[40\] [However, roughly 22 percent of Indians still
do not have access to electricit]{.underline}y.\[41\] [[Domestic
political pressures to increase access to electricity and living
standards are going to be **far more** ]{.mark}**pressing than
international promises**]{.underline} to make GHG emissions cuts.
[Closer inspection]{.underline}, however, [reveals]{.underline} that
[[India]{.underline}]{.mark} has already incorporated this reality into
its pledge. [The [promised reductions are **not for CO2
emissions,**]{.mark} **but** for cuts in the ratio of CO2 emissions to
GDP, i.e., **emissions intensity**]{.underline}. [This ratio will go
down so long as CO2 emissions rise less rapidly than GDP]{.underline}.
For example, the carbon intensity of the U.S. economy dropped by more
than 45 percent between 1981 and 2011 even as CO2 emissions rose 18
percent.\[42\] [India's GDP is projected to rise from \$1.15 trillion in
2005]{.underline} (the base year for India's promised cuts) to \$6.9
trillion in 2030.\[43\] [Over the same span CO2 emissions are projected
to rise from 1.2 gigatons]{.underline} (Gt) to 3.8 Gt.\[44\] Simple
division shows that the CO2 intensity in 2005 was 1.05 Gt per trillion
dollars and that it is expected to drop to 0.577 Gt per trillion dollars
in 2030. Therefore[, projections for India's GDP and CO2 emissions
combine to predict that a **business-as-usual** scenario]{.underline}
(one without any policies beyond those currently in place) [will lead to
a 45 percent reduction in India's carbon intensity by 2030.]{.underline}
The promised cuts are 33 percent to 35 percent. In other words, if
[India does nothing at all, it is likely to more than meet its "bold
commitment.]{.underline}"

[[Reconstructions of Earth's past climate]{.mark} **[strongly
influence]{.mark}** [our understanding of]{.mark} the dynamics and
**[sensitivity]{.mark}** of the climate system]{.underline}. Yet global
temperature has been reconstructed for only a few isolated windows of

and continuous reconstructions across glacial cycles remain elusive.
[Here I present [a]{.mark} spatially weighted proxy [reconstruction

[reconstructions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Global temperature gradually
cooled until roughly 1.2 million years ago and cooling then stalled
until the present. The cooling trend probably stalled before the
beginning of the mid-Pleistocene
transition[3](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19798.html#ref3),
and pre-dated the increase in the maximum size of ice sheets around 0.9

Thus, global cooling may have been a pre-condition for, but probably is
not the sole causal mechanism of, the shift to quasi-100,000-year
glacial cycles at the mid-Pleistocene transition. Over the past 800,000
years, polar amplification (the amplification of temperature change at
the poles relative to global temperature change) has been stable over
time, and global temperature and atmospheric greenhouse gas
concentrations have been closely coupled across glacial cycles. [A

### 1NC---NO DISEASE IMPACT

#### Diseases don't cause extinction

Owen Cotton-**Barratt 17**, et al, PhD in Pure Mathematics, Oxford,
Lecturer in Mathematics at Oxford, Research Associate at the Future of
Humanity Institute, 2/3/2017, Existential Risk: Diplomacy and
Governance,

For most of human history, natural pandemics have posed the greatest
risk of mass global fatalities.37 However, there are some reasons to
believe that [[natural pandemics are]{.mark} **very [unlikely to
cause]{.mark} human [extinction]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Analysis of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
red list database has shown that [[of]{.mark} the [833]{.mark} recorded
plant and animal species [extinctions]{.mark} known to have occurred
since 1500, **[less than 4%]{.mark}** (31 species) [were ascribed to
infectious disease]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}38 [[None]{.mark} of
the mammals and amphibians on this list [were globally dispersed,
and]{.mark} [other factors]{.mark} aside from infectious disease also
[contributed]{.mark} to their extinction.]{.underline} [It]{.underline}
therefore [seems that [our]{.mark} own [species]{.mark}, which
[is]{.mark} **very numerous**[, **globally dispersed**, and capable of a
**rational response**]{.mark} **to problems**, is very unlikely to be
killed off by a natural pandemic[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

One underlying explanation for this is [that [highly lethal pathogens
can kill]{.mark} their [hosts before they]{.mark} have a chance to
[spread]{.mark}]{.underline}, so [[there is a **selective pressure for
pathogens not to be**]{.mark} **highly [lethal]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Therefore, pathogens are likely to co-evolve with their hosts rather
than kill all possible hosts.39

### 2NC---NO DISEASE IMPACT

#### Existential diseases are impossible- any disease that would have an 100% lethality rate would kill their hosts before it could spread, which creates evolutionary pressures for low lethality rates. Out of every extinction of both plants and animals only 4% are from diseases and none of those were globally dispersed like humans, which make burnout likely- that's Barret.

What is new is the possibility that science, bypassing evolution, will
enable monkeypox to be \"juiced up\" through gene splicing into a far
more lethal pathogen than smallpox ever was.

#### Absolutely no chance of extinction from disease

**Adalja 16** \[Amesh Adalja, infectious disease physician at the
University of Pittsburgh\] "Why Hasn\'t Disease Wiped out the Human
Race?" June 17, 2016
(http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/06/infectious-diseases-extinction/487514/) -
MZhu

But when people ask me if I'm worried about infectious diseases, they're
often not asking about the threat to human lives; they're asking about
the threat to human life. [With each outbreak of a headline-grabbing
emerging infectious disease comes a fear of extinction
itself]{.underline}. The fear envisions a large proportion of humans
succumbing to infection, leaving no survivors or so few that the species
can't be sustained.

I'm not afraid of this apocalyptic scenario, but I do understand the
impulse. [Worry about the end is a quintessentially human trait.
Thankfully, so is our resilience.]{.underline}

[For most of mankind's history, infectious diseases were the existential
threat to humanity---and for good reason. They were quite successful at
killing people]{.underline}: The 6th century's Plague of Justinian
knocked out an estimated 17 percent of the world's population; the 14th
century Black Death decimated a third of Europe; the 1918 influenza
pandemic killed 5 percent of the world; malaria is estimated to have
killed half of all humans who have ever lived.

[Any yet, of course, humanity continued to flourish. Our species' recent
explosion in lifespan is almost exclusively the result of the control of
infectious diseases **through sanitation, vaccination, and antimicrobial
therapies**]{.underline}. Only in the modern era, in which many
infectious diseases have been tamed in the industrial world, do people
have the luxury of death from cancer, heart disease, or stroke in the
8th decade of life. Childhoods are free from watching siblings and
friends die from outbreaks of typhoid, scarlet fever, smallpox, measles,
and the like.

[So **what would it take [for a disease to wipe out humanity]{.mark}
now?**]{.underline}

In Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain, the canonical book in the
disease-outbreak genre, an alien microbe threatens the human race with
extinction, and humanity's best minds are marshaled to combat the enemy
organism. Fortunately, outside of fiction, there's no reason to expect
alien pathogens to wage war on the human race any time soon, and [my
analysis suggests that any real-life domestic microbe reaching an
extinction level of threat probably is just as unlikely.]{.underline}

[Any apocalyptic pathogen would need to possess a very special
combination of two attributes. **First, [it would]{.mark} [have to be so
unfamiliar that no existing therapy or vaccine could be applied to
it]{.mark}**. **Second, [it would need]{.mark} to have a [high and
surreptitious transmissibility]{.mark} before symptoms occur**. The
first is essential because any microbe from a known class of pathogens
would]{.underline}, by definition, [have family members that could serve
as models for containment and countermeasures. The second would allow
the hypothetical disease to spread without being detected by even the
most astute clinicians.]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} three infectious [diseases most likely to be considered
extinction-level]{.mark} threats]{.underline} in the world
today---[influenza, HIV, and Ebola]{.underline}---[[don't meet
these]{.mark} two requirements. Influenza]{.underline}, for instance,
despite its well-established ability to kill on a large scale, its
contagiousness, and its unrivaled ability to shift and drift away from
our vaccines, [is still what I would call a "known
unknown."]{.underline} While there are many mysteries about how new flu
strains emerge, from at least the time of Hippocrates, [humans have been
attuned to its risk. And in the modern era, **a full-fledged industry of
influenza preparedness exists**, with effective **vaccine** strategies
and **antiviral** therapies.]{.underline}

[HIV]{.underline}, which has killed 39 million people over several
decades, [is similarly limited]{.underline} due to several factors.
[Most importantly, HIV's dependency on]{.underline} blood and [body
fluid for transmission (similar to Ebola) requires **intimate
human-to-human contact, which limits contagion**. Highly potent
antiviral therapy allows most people to live normally with the disease,
and a substantial group of the population has **genetic mutations that
render them impervious** to infection in the first place. Lastly,
**simple prevention strategies** such as needle exchange for injection
drug users and barrier contraceptives---when available---**can curtail
transmission risk**.]{.underline}

[Ebola, for many of the same reasons as HIV]{.underline} as well as
several others, [also falls short of the mark.]{.underline} This is
especially due to the fact that [it spreads almost exclusively through
people with easily recognizable symptoms, plus the taming of
its]{.underline} once unfathomable 90 percent [mortality rate by simple
supportive care.]{.underline}

[Beyond those three, every other known disease falls short]{.underline}
of what seems required to wipe out humans---which is, of course, why
we're still here. And it's not that diseases are ineffective. On the
contrary, diseases' failure to knock us out is a testament to just how
resilient humans are. [Part of our evolutionary heritage is [our immune
system]{.mark}, one of the most complex on the planet, [even
**without**]{.mark}]{.underline} the benefit of **[[vaccines
or]{.underline}]{.mark}** the helping hand of antimicrobial
[**[drugs]{.mark}**. This system]{.underline}, when viewed at a species
level, [**[can adapt to almost any enemy imaginable]{.mark}**. [Coupled
to **genetic variations**]{.mark}]{.underline} amongst humans---[which
open up the possibility for]{.underline} a range of advantages, from
[imperviousness to]{.underline} infection to [a tendency for mild
symptoms---this adaptability ensures that **[almost any infectious
disease onslaught will leave a large proportion of the population
alive]{.mark} to rebuild**,]{.underline} in contrast to the fictional
Hollywood versions.

While the immune system's role can never be understated, [an even more
powerful protector is the faculty of
**[consciousness]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Humans are not the most
prolific, quickly evolving, or strongest organisms on the planet, but as
Aristotle identified, **[humans are the rational
animals]{.underline}**---and it is this fundamental distinguishing
characteristic that allows humans to form abstractions, think in
principles, and plan long-range. [These capacities, in turn, [allow
humans]{.mark} to modify, **alter**, and improve themselves and their
environments. Consciousness equips us]{.underline}, at an individual and
a species level, [[to make nature safe]{.mark}]{.underline} for the
species through such technological marvels as antibiotics, antivirals,
vaccines, and sanitation. When humans began to focus their minds on the
problems posed by infectious disease, human life ceased being nasty,
brutish, and short. In many ways, human consciousness became infectious
diseases' worthiest adversary.

In 2003 a doctor with SARS [unknowingly infected several
guests](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92462/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK92462.pdf)
while staying at a Hong Kong hotel, and overnight the virus reached
across the globe. China is currently battling a bird flu that [kills
nearly half of the people
infected](https://www.statnews.com/2017/02/28/bird-flu-surge/). If
Ebola, which transmits through fluids, were spread by air, or if Zika,
which [has reached over 50
countries,](https://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/active-countries.html) were as
deadly as Ebola, we would be facing an unprecedented catastrophe. An
uncontrolled outbreak or bioterror attack could result in a [contagion
that kills over 30 million
people](https://www.securityconference.de/en/media-library/munich-security-conference-2017/video/panel-discussion-health-security-small-bugs-big-bombs/).
We fear it is only a matter of time before we face a deadlier and more
contagious pathogen, yet [the threat of a deadly pandemic remains
dangerously overlooked. [Pandemics now occur with greater
frequency]{.mark}, due to factors such as climate change, urbanization,
and international travel. **Other [factors, such as a weak W]{.mark}orld

[stand to deepen our vulnerability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [We also face
the specter of novel and mutated pathogens that could spread and kill
faster than diseases we have seen before.]{.underline} With the advent
of genome-editing technologies, bioterrorists could artificially
engineer new plagues, a threat that Ashton Carter, the former U.S.
secretary of defense, thinks could [rival nuclear weapons in
deadliness](https://www.wired.com/2017/02/former-secretary-defense-outlines-future-warfare/).
The two of us have advised the president of Guinea on stopping Ebola. In
addition, we have [worked on ways to contain the spread of
Zika](http://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.j379) and have informally
advised U.S. and international organizations on the matter. Our
experiences tell us that the world is unprepared for these threats. [[We
urgently need to change this trajectory]{.mark}.]{.underline} We can
start by learning four lessons from the gaps exposed by the Ebola and
Zika pandemics. [**Faster Vaccine Development** [The most effective way
to stop pandemics is with vaccines]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, with
Ebola there was no vaccine, and only now, years later, [has one proven
effective](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/health/ebola-vaccine.html).
This has been the case with Zika, too. Though there has been [rapid
progress](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/business/testing-the-limits-of-biotech-in-the-race-for-a-zika-vaccine.html)
in developing and getting a vaccine to market, it is not fast enough,
and Zika has already spread worldwide. [Many other diseases do not have
vaccines, and developing them takes too long when a pandemic is already
under way.]{.underline} We need faster pipelines, such as the one that
the [Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness
Innovations](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1613577) is
trying to create, to preemptively develop vaccines for diseases
predicted to cause outbreaks in the near future. **[Point-of-Care
Diagnostics]{.underline}** Even with such efforts, [[vaccines will not
be ready for many diseases]{.mark} and would not even be an option for
novel or artificially engineered pathogens]{.underline}. With no vaccine
for Ebola, our [next best
strategy](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2961696-2/fulltext)
was to identify who was infected as quickly as possible and isolate them
before they infected others. Because Ebola's symptoms were identical to
common illnesses like malaria, diagnosis required laboratory testing
that could not be easily scaled. As a result, many patients were only
tested [after several days of being contagious and infecting
others](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1411100#t=article).
Some were never tested at all, and about 40% of patients in Ebola
treatment centers [did not actually have
Ebola](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm63e1114a1.htm). [Many
dangerous pathogens similarly require laboratory testing that is
difficult to scale.]{.underline} Florida, for example, has not been able
to expand testing for Zika, so [pregnant women wait weeks to know if
their babies might be
affected](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/us/zika-test-delays-florida-pregnant.html).
[[What's needed are point-of-care diagnostics that]{.mark}, like
pregnancy tests, [can be used by frontline responders or patients
themselves to detect infection right away,]{.mark} where they
live.]{.underline} These tests already exist for many diseases, and the
technology behind them is well-established. However, the process for
their validation [is slow and
messy](https://hbr.org/2016/08/the-fight-against-zika-cant-wait-for-a-vaccine).
Point-of-care diagnostics for Ebola, for example, were available but
[never used because of such
bottlenecks](http://www.nature.com/news/researchers-frustrated-by-failure-to-roll-out-game-changing-ebola-test-1.17862).
[**Greater Global Coordination** [We need stronger global
coordination]{.mark}. The responsibility for controlling pandemics is
fragmented, spread across too many players with no unifying
authority.]{.underline} In Guinea we forged a response out of an amalgam
of over 30 organizations, each of which had its own priorities. [In
Ebola's aftermath, there have been [calls for a
mechanism](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1502918#t=article)
for responding to pandemics similar to the advance planning and training
that NATO has in place for its numerous members to respond to military
threats in a quick, coordinated fashion.]{.underline} This is the right
thinking, but we are far from seeing it happen. [[The errors that
allowed Ebola to become a crisis replayed with Zika, and the
WHO]{.mark}, which should anchor global action, [[continues to suffer
from a lack of
credibility](http://gh.bmj.com/content/1/2/e000047).]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**Stronger Local Health Systems** [International actors]{.mark} are
essential but [cannot parachute into countries and navigate local
dynamics]{.mark} quickly enough to contain outbreaks]{.underline}. **[In
Guinea it took months to establish the ground game needed to stop the
pandemic, with Ebola continuing to spread in the
meantime]{.underline}**. [[We need to help developing countries
establish health systems that can provide routine care]{.mark} and, when
needed, coordinate with international responders to contain new
outbreaks.]{.underline} [Local health systems could be established for
[about half of the \$3.6
billion](https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/pdf/cost-response.pdf) ultimately
spent on creating an Ebola response from scratch]{.underline}. Access to
routine care is also essential for knowing when an outbreak is taking
root and establishing trust. For months, Ebola spread before anyone knew
it was happening, and then lingered because communities who had never
had basic health care [doubted the intentions of
foreigners](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1508413#t=article)
flooding into their villages. The [turning
point](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/world/as-ebola-ebbs-in-africa-focus-turns-from-death-to-life.html)
in the pandemic came when they began to trust what they were hearing
about Ebola and understood what they needed to do to halt its spread:
identify those exposed and safely bury the dead. With Ebola and Zika, we
lacked these four things --- vaccines, diagnostics, global coordination,
and local health systems --- which are still urgently needed. However,
[prevailing political headwinds in the United States, which has played a
key role in combatting pandemics around the world, threaten to make
things worse. The **[Trump administration is seeking drastic budget cuts

cuts](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/trump-s-2018-budget-will-squeeze-civilian-science-agencies).
[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has been [at the

remains [without a
director](http://www.vox.com/2017/3/4/14803596/trump-pandemic-response-global-health-cdc),
and, if the Affordable Care Act is repealed, would lose [\$891 million,
12% of its overall
budget](https://www.statnews.com/2017/03/07/cdc-budget-obamacare-repeal/)]{.underline},

Investing in our ability to prevent and contain pandemics through
revitalized national and international institutions should be our shared
goal. However, [[if U.S. agencies become less able to respond to
pandemics]{.mark}, leading institutions from other nations, such as
[Institut Pasteur](https://www.pasteur.fr/en) and the [National
Institute of Health and Medical Research](http://english.inserm.fr) in
France, the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.ac.uk) and [London School

[nongovernmental organizations]{.mark}]{.underline} (NGOs have done
[instrumental
research](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2961042-X/fulltext)
and [response
work](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/our-work/medical-issues/epidemics)
in previous pandemics), [[would need to step in to fill the
void]{.mark}.]{.underline} There is no border wall against disease.
Pandemics are an existential threat on par with climate change and
nuclear conflict. We are at a critical crossroads, where we must either
take the steps needed to prepare for this threat or become even more
vulnerable. It is only a matter of time before we are hit by a deadlier,
more contagious pandemic. Will we be ready?

### 2NC---ALT CAUSES

#### Trump's budget cuts are an alt cause to failed disease response

WASHINGTON --- President Trump has promoted his first budget proposal as
placing one mission above all else --- keeping America safe. But [the
president has drawn a narrow definition of national security, and one
aspect of defense would actually receive less money: protecting the
nation from deadly pathogens, man-made or natural]{.underline}. **[[To
help offset a 10 percent increase in military spending, much of the
government would take serious hits, including agencies tasked with
biosecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The Office of Public Health
Preparedness and Response]{.mark}, which tracks outbreaks of disease,
[would be cut by \$136 million]{.mark}, or 9.7 percent.]{.underline}
[The National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious
Diseases]{.underline} --- a branch of the [Centers for Disease Control
and
Prevention](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org)
that fights threats like
[anthrax](http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/anthrax/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier)
and Ebola --- [would be cut by \$65 million, or 11 percent.]{.underline}
**[[The C.D.C.'s Center for Global Health would lose \$76 million, or 18
percent]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Its Emergency Operations Center, which
conducts real-time monitoring of outbreak responses, and its Select
Agents Program, which sets regulations in lethal toxin labs and helps
researchers stay ahead of bioterrorists, face unspecified cuts as well.
[[Experts in biological threats are reacting with
alarm]{.mark}.]{.underline} ["It's horrific --- worse than I expected,"
says J. Stephen Morrison, the director of the Global Health Policy
Center at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies]{.underline}. "They're just gutting things, overlaying salt upon
key institutions, with devastating human impact." "When you add those
cuts up," he added, they "will inevitably impact health security."
Republicans in Congress are no less critical. "Sometime in the
president's term, you will have a pandemic," Representative Tom Cole,
Republican of Oklahoma, told the president's budget director, Mick
Mulvaney, at a House budget hearing on Wednesday. "You will have a
[Zika](http://www.nytimes.com/news-event/zika-virus?inline=nyt-classifier),
you will have an Ebola," Mr. Cole said. "Cutting the Centers for Disease
Control, I think, leaves you very vulnerable and the American people
very vulnerable," he said. Over all, the C.D.C.'s budget would be cut 17
percent. Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, who recently retired as the director of
the C.D.C. and led its 2014 Ebola response, sent more than a dozen
bullet points [on Twitter last
week](https://twitter.com/DrFrieden/status/866983723857793024)
cataloging how the proposed budget was "Unsafe at Any Level Of
Enactment." Trump administration officials say they are trying to
refocus scientific research in an era of domestic austerity. Too much
federal science is competing with work that could be done in the private
sector, they say. Under the president's budget, the [National Institutes
of
Health](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_institutes_of_health/index.html?inline=nyt-org)
at large would be cut 18 percent. Within that, the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which handles Zika, Ebola and
[H.I.V.](http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier)/AIDS
vaccine research, would lose 18 percent of its budget. "The
administration wholeheartedly believes in the commitment to research,"
Mr. Mulvaney said Wednesday at the House budget hearing. "We'd like to
see more focus on what they call basic research, which is research
further away from the marketability of products because that is one of
the gaps that the government can and should fill." [The targeting is
remarkably specific. At the N.I.H., the Fogarty International Center, a
small program that in part trains foreign leaders in pandemic response,
would be eliminated.]{.underline} Thousands of scientists and global
health professionals rallied on Capitol Hill in April to protest the
plan after a list of programs targeted for eradication was released.
"They're making a very radical statement," Dr. Morrison said. "The big
picture is a movement toward suspicion of international programs. The
administration is threatening to abandon multilateralism in a big way."
Global health programs at the State Department and the United States
Agency for International Development would be cut by at least a quarter.
"Our operations must become more efficient, and our assistance must
become more effective," Hari Sastry, the director of the State
Department's Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources, told reporters
on Tuesday. "Our primary mission is going to remain advocating for the
national interests of our country." Military and border patrol spending
will increase, if Mr. Trump's request is funded. [But scientists warn
that [a \$1.6 billion project to begin constructing a southern border
wall will not keep out the most lethal outbreak of [bird
flu](http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/avian-influenza/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier)
in history, which recently killed 40 percent of patients in China, nor
will it keep out Ebola]{.mark}, which has resurfaced in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, with 37 suspected cases this month. "The next weapon
of mass destruction may not be a bomb," said [Lawrence O.
Gostin](http://www.law.georgetown.edu/oneillinstitute/faculty/Lawrence-Gostin.cfm),
the director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Center on
Public Health Law and Human Rights. "It may be a tiny pathogen that you
can't see, smell or taste, and by the time we discover it, it'll be too
late,"]{.underline} Mr. Gostin said. "The closed-border, highly
nationalistic, America-first vision is not the world's scientific view
of how to keep a population safe and healthy," he said. The president's
requests on biomedical research and defense are likely to be greeted
skeptically by Congress, which ultimately controls spending levels.
Lawmakers in both parties have greatly increased funding for the N.I.H.
budget, and Georgia's two senators, both Republicans, have protected the
C.D.C. and its Atlanta headquarters. Senator John McCain, Republican of
Arizona, called the Trump proposal "dead on arrival." And in the House
budget hearing on Wednesday, Mr. Cole pressed Mr. Mulvaney on proposed
cuts to the disease surveillance program.

### 1NC -- NO PROLIF IMPACT

#### No impact to nuclear proliferation---more nuclear states produce peace

**Suzuki 15** -- (June 2015, Akisato, Researcher, Institute for
International Conflict Resolution and Reconstruction, School of Law and
Government, Dublin City University, MA in Violence, Terrorism and
Security at Queen\'s University, "Is more better or worse? New empirics
on nuclear proliferation and interstate conflict by Random Forests,"
Research and Politics, SagePub)

Random Forests has three attractive and distinctive characteristics for
the purposes of this paper: first, the estimation of conditional
variable importance and partial dependence plots enable conventional
applied researchers to interpret non-parametric analysis in an intuitive
way; second, [[Random Forests]{.mark} can [examine
non-linearity]{.mark}]{.underline} (Strobl et al., 2009: 339--341),
[which is desirable because]{.underline}, as already noted, [some
theories expect non-linearity between nuclear proliferation
and]{.underline} a systemic [propensity for conflict]{.underline}; and
[finally]{.underline}, [[it can cope with]{.mark} potential
[interactions and multicollinearity between
regressors]{.mark}]{.underline} (Strobl et al., 2009: 339--341; Strobl
et al., 2008). As noted before, [most]{.underline} of the [regressors
here are highly correlated, and]{.underline} also [it is plausible to
anticipate some interaction]{.underline} effect between them
([e.g.]{.underline} the number of [democratic states and]{.underline}
the **[g]{.underline}**ross **[w]{.underline}**orld
**[p]{.underline}**roduct). **[The specific capabilities of Random
Forests are therefore essential]{.underline}**. The estimation of
conditional variable importance shows that the nuclear year counter has
a negative importance score.7 Thus, the nuclear year counter is not
important in explaining the dispute--state ratio. This suggests that the
optimist theory is supported. The remaining regressors have an
importance score higher than the absolute value of the importance score
of the nuclear year counter, meaning that they are all important.
Controlling for democratic peace, capitalist peace, and polarity, the
number of nuclear states is still a significant predictor in explaining
a systemic propensity for interstate conflict. Figure 1 presents the
partial dependence plots of the model.8 First, on average, a larger
number of nuclear states is associated with a lower dispute--state
ratio, although the changes from two nuclear states to three and from
six to seven increase the ratio instead. Thus, **[[the relationship is
empirically non-linear]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as Bueno de Mesquita and
Riker (1982) and Intriligator and Brito (1981) expected in part.
[[Overall]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[the optimist theory is
supported]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the [change]{.mark} from two nuclear
states to nine nuclear states **[decreases the dispute--state
ratio]{.mark}**]{.underline} approximately from 0.228 to 0.18. This
means that, if there are 194 states in the system (as there were in
2009), [[the number of militarized interstate dispute]{.mark} onsets per
system-year [decreases]{.mark}]{.underline} approximately from 44 to 35.
**[This is a substantively significant decline.]{.underline}** Second,
the nuclear year counter shows a concave relationship with the
dispute--state ratio, suggesting that new nuclear states are less prone
to conflict than middle-aged nuclear states. Thus, **[[the pessimist
theory finds no support]{.underline}]{.mark}** [from either]{.underline}
the [variable importance estimation or the partial dependence
plot]{.underline}. Finally, as for the control variables, the number of
democratic states and the gross world product have a complex non-linear
relationship with the dispute--state ratio, but [if the number of
democratic states and the **g**]{.underline}ross **[w]{.underline}**orld
**[p]{.underline}**roduct [are sufficiently large, they]{.underline}
tend to [decrease the dispute--state ratio]{.underline}.
[Their]{.underline} substantive [effects are]{.underline} also
[**significant**, though **not as much as the number of nuclear
states**.]{.underline} When comparing the effect of their lowest and
highest values (23 and 94 in the number of democratic states and 7 and
71.2 in the gross world product), the number of democratic states
decreases the number of militarized interstate dispute onsets per
system-year approximately from 40 to 37, and the gross world product
from 44 to 37. [Unipolarity is also associated with a
decline]{.underline} in the dispute--state ratio, suggesting that
unipolarity is better than bipolarity in terms of a systemic propensity
for interstate conflict; **[however, [its effect is
negligible]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as it reduces the number of
militarized interstate dispute onsets per system-year from 39 to 38. One
caveat is, as explained in the online appendix, that the results of the
number of democratic states and unipolarity are significantly sensitive
to a parameter setting. Thus, these predictors are less robust, and the
aforementioned points about them should be treated with caution.
Discussion and concluding remarks **[The main findings reveal that [the
optimist expectation]{.mark} of the relationship between nuclear
proliferation and interstate conflict [is empirically
supported]{.mark}]{.underline}**:9 first, a larger number of nuclear
states on average decreases the systemic propensity for interstate
conflict; and second, [[there is **no**]{.mark} **clear
[evidence]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} the emergence of [new nuclear states
increases]{.mark} the systemic propensity for interstate
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. Gartzke and Jo (2009) argue that
**[[nuclear weapons themselves have no exogenous effect on the
probability of conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**, because when a state is
engaged in or expects to engage in conflict, it may develop nuclear
weapons to keep fighting, or to prepare for, that conflict. If this
selection effect existed, [[the analysis]{.mark} should [overestimate
the conflict-provoking effect of nuclear proliferation]{.mark} in the
above model]{.underline}. Still, the results indicate that a larger
number of nuclear states are associated with fewer disputes in the
system. [This conclusion]{.underline}, however, [raises questions about
how to reconcile this study's findings with those of a recent
quantitative dyadic-level study]{.underline} (**[Bell and
Miller]{.underline}**, 2015). The current paper finds that nuclear
proliferation decreases the systemic propensity for interstate conflict,
while Bell and Miller (2015) find that nuclear symmetry has no
significant effect on dyadic conflict, but that nuclear asymmetry is
associated with a higher probability of dyadic conflict. [[It is
possible]{.mark} that nuclear [proliferation decreases conflict
through]{.mark} the conflict-mitigating effects of extended nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark} and/or fear of nuclear states' intervention, to the
extent that these effects overwhelm the conflict-provoking effect of
nuclear--asymmetrical dyads]{.underline}. Thus, **[[dyadic-level
empirics cannot]{.mark} solely [be relied on]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to
infer **causal links**]{.underline}]{.mark} between nuclear
proliferation and a systemic propensity for conflict. The
**[[systemic]{.mark}-level [empirics deserve
attention]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

threats]{.underline}. For the most part, [nuclear powers have found the
weapons to be a notable waste of time, money, effort, and scientific
talent]{.underline}. They have quietly kept the weapons in storage and
haven't even found much benefit in rattling them from time to time. If
the recent efforts to keep Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons have been
successful, those efforts have done Iran a favor. There has never been a
militarily compelling reason to use nuclear weapons, particularly
because it has not been possible to identify suitable targets---or
targets that couldn't be attacked as effectively by conventional
munitions. Conceivably, conditions exist under which nuclear weapons
could serve a deterrent function, but there is little reason to suspect
that they have been necessary to deter war thus far, even during the
Cold War. The main Cold War contestants have never believed that a
repetition of World War II, whether embellished by nuclear weapons or
not, is remotely in their interests. Moreover, the [[weapons have not
proved to be crucial status symbols]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[How much
more status would Japan have if it possessed]{.mark} nuclear
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}? [[Would anybody pay]{.mark} a great deal
[more attention]{.mark} to Britain or France [if]{.mark} their [arsenals
held 5,000]{.mark} nuclear weapons, [or]{.mark} much less if they had
[none]{.mark}]{.underline}? [Did China need nuclear weapons to impress
the world with its economic growth or its Olympics]{.underline}? Those
considerations help explain why **[[alarmists have been wrong for
decades]{.mark} about the pace]{.underline}** [of nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}. Most famously, in the 1960s, President John
[Kennedy anticipated that in another decade "fifteen or twenty or
twenty-five nations may have these weapons]{.underline}." Yet, [[of the
dozens of]{.mark} technologically [capable countries]{.mark} that have
considered obtaining nuclear arsenals, very [few have done
so]{.mark}.]{.underline} Insofar as most [leaders]{.underline} of most
countries (even rogue ones) have considered acquiring the weapons, they
[have come to appreciate several drawbacks]{.underline} of doing so:
[nuclear weapons are dangerous, costly, and likely to rile the
neighbors]{.underline}. Moreover, as the University of Southern
California's Jacques [Hymans]{.underline} has
[demonstrated]{.underline}, [the [weapons have]{.mark} also [been
exceedingly difficult]{.mark} for administratively dysfunctional
countries [to obtain]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[it took decades for North
Korea and Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark} to do so. In consequence,
**[[alarmist predictions about]{.mark} proliferation chains,
[cascades]{.mark}, dominoes, waves, avalanches, epidemics, and [points
of no return have proved faulty.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Although
[[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}eration [[has]{.mark} so far [had little
consequence]{.mark}, that is [not because]{.mark} the only
[countries]{.mark} to get nuclear weapons [have had rational
leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Large, important countries that acquired
the bomb were run at the time by unchallenged]{.underline}---perhaps
certifiably deranged---[monsters]{.underline}. Consider Joseph Stalin,
who, in 1949, was planning to change the climate of the Soviet Union by
planting a lot of trees, and Mao Zedong, who, in 1964, had just carried
out a bizarre social experiment that resulted in an artificial famine in
which tens of millions of Chinese perished. [[Some]{.mark} also
[fear]{.mark} that [a country might use]{.mark} its nuclear [weapons to
"dominate"]{.mark} its area]{.underline}. [That argument was used with
dramatic urgency before 2003 when Saddam Hussein supposedly posed great
danger, and it has been frequently applied to Iran]{.underline}.
[[Exactly how]{.mark} that domination is to be carried out [is never
made clear]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The notion, apparently, is
this: should an atomic rogue state rattle the occasional rocket, other
countries in the area, suitably intimidated, would bow to its demands.
Far more likely, [threatened states would make common cause with each
other and with other concerned countries]{.underline} (including nuclear
ones) [against the threatening neighbor]{.underline}. **[That is how
countries coalesced into an alliance of convenience to oppose Iraq's
region-threatening invasion of Kuwait in 1990.]{.underline}** Yet
[[another concern has been that the weapons will go off, by
accident]{.underline}]{.mark} or miscalculation, devastating the planet
in the process: the weapons exist in the thousands, sooner or later one
or more of them will inevitably go off. But those **[[prognostications
have now failed to deliver for 70 years.]{.underline}]{.mark}** That
time period suggests something more than luck is operating. Moreover,
the notion that if one nuclear weapon goes off in one place, the world
will necessarily be plunged into thermonuclear cataclysm should remain
in the domain of Hollywood scriptwriters.

### 1NC---NO SPACE WAR

**No space war \-\-- cost and inconvenience**

**Wordsworth 15** - I\'m a UK journalist, and write for Gizmodo, Kotaku
and Vice. (Rich, "Why We\'ll Never Fight a Real-Life Star Wars Space
Conflict", December 18, 2015, Gizmodo,
http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2015/12/why-well-never-fight-a-real-life-star-wars-space-conflict//dmeth)

Well, never say never. You might not make to the end of this paragraph
before the sky lights up and the world goes dark. But [there are some
good reasons to be optimistic that won't happen]{.underline}. [One
reassuring factor]{.underline} is that [[the more other countries
develop their militaries, the more dependent on networks they become as
well]{.underline}]{.mark}. [China is developing its own drone programme,
and so is Russia,]{.underline} [which will both presumably be dependent
on satellites to operate]{.underline}. And [the more their (and our)
economies and business interests develop]{.underline}, [the more
everyone will rely on satellites to further their economic
ambitions.]{.underline} In the event that countries were to start
knocking out each other's satellites on a large scale, the
[[consequences]{.mark} across the board -- [for everyone]{.mark} --
[would be disastrous]{.mark}.]{.underline} It [[would also be expensive
in the short term]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Getting things into
orbit]{.underline} -- peaceful or otherwise -- [still isn't cheap, which
is why only a handful of countries regularly do so.]{.underline} [And if
you want to blow up a network of many satellites today]{.underline} (as
you would have to in a first strike, to ensure other satellites couldn't
pick up the slack), [launching small satellites or missiles into orbit
is the only practical way to do that]{.underline} -- [[arming satellites
with their own weaponry]{.mark} just [isn't financially or
technologically feasible on a grand scale]{.mark}]{.underline}. We are,
happily, a long way from a Death Star. "I don't think \[a large first
strike\] would be financially too costly \[if you're\] thinking about
kinetic energy weapons and the air-based or ground-based lasers," says
Jasani. "It's viable. But [if you say, 'I'm going to put an \[ASAT\]
weapon \[permanently\] in orbit', we are then getting into very
expensive and very complicated technology]{.underline}. So my guess is
that in the foreseeable future, what we are going to focus on are the
kinetic energy weapons and possibly lasers that could blind satellites
or affect, for example, the solar panels. That kind of technology will
be delivered in the foreseeable future, rather than having lasers in
orbit \[like\] the Star Wars kind of thing." But [there's
another]{.underline}, possibly even more [persuasive reason that a
kinetic war in space may not happen]{.underline}: [it's just [so much
easier]{.mark} -- and less damaging -- [to mess with satellites without
getting close to them]{.mark}.]{.underline} "[Jamming from the ground is
not difficult]{.underline}," says Quintana. "If you look at the Middle
East, pick a country where there's a crisis and the chances are that the
military in that country has tried to jam a commercial satellite to try
and avoid satellite TV channels broadcasting anti-government messages."
"My guess is that by the time we are ready for space warfare, I think
you may not be banking on your hit-to-kill ASATs, but more on
\[non-destructive\] high-energy laser-based systems," Jasani agrees.
"\[Space debris\] affects all sides, not just the attacked side. The
attacking side will have its own satellites in orbit, which might be
affected by the debris \[of its own attack\]." And if [you really need
to remove an enemy's satellite coverage, you can always try to flatten
or hack the control stations on the ground, leaving the satellites
talking with no-one to listen.]{.underline} "[I don't think physically
blowing things up from the ground is something that people are looking
at again]{.underline}," says Quintana. "[Countries and governments try
to find means other than physical conflict to achieve their strategic
ends.]{.underline} So as [space becomes more commercial and more
civilian and as more scientific satellites go up]{.underline}, then
you'll find that [[states will not seek to directly attack each
other]{.mark}, but will seek other means.]{.underline} "It may just be
that [they will try to cyber-attack the satellites and take them
over]{.underline}, which has been done in the past. It's much easier to
physically or cyber-attack the ground control station than it is to
attack the satellite itself - so why would you not look to do that as a
first port of call and achieve the same ends?" Ultimately, then, [what
might keep us safe from a war in space isn\'t the horror of explosives
in orbit, but a question of cost and convenience.]{.underline}

### 2NC---NO SPACE WAR

**Attacks on space systems don't escalate to ground war**

\-- perceived as foolish/unstrategic

\-- official statements/senior officials say we wouldn't retal w/nukes

**Colby, 16**- senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security
with a JD from Yale law (Elbridge Colby, January 2016, "FROM SANCTUARY
TO BATTLEFIELD: A Framework for a U.S. Defense and Deterrence Strategy
for Space,"
<http://www.cnas.org/sites/default/files/publications-pdf/CNAS%20Space%20Report_16107.pdf>)

But such a threat is of substantially decreasing credibility. [In
today's]{.underline} much different [context, **[no
one]{.mark}**]{.underline} really **[[believes]{.mark}]{.underline}**
that **[[a]{.mark} limited [space attack would]{.mark}]{.underline}**
necessarily or even [**plausibly [be a prelude to]{.mark}** total
**[nuclear war.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Would the United States respond
with a major strategic strike if China or Russia, in the context of a
regional conflict with the United States, struck discriminately at
implicated U.S. space assets in the attempt to defang U.S. power
projection, all while leaving the broader U.S. space architecture alone?
Not only does [[such a]{.mark} massive [response]{.mark}]{.underline}
seem unlikely -- it [[would be]{.underline}]{.mark} positively
[[foolish]{.mark} and irresponsible.]{.underline} Furthermore, would
other nations regard attacks on assets the United States was actively
employing for a local war as off limits to attack? Indeed, any
reasonable observer would have to judge that such discriminate attacks
on U.S. space assets would not necessarily be illegitimate, as, by the
United States' own admission, it relies greatly on its space
architecture for conventional power projection. Moreover,
[[official]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. [[statements on how the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[would
respond]{.mark} to attacks on its space assets]{.underline} -- to the
limited extent such statements exist and the degree to which those given
are clear -- [[offer no indication it would respond massivel]{.mark}y
to]{.underline} such [strikes.]{.underline}53 Perhaps more to the point,
[senior]{.underline} responsible [[U.S. officials]{.mark} have
[telegraphed that the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[would]{.mark}]{.underline} indeed
[[not]{.underline}]{.mark} necessarily [[respond massively to attacks
against]{.mark} its [space assets]{.mark}.]{.underline}54 In light of
these factors, any U.S. space deterrence strategy that is predicated on
an all-or-nothing retaliation to space attacks will become increasingly
incredible and thus decreasingly effective -- and indeed might even
invite an adversary's challenge in order to puncture or degrade U.S.
credibility.

Global [**[retrenchment]{.mark}** is]{.underline} fast [[emerging as
the]{.underline}]{.mark} most coherent and [[ready]{.mark}-made
[**alternative** to]{.mark} the United States' **[postwar
strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Yet]{.mark} **pursuing** [it
would]{.mark} be a **grave mistake**]{.underline}. By [**dissolving**

[would **destabilize** the]{.underline} regional [security **orders** in

This is not to say that U.S. strategy should never change. The United
States has regularly increased and decreased its presence around the
world as threats have risen and ebbed. Even though Washington followed a
strategy
of [containment](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-02-12/new-containment) throughout
the Cold War, that took various forms, which meant the difference
between war and peace in Vietnam, between an arms race and arms control,
and between détente and an all-out attempt to defeat the Soviets. After
the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States changed course again,
expanding
its [alliances](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1993-2000/evolution-of-nato) to
include many countries that had previously been part of the Warsaw Pact.

Likewise, [[the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates

so much [proposing changes]{.underline} within a strategy [as they are
**calling** for]{.underline} the **[wholesale replacement]{.underline}**

its]{.underline} overseas
[commitments]{.underline}---**[not]{.underline}** the indiscriminate
[**abandonment** of a strategy]{.underline} that has served it well for
decades. 

RETRENCHMENT REDUX

Support for retrenchment stems from the view that the United States has
overextended itself in countries that have little bearing on its
national interest. According to this perspective, which is closely
associated with the realist school of international relations, the
United States is fundamentally secure thanks to its geography, nuclear
arsenal, and military advantage. Yet the country has nonetheless chosen
to pursue a strategy of "[liberal
hegemony](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/hegemony-and-after),"
using force in an unwise attempt to perpetuate a liberal international
order (one that, as evidenced by U.S. support for authoritarian regimes,
is not so liberal, after all). Washington, the argument goes, has
distracted itself with costly overseas commitments and interventions
that breed resentment and encourage free-riding abroad. Critics of the
status quo argue that the United States must take two steps to change
its ways. The first is retrenchment itself: the action of
[withdrawing](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-10-15/nonintervention-delusion)
from many of the United States' existing commitments, such as the
ongoing military interventions in the Middle East and one-sided
alliances in Europe and Asia. The second is restraint: the strategy of
defining U.S. interests narrowly, refusing to launch wars unless vital
interests are directly threatened and Congress authorizes such action,
compelling other nations to take care of their own security, and relying
more on diplomatic, economic, and political tools. In practice, this
approach means ending U.S. military operations in
[Afghanistan](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2019-10-21/what-withdrawal-afghanistan-would-look),
withdrawing U.S. forces from the Middle East, relying on an
over-the-horizon force that can uphold U.S. national interests, and no
longer taking on responsibility for the security of other states. As for
alliances,
[Posen](http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/opinion/trump-aside-whats-the-us-role-in-nato.html)
has argued that the United States should abandon the mutual-defense
provision of NATO, replace the organization "with a new, more limited
security cooperation agreement," and reduce U.S. commitments to Japan,
South Korea, and Taiwan. On the question of China, realists have split
in recent years. Some, such as the scholar [John
Mearsheimer](https://thediplomat.com/2015/03/mearsheimers-war-with-china/),
contend that even as the United States retrenches elsewhere, in Asia, it
must contain the threat of China, whereas others, such as Posen, argue
that nations in the region are perfectly capable of doing the job
themselves. Since Trump's election, some progressive foreign policy
thinkers have joined the retrenchment camp. They diverge from other
progressives, who advocate maintaining the United States' current role.
Like the realists, progressive retrenchers hold the view that the United
States is safe because of its geography and the size of its military.
Where these progressives break from the realists, however, is on the
question of what will happen if the United States pulls back. While the
realists favoring retrenchment have few illusions about the sort of
regional competition that will break out in the absence of U.S.
dominance, the progressives expect that the world will become [more
peaceful](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/12/13/infinity-war/?arc404=true)
and cooperative, because Washington can still manage tensions through
diplomatic, economic, and political tools. The immediate focus of the
progressives is the so-called forever wars---U.S. military involvement
in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and the broader war on terrorism---as well
as the defense budget and overseas bases. Although the progressives have
a less developed vision of how to implement retrenchment than the
realists, they do provide some guideposts. [Stephen
Wertheim](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/opinion/sunday/endless-war-america.html),
a co-founder of the Quincy Institute, has called for bringing home many
of the U.S. soldiers serving abroad, "leaving small forces to protect
commercial sea lanes," as part of an effort to "deprive presidents of
the temptation to answer every problem with a violent solution." He
argues that U.S. allies may believe that the United States has been
inflating regional threats and thus conclude that they do not need to
increase their conventional or nuclear forces. Another progressive
thinker, Peter Beinart, has argued that the United States should accept
Chinese and Russian spheres of influence, a strategy that would include
abandoning Taiwan.

IS LESS REALLY MORE?

The realists and the progressives arguing for retrenchment differ in
their assumptions, logic, and intentions. The realists tend to be more
pessimistic about the prospects for peace and frame their arguments in
hardheaded terms, whereas the progressives downplay the consequences of
American withdrawal and make a moral case against the current grand
strategy. But they share a common claim: that the United States would be
better off if it dramatically reduced its global military footprint and
security commitments. 

[This [is a **false promise**]{.mark}]{.underline}, for a number of
reasons. **[[First]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**[retrenchment]{.mark}**
would **[worsen]{.mark}**]{.underline} regional [**security
competition** in [**Europe** and **Asia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
realists recognize that the [U.S. military presence]{.underline} in
Europe and Asia does dampen security competition, but they claim that it
does so at [too high a
price](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/restraint-new-foundation-us-grand-strategy)---and
one that, at any rate, [should be paid by U.S. allies in the
regions]{.underline} themselves. Although [[**pulling back** would
**invite**]{.mark} **regional** security
**[competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}, realist [[retrenchers
admit]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the United States could be
safer]{.underline} in a more dangerous world [because **regional
[rivals]{.mark}** [would **check** one another]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[**This is** a **perilous gambit**]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[because regional **[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline} often [[end up
**implicating U.S.**]{.mark} **[interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [They
might thus **[end up drawing]{.mark}** the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} back **[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[after it has left]{.underline}---[[resulting in]{.mark} a much [**more
dangerous** **venture**]{.mark}]{.underline} [than]{.underline} heading
off the conflict in the first place by [staying]{.underline}. Realist
[retrenchment reveals a hubris]{.underline} that [the **U**nited
**S**tates **can** control consequences and **prevent crises** from
erupting]{.underline} [into war]{.underline}. 

[The progressives' view of **regional security** is]{.underline}
similarly [flawed]{.underline}. These [**retrenchers** reject the
idea]{.underline} that [regional]{.underline} security [**competition**
will **intensify** if the United States leaves]{.underline}. In fact,
[they argue, U.S. **alliances**]{.underline} often **[promote
competition]{.underline}**, as in the Middle East, where U.S. support
for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has emboldened those
countries in their cold war with Iran. But this logic does not apply to
Europe or Asia, where U.S. allies have behaved responsibly.
[A]{.underline} U.S. [**[pullback]{.mark}** from those places is more
[likely to **embolden**]{.mark}]{.underline} the [regional
**[powers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since 2008, [[**Russia**
has [**invaded**](https://www.cfr.org/interactive/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-ukraine)]{.mark} two
of [its **neighbors**]{.mark}]{.underline} that are not members of NATO,
and if the Baltic states were no longer protected by a U.S. security
guarantee, [it is conceivable that Russia would [test]{.mark} the
[boundaries with **gray-zone war**]{.mark}**fare**]{.underline}. [In
**East Asia**]{.underline}, a [U.S. withdrawal would **force
[Japan]{.mark}** to increase its defense capabilities]{.underline} [and
**[change its constitution]{.mark}** to enable it to compete with
China]{.underline} on its own, [[**straining** relations]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} **[So]{.mark}**uth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea]{.underline}.

The **[[second]{.underline}]{.mark}** problem with retrenchment
[[involves]{.mark} **[nuclear prolif]{.mark}**eration]{.underline}. [If
the United States pulled out of **[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[or]{.mark} ended its **alliance** with
**[Japan]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [as]{.underline} many realist advocates
of [retrenchment recommend]{.underline}, some of [its
allies]{.underline}, no longer protected by the U.S. nuclear umbrella,
[would be [tempted to **acquire**]{.mark} **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline} of their own. Unlike the progressives for
retrenchment, the [realists are comfortable with that]{.underline}
result, since they see deterrence as a stabilizing force. Most Americans
are not so sanguine, and rightly so. There are good reasons to worry
about [nuclear
proliferation](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-10-15/do-nuclear-weapons-matter):
[nuclear [**materials** could **end up in**]{.mark} the [hands of
**terrorists**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[states with **less
experience**]{.underline}]{.mark} might [[be]{.underline}]{.mark} more
[**[prone]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} nuclear
**[accidents]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and nuclear
**[powers]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} close [proximity have
**short**]{.mark}**er** **[response]{.mark}** times]{.underline} and
thus [conflicts]{.underline} among them [[have a]{.mark} **greater
[chance]{.mark}** [of **spiraling**]{.mark} into
**escalation**.]{.underline}

**[[Third]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [retrenchment would [**heighten**
**nationalism**]{.mark} and **xenophobia**]{.underline}. In Europe, a
U.S. [**[withdrawal]{.mark}** would send the message]{.underline} that
[every country must fend for itself]{.underline}. It would therefore
[**empower** the **far-right**]{.underline} groups already [making this
claim]{.underline}---[such as the **A**lternative for
**G**ermany]{.underline}, the [**L**eague **i**n **I**taly]{.underline},
[and the **N**ational **F**ront in **F**rance]{.underline}---while
[[**undermining** the]{.mark} centrist [**democratic**
leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} there who told their populations that they
could rely on the United States and NATO. As a result, [Washington would
**lose leverage** over the domestic politics]{.underline} of individual
allies, [particularly]{.underline} younger and more [**fragile
democracies** such as Poland]{.underline}. And since
[these]{.underline} nationalist populist
[[groups are]{.underline}]{.mark} almost always
**[[protectionist]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**retrenchment** [would
**damage**]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. **[[economic
interests]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as well. Even more alarming, many of
the [right-wing nationalists]{.underline} that retrenchment [would
**empower**]{.underline} have called for greater [**accommodation** of
China and Russia]{.underline}.

[A **[fourth]{.mark}** problem]{.underline} [concerns **regional
stability** [after]{.mark}]{.underline} global
[[retrenchment]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The most likely **[end]{.mark}**
state is [a **spheres-of-influence**]{.mark} system]{.underline},
whereby [**China and Russia** dominate their **neighbors**]{.underline},
but [such]{.underline} an order [is]{.underline} inherently
[unstable]{.underline}. The [lines of demarcation]{.underline} for such
spheres [tend to be unclear]{.underline}, and there is [no
guarantee]{.underline} that [[China and Russia]{.mark} will not [**seek
to move** them]{.mark} **outward**]{.underline} over time. Moreover, the
United States cannot simply grant other major powers a sphere of
influence---the countries that would fall into those realms have agency,
too. [If the United States
**ceded [Taiwan](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-02-15/will-china-seize-taiwan)**]{.underline} to
China, for example, [the Taiwanese]{.underline} people [could say
no]{.underline}. The [current]{.underline} U.S. [policy]{.underline}
toward the country [is]{.underline} working and may be
[sustainable]{.underline}. [Withdrawing support from Taiwan]{.underline}
against its will [would **plunge** cross-strait **relations into
chaos**]{.underline}. The entire idea of letting regional powers have
their own spheres of influence [[has an imperial
air]{.underline}]{.mark} that is [[at odds with]{.underline}]{.mark}
modern principles of [**sovereignty** and **[i]{.mark}nternational
[law]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[A **[fifth]{.mark}** problem with
**[retrenchment]{.mark}**]{.underline} is that [it [**lacks** domestic
**support**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [American **people**]{.underline}
may **[favor]{.underline}** greater [burden **sharing**]{.underline},
but there is no evidence that they are onboard with a withdrawal from
Europe and Asia. As a survey conducted in 2019 by the [Chicago Council
on Global

#### US heg boosts transatlantic unity, keeps Russia and China in check, spreads democracy, and leads world peace

The war in Ukraine is a world-historical moment -- a pivotal event that
comes around maybe once every decade. Already the Russian invasion has
upended the post-Cold War European security order. However, beyond
shattering established structures, crises tend to create opportunities.
In this regard, the war in Ukraine is no different. From the standpoint
of the United States, Moscow's blatant aggression has creating an
opening to reassert its leadership of the Western alliance and even
recapture some of its post-Cold War hegemonic position, which has been
challenged by revisionist powers China and Russia and domestic
travails.\[1\] A little over six months after a chaotic exit from
Afghanistan, [**President [Biden]{.mark} and his administration**
[are]{.mark} being [hailed]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the **successful
[coordination]{.mark}** [of a]{.mark} **joint transatlantic
[response]{.mark} in sanctions [against Russia]{.mark} and military aid
to Ukraine**. Joe Biden's triumphant inaugural declaration looks
prescient: "[America is back]{.mark}".]{.underline}

However, in the midst of such triumphalism, it is vital to pause and
consider pathways forward. As the old international order receded, the
Biden administration is facing questions regarding the future direction
of America's international engagement in the "post-February 24, 2022"
world.\[2\] After briefly outlining how the Biden administration arrived
at its pivotal date with history, this article zooms in on five sets of
challenges that the U.S. needs to deal with to sustain the current
"hegemonic moment." Without attention and resolve to mitigate these
challenges, the re-emergence of U.S. leadership in the transatlantic
domain, not to mention any visions of reasserting U.S. hegemony more
broadly, may prove but a flash in the pan.

From Relief to Trepidation and Back Again

In Europe and within the U.S. alliance network more broadly, the Biden
presidency was greeted by and large with a sense of relief. After four
years on Donald Trump's America First rollercoaster, transatlantic
relations would -- so the logic went -- give way to a smoother ride.
[For America's friends and allies, Joe [Biden was a]{.mark} known
quantity, an **experienced [foreign policy leader]{.mark}** with
transatlanticism and alliance solidarity near his heart; a stark
contrast to Trump's unilateralist and transactionalist tendencies.\[3\]
[Biden]{.mark}'s team [articulated a willingness to reassume **America's
place**]{.mark} **at the relevant tables [of]{.mark} international
politics** to "earn back \[... its\] **[leadership]{.mark}
position**".\[4\]]{.underline}

Relatedly, [the leadership role the U.S. has presently assumed remains
in **stark contrast** to how the Trump administration dealt with the
Covid-19 pandemic, shutting borders, hoarding medical supplies, and
engaging in vaccine nationalism.]{.underline}

In the context of these high expectations, the first year of the Biden
administration was a disappointment for many on the old continent. There
were, of course, early successes. The U.S. decision to re-enter the
Paris Climate Agreement and return to the fold at the World Health
Organization (WHO) were greeted with applause by many in Europe. The
President's "feel-good tour" of the old continent in June produced
pledges of support for the EU and NATO as well as headline-grabbing
developments like the B3W (Build Back Better World) infrastructure
initiative and a deal on the 17-year-old EU-U.S. dispute over airline
subsidies.\[5\]

However, dark clouds were brewing on the horizon. The U.S. had already
failed in consulting its European allies on the decision to withdraw
U.S. troops from Afghanistan, ultimately taken in mid-April. The chaotic
exit from the country in August, on the heels of a surprising Taliban
takeover, led observers to question U.S. reliability and credibility and
the Biden administration's policy competence.\[6\]

The Afghanistan debacle was followed in short order by an announcement
of a security pact by the U.S., UK, and Australia, dubbed AUKUS. The
arrangement would grant Australia access to nuclear propulsion
technology for its submarines. In the process, the French -- the one EU
member with ambitions of a sustained security footprint in the
Indo-Pacific -- lost out on a lucrative \$66 billion deal to build
diesel-powered submarines for Australia. In the ensuing dust-up between
the U.S. and France, Paris even called home its ambassador to the United
States.\[7\]

After these debacles, Russia's maximalist calls to renegotiate the
European security architecture and build-up of forces around Ukraine
provided the Biden administration with an opportunity for a
transatlantic reset after a challenging year. By airing intelligence
findings about Russian troop movements and intelligence regarding the
Kremlin's plans, [the [U.S. eroded Moscow]{.mark}'s **ability to rely on
the element of surprise**. Just as importantly, [the U.S. took the lead
in diplomacy]{.mark} before Russia shut the door on such endeavors with
its invasion on 24 February 2022]{.underline}.\[8\]

Because of astute diplomacy and coordination in the weeks leading up to
the invasion, the U.S. and the EU were swift in responding with punitive
sanctions and have been able to up the ante as the Russian attack has
continued. The provision of Western military aid to Ukraine has also
been a joint transatlantic undertaking, and despite some public spats,
such as over the fate of Polish MiG-29 fighter jets, the effort has
allowed Ukraine to inflict considerable damage upon the invading forces.
Meanwhile, NATO is bolstering its defenses on the Eastern flank and has
regained a sense of purpose. In the span of less than three months,
[[doubts over]{.mark} **U.S. [credibility]{.mark}** [have been
traded]{.mark} in [for **celebrations of transatlantic
unity**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}\[9\] Yet the war in Ukraine still
raises several open questions about the future role of the United States
in the world writ large and the shape of the transatlantic relationship
in the coming years. Five sets of challenges appear particularly
pertinent, namely, making most of the transatlantic unity, selling the
U.S. and Western approach globally, engaging in two-theatre great-power
competition, finding a balance between safeguarding democracy, and
dealing with autocracies, and, last but not least, finding domestic
backing for a sustainable foreign policy line.

Cashing in on Transatlantic Unity

[**[The]{.mark} pronounced [unity]{.mark} on sanctions against Russia**
[and]{.mark} the steady stream of **weapons deliveries and humanitarian
[assistance to Ukraine]{.mark}** speak volumes for the
**[reinvigorated]{.mark} strength of [the]{.mark} transatlantic
[bond]{.mark}**. Even Germany has gone against the grain of its
strategic culture]{.underline}, pledging a €100 billion increase in
defense spending and endeavoring to meet NATO's 2-percent-of-GDP
military spending target.\[10\] Declared "brain dead" by French
President Emmanuel Macron in 2019,\[11\] NATO has found a new sense of
purpose, and is now debating the entry of two new members: Finland and
Sweden. Both countries possess a long history of military non-alignment,
robust democratic credentials and relatively strong militaries.\[12\] In
fact, the entry of these two Nordic countries to NATO enjoys broad
support within the alliance, and bipartisan support in Congress.\[13\]
Such seismic shifts would have been unimaginable at the beginning of the
year, let alone in the Trump era.

Yet, barring a leadership change in the Kremlin or a drastic Russian
policy shift, a long era of "neo-containment" beckons on the
continent.\[14\] After years of uncertainty over the future direction of
the Western alliance, [the **[U.S. commitment]{.mark}** to the
**transatlantic relationship** [seems secure]{.mark}]{.underline}, at
least for the time being. The U.S. has, for instance, increased its
troop presence in Europe from 60 000 to 100 000 after the Russian
invasion, alongside its material support for Ukraine.\[15\] In the long
run, however, the future American military presence and shape of NATO's
deterrence posture on the old continent will depend on how the war in
Ukraine ultimately plays out. The extent to which Russia's military
capabilities can be further degraded in Ukraine and the ability of
either the Ukrainians or Russians to achieve successes on the
battlefield before a negotiated solution or a stalemate are just two
vital vectors that will impact contingency planning.

Whether the U.S. can cash in on its allies' manifest willingness to
invest more in defense is an even broader question[. Europeans are
finally answering a call for more equitable burden-sharing that U.S.
administrations have been making for decades.]{.underline} At the same
time, however, the transatlantic relationship has always presented
Washington D.C. with a dilemma. [The ability of the U.S. to influence
its allies has depended on an asymmetry of power between the two sides
of the Atlantic.]{.underline} At the same time, a more capable and
autonomous Europe would likely be less willing to follow Washington's
lead.\[16\] This mode of thought has historically been at the core of
D.C. insiders' gripes regarding European strategic autonomy. Going
forward, U.S. policymakers would need to drop such antiquated views in
favor of a more approach to transatlantic security, one where the U.S.
views European capacity building as positive progress regardless of the
framework wherein such developments take place.\[17\] A more capable
Europe would not only assume more responsibility for the continent's
security, but free up U.S. resources for use elsewhere around the globe.
A stronger Europe thus makes for a better -- even if at times more
independent-minded -- partner. Here the Europeans' manifest demand for
sustained U.S. hegemony and calls for strategic autonomy need not be
irreconcilable.

A Worrying Global Context

While European solidarity has been on display in media headlines, and
the U.S.' traditional allies in the Indo-Pacific have been supportive, a
prominent chunk of the world does not share the American and European
understanding of the war.\[18\] Nor are they willing to take measures to
sanction Russia either symbolically or materially. When the UN General
Assembly voted to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council on 7
April 2022, 93 members voted for the resolution, but 24 voted against
and 58 abstained. Notable abstainers included India, Brazil, South
Africa, Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. Vietnam,
which the U.S. has sought to woo in recent years, voted against.\[19\]
In the Middle East, the U.S.' traditional partners have refused to pump
more oil into the market amidst soaring energy prices.\[20\] Meanwhile,
despite U.S. courtship of India in the Quad framework, New Delhi
continues to balance American demands and its historical relationship
with Moscow.\[21\] Testament to the difficulty of selling the West's
message in the global south, South African President Cyril Ramophosa has
blamed NATO enlargement for the outbreak of the war.\[22\]

The world remains a messy place, and [the ability of the U.S. to counter
**Chinese or Russian influence** globally hinges on the U.S.' ability to
work pragmatically with regimes that possess few democratic
credentials.]{.underline}

From the U.S. and Europe standpoint, this lack of support from outside
the traditional West is a problem. Although the hegemony of the U.S.
dollar makes going against its sanctions difficult,\[23\] how the U.S.,
EU, and their allies have managed to shut Russia out of the global
economy is a warning sign to other potential targets of sanctions.
Therefore, the war could hasten movement away from the dollar and euro
as reserve currencies, eroding the future efficacy of sanctions.\[24\]
Relatedly, the leadership role the U.S. has presently assumed remains in
stark contrast to how the Trump administration dealt with the Covid-19
pandemic, shutting borders, hoarding medical supplies, and engaging in
vaccine nationalism.\[25\] While Covid vaccinations have progressed with
vigor in the West, vaccination rates are lagging in the global south.
There is a stark contrast between the U.S. Congress approving a \$40
billion package to support Ukraine, and its inability to agree on
sufficient funding for the global vaccination drive.\[26\] In this vein,
what might appear as newfound U.S. leadership in the West, can easily be
construed as yet another manifestation of American and Western hypocrisy
elsewhere.\[27\]

Competing on Two Fronts

In the process of upending the European security architecture,
[[the]{.mark} **Ukraine [crisis]{.mark}** [has thrown the U.S.
into]{.mark} the center of [a]{.mark} "**two-front great-power
[competition]{.mark}"**]{.underline}.\[28\] At the start of the Biden
presidency, there were few areas of bipartisan consensus in Washington
D.C., but [the imperative of engaging China in **great-power
competition** came close]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} incoming
[admin]{.mark}istration [recognized China as a priority]{.mark} over
other security challenges, including Russia.]{.underline} In fact, there
was little discernible change beyond rhetorical nuance from the Trump
administration when it came to China policy. The Biden team kept
Trump-era tariffs in place, and despite a joint U.S.-China pledge made
at the COP26 summit, competition has been the order of the day. Joe
Biden's recent statements indicating U.S. willingness to defend Taiwan
against a Chinese attack -- which would be a departure from decades of
"strategic ambiguity" -- underline how the [U.S.' China policy's tides
have shifted in the span of two presidential
administrations.]{.underline}\[29\]

When it came to Russia, [the initial intention of the administration was
to manage the relationship so that the U.S. could finally reorient
towards the Indo-Pacific]{.underline} -- although there was no
expectation of an actual "reset" with Moscow. Although the June meeting
between Biden and Putin in Geneva appeared to pave the way for more
predictable relations initially, [Russia's decision to pursue **regional
revanchism** in Ukraine has laid any such plans to rest]{.underline}.
[The success of Ukraine in withstanding the Russian onslaught, [with the
help of]{.mark} **Western weapons deliveries**, has also enabled [the
U.S.]{.mark} to reframe its approach towards the Kremlin. In the words
of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, the U.S. "want\[s\] to see [Russia
weakened]{.mark} to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things it
has done in invading Ukraine]{.underline}".\[30\] This shift towards
degrading [Russia's capacity is reflected in the investments the U.S. is
willing to make to support Ukraine's cause]{.underline}. These assets
have broad bipartisan support, as manifested in the recent \$40 billion
bill that passed with comprehensive bipartisan support in both houses.
\[31\]

To further complicate matters, just weeks before Russia embarked on its
military adventure, Xi Jinping met Vladimir Putin at the Beijing Winter
Olympics, and the two states released a statement asserting their
friendship had "no limits". While China has refrained from directly
supporting Russia with military equipment, it has not condemned the
invasion or gone along with Western sanctions, instead looking to
benefit from cheaper Russian energy. While the Russia-China relationship
is hardly a happy marriage, Beijing's reaction proves it does not want
to lose a partner who shares its distaste for American hegemony.\[32\]
China is therefore unlikely to forsake Moscow, at least for the
foreseeable future.\[33\]

The key question going forward is how the United States intends to
maintain such a two-theatre posture in the great game of the 21st
century. Obviously, this is a question of attaining and allocating the
necessary resources to sustain such an approach, whether in terms of
troops or materiel. Critics of the U.S. approach to Ukraine have already
pointed out that the rejuvenated focus on the European theatre is a
distraction, and the "U.S. Should \[...\] husband its critical resources
for the primary fight in Asia".\[34\] Regardless of the constellation of
capabilities [[the U.S.]{.mark} can muster for each theatre, the role of
allies will be magnified, [requiring]{.mark} **astute [relationship
management]{.mark}** from the United States **[in]{.mark} marrying [the
concerns and capabilities]{.mark}** [of its]{.mark} **European and
Indo-Pacific [allies and partners]{.mark}**.\[35\] This will be no mean
feat, given the **different threat perceptions and security concerns**
of U.S. friends across the globe.]{.underline}

Dilemmas of Democracy and Autocracy

[President [Biden]{.mark} has [linked]{.mark} **strategic
[competition]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} a broader contest between
**[democracy and autocracy]{.mark}**. For him **safeguarding democracy**
is "the defining challenge of our time."\[36\] To underline U.S.
commitment to bolster **democracy worldwide**, the President fulfilled a
campaign pledge by hosting the first ever Summit for
Democracy]{.underline} in December 2021, albeit to little fanfare. While
this narrative of the competition as a struggle between systems of
governance plays to audiences at home and in the West writ large, it may
actually operate in the converse direction in the rest of the world.
Branding states as laggards is not ideal for enticing them into
cooperation.\[37\] [The world remains a messy place, and the ability of
the U.S. to counter **Chinese or Russian influence globally** hinges on
the U.S.' ability to work pragmatically with regimes that possess few
democratic credentials]{.underline}.

This dilemma has been on full display in the aftermath of Russia's
attack on Ukraine. In its search for softening the spike in energy
prices, the Biden administration has reached out to Saudi Arabia and its
controversial crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and oil-rich Venezuela, a
state under severe U.S. economic sanctions.\[38\] The current crisis has
also opened up opportunities for authoritarian states to haggle with the
hegemon. The opposition of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to
Finland's and Sweden's NATO membership, for instance, can be seen as a
not-so-subtle ploy to obtain concessions from the U.S.\[39\] Of course,
making deals and cultivating strategic relationships with unsavory
regimes were part of [the American toolbox in the bipolar competition of
the Cold War and during the global "War on Terror."]{.underline} [The
difficult task of balancing between the desire for bolstering democracy
and the **imperative of safeguarding U.S. interests** will certainly
remain at the heart of U.S. international engagement for decades to
come]{.underline}.\[40\]

Domestic Concerns and Presidential Wildcards

The Trump era illustrated that the ability of the U.S. to sustain a
globally engaged foreign policy is intimately tied to domestic politics.
Trump consistently questioned the value of U.S. alliances and
partnerships, was suspicious of multilateral institutions and opposed to
free trade, and showed blatant disregard for democratic norms at home
and abroad.\[41\] [This "**[America First]{.mark}" foreign policy
approach** [undercut **U.S. influence** ]{.mark}**globally** as it
pulled out of critical institutions and eroded allies' and partners'
trust in U.S. security guarantees and America's willingness to provide
global public goods.]{.underline}\[42\] Doubts about the U.S. persisted
throughout the Trump presidency, even though day-to-day U.S. diplomatic
engagement and military cooperation with allies and partners remained
intact, and the administration made substantial investments in its
alliances, for instance in the auspices of the European Deterrence
Initiative (EDI).\[43\] Trump's rise to the presidency would not have
been possible without the extreme polarization and hyperpartisanship
that plagues American politics and the wariness of American voters
regarding an active foreign policy. Despite Joe Biden's pledges to unify
the American people,\[44\] there are few signs of these phenomena
abating. The world is thus justifiably holding its breath in
anticipation of the 2024 presidential election.

It is unclear whether the war in Ukraine has created the conditions that
will forestall a drastic foreign policy shift if a Republican candidate
takes the White House in 2024. Admittedly, on Capitol Hill, the
Republican party has, by and large, sought to portray itself as tough on
Russia, creating an air of bipartisanship on the issue. The same goes
for supporting building up NATO defenses on the Eastern flank or for the
alliance's open-door policy, particularly Finnish and Swedish NATO
accession. At the same time, however, some Trumpian politicians and
pundits have questioned the rationale of supporting Ukraine. Trump
himself made headlines in the lead-up to the Russian invasion by
praising Putin.\[45\]

Of course, beyond questions related to European security, Trump or a
Trump-like President would likely retain the core parameters of **[the
"America First" foreign policy approach]{.underline}**. [This would
entail wariness regarding international institutions, a dogged focus on
competition with China and resistance towards multilateralism and free
trade]{.underline}. Even in the event of Democrats holding the White
House, these tropes will continue to impact foreign policy. This is
clear in the remarkable continuity between the China policies of the
Trump and Biden administrations and Biden's "Foreign Policy for the
Middle Class".\[46\] This entailed a pronounced focus on domestic
initiatives during Biden\'s first year, including the \$ 1 trillion
bipartisan infrastructure bill and the initially \$3.5 trillion Build
Back Better framework, which never made it through Congress. In
addition, the Biden administration has made little substantial progress
on trade agreements, which has left it engaging China in great-power
competition "with one hand tied behind its back" -- much to the chagrin
of its allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific.\[47\]

#### U.S. hegemony resists collapse

**Kovac 2/19** (Igor Kovac, PhD in political science from the University
of Cincinnati and Foreign Policy Advisor for the Slovenian Prime
Minister, 2/12/22, "Persistent Imbalance of Power -- A Pervasive
Hegemony Theory", pg ii-iii, accessed 6/18/22)//sfs

Most International Relations [literature suggests that when power
becomes imbalanced, such a situation will be corrected -- hegemony
cannot persist over time.]{.underline} However, [history offers us
several examples of hegemonies lasting over a century, e.g., Ancient
Rome, Ming China.]{.underline} So far [scholars have
offered]{.underline} four [explanations for such enduring
hegemony]{.underline} (Coercive Hegemony, Cooperative Hegemony, Cultural
Hegemony, and Opportunist Hegemony), [with a common mechanism:
ineffective balancing.]{.underline} Namely, [the hegemon has the
capacity to put balancing at bay using different strategies flowing from
the nature and fundamental principles of its hegemony.]{.underline}
Hence, the hegemon uses coercion, institutional leverage, ideological
indoctrination, or buyout, in order to assure its hegemony can endure.
[Yet, through time and through crisis the capacities of the hegemon to
make the balancing ineffective diminishes. As such, these theories all
share a similar assumption]{.underline} -- imbalance is transitory and
thus [hegemony will breakdown. But what if that common assumption is
incorrect. What if under certain conditions, imbalance is not resisted,
but rather serves interests of non-hegemonic states as well as the
hegemon? Twentieth and twenty-first century US hegemony suggests such
conditions may exist. This American imbalance displays a different
nature and fundamental mechanism behind its functioning. Although US
relative power is declining, its global monetary network centrality is
not. Moreover, even in times of severe crisis, such as the breakdown of
the Bretton Woods system, or the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, we
have not witnessed US monetary centrality decline. In fact, quite the
opposite is true.]{.underline} The dynamics associated with an imbalance
of power in favor of the United States runs against the expectations of
existing theories. Therefore, we need a different theory to make sense
of these particularities and make better policy recommendations. Thus, I
have developed a Pervasive Hegemony Theory, which is based on a 'buy-in'
behavior, that better explains US hegemony compared to existing
alternatives. The 'buy-in' behavior relates to non-hegemonic states as
well as the hegemon, in which all [countries continue to use hegemon's
monetary unit in their monetary relations, even in times of severe
economic crisis. This reinforces the hegemony. Even though non-hegemonic
states may not prefer the imbalance of power, they prefer conducting
their economic relations within the hegemon's monetary unit and thus
perpetuate the imbalance.]{.underline} Subsequently, [they can only
maximize their selfish interests and autonomy by buying-in to the
hegemony and reproducing the imbalance of power.]{.underline}
Conversely, the hegemon may not like the current rules and norms of the
international system, but it can change those and obtain the support of
the non-hegemonic states if it accepts to provide its monetary unit as
the central currency of the system. In pursuing this argument, I use
both quantitative (Network Analysis and Time Series) and qualitative
methods (Process Tracing). I use the former on available economic data
to establish the claim of US economic centrality, and that it is
something different than what we have seen in the past. Second, I
process trace the mechanisms of hegemonic and non-hegemonic state
behavior in two international monetary systems (Bretton Woods and
post-Bretton Woods) in order to isolate and identify the buy-in
mechanism and provide an explanation of enduring imbalance -- ownership
over the central monetary unit in global economy. The dissertation,
thus, assesses existing theories and indicates their inadequacies in
explaining an important international phenomenon and provides a more
robust explanation of enduring hegemony with the economic centrality,
namely the ownership of the central monetary unit.

kav

Welcome and good afternoon.

I want to thank all of you for joining me here today when I know how
very busy all of you are.

[Last Spring, Secretary Blinken set out the **[Biden]{.mark}-Harris
Administration['s vision]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **a foreign
[policy]{.mark}** [that **leads with**]{.mark} **[diplomacy]{.mark},
revitalizes our global network of [alliances]{.mark} to meet emerging
global challenges, [and delivers for the]{.mark} American
[people]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is a vison, as the Secretary noted,
that springs from two fundamental principles: [that **[American
leadership]{.mark} and engagement** [matters]{.mark}, and those
countries need to engage and cooperate, now [more than
ever]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is the role of the State Department -- and
America's diplomats and development workers -- to engage around the
world and build that cooperation.

Today, I am happy to be here to present my priorities as Under Secretary
of Arms Control and International Security; known inside of the State
Department as 'T.'

The ideas I list today are in light of the many changes that we see in
the international security landscape. I chose today to present my
priorities, just as we mark the 50th Anniversary of the signing of the
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I) in 1972. To me, it is a
humbling reminder that [even as we face monumental international
security challenges today, our predecessors prevailed through the power
of diplomacy]{.underline}. In everything we do, we will look not only to
make progress on short-term problems, but also to address their root
causes and lay the groundwork for our long-term strength.

I should note that while I am presenting these ideas, adjustments will
be made as we continue to better understand the changes that are taking
place and the security environment around us settles. [Little did we
know last year at the beginning of the Biden Administration that Putin
would invade Ukraine. Things are continuing to change on a large
scale.]{.underline}

[[Some of today's **arms control and international security landscape**
remains the same]{.underline}, [such as the DPRK]{.underline}]{.mark}['s
insistence on advancing its unlawful **weapons of mass destruction
[and]{.mark} ballistic missile programs** and refusing to engage in
diplomacy. The future of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),
still the most viable option to prevent [Iran]{.mark} from developing a
nuclear weapon, remains unclear. We remain strongly committed to our
efforts regarding both the DPRK and the JCPOA. In the meantime, there
are other changes -- like Russia's brutal and **unprovoked war in
Ukraine** and the growing challenges posed by the People's Republic of
China (PRC) -- that present us with many more questions than
answers.]{.underline}

Now is the time to consider a new way to address what are new
challenges. Russia's unprovoked invasion has led us to consider what
gaps now exist. What does the new landscape mean for us and the issues
within T such as arms control, deterrence, nonproliferation, security
assistance, and emerging technologies? [The People's Republic of China
is also posing new challenges in many areas of our
responsibility.]{.underline} How do we address those challenges?
[Technology is advancing, as are the opportunities and challenges posed
by an increased interest in space, while at the same time, climate
change and resource limitations can lead to conflict if not
addressed]{.underline}. [We need to focus on the headlines of today,
while keeping an eye on the trendlines for the challenges to
come.]{.underline}

The T Family is comprised of three Bureaus: The Bureau of Arms Control,
Verification, and Compliance, the Bureau of International Security and
Nonproliferation, and the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. It is my
honor to lead these Bureaus and work closely with their leadership to
use our diplomatic engagements and programs and when needed, sanctions
and other pressure, working with the interagency, to implement these
priorities of mine.

Let me give you a preview. I have nine priorities. They are as follows:

Fortify Arms Control, Nonproliferation, Disarmament, and Related
Activities

Reimagine Security Sector Governance (SSG) and Security Assistance

Address Emerging Technologies from a National Security Perspective

Protect and promote the U.S. and Allies Technological, Military, and
Economic Advantages

Promote, protect, and advance the U.S. Civil -- Nuclear Industry

Strengthen Existing Alliances and Partnerships and Establish New
Partnerships

Building the "T Family Brain Trust" to Address New and Emerging
Challenges to International Security

Examine "New" Areas of Conflict in International Security

Strengthen and Amplify the T Bureaus

The three T Bureaus are developing or will develop a way forward on
these priorities, including new priorities I have asked them to
incorporate. While these are my priorities, I note that [all of the work
of [the Bureaus are important]{.mark} to the **U.S. and [to
international security]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Priority One: Fortify Arms Control, Nonproliferation, Disarmament, and
Related Activities

[[The T Family]{.mark} [will]{.mark} continue to [engage the
international community in]{.mark} **strengthening existing [arms
control]{.mark}, [nonprolif]{.mark}eration, [and]{.mark}
[disarmament]{.mark} regimes, and related activities,** including in
light of recent challenges to those regimes. This includes, where
possible, meaningful engagements and dialogues with Russia and the
People's Republic of China.]{.underline}

I have worked in the areas of arms control, nonproliferation, and
disarmament for 30 years and I can say that [arms control remains as
important today as it ever was]{.underline}. While there have certainly
been challenges to and violations of international arms control
agreements by a handful of countries, arms control is not dead as some
would like you to believe. [Arms control remains an important means to
increase allied and global security by reducing risk and enhancing
stability.]{.underline} The importance of arms control will also grow as
we face competitors pursuing reckless and destabilizing buildups of
their nuclear forces combined with opaque, nontransparent nuclear use
doctrines. However, progress can only be made in a situation of
de-escalation, not escalation. [In all cases, we need willing partners
sitting across and around the table.]{.underline}

We remain committed to the implementation of New START and eventually
getting back to the table to continue the dialogue on laying the
groundwork for future arms control and to the pursuit of follow-on
measures to the New START treaty. As you know, following Russia's
unprovoked and brutal war of aggression against Ukraine, we have
suspended our Strategic Stability Dialogue (SSD). That said, the issues
that have been laid out prior to Russia's further invasion of Ukraine
are even more important now. In that respect, we want to sustain limits
on the Russian systems covered under New START beyond 2026, limit the
new kinds of nuclear weapons Russia has fielded or is developing, and
address all nuclear weapons including Russian non-strategic nuclear
weapons.

We must also be flexible as we consider the ways in which we pursue risk
reduction and future arms control measures. We will be looking at the
different types of forms these efforts can take, including but not be
limited to a traditional approach of focusing on negotiating treaties.
The way forward in this new international security landscape may be in
the form of initiatives like the U.S. voluntary commitment not to
conduct destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) missile testing
recently announced by Vice President Harris, or codes of conduct, or
best practices. We can see from the current crisis that the security
environment remains complex and is becoming more complex[. There is no
single, elegant solution to managing nuclear or other 21st century
risks. [The U.S.]{.mark} is prepared to be creative in finding ways
forward and partnering with others to make the world safer. That is what
being a leader in arms control is about.]{.underline}

On nuclear disarmament, [we [remain committed to a **world without
nuclear weapons**]{.mark} in the context of **enhancing international
security overall.**]{.underline} While our concerns about the ability of
the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) to achieve its
goals have not changed, we remain committed to engaging in pragmatic
efforts to pursue effective measures related to nuclear disarmament.
This includes work conducted by the International Partnership for
Nuclear Disarmament Verification (IPNDV), the Creating an Environment
for Nuclear Disarmament (CEND), the Stockholm Initiative for Nuclear
Disarmament, and the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Initiative (NPDI),
with whom we work closely.

We support the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and will
work to achieve its entry force while maintaining our moratorium on
nuclear explosive testing. We also continue to seek negotiations on a
cut-off in the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons
or other nuclear explosive devices and call on all relevant countries to
join us in declaring and maintaining a moratorium on such production. We
will also continue to work with our P5 colleagues, circumstances
permitting, to strengthen the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and
its three pillars. The U.S. assumes coordination of the P5 Process in
June, and we hope to build on previous efforts. The recent P5 statement
on the prevention of nuclear war is a good example of the important work
we can do together; we must hold each other to those commitments.

We will put renewed focus on these efforts and now that travel
restrictions have lifted, we are looking at when we can meet face to
face with partners in these forums and discuss ways to move ahead,
especially taking into account how the Kremlin's further invasion of
Ukraine has impacted the landscape of that work. Indeed, Russia's
nuclear saber-rattling only underscores the importance of preserving the
record of non-use of nuclear weapons.

Our Bureaus will also continue to lead efforts to maximize support for
enhanced verification capabilities throughout [the U.S. government by
partnering with the interagency, academia, the scientific community,
non-Governmental Organizations, private industry, and
others.]{.underline}

There are other new challenges that require continued attention. [**The
People's Republic of [China]{.mark} (PRC**) [is]{.mark} **rapidly
[building]{.mark}** up [a **larger**]{.mark}**, more diverse [nuclear
arsenal]{.mark}.** The accelerating pace of the PRC's nuclear expansion
may enable it to have up to **700 nuclear warheads by 2027**. The PRC
likely intends to have at least 1,**000 warheads by 2030**, exceeding
the estimated size that the United States projected just two years ago
in 2020.]{.underline}

As I noted in my speech last year at the NATO Weapons of Mass
Destruction (WMD) Conference, and it remains true to this day, the U.S.
continues to request that the PRC be more transparent about the purpose
and direction of its nuclear strategy. There is currently no formal
dialogue between our governments on this subject, and limited tools are
available to mitigate risk and prevent crisis escalation with the PRC.
[We will continue to seek engagement with appropriate PRC officials on
risk reduction.]{.underline}

As you know, [the **Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty Review Conference,
or NPT** RevCon, will at long last take place in August in New
York]{.underline}. With the Russian government's reckless and
destabilizing rhetoric, it is more important now than ever for all
States Parties to reaffirm the importance of the nuclear
nonproliferation regime and recommit to its goals. The August NPT RevCon
provides an opportunity to do that. [While [the U.S.]{.mark} recognizes
the challenges that Russia's actions pose to the NPT, we [will
emphasize]{.mark} **practical [actions]{.mark}** responsible nuclear
powers can take [to reduce nuclear risks and pursue]{.mark} a
**realistic path on arms control and [disarmament]{.mark}**, and to
ensure that all NPT Parties can realize its full benefits.]{.underline}
The RevCon presents an opportunity to reflect both on how much has been
accomplished and on what can and must be done to preserve and extend
that progress. [[The NPT remains instrumental in limiting the risk of
nuclear war]{.mark} by avoiding a cascade of nuclear proliferation and
laying the groundwork for progress on disarmament.]{.underline}

[[The U.S. will]{.mark} use the Review Conference **to [promote]{.mark}
its objectives in all three of the NPT's pillars** -- the areas of
nonproliferation and [strengthened safeguards, peaceful uses of nuclear
energy, and nuclear disarmament]{.mark}.]{.underline} We plan to find
areas of common ground on measures to reduce the risks of nuclear war
and a positive dialogue among Nuclear Weapons States (NWS) and
Non-Nuclear Weapons States (NNWS).

[[The U.S. is]{.mark} also [committed **to**]{.mark} **the third pillar
of the NPT -- the [peaceful uses of nuclear energy, science, and
technology]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In that respect[, [the
U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} and the UK have co-led an effort to build a
multilateral deliverable, called the "Sustained Dialogue on Peaceful
Uses," to promote peaceful uses of nuclear energy, science, and
technology. The Sustained Dialogue aims to integrate non-traditional
stakeholders in the NPT process to promote broader acceptance of
peaceful uses as a solution to development challenges and to create a
lasting framework that better captures peaceful use assistance as a
dividend of the NPT. It provides a benefit of the NPT that often gets
overshadowed by political debates on nuclear disarmament and
nonproliferation.

Here, I want to thank my colleagues, Ambassador Adam Scheinman, Special
Representative of the President for Nuclear Nonproliferation, for his
leadership as we prepare for the NPT Review Conference, and for the work
that former Assistant Secretary Tom Countryman has accomplished since he
agreed to return to us and assist in this process.

We also see the Review Conference as an opportunity to recognize the
continued need for a strong International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
and its work on safeguards, safety, and security. [The IAEA has been
doing significant work in the area of peaceful uses as well as in other
areas of concern, including convening the recent first Review Conference
of the Amended Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear
Materials, its work on **cybersecurity, on nuclear law, and in other
areas.**]{.underline} Strong U.S. leadership on nonproliferation will
also involve continuing to promote the combination of an IAEA
Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and an Additional Protocol (AP) as
the de facto international standard for verifying that nuclear material
is not diverted from peaceful uses. This year marks the 25th anniversary
of the AP, and so now is the time to reinvigorate our efforts in support
of its universal adoption. [We will also reiterate our support for the
negotiation of a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty (FMCT) and for all
states to halt production of fissile material for use in nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}

Moving on to the other important areas in priority one, there is a
renewed focus on the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). As I noted at
the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva last year, for the past two
decades, efforts to strengthen the Convention have been treading water.
States Parties have been unable to agree to significant action. We face
a biological weapons threat that is real and, in many respects, growing.
Some states continue to possess sophisticated, well-established
biological weapons programs, while non-state actors have shown
continuing interest in acquiring biological weapons capabilities.
Additionally, the widespread availability of sophisticated scientific
and technological tools and methods is gradually eroding barriers to the
development of biological weapons.

COVID-19 is a wake-up call for all of us. The astonishing human toll of
the pandemic has illustrated our shared vulnerability to novel
pathogens.

In Geneva, I noted a two-pronged approach. The Review Conference should
take near-term, concrete action to strengthen the Convention and benefit
States Parties. These actions include further operationalizing
assistance under Article VII; establishing a voluntary fund for
technical cooperation; creating a mechanism to review advances in
science and technology; deepening collaborations on biosafety and
biosecurity; staffing the Implementation Support Unit to carry out these
roles; and enabling more agile decision making. The second way forward
is for the Review Conference to take steps to address the harder issues.
It should establish a new expert working group to examine possible
measures to strengthen implementation of the Convention, increase
transparency, and enhance assurance of compliance.

I was very happy this year to appoint a new BWC Special Representative
and Deputy Special Representative to lead the government's engagements
on the BWC. I am pleased that the States Parties reached consensus to
delay the Review Conference until November, which allows time for the
newly nominated RevCon President to prepare for the meeting. Our Special
Representative Ken Ward will spend the next few months working closely
with allies and like-minded countries as we turn our broad concepts into
specific proposals.

[Along with this effort is work by my team to [enhance\[s\] biosafety
and biosecurity norms, practices, tools, and resources to bolster
cooperation]{.mark} in forums such as the **BWC, Global Partnership, and
the Global Health Security Agenda**. We will work to ensure the tools
needed to address these challenges have the attention and resources
needed to confront biological challenges. We will work to build national
capacity to mitigate biological threats.]{.underline}

Regarding the Chemical Weapons Convention or CWC, the United States is
on track to complete destruction of its chemical weapons by September
2023, and we have destroyed over 97 percent of our fully declared
stockpile. [Given the potential chemical weapons threat to Ukraine, the
United States is again leading and working closely with allies and
partners.]{.underline} I am proud of the bilateral security assistance
that the United States has provided to Ukraine, including over \$100
million in life-saving protective and detection equipment and related
medical countermeasures, in addition to funds provided to the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) that will be
used to assist Ukraine to protect against the threat of chemical
weapons.

The Bureau of Arms Control, Verification, and Compliance is also
continuing to work with the OPCW to hold Russia and Syria accountable
for their past chemical weapons use and to deter further use. We look
forward to additional OPCW reports this summer from its Investigation
and Identification Team that will identify those responsible for
chemical weapons attacks in Syria. The Bureau will continue to make
advances in chemical forensics to improve the ability of the United
States, allies, partners, and the OPCW to attribute the use of chemical
weapons. The CWC States Parties Review Conference in 2023 is another
opportunity for States Parties to reaffirm their commitment to the CWC
and its implementation. We are now considering our goals for the Review
Conference to advance its work.

In all our work, we will continue to combat disinformation against U.S.
activities and engagements.

[[The U.S. has been a leader in]{.mark} the development of
**conventional [arms control instruments]{.mark}**, including the Treaty
on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and the Vienna Document on
Confidence- and Security-Building Measures]{.underline}. Despite
Russia's war on Ukraine, we continue to see a role for conventional arms
control in the Euro-Atlantic region and beyond. This kind of arms
control can enhance mutual confidence and transparency among states and
reduce the risk of conflict. The Bureau of Arms Control, Verification,
and Compliance continues to support full compliance with existing
conventional arms control agreements and the development of new ideas
for future confidence- and security-building mechanisms, including the
modernization of the Vienna Document to reflect the new
political-military realities in Europe. It is important to have a base
of existing conventional arms control instruments that we can build on
to restore a more enduring peace.

[Moving on to fortifying related activities as I also noted in this
priority, we will enhance the role of export controls and counter
proliferation measures in preventing the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction and their delivery systems, destabilizing advanced
conventional weapons, and related technologies.]{.underline} [The
multilateral export control regimes]{.underline} -- Missile Technology
Control Regime, Nuclear Suppliers Group, Wassenaar Arrangement, and
Australia Group -- [remain important bodies through which we work with
our allies and partners to address proliferation challenges. The regimes
protect nonproliferation imperatives while providing predictability for
exporters and are the basis for preventing advanced technologies from
falling into adversarial competitors. These regimes and institutions
must adjust to the challenges in the international security landscape.
We will enhance [U.S. leadership]{.mark} in these regimes and
institutions and advance novel approaches to the challenges each regime
face.]{.underline} We will also support the important work of the Bureau
of International Security and Nonproliferation's programmatic offices
that promote adherence to the regimes' guidance and updates to the
control lists among non-member countries, thereby expanding the reach of
nonproliferation norms. In that respect, I commend you to go online and
learn more about the extensive programmatic work of the T Bureaus.

Priority Two: Reimagine Security Sector Governance (SSG) and Security
Assistance

[The T Family [will continue to promote **democracy**]{.mark}**,
transparency, and accountability** among our **allies and partners** as
we lead the Department's Security Sector Governance (SSG)
efforts]{.underline}. [This includes ensuring SSG is accounted for in a
methodical, transparent way in our arms transfer and **security
assistance decision-making**, **supported by holistic diplomatic
engagement**, **[and]{.mark} [protecting human rights]{.mark} and
civilian security**.]{.underline} SSG is about encouraging the
leadership and security institutions we partner with to provide security
to their people as a public good, rather than leveraging their power to
further the narrow interests of the elite. The T Family will reassert
the imperative of democratic principles and human rights at the center
of our nation's security assistance programs.

A fundamental aspect of this future work is to ensure that we integrate
SSG into larger issues of foreign policy. Assistance should be an
integral part of a longer, holistic, diplomatic strategy for our foreign
policy goals and approach with countries rather than be transactional.
We seek SSG integrated in a methodical, transparent way in our arms
transfer and security assistance decision-making with diplomatic
engagement.

For example, the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs will continue
providing advisory assistance through the Global Defense Reform Program
(GDRP), which seeks to improve security sector governance and
institutional capacity of select partners at the service, ministerial,
and national levels. By focusing on systems and processes, GDRP projects
aim to build the resilience of U.S. partners and their security
institutions, enhance effectiveness and accountability, and better align
the security sector to the needs and challenges of the partner nation
and its citizens.

SSG is shaped by hard lessons learned. [Americans are rightly wary of
prolonged [U.S.]{.mark} military interventions abroad]{.underline}. We
have seen how they have often come at far too high a cost, both to us
and to others. When we look back at the past decades of our military
involvement in the world, we must remember what we have learned about
the limits of force alone to build a durable peace; that the day after a
major military intervention is always harder than we imagine; and how
critical it is to pursue every possible avenue to a diplomatic solution.
Security sector assistance cannot overcome or 'fix' underlying
structural or political challenges. Rather, it must be part of a broader
effort alongside lines of effort in the areas of justice,
democratization, economic growth, countering corruption, and addressing
stakeholder equities and concerns across the political spectrum. It is
not enough to build defense institutions in tandem with "train and
equip" missions; security sector governance must be the pacesetter.

Priority Three: Address Emerging Technologies from a National Security
Perspective

As part of the Secretary's modernization efforts to address 21st Century
threats, [the T Family is important to the Department's [efforts to
address **emerging technologies**]{.mark} **from a national security
perspective**. [That includes leading efforts to prevent]{.mark} the
[prolif]{.mark}eration [of]{.mark} these technologies for purposes
related to **[w]{.mark}eapons of [m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction,
delivery system[s]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} destabilizing advanced
conventional weapons**, **to enhance alliance military [cooperation on
these technologies]{.mark}**, and **to develop appropriate norms of
responsible behavior regarding their use.**]{.underline} T Bureaus will
enhance their work on emerging technology with new offices and
expertise.

Our Bureaus are also engaged in discussions on other threats posed by
emerging national security challenges presented by new technologies such
as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum information sciences, and
biotechnology, among others. We are looking at ways in which these
challenges can be addressed considering the changing nature of the
technology and threats posed by adversarial uses. The PRC's
Military-Civil Fusion strategy, which blurs the lines between civil and
military development, further compounds these challenges.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} risk that sensitive technologies can be
transferred via intangible means make it critical to conduct outreach to
academia and industry and ensure proper vetting of foreign visitors and
students, so they do not contribute to programs of concern.

We will work to implement related national security-focused strategies
developed by the T Bureaus and including by supporting related
Department efforts in the United Nations. [This work will focus on how
new technologies could present opportunities and risks to the security
of [U.S.]{.mark} allies and partners]{.underline}.

The T Bureaus and I will also promote the use of norms of responsible
behavior or codes of conduct when promoting risk reduction in areas of
emerging technologies such as space. AVC's Office of Emerging Security
Challenges [[has been consulting with **allies**]{.mark} **and partners
at multilateral forums** and there is broad support for this approach.
Other areas where we will seek [to advance efforts to develop norms of
responsible behavior include]{.mark} [a]{.mark}rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence, [biotech]{.mark}nology, [and quantum
computing]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The U.S. is also part of the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on
emerging technologies in the area of Lethal Autonomous Weapons (LAWS)
under the auspices of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons
(CCW).]{.underline} In March 2022, the U.S. Delegation submitted a
proposal for consideration by the GGE titled "Principles and Good
Practices on Emerging Technologies in the Area of Lethal Autonomous
Weapons Systems" cosponsored by delegations from a number of other
countries. This document builds on how International Humanitarian Law
applies to LAWS and proposes additional measures that will be discussed
by the GGE in July 2022. I will continue to support this effort.

Priority Four: Protect and promote the US and Allies Technological,
Military, and Economic Advantages

[American and allied technological advancements are core elements of the
U.S. industrial strategy and President Biden's key priorities, and the T
Family will continue efforts to keep such technology and advancements
from illegal acquisition.]{.underline} As noted, we are particularly
concerned with threats posed by the PRC's Military-Civil Fusion Strategy
that will fuse together its civilian economy and defense establishment
so that advanced and emerging technologies drive economic and military
modernization simultaneously.

The T Family has led U.S. participation in the four nonproliferation
export control regimes for over 30 years and is partnering with allies
and partners in other regional and bilateral efforts as we further build
on these coalitions to protect sensitive technologies from adversarial
acquisition and exploitation.

The T Family will also continue its updates to the U.S. Munitions List,
engaging foreign governments as well as industry and university partners
at home and at abroad to bolster their understanding on how to comply
with applicable U.S. export control regulations, and strengthen allies
and partners' end-use monitoring programs for U.S. defense articles and
services.

Priority Five: Promote, protect, and advance the US Civil -- Nuclear
Industry

[[The T Family]{.mark} \[The Bureau of Arms Control, Verification, and
Compliance, the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation,
and the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs\] [supports]{.mark} the
Department's efforts to promote **U.S. nuclear power
[alternatives]{.mark}** that support global norms of nonproliferation,
safety, and security, including traditional large nuclear power plants
and new, innovative small modular reactors, [as part of]{.mark} **the
solution to global [climate change]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The U.S. will
also continue to promote and support global norms of nonproliferation,
safety, and security, and help to protect allies and partners' critical
energy infrastructure.

The Foundational Infrastructure for the Responsible Use of Small Modular
Reactor Technology (FIRST) is one such endeavor.

[The FIRST program provides capacity-building support consistent with
the IAEA's Milestones Approach to enable partner countries to benefit
from advanced nuclear technologies and meet their clean energy goals
under the highest standards of nuclear safety, security, and
nonproliferation.]{.underline}

We will continue to seek engagements with countries through FIRST and
other efforts that build capacity under the highest international
standards and meet their energy needs.

[FIRST was one of the Presidential deliverables for the April 2021
Leaders' Summit on Climate and at the COP26 Climate Change
Conference.]{.underline} We spearheaded an announcement by Special
Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and Romanian President Klaus
Iohannis on cooperation to build a first of a kind small modular reactor
in Romania. We have begun engagements under FIRST in recent months with
the Philippines and Ghana, and we continue to seek engagement with other
countries considering nuclear power for their clean energy needs. We
have also recently signed two Memorandum Of Understandings on nuclear
cooperation with the Philippines and Armenia.

We will also continue to engage all who are looking to take advantage of
nuclear energy's benefits to carefully consider the larger political,
economic, and strategic consequences of their choices for peaceful
nuclear energy cooperation partners, and---as countries are reminded of
the urgent security risks posed by Russia and others' energy
diplomacy---we will aim to greatly deepen cooperation and coordination
among like-minded allied and partner nuclear suppliers.

Priority Six: Strengthen Existing Alliances and Partnerships and
Establish New Partnerships

This goal connects all the other priorities. While it remains important
to strengthen our relationship with traditional allies and partners, it
is also important that we build new relationships with other countries
who also are within our national security interests. In that respect,
the T Family will enhance consultations with allies and partners and
establish dialogues with new partners to develop and deepen a shared
understanding of the changing international security environment and
thereby further national goals and objectives. We will also negotiate
security agreements to support closer cooperation.

For example, where appropriate, arms transfers and defense trade offer a
key tool to strengthening alliances and establishing new partnerships.
In the wake of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, many of Russia's
traditional security partners express concern on their own dependance on
Moscow in terms of the demonstrated performance of Russian systems in
their inventories as well as potential future difficulties obtaining
future support and sustainment. [[We will work]{.mark} with industry to
encourage countries [to diversify away from **Russia**]{.mark}**n
dependance**.]{.underline}

#### U.S. heg is a prerequisite to solve existential risks, including the rise of [authoritarian regimes]{.underline} and [climate change]{.underline}

coming to Zurich, he taught at various universities in North America,
including Johns Hopkins University\'s School for Advanced International

**[The international order is in deep trouble]{.underline}**, and not
only since the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic. [This is not how
things were supposed to turn out.]{.underline} The collapse of the "evil
empire," the end of the Cold War and the integration of Central and
Eastern Europe into the EU were supposed to bring about a new era of
stability and prosperity, the latter epitomized most prominently by
China's embrace of the market. Liberalism was supposed to reign supreme.
In the grand battle of ideas, Marx had lost out, Hegel had won --- or so
his American acolyte, Francis Fukuyama, claimed. Fukuyama proclaimed
that the "end of history" was at hand, and the cognoscenti and would-be
cognoscenti on both sides of the Atlantic enthusiastically applauded.
[Three decades later, **the world is in disarray.**]{.underline} The
attacks of September 11 were a drastic reminder that not everybody was
sold on Fukuyama's utopia. The financial crisis that followed the
collapse of Lehman Brothers and, with it, the house of cards built on a
derivatives market that had spun out of control exposed the
irrationality of rational behavior --- taking more and more risks simply
because everybody else did so. Finally, [COVID-19 has demonstrated how
quickly the]{.underline} beautiful [world of ever-expanding consumer
choices]{.underline}, sustained by cheap labor in remote parts of the
world, [can grind to a]{.underline} screeching [halt.]{.underline}
Benign Hegemon It is too early to tell whether or not global turbulences
have reached a point of no return. The prospects are not great, and that
has a lot to do with the United States. There is a strong sense that
**[America's hegemonic position]{.underline}**, which [it assumed after
World War II, **is on the wane and**, with it, **the country's
"commitment to promoting a liberal international order."**]{.underline}
Or, perhaps, the United States suffers from a severe case of "leadership
fatigue" and no longer wants to play the role of the "benign hegemon."
The notion of the benign hegemon is derived from **[hegemonic stability
theory]{.underline}**, popular among some experts in international
relations. The theory [**posits that order and stability in world
affairs crucially depend on a Great Power** capable of sustaining them
and willing to do so.]{.underline} As Stephen Kobrin, of the Wharton
School, has recently put it, "A stable, open economy requires a hegemon,
a dominant power who can provide some of the necessary public goods,
absorb costs, and order the system." Although [this
pertains]{.underline} particularly [to international economic
relations]{.underline}, it can be applied to [other areas, such as
international security. **Order and stability require**, among other
things, **that the hegemonic power formulate and underwrite the rules
that define and govern** the **interactions** between states in the
international system.]{.underline} This was the case in the second half
of the 19th century when Great Britain assumed this role, providing and
guaranteeing global public goods such as free trade, capital mobility
and the British pound, backed up by the gold standard, as the global
reserve currency. The system came to an end with [World War
I]{.underline}. The conflict [left Britain weakened]{.underline} and
largely unable to reassume its prewar role. [The interwar period was
characterized by turmoil and crises, paving the way for the rise of
autocratic regimes]{.underline}, committed to establishing a new order
on the ruins of the old one. They accomplished the latter, but the new
order was not theirs to create. The new hegemonic power that emerged
from the war was not Hitler's Germany but the United States, which
filled the void left by an exhausted Great Britain. [This was anything
but a natural transition.]{.underline} In fact, for most of the interwar
period, the United States had refused to get entangled in international
affairs. America's retreat from internationalism after World War I was
epitomized by Congress's refusal to join the League of Nations --- and
that despite the fact that the league had been the brainchild of US
President Woodrow Wilson. Isolationism went hand in hand with
protectionism. Throughout the 19th century and way into the beginning of
the 20th, the United States boasted some of the highest tariffs in the
world. The culmination was the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930,
which had a devastating impact on international trade and contributed to
the Great Depression. It was not until the United States entered the war
against Nazi Germany that it assumed the role commensurate to its
position as the economically and militarily by far strongest power in
the world. Alternative Options The failure of the most recent G20
meeting in Rome to arrive at a meaningful common position on global
warming and climate change ahead of the COP26 in Glasgow is further
proof that [the United States is no longer in a position to fill this
role.]{.underline} Instead of leading, President Joe Biden blamed China
and Russia "for any disappointment over the level of commitment by G20
leaders to fight climate change." This is not to deny that Biden has a
point. But given the enormity of the impact climate change is bound to
have on the natural environment and life on this planet, it is little
more than an exercise in passing responsibility. Biden's remark,
however, does address a serious issue, namely the role of China in a
rapidly changing world. A few weeks ago, [Chinese coal production
reached new historic highs]{.underline}, amounting to an estimated 4
billion tons for this year. Accelerated coal production is supposed to
alleviate energy shortages that have threatened to slow down the
country's growth. Unfortunately, [emissions-wise, coal happens to be one
of the worst sources of energy. **A new study on the impact of carbon
dioxide emissions** on coastal areas **predicts catastrophic
devastation**]{.underline} as a result of rising sea levels for some of
the world's megacities, particularly in India, Indonesia, Vietnam and
China --- all major coal consumers. Given the concentration of China's
population in a string of coastal cities, one might assume that it has a
particular interest in **[combating climate change]{.underline}**. In
theory, this [**would entail** an **active involvement** in global
governance]{.underline}, a proposition that China has been more than
reluctant to embrace, presumably because it would entail directly
challenging the United States. At the same time, however, China has
launched major initiatives, such as the foundation of the Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank and particularly the One Belt, One Road
initiative. Together with China's massive engagement in Africa, these
projects leave the impression that they are part of a comprehensive
drive designed to establish China as an alternative to the United
States. This might herald the emergence of a new system, no longer
dominated by one power but multipolar, and certainly very different from
the one established after World War II. For, as Princeton's John
Ikenberry has noted a few years ago, **["there is no liberal
internationalism without American and western hegemony --- and that age
is ending."]{.underline}** With the decline of the United States and the
parallel rise of China, countries have the option to "seek alternative
patrons rather than remain dependent on Western largess and support."
**[The end result might very well be a bifurcated world order, on the
heels of a period of instability and turmoil]{.underline}**, or what Ian
Bremmer and Nouriel Roubini have called a "G-Zero" world, **[one without
clear leadership and global cooperation.]{.underline}** Bifurcation
means the coexistence of competing systems that follow fundamentally
different rules. This can already be observed in the realm of economic
governance. Olga [Petricevic and]{.underline} David [Teece
have]{.underline} recently [warned of a "noticeable defiance of the
principles of classical economic liberalism and the rule-of-law" by
Russia and China.]{.underline} The Chinese "alternative model of
governance," they note, "is deploying coordinated protectionist trade
and investment policies and government intervention aimed at accessing
and acquiring foreign intellectual property, thereby influencing the
global economic and innovation system." Its success is likely to inspire
imitation and attempts to jump on the bandwagon, resulting not only in
bifurcation but in polarization reminiscent of the Cold War period.

[It has been a bumpy year for the restraint coalition]{.underline} ---
that loose network of analysts, advocates and politicians calling for a
[sharply **reduced US role** in the world.]{.underline} Having reached
peak influence with the withdrawal from Afghanistan, this group
initially found itself marginalized by Russia's war in Ukraine. Now, the
[restraint crowd is offering a renewed critique of US policy, one that
will]{.underline} probably [prove to be]{.underline} persistent, though
[**not persuasive**.]{.underline} Restraint is a broad church. It
features anti-interventionist academics, who often style themselves as
non-ideological "realists," alongside well-funded think tanks such as
the Quincy Institute. It includes libertarians such as Senator Rand Paul
who deplore the financial costs of US foreign policy and progressives
who contend that American globalism is a cover for imperialism and
neoliberalism. There are pacifists who believe that all wars are
criminal, as well as nationalists such as Senator Josh Hawley who argue
that being appropriately hawkish on China requires being more dovish on
nearly everything else. [Some restrainers seek wholesale global
retrenchment; others mainly decry ongoing US involvement in Europe and
the Middle East. What unites them is a conviction that the overuse of US
power has been catastrophic for America and the world. This coalition
seemed ascendant a year ago, when President Joe Biden denounced the
"forever wars" while pulling out of Afghanistan.]{.underline} That
decision, two analysts argued, marked Biden as a hard-nosed realist ---
[and perhaps an ally in the struggle to reshape American
diplomacy.]{.underline} [Yet the moment **didn't last**. The collapse of
the Afghan state even before the US finished withdrawing showed that,
while waging wars is expensive, losing them can impose a **serious
cost**. Then came Russia's assault on Ukraine. As Vladimir Putin's
forces sought to restore the Soviet empire and murdered Ukrainian
citizens, they revealed just **how awful** a world shaped by great
powers other than Washington might be.]{.underline} Indeed, Biden isn't
getting much praise from self-proclaimed realists today. [While refusing
to intervene militarily, Biden has otherwise backed Ukraine with money,
weapons and other support.]{.underline} NATO --- whose peaceful
expansion allegedly forced Putin to order a campaign of aggression and
murder --- now appears likely to add two new members, Finland and
Sweden. [Biden has even invoked the rhetorical legacy of his cold war
predecessors, declaring that Ukraine is a vital front in the struggle to
save the free world.]{.underline} In response, the restraint coalition
has itself opened a new front, finding multiple reasons to attack
Biden's Ukraine policy. First is cost. Sustaining a medium-sized country
under a ferocious military assault is fantastically expensive. The
latest US support package for Ukraine totals some \$40 billion ---
money, Hawley complained, that could be better spent on giving US
military personnel a generous raise. Some Republicans in Congress seem
to agree --- 57 representatives and 11 senators voted, unsuccessfully,
against the aid package. Second is risk. No one knows how the war in
Ukraine will end. If the US helps Ukraine defend itself too
successfully, the thinking goes, then perhaps a humiliated Russia will
escalate wildly rather than accept defeat. Finally, there is politics.
With Biden having gone all-in on Ukraine, there's little space for the
restraint contingent on the left. But Hawley and other Republicans
seeking to inherit Donald Trump's political base clearly believe that
there is a constituency for claims that supporting a vulnerable
democracy equates to putting "America last." It is uncharitable to label
such arguments "pro-Putin." Forty billion dollars is real money, given
that the Pentagon is struggling to find a 10th of that for urgent
near-term improvements to America's military posture in the Pacific.
There is, undoubtedly, danger in a scenario where Putin worries that he
is losing the war --- and in consequence loses his head. [But the
perpetual problem with restraint is the corresponding unwillingness to
consider what happens after America pulls back. Suppose Washington does
slash support to Ukraine and leave European security to the Europeans.
What does that bring? Judging by the past century --- or even the past
six months --- the answer is **not a stable Europe** and a more solvent
America. Rather,]{.underline} the result is likely to be a partially
[**successful Russian war of conquest** that creates **pervasive
insecurity** in Europe; a continent that, lacking **American
leadership**, is less united and confident in opposing Putin; and
greater **global instability** that ultimately makes it harder to
contain **China**, as well.]{.underline}

**CHAPTER 6 The Unipolar Era "If Sparta and Rome perished," the
philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau asked, "what State can hope to endure
forever?"1 The resounding answer given by history is "no state." In
time, perhaps in another century or so, the American empire will crumble
and new powers will rise. But we are not there yet, nor will we be for
many decades. [We are living in the unipolar era, and it will probably
outlive us.]{.underline} So what?** [The United States might be the most
powerful country in his- tory, but it has a limited presence in many
corners of the globe]{.underline}**, and weaker nations routinely
trample on U.S. interests.2 The United States failed to pre- vent the
9/11 terrorist attacks, the rise of the Islamic State, the Russian inva-
sion of Crimea, Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,
North Korean nuclear proliferation, and Chinese island-building in the
South China Sea. Unipolarity, bipolarity, multipolarity: What difference
does it make? In this final chapter, I explain why** [this view is
wrong]{.underline} **by highlighting several ways that unipolarity
transforms world politics. The good news is that [unipolarity
dramatically reduces the likelihood of great power war.]{.underline} The
bad news is that it may increase the likelihood of asymmetric conflict
and undermine American national unity and the liberal world order. [No
Hegemonic Rivalry]{.underline} The story of world politics is often told
as a game of thrones in which a rotating cast of great powers battles
for top-dog status. According to researchers led by Graham Allison at
Harvard,** [there have been sixteen cases in the past five hundred years
when a rising power challenged a rul- ing power.]{.underline}**3 Twelve
of these cases ended in carnage. One can quibble with Allison's case
selection, but the basic pattern is clear: hegemonic rivalry has sparked
a catastrophic war every forty years on average for the past half
millennium.** [The emergence of unipolarity in 1991 has put this cycle
of hegemonic competition on hold.]{.underline} **Obviously wars and
security competition still occur in today's unipolar world---in fact, as
I explain later, unipolarity has made certain types of asymmetric
conflict more likely---but** [none of these con- flicts have the global
scope or generational length of a hegemonic rivalry.]{.underline} **To
appreciate this point, just consider the Cold War---one of the four
"peaceful" cases of hegemonic rivalry identified by Allison's study.
Although the two superpowers never went to war, they divided the world
into rival camps, waged proxy wars that killed millions of people, and
pushed each other to the brink of nuclear Armageddon. For forty-five
years, World War III and human extinction were nontrivial possibilities.
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, by contrast, [the United States
has not faced a hegemonic rival, and the world, though far from perfect,
has been more peaceful and prosperous than ever before.]{.underline}
Just look at the numbers. From 1400 to 1991, the rate of war deaths
world- wide hovered between 5 and 10 deaths per 100,000 people and
spiked to 200 deaths per 100,000 during major wars.4 After 1991,
however,** [war death rates dropped]{.underline} **to 0.5 deaths per
100,000 people and have stayed there ever since. Interstate wars have
disappeared almost entirely, and the number of civil wars has declined
by more than 30 percent.5 Meanwhile,** [the global economy has
quadrupled in size]{.underline}**, creating more wealth between 1991 and
2018 than in all prior human history combined.6 What explains this
unprecedented outbreak of peace and prosperity? Some scholars attribute
it to advances in communications technology, from the printing press to
the telegraph to the Internet, which supposedly spread empathy around
the globe and caused entire nations to place a higher value on human
life.7 Such explanations are appealing, because they play on our natural
desire to believe in human progress, but are they convincing? Did humans
sud- denly become 10 to 20 times less violent and cruel in 1991? Are we
orders of magnitude more noble and kind than our grandparents? Has
social media made us more empathetic? Of course not, which is why the
dra- matic decline in warfare after 1991 is better explained by
geopolitics than sociology.8** [The collapse of the Soviet Union not
only ended the Cold War and related proxy fighting, it also opened up
large swathes of the world to democracy, international commerce, and
peacekeeping forces---all of which surged after 1991 and further
dampened conflict.]{.underline}**9 Faced with overwhelming U.S. economic
and military might,** [most countries have decided to work within the
American-led liberal order rather than fight to overturn
it.]{.underline}**10 As of 2018, nearly seventy countries have joined
the U.S. alliance network---a Kantian community in which war is
unthinkable---and even the two main challeng- ers to this community,
China and Russia, begrudgingly participate in the institutions of the
liberal order (e.g., the UN, the WTO, the IMF, World Bank, and the
G-20), engage in commerce with the United States and its allies, and
contribute to international peacekeeping missions.11 History may not
have ended in 1991, but it clearly changed in profound ways---and mostly
for the better.**

#### Renewed US leadership counters Russia and reinvigorates US hegemony

[The United States and its allies have failed to prevent Russia from
brutalizing Ukraine, but they can still win the larger struggle to save
the international order. Russia's savage invasion has exposed the gap
between Western countries' soaring liberal aspirations and the paltry
resources they have devoted to defend them.]{.underline} The United
States has declared great-power competition on Moscow and Beijing but
has so far failed to summon the money, the creativity, or the urgency
necessary to prevail in those rivalries. [Yet Russian President Vladimir
Putin has now inadvertently done the United States and its allies a
tremendous favor. In shocking them out of their complacency, he has
given them a historic opportunity to regroup and reload for an era of
intense competition---not just with Russia but also with China---and,
ultimately, to rebuild an international order that just recently looked
to be headed for collapse.]{.underline}

[This isn't fantasy: it has happened before. In the late 1940s, the West
was entering a previous period of great-power competition but had not
made the investments or initiatives needed to win it. U.S. defense
spending was pathetically inadequate, NATO existed only on paper, and
neither Japan nor West Germany had been reintegrated into the free
world. The Communist bloc seemed to have the momentum. Then, in June
1950, an instance of unprovoked authoritarian aggression---the Korean
War---revolutionized Western politics and laid the foundation for a
successful containment strategy. The policies that won the Cold War and
thereby made the modern liberal international order were products of an
unexpected hot war. The catastrophe in Ukraine could play a similar role
today.]{.underline}

### 1NC --NO POPULISM 

#### EU populism makes it inevitable

**Maher 17** (Richard Maher, Research Fellow, Global Governance
Programme, Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, European
University Institute. "Why populism is still a threat in Europe." World
Economic Forum. 12 Jun 2017
https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/06/populism-is-still-a-threat-in-europe-heres-why)

[Has the populist tide sweeping Europe crested]{.underline}? Six months
ago, many European leaders worried that the wave of popular discontent
that led to the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and propelled Donald
Trump into the White House could empower nationalist, anti-immigrant and
anti-EU parties across Europe, shaking the very foundations of the bloc.
Since then, however, populist movements have been turned back in
Austria, the Netherlands and France. German Chancellor Angela Merkel
looks likely to win her fourth term as chancellor in national elections
this September. And with a young, energetic, pro-EU French president now
in the Élysée Palace, some are predicting that the bloc is actually
poised for a comeback. But [it would [be a mistake to think]{.mark} that
[populism no longer represents]{.mark} a serious [threat to Europe and
the EU. Populist authoritarians are in power in Hungary and
Poland.]{.mark}]{.underline} Marine [Le Pen]{.underline} of the
far-right National Front [captured a third of the vote in the run-off of
France's election]{.underline} last month, and Geert [Wilders's
anti-Islam Freedom Party is the second most powerful seat-holder in
Holland's parliament. Even in Germany,]{.underline} long thought to be
resistant to right-wing populist currents, the anti-immigrant party
Alternative for Germany ([AfD]{.underline}) s[eems poised to gain
parliamentary representation for the first time]{.underline} following
national elections this year. And with early parliamentary elections
scheduled for October 15 [in Austria, it appears likely that the
far-right Freedom Party,]{.underline} which was formed in the 1950s by
former Nazis, [will enter into a government coalition with the
centre-right Austrian People's Party]{.underline}. A rise in populism
since the 1960s Post-war Europe has seen populist movements of both the
left and the right, but they have mainly operated on the margins of
national politics. While no populist party or politician has been able
to actually win a national election in Western Europe over the past
seven decades, research shows that [[populism]{.mark} has been
[advancing slowly]{.mark} yet steadily in Europe [since]{.mark} the
[1960s]{.mark}.]{.underline} Today, [virtually [every European country
has a populist party]{.mark}]{.underline} represented in national or
regional parliaments[. Most are right-wing]{.underline}, like Vlaams
Belang in Belgium, the National Front in France, Golden Dawn in Greece,
Lega Nord in Italy, the Freedom Party in the Netherlands, the Sweden
Democrats and the Swiss People's Party. These parties' aims and agendas
are driven by different national histories, traditions and
circumstances, but [all are anti-immigrant and anti-EU.]{.underline}
[[Populism's]{.mark} appeal remains too small to actually win elections
in most of Europe, but it is [shaping]{.mark} national and European
[politics in various ways]{.mark}]{.underline}, reframing debates on
immigration, the Eurozone and national security, among other examples.
[[Political views once considered]{.mark} extreme or [taboo are]{.mark}
now firmly [present in]{.mark} [mainstream political
discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}. In response, [some mainstream
politicians have co-opted parts of the populists' message or have felt
pressure to move to the right on some issues to blunt the populist
advance]{.underline}. To counter Wilders's anti-immigrant message, for
example, Dutch Prime Minister Mark [Rutte took a more hardline stance on
immigration and refugees]{.underline} in the weeks leading up to
parliamentary elections in March. Even Angela [Merkel has placed limits
on Germany's absorption of new refugees]{.underline} in light of
criticism from both the AfD and the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian
sister party of her Christian Democratic Union. The period from the
second world war to the present has been a remarkably stable one for
Western Europe. Governments have largely alternated between the
centre-right and the centre-left. With the rise of populist movements
and candidates, we are, in a way, restoring the historical norm: for
much of Europe's modern history, liberals and social democrats have
competed with populists of various stripes in national elections. What's
the plan? To effectively contain populism, Europe must accurately
diagnose how and why it emerged in the first place. This means they
cannot just ignore populists and their supporters, or ascribe their
grievances as the product of envy, resentment or blind rage. Those in
power must acknowledge constituents' genuine worries and anxieties about
immigration, national identity and terrorism, for example. Globalisation
has produced rapid economic and social disruptions. It has contributed
to economic displacement, rising income and wealth inequality, and what
seems to some people to be the homogenisation of national cultures. Many
people today face a level of economic insecurity that their parents or
grandparents did not experience. And with large-scale immigration, they
have legitimate concerns about the cultural and demographic future of
their countries. [The [sources]{.mark} for such concerns [are not likely
to disappear,]{.mark} so populism is more of a long-term challenge than
a temporary crisis]{.underline}. As Harvard's Yascha Mounk has said[,
"the [past two decades have represented]{.mark} not a populist moment
but rather [a populist turn]{.mark} --- one that will exert significant
influence on policy and public opinion for decades to
come."]{.underline}

### 1NC---NO RUSSIA CONFLICT

#### Russia can't escalate crisis \-\-- low military spending 

**Stratfor '19**- American geopolitical intelligence platform and

Defense Industry Finds Itself in a Tailspin," *Strafor Worldview*,
<https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/russias-defense-industry-finds-itself-tailspin)//BB>

[[Russia\'s defense industry is face to face with a major
foe]{.underline}]{.mark}, but it\'s not a foreign military power. [The
[Kremlin has been striving to modernize]{.mark} all branches of the
Russian military, [but]{.mark} the country\'s defense [industry is
struggling thanks to decreasing]{.mark} volumes of [orders, difficulties
in]{.mark} attracting high-skilled [talent and limits to]{.mark} its
[techn]{.mark}ological capabilities.]{.underline} According to recent
figures, [the performance of Russia\'s aerospace sector is declining
precipitously]{.underline}. In 2018, for instance, Russian aircraft and
spacecraft makers produced 13.5 percent less than in 2017. And there\'s
been no letup [in 2019]{.underline} either: In the first two months of
the year, [aerospace output plummeted 48 percent]{.underline} year on
year. [The [decline]{.mark} in Russia\'s defense output [raises concerns
about]{.mark} the competitive [strength]{.mark} of Russia\'s defense
industry in general, whose health is critical if the country is to
project itself [as a military power]{.mark}]{.underline} in the longer
term. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov attributed the
reduction in output to a slowdown of orders for military systems, but
projections suggest [the slowdown is not just a short-term
fluctuation]{.underline}; in fact, [it\'s expected to become even
worse]{.underline} in the future[. The [downturn in oil prices]{.mark}
has taken a bite out of Russia\'s bottom line, [squeezing
spending]{.mark} for the military]{.underline} --- all at a time when
the country\'s arms manufacturers have lost their competitive edge in
the global arms market. Together, these factors ensure that [Russia\'s
defense industry will struggle to get out of its funk]{.underline}.
Suffering From a Dearth of Funds This dire picture stands in stark
contrast to Russia\'s frequent presentation of sensational new
platforms. In reality, however, just a few of the big-ticket weapon
systems --- such as the T-14 main battle tank or the Su-57 fighter
aircraft --- find buyers, as the rest remain mere prototypes. Russia has
prioritized some hardware, such as the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic
missile, due to their strategic relevance to the country\'s overall
military posture, but Moscow has failed to fully develop other programs
or only introduced them on a limited scale. [Under pressure]{.underline}
from a limited government budget, [the [Kremlin even]{.mark} started
[reducing]{.mark} its [military spending]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2017
[--- a strong indicator that, **[despite the modernization push,
Russia\'s financial challenges are taking a toll on the country
ambitions]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Economically, the plunge in oil prices
at the end of 2014 hurt Russia\'s bottom line, depriving the country of
essential revenue and forcing it to dip into its reserves to bridge the
gap. Today, more than four years on, Russian oil revenues are rising,
yet the country is continuing to deal with the consequences of the lean
years. Beyond that, low revenues from taxes, which have forced Russia to
raise taxes and the retirement age, and Western sanctions over Moscow\'s
activities in Ukraine and elsewhere, have shrunk the financial pool
available to military planners. Low oil prices, declining revenues from
taxes and Western sanctions have taken a chunk out of the financial pool
available to Russia\'s military and the broader defense industry. But
the Kremlin\'s problems don\'t end there. In the past, Russia has
benefited from its position as a major global arms exporter to fuel
further military development. During the 1990s, for example, such sales
were critical to the country as it faced severe economic hardship. While
Russia remains the world\'s second-largest arms exporter (only the
United States sells more), the actual value of those exports has been
decreasing significantly. Between 2014 and 2018, their total value
dropped by as much as 17 percent. Again, budgetary limits are somewhat
to blame: [In the past, Russia frequently used arms exports as a
political tool]{.underline}, offering weapons at a heavy discount, if
not entirely free. [But]{.underline} with Russia no longer able to offer
customers a good deal on its fighter jets and other defense products,
[the country is **[losing business]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### No Russia war

Yet the surging [[fear over Russian adventurism distorts Moscow\'s
interests]{.mark} and ambitions]{.underline}. Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline} is a nasty fellow, brutal at home and abroad.
However, he [seems to well represent much of his country\'s power elite
and public]{.underline}. There is little apparent support for
Western-style liberalism. Oust Putin and \"le deluge\" to follow would
not likely be pretty. [[Putin\'s behavior]{.underline}]{.mark} is bad,
but [[poses **little threat**]{.mark}]{.underline} to America, \"old\"
Europe, or even most of Russia\'s neighbors. [He is behaving like a
traditional Tsar, not a reincarnated]{.underline} Joseph [Stalin
or]{.underline} Adolf [Hitler]{.underline}. He has taken Moscow back to
the Russian Empire, not the Soviet Union. [His [government]{.mark} is
[not interested in an ideological crusade]{.mark} [and sees no inherent
conflict]{.mark} with the West]{.underline}. [Rather, Moscow demands
respect for its status\], protection of Russia\'s borders, and
consideration of its interests]{.underline}. In pursuing these ends
[Putin is practical and measured]{.underline}, if perhaps imprudent and
myopic\--and, of course, dismissive of the cost to others. Mikhail
Saakashvili\'s Georgia was actively anti-Russian, pursued close ties
with America, and sought membership in NATO\--all certain to antagonize
Moscow. Abkhazia and South Ossetia had resisted Georgian control in the
past, giving Russia an easy means to weaken Tbilisi and pay back NATO
over the latter\'s dismemberment of Serbia, with historic ties to
Moscow. (Russia\'s defense of Belgrade helped turn an assassination into
World War I.) Ukraine always mattered more to Moscow than Georgia or the
Baltics for historical and cultural reasons, as well as the naval base
of Sebastopol. Nevertheless, Russia accepted an independent Ukraine,
even when ruled by the hostile, incompetent Viktor Yushchenko, who also
pushed for his nation\'s membership in the alliance\--then opposed by
the majority of Ukrainians. Yushchenko\'s failure opened the way for the
election of Viktor Yanukovich, nominally pro-Russian, though he resisted
Moscow\'s control. Putin acted only after Europe pushed a trade
agreement to reorient Ukraine away from Russia and both Brussels and
Washington backed a street revolution against Yanukovich. Even then,
[[Putin sought to weaken, **not conquer**, Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[He seized Crimea, historically part of Russia, and backed ethnic
Russian separatists in the east]{.underline}. [Despite **numerous
predictions**, Moscow did not absorb the Donbass, create a land bridge
to Crimea, stage a coup de\' main against Kiev, or launch a general
assault on Ukraine]{.underline}. His brutal response was murderous and
unjustified, but militarily on par with U.S. interventions.
[[Putin]{.mark} continues to [demonstrate no interest in ruling those
likely to]{.mark} [resist Russia\'s]{.mark} tender
[mercies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ukrainians and Georgians would not likely
act like docile Russian citizens today. Indeed, the former resisted the
restoration of Soviet control after German forces were expelled in World
War II. Nor was occupation necessary to bar those nations\' way to NATO.
Seizing the Baltic states likely would generate similar resistance. They
developed separate identities under the Russian Empire and enjoyed brief
independence between World Wars I and II. They also have the advantage
of having joined NATO before Moscow could cause much trouble. Moreover,
[as weak nations]{.underline} currently [containing no foreign troops,
the [Baltics pose no potential threat to Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Ukraine in NATO would look very different. Finally, the Baltic ethnic
Russian populations, though significant, demonstrate little sentiment
for joining Mother Russia. They prefer cultural connection to political
affiliation, creating a poor target for the sort of destabilizing
tactics deployed against Ukraine. Wrote Robert Person, a professor at
West Point: \"the Baltic Russians are not particularly amenable to
Russian hybrid warfare. Though they have many lingering grievances over
language, cultural and citizenship policies, these grievances have not
translated into separatism.\" So [**[what would Russia gain from
attacking]{.underline}**]{.mark} the Baltics? A recalcitrant, majority
non-ethnic Russian population. A possible temporary nationalist surge at
home. A likely short-lived victory over the West. [The [costs would be
**far greater**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Grabbing the Baltics
likely would spur population exodus and trigger economic collapse.
[Launching a war]{.underline} without the convincing pretext present in
the cases of Georgia and Ukraine [[might leave]{.mark} the [Russian
public angry]{.mark} over the retaliation certain to come]{.underline}.
[Worse, [Moscow]{.mark} certainly would [rupture economic and political
relations with the U.S. and Europe]{.mark} and]{.underline} probably
[start a **losing** conventional **war** with NATO]{.underline}. [Even
more frightening would be the prospect of a nuclear
conflict]{.underline}, whether intentional or inadvertent. Russia has
destroyed Europe\'s peaceful equilibrium, but **[everything about
[Putin\'s presidency]{.mark}]{.underline}** so far **[[argues against
reckless war]{.underline}]{.mark}** for no rational purpose against the
Baltics. Of course, they should act to reduce even minimal chances of
such a war. However, the U.S. should not launch a multi-billion dollar
allied build-up, one which, ironically, would create a perceived threat
to Russia where none currently exists. Could NATO lose a war over the
Baltics? As Rand warned, yes, at least in the short-term. But [the
allies could defeat Russia if they were prepared]{.underline} for World
War III. That would be beyond foolish for Washington\--another reason
why the U.S. should stop making defense promises which serve the
interests of other nations rather than America. If the Europeans, in
contrast, are ready to make that commitment, they should be preparing
their own defense.

#### No US-Russia war-- 7 reasons

[America is the mightiest military power in the world. And that fact
means absolutely nothing for the Ukraine crisis.]{.underline}
[[Regardless of whether Russia continues to occupy]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[Crimea]{.underline}]{.mark} region of Ukraine, [or]{.underline}
decides to occupy [all of Ukraine, [the U.S. is not going to]{.mark} get
into a shooting [war with Russia]{.mark}. This has nothing to do with
whether Obama is strong or weak]{.underline}. Jimmy Carter or Ronald
Reagan would face the same constraints. [The U.S. may]{.underline}
threaten to [impose economic sanctions, but]{.underline} here is why
America [will never smack Russia with a big stick]{.underline}: [[Russia
is a nuclear superpower]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia has an estimated
4,500 active nuclear warheads, according to the [Federation of American
Scientists](http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/nukes/nuclearweapons/nukestatus.html).
Unlike North Korea or perhaps Iran, whose nuclear arsenals couldn't
inflict substantial damage, [[Russia could]{.mark} totally [devastate
the U.S. as well]{.mark} as the rest of the planet. [U.S. missile
defenses]{.mark}, assuming they even work, [are not designed to stop
a]{.mark} massive [Russian strike]{.mark}. [For the]{.mark} 46 years of
[the Cold War]{.mark}, [America and Russia]{.mark} were deadly rivals.
But they [never fought]{.mark}]{.underline}. Their proxies fought:
Koreans, Vietnamese, Central Americans, Israelis and Arabs. [The one
time that U.S. and Soviet forces almost went to war was during the Cuban
Missile Crisis. Neither Obama nor Putin is crazy enough to want to
repeat that.]{.underline} [Russia has a powerful army]{.underline}.
[While the Russian military is a shadow of its Soviet glory days, it is
still a formidable force.]{.underline} The Russian army has about
300,000 men and 2,500 tanks (with another 18,000 tanks in storage),
according to the "[Military Balance
2014″](http://www.iiss.org/en/militarybalanceblog/blogsections/2014-3bea/january-1138/milbal-advertorial-dfa6)
from the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Its air force
has almost 1,400 aircraft, and its navy 171 ships, including 25 in the
Black Sea Fleet off Ukraine's coast. [U.S. forces are more
capable]{.underline} than Russian forces, which did not perform
impressively during the [2008 Russo-Georgia
War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_war). American troops
would enjoy better training, communications, drones, sensors and
possibly better weapons (though the latest Russian fighter jets, such as
the T-50, could be trouble for U.S. pilots). [However, better is not
good enough. The Russian military is not composed of lightly armed
insurgents]{.underline} like the Taliban, [or a hapless
army]{.underline} like the Iraqis in 2003. With advanced weapons like
T-80 tanks, supersonic AT-15 Springer anti-tank missiles, BM-30 Smerch
multiple rocket launchers and S-400 Growler anti-aircraft missiles,
[Russian forces pack enough firepower to inflict significant American
losses. Ukraine is closer to Russia.]{.underline} [The distance between
Kiev and Moscow is 500 miles. The distance between Kiev and New York is
5,000 miles. It's much easier for Russia to send troops and supplies by
land than for the U.S. to send them by sea or air. [The U.S. military is
tired.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[After]{.mark} nearly [13 years of
war]{.mark}, America's armed forces need a breather. [Equipment is worn
out]{.mark}]{.underline} from long service in Iraq and Afghanistan,
[[personnel are worn ou]{.mark}t]{.underline} from repeated deployments
overseas, [and there are still]{.underline} about [40,000
troops]{.underline} still fighting [in Afghanistan. [The U.S. doesn't
have many troops to send]{.mark}]{.underline}. T[he U.S. could easily
dispatch air power to Ukraine if its NATO allies allow use of their
airbases]{.underline}, and the aircraft carrier George H. W. Bush and
its hundred aircraft are patrolling the Mediterranean. [But for a ground
war to liberate Crimea or defend Ukraine, there is just the 173rd
Airborne Brigade in Italy, the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit sailing
off Spain, the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment in Germany and the 82nd
Airborne Division at Fort Bragg]{.underline}, North Carolina.
[While]{.underline} the [paratroopers could drop in]{.underline}to the
combat zone, [the Marines would have sail past Russian defenses in the
Black Sea, and the Stryker brigade would]{.underline} probably [have to
travel overland through Poland]{.underline} into Ukraine. Otherwise,
[bringing in mechanized combat brigades from the U.S. would be
logistically difficult, and]{.underline} more important, could [[take
months to organize]{.underline}.]{.mark} [[The American people are
tired]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Pity the]{.mark} poor [politician who
tries to sell the]{.mark} American [public on]{.mark} yet [another war,
especially some complex conflict in a]{.mark} distant Eastern
[Europ]{.mark}e nation]{.underline}. Neville Chamberlain's words during
the 1938 Czechoslovakia crisis come to mind: "How horrible, fantastic,
incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on
gas-masks here because of a quarrel in a far away country between people
of whom we know nothing." [[America's allies are
tired]{.underline}]{.mark}. [NATO sent troops to support the American
campaign in Afghanistan, and has little to show for it. Britain sent
troops to Iraq and Afghanistan, and has little to show for it. It is
almost inconceivable to imagine the Western European public marching in
the streets to demand the liberation of Crimea, especially considering
the region's sputtering economy]{.underline}, which might be snuffed out
should Russia stop exporting natural gas. [As for military capabilities,
the Europeans couldn't evict Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi without
American help. And Germans fighting Russians again? Let's not even go
there.]{.underline}

Ever since Putin
[[extolled]{.underline}](https://ria.ru/20211221/putin-1764712935.html)
the development of robotic combat systems in the new State Armaments
Program in 2020, the Russian Ministry of Defense has been hyper-focused
on AI. We have learned more about the Russian military's [[focus on
AI]{.underline}](https://www.cna.org/CNA_files/centers/CNA/sppp/rsp/russia-ai/Russia-Artificial-Intelligence-Autonomy-Putin-Military.pdf)
in the past year thanks to several public revelations. [But talk of AI
has been muted since the Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. Apart
from the widespread [[use of
UAVs]{.underline}](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2022/03/where-are-russias-drones/362612/)
for
[[reconnaissance]{.underline}](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-drones-russia-ukraine/)
and target acquisition and a single
[[display]{.underline}](https://t.me/milinfolive/80147) of a
mine-clearing robot---all of which are remote-controlled---[there is no
overt evidence of Russian AI in C4ISR or decision-making among the
Russian military forces]{.underline}, other than a single public
[[deepfake]{.underline}](https://www.wired.com/story/zelensky-deepfake-facebook-twitter-playbook/)
attempt to discredit the Ukrainian government. That [does not mean AI
isn't used, considering how Ukrainians are now]{.underline}
[[utilizing](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-ukraine-has-started-using-clearview-ais-facial-recognition-during-war-2022-03-13/)
artificial intelligence in data analysis---but there is a notable
absence of larger discussion about this technology in open-source
Russian media]{.underline}. The gap between Russian military aspirations
for high-tech warfare of the future and the [[actual
conduct]{.underline}](https://www.rferl.org/a/nuland-ukraine-incredible-losses/31777845.html)
of war today is becoming clear. In January 2021, Colonel-General
Vladimir Zarudnitsky, the head of the Military Academy of the Russian
Armed Forces General Staff, wrote that the development and use of
unmanned and autonomous military systems, the "robotization" of all
spheres of armed conflict, and the development of AI for robotics will
have the greatest medium-term effect on the Russian armed forces'
ability to meet their future challenges. Other MOD military experts also
[[debated]{.underline}](https://www.ndc.nato.int/research/research.php?icode=712)
the impact of these emerging technologies on the Russian military and
future balance of forces. Russia continued to upgrade and replace
Soviet-made systems, part of the MOD's
[[drive]{.underline}](https://www.cna.org/CNA_files/centers/CNA/sppp/rsp/russia-ai/Russia-Artificial-Intelligence-Autonomy-Putin-Military.pdf)
from "digitization" (weapons with modern information technologies for
C4ISR) to "intellectualization" (widespread implementation of AI capable
of performing human-like creative thinking functions). These and other
developments were covered in detail during Russia's "[[Army-2021"
conference]{.underline}](https://tass.ru/armiya-i-opk/12191791), with AI
as a key element in C4ISR at the tactical and strategic levels.
Meanwhile, Russian military developers and researchers worked on
[[multiple]{.underline}](https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/landwarfareintl/russians-hope-shturm-can-weather-ugv-problems/)
AI-enabled robotics projects, including the
"[[Marker]{.underline}](https://tass.ru/ekonomika/13181449)" concept
unmanned ground vehicle and its autonomous operation in groups and with
UAVs. Toward the end of 2021, the state agency responsible for exporting
Russian military technology even [[announced
plans]{.underline}](https://tass.ru/armiya-i-opk/13332043) to offer
unmanned aviation, robotics, and high-tech products with artificial
intelligence elements to potential customers this year. The agency
emphasized the equipment is geared toward defensive, border protection,
and counter-terrorism capabilities. [Since the invasion, things have
changed. Russia's defense-industrial complex---especially military
high-tech and AI research and development---may be affected by the
international]{.underline}
[[sanctions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/02/25/ukraine-russia-chips-sanctions-tsmc/)
and cascading effects of Russia being cut off from semi-conductor and
microprocessor imports]{.underline}. Throughout 2021, the Russian
government was pushing for the adoption of its AI civilian initiatives
across the country, such as nationwide
[[hackathons]{.underline}](https://iz.ru/1273011/2022-01-03/v-tekhnopolise-era-nachalsia-novogodnii-khakaton)
aimed at different age groups with the aim of making artificial
intelligence familiar at home, work, and school. The government also
pushed for the digital transformation of science and higher education,
emphasizing the development of AI, big data, and the internet of things.
Russian academic AI R&D efforts drove predictive analytics; development
of chat bots that process text and voice messages and resolve user
issues without human intervention; and technologies for working with
biometric data. Russia's development of [[facial
recognition]{.underline}](https://www.cna.org/centers/cna/sppp/rsp/russia-ai)
technology continued apace, with key efforts implemented across Moscow
and other large cities. AI as a key image recognition and data
analytical tool was used in many [[medical projects and
efforts]{.underline}](https://www.cna.org/centers/cna/sppp/rsp/russia-ai)
dealing with large data sets. Russian government officials
[[noted]{.underline}](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/13273673) their
country's efforts in promoting the ethics of artificial intelligence,
and expressed confidence in Russia's continued participation in this
UN-sponsored work. The Russian Council for the Development of the
Digital Economy has [[officially
called]{.underline}](https://www.interfax.ru/russia/811935) for a ban on
artificial intelligence algorithms that discriminate against people.
Russia's Ministry of Economic Development was asked to "create a
mechanism for assessing the humanitarian impact of the consequences of
the introduction of such \[AI\] technologies, including in the provision
of state and municipal services to citizens," and to prepare a "road
map" for effective regulation, use, and implementation. [[According
to]{.underline}](https://www.interfax.ru/russia/811935) the council,
citizens should be able to appeal AI decisions digitally, and such a
complaint should only be considered by a human. The council also
proposed developing legal mechanisms to compensate for damage caused as
a result of AI use. In October, Russia's leading information and
communications companies
[[adopted]{.underline}](https://ict.moscow/en/news/russias-leading-it-companies-adopt-the-national-code-of-ethics-in-the-field-of-ai/)
the National Code of Ethics in the Field of AI; the code was recommended
for all participants in the AI market, including government, business,
Russian and foreign developers. Among the basic principles in the code
are a [[human-centered
approach]{.underline}](https://ict.moscow/en/news/russias-leading-it-companies-adopt-the-national-code-of-ethics-in-the-field-of-ai/)
to the development of this technology and the safety of working with
data. AI workforce development was spelled out as a key requirement when
the government officially unveiled the national AI roadmap in 2019. A
2021 government
[[poll]{.underline}](https://www.cnews.ru/news/line/2021-12-24_issledovanie_64_spetsialistov)
that tried to gauge the level of confidence in the government's AI
efforts showed that only about 64 percent of domestic AI specialists
were satisfied with the working conditions in Russia. The survey
reflected the microcosm of AI research, development, testing, and
evaluation in Russia---[lots of government activity and different
efforts that did not automatically translate into a productive ecosystem
conducive for developing AI]{.underline}, some major efforts
notwithstanding. Among some of the
[[reasons]{.underline}](https://www.pnp.ru/economics/eksperty-nazvali-prepyatstviya-dlya-razvitiya-sfery-iskusstvennogo-intellekta-v-rossii.html)
in 2021 that [Russia was lagging behind in the development of artificial
intelligence technologies]{.underline} were [the personnel shortage and
the weakness of the venture capital market]{.underline}. The civilian
developer community also noted [the low penetration of Russian products
into foreign markets, dependence on imports, slow introduction of
products into business and government bodies, and a weak connection
between AI theory and practice]{.underline}. [Russia's likely plans to
concentrate on these areas in 2022 were revised or put on hold once
Russia invaded Ukraine]{.underline}. The [sudden]{.underline}
[[pull-out](https://www.cnet.com/news/politics/what-companies-have-left-russia-see-the-list-across-tech-entertainment-and-financial-institutions/)
of major IT and high-tech companies from Russia, coupled with

of Russia's IT workers, and the]{.underline}
[[ever-expanding](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-imposes-additional-russia-related-sanctions-treasury-website-2022-03-31/)
high-tech sanctions against the Russian state may hobble domestic AI
research and development for years to come]{.underline}. While the
Russian government is trying to [[prop
up]{.underline}](https://tass.ru/ekonomika/14234785) its AI and
high-tech industry with subsidies, funding, and legislative support,
[the impact of the above-mentioned consequences may be too much for the
still-growing and evolving Russian AI ecosystem]{.underline}. That does
not mean AI research and development will stop---on the contrary, many
2021 trends, efforts, and inventions [[are being
implemented]{.underline}](https://nauka.tass.ru/nauka/14212133) into the
Russian economy and society in 2022, and there are domestic high-tech
companies and public-private partnerships which are
[[trying]{.underline}](https://www.cnews.ru/articles/7-rossiyskih-analogov-inostrannomu-po)
to fill the
[[void]{.underline}](http://energyland.info/news-show--atom-226912) left
by the departed global IT majors. But the [effects of the invasion will
be felt in the AI ecosystem for a long time, especially with so many IT
workers]{.underline}
[[leaving](https://ria.ru/20220408/nauka-1782583365.html) the country,
either because of the massive impact on the high-tech economy, or
because they disagree with the war, or both]{.underline}. One of the
most-felt sanctions aftereffects has been the [severing of international
cooperation on AI among Russian universities and research
instructions]{.underline}, which earlier was enshrined as one of the
most important drivers for domestic AI R&D, and reinforced by support
from the Kremlin. For most high-tech institutions around the world, [the
impact of]{.underline} [[civilian
destruction](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-war-crimes-7791e247ce7087dddf64a2bbdcc5b888)
across Ukraine by the Russian military greatly outweighs the need to
engage Russia on AI]{.underline}. At the same time, much of the Russian
military AI R&D took place in a siloed environment---in many cases
behind a classified firewall and without significant public-private
cooperation---so it's hard to estimate just how sanctions will affect
Russian military AI efforts. While many in Russia now [[look to
China]{.underline}](https://tass.ru/ekonomika/13945187) as a substitute
for departed global commercial relationships and products, it's not
clear if Beijing could fully replace the software and hardware products
and services that left Russian markets at this point. Recent events may
not stop Russian civilians and military experts from discussing how AI
influences the conduct of war and peace---but [the]{.underline}
[[practical](https://www.cna.org/CNA_files/PDF/A%20Technological-Divorce-The-impact-of-sanctions-and-the-end-of-cooperation-on-Russias-technology-and-AI-sector.pdf)
implementation of these deliberations may become increasingly more
difficult for a country under global high-tech isolation]{.underline}.

### 1NC---REGS BAD

#### Overregulation kills new AI innovations---existing ones move to less regulated countries

Mark **Minevich**, 5/15/20**21** ('Going Global Ventures' president,
Boston Consulting Group adviser, IPsoft digital fellow and AI expert,
digital cognitive strategist, venture capitalist; Tech Crunch; "European
AI Needs Strategic Leadership, Not Overregulation";
<https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/european-ai-needs-strategic-leadership-not-overregulation///EF>)

The EU Commission recently proposed a [new set of stringent rules to
regulate
AI](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/business/artificial-intelligence-regulation.html),
citing an urgent need. [With the global race to regulate AI officially
on, the EU published a detailed proposal on how AI should be regulated,
explicitly banning some uses and defining those it considers
"high-risk," planning to ban the use of AI that threatens people's
rights and safety.]{.underline} We can all agree with the [sentiment of
Margrethe
Vestager](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_1682),
the European Commission executive vice president, when she said that
when it comes to "artificial intelligence, trust is a must, not a nice
to have," but is regulation the most effective and efficient way to
secure this reality? The [takeaways from the
commission](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_1682) are
incredibly in-depth, but the ones that make the most sense to me are
those that stress regulated AI should aim to increase human well-being.
[However, regulation should not overly constrain experimentation and
development of AI systems.]{.underline} High-risk AI systems should
always have unalterable built-in human oversight and control mechanisms.
AI systems intended to interact with people or to generate content,
whether high-risk or not, should be subject to specific transparency
obligations. In addition, AI-based remote biometric systems in publicly
accessible places shall be only authorized by EU or member state law and
serve the objective of preventing, detecting or investigating serious
crime and terrorism. Partnership between AI and humanity [The set of
laws and legal framework enacted in Europe will have a profound impact
on AI regulation around the world, similar to the effects the GDPR
regulations created over the past decade. But will these laws assist us
in moving away from the EU-wide haphazard regulatory approach toward a
singularity of common classification? In my opinion, this will cripple
AI development in the EU while China and the United States leap forward.
It would limit the use cases and innovation of artificial intelligence
and put the EU in a technologically inferior position globally. In the
U.S, AI is being optimized to maximize corporate profitability and
efficiency. In China, AI is being optimized to maximize the government's
grip on the population with the preservation of power. The overly
regulated environment in the EU will lead to complete chaos when
regulations in various EU bodies start contradicting.]{.underline}
Negative effects on EU entrepreneurship [A lack of investment in AI in
the EU is a major factor why the EU is [losing the AI race to the U.S.
and
China](https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-AI-Index-Report_Master.pdf)]{.underline}.
There are currently about 446 million people living in the EU and 331
million people living in the U.S. But in the EU, \$2 billion
was [invested](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1226538/ai-private-investments-by-area/) in
AI in 2020, while in the U.S., \$23.6 billion was invested[. If the EU
continues pushing with aggressive regulations and lack of funding, it
will enjoy global leadership in AI regulations, but I won't be surprised
if many European entrepreneurs decide to launch their startups in more
AI-friendly countries. To create an EU that is friendly to innovation
and entrepreneurs, we must create a collaborative network of AI pioneers
to lead the way. In turn, other nations will take advantage of the EU's
push toward strict regulations by fostering innovation and generating a
stronger hold on the future of global technology.]{.underline} A recent
World Bank report showed the [EU launched 38% of investigations into
data compliance in 2019, compared to only 12% in North
America.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/europe-wants-to-set-the-rules-for-ai-not-everyone-thinks-its-going-to-work/) [With
policies this stringent and burdensome to companies, it should be no
surprise if innovators and entrepreneurs begin to move to more
business-friendly parts of the globe. Regulation leads to
relegation]{.underline} The regulation proposal suggests fines of up
to [€20 million, or up to 4% of total annual
turnover ](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/draft-eu-regulation-for-artificial-7284484/)of
the AI provider for noncompliance. If we consider prior EU legislation
and subsequent lack of digital innovation, these proposed regulations
will cause chronic stagnation of digital innovation and adoption in the
EU bloc. [In short, if these regulations become law, the EU will not
become a pioneer but a laggard.]{.underline} The "real" use cases of AI
are yet to emerge, uncovering the true potential of AI. [The massive
bureaucracy for high-risk use cases will undercut any entrepreneurship
or bottom-up innovation efforts. With historical markers trending to
the [EU heading to a
recession](https://www.ft.com/content/e7152f72-2494-43fa-86fa-4a8236a4db12),
now is not the time to stifle innovation.]{.underline} If AI is to be
broadly accepted, we need a human face showing AI helping people solve
their problems and challenges. We must highlight engaging stories that
are true and showcase the real people behind them. For the population at
large to accept the potential of AI, they must see people like
themselves benefiting from the goodness of AI. AI funding means, above
all, startup funding. Startups form the bridge between the discovery and
development of disruptive technologies to their everyday use by the
general public. Europe is already doing a significant amount of
planning, but must accelerate. [European venture capital is lagging
behind the U.S.
model](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markminevich/2021/01/18/how-the-eu-is-leading-the-way-in-ai-powered-social-innovation/?sh=30675c956bb7).
Fast-growing startups are mostly dependent on American and Asian
investors. [This requires a rethinking of the investment culture and
sensible promotion of a dynamic investment environment; for example,
through the targeted relaxation of investment restrictions on the part
of institutional investors.]{.underline} We're living during the age of
"moonshots," a time when entrepreneurs and scientists are able to go
further than ever before. Competing in the next economy requires playing
a new innovation game, one whose goal is to boost innovation tenfold. In
order to reach this level, incremental optimizations do not help. The
focus needs to pivot to big innovations --- moonshots. Taking risk is
acceptable and implementation of a large and risky idea should become
normal. [To create an EU that is friendly to innovation and
entrepreneurs, we must create a collaborative network of AI pioneers to
lead the way.]{.underline} Entrepreneurs and data science leaders must
use their energies to focus on AI for good to improve the world in the
longer term and advocate for deregulation. To accomplish this, we need
to set up a global AI pioneers council on AI for good, consisting of
participants from leading research institutions, businesses, the public
sector and civil society to develop a shared understanding of best
practices. AI is no longer just a tool for optimizing corporate systems
and societal infrastructures; its potential reaches much further into
solving the various crises facing mankind, from climate change to
uncontrolled pandemics. Responsible AI and AI for good application
across all the world's superpowers can address these crises. [The EU
cannot afford to be the region of the globe disincentivizing innovation
and discouraging entrepreneurship. The EU must move not toward super
regulation, but toward strategic leadership of AI based on AI for good.
The path of overregulation leads to the depths of stagnation. It is up
to the EU to decide what it wants its future to look like.]{.underline}

#### AI regulations hurt US-European geopolitical standing---current regulation views are divergent

Samuel **Stolton**, 1/15/20**20** (Euractiv; "Avoid heavy AI regulation,

[The US administration has urged European lawmakers to avoid heavy

White House put forward a set of regulatory principles aimed at avoiding
the overregulation of Artificial Intelligence technologies in the
private sector[. In a statement, the US said AI regulation should not be
pursued until risk assessment exercises and cost-benefit analyses have
been carried out, adding that the government hopes its European
counterparts would adopt a similar approach.]{.underline} "Europe and
our allies should avoid heavy-handed innovation-killing models, and
instead consider a similar regulatory approach," a statement from the
White House read. ["The best way to counter authoritarian uses of AI is
to make sure America and our international partners remain the global
hubs of innovation, shaping the evolution of technology in a manner
consistent with our common values."]{.underline} In a call with
reporters ahead of the news, the US's Chief Technology Officer Michael
Kratsios said America is leading the way in shaping the AI revolution
"in a way that reflects our values of freedom, human rights, and civil
liberties." "We encourage Europe to use the U.S. AI principles as a
framework," Kratsios said, referring to the Commission's forthcoming AI
strategy. "The best way to counter authoritarian uses of AI is to make
America and our national partners remain the global hub of innovation,
advancing our common values," he added, revealing that he brought up the
issue with the EU's digital tsar Margrethe Vestager during their meeting
at Lisbon's Web Summit in November. Kratsios is set to formally announce
America's AI principles on Wednesday at the CES convention in Las Vegas.
**European landscape** Meanwhile, European countries continue to pursue
a divergent approach to AI technologies. Over the weekend, a report from
the German weekly news magazine Der Spiegel revealed that a draft law by
the interior ministry is set to expand the competencies of the federal
police force, in rolling out facial recognition technologies at 135
train station and 14 airports across the country. This introduction of
the draft law follows a series of testing periods in the country over
the past few years that have seen a number of tech firms taking part in
the process, including German outfits IBM Deutschland, Funkwerk, and the
G2K Group, in addition to Japan's Hitachi consortium -- featuring
several multinational tech companies. Elsewhere in Europe, concerns have
been raised about facial recognition technologies by data protection
authorities in Sweden and France, as well as the EU's European Data
Protection Supervisor. There has also been a sense of disquietude in
France surrounding the country's new ID programme, 'Alicem', which will
employ facial recognition technologies for identity verification
purposes. However, France's Secretary of State for Digital Cédric O has
recently adopted a more cautious approach to the project's take-off in
France, in an interview with [Le
Parisien](http://www.leparisien.fr/high-tech/reconnaissance-faciale-cedric-o-n-est-pas-certain-qu-alicem-soit-un-jour-deployee-24-12-2019-8223705.php).
In Brussels, a report published [in
June](https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/adverse-impacts-of-artificial-intelligence-could-pave-way-for-regulation-eu-report-says/) by
the Commission's High-Level Group on AI suggested that the EU  should
consider the need for new regulation to "ensure adequate protection from
adverse impacts." This could include issues arising from biometric
recognition, the use of lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS), AI
systems built on children's profiles, and the impact AI may have on
fundamental rights. In terms of how AI technologies could impact
consumer rights, Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders told his
parliamentary hearing in October he would advocate for
an **'**ethics-by-design**'** approach, whereby products and services
using AI take into account ethical guidelines at the earliest possible
stage in their development. For her part, the EU's digital chief,
Margrethe Vestager,
told [EURACTIV](https://www.euractiv.com/section/copyright/news/vestager-takes-aim-at-biopower-of-tech-giants/) in
November that "great opportunities come with great risks," but that she
has "strong reservations" with the 'blanket' application of some
technologies in Artificial Intelligence technologies in particular, such
as facial recognition software. [The US statement on Tuesday follows the
recent passing of new rules to restrict the exports of American
Artificial Intelligence technologies, which the administration hopes
will keep rival governments from taking advantage of US
innovation.]{.underline} The new measures, which came into force on
Monday (6 January), mean that firms exporting types of geospatial
imagery software from the US have to apply for a license to send it
abroad.

### 1NC---MILITARY AI TURN

#### Military a goes bad- can escalate scenarios & other warrants

[Even if military AI systems are adequately tested, the use of AI to
enable more autonomous machine behavior in military systems raises an
additional set of risks. In delegating decision-making from humans to
machines, policymakers may de facto be fielding forces with less
flexibility and ability to understand context, which would then have
**deleterious effects on crisis stability and managing
escalation**.]{.underline} While machines have many advantages in speed,
precision, and repeatable actions, [machines today cannot come close to
human intelligence in understanding context and flexibly adapting to
novel situations. This brittleness of machine decision-making may
particularly be a challenge in pre-conflict crisis situations, where
tensions among nations run high]{.underline}. Military forces from
competing nations regularly interact in militarized disputes below the
threshold of war in a variety of contested regions (e.g., the
India-Pakistan border, China-India border, South China Sea, Black Sea,
Syria, etc[.). These interactions among deployed forces sometimes run
the risk of escalation due to incidents or skirmishes that can inflame
tensions on all sides. This poses a challenge for national leaders, who
have imperfect command-and-control over their own military forces.
Today, however, deployed military forces rely on human decision-making.
Humans can understand broad guidance from their national leadership and
commander's intent, such as "defend our territorial claims, but don't
start a war.]{.underline}" Relative to humans, [even the most advanced
AI systems today have no ability to understand broad guidance, nor do
they exhibit the kinds of contextual understanding that humans
frequently label "common sense.]{.underline}"27 [Militaries already
employ uninhabited vehicles (drones) in contested areas, which have been
involved in a number of escalatory incidents in the East China Sea,
South China Sea, Syria, and Strait of Hormuz]{.underline}.28 Over time,
as militaries incorporate more autonomous functionality into uninhabited
vehicles, that functionality could complicate interactions in these and
other contested areas. [Autonomous systems may take actions based on
programming that]{.underline}, while not a malfunction, [are other than
what a commander would have wanted a similarly situated human to do in
the same situation]{.underline}. While the degree of flexibility
afforded subordinates varies considerably by military culture and
doctrine, humans have a greater ability to flexibly respond to complex
and potentially ambiguous escalatory incidents in ways that may balance
competing demands of ensuring national resolve while managing
escalation.29 [Autonomous systems will simply follow their programming,
whatever that may be, even if those rules no longer make sense or are
inconsistent with a commander's intent in the given
situation.]{.underline} This challenge is compounded by the fact that
[human commanders cannot anticipate all of the possible situations that
forward-deployed military forces in contested regions may face.
Employing autonomous systems in a crisis effectively forces human
decision makers to tie their own hands with certain pre-specified
actions, even if they would rather not.]{.underline} [Unintended actions
by autonomous systems in militarized disputes or contested areas are a
challenge for militaries]{.underline} as they adopt more autonomous
systems into their forces. The complexity of many autonomous systems
used today, even ones that rely on rule-based decision-making, may mean
that the [humans employing autonomous systems lack sufficient
understanding of what actions the system may take in certain
situations.]{.underline}30 Humans' ability to flexibly interpret
guidance from higher commanders, even to the point of disregarding
guidance if it no longer seems applicable, is by contrast a boon to
managing escalation risks by retaining human decision-making at the
point of interaction among military forces in contested regions.31
[Unintended escalation is not merely confined to lethal actions, such as
firing on enemy forces. Nonlethal actions, such as crossing into another
state's territory, can be **perceived as escalatory**. Even if such
actions do not lead directly to war, they could **heighten tensions,
increase suspicion** about an adversary's intentions, or **inflame
public sentiment**]{.underline}. While in most cases, humans would still
retain agency over how to respond to an incident, [competing autonomous
systems could create unexpected interactions or **escalatory
spirals**.]{.underline} Complex, interactive dynamics between algorithms
have been seen in other settings, including financial markets,32 and
even in situations where the algorithms are relatively simple.33
[Another problem stems from the potential inability of humans to call
off autonomous systems once deployed.]{.underline} One reason for
employing autonomous functionality is so that uninhabited vehicles can
continue their missions even if they are operating without reliable
communication links to human controllers. [When there is no
communication link between human operators and an autonomous system,
human operators would have no ability to recall the autonomous system if
political circumstances changed such that the system's behavior was no
longer appropriate. This could be a challenge in de-escalating a
conflict, if political leaders decide to terminate hostilities but have
no ability to recall autonomous systems, at least for some period of
time. The result could be a continuation of hostilities even after
political leaders desire a cease-fire.]{.underline} Alternatively, the
inability to fully cease hostilities could undermine truce negotiations,
leading to the continuation of conflict. These problems are not unique
to autonomous systems. Political leaders have imperfect
command-and-control over human military forces, which has, at times, led
to similar incidents with human-commanded deployed forces. For example,
the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812 was fought after a peace
treaty ended the war because of the slowness of communications to
deployed forces.

 

#### Further adoption of AI into military means hyperwar- even if not LAWS- causes escalation

[It is reasonable and, in fact, vital to examine whether the integration
of AI into warfare might also pose risks that policymakers should
attend]{.underline}. Some [AI researchers themselves have raised alarm
at militaries' adoption of AI and the way it could increase the risk of
war and international instability.]{.underline}5 Understanding risks
stemming from military use of AI is complicated, however, by the fact
that AI is not a discrete technology like missiles or submarines. As a
general-purpose technology, AI has many applications, any of which
could, individually, improve or undermine stability in various ways.
Militaries are only beginning the process of adopting AI, and [in the
near term, military AI use is likely to be limited and
incremental]{.underline}. Over time, the [cognization of warfare through
the introduction of artificial intelligence could change warfare in
profound ways]{.underline}, just as industrial revolutions in the past
shaped warfare.6 [Even if militaries successfully manage safety and
security concerns and field AI systems that are robust and secure,
properly functioning AI systems could create challenges for
international stability.]{.underline} For example, [both Chinese and
American scholars have hypothesized that the introduction of AI and
autonomous systems in combat operations could accelerate the tempo of
warfare beyond the pace of human control. Chinese scholars have referred
to this concept as a battlefield "singularity,"7 while some Americans
have coined the term "**hyperwar"**]{.underline} to refer to a similar
idea.8 [If warfare evolves to a point where the pace of combat outpaces
humans' ability to keep up, and therefore control over military
operations must be handed to machines, it would pose **significant risks
for international stability,** even if the delegation decision seems
necessary due to competitive pressure. Humans might lose control over
managing escalation, and war termination could be significantly
complicated if machines fight at a pace that is faster than humans can
respond.]{.underline} In addition, [delegation of escalation control to
machines could mean that minor tactical missteps or accidents that are
part and parcel of military operations in the **chaos and fog of war,**
including **fratricide, civilian casualties, and poor military
judgment**, could spiral out of control and reach **catastrophic
proportions** before humans have time to intervene.]{.underline} Even if
militaries successfully manage safety and security concerns and field AI
systems that are robust and secure, properly functioning AI systems
could create challenges for international stability. [The logic of a
battlefield singularity, or hyperwar, is troubling precisely because
competitive pressures could drive militaries to accelerate the tempo of
operations and remove humans "from the loop," even if they would rather
not, in order to keep pace with adversaries]{.underline}. Then-Deputy
Secretary of Defense Robert Work succinctly captured this dilemma when
he posed the question, ["If our competitors go to Terminators \... and
it turns out the Terminators are able to make decisions faster, even if
they're bad, how would we respond?"]{.underline}9 [While this "arms race
in speed" is often characterized tactically in the context of lethal
autonomous weapon systems, the **same dynamic** could emerge
operationally involving **algorithms designed as decision
aids.**]{.underline} [The perception by policymakers that war is
evolving to an era of machine-dominated conflict in which humans must
cede control to machines to remain competitive could also hasten such a
development,]{.underline} particularly if [decision makers lack
appropriate education about the limits of AI.]{.underline} In extremis,
the [shift toward the use of algorithms for military decision-making,
combined with a more roboticized battlefield, could potentially change
the nature of war.]{.underline} War would still be the continuation of
politics by other means in the broadest sense, but [in the most extreme
case it might feature so little human engagement that it is no longer a
fundamentally human endeavor.]{.underline}

#### Military AI lack of human cognition psychology card- not great but could be useful- doesn't necessarily bad just says scary which is fair tbh

and National Security Program at the Center for a New American Security

The [widespread adoption of AI could have a net effect on international
stability]{.underline} in other ways. [AI systems could change strategy
in war, including by substituting machines for human decision-making in
some mission areas, and therefore **removing certain aspects of human
psychology** from parts of war]{.underline}.11 Warfare today is waged by
humans through physical machinery (rockets, missiles, machine guns,
etc.), but [decision-making is almost universally human]{.underline}.
[As algorithms creep closer to the battlefield, some decisions will be
made by machines even if warfare remains a human-directed activity that
is fought for human political purposes]{.underline}. The [widespread
integration of machine decision-making across tactical, operational, and
strategic levels of warfare could have **far-reaching
implications**]{.underline}. Already, [AI agents playing real-time
computer strategy games]{.underline} such as StarCraft and Dota 2 [have
**demonstrated superhuman aggressiveness**, precision, and
coordination.]{.underline} In other strategy games such as poker and go,
AI agents have demonstrated an ability to radically adjust playing
styles and risk-taking in ways that would be, at best, challenging for
humans to mimic for psychological reasons. [AI dogfighting agents have
similarly demonstrated superhuman precision and employed different
tactics because of the ability to take greater risk to
themselves.12]{.underline} In many ways, [AI systems have the ability to
be the perfect strategic agents, **unencumbered by fear, loss aversion,
commitment bias,** or other human emotional or cognitive biases and
limitations.]{.underline}13 While the [specific algorithms and models
used for computer games are unlikely to transfer well to combat
applications, the general characteristics and advantages of AI agents
relative to humans could have applications in the military
domain]{.underline}. As in the case of speed, [the net consequence of
machine decision-making on the psychology of combat could change the
character of warfare in profound ways.14]{.underline}

### 1NC---NATO BAD

#### NATO [fails at deterrence]{.underline} but [antagonizes]{.underline} Russia and China.

NATO EXPANSION---TOWARD OR AGAINST RUSSIA?

[A]{.underline}nother [constant feature of U.S. policy toward Russia has
been the **primacy of NATO as the cornerstone** of the post--Cold War
European security architecture, including its **expansion to some of the
former Soviet states**]{.underline}. Since the end of the Cold War,
[NATO enlargement has been the **principal instrument of U.S. security
policy**]{.underline} in Europe and Eurasia. It reflects a U.S.
commitment to a whole, free, democratic, and peaceful Europe, as well as
a view that the alliance should serve as the vehicle of the continent's
post--Cold War transformation. What went largely unnoticed were Moscow's
warnings beginning in 1994 that a "whole Europe" was not compatible with
an expanding NATO, which would never be open to Russia.

[Although NATO's expansion has **not necessarily been directed against
Russia**, it has negatively affected the Kremlin's assessment of U.S.
motivations and intentions and has been met with strong
**objections**]{.underline} from Russians [across the political
spectrum. NATO enlargement also has shaped Russia's perceptions of its
**own security requirements**, which have had a profound impact on
East-West relations]{.underline}. The issue is whether the U.S.
transatlantic commitment necessitates the alliance's continued eastward
expansion and Open Door policy.31

The Clinton administration launched NATO expansion in 1997 when it led
the alliance to offer memberships to Poland, the Czech Republic, and
Hungary---a policy that the George W. Bush and Obama administrations
subsequently embraced. In addition to extending a security umbrella to
former Soviet bloc countries, NATO membership encouraged their domestic
postcommunist transition to democracy. NATO was and remains an alliance
based on shared democratic values. And since, as Clinton declared in his
1994 State of the Union address, "democracies do not attack each other,"
the democratic transitions of new NATO members would strengthen European
security. In this way, [NATO]{.underline} also [became an instrument of
**democracy promotion**]{.underline}.32

[Russia has opposed NATO enlargement almost from the time it was raised
as a possibility]{.underline} in the early 1990s.33 [The Kremlin has
maintained that NATO's push to the east threatened Russian security and
the alliance's central role in Europe's security architecture
**marginalized Russia as a nonmember**]{.underline}. However, Russia's
objections proved insufficient to halt the alliance's expansion; most
officials and observers in the West treated such opinions as remnants of
the old Soviet ideology that Russia would shed as it transitioned to a
free market, liberal democracy. For those who did not believe that
Russia would make this transition, NATO expansion made all the more
sense as a hedge against Russia reemerging as a threat to Europe---a
prospect that loomed ever larger as Russia recovered a good measure of
its economic health, authoritarian-leaning domestic politics, and
geopolitical ambitions.34 In 2007, [Putin]{.underline} personally
[delivered an ominous warning to NATO **not to expand further
east**]{.underline}, though most in the West regarded such rhetoric as
an outdated blast from the Cold War era.35 Even though [the alliance's
**dual purpose**]{.underline}---as a defense organization and instrument
of democracy promotion---[had emerged as a **major irritant** in the
United States' relations with Russia]{.underline}, Putin's warning
effectively was dismissed.36

In 2008, [NATO promised membership to Ukraine and Georgia, crossing the
**red line**]{.underline} that Putin had drawn around the territory of
the former Soviet states.37 In the eyes of U.S. policymakers, [NATO
was]{.underline} in effect [the **only legitimate** and **viable
security manager**]{.underline} for Europe and Eurasia, and its
expansion was the only sensible policy for the entire region.38 [Putin's
response was]{.underline} the 2008 [**war with Georgia**, which
**reaffirmed the red line**]{.underline} around the former Soviet space,
stopped NATO's eastward expansion, and marked a major turning point in
European security and in the relationship between NATO and Russia.39 In
2014, the annexation of Crimea and [Russia's]{.underline} undeclared
[war against Ukraine symbolized the]{.underline} end of the post--Cold
War era and the [reemergence of a new East-West divide in
Europe]{.underline}.

Could this outcome have been avoided? NATO expansion undoubtedly
benefited many countries of Central and Eastern Europe, providing a
much-needed security framework for the region when it was left without
one in the aftermath of the Cold War. It also played an important role
in consolidating these former Soviet bloc countries' transition from
communism. But [one size **does not fit all**]{.underline}. Political
culture, history, geography, culture, and economic ties are crucially
important in shaping individual countries' trajectories. [The ties
between Georgia, Ukraine, and Russia---and Moscow's **strenuous
objections to NATO membership** for these former Soviet
republics---mattered little to the]{.underline} George W. [Bush
administration]{.underline} or to the president, who reportedly lobbied
for both countries to be admitted to NATO over many NATO allies' major
reservations.40

The promise of membership to Ukraine and Georgia---without a date or
plan for their accession---was made as a compromise between Bush and
many other NATO leaders, most notably German Chancellor Angela Merkel,
who were opposed to the idea. The promise was vague and lacked concrete
details. However, it was significant as a symbol of U.S. and NATO
commitments to the policy of NATO's eastward expansion regardless of any
red lines drawn by Putin.

When [Putin spoke about the breakup of the Soviet Union as the greatest
geopolitical catastrophe]{.underline} of the twentieth century, [his
message resonated with its intended domestic audience, reflecting
**widely held opinions**]{.underline} among average Russians---a fact
overlooked by Western policymakers.41 In retrospect, these warning signs
were harbingers of future strife. [But in the prevailing atmosphere of
the West's post--Cold War **triumphalism**]{.underline}, [they were
repeatedly **dismissed** as Russia's atavistic attachment to an
outdated, obsolete past]{.underline} rather than a vision of its
future.42

With the 2008 promise of membership to Georgia and Ukraine, the United
States led NATO across an invisible but distinct line. [None of the
other Soviet bloc countries that joined NATO]{.underline} after the Cold
War [had ties to Russia comparable to those of **Ukraine** and
**Georgia**]{.underline}. The countries of Central Europe had been part
of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Poland reemerged as an independent state
after World War I and had an adversarial relationship with the Soviet
Union until it was crushed by Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler. [The
Baltic states]{.underline} had long been part of the Russian Empire, but
they [had closer ties to the German than to the Russian
world]{.underline}. Following two decades of independence, they were
forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1939, and they viewed
Russia as an occupying power---a sentiment that survived Soviet
occupation and propelled them to freedom in the late 1980s, helping to
unravel the Soviet Union.

[Ukraine and Georgia share a **different history**]{.underline} with
Russia. Until 1991, [Ukraine had been part of imperial and]{.underline}
later [Soviet Russia for]{.underline} more than [**three hundred
years**. It was the empire's **industrial heartland**, home to its
defense industry and breadbasket, and a bridge to the outside world.
Georgia became a]{.underline} Russian [protectorate in 1783]{.underline}
and part of the Russian Empire in 1801. Unlike the Baltic countries,
[both were **integral parts of the Russian Empire**]{.underline} and the
Soviet Union, and although both countries gave rise to powerful
independence movements and played critical roles in the dissolution of
the USSR, [many of those ties survive]{.underline} to the present day,
[even after Russia went to war against both]{.underline} countries to
keep them in its orbit.43

NATO's 2008 pledge of eventual membership to Georgia and Ukraine was a
powerful restatement of its Open Door policy. For both countries---and
perhaps for other Soviet states harboring similar hopes---it was taken
as a Western promise to help them escape Russia's orbit. But for Russia,
[it was seen as another perilous sign of NATO's **boundless
ambitions**]{.underline}, and [it raised the prospect that it would
**lose control**]{.underline}, or at least immediate influence, [over
two neighbors that it saw as **critical to its security**, well-being,
and prestige as a major power.]{.underline}44 Given the alliance's
commitment to spreading democracy, [Russia also perceived its neighbors'
intended accession as a threat to its **domestic
stability**]{.underline}. Thus, the U.S. rejection of Russia's
geopolitical concerns as "atavistic" overlooked Russian sensitivities.45
Russia's response to it was an outright repudiation of several key
assumptions underpinning the original arguments for expansion---that
Russia would gradually change its views, come to share the alliance's
founding values, and eventually accept NATO's eastward push as it was
intended by its proponents; in other words, Moscow would see expansion
as a move toward Russia, rather than against it.

[Russia's opposition to NATO's eastward push **lived up to the
expectations**]{.underline} of those who argued for the expansion as a
hedge against a resurgent, irredentist Russia. However, [the architects
of expansion had **not thought through the consequences**]{.underline}
of that scenario. [Having made the promise]{.underline} of membership to
Georgia and Ukraine and encouraged their aspirations to join NATO, [the
alliance had not planned for and **did not come to their
defense**]{.underline} when the two became victims of Russian
aggression. [The alliance had made a political but not legal commitment
to their security]{.underline}. In effect, [NATO chose to hide behind
this **narrow legalistic interpretation of its
obligations**]{.underline} to member states, [rather than act upon the
expansive political commitments that permeated the **official
declarations**]{.underline} and speeches of its leaders.46

In choosing inaction, [NATO reaffirmed]{.underline} what had long been
obvious to many observers---that [it was **not committed to the
two**]{.underline} countries' security. [Russia's wars against Georgia
and Ukraine demonstrated the importance of **interests as drivers of
Russian**, U.S., and NATO actions: Russia had **more at stake in both
Georgia and Ukraine** than the United States and NATO and was **prepared
to go to war** to protect those equities]{.underline}. The United States
and its [NATO]{.underline} allies [did not see their stake in Ukraine
and Georgia]{.underline}, or their commitment to shared values, [as
important enough to warrant war]{.underline} with Russia.

Moreover, in promising membership to Georgia and Ukraine to join NATO in
the first place, the leaders of the alliance seemed to overlook the
importance of geography. Even the most ardent advocates of NATO
expansion recognize now that geographic proximity to Russia has been a
powerful obstacle to realizing their aspirations of NATO membership and
the alliance's eastward push. Russia's proximity to both countries has
endowed it with a formidable military advantage, and the alliance would
face a daunting challenge in overcoming that advantage if it chose to
come to either country's defense in a conflict with Russia. That
challenge has been made abundantly clear by the ongoing discussion among
defense experts about how the alliance would be able to defend the
Baltic states in a hypothetical future conflict with Russia, given the
latter's overwhelming geographic advantages in such a conflict.47

Finally, the [costs and benefits to the alliance of NATO]{.underline}
enlargement, [as well as the overall geopolitical context, have
**changed**]{.underline} since the early 1990s in two fundamental ways.
First, [the promise of a Europe whole, free, and at peace]{.underline}
with itself and its neighbors, which seemed within reach in the
aftermath of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, [has
been replaced with a new division in Europe between Russia and NATO.
Several countries]{.underline} that belong to neither camp [are now
stuck in a **geopolitical no man's land**]{.underline}, [unwilling to
return to Russia's sphere of influence but unable to reach out to an
alliance whose promises of protection are **vague at
best**]{.underline}. Second, at the time of NATO's first wave of
enlargement in the 1990s, the prospect of a NATO-Russia military
confrontation seemed to have been relegated to Europe's past, and NATO
was preparing to go "out of area."48 Today, NATO officials and military
planners are deeply preoccupied with augmenting capabilities to defend
alliance territory against Russian aggression. As a consequence, [the
costs of opening NATO's door to Europe's east have risen
**dramatically**]{.underline} with respect to new members and aspiring
applicants. With the alliance focused on dealing with the new division
of Europe and the adversarial relationship with Russia, [the prospect of
membership for Georgia and Ukraine has been pushed into a **distant**,
**indefinite future**.]{.underline}

#### That causes [Russia and China]{.underline} to create an [Axis of Evil]{.underline} against the US.

Putin's war against Ukraine, preceded by his demands for the United
States and its NATO allies to fundamentally alter post--Cold War
European security arrangements, has dispelled all doubts---to the extent
that any remained---about the primacy of Europe as the principal theater
where Russia's strategic interests reside, from where the principal
threats to the country's security emanate, and where the principal
efforts to defend it from those threats are concentrated. As a critical
strategic theater, Asia pales in comparison with Europe. The attack on
Ukraine demonstrates the dominance of Europe and the unimportance of
Asia---beyond China---in Russian strategic thinking.

Prior to the war in Ukraine, the view that Russian strategic thinking
was myopic and misguided was widespread in the U.S. national security
community. According to this view, the real threat to Russia in the
medium and long term would emerge from China rather than the West.
Sooner or later, the Russian strategic community would realize that. And
the sooner it could be disabused of its mistaken approach to China, the
better for the United States, whose interests would be best served by
preventing Russia from becoming an ally and force multiplier of China.
U.S. policy, therefore, should de-emphasize rivalry with Russia and
instead seek to drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing. In other
words, it was a policy prescription for a partnership with Russia on the
basis of perceiving a shared threat from China.

That prescription is no longer viable. However, for many years before
the invasion of Ukraine, Western analysts and policymakers ignored the
basic fact that [Russia's partnership with China is not a short-term
marriage of convenience but grounded in a set of coherent,
complementary, and **well-thought-out strategic rationales**. This
should have been **obvious**]{.underline} [to anyone who followed the
strategic discourse in Russia]{.underline}, read its national security
documents, and sought to understand the basics of its domestic politics,
national security decisionmaking, and economy.

One striking aspect of the Russian national security discourse largely
overlooked by many in the U.S. strategic community is its all-consuming
preoccupation with perceived threats from the West. [Insecurity
vis-à-vis the West has been the **defining feature of official security
documents**]{.underline} since the 1990s, when the United States and
Europe considered the Cold War to be over. In Russia, by contrast, [the
West's security policy has always been viewed as a
**continuation**]{.underline} in one form or another [of its Cold War
policies]{.underline}, initially as a "Cold War light" version, but
increasingly as a manifestation of the West's hostile intentions toward
Russia.

Another striking aspect of Russian national security documents that has
been overlooked is the absence in them of any references to China as a
challenge, let alone a potential source of threats to Russia. [As alarm
about China and its growing ambitions]{.underline} on the world stage
[became louder]{.underline} in the United States, [Russia's national
security documents **avoided any mention**]{.underline} of the country
other than as a partner, [and instead increasingly concentrated on the
West as the **principal source of threats**]{.underline}. These
documents, however, reflect the actual thinking of the country's
national security leadership and its strategic posture.

This paper first provides an overview of these documents, their
evolution since the breakup of the Soviet Union, and the strategic
backdrop to that evolution. It then focuses on the treatment of China in
these documents and explores the reasons why they have ignored the
country as a threat or a challenge to Russian national security. Next,
the paper explores the unofficial Russian debate about China, considers
the practical manifestations in Russian defense policy of its
Euro-centric preoccupation, and concludes with implications for the
United States.

IT IS ABOUT EUROPE

[The war in Ukraine is **but the latest conflict** in the long historic
cycle of war and peace in the relationship between Russia and the rest
of Europe]{.underline}. Virtually [the entire history of Russia as a
modern state is one of wars waged in the **European
theater**]{.underline}---against Sweden, the Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth, Prussia, Great Britain, France, Turkey, Austria, Germany,
and so on.

The history of [Russia's relationship with Asia contains **nothing
similar**]{.underline}. Compared to the major European wars, [the
conquest of Siberia was a series of **skirmishes**]{.underline}, few of
which are recognized as milestones in Russian history. Two major
military undertakings stand out---the lost Russo-Japanese war of
1904--1905 and the August 1945 campaign against Japan in Manchuria,
which is extolled in Russian historiography as the final chapter of the
Second World War. The latter lasted just a few weeks and is generally
considered a footnote to the main war effort in the European theater,
where the victory is celebrated on May 9 as the end of the Great
Patriotic War.

Since the emergence of post-Soviet Russia in 1991, [the Kremlin's
preoccupation with the insecurity of the country's **western
flank**]{.underline} has manifested itself on multiple occasions, and in
defiance of indisputable trends in European security since the end of
the Cold War. In the 1990s, [Russian leaders objected to
**NATO**]{.underline} admitting new members from Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union. Russia's president at the time, Boris Yeltsin,
accused U.S. president Bill Clinton of trying to split the continent
again.1 Russia's military threatened prospective members of the alliance
with nuclear weapons, its foreign intelligence service warned about
military retaliation in general, and its [diplomats charged that the
"**NATO-centrism**" and "**NATO-mania**" of U.S. policy "**cannot suit
Russia**."]{.underline}2 [All of these]{.underline} accusations [became
the **major, persistent theme** in Russian policy toward Europe,
culminating in the demands to fundamentally **revise European security
arrangements** presented to the United States and NATO]{.underline} in
December 2021 [as the prelude to the war against Ukraine]{.underline}.3

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Russia's objections to NATO's
eastward expansion made little sense to an outside observer as the
country's struggles and biggest challenges were domestic during that
period---the bloody campaign to suppress the separatist guerilla
movement in Chechnya, the instability in the wider North Caucasus
region, the sputtering efforts to revive the economy, and the political
chaos. The United States and its NATO allies had nothing to do with any
of these, and they provided financial and technical assistance to the
Russian government on a wide range of economic and societal reforms.

Moreover, in the aftermath of the Soviet Union's breakup, the United
States and its allies spent vast amounts of money on programs that were
essential to Russian national security. They financed and in many other
ways facilitated the removal to Russia and securing of the vast nuclear
arsenal and other weapons of mass destruction scattered across several
former Soviet republics. Although this Cooperative Threat Reduction
program was one of the key U.S. national security priorities, its
immediate beneficiary was Russia.4

As NATO's eastward expansion got underway, the United States, eager to
collect the post--Cold War "peace dividend," drastically reduced its
military presence in Europe.5 At the end of the Cold War, it had some
300,000 troops in the continent. By 1995, that number had decreased to
just over 100,000, where it remained approximately for the next decade.
By 2008, it dropped to about 65,000, where it has been ever since. By
2013---the last year before the annexation of Crimea by Russia---the
United States had reduced the number of its tanks deployed in the
European theater from 5,000 in 1989 to zero.6 Other NATO members had
carried out equally drastic changes to reduce their defense spending and
the size of their militaries.7

Thus, NATO's expansion was accompanied by a process of its
demilitarization. In speeches by its leaders and in official statements,
the alliance embraced as its purpose securing "a lasting peace in
Europe, based on common values of individual liberty, democracy, human
rights and the rule of law."8 That purpose at times seemed to overshadow
its original mission of common defense, which was expected---or almost
presumed---to become obsolete as common values would become the
foundation of European security. In two strategic concepts---in 1999 and
2010---NATO also declared achieving "partnership" with Russia as a
goal.9 In some documents it already referred to its relationship with
Russia as a "partnership."10

Senior U.S. [officials]{.underline} in speeches and testimonies
throughout the pivotal 1990s [stated that expansion would **not involve
greater deployments**]{.underline} of U.S. troops to the territories of
new members but would instead result in an overall reduction of the U.S.
military presence on the continent, which would be transformed into an
"area where wars simply do not happen."11 The alliance also pledged to
Russia that it had

> no intention, no plan and no reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the
> territory of new members, nor any need to change any aspect of NATO's
> nuclear posture or nuclear policy -- and do not foresee any future
> need to do so.12

And, given their small size and military capabilities, none of the new
members could pose individually or collectively a meaningful threat to
Russia.

In addition to its three pillars of propagation of shared democratic
values, reduction of NATO's military forces, and eastward expansion, the
revamped European security architecture was buttressed by two key
treaties intended to enhance the stability and security of all European
nations. The first was the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF)
Treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1987, which
eliminated an entire class of weapons that Soviet leaders had found
threatening to their heartland and destabilizing for international
security.13 The other was the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE)
Treaty in 1990, which imposed limits on and regulated military
deployments by all its signatories.14 In addition, Vienna Document 99
provided for increased transparency of military activities to build
mutual confidence and reduce the risk of inadvertent and accidental
escalation.

In addition to these treaties and documents governing primarily European
security matters, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
Russia signed several **arms-control treaties**]{.underline} [that
greatly reduced the numbers of strategic **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline} and means of their delivery in their arsenals.
The 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ([START
I]{.underline})[,]{.underline} the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions
Treaty ([SORT]{.underline}), [and New START]{.underline} in 2010 were
major contributions to both countries' security.

When measured by such indicators as the presence of powerful hostile
neighbors, the military footprint as well as the declarations and
actions of its presumed principal adversary in the European theater, and
the framework of legally binding treaties, Russia entered the
twenty-first century with the security of its western flank assured as
never before. That, however, was not enough for it.

IT IS OFFICIAL

These positive changes in European security were noted in a succession
of Russian national security documents of the 1990s and the 2000s.
However, these [documents also expressed a clear **unease**
about]{.underline} the eastward expansion of [NATO.]{.underline}
Beginning with the 1993 military doctrine, "the expansion of military
blocs and alliances to the detriment of the interests of the Russian
Federation's military security" was noted as a "danger" that could
become an actual threat in the event of "the introduction of foreign
troops in the territory of neighboring states of the Russian
Federation."15 [The expansion of NATO became a key theme in subsequent
iterations of **military doctrine** and **national security
strategy**]{.underline}, with growing apprehension [that "military
dangers to the Russian Federation]{.underline} \[[were]{.underline}\]
[**intensifying**," chief among them the "**military infrastructure of
NATO member countries**]{.underline}" approaching Russia's borders.16

[The most notable]{.underline} official pronouncement in this regard
[was Putin's speech at the]{.underline} 2007 [Munich Security Conference
in which he issued a stern warning to the United States and its allies
not to expand NATO further eastward]{.underline}.17 [The Kremlin
**followed up on Putin's warning**]{.underline} by crushing the Georgian
military in the brief 2008 war to make clear that it would not tolerate
Tbilisi's ambitions to join NATO.

[The war was followed by the **resumption of cooperative
relations**]{.underline} with the West.18 But [the détente]{.underline}
with the West during Dmitry Medvedev's presidency [did **not diminish
Russian opposition to NATO's eastward expansion** as a threat to its
security interests]{.underline}.19

[Russia's balancing act between **cooperation** and competition with
NATO ended following]{.underline} its 2014 annexation of [Crimea and the
start of its undeclared war in eastern Ukraine. NATO was **officially**
and **unequivocally declared** the principal source of military
danger]{.underline} to the country.20 Russia's most recent National
Security Strategy, published in July 2021, describes the United States
and NATO as developing options for nuclear and conventional strikes
against the country.21

[The war against Ukraine]{.underline}, launched by the Kremlin in
response to the West's refusal to accept its demands to fundamentally
revise the post--Cold War security arrangements, [has put an end to the
few remaining hopes of managing the tense relationship
through]{.underline} such channels as [the NATO--Russia
Council]{.underline}, the Normandy Format to resolve the stalemate in
eastern Ukraine, and the U.S.-Russia Strategic Stability Dialogue.22 The
post--Cold War chapter in relations has ended with a major war between
Russia and Ukraine backed by NATO in effect with all measures just short
of direct participation by alliance troops. [The ongoing conflict
underscores the primacy of the European theater for Russia and the
**role of the United States and NATO as the pacing
challenge**]{.underline} for its defense and national security policy.

CHINA MISSING

[By contrast, China is **virtually absent**]{.underline} from the
Russian official statements, national security documents, and narratives
spanning the three post--Cold War decades. The most recent National
Security Strategy contains two references to the country: one in the
context of "developing a relationship of all-encompassing partnership
and strategic cooperation," and the other in the context of deepening
cooperation with it in the context of the BRICS
(Brazil-India-China-South Africa) counterpart to the U.S.-led G7 group
of advanced democracies.23 Earlier iterations similarly referred to
China as a partner with whom Russia planned to sustain and expand
cooperative relations.24

[**Partnership with China** has been the **counterweight to Russia's
increasingly adversarial relations with the United States and NATO**.
The two have progressed in synch over]{.underline} the course of
[Putin's leadership, and the war against Ukraine is the **most recent
manifestation** of this dynamic]{.underline}. Just before the war,
[Putin and]{.underline} Chinese President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping
[jointly announced the "no limits" friendship and declared that there
were "no 'forbidden' areas for cooperat]{.underline}ion" between their
two countries. [These statements confirmed that **balancing against the
West** by aligning **ever closer with China**]{.underline} [is at the
**heart of Russian policy**]{.underline}.25

[From Russia's perspective, the partnership with China rests on solid
reasoning]{.underline}. This includes political complementarity between
two authoritarian governments and economic complementarity between
China's manufacturing sector and Russia's resource wealth. For Russia's
ruling elite, the relationship is particularly important for two
reasons. First, unlike the United States and the European Union, [China
does **not seek to impose its values** or **demand domestic political
changes** that would loosen its hold on power in exchange for
partnership]{.underline}. Beijing would also probably look unfavorably
at attempts by Moscow to liberalize domestic politics. Second, Russia's
ruling elite derives significant material benefits from controlling the
commanding heights of the economy. It has little incentive to change the
resource sector's dominant role in the economy, which benefits from
trade with China.

Beyond these ideological, political, and economic factors, Russia [has
sound **strategic reasons**]{.underline} for pursuing and strengthening
its partnership with China. Their priorities complement rather than
contradict each other. Since [Russia's primary theater is
**Europe**]{.underline} and [China's is the **Asia-Pacific**, their
strategic interests overlap only in Central Asia, a region that is of
**secondary importance**]{.underline} for both and where they can
deconflict their interests as long as no strategic competitor like the
United States is present.

[Russia and China share a **common adversary in the United States**,
which has **global capabilities** and presence that they see as
**challenging their interests in their critical theaters**. Both
consider U.S. defense programs, such as **missile defenses deployed in
Europe**]{.underline} and the Asia-Pacific or to protect the homeland,
[as a threat to their security and an attempt by the United States to
deny them the ability to deter and retaliate against it in the event of
war. Russia and China also in effect function as a **force
multiplier**]{.underline} [for each other by **tying up U.S.
capabilities in their respective critical theaters** and thus
**preventing it from focusing its efforts on one or the
other.**]{.underline}

AVOIDING A TWO-THEATER CONFRONTATION

[For Russia, which during most of the Cold War faced a major
confrontation in two]{.underline} strategic
[theaters]{.underline}---with the United States and NATO in Europe and
with China in Asia---[the repeat of that experience]{.underline}, which
ultimately led to the collapse of the Soviet economy and the breakup of
the Soviet Union, [is **not an option**. The Kremlin sees the West as
**by far the most serious threat**, which must be
**prioritized**]{.underline} while [disagreements with China have to be
**managed**]{.underline} and **[resolved through
diplomacy]{.underline}**.

A great deal has been written about the successful diplomatic maneuver
that was the opening of U.S. relations with China during former
president Richard Nixon's administration. For the Soviet Union, already
facing a hostile China in its Far East since the early 1960s as a result
of the Sino-Soviet split, the prospect of an alignment between
Washington and Beijing translated into a major military and economic
burden. At the height of the Cold War, it had to maintain as many as
fifty divisions facing China along a border of 4,200 kilometers.26 That
was in addition to the sixty-five divisions in the western Soviet Union,
twenty on its southern flank, and thirty in Eastern Europe.27 If the
West's victory in the Cold War is attributed to the inability of the
Soviet economy to sustain the burden of competition with the United
States and its allies, significant credit is owed to China as a force
multiplier in that competition.

[The imperative to avoid a two-theater confrontation with powerful
adversaries is]{.underline} also [a lesson of the Soviet experience
during the Second World War]{.underline}. After the experience of tense
relations in the 1930s, which culminated in a major battle in 1939 in
Mongolia, the Soviet Union signed a neutrality pact with Japan in
1941.28 Combined with intelligence that Japan would not launch an attack
against its Far East, this secured the Soviet Union's strategic rear.29
No longer threatened with a two-front war in Europe and in Asia, Moscow
was able to concentrate its effort on the war with Germany. This is a
lesson well remembered in Russia today.30

The only major military campaign carried out by the Soviet army in the
Pacific took place after the defeat of Germany. Launched against Japan
in August 1945, when the outcome of the war in the Pacific was not in
doubt, this lasted just a few weeks and was concluded in early
September. Known as the Manchurian campaign, it resulted in the defeat
of the Japanese Kwantung Army.31

In Soviet and [Russian military literature]{.underline}, which [relies
heavily on **historical experience**]{.underline} to inform future
concepts of operations[, the Manchurian campaign has long been held up
as a **successful example** of **rapid offensive
operations**]{.underline} designed to bring about a quick defeat of the
enemy as early as in the initial phase of the war.32 In preparation for
it, in early 1945, [the Soviet High Command undertook **major troop
redeployments**]{.underline} to the Far East from Europe, where the
outcome of the war with Germany was already certain. In April 1945, the
Soviet Union renounced its nonaggression treaty with Japan.33 It issued
a declaration of war on August 8 and the following day launched its
offensive---three days after the United States dropped the first atomic
bomb on Hiroshima. The operation was concluded on September 2, when
Japan surrendered. During the Cold War and the long period of tension
with China, the Manchurian campaign was seen as the prototype for
potential future operations against it.34

However, more recent Russian historiography reflects a different
understanding of the Manchurian campaign. Instead of offering lessons
for the conduct of hypothetical future operations against China, it is
used to correct what Russia sees as the false historical narrative
propagated in the West that the campaign was of marginal impact on the
defeat of Japan in the Second World War. On the occasion of the
seventieth anniversary of the campaign in 2015, the dean of Russian
military scientists, Army General Mahmut Gareev, who as a young officer
fought in the Second World War and participated in the campaign,
published an article challenging the proposition that the U.S. atomic
bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki had played the decisive role in
the defeat of Japan, arguing instead that the Manchurian campaign was of
the "greatest military-political significance."35 The campaign, he
stated, had precipitated the capitulation of Japan.

Instead of the anti-China bias evident in Russian Cold War writings,
more recent ones reflect a clear anti-Japan bias and emphasize the
Japanese threat to the Soviet Union and China during the Second World
War. Also on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the
Manchurian campaign, the official Russian government newspaper
Rossiyskaya Gazeta charged that "Japanese aggression had for many years
posed a serious threat to the vital interests of the Soviet and Chinese
peoples, \[and\] millions of Chinese were enslaved by treacherous
occupiers."36 Gareev wrote in his article that the defeat of the
Japanese army in Manchuria "washed away the shame of \[Russia's\]
defeat" in the Russo-Japanese war of 1905, which had weighed as "a heavy
memory in the conscience of our country."

The shift in Russian official historiography from the Cold War
preoccupation with China to the post--Cold War focus on Japan is
consistent with changes in security policy. Russia's ever-closer
partnership with China has relegated the prospect of a military
confrontation between them to the margins, whereas the deteriorating
relationship with the United States has elevated the perception of
threat from its treaty ally Japan.

Japan is also the only country---other than Ukraine, after the illegal
annexation of Crimea by Russia---that maintains active territorial
claims against Russia. The Russian military doctrine published in 2003
highlights the threat of maritime landing operations in the Far East.37
The potential culprit in such contingencies could only be Japan,
possibly in coalition with the United States. The document also notes
that inadequate transport links between central Russia and the Far East
could have a "negative impact" on the course of military operations.38
The combination of Japanese territorial claims and inferior Russian
capabilities in this theater could in the event of a conflict leave
Russia with few alternatives to resorting to nuclear strikes against the
invaders.

Japan hosts U.S. troops on its territory and participates in joint
military activities with the United States in the Asia-Pacific. Although
it has canceled two previously planned sites for the U.S. Aegis Ashore
missile system, it has decided to procure two Aegis-equipped ships and
thus to contribute to what Russian officials perceive as the U.S.-led
effort to build global missile defenses, which they consider to be a
threat to Russia.39 Russian analysts have also criticized Japan's
changes in its defense posture that entail, in their view, growing
geographic ambitions, capabilities beyond self-defense, and
participation in presumably U.S.-led coalition wars.40

Overall, however, [the Far East and the Asia-Pacific do **not hold a
special place as an independent theater of operations in Russian
official military thinking**]{.underline}. Rather, [its importance
reflects threat perceptions driven by adversarial relations with the
United States and its NATO allies centered on Europe and the imperative
of avoiding a **simultaneous confrontation in two far-flung
theaters**]{.underline}.

#### It's impossible to defend against [both]{.underline}. China's the [larger threat]{.underline}, but Russia will [punish the US]{.underline} if the relationship doesn't stabilize.

ASIA FIRST

[Biden's **initial theory**]{.underline} of foreign policy [was
**straightforward**: don't let **smaller challenges** distract from the
**big one**]{.underline}. Of all the threats Washington faces, Biden's
interim national security strategy argued, [China "is the **only
competitor**" able to "mount a sustained challenge]{.underline} to a
stable and open international system." [That challenge has become
**greater**]{.underline} as [China has accelerated its efforts to
**overturn the balance of power in Asia**]{.underline}. When Biden took
office, U.S. military leaders publicly warned that [Beijing could
**invade Taiwan** by 2027]{.underline}. Biden was not naive enough to
think that other problems would simply vanish. With trouble brewing on
this central front, however, he did seek a measure of calm on others.

Biden avoided another doomed "reset" with Russia, but held an early
summit with Putin in a bid to establish a "stable and predictable"
relationship. He also sought to find a path back to the 2015 nuclear
deal with Iran, thereby reducing the growing risk of confrontation in
the Middle East. Finally, Biden ended the U.S. war in Afghanistan, a
decision he justified by arguing that it was time to refocus attention
and resources on the Indo-Pacific. Relations with U.S. allies followed
the same pattern: the administration dropped U.S. opposition to the Nord
Stream 2 gas pipeline linking Russia and western Europe, wagering that
ending a contentious dispute with Germany would make it easier to win
Berlin's cooperation vis-à-vis Beijing.

Biden's emerging defense strategy has a similar thrust. The
[Trump]{.underline} administration [made a]{.underline} major [shift in
U.S. defense planning, arguing]{.underline} that [the Pentagon must
relentlessly prepare for a conflict against a great-power
challenge]{.underline}---particularly [from
**China**]{.underline}---even though that meant accepting greater risk
in other regions. [Biden's Pentagon likewise spent 2021 focusing
on]{.underline} how to deter or defeat [Chinese aggression,
withdrawing]{.underline} scarce [assets such as **missile defense
batteries**]{.underline} from the Middle East, [and making]{.underline}
**[longer-term budgetary investments]{.underline}** meant
[to]{.underline} "[prioritize China]{.underline} and its military
modernization as our pacing challenge."

TROUBLE EVERYWHERE

[Biden is **undoubtedly right**]{.underline} that [the Chinese challenge
overshadows **all others**]{.underline}, despite unresolved debates in
Washington over exactly when that challenge will become most severe.
[His administration has made **major moves**]{.underline} in the
Sino-American competition during its first year---[expanding
**multilateral military planning**]{.underline} and exercises in the
western Pacific, focusing bodies such as NATO and the G-7 on Beijing's
belligerence, and launching the AUKUS partnership with Australia and the
United Kingdom. [Yet Biden hasn't enjoyed anything resembling a respite
on **other fronts**]{.underline}.

The U.S. [withdrawal from Afghanistan]{.underline} precipitated the
collapse of the government there, [generating a near-term
crisis]{.underline} that consumed Washington's attention and [leaving
longer-term legacies]{.underline}---strategic and humanitarian---that
are likely to do the same. Meanwhile, a brutal internal conflict in
Ethiopia destabilized [one of Africa's most important
countries]{.underline}. Most problematic of all, U.S. relations with
[**Iran** and **Russia** became **worse**]{.underline}, not better.

[The United States is an **overstretched hegemon**, with a defense
**strategy out of balance** with the foreign policy it
supports]{.underline}.

**[Iran]{.underline}** [has taken a **hard-line stance**]{.underline} in
negotiations [on a **revived nuclear deal**]{.underline} while steadily
[decreasing the amount of time it would need to produce a **potential
weapon**.]{.underline} Tehran's [proxies]{.underline} have also
conducted periodic [attacks against U.S. personnel and partners in the
Middle East]{.underline} as part of an ongoing effort to force an
American withdrawal from the region.

[Putin]{.underline}, for his part, [has authorized]{.underline} or at
least permitted significant **[cyberattacks]{.underline}** [against
critical infrastructure in the United States.]{.underline} He threatened
[war against **Ukraine**]{.underline} in the spring and has now
mobilized forces [for]{.underline} what U.S. officials fear could be a
**[major invasion]{.underline}** and prolonged occupation of that
country. To preserve the peace, Moscow has demanded an acknowledged
Russian sphere of influence and the rollback of NATO's military presence
in eastern Europe. What exactly Putin has in mind for Ukraine is
uncertain, but ["**stable and predictable**" is]{.underline} clearly
[not how he envisions his relationship]{.underline} with the United
States.

These are ominous signs for 2022. The [United States could find itself
facing **grave security crises**]{.underline} in Europe and the Middle
East **[in addition to]{.underline}** persistent and [elevated tensions
in the Pacific]{.underline}. And [these possibilities hint at a deeper
problem]{.underline} in U.S. statecraft, one that has been accumulating
for years[: **strategic overstretch**]{.underline}.

MORE WITH LESS

Facing trouble on many fronts is business as usual for a global power.
U.S. foreign policy---and the defense strategy that buttresses it---has
long been designed with that problem in mind. After the Cold War, the
United States adopted a "two major regional contingencies" approach to
defense planning. In essence, it committed to maintaining a military
large and capable enough to fight two serious wars in separate regions
at roughly the same time. U.S. planners were under no illusion that
Washington could fully indemnify itself against all the threats it faced
if they happened to manifest simultaneously. Their aim was to limit the
risk inherent in a global foreign policy by ensuring that an enemy in
one theater could not wage a successful war of aggression while the
Pentagon was busy with a crisis in another. Just as the United Kingdom,
the superpower of its day, had a two-power naval standard in the
nineteenth century, a unipolar United States had a two-war standard for
a generation after 1991.

Over time, however, [the two-war standard became **impossible to
sustain**.]{.underline} The [defense spending cuts]{.underline}
associated with the Budget Control Act of 2011 (later compounded by the
sequestration cuts of 2013) [forced the Pentagon to adopt a]{.underline}
somewhat stingier **["one-plus" war standard]{.underline}** aimed at
defeating one capable aggressor and stalemating or "imposing
unacceptable costs" on another. Meanwhile, the [number of threats was
**increasing**]{.underline}. During the post-Cold War era, the Pentagon
worried mostly about potential conflicts in the Persian Gulf and the
Korean Peninsula. But the events of 2014 and 2015---the
[I]{.underline}slamic [S]{.underline}tate's rampage through Iraq and
Syria, [Russian aggression in Ukraine, and China's drive for dominance
in the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, [along
with]{.underline} ongoing operations in
[Afghanistan]{.underline}---[showed that U.S. allies and interests were
now **imperiled** in **several regions at once**.]{.underline}

[Leaders in **Moscow** and **Tehran** see]{.underline} that [the United
States is **stretched thin** and **eager to pay more attention to
China**]{.underline}.

[Washington's enemies were also **growing more formidable**. The two-war
standard was]{.underline} primarily [focused on **rogue
states**]{.underline} with second-class militaries. [Now, the United
States had to contend with two near-peer competitors, China and Russia,
that boasted **world-class conventional capabilities** alongside the
advantages that would come from fighting on their own **geopolitical
doorsteps**.]{.underline} By the end of Barack Obama's presidency, it
was an open question whether the United States could defeat China if
Beijing assaulted Taiwan, or Russia if Moscow invaded the Baltic region.
What was clear was that [any]{.underline} such [war would require the
**overwhelming majority of the Pentagon's combat power**]{.underline},
along with virtually all of its airlift and sealift capabilities.

This realization prompted a major change in U.S. defense planning. The
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration's defense strategy [declared that
the two-war standard was **history**]{.underline}. The U.S. military
would henceforth be sized and shaped to win one major war against a
great-power competitor. The United States would still be capable of
"deterring" aggression in other theaters, but, as a bipartisan
commission that included several current Biden administration officials
pointed out, how exactly the Pentagon would do so without the capability
to defeat such aggression remained ambiguous.

[Shifting]{.underline} to a one-war standard was a sensible way to
motivate the lethargic Pentagon bureaucracy to find creative solutions
to the urgent, daunting challenge of war with a near-peer rival. It
[involved a **sober recognition**]{.underline} [that losing a
great-power war could inflict a **death blow** on the **U.S.-led
international order**]{.underline}. Yet the 2018 defense strategy was
also an acknowledgment of overstretch: the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [could focus on its primary challenge **only by
reducing its ability to focus on others**]{.underline}. This limitation
is the root of the problem Biden has inherited, and it has some
dangerous implications.

THE CREDIBILITY GAP

[The **most glaring danger**]{.underline}, highlighted by the concurrent
crises in eastern Europe and East Asia, [is that the United States could
have to fight wars against **China and Russia simultaneously**. This
would indeed be a **nightmare scenario**]{.underline} for a one-war
military. But [it wouldn't take a **global security meltdown** to reveal
the problems caused by Washington's predicament]{.underline}.

First, [overstretch limits]{.underline} U.S. [options in a crisis. Where
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should draw the line
against Russian aggression in eastern Europe]{.underline}, how hard it
should push back [against Tehran's provocations in the Middle East, and
whether it should use force to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear
threshold state]{.underline} are matters that reasonable people can
debate. **[But]{.underline}** the fact that [the United States
increasingly has a **China centric defense strategy** has a
**constraining effect in other theaters**. If a U.S. president
knows]{.underline} that [the Pentagon will need everything it has for an
**all-too-plausible war with China**, he or she will be **less inclined
to use force against Iran or Russia**]{.underline}, lest Washington be
caught short if violence erupts in the Pacific.

This issue leads to a second problem: the loss of diplomatic influence
in situations short of war. [Since]{.underline} the [**Taiwan** and
**Ukraine** crises]{.underline} of early 2021, some
[observers]{.underline} have [speculated that **Putin** and]{.underline}
Chinese President **[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping [are
coordinating]{.underline} their [**coercion** as a way of threatening
Washington with a **two-front war**]{.underline}. The reality is that
[explicit coordination is **hardly necessary** to profit from U.S.
overextension]{.underline}.

Historically, [overstretched superpowers have eventually faced hard
choices]{.underline}.

Leaders in Moscow and Tehran can see that the United States is stretched
thin militarily and eager to pay more attention to China. This gives
them an incentive to push Washington harder in hopes of achieving gains
at the expense of a distracted superpower. As the Russia expert Michael
Kofman has written, Putin's strategy of using military coercion to
revise the post-Cold War order in Europe is premised on his belief that
the "greater threat from China" will eventually "force Washington to
compromise and renegotiate." The more intense its focus on China, the
higher the price the United States may be willing to pay for restraint
in other places.

[The perils of overstretch]{.underline}, however, [are not confined to
**secondary theaters**. Weakness at the periphery can ultimately cause
**weakness at the center**]{.underline}. A decade ago, the United States
withdrew its forces from Iraq to economize in the Middle East and pivot
toward the Pacific. Iraq's subsequent collapse forced Washington to
reengage there, fighting a multi-year conflict that devoured resources
and attention.

Similarly, [if the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [finds
itself in a showdown with Iran or if Russia attempts to revise the
status quo]{.underline} in eastern Europe, [Washington may once again
find itself **pivoting away from the Pacific** to reinforce
**under-resourced regions**]{.underline} that still matter to U.S.
security. [America's defense strategy is **increasingly focused on the
Indo-Pacific**, but its foreign policy remains **stubbornly
global**]{.underline}. That's a recipe for trouble all around.

TOUGH CHOICES

To be clear, [military power]{.underline} is hardly the only thing that
matters in global affairs. But it [is a necessary component of an
effective foreign policy]{.underline}, if only because force remains the
ultimate arbiter of international disputes. Xi, Putin, and other U.S.
adversaries are unlikely to be swayed by Biden's "relentless diplomacy"
unless they are also awed by the military power that backs it up.

[**Historically**, overstretched superpowers have eventually faced hard
choices about **how to address mismatches**]{.underline} between
commitments and capabilities. When the United Kingdom found itself with
more rivals than it could handle in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, it began appeasing those that were less dangerous
and proximate---including the United States---to concentrate on
containing Germany. When the Korean War revealed that Washington's
containment policy outstripped its military resources, the United States
was forced to undertake a significant defense buildup to close the gap.

The [Biden]{.underline} administration [may]{.underline} try to **[skirt
this dilemma]{.underline}** by [managing tensions with Iran, Russia, and
other challengers while **encouraging allies in Europe** and partners in
the Middle East to take greater responsibility for their own
defense]{.underline}. That's an understandable instinct. In the near
term, [both the geopolitical costs of true retrenchment and the
financial costs of rearmament may seem to exceed the difficulties of
muddling along. Yet]{.underline} Biden's first year has already shown
that [overstretch **inflicts damage on the installment
plan**.]{.underline} Eventually, [the world will punish a superpower
that allows its strategic deficit to grow **too big for too
long**.]{.underline}

Central University of Punjab, 12-10-21, \"China: A nemesis that NATO

The mention of China as a potential challenger to NATO first emerged in
one of its documents in 2019, and by 2020-21, it has become its
\"systemic rival\". From a Euro-Atlantic perspective, Russia is a direct
military threat that does not shy away from a head-on clash. Its primary
focus is on its immediate strategic backyard- Eastern Europe and Central
Asia. On the other hand, [China has **violent tendencies towards its
neighbours** and politically intimidates the countries of other regions
by actively using its economic and political clout]{.underline}.
Further, [it has forged strategic **partnerships with authoritarian
countries**, attempts to change the existing security architectures by
challenging the freedom of navigation of commercial ships by buying or
financing strategic assets worldwide]{.underline}. Thus, [it has a
global strategic agenda and is **far more dangerous than Russia
for**]{.underline} the EU and **[NATO]{.underline}**.

There has been an upward trend of trade between the EU and China. During
the first nine months of 2020, the bilateral trade between the two was
Euro 425.5 billion. Simultaneously, the EU-US trade saw a downward trend
of -11.4 percent for imports and -10 percent for exports. With regard to
the Chinese BRI, in 2018, China marked its strategic presence in
North-Western Europe with the takeover of Zeebrugge terminal in Belgium
and Greece\'s Piraeus seaport,followed by crucial infrastructural
development projects in Spain, Italy and Greece. Germany\'s Duisburg
inland port should not be missed either. The EU and NATO essentially see
the 17+1 format as a leapfrog approach by Beijing that threatens the
region\'s security.

In 2019, two significant developments took place. First, at the EU-China
summit in April 2019, a few states opposed a standard EU stand against
China, given its strategic influence. Second, Italy was the first G7
country to join the BRI. Thus, the cracks in the solidarity of the EU
began to appear. In the investments sector, the regulatory preferences
for the 5G rollout have been chiefly guided by the US. The EU security
concerns have vetted the domestic legal guidelines of individual states,
and hence, all efforts have been made to sideline Huawei, which is
primarily seen as a \"Trojan Horse\". As China aims to become a world
leader in Artificial Intelligence by 2030, the penetration of Huawei and
other such critical technologies such as biotechnology and robotics, the
propaganda warfare through disinformation campaigns challenges both
Europe and the US. The additional challenge \'democratic backsliding\'
due to the Chinese influence over the fragile partners of the EU and the
\'potential members\' can also not be missed. In light of this, the 2021
summit communiqué acknowledged the evolving nature of warfare involving
the malicious use of AI apart from simultaneous attacks with hypersonic
missiles. The threat has thus become three-fold \-- a fully modernised
conventional attack with the potential of a supplemented nuclear attack
apart from the emerging contours of hybrid warfare and the questions of
the continuance of supply chains. In a nutshell, the Chinese policies of
geostrategic and geo-economic penetration apart from its Military-Civil
Fusion (MCF) strategy constitute the core of its \"systemic challenge\".

During the Cold War, it was asserted that the security of Western Europe
depended upon the containment of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, with
the \'unipolar moment\' gradually coming to an end with the US
overstretch with wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the incorporation of
Russia in the Atlantic partnership would probably have allowed NATO to
geographically and politically cross the barriers of Eurasia.
Consequently, today from \"spoiler states\", Russia and China have
rapidly transformed themselves into \"revisionist states\", and the role
of China is a much profound one. With Joint exercises of both the
countries in the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea and Beijing\'s recent
outreach to Equatorial Guinea to establish its first permanent military
mission in the Atlantic, the Euro Atlantic insecurities will increase
all the more.

[Had the Sino-Russo strategic convergences been **nipped**]{.underline}
in the bud itself [by strategic re-evaluation]{.underline} and the
inclusion [of **Russia in NATO**]{.underline}, the story of
[geopolitics]{.underline} perhaps [could have been **fundamentally
different**]{.underline}, both for the EU and as for South Asia.
[Acceptance of Russia as an \"equal\" would have probably done away with
the heartburns that Moscow]{.underline} has right now. [The inability to
accept that **hybrid warfare**]{.underline} (4th and 5th generation)
[would necessitate **politically expanding the horizons of deterrence**
against]{.underline} a new rising power ([China]{.underline}) [has done
**more harm than good** to NATO]{.underline}. The visionary approach of
[including Russia in NATO was discouraged when Russia\'s
request]{.underline} to join the organisation [was **turned down by the
U.S.**]{.underline} not once but thrice, [leading to the creation of
**new political faultlines**. It also led to strengthening the
**Sino-Russo alliance** apart from leaving a **geopolitical vacuum** in
which China and Russia could attempt to downplay the EU and
NATO]{.underline}. Today, the takeover or annexation of the Crimea, the
[Ukrainian crisis, the refugee dispute between Poland and Belarus, and
the inclusion of the EU]{.underline} countries [in]{.underline} the
[BRI]{.underline} Corridor [have become the **larger geopolitical
testers**]{.underline} of a \'United\' EU and NATO, apart from the US
sphere of influence.

[There is still a lack of political cohesion on]{.underline} the
[methodologies to tackle China]{.underline} in this direction. While the
US and Britain have decided to boycott Beijing 2022 Olympic and
Paralympic Winter Games, [the EU]{.underline}, on the other hand, [has
refrained from taking a collective stand]{.underline} on the issue.
Given the increasingly intertwined stakes that the Union has with China,
it is hesitant to take a joint stand fearing its retaliatory \"economic
coercion\". France\'s position is contrary to the US, which is well
grasped in the backdrop of the formation of the AUKUS and the severed
deal between Canberra and Paris. Such emerging diverging approaches
within the EU that China would possibly try to use in its favour to
increase its strategic foothold, thereby weakening the Atlantic
alliance.

Early this year, G7 partners announced the \'Build Back Better World
Initiative\' (B3W), followed by the \'Global Gateway\' initiative that
aims to mobilise Euro 300 billion between 2021 and 2027. As one can see,
the developments are similar to the \'Greek-Turkish Aid Bill\' --- the
US initial response to contain Communist expansion. However, in the
contemporary scenario, [additions such as hybrid warfare, hostile
economic takeovers, and dual-use ports have ushered in **new dimensions
of geopolitics**]{.underline}. A full-blown \'New Cold War\' is in
place.

[China and Russia would]{.underline} probably [seek to **militarily
distract** the EU and the US with]{.underline} small but
[essentia]{.underline}l **[\'hotspots\']{.underline}** [such as
**Taiwan** and **Ukraine**. The risks of **escalation** and
**misjudgement** have increased the chances of **open
hostilities**]{.underline} all the more, [but, given the constraints of
**economic dependencies**]{.underline}, especially the questions of the
continuance of supply chain routes, [one can be **still doubtful of the
NATO response**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [territorial **nibbling**
would also **not be taken lightly**]{.underline} by NATO. [The vicious
circle thus seems to continue with more of **trade wars**,
**sanctions**, and **hostile takeovers**]{.underline}, thereby [creating
sharp polarisations **throughout the globe**]{.underline} [and regional
and other organisations such as]{.underline} the EU and
[NATO]{.underline}.

POST--COLD WAR U.S.-RUSSIAN RELATIONS---WHAT WENT WRONG?

U.S. policy toward Russia since the end of the Cold War is a story of
different administrations pursuing essentially the same set of policies.
[Two aspects stand out as **major irritants**]{.underline} in the
bilateral relationship[: a refusal to accept Russia **as it
is,**]{.underline} as evidenced by repeated initiatives to reform and
remake its political system[; and the **extension of the Euro-Atlantic
security architecture** into the Eurasian space surrounding Russia. Both
of these highly ambitious pursuits have been attempted **repeatedly and
unsuccessfully**, yet both continue to be **cornerstones of official
U.S. policy toward Russia**]{.underline}. In retrospect, it is hard to
escape the conclusion that [a less ambitious U.S. approach to dealing
with Russia]{.underline} and the states of the former Soviet Union
[could have established a **better basis** for a less rocky U.S.-Russian
relationship.]{.underline}

BOOM TO BUST

Addressing a joint session of Congress in January 1991, then president
George H. W. Bush spoke about his desire "to continue to build a lasting
basis" for cooperation with Russia.6 His wish, no doubt sincere, was
expressed at a time of widely held hopes that the Cold War was ending
and the two superpowers would put their differences aside and begin
collaborating on the world's many problems "for a more peaceful future
for all mankind."7

It was indeed a promising phase in relations between Washington and
Moscow, full of significant accomplishments and optimism about the
future. In a short period of time, the two Cold War adversaries
negotiated a treaty to reduce strategic nuclear weapons (START II),
signed a multilateral treaty on conventional forces in Europe,
negotiated the terms for German reunification and a unified Germany's
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and agreed
on a charter for European security and stability after the Cold War.
Moreover, their cooperation was not confined to Europe; they also
jointly sponsored a major conference in Madrid on the Middle East and
successfully dealt with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's aggression against
Kuwait. Most important, they entered into all of these endeavors with a
new spirit of U.S.-Russian partnership, a far cry from the threatening
rhetoric and tensions that had been a hallmark of their relationship for
more than a generation.

For the three decades that followed, the U.S.-Russian relationship went
through a series of boom-bust cycles, reaching its nadir after the
Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and interference in the 2016 U.S.
presidential election. Through the Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and
Barack Obama administrations, U.S. policy toward Russia followed a
familiar pattern. First, a new presidential administration comes into
the White House deeply dissatisfied with the state of the U.S.-Russia
relationship. It commits to do better and launches a policy review that
generates a new approach---a "reset"---toward Russia aimed at developing
a partnership. The road toward partnership looks promising, but
obstacles gradually begin to emerge and eventually escalate into a
full-blown crisis. By the end of the administration's time in office,
the relationship is at the lowest point since the Cold War.

Thus, the spirit of partnership that marked the end of the Cold War did
not last long. The elder Bush's hope for a new relationship with Russia
in a new world order ran into the harsh reality of the rapid
disintegration of the Soviet Union and the chaos that engulfed Russia
less than a year after his speech. The Bush administration had little
chance to prepare for such a dramatic turn of events and develop a
policy commensurate with the magnitude of the change in Russia and
elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. Consumed by domestic economic and
political crises, Russia largely retreated from the world stage and for
the most part was rendered largely incapable of acting as a partner to
the United States as envisioned by Bush. Demoralized and embittered
Russian elites soon constructed a narrative---greatly amplified by the
Kremlin throughout Vladimir Putin's presidency---that the United States
had taken advantage of their country at a moment of weakness, which
created a sense of victimhood and soured the overall atmosphere in
U.S.-Russian relations.

The Clinton administration, frustrated with what it saw as its
predecessor's insufficiently robust engagement to support reforms in
Russia, declared its intent in 1993 to build "the foundation for a new
democratic partnership between the United States and Russia."8 Speaking
in Vancouver, Canada, in April 1993, at the first of his many summits
with Russia's then president Boris Yeltsin, Clinton promised:

> Mr. President, our nation will not stand on the sidelines when it
> comes to democracy and Russia. We know where we stand. We are with
> Russian democracy, we are with Russian reforms, we are with Russian
> markets. We support freedom of conscience and speech and religion. We
> support respect for ethnic minorities. We actively support reform and
> reformers and you in Russia.9

Soon after these hopeful words were spoken, [the relationship
encountered its first bumps]{.underline}. In late September and early
October 1993, tensions between the Russian executive and legislative
branches came to a head in a bloody confrontation in Moscow, as the
constitutional crisis between Yeltsin and his rebellious parliament led
to violence in the streets. When the dust settled, Yeltsin had managed
to push through a new constitution that consolidated executive power to
such an extent that in effect it placed the presidency above all other
branches of government. That same [autumn, Russian officials expressed
their strong **opposition to NATO enlargement**]{.underline}1[, which
was emerging as the **principal pillar of U.S. policy** in
Europe.]{.underline}0

[The new partnership between Russia and China is America\'s ***chickens
coming home to roost**.*]{.underline}

Russia and China announced the formation of a "no-limits" partnership
last week, the predictable consequence of America's misguided policy
towards post-Soviet Russia and ill-advised embrace of a rising China.

Putin and Xi publicized the agreement, spanning over 5,000 words in
English, just before the two leaders were seen at the opening ceremonies
of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, which is under diplomatic boycott by
the U.S. and other Western nations over the CCP's human-rights abuses.
"Friendship between the two States has no limits, there are no
'forbidden' areas of cooperation," the signatory nations said in a joint
statement.

In [the new bilateral pact]{.underline}, the nations [pledged mutual
support on issues that are sure to **enflame the U.S. and its
allies**]{.underline}. [Russia]{.underline} proclaimed [its support of
the **One-China principle**]{.underline}---the idea that Taiwan is an
inseparable part of China---[and]{.underline} expressed [opposition to
Taiwanese independence]{.underline}. For its part, [China joined
Russia's call to **end NATO enlargement**]{.underline}. The pair also
reiterated their [opposition to the trilateral "AUKUS"
agreement]{.underline}, which would help provide the Australians with
nuclear-powered submarines, and "[the advancement of U.S. plans to
develop global missile]{.underline} \[[defense]{.underline}\] [and
deploy its elements in various regions of the world, combined with
capacity building of high-precision non-nuclear weapons for disarming
strikes and other strategic objectives.]{.underline}"

Further, China and Russia pledged to cooperate on the development of
artificial intelligence, information security, and space technologies.
The nations also unveiled an energy deal worth \$117.5 billion that will
bolster Russia's gas exports to East Asia.

[Evolving circumstances in **Ukraine**]{.underline} [and the
S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea [provide the
**backdrop**, and **considerable incentive**, for the new
agreement]{.underline} between China and Russia. Russia has amassed over
100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine over the past few months. The
Biden administration has responded by announcing the deployment of about
3,000 additional U.S. troops to Europe, keeping another 8,500 on
standby. Aside from the AUKUS agreement, [things have grown more
complicated in the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea [due to an **increased number of Chinese incursions
into Taiwan's air defense**]{.underline} identification zone (ADIZ) and
rumors that Washington might shed its strategic ambiguity with respect
to Taiwan. [These developments are the latest in a **long line of
miscalculations** by the U.S. foreign policy apparatus over 30
years]{.underline}.

In 1949, many core European countries were still recovering from the
Second World War. The Soviet Union was, too, but its economy had
recovered more rapidly than expected and it was developing and testing
nuclear weapons. Thus, trans-Atlanticists saw a need for a defensive
alliance to stave off whatever territorial ambitions the Soviet Union
had in Western Europe. Et voilà, NATO was born. Originally, the alliance
had 12 members. Only one, Norway, shared a border with Russia. The
Soviets responded with the creation of their own alliance, the Warsaw
Pact, in 1955. By then, NATO had already added Greece, Turkey, and West
Germany.

Thirty-six years later, increased pressure from the West and
contradictions within the Soviet system resulted in the dissolution of
the USSR in 1991. The U.S. and its [NATO]{.underline} allies
[**outlasted** the Soviets and the Warsaw Pact]{.underline}. Just like
that, [NATO's raison d'être **disappeared**]{.underline}. NATO was
forced to reckon with the consequences of victory. [More than four
decades of **bureaucratic entrenchment** and **military-industrial**
expansion made the thought of ending NATO
**unpopular**]{.underline}---not to mention the fact that the United
States, unquestionably the leader of the NATO alliance, saw the alliance
as a means to cement its global hegemony.

So, instead of going out of business, [NATO went out of area, wading
into **conflicts in the Middle East**]{.underline} and [micromanaging
European instability]{.underline}. Since the fall of the USSR, [NATO has
pursued a dual track of diplomacy with Russia---simultaneously
**cooperating with Russia**]{.underline} on its chosen campaigns to
remain relevant [and maintaining the Cold War frame that Russia is the
**main menace in Europe**.]{.underline}

From 1994-1997, it appeared NATO and Russia were making real efforts to
find areas of mutual cooperation. Russia entered into NATO's Partnership
for Peace program in 1994, and three years later, the two parties signed
the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security, stating
"the reasons why NATO and Russia believe that it is in their shared
interest to cooperate more broadly and intensively."

In 1999, however, [NATO **returned to its old ways**, accepting Hungary,
Poland, and the Czech Republic]{.underline} as members of the alliance.
[The move angered the Russians]{.underline}, as NATO expansion was still
a sore point for even post-Soviet Russia. The [Russians had already felt
betrayed]{.underline} by the fact that, in subsequent negotiations
between the USSR and president George H.W. Bush's administration,
then-U.S. Secretary of State James Baker's alleged promise to the USSR
that NATO would move "not one inch" eastward never reappeared. NATO's
expansion in 1999 confirmed Russia's fears.

Nevertheless, NATO continued to court Russian cooperation. At the 2002
NATO Summit in Rome, the alliance and Russia signed another agreement to
create the NATO-Russia Council, which produced results in issue areas
such as counterterrorism.

Yet [NATO continued to **undercut its progress with
Russia**]{.underline} in other areas [by]{.underline} its **[continued
expansion]{.underline}**. In 2004, [NATO expanded for the **fifth
time**]{.underline}, adding Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and
the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), two of which share a
border with Russia. NATO then made Albania and Croatia members in 2009,
Montenegro in 2017, and North Macedonia as recently as 2020. "Not one
inch" turned into nearly 1,000 miles pretty quickly.

[Russia believes **NATO expansion won't end there**]{.underline}. Given
the precedent NATO has set, [it's **hard to blame them**]{.underline}.
In fact, NATO and some of its key member states like [the U.S. have
**openly expressed desires** to **keep expanding up to Russia's western
border**. NATO has been courting Ukraine and Georgia, **two vital
nations** in the Russian cultural imagination]{.underline}, since 1994.

While the U.S.-led [NATO]{.underline} alliance [was pursuing its
**muddled**]{.underline}, **[incoherent]{.underline}** [approach to
Russia, Russia and China started **patching up the holes**]{.underline}
in their relationship left by the Sino-Soviet split. [The two nations
solved a decades-long border dispute, increased trade in vital
industries like machine goods, textiles, energy, and other natural
resources.]{.underline} The U.S. encouraged China's rise to global
prominence by, among other things, allowing it to enter the World Trade
Organization. As one Joe Biden said in 2011, "a rising China is a
positive, positive development, not only for China but for America and
the world writ large."

Which brings us to the present moment, in which [the **trans-Atlantic
foreign policy elites**]{.underline}, bolstered by their beneficiaries
in the military-industrial complex, [refuse to offer **any prudent
course-correction to prevent the formation**]{.underline} [of a
full-fledged **axis against the United States**]{.underline}. This could
end with America's sons and daughters dying overseas to solve the
problems they created. But it doesn't have to.

reference. But it was [the structure of the new international
system]{.underline} that [concerned them]{.underline} more. Both of
course recognized that with the passing of the old order the world had
changed for ever; and both would now have to sink or swim in a word
dominated by the market. There could be no going back to the past. On
the other hand, the world as seen from Beijing and Moscow was not one in
which either could feel especially comfortable. For one thing,
[the]{.underline} established [rules]{.underline} governing the world
[had all been written by the West.]{.underline} The metaphorical table
around which the main players then sat was also made and designed in the
West. And [sitting at the top]{.underline} of the table of course [was
the established hegemon: United States.]{.underline}

To add material insult to injury, in this world [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [not only possessed a vast amount of power - soft
and hard - but an **extensive alliance system**]{.underline} as well.
[**Its very existence** not only reminded China and Russia how few
genuine friends they had themselves; it also contributed in significant
ways to America\'s ability to place pressure on the two
countries]{.underline}. The US may have proclaimed its innocence,
insisting that the last thing it was thinking about when it enlarged
[**NATO** was to **encircle Russia**]{.underline}, or that when it
tilted to Asia it was looking to contain China rather than engage it.
However, that is not how things were viewed in either Moscow or Beijing.
Indeed, for the Chinese the so-called \'tilt\' (accompanied as it was by
what they saw as a change in US military doctrine)29 was seen as a
highly aggressive act; and the only legitimate response, it was felt,
was to fight fire with fire which it did with an \'outpouring\' of
increased \'anti-American sentiment\' in China itself followed up by
what looked to many as a final abandonment in practice, if not in
theory, of the tried and true Deng principle of keeping a low profile.
To underscore the point, [it also began to refer to the US less
frequently as **global partner**]{.underline} - though such language did
not disappear entirely from the Chinese foreign policy discourse31 - and
more as a potential rival which would for ever seek to maintain its
position of primacy in Asia through the manipulation of its still highly
dependent allies. This in turn connects to a wider debate in which China
and Russia have been engaged for some time about the structure of the
world system after the Cold War; and one thing has emerged from these:
[neither feels that their interests, singly or collectively, are best
protected in a system in which power is so heavily concentrated in the
hands of a single \'hegemon\']{.underline}, especially when that hegemon
happens to be a liberal power like the United States of America. This
not only flows from their very strongly held realist belief that
hegemony by definition confers great status on the hegemon. The
[concentration of power in the hands of a single power they argue is
also likely to encourage **greater assertiveness**]{.underline}. Clinton
may have resisted the temptation for a while, though not entirely as the
NATO-led bombing of Kosovo showed. But post 9/11 the situation changed
dramatically, and buoyed up by a American public fearful of yet another
attack, and [taking]{.underline} full [advantage of the]{.underline}
freedom afforded it by the much debated [unipolar \'moment\', the US
launched a war on terror with the ostensible goal of combatting global
jihad]{.underline} (of which the Chinese and Russians approved) but with
the unwritten purpose (to which they did not) of reasserting US power
after what many on the republican political right saw as a post-Cold War
decade of drift.34 The lesson drawn in China and Russia from all this
were obvious: until and when the distribution of power in the
international system had become more evenly distributed - in short had
become \'multipolar\' - then the world would not only remain a deeply
disturbed place but one in which their voice would remain marginal at
best, insignificant at worst. 35

## Solvency

### 1NC---NATO CAN'T SOLVE

#### NATO efforts fail to solve for the Global South AND their motives are unethical

**Burt '21 (Peter,** researcher at Drone Wars UK working on issues
relating to artificial intelligence and autonomy and their role in the
future development of drones, "NATO's new AI strategy: lacking in
substance and lacking in leadership", Published 11/8/2021, Accessed
7/17/2022,
<https://natowatch.org/sites/default/files/2021-11/briefing_88_nato_ai_strategy.pdf//EA>)

Whilst publication of the AI strategy is a step in the right direction
for NATO, although perhaps not a particularly ambitious one, a number of
questions about NATO\'s position on the use of AI remain unanswered. So
far NATO has only published a \'summary\' of its AI strategy, raising an
obvious question: what does the rest of the document say? [Does it
expand upon resolving ethical and human rights concerns in more detail
and include clear monitoring processes to do this, or does it set out a
manifesto for tackling the realities of how NATO expects to take forward
the use of AI for military purposes?]{.underline} Running through the
strategy is the mantra of interoperability -- the desire for different
systems to be able to work with each other across NATO\'s different
forces and nations without any restrictions. An article in the NATO
Review journal by two of the authors of the strategy, Zoe
Stanley-Lockman and Edward Hunter Christie, makes it clear that "[the
aim of NATO's AI Strategy is to accelerate AI adoption", and NATO
evidently intends AI to be adopted at all levels within the organisation
and across all its roles.]{.underline} Despite the good intentions
behind the ethical principles, a key thrust of the new strategy is to
enable the uptake of AI for military purposes. In the same article
Stanley-Lockman and Christie also talk of AI as an enabler [to
"out-adapt competitors and adversaries", and the strategy itself states
that collaboration and cooperation on AI among NATO allies is necessary
"in order to maintain NATO's technological edge". NATO clearly sees the
adoption of AI in terms of a zerosum arms race against rivals such as
China and Russia]{.underline}, which are also investing heavily in AI,
and presumably believes it can win the race. [This is problematic, as
arms races have the potential to escalate, as has been the case with
other weapons. Competition has no absolute end goal---merely the
relative goal of staying ahead of the other competitors. Should one
player cross an ethical line, such as developing and deploying
autonomous weapon systems, others may be expected to follow suit with
destabilising consequences. NATO\'s ethical principles for the
responsible use of AI, though welcome, raise several
issues.]{.underline} Such statements of principle are now commonplace in
the corporate sector and are increasingly being adopted by governments
on both a unilateral and multilateral basis. NATO\'s principles are
similar to principles adopted by the US Department of Defense for the
ethical use of AI: indeed, in some places the wording is the same as
that in the Department of Defense principles. As with many such
statements of principle, the NATO principles have no coherent means of
implementation or enforcement. Their successful adoption will in many
ways depend upon leadership and political and military culture, which is
different in each of NATO\'s 30 member states. Will Turkey, for example,
which has been a keen proponent of automated warfare and by some
accounts has already developed AI-based loitering munitions with an
autonomous capability to identify targets, be willing to follow the same
rules as the USA? And would the USA under a second Trump administration
follow the same rules as a Biden administration? [In the absence of any
binding enforcement mechanism NATO\'s principles may provide useful for
public relations purposes but are likely to be less useful in preventing
harm to humans, particularly those in the Global South who are already
in situations of conflict, and historically marginalised
groups.]{.underline} Despite the plethora of corporate statements on
ethical principles, those working in the tech sector are skeptical about
the prospect that ethical AI design will be adopted as a norm over the
next decade. A non-random poll conducted by the Pew Research Centre in
early 2021 found that 68% of experts in the field thought that ethical
principles focused primarily on the public good will not be employed in
most AI systems by 2030. [Their concerns recognised that the main
developers and deployers of AI are focused on profit-seeking and social
control, and that global competition will matter more to the development
of AI than any ethical issues.]{.underline} This latter factor will very
much influence NATO\'s future adoption of AI. [Although NATO\'s ethical
AI principles are stated to have been developed on the basis of "Allied
approaches and relevant work in applicable international fora", it is
not clear whether they draw on views from the wide range of professional
disciplines necessary to develop a representative and rounded view of
the ethical pitfalls and risks associated for AI, or from a diversity of
perspectives.]{.underline} There has certainly been no open consultation
on their formulation, and it is possible that the principles may only
represent the perceptions of a relatively narrow range of predominantly
white male technocrats and military planners drawn from within NATO,
member governments (notably the USA), and the arms industry. [Ordinary
people, particularly marginalised groups and those in the Global South,
will ultimately face the consequences and impacts of NATO\'s decisions
on AI systems, yet the public have certainly not been involved in making
decisions on this strategy, which will set the framework for NATO\'s
future AI choices.]{.underline} NATO\'s AI strategy does not discuss the
development of AI-driven autonomous weapon systems -- a significant
omission, given the ethical issues that this application of AI would
raise and the challenges to human rights that such weapons would pose.
As a bare minimum, the strategy could---and should---have endorsed the
\'Guiding Principles\' on emerging technologies in the area of lethal
autonomous weapons which have recently been adopted by consensus by High
Contracting Parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons
(CCW). Despite increasing pressure for a ban on the development and use
of lethal autonomous weapons, key NATO states including the USA and UK
have been lukewarm about the need for a ban, arguing that current laws
of war are adequate to regulate any such weapons. This seems optimistic,
given the rapid development of AI technology and the push by some states
over recent years to redefine the rules that govern use of armed force
to suit their own purposes. To date no NATO member states have supported
the call for a ban on lethal autonomous weapons. If NATO members were
serious about ensuring that the military use of AI adheres to
international humanitarian law and human rights law, they would call for
and engage in negotiations on a legally binding instrument on autonomous
weapons systems at the CCW; which is expected to take a historic
decision on this issue at its Review Conference in December 2021.
Investment and innovation in artificial intelligence is being led by the
private sector, and not by the world's militaries. Recognising this,
NATO\'s AI strategy places a premium on engaging with "start-ups,
innovative small and medium enterprises, and academic researchers that
either have not considered working on defence and security solutions, or
simply find the adoption pathways too slow or restrictive for their
business models". NATO wants to "make defence and security a more
attractive sector for civilian innovators to partner with". [Aiming to
capture the civilian tech sector in this way risks increasing the
influence of the military-industrialpolitical complex to an even greater
extent than is already the case.]{.underline} Will this really help
advance NATO\'s liberal and democratic values? Conclusion Although
NATO\'s AI strategy contains a few worthwhile nuggets, on balance it is
tame and unambitious. It is depressingly clear that NATO sees AI as
basically another way of using technology to wage war more effectively,
and is not willing to show any real leadership to mitigate the risks
that AI poses to human rights and dignity[.]{.underline} War is, after
all, the highest area of risk when it comes to the potential for human
rights abuses, yet NATO\'s strategy says nothing about measures to
effectively govern military AI and autonomous weapon systems. AI has the
potential to help humanity tackle intractable \'wicked problems\' such
as climate change and unsustainable development, and tackle the course
of dangerous behaviour which is threatening the survival of our species.
But this will only happen if it is employed under wise and decisive
human leadership, otherwise it may dramatically compound the problems we
face, threatening international security and human rights even more.
NATO, unfortunately, seems unwilling to provide that leadership.

### 1NC---NO NATO CONSENSUS

#### NATO will not agree on universal regulations

**Heikkila 21** (Melissa, Journalist for Politico newspaper, "NATO wants
to set AI standards.  If only its members agreed on the basics.",
Politico.eu,
https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-ai-artificial-intelligence-standards-priorities/)

The problem is that [NATO\'s members are at very different stages when
it comes to thinking about AI in the military context.]{.underline} [The
U.S., the world\'s biggest military spender, has prioritized the use of
AI in the defense realm. But in Europe, most countries --- France and
the Netherlands excepting --- barely mention the technology's defense
and military implications in their national AI strategies]{.underline}.
["It's absolutely no surprise that the U.S. had a military AI strategy
before it has a national AI strategy,\" but the Europeans \"did it
exactly the other way around,\"]{.underline} said Ulrike Franke, a
senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said:
[That echoes familiar transatlantic differences --- and previous U.S.
President Donald Trump\'s complaints --- over defense spending, but also
highlights the different approaches to AI regulation]{.underline} more
broadly. [The EU\'s AI strategy takes a cautious line, touting itself as
\"human-centric,\" focused on taming corporate excesses and keeping
citizens\' data safe. The U.S., which tends to be light on regulation
and keen on defense, sees things differently. There are also divergences
over what technologies the alliance ought to develop, including lethal
autonomous weapons systems --- often dubbed "killer robots" ---
programmed to identify and destroy targets without human control.
Powerful NATO members including France, the U.K., and the U.S. have
developed these technologies and oppose a treaty on these weapons, while
others like Belgium and Germany have]{.underline} [[expressed serious
concerns](https://www.stopkillerrobots.org/action-and-achievements/)
about the technology. These weapons systems have also faced fierce
public opposition from civil society and human rights groups, including
from United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who in
2018]{.underline}
[[called](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/speeches/2018-11-05/remarks-web-summit)
for a ban. Geoană said the alliance has "retained autonomous weapon
systems as part of the interests of NATO." The group hopes that its
upcoming recommendations will allow the ethical use of the technology
without "stifling innovation." These issues threaten to hamper NATO\'s
standard-setting drive.]{.underline} \"I think there's a certain danger
that if NATO doesn't take this on as a real challenge, that it may be
marginalized by other such efforts," Franke said. She pointed to the
U.S.-led [[AI Partnership for
Defense]{.underline}](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2020/09/france-israel-s-korea-japan-others-join-pentagons-ai-partnership/168533/),
which consists of 13 countries from Europe and Asia to collaborate on AI
use in the military context --- a forum which could supplant NATO as the
standard-setting body. That could have consequences for human rights,
too. "NATO... is a great place to responsibly think about how to harness
the good parts of this technology and how to prohibit the parts that
would be catastrophic for humanitarian law and human rights law, and
people at the end of the day," said Verity Coyle, a senior adviser at
Amnesty International, which is part of the [[Stop Killer
Robots]{.underline}](https://www.stopkillerrobots.org/) campaign.
"Without oversight mechanisms to ensure ethical standards and measures,
which would guarantee that this technology will operate under meaningful
human control" NATO's strategy could head into an "ethical vacuum,"
Coyle said. Franke said [it\'s better for the alliance to focus on the
basics, like increased data sharing to develop and train military AI and
cooperating on using artificial intelligence in logistics. "If NATO
countries were to cooperate on that, that could create good procedures
and set precedents. And I think we should then move on to the more
controversial things such as autonomous weapons systems,"]{.underline}
she said.

On 21 April 2021, the European Commission presented the Artificial
Intelligence Act. As a Fellow at Stanford University's Transatlantic
Technology Law Forum and a Member of the European AI Alliance, I made
independent strategic recommendations to the European Commission.
President Ursula von der Leyen\'s team adopted some of the suggestions
that I offered them, or has itself arrived to the same conclusions. That
is encouraging. This contribution will list the main points of this
novel regulatory framework for AI. 1 Mauritz Kop is Stanford Law School
TTLF Fellow at Stanford University and is Managing Partner at AIRecht,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 2 Core horizontal rules for AI [The EU AI
Act sets out horizontal rules for the development, commodification and
use of AI-driven products, services and systems within the territory of
the EU. The draft regulation provides core artificial intelligence rules
that apply to all industries. The EU AI Act introduces a sophisticated
'product safety framework' constructed around a set of 4 risk
categories]{.underline}. It imposes requirements for market entrance and
certification of High-Risk AI Systems through a mandatory CE-marking
procedure. [To ensure equitable outcomes, this pre-market conformity
regime also applies to machine learning training, testing and validation
datasets. The Act seeks to codify the high standards of the EU
trustworthy AI paradigm, which requires AI to be legally, ethically and
technically robust, while respecting democratic values, human rights and
the rule of law.]{.underline} Objectives of the EU Artificial
Intelligence Act The proposed regulatory framework on Artificial
Intelligence has the following objectives: 1. ensure that AI systems
placed on the Union market and used are safe and respect existing law on
fundamental rights and Union values; 2. [ensure legal certainty to
facilitate investment and innovation in AI]{.underline}; 3. [enhance
governance and effective enforcement of existing law on fundamental
rights and safety requirements applicable to AI systems]{.underline}; 4.
facilitate the development of a single market for lawful, safe and
trustworthy AI applications and prevent market fragmentation. Subject
Matter of the EU AI Act The scope of the AI Act is largely determined by
the subject matter to which the rules apply. In that regard, Article 1
states that: Article 1 Subject matter This Regulation lays down: (a)
harmonised rules for the placing on the market, the putting into service
and the use of artificial intelligence systems ('AI systems') in the
Union; (a) prohibitions of certain artificial intelligence practices;
(b) specific requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for
operators of such systems; (c) [harmonised transparency rules for AI
systems intended to interact with natural persons, emotion recognition
systems and biometric categorisation systems]{.underline}, and AI
systems used to generate or manipulate image, audio or video content;
(d) rules on market monitoring and surveillance.

[Despite the incredible boon that computational techniques have been to
society, certain red flags have recently appeared which demonstrate that
algorithms, in particular AI/ML techniques that rely on data, can be
biased.]{.underline} A [growing number of global leaders and experts
including Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Georges Church and Stephen Hawking have
publicly voiced their concern regarding the speed and pervasiveness of
the developments of AI/ML.]{.underline} In the US, President Obama's
administration produced a report which states that "big data
technologies can cause societal harms beyond damages to privacy"
\[Executive office of the President et al., 2014\]. [In particular, it
expressed concerns about the possibility that decisions informed by big
data could have discriminatory effects, even in the absence of
discriminatory intent.]{.underline} The 2017 edition of the World
Economics Forum Global Risks Report, which surveyed 745 leaders in
business, government, academia and members of the Institute of Risk
Management, listed AI as "the emerging technology with the greatest
potential for negative consequences over the coming decade". Many
negative instances have now been demonstrated \[O'Neil, 2016;
Kirkpatrick, 2016; Barocas and Selbst, 2015\]. For instance, Google's
online advertising system displayed ads for high-income jobs to men much
more often than it did to women \[Datta et al., 2015\], and ads for
arrest records were significantly more likely to show up on searches for
distinctively black names or a historically black fraternity \[Sweeney,
2013\]. [Recent events have shown that such algorithmic bias is
affecting society in a multitude of ways, e.g., exacerbating systemic
bias in the racial composition of the American prison
population]{.underline} \[Angwin et al., 2016\], inadvertently promoting
extremist ideology \[Costello et al., 2016\] and affecting the results
of elections \[Baer, 2016; Bakshy et al., 2015\]. Despite these serious
concerns, algorithms, at a fundamental level, pervade everything we do.
Simply eliminating them is not an option. Hence it is essential to
design algorithmic tools and regulatory mechanisms to empower society at
large to mitigate any resulting discrimination, inequality and bias. For
AI/ML to remain beneficial, we must build trust in the systems that are
transforming our social, political and business environments and are
making decisions on our behalf. We consider at the technical aspect of
how bias and discrimination can creep into decisions made by AI, often
despite the best intentions of the developers of the algorithm, and how
can we prevent such negative outcomes. We then outline the necessary
regulatory mechanisms and techniques that must be developed in order to
prevent such biases in the future.

2 Algorithmic Bias

One must first understand how such biases occur. Indeed, computers are
inherently impartial, and computer scientists and programmers are not
malicious. The problem lies at all points in the cycle of collecting,
encoding, modeling and optimizing the data.

2.1 Sources of Algorithmic Biases

Input Data The problem begins with the data that the algorithms build
upon, or even the realities of the world itself. Unconscious and
systemic biases, rather than intentional choices, account for a large
part of the disparate treatment observed in employment, housing, credit,
and consumer markets \[Pager and Shepherd, 2008\]. Such biases can lead
to misrepresentation of particular groups in the training data. If the
set of examples in the training data do not fairly represent the data on
which the algorithm is supposed to run then misrepresented groups could
be disadvantaged \[Barocas and Selbst, 2014\].

Data Vectorization and Cleaning

The raw data must be converted into a digital form (i.e., represented by
some kind of vector) that an algorithm can use. This process can also
introduce biases. This effect is most striking when the training data is
labeled manually; the inherent subjectivity in labeling the data can
naturally lead to a bias in the dataset. Consider the real life example
of St. Georges Hospital in the United Kingdom in where an algorithm for
admission decision was developed based on the previous decisions by the
admissions committee \[Lowry and Macpherson, 1988\]. This algorithm
simply learned existing biases in the admissions process and resulted in
being systematically unfavorable towards minorities.

Model Building

AI/ML algorithms then take as input a subset of vectorized and/or
labeled data, and output a model that can take decisions or make
predictions. In making these predictions, algorithms can not only
propagate biases as discussed above, but in fact amplify them. One
potential solution would be to strip away any identifying information
that could lead to discrimination, intended or otherwise. However, this
could unnecessarily (or undesirably) hamstring the algorithm itself,
rendering it useless.

Behavioral Impact

This in turn affects users' actions, feeding back into the real world.
For example, it has been hypothesized that increasingly polarized
content in search results and online feeds such as Facebook and Twitter
can lead to increasingly polarized opinions and behavior \[Epstein and
Robertson, 2015\]. Hence, the steps in the AI/ML life cycle become a
destructive feedback loop that can not only propagate, but also
exacerbate, societal biases. Thus, if approached without care,
algorithms can end up duplicating or even aggravate existing patterns of
discrimination that persist in society.

2.2 A Rising Level of Awareness in the EU

[On 25 May 2018, **the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will be
directly applicable in all Member States of the European Union**. It
brings some **substantial changes on data protection and decision making
based on algorithms.** The GDPR aims at creating a free data flow market
in the EU, while making the rules on data protection in the EU
consistent, reinforcing data subject's fundamental rights and increasing
the liability of companies that control and process such
data.]{.underline} Its scope is global (Art. 3, §1). In particular**[,
it reaffirms the data subject's right to explanation and places
restrictions on automated decision-making.]{.underline}** The GDPR will
be applicable in all EU countries and will introduce EU-wide maximum
penalties of e20 million or 4% of Global revenue, whichever is greater
(Art. 83, Paragraph 5). Data processors (i.e., entities who process
personal data) will now be obliged to comply with data protection
requirements which previously only applied to data controllers (i.e.,
entities who determine why and how personal data are processed). **[The
GDPR will apply regardless whether the processing takes place in the EU
or not,]{.underline}** and applies processing activities that are
related to the offering of goods or services and monitoring their
behavior**[. This regulation gives data subjects the right to access
information collected about them, and also requires data processors to
ensure data subjects are notified about the data collected (Articles 13
-- 15). It further recognizes that transparency is a key principle. Data
must be treated in a transparent manner (Art. 5, §1a)), transparency may
occur in the treatment itself (Art. 13, §2 and Art. 14, §2), and the
information communicated by the data controller to the data subject must
be transparent (Art. 12, §1).]{.underline}** The codes of conduct and
certification mechanisms must also respect this transparency principle
(Art. 40, §2a) and (Art. 42, §3), and transparency also applies to
decisionmaking (Art. 22). Furthermore, this article gives individuals
the right to object to decisions made about them purely on the basis of
automated processing when those decisions have significant/legal
effects. **[Other provisions in the Regulation gives data subjects the
right to obtain information about the existence of an automated decision
making system, the logic involved and its significance and envisaged
consequences.]{.underline}** In addition, the article 22 of the
regulation provides the obligation for the data processor to add
additional "safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject",
when profiling takes place. Although the article does not elaborate what
these safeguards are beyond "the right to obtain human intervention",
Articles 13 and 14 state that, when profiling takes place, a data
subject has the right to "meaningful information about the logic
involved". Towards satisfying various points of this regulation, and
more generally ensuring that the worst fears about AI and ML do not come
into effect, we propose various types of solutions which must be
developed in collaboration between lawyers, policy makers, and computer
scientists in order to ensure a fair and balanced society in the
presence of algorithms.

3 Proposed Solutions

[To begin, we draw a comparison between the regulation of algorithms and
regulations ensuring food safety. **Consumers must trust the food that
producers and distributors provide on the market**. The EU General Food
Law Regulation establishes basic criteria for whether a food item is
safe.]{.underline} **[If we instead think of data and algorithms instead
of food, one could similarly build a system that is meant to guarantee
safety to the functioning of algorithms, following the same reasoning as
the EU General Food Law Regulation.]{.underline}** Figure 1 draws this
parallel between the food law regulation and our proposed regulation of
algorithms. Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 of the European Parliament and
of the Council of 28 January 2002 lays down the general principles and
requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety
Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety. On a
similar basis, we propose that an EU Regulation dedicated to algorithms,
accompanied with European Algorithms Safety Authority laying down
procedures in matters of algorithms. This could involve establishing
codes of conduct (such as the Food Law Practice guidance), developing
third party quality control labels (such as organic certification) and
establishing transparency by careful regulation and monitoring of data
use as it propagates through various algorithms and tools (as is done
when tracing food through the food chain). Lastly, we call on algorithm
designers to further push towards developing the technical tools
required to detect, prevent, and correct algorithmic and data biases.

3.1 Codes of Conduct

On 27 June 2017, the European Commission fined Google a record-breaking
e2.42 billion for antitrust violations pertaining to its shopping search
comparison service. It ordered Google to comply with the simple
principle of giving equal treatment to rival comparison shopping
services and its own service. Competition commissioner Margrethe
Vestager said that "Google has given its own comparison shopping service
an illegal advantage by abusing its dominance in general internet
search. It has promoted its own service, and demoted rival services. It
has harmed competition and consumers. That's illegal under EU antitrust
rules." In effect, Google systematically gave disproportionately
prominent placement to its own shopping service in its search results.
As a result, Google's comparison shopping service is much more visible
to consumers in Google's search results, whilst rival comparison
shopping services are much less visible. This appeared to be the result
of an explicit code in Google's algorithm whose intent was to
discriminate against other services. Burrell identifies between three
barriers to transparency \[Burrell, 2016\]: 1) intentional concealment
on the part of corporations or other institutions, 2) gaps in technical
literacy which, for most people, mean that having access to underlying
code is insufficient, and 3) a lack of interpretability of the decisions
made by the algorithm even to experts. For barrier 1, clear codes of
conduct that are enforceable, as demonstrated in the example with Google
above, is a crucial first step.

3.2 Quality Labels and Audits

[**To increase transparency, one possibility could be to open the code
to public scrutiny.** The main drawback to this approach would be the
harm it could cause to the valuable intellectual property exposed, and
barriers 2 and 3, which state that, even if made public, the results
would not be interpretable.]{.underline} As \[Lisboa, 2013\] notes,
["machine learning approaches are alone in the spectrum in their lack of
interpretability". Hence, **we instead propose that quality labels --
similar, e.g., to organic certification, Minergie label, quality
management systems and insurance certification (9001 ISO norms), IT
security certification (ISO 27 001 norms or Information Technology
Infrastructure Library) be made available on a voluntary
basis.**]{.underline} The GDPR allows the data controller or processor
to draft approved codes of conduct or get a certification on data
protection to demonstrate the fulfillment of its duties. The codes of
conduct will be approved by the competent authority. The monitoring of
compliance with a code of conduct pursuant to Article 40 of GDPR may be
carried out by a body which has an appropriate level of expertise in
relation to the subjectmatter of the code, and is accredited for that
purpose by the competent supervisory authority. The certification can be
done by a limited number of certification bodies (Art. 43 GDPR) or by
the competent supervisory authority, on the basis of criteria approved
by that competent supervisory authority pursuant to Art. 58, §3 GDPR or
by the Board (Art. 63 GDPR). Where the criteria are approved by the
Board, this may result in a common certification - the European Data
Protection Seal. Certification may be issued for a maximal period of
three years (renewable). The Board shall collate all certification
mechanisms and data protection seals and marks in a register and shall
make them publicly available by any appropriate means (Art. 42 GDPR).
The GDPR empowers the regulator to conduct audits and inspections of
companies on demand. Strict new compliance requirements are imposed. For
example, entities have to perform "Privacy Impact Assessments" and
privacy audits as a matter of course. They have to implement "Privacy by
Design" methodologies into their business, so that compliance is
baked-in to everything they do. They also have to deliver on a new
"Accountability" obligation, which means creating written compliance
plans, which they will have to deliver to regulators on demand.

3.3 Transparency in the Data Chain

[Algorithms must be designed so that a human can interpret the
outcome]{.underline} \[Goodman and Flaxman, 2016\]. However, there is a
trade-off between the representation and interpretation of algorithms.
Simpler models are easier to explain, but also fail to capture complex
interactions among many variables. This also happens to be one of the
biggest issues with neural networks, because while they give excellent
results in practice, we have very sparse theoretical understanding for
them and therefore they are almost completely uninterpretable. Making
reference to the GDPR, \[Goodman and Flaxman, 2016\] highlighted that
"while this law will pose large challenges for industry, it highlights
opportunities for computer scientists to take the lead in designing
algorithms and evaluation frameworks which avoid discrimination and
enable explanation". The notion of a "right to explanation" \[Goodman
and Flaxman, 2016\] for an automated decision is correlated to the right
to obtain an "explanation of system's functionality". Meaningful
information must be provided about the logic involved as well as the
significance and the envisaged consequences of such a processing to the
data subject (under Articles 15.1.h and 14.2.g). **[Appropriate
safeguards should include the ability of data subjects "to obtain an
explanation of the decision reached after such assessment" (recital 71).
Data controllers will have to provide satisfactory explanations for
specific automated decisions, i.e., they will have to give the reason
why the AI/ML model gives the outputs it does.]{.underline}** This will
be especially difficult for AI/ML systems, whose outcome may vary from
one test to another even if the attributes remain the same. Providing
transparency to machine learning systems and black boxes will be a
significant technical challenge. Transparency about the personal
attributes used by the organizations may allow the data subject to use
the decision tree \[Rivest, 1987\] to follow its logic and gain
meaningful information about its significance and the envisaged
consequences of such a processing \[Wachter et al., 2017\]. The data
subject could work out what decisions the model would recommend based on
a variety of different values for the attributes it considers.
Transparency about the logic and likely effects of the automated
decision-making system given the person's personal circumstances,
transparency about the values used by the algorithm and how it was
trained should be guaranteed. Log files may help bringing those
guarantees. We propose to create a data chain traceability, based on the
same pattern as the food chain cycle (see Figure 1). Farm Processing
Center Logistic Warehouse Food Chain Cycle Transparent Algorithm
Development Training Data Collection Algorithm Design Transparent Model
Training Deployment Figure 1: This figure illustrates the symmetries
between the food chain cycle and the transparent algorithm development.
Different regulations and codes of conducts can be devised for each of
the steps in algorithm development to ensure overall transparency.

3.4 De-biasing Datasets and Algorithms

According to \[Zliobait ˇ e, 2017 ˙ \], "Discrimination-aware data
mining studies how to make predictive models free from discrimination,
when historical data, on which they are built, may be biased,
incomplete, or even contain past discriminatory decisions". There are
two main parts to discriminationaware machine learning, namely
discrimination detection and discrimination prevention. Discrimination
detection involves finding discriminatory patterns in the training data.
Discrimination prevention, on the other hand, entails the development of
algorithms which are free from discrimination even on datasets on which
standard AI models may discriminate. The traditional approach to
discrimination detection is to fit a regression model to the training
data and look at the regression coefficients of the potentially
discriminating features such as race, gender etc. The magnitude and the
statistical significance of these coefficients can tell us about the
possibility of discrimination in the dataset. Discrimination prevention
on the other hand can be applied in one of the following three stages of
the data processing pipeline according to \[Zliobait ˇ e, 2017 ˙ \]: a)
data preprocessing, b) model postprocessing, and c) model
regularization. Data preprocessing is when the training data is
preprocessed to remove the discrimination from it and then standard AI
models are used for prediction on the cleaned data. Model
post-processing starts with standard model and modifies it to
incorporate the nondiscrimination condition in it. And model
regularization adds some constraints to the optimization problem to
ensure nondiscrimination. Discrimination-aware machine learning is still
in its nascent stage of research and much more needs to be done before
it can be incorporated as part of the law.

4 Conclusion

As the new economic business models worldwide are based on data mining
and algorithms, **[a balance has to be found between encouraging
innovation with a flexible regulation while protecting the fundamental
rights and freedom of people.]{.underline}** In the EU, the Charter of
Fundamental Rights became legally binding on the European Union in
December of 2009, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. The
Charter contains rights and freedoms under six titles: Dignity,
Freedoms, Equality, Solidarity, Citizens' Rights, and Justice. Building
AI Safeguards in order to ensure the respect of those fundamental rights
as well as a proper, safe, and reliable functioning of algorithms must
be a priority. These safeguards should consider designing accountable
algorithms in a way that ensures that ethical principles are encoded in
the algorithms. **[Transparency and trust of algorithms is of key
importance to ensure the equal treatment among people and the adequate
functioning of a true democratic system]{.underline}**. In this paper we
surveyed recent formal advances, and consider what other mechanisms
should be put in place. We consider this to be an important first step
-- enacting this vision will require a concerted effort by policy
makers, lawyers and computer scientist alike.

### 1NC---CANT SOLVE CHINESE AI

#### CCP State Control guarantees that Chinese AI continues to be unregulated

**Zeng '20** (Jinghan, professor of China and International Studies at
Lancaster University, "Artificial intelligence and China's authoritarian
governance", Published October 13th, 2020,
https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/96/6/1441/5922010?login=true,
Accessed 7/9/2022)

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform
our governments and societies. An AI revolution may make future
governments more digital, efficient and economic than ever before. [Yet
despite all the benefits that AI offers when applied in governance,
western democratic societies have considerable concerns regarding civil
rights. The authoritarian regime in China, on the other hand, has chosen
to fully embrace the age of AI.]{.underline} Nowadays, AI has become a
buzzword not only in the capital market but also in the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP). [To develop AI is now considered China\'s
national strategy, with a clear goal of making the country a leading AI
power.1]{.underline} China\'s open ambition in this field has alarmed
many of its competitors, especially in the United States and Europe,
where many view it as an open challenge to American AI supremacy.2 [In
the context of global power transition, the so-called 'AI race' between
China and the United States has opened up a new front in their already
intense geopolitical competition.]{.underline} The US--China AI race is
not only a technological competition but also an ideological one.
[China\'s bold practices of applying AI technologies in state governance
have further contested the superiority of western liberal democracy.3
This article examines the Chinese governance approach towards AI. It
shows that China\'s bold use of AI practices in governance represents an
attempt not only to build a more efficient and capable government to
deliver better public services, but also to strengthen state control to
ensure the continuation of the authoritarian order.]{.underline} The
article argues that the application of AI in China\'s governance should
be understood in the wider context of the CCP\'s broad and incoherent
strategy of adaptation to governance by digital means. The CCP\'s
successful employment of digital technologies to strengthen its
governance is made possible by China\'s unique socio-political
environment. China\'s huge internet market has provided, in effect,
unlimited data with which to train and advance AI programs. [As the
world shifts from 'the age of expertise to the age of data',4 data are a
strategic resource that lays the foundation for digital technologies
such as AI]{.underline}. As Kaifu Lee, one of the most prominent figures
in the Chinese internet sector, points out, data---rather than computing
power and AI talents---constitute the most important factor to ensure
successful AI algorithms, as 'once computing power and engineering
talent reach a certain threshold, the quantity of data becomes decisive
in determining the overall power and accuracy of an algorithm'.5 In
2019, China had over 854 million internet users---and, with this
representing only 61.2 per cent of its 1.3 billion population, long-term
growth potential;6 by comparison, the United States had only 312 million
users with less than 10 per cent offline population in which to expand.7
In this respect, as the 'Saudi Arabia of data', China has considerable
comparative advantage in developing its AI industry.8 Moreover, [weak
civil awareness within Chinese society, combined with the CCP\'s strong
state power, including a well-resourced domestic security sector, has
put the regime in a favourable position not only to exploit its data
advantage but also to enhance state control via digital means. For
example, China is now leading AI technology in areas such as facial
recognition that Europe and the United States have put on hold---or even
banned---owing to privacy concerns.]{.underline} [In contrast to western
democratic societies, for China the key barrier to AI advancement lies
in technological rather than legal constraints.]{.underline} More
importantly, AI is not just another powerful tech tool to boost China\'s
digital surveillance; AI\'s automation of decision-making capability
without human intervention is unleashing the potential of China\'s
sophisticated digital surveillance network in ways that this article
will explore. In this respect, the [Chinese approach towards digital
technology has to date been successful in furthering state power and
capacity.]{.underline}

###  2NC---NO SOLVENCY

#### Cyber deterrence fails

**Whyte 20** Christopher Whyte, 11/25/2020, assistant professor of

In terms of the strategic logic of engagement in the domain, the [PE
strategy largely emerges from the work of Richard Harknett and Michael
Fischerkeller during their time as scholars attached to Cyber
Command.]{.underline} The [authors argue that the unique character of
cyberspace means that traditional deterrent approaches are **doomed to
failure.**]{.underline}36 Given that [deterrence involves strong
demonstrations of defense or meaningful statements of
punishment]{.underline}, they contend, [prospects for developing a
sustainable deterrent posture online are limited]{.underline} (or so the
architects of the new approach hold).37 [It **is extremely difficult**
to demonstrate defensive capabilities at the scale demanded by a
national cyber deterrent strategy, and **punishment rarely works** in
the way it is intended. Communicating specific meaning in retaliation is
difficult, particularly where the diversity of activities that
constitute cyber conflict is immensely high]{.underline}. Moreover,
[response options are often not ready to execute in the time frame
required by policy makers that seek to deter]{.underline}. And
[conceptual agreement on the significance or role of certain elements of
the domain is not easy to come by, with poor understanding of what might
be meant---if anything---by sovereignty online being a hallmark of the
digital world.]{.underline}

### 1NC---PLAN FAILS

#### Military adoption of AI fails- insert warrants

**Horowitz and Scharre,** 20**21 -** Senior Fellows at the Technology
and National Security Program at the Center for a New American Security
\[Michael and Paul, Jan 12, "AI and International Stability: Risks and
Confidence-Building Measures"

EZG\]

A [challenge for military adoption of AI is that two key risks
associated with new technology adoption are in tension.]{.underline}
[First, militaries could fail to adopt---or adopt quickly enough or
employ in the right manner---a new technology that yields significant
battlefield advantage.]{.underline} As a recent example, [despite the
overall growth in the military uninhabited, or unmanned, aircraft
market, the adoption of uninhabited vehicles has, at times, been a
source of contention within the U.S. defense establishment, principally
based on debates over the merits of this new technology relative to
existing alternatives.17]{.underline} Alternatively, [militaries could
adopt an immature technology too quickly, betting heavily and
incorrectly on new and untested propositions about how a technology may
change warfare.]{.underline} Given the natural incentive militaries have
in ensuring their capabilities work on the battlefield, it may be
reasonable to assume that militaries would manage these risks reasonably
well, although not without some mishaps. [But when balancing the risk of
accidents versus falling behind adversaries in technological innovation,
militaries arguably place safety as a secondary
consideration]{.underline}.18 Militaries may be relatively accepting of
the risk of accidents in the pursuit of technological advantage, since
accidents are a routine element of military operations, even in
training.19 Nevertheless, there are strong bureaucratic interests in
ultimately ensuring that fielded capabilities are robust and secure, and
existing institutional processes may be able to manage AI safety and
security risks with some adaptation. [For militaries, balancing between
the risks of going too slow versus going too fast with AI adoption is
complicated by the fact that AI, and deep learning in particular, is a
relatively **immature technology** with **significant vulnerabilities
and reliability concerns**.]{.underline}20 These [concerns are
heightened in situations where there may not be ample data on which to
train machine learning systems. Machine learning systems generally rely
on very large data sets, which may not exist in some military settings,
particularly when it comes to early warning of rare events (such as a
nuclear attack) or tracking adversary behavior in a multidimensional
battlefield. When trained with inadequate data sets or employed outside
the narrow context of their design, **AI systems are often unreliable
and brittle.** AI systems can often seem deceptively capable, performing
well (sometimes better than humans) in some laboratory settings, then
**failing dramatically** under changing environmental conditions **in
the real world**.]{.underline} Self-driving cars, for example, may be
safer than human drivers in some settings, then inexplicably turn deadly
in situations where a human operator would not have trouble.
Additionally, [deep learning methods may, at present, be insufficiently
reliable for safety-critical applications even when operating within the
bounds of their design specifications.21]{.underline} For example,
[concerns about limits to the reliability of algorithms across
demographic groups have hindered the deployment of facial recognition
technology in the United States]{.underline}, particularly in
high-consequence applications such as law enforcement. [Militaries, too,
should be **concerned about technical limitations and vulnerabilities**
in their AI systems.]{.underline} Militaries want technologies that
work, especially on the battlefield. Accordingly, the [AI strategy of
the Department of Defense (DoD) calls for AI systems that are
"resilient, robust, reliable, and secure."22 This is undoubtedly the
correct approach but a challenge, at least in the near term, given the
reliability issues facing many uses of algorithms today and the **highly
dynamic conditions of battlefield use**.]{.underline} An [additional
challenge stems from security dilemma dynamics. **Competitive
pressures** could **lead nations to shortcut test and
evaluation**]{.underline} (T&E) [in a desire to field new AI
capabilities ahead of adversaries.]{.underline} Similar competitive
pressures to beat others to market appear to have played an exacerbating
role in accident risk relating to AI systems in self-driving cars and
commercial airplane autopilots.23 [Militaries evaluating an AI system of
uncertain reliability could, not unjustifiably, **feel pressure to
hasten deployment** if they believe others are taking similar measures.
Historically, these pressures are highest immediately before and during
wars, where the risk/reward equation surrounding new technologies can
shift due to the very real lives on the line.]{.underline} For example,
[competitive pressures may have spurred the faster introduction of
poison gas in World War I.24 Similarly, in World War II, Germany
diverted funds from proven technologies into jet engines, ballistic
missiles, and helicopters, even though none of the technologies proved
mature until after the war.25 This **dynamic risk** might **spark a
self-fulfilling prophecy** in which **countries accelerate deployment**
of **insufficiently tested AI systems** out of the fear that others will
deploy first.26 The net effect is not an arms race but a "**race to the
bottom" on safety**, leading to the **deployment of unsafe AI systems**
and **heightening the risk of accidents and instability.**]{.underline}

**The UN should create a subcommittee that \[plan\]**

 

#### A subcommittee encourages multilateralism and facilitates effective AI governance.

What role for the United Nations? In his address to the General Assembly
[in September 2018, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that
'multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it
most']{.underline}. But among the many pressing problems that call for a
multilateral approach to be properly addressed[, he]{.underline}
[highlighted two 'epochal challenges' in particular]{.underline}:
climate change, which is of course of great concern but not covered in
this article, and [risks associated with advances in
technology.]{.underline} Indeed, '[rapidly developing fields such as
artificial intelligence, blockchain and biotechnology have the potential
to turbocharge progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals',
Guterres said]{.underline}. On the other hand, [new technologies also
present serious perils along the way, from mass economic unemployment to
cybercrime and malicious use of digital tools]{.underline}.35 Guterres
cautioned against the weaponization of AI and the possibility of a
dangerous arms race in this domain, including the development of lethal
autonomous weapons systems, going so far as to contend that 'the
prospect of machines with the discretion and power to take human life is
morally repugnant'. [Less oversight over these weapons could severely
compromise efforts to contain threats, prevent escalation, and ensure
compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law. He
urged Member States 'to use the United Nations as a platform to draw
global attention to these crucial matters and to nurture a digital
future that is safe]{.underline} and beneficial for all'. To lead by
example and engage the UN Secretariat in this enterprise, the
SecretaryGeneral launched his own Strategy on New Technologies, with the
objective of defining how the UN system will support the use of these
technologies to accelerate the achievement of the 2030 Sustainable
Development Agenda and to facilitate their alignment with the values
enshrined in the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
and the norms and standards of international law. [Among the pledges and
commitments to pursue this strategy were deepening the UN's internal
capacities and exposure to emerging technologies; increasing
understanding, advocacy, and dialogue; supporting dialogue on normative
and cooperation frameworks; and enhancing UN system support to
government capacity development.]{.underline} 37 In the same vein, the
High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation was established by the
Secretary-General in 2017 to promote dialogue and look into proposals to
build trust and cooperation between countries and other stakeholders,
the private sector, research centers, civil society, and academia. [In
its report, released in June 2019, the Panel envisaged several potential
roles for the UN to add value in the digital
transformation:]{.underline} as a convener; providing a space for
debating values and norms; generating standard setting; holding
multi-stakeholder or bilateral initiatives on specific issues;
[developing the capacity of Member States]{.underline}; ranking,
mapping, and measuring cybersecurity; and making available arbitration
and dispute-resolution mechanisms. [The report put forward various
recommendations, such as adopting by 2020 a 'Global Commitment for
Digital Cooperation' to consolidate in a single political document
shared values, principles, understandings, and objectives]{.underline}
regarding the governance of cyberspace. Also, it did not shy away from
making principled statements of ethical significance, the stipulation
that 'life and death decisions should not be delegated to machines'
being a case in point.38 [Most of the UN initiatives on new technologies
are focused upon the implementation of the Sustainable Development
Goals]{.underline}, such as the annual ECOSOC's Science, Technology, and
Innovation Forum, which had its fourth edition in May 2019. On the AI
front, the flagship UN platform for global dialogue with the wider
public is the AI for Good Global Summit, hosted every year in Geneva by
the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in partnership with
other UN agencies, the XPrize Foundation (organization offering
incentivize prize competitions) and the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM).39 This interdisciplinary event brings together speakers
from governments, industry, academia, media, and the research community
to discuss how AI can be utilized to achieve inter alia results in
ending poverty, alleviating hunger, promoting health, and identifying
development solutions. The UN Interregional Crime and Justice Research
Institute (UNICRI) established in 2017 a Center for Artificial
Intelligence and Robotics in The Hague, with the aim of disseminating
information, undertaking training activities, and promoting public
awareness. The Center has notably been active in cybercrime, law
enforcement, criminal justice, counter-terrorism, and malicious use of
AI.40 Also important is UNESCO's humanistic approach on ethics, policy,
and capacity building in response to new emerging challenges related to
AI technologies, including philosophical reflections on what it means to
be human in the face of disruptive technologies from the ethical
perspective. 41 The New York-based Centre for Policy Research of the
United Nations University (UNU) has been conducting foresight analyses,
developing collaborative research projects with external partners, and
convening policy seminars and events. In 2018, the Centre launched an
on-line platform on AI and Global Governance to foster
cross-disciplinary insights and 'inform existing debates from the lens
of multilateralism', as a tool for Member States, multilateral agencies,
funds, programs, and other stakeholders.42 [The UN Institute for
Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) has a research project on the
weaponization of increasingly autonomous technologies since 2013,
anchored in the idea that mitigating or reducing potential harms caused
by AI will be crucial to harness 'AI for Good']{.underline}. 43 More
broadly, UNIDIR's objectives in studying the relationship between AI and
international security aim at further clarifying functional concerns in
the development and future deployment of autonomous weapons systems,
including the risk of accidents; manipulation and other vulnerabilities
in weaponization; changes in the nature of conflict and their impact
upon strategic stability; commercial development of AI-related
technologies and its links with the defense industry; access to
sensitive technologies and their use to conduct asymmetric warfare; and
the structural effects of the AI revolution on geopolitics and power
dynamics in the international system.44 In turn, the UN Office for
Disarmament Affairs (UNODA), both in New York and in Geneva, has been
working to implement the Secretary-General's Agenda for Disarmament
(Securing Our Common Future), which includes the consideration of
possible challenges posed by new weapon technologies. One of the action
points of the Agenda seeks to support efforts by Member States 'to
elaborate new measures, including through political or legally binding
arrangements, to ensure that humans remain at all times in control over
the use of force'.45 Other initiatives include the UN Innovation
Network, connecting a collaborative community of innovators within the
UN System, as well as a myriad of projects developed by UN agencies to
apply AI tools in their daily practice in the field Despite the relative
lack of clarity on the way forward, the future role of the UN will be
inextricably linked to the global governance of AI. [Research and policy
proposals on this topic are beginning to shed light upon the likelihood
of international cooperation on transformative AI-related issues,
incentives needed for the parties to reach meaningful agreements, proper
conditions for compliance, and costs of defection or unilateral,
non-cooperative measures.]{.underline} 46 Proposals range from informal
mechanisms in narrowly-focused domains to much more ambitious,
institutionalized forums, such as the establishment of an international
regulatory agency, to be named, for example, the 'International
Artificial Intelligence Organization' (IAIO), aimed at setting standards
and benchmarks across numerous areas to be regulated. However, even the
proponents of such broad-spectrum organization concede that reaching a
workable international consensus on this idea seems rather a remote
possibility in the short term. 47 Another proposition to consider is
creating a new body modeled on the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) to provide policymakers with technical, neutral
assessments, subject to review by states, underlining the opportunities,
implications, and potential risks of AI, always through evidence-based
research by the tech and scientific communities.[48 A case can be made
for an 'Intergovernmental Panel on Artificial Intelligence' (IPAI), as
Miailhe did, to gather a large interdisciplinary group of experts with a
mandate to collect, organize, and analyze credible and up-to-date
information on AI challenges.]{.underline} 49 As technologies become
more and more sophisticated and indecipherable to the layman, sound
[technical advice will be in high demand if intergovernmental
negotiations are to be launched]{.underline} to tackle these thorny
issues, separating myth, hype, and misinformation from what is in tune
with the body of evidence and human knowledge available so far.
Politicians obviously have no need to know technicalities about
reinforcement learning, multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural
networks, or Boltzmann machines. But [as AI puzzles and their impact
upon society become increasingly relevant in the real world, AI
researchers cannot deny that suitable communication with the political
leadership will be of paramount importance to guide
decisionmaking]{.underline} in the right direction. One key challenge is
to keep the major players engaged, so that AI governance can be
instrumental in providing stability to safeguard the system in
everyone's interest. Even though some proposals may require more time
for maturation, others could be implemented in a more straightforward
manner, without the need for a fully-fledged, previous commitment from
governments on the parameters and preconditions deemed appropriate for
establishing new criteria at the international level. Advisory and
non-binding settings involving states, the private sector, and civil
society could be a first step if focused upon information gathering,
independent analyses, and recommendations geared at prevention rather
than regulation per se. Traditional, institutionally-based
intergovernmental diplomacy seems too slow if compared with the
staggering pace of technological innovation. Informal, ad-hoc,
plurilateral initiatives spurred by some like-minded countries
('coalitions of the willing') may at times promote added value in
governance, but they usually lack universal appeal and raise suspicious
of their agendas in the eyes of states left outside these groups. [A
better solution to escape shortterm paralysis \[immobilization\] is for
the UN, with the authority and legitimacy conferred to it by Member
States, to take the lead and offer a collective space, open to all,
strictly voluntary, to encourage cooperation and work on prevention,
capacity-building, and normative recommendations. A good example along
these lines would be the creation of a 'Global Foresight Observatory' on
the convergence of AI with other emerging technologies, under the
auspices of the UN, as envisaged in the report of UNU's Centre for
Policy Research]{.underline}, i.e. a multi-stakeholder, inclusive
platform to foster cooperation in technological and political
preparedness for responsive innovation.50 This [sort of initiative fits
well with what the UN can do even in hardknock situations.]{.underline}
Trying to be too ambitious from the very beginning may backlash and lead
nowhere. It is essential not to allow resistance from becoming lethargic
and continue exploring alternatives to take concrete steps in AI
governance in a robust and comprehensive manner.

#### Debates about AI tend to leave the global South behind---the growing, militarized issue should involve their input.

[Artificial intelligence (AI) will have a profound impact upon world
politics across the board, as much as upon society generally. Converging
technologies that often overlap and affect each other have become
drivers of innovation]{.underline}, as in the case of nanotechnology,
biotechnology, information technology, and cognitive science (NBIC).
[Usage of AI in business, government, and everyday life has been
developing at breakneck pace,]{.underline} fueled by powerful hardware
capacity, abundant data, and online training of self-learning
algorithms[. As]{.underline} the discipline of International Relations
[(IR) takes on this expanding research field and its systemic
implications, a coming AI race has frequently been portrayed as a
perilous trend capable of reshaping the character of international
security. 1 An overview of state initiatives, strategies, and related
governmental investments in AI reported]{.underline} that at the time of
writing [less than 20 countries had active AI national plans and, not
surprisingly, almost all of them were developed countries]{.underline}.2
Indeed, there is no [shortage of analyses focusing upon]{.underline}
great-power competition and [an epic struggle for AI global supremacy,
picturing prominently the United States and China, followed closely by
military powers and wealthy nations]{.underline} (Russia, G7 countries,
Israel, and others), and a few second-tier, aspiring tech players, which
may occupy someday a special place in the AI landscape.3 [The Global
South]{.underline}, however, [is clearly underrepresented in this
debate, with many areas of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean
completely absent in terms of scholars, politicians, and
policymakers]{.underline} engaged in this vital conversation. And yet,
when it comes to assess global risks in peace and security and identify
where new AI weapons are likely to be deployed in the first place, [both
researchers and practitioners in the developing world have reasons to be
concerned]{.underline}. It is no wonder that proponents of a Global IR
have been urging for greater participation from actors of the
non-Western world as a means to 'bring the Rest in'. 4 This article will
take as a starting point the fact that [the militarization of AI has
already begun and will pose many challenges beyond the realm of security
itself. I argue that AI governance is also bound to gain traction and
the United Nations will eventually get further involved]{.underline} in
providing space for international cooperation and facilitating
negotiations on how to deal with controversies surrounding AI
policymaking. In this context, diplomatic deliberations in Geneva on
lethal autonomous weapons systems are a revealing case-study of
opportunities and predicaments encountered along the way, insofar as
they highlight inter alia how critical it is for the Global South to be
abreast of developments in this area, prepare in advance, and act
accordingly on distinct fronts.

 

 

#### The UN works within international frameworks, more so than NATO

**Fournier-Tombs '21** (Eleonore, data scientist, researcher and author
at United Nations University Institute Macau, "Towards a United Nations
Internal Regulation for Artificial Intelligence, Published August 30,
2021, Accessed 7/13/2022,
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20539517211039493)

On 21 April 2021, the [European Commission published a proposal for a
regulation on artificial intelligence (AI) (European Commission, 2021),
the first of its kind to attempt to integrate the multi-tentacled beast
that is AI. The document enters into detail in terms of definitions and
uses of the technologies, as well as very important sections on the
forbidden uses of AI and high-risk activities, proposing that the latter
go through an authorisation process]{.underline} much like a drug or a
car would before being made available to the public. However, as set out
in Article 2, the regulation does not apply to international
organisations, regardless of whether they are operating in European
Union (EU) territory. Naturally, the EU does not have jurisdiction over
international organisations such as the United Nations, which is
governed by international law ([United Nations, 2021]{.underline}). The
exclusion therefore does not come as a surprise but does point to a gap
in the AI regulation, especially since technologies that are classified
as forbidden or high risk for European citizens would presumably be also
very risky for all other citizens, regardless of nationality.
Furthermore, as explained by Bradford (2020) in *The Brussels Effect,*
the EU is known to set regulatory precedents globally. It is therefore
likely that the new regulation will have a ripple effect, which would
reach many other countries. [In that context, regulating at the United
Nations itself would be an important way for the organisation to
demonstrate its leadership on this important societal
issue.]{.underline} The activities of the United Nations are regulated
in a series of legal instruments in international law that have been
developed since the drafting of the Charter of the United Nations
([United Nations, 1945]{.underline}). The UN Charter sets out the role
of the Secretary General, the General Assembly, and the Security
Council, as well as the activities of UN Peacekeepers. Since 1945, there
have been a few amendments to the Charter, as well as Security Council
and General Assembly resolutions on issues that were not considered at
the onset of the organisation. [The United Nations itself is very likely
to develop a convention on AI, which member countries would likely sign
and possibly ratify (Garcia, 2020; [Latonero,
2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20539517211039493)).
However, such a document, like other United Nations conventions, would
consist of a commitment by its member states to more ethical AI
practices, rather than a regulation for the organisation itself to
follow.]{.underline} This article therefore sets out the rationale for a
[United Nations Regulation for Artificial Intelligence, which is needed
to set out the modes of engagement of the organisation when using AI
technologies in the attainment of its mission.]{.underline} It argues
that given the increasing use of AI by the United Nations, including in
some activities considered high risk by the European Commission, a
regulation is urgent. It also contends that rules of engagement for AI
at the United Nations would support the development of 'good artificial
intelligence'^1^, by giving developers clear pathways for authorisation
that would build trust in these technologies. Finally, it argues that an
internal regulation would build upon the work in AI ethics and best
practices already initiated in the organisation that could, like the
Brussels Effect, set an important precedent for regulations in other
countries. The United Nations' artificial intelligence ecosystem [AI
technologies have, over the past decade, been increasingly used by
United Nations agencies, funds and programs]{.underline}. Several
research and development labs, including the United Nations
Secretariat's [Global Pulse Lab (2021)]{.underline}, United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR\'s) Jetson initiative ([UNHCR,
2021]{.underline}), Innovation Labs ([UNICEF, 2021]{.underline}) and
United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCHA) Centre for Humanitarian Data ([OCHA, 2021a]{.underline}) have
focused their work on developing AI solutions that would support the
UN\'s mission, notably in terms of anticipating and responding to
humanitarian crises. These research labs are largely composed of United
Nations staff members and consultants trained in data science
technologies. Many of the research labs have developed proofs of
concept, which are yet to be integrated into the United Nations'
activities.^2^ [They aim, for example, to explore the use of AI
modelling in anticipating refugee arrivals (Jetson), predict coronavirus
disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases in countries with ongoing humanitarian
crises or better understand risks to the Sustainable Development Goals
(Global Pulse).]{.underline} United Nations agencies have also used
biometric identification to manage humanitarian logistics and refugee
claims. For example, Population Registration and Identity Management
Ecosystem (PRIMES) was launched in 2018 by UNHCR to provide a
centralised platform for the management of refugee data. By the end of
2018, the biometrics of 7.1 million refugees were managed by the
platform ([UNHCR, 2019]{.underline}). The World Food Programme (WFP) has
also used biometric identification in aid distribution to refugees,
coming under some criticism in 2019 for its use of this technology in
Yemen ([Raftree and Steinacker, 2019]{.underline}). In parallel,
however, the [organisation has begun partnering with private companies
that provide advanced analytical services. A notable example is the
WFP,]{.underline} that in 2019 signed a USD45-million-dollar contract
with Palantir, an American firm which specialised in data collection and
AI modelling ([Greenwood, 2019]{.underline}). In 2014, the United States
Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) awarded a USD20
billion-dollar contract to Palantir, to track undocumented immigrants in
the United States ([Woodman, 2017]{.underline}). Their methodology was a
classic case of what is called the 'Mosaic Effect', which is a technique
used by intelligence agencies, which involves using multiple data
sources to find personally identifiable information that might otherwise
have been obscured. This technique is discussed in some detail by OCHA
([OCHA 2021c]{.underline}), which explains that these databases can be
used to reidentify highly vulnerable populations such as migrants to
expel them from an area, recruit children for warfare, or otherwise
threaten their safety. Palantir used this technique as part of its ICE
contract by collecting and centralising large numbers of databases to
reveal the location of migrants, leading to their eventual expulsion.
Several human rights watchdogs, however, including Amnesty
International, have raised concerns about Palantir, writing in a
September 2020 report that: 'Given Palantir\'s increasingly entrenched
role in government operations and its multiple contracts across federal
agencies, concerns about its human rights record are growing in urgency
and deserve scrutiny' ([Amnesty International, 2020]{.underline}).

 

#### The UN can create ethical standards that globally build trust

**Fournier-Tombs '21** (Eleonore, data scientist, researcher and author
at United Nations University Institute Macau, "Towards a United Nations
Internal Regulation for Artificial Intelligence, Published August 30,
2021, Accessed 7/13/2022,
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20539517211039493)

Ethical frameworks and best practices As we have seen, just like most AI
initiatives developed in recent years globally, this work has happened
largely without regulatory oversight. However, there have been many
attempts within the organisation to set up ethical modes of operation,
as well as to influence AI ethics globally. For example, OCHA\'s Peer
Review Framework sets out a method for overseeing the technical
development and implementation of AI models ([OCHA, 2021b]{.underline}).
Its [objective is to provide a method for the review of models developed
by humanitarian organisations by peers in the same sector, thereby
providing a layer of validation that might hitherto not have
existed]{.underline}. While there is no legal obligation for developers
working with vulnerable populations to use it, [it does attempt to
increase accountability and transparency of models, in the hope of
attenuating its risks and building trust]{.underline} ITU has also
sought to encourage ethical uses of AI through its yearly conference
entitled *AI for Good*, which is specifically oriented towards uses of
AI that promote the Sustainable Development Goals. Several of *AI for
Good* talks listed for 2021 address the ethics of AI use in specific
cases, such as democratic participation or self-driving cars. However,
the approach appears more focused on promoting implementations that
drive sustainable development, rather than mitigating their possible
risks ([ITU, 2021]{.underline}). Finally, United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization [(UNESCO) has done considerable
work in AI ethics, notably by convening intergovernmental meetings since
2019 to articulate a recommendation on the ethics of AI. The 2020 draft
of this document focuses on values, such as transparency, gender equity,
human rights and fairness, among others]{.underline}. While different
from the European Commission\'s risks-based approach, this is certainly
aligned with other United Nations documents, such as the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, and the Convention on the Rights of the
Child. [Like the various United Nations Conventions, this document is
therefore aimed at Member States, and could possibly inform the future
United Nations convention on AI (UNESCO, 2020). Going a step further
than the recommendation, the convention would be voluntarily ratified by
Member States, who would then commit to following its principles in
their own jurisdictions.]{.underline} Even without a convention, [the
United Nations would certainly have an incentive to apply internally its
own recommendations to Member States. As such, the UNESCO work, along
with other efforts of the ITU, OCHA and other agencies, can certainly be
seen as building blocks towards a regulatory framework.]{.underline}
However, without legal backing, they are not sufficient to ensure the
safety of AI technologies as they are currently being used. Regulation
to build trust in implementations In addition, the [lack of AI
regulation at the United Nations can be considered a barrier for
agencies seeking to adopt more effective and novel
technologies.]{.underline} While some systems, such as the OCHA-Bucky
Model, which predicted COVID-19 cases in Afghanistan, Central African
Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, and Sudan, have
been deployed for humanitarian use ([OCHA, 2021d]{.underline}); others
appear not to have been integrated into actual decision-making systems.
An example of this is the Jetson tool, which was developed by UNHCR to
predict the arrival of internally displaced persons to refugee camps in
Somalia ([UNHCR, 2021]{.underline}). According to the project\'s
public-facing website, the tool has not been updated since 2019. Several
of the numerous proof-of-concept projects developed by the UN Global
Pulse have also not been deployed into production ([Global Pulse Lab,
2021]{.underline}). One of the most important difficulties in deploying
these solutions is related to trust, both in terms of internal adoption
of the tools by decision makers, as well as acceptance by the target
populations. Trust in artificial intelligence systems is notoriously
difficult to obtain, particularly in the work in which the United
Nations engages, which is highly political and impacts very vulnerable
populations. Some of the attempts at promoting transparency in AI, such
as the OCHA Peer Review Framework, can be seen as a way to build trust.
In fact, there have been other similar initiatives outside of the United
Nations, such as Datasheets for Datasets ([Gebru et al.,
2018]{.underline}) and Model Cards for Model Reporting ([Mitchell et
al., 2019]{.underline}), as well as IBM\'s AI Factsheet, which provide
tools for technical developers to explain their technologies, and
therefore increase public trust in them. As explained by [Aicardi et al.
(2021)]{.underline}, transparency is the most prevalent principle
included in AI ethics. In the EU Guidelines on AI, which served to
inform the 2021 regulation, transparency is listed as one of the 'seven
requirements in the realisation of a trustworthy AI.' [Rossi
(2019)]{.underline} describes lack of trust as one of the key obstacles
to the adoption of AI systems, regardless of the potential benefit. The
onus has largely been on the technical developers of these tools, such
as data scientists, computer scientists and engineers, to develop the
credibility of their tools. While the United Nations has invested, and
continues to invest, large amounts of money into research labs and
private partnerships, unless it is able to build internal and external
trust in them, it will also face important barriers in their
implementation. [A regulatory framework like the one proposed by the
European Commission, however, especially with an authorisation procedure
like the one described for high-risk activities, would take the pressure
off technology developers in the humanitarian sector to individually
justify their activities to decision-makers.]{.underline} Instead,
[agencies or research labs who wanted to develop an AI solution would
work towards authorisation,]{.underline} likely [quelling many internal
doubts as to the effectiveness, safety and accuracy of their
system.]{.underline} Given the powerful nature of AI, the [risks of
research and development initiatives and the threat of unregulated
public--private partnerships, an internal, enforceable United Nations
regulation on AI is highly recommended.]{.underline} An [UN-wide AI
regulation would not only protect the risks posed by the technologies to
the mission itself of the organisation, but it would also build trust in
those applications that are actually supporting its work. This is an
opportunity to concretise the efforts of the organisation in AI ethics
and best practices, as well as further demonstrate its leadership on an
issue of global importance.]{.underline}

#### The creates an IIGO which solves best

**Erdélyi and Goldsmith '18** (Olivia, faculty of Law at University of
Canterbury and Judy, faculty at University of Kentucky Department of
Computer Science, "Regulating Artificial Intelligence Proposal for a
Global Situation, Published February 2018, Accessed 7/13/2022,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3278721.3278731)

[International institutions are the prevalent vehicles of international
cooperation in our interconnected world. When a critical mass of states
and/or non-state actors feel that transnational cooperation is necessary
to solve a problem that is impossible to tackle by isolated national
measures, they establish a new IGO or NGO for that particular purpose.
Based on legal and international relations definitions in circulation
--- see \[9, 14, 18\] --- we define an IGO as a formal entity (1)
established by an international agreement governed by international law;
(2) with at least three (sometimes two) members]{.underline} ---
typically states but increasingly also IGOs; and (3) having at least one
organ with a will distinct from that of its members. FIGOs'
organizational purpose is laid down in a binding international agreement
such as a treaty or a formal legal act of another IGO, their membership
is clearly defined in the founding legal act, and they have a permanent
and significant institutionalization in place. By contrast, IIGOs
operate based on an explicitly shared, but informal expectation about
purpose, their membership is not always clear, as members are explicitly
associated but only by non-legal mutual acknowledgment, and they do not
possess any significant institutionalization. NGOs differ from IGOs in
that they are not created by treaty --- meaning they are governed by
national rather than international law --- and their membership is made
up of non-state actors. [Given the severity and global nature of AI's
anticipated impact on humanity, we expect it to join the long line of
issue areas requiring interstate cooperation, raising the question of
establishing an IGO at some point in the future. Against this
background, we propose the creation of the IAIO as a new IGO, which
could initially serve as a focal point of policy debates on AI-related
matters and --- given sufficient international support --- acquire
increasing role in their regulation over time. We start by determining
the degree of desired institutional formalization by examining, in turn,
the six above elaborated tradeoffs in relation to AI.]{.underline}

Binding commitment vs. flexible cooperation arrangements: As pointed out
earlier, AI will fundamentally transform human society worldwide. Since
this process of transformation is likely to be inescapable for any
single state, states will probably wish to cooperate sincerely. Also,
violations will be difficult to detect as keeping pace with
technological innovation will require considerable technical expertise
and capacities, presumably exceeding especially weaker countries'
capabilities and evoking severe power asymmetries. While apart from this
latter circumstance, these factors speak for hard legal commitments, it
must be kept in mind that AI research and AI-human interactions are
relatively young phenomena and their novelty severely restricts our
ability to anticipate the spectrum and extent of the impending changes,
let alone the dimension of the problems they will raise. Many AI
instantiations encroach on our most basic rights, pose an existential
threat, or bring up profound ethical and social questions, not to
mention that they will utterly and completely upset our legal system.
So, we are looking at heated debates among radically diverse parties
over a variety of uncertain issues, which may change in rapid and
currently unimaginable ways --- conditions that, based on past
experience, do not exactly favor international consensus. Therefore, we
need all the flexibility we can get to acquire familiarity with the
issues at hand, sort out differences, and establish common ground,
before we can contemplate drawing up a more binding framework for
cooperation. Delegation/high sovereignty costs vs. state autonomy/low
sovereignty costs: Weaponized AI technologies and certain data mining
practices are clearly relevant for national security. [As this is a
sensitive issue area involving particularly high sovereignty costs, at
least initially, states will show reluctance to give up and delegate
decisionmaking authority to the IAIO. On the long run, however, powerful
collective oversight and enforcement mechanisms will probably be
indispensable in order to curb incentives for violations and
opportunistic behavior, which should otherwise be high in light of the
major shifts in international power constellations triggered by changes
in countries' competitive positions. Also, domestic AI policies will
produce significant externalities, affecting other countries. Based on
this analysis, it is hard to escape the conclusion that a highly
institutionalized organization with binding legislative, dispute
resolution, and enforcement authority would be better suited as new
international AI regulator.]{.underline} Nevertheless, the political
reality remains that until sufficient clarity is reached on the IAIO's
precise purpose, membership, the issues to regulate, and the broad
directions to follow, international consensus supporting such a high
degree of institutionalization is off the table. Collective control of
information vs. close control of information: [History shows that states
are generally cautious about sharing information on fate-changing
technologies, which speaks for close control of information with respect
to AI. However, if and when we manage to gather consensus for hard legal
commitment]{.underline}s (e.g., treaty on certain AI applications), we
will probably need to be more forthcoming with certain information to
ensure compliance with those instruments. This is again a strong
argument in favor of starting cooperation on AI regulation in a softer
institutional framework and using soft law instruments, although a move
towards harder legalization seems to be desirable over time.

 

#### The counterplan models existing IIGOs and centralizes global AI policy

**Erdélyi and Goldsmith '18** (Olivia, faculty of Law at University of
Canterbury and Judy, faculty at University of Kentucky Department of
Computer Science, "Regulating Artificial Intelligence Proposal for a
Global Situation, Published February 2018, Accessed 7/13/2022,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3278721.3278731)

Low long-term transaction costs vs. low initial contracting costs:
International discussions on AI are just beginning and powerful states
will likely have divergent preferences with respect to the regulation of
this high-impact field. Compounded with the difficulties discussed in
the context of previous tradeoffs, this makes the prospect of reaching a
workable international consensus on the short term rather remote. Yet
crucially, swift regulatory response is imperative to prevent
proliferating unregulated AI applications from causing social harm and
to ensure that the opportunity presented by the rise of AI is harvested
to humanity's benefit rather than detriment --- an aim best facilitated
by lowering initial contracting costs with soft legalization and low
institutional formalization. This is not to say that the idea of setting
up a more robust regulatory framework with standard operating procedures
should be abandoned. On the contrary, such a step has merit but only at
a later stage, in possession of sufficient expertise and political
consensus to better assess the implications of various policy options
and formulate informed policy recommendations. Complex centralized
administration vs. minimalistic administrative functions: Similar
considerations apply as far as the level of administrative
sophistication of the IAIO is concerned. In the initial stage of
determining the purpose of the organization, its membership, the issues
that need to be regulated, and the backbone of its regulatory agenda,
less is probably more. Later, with perhaps binding legal instruments
governing selected aspects of AI for a wide membership, work will get
more complex, requiring stronger oversight, dispute resolution, and
enforcement mechanisms as well as more powerful bureaucratic functions
to service them. Routine management vs. crisis/uncertainty management:
In view of AI's novelty, extreme complexity, unforeseeable evolution,
and the controversies it is expected to elicit among a very
heterogeneous circle of members, we are up against managing an
extraordinarily uncertain issue area. Consequently, we need time and
soft legalization's flexibility to establish commonly shared ideas,
interests, cooperation mechanisms, and solutions, which can then form
the basis of more formalized cooperation arrangements in the future. In
summary, at least initially, the IAIO should start out as an IIGO
displaying a relatively low level of institutional formality and using
soft law instruments, such as non-binding recommendations, guidelines,
and standards, to support national policymakers in the conception and
design of AI-related regulatory policies. Its interim goal should be to
galvanize international cooperation in this domain as early as possible,
before states develop their own, diverging policies, which may be hard
to rescind without political damage. Whether the international community
wishes to move towards more formalized cooperation at some point in the
future, remains to be seen. Sometimes informality turns out to be the
key to an organization's success. This seems to be the case with the
Bank of International Settlements especially during its initial years of
operation and World War II, or the BCBS and the different GGroups at
present \[2\]. Another common trajectory is when initially informal
arrangements turn into formal frameworks of cooperation. A case in point
is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's (GATT) gradual
transformation into the WTO \[1\]. Finally, there are examples for
remarkably successful, sustained, complementary, and mutually beneficial
cooperation between several organizations of varying institutional
formality in the same issue area. This sort of relationship is
characteristic for the IMF and various G-Groups in financial regulation,
or the Australia Group (AG), an IIGO, and the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a FIGO, in the regulation of
chemical and biological weapons \[18\]. Our excursus in the domain of
international lawmaking shows that beyond the optimal level of
legalization and institutional formality, the IAIO must fulfill a number
of more subtle requirements to be perceived as a fair and legitimate
regulator. While leaving the elaboration of details to future research,
we would like to stress the importance of two points: (1) including an
interdisciplinary mix of experts (with, e.g., AI, legal, political, and
ethics background) in the initial deliberations related to the IAIO's
establishment, modus operandi, and regulatory agenda, and (2) conducting
regular, largescale consultation processes with a diverse spectrum of
interested stakeholders from public sector, industry, and academia, to
ensure due consideration of all relevant perspectives

[The E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [has launched several
initiatives aimed at developing a comprehensive AI strategy, including
its regulation]{.underline}. The three key documents in this regard are
the General Data Protection
Regulation[^[5]{.underline}^](http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1870-21472021000200035#fn5)
(GDPR), the European Parliament's Resolution of February 2017 on Civil
Laws for
Robotics[^[6]{.underline}^](http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1870-21472021000200035#fn6),
and the Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI produced by the European
Commission's High-Level Expert Group on Artificial
Intelligence[^[7]{.underline}^](http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1870-21472021000200035#fn7)
(AI HLEG), a final version of which was presented in April 2019.

Although the GDPR was not aimed specifically at AI, its provisions
nevertheless appear likely to have fairly drastic effects on the
industry even beyond what its drafters might have
intended.[^[8]{.underline}^](http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1870-21472021000200035#fn8)
The GDPR extends the scope of EU data protection law to all foreign
companies processing data of EU residents. The GDPR is intertwined with
AI for several reasons, including that it requires a certain amount of
explanation, which can be challenging with "black box" AI systems.
Article 22 GDPR stipulates that: "*In particular, the controller must
allow for a human intervention and the right for individuals to express
their point of view, to obtain further information about the decision
that has been reached on the basis of this automated processing, and the
right to contest this decision.***"** [The European Parliament's
Resolution of February 2017 on Civil Laws for Robotics includes
thought-provoking content, but it has not yet created binding law;
instead it was merely a recommendation to the Commission for future
action.]{.underline} Specifically, it is the preparatory document for
the drafting of a Directive concerning civil-law rules on robotics. The
results and a summary of this consultation were made available in a
later report published in October 2017. [Meanwhile, the European
Parliament voted on the resolution in February 2017 to regulate the
development of AI and robotics throughout the European Union. The Joint
Declaration on the EU's legislative priorities for 2018-2019 also named
data protection, digital rights, and ethical standards in artificial
intelligence and robotics as priorities.]{.underline} Taking up the
European Parliament's appeal to create binding legislation, the European
Commission issued a call in March 2018 for a High-Level Expert Group on
Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG), which, according to the Commission,
"*will serve as the steering group for the European AI Alliance's work,
interact with other initiatives, help stimulate a multi-stakeholder
dialogue, gather participants' views and reflect them in its analysis
and reports.***"** [The work of the AI HLEG includes "propos\[ing\] to
the Commission AI ethics guidelines, covering issues such as fairness,
safety, transparency, the future of work, democracy and more broadly the
impact on the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights,
including privacy and personal data protection, dignity, consumer
protection and
non-discrimination.]{.underline}"[^[9]{.underline}^](http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1870-21472021000200035#fn9)
An initial version of the guidelines was published on 18 December 2018
and the experts presented their final
version[[10]{.underline}](http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1870-21472021000200035#fn10)
to the Commission in April 2019 after extensive consultation throughout
the European AI Alliance. Based on fundamental rights and ethical
principles, the document lists seven key requirements that relevant
systems should meet in order to be trustworthy. Aiming to operationalise
these requirements, an assessment list is presented to provide guidance
on the requirements' practical implementation. This assessment list will
undergo a piloting process to which all interested stakeholders can
participate. The objective is to then bring Europe's ethical approach to
the global stage. The Commission is opening up cooperation to all non-EU
countries that are willing to share the same values. In April 2018, 25
[EU countries signed a joint declaration of cooperation on AI, the terms
of which included a commitment to "\[e\]xchange views on ethical and
legal frameworks related to AI in order to ensure responsible AI
deployment]{.underline}"[[11]{.underline}](http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1870-21472021000200035#fn11).
Subsequently, on 25 April 2018, the [European Commission adopted a
Communication on Artificial Intelligence for
Europe[12](http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1870-21472021000200035#fn12)
laying down the European approach to take utmost advantage of the
opportunities offered by AI and address the new corresponding challenges
of AI]{.underline}. In 2019, the Commission developed and made available
the Guidance on the interpretation of the Product Liability Directive to
prepare its reform in 2020. Also, on 7 December 2018, the Commission
submitted a Communication to the European Parliament, the European
Council, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the
Committee of the Regions entitled Coordinated Plan on Artificial
Intelligence[[13]{.underline}](http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1870-21472021000200035#fn13),
accompanied by the Coordinated Plan on the Development and Use of
Artificial Intelligence Made in Europe - 2018 prepared by Member States
(as part of the Group on digitizing European industry and Artificial
Intelligence), Norway, Switzerland, and the Commission. [Next, on 19
February 2020, the European Commission published a White
Paper[14](http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1870-21472021000200035#fn14)
aiming to foster a European ecosystem of excellence and trust in AI and
a Report on the safety and liability aspects of
AI.[15](http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1870-21472021000200035#fn15)
The White Paper proposes measures that will streamline research, foster
collaboration between Member States and increase investment into AI
development and deployment]{.underline}. It also proposes policy options
for an imminent EU regulatory framework that would determine the types
of legal requirements that would apply to relevant actors, with a
particular focus on high-risk applications. Finally, on 20 October 2020,
the European Parliament has approved three resolutions that analyze how
the European Union understands that different matters affected by
Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be regulated, while promoting
innovation, ethical standards and confidence in this technology. [These
resolutions analyze (i) the intellectual property rights for the
development of AI technologies (supporting an effective system to
guarantee them and to safeguard the European patent standards); (ii) the
civil liability regime in matters of AI (a regulatory framework is
proposed to guarantee the strict liability of the operators of "high
risk" AI systems in case of damages); and (iii) certain ethical aspects
of AI, robotics and related technologies (having as a key guiding
principle the human control and centrality). Despite these encouraging
signs and laudable intentions, the EU's regulatory agenda remains at a
nascent stage.]{.underline}
