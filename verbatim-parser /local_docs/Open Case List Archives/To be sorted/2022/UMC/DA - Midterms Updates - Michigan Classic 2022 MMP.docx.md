## Midterms Ups

### GOP won't win

#### Republicans won't win the senate---extreme candidates wreck chances

[Republicans have every reason to be optimistic]{.underline} about their
party's political prospects in this year's midterm elections.

Democrats are widely blamed for soaring inflation, President Biden's
approval rating just hit a [record
low](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-record-low-approval-rating/)
and the GOP has
[approximately](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2022-generic-congressional-vote-7361.html)
a 2-point advantage in the generic ballot for Congress. On top of that,
the party of the president has
[lost](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/)
House seats in every midterm election --- except for two --- since 1946
and has only gained Senate seats in four.

Even though it is essentially a guarantee that the GOP will win control
of the House, the fate of the Senate is much less uncertain. [Nate
Silver's](https://thehill.com/people/nate-silver/) FiveThirtyEight rates
the Senate as a
[toss-up](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/)
and gives Republicans a 53 percent chance of taking control of the
chamber; comparatively, his forecast gives the GOP an 88 percent chance
of winning the House.

Ultimately, this pronounced disparity is explained by the fact that, in
several key toss-up Senate races, [Republicans are running weak
candidates]{.underline} whose extreme positions, lack of experience or
personal embattlements make them far more vulnerable in a statewide race
than a more mainstream Republican would be.

[In the race for Pennsylvania's open Senate seat]{.underline}, which is
being vacated by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, [the progressive
Democrat]{.underline} [[John
Fetterman]{.underline}](https://thehill.com/people/john-fetterman/)
[leads]{.underline} Trump-ally and television doctor [Mehmet
Oz](https://thehill.com/people/mehmet-oz/) in every general election
[poll](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/)
conducted thus far, and FiveThirtyEight's [forecast
model](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/)
gives Fetterman an advantage.

During a red-wave election year in a purple state like Pennsylvania, one
would expect a progressive candidate like Fetterman to fare much worse
than his Republican opponent, especially in an open-seat race. However,
Oz has a very high negative rating coming out of the primary because of
opponent David McCormick's effective
[attacks](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/06/politics/dr-oz-mccormick-turkey-pennsylvania-senate/index.html),
and has few, if any, ties to Pennsylvania.

[In Georgia, the GOP is also running a celebrity Senate nominee with no
experience]{.underline}, who seems to be even less viable as a general
election candidate than Oz, notwithstanding the fact that Georgia leans
further right politically than Pennsylvania.

Former NFL star [Herschel
Walker,](https://thehill.com/people/herschel-walker/) [Trump's
handpicked nominee]{.underline}, has been embattled in a number of
problematic personal scandals, including the [discovery of three
children](https://www.thedailybeast.com/herschel-walker-lied-about-his-secret-kids-to-his-own-campaign)
he told staff he did not have and [lying about working in law
enforcement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/14/herschel-walker-false-claims-senate-georgia/).
Walker also openly [espouses conspiracy theories surrounding the [2020
election](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/28/politics/fact-check-herschel-walker-2020-election-january-6/index.html),
[COVID-19](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/hershel-walker-covid-mist-resurfaced-interview-1283585/)
and
[evolution](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/16/1086898518/georgia-gop-senate-candidate-herschel-walker-questions-evolution).]{.underline}

As a result, Walker is
[underperforming](https://www.ajc.com/politics/why-kemp-warnock-voters-could-factor-into-2022-race/F2WY5K3PABHL5IHYPXFNBZ72NE/)
Georgia's G.O.P. gubernatorial nominee Brian Kemp by roughly four points
in public polling. [Though Georgia is one of the redder swing states,
both FiveThirtyEight and The Cook Political Report rate Walker's race
against incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock as a
[toss-up](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/).]{.underline}

[In Arizona]{.underline}, another purple state, [Trump-backed venture
capitalist]{.underline} [[Blake
Masters]{.underline}](https://thehill.com/people/blake-masters/) [will
likely be the Republican candidate]{.underline} facing incumbent
Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, who FiveThirtyEight gives a [slight
edge](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/)
in their forecast.

[Masters is one of the most politically extreme GOP Senate]{.underline}
candidates in a swing state. [He is a staunch [proponent of far-right
conspiracy
theories](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/27/blake-masters-thiel-arizona-senate-profile-00034781)]{.underline},
including Trump's 'Big Lie' about the 2020 election and the
anti-immigrant Great Replacement Theory. [He is also [anti-gay
marriage](https://www.thedailybeast.com/arizona-senate-candidate-blake-masters-views-on-gay-marriage-may-surprise-his-political-master-peter-thiel),
anti-abortion and anti-American aid to Ukraine]{.underline}, placing him
well out of the mainstream.

In Nevada, Republican [Adam
Laxalt,](https://thehill.com/people/adam-laxalt/) former state attorney
general, is running against Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto.
While [Laxalt supports Trump and largely [embraces the right's 2020
election
lies](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/big-lie-looms-tuesdays-primaries-nevada-south-carolina/story?id=85315187)]{.underline},
he is an experienced politician who is considered somewhat more
mainstream within his own party compared to Oz, Walker and Masters.

The result of this
[toss-up](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/)
Senate race --- between an establishment Democratic incumbent and an
experienced Republican --- will arguably be more indicative of
Democrats' overall midterm performance than the races in Pennsylvania,
Georgia and Arizona. Indeed, a Cortez-Masto victory could signal
pared-down House and state-level losses for Democrats this year.

To be sure, Democrats are by no means a shoo-in to win any of these
races --- or control of the Senate --- in November. However, [the
G.O.P.'s failure to nominate more moderate and palatable candidates in
these key statewide races is giving Democrats a reasonable chance of
retaining their slim Senate majority, even in a red-wave election
year.]{.underline}

On the other hand, the fact that these Senate races are rated as
toss-ups --- even with Republicans running fringe candidates --- is
indicative of how favorable the national political climate is for the
G.O.P.

And to be sure, if 2022 ends up being a red-wave election like 1994 or
2010, the weakness of individual GOP candidates will be less important
than the overall pro-Republican tide.

In that same vein, the [Biden](https://thehill.com/people/biden/)
administration's policies on the border and immigration could end up
badly hurting both Cortez-Masto and Kelly, notwithstanding the
individual positions these candidates might well take.

If Democratic candidates in these swing-state Senate races --- and
national Democrats as a whole --- aren't able to effectively sell
themselves as a reasonable and moderate alternative to extreme
Republicans, President Biden and his party will face several trying
years in opposition in both the House and Senate.

### GOP win

JY).

Recently there has been a spate of stories about Republicans'
difficulties in taking over the Senate. These analyses typically focus
on candidates' poor polling numbers in key states and the weakness of
the Republican recruiting class.

These aren't absurd analyses; I've referred to the battle between the
overall electoral environment and Republican candidate quality as "the
irresistible force versus the immovable object" in previous columns. Had
the Republican Party fielded its A-team in states like Georgia,
Pennsylvania and Arizona, we probably would not be talking about
Democrats even having a shot at retaining the Senate.

At the same time, we shouldn't get carried away. While [Republican
candidate quality is an issue, good analysis should not lose sight of
the fact that environment matters as well]{.underline}, and probably
more so these days. President Joe Biden's job approval is 37.7% in the
RealClearPolitics Average, a mark reached only briefly by former
President Donald Trump in August and December of 2017, and never touched
by former President Barack Obama. While the [map isn't as favorable for
Republicans as it will be in 2024, it isn't unfavorable,
either.]{.underline}

To see this best, let's consider the races on an individual basis.
[Republicans need to net just one seat to win control of the
Senate]{.underline}. Right now, Democrats have two realistic targets:
Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. (Others, like Missouri and North Carolina,
probably only come into play if the environment shifts in a dramatically
favorable way for Democrats.) In Wisconsin, incumbent Senator Ron
Johnson is a poor fit for the state ideologically. In Pennsylvania,
[Republicans nominated Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is most famous for dispensing
sometimes-questionable medical advice on the Oprah Winfrey show, and who
resides in a multi-million dollar home in New Jersey]{.underline}. This
is compounded by the fact that Democrats have nominated Lt. Gov. John
Fetterman, who doesn't code as an East Coast progressive and who may be
able to peel off working class voters in the state. Also, if we are
being honest, Oz's dual Turkish citizenship is unlikely to help him
here.

But let's also be honest about the daunting nature of the task facing
Democrats. Both [Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have been, on average, two
points more Republican than the country as a whole in presidential
elections]{.underline}. As elections analyst Harry Enten has pointed
out, since 1982 the president's party has defeated one incumbent senator
in 87 attempts in such races (GOP Sen. Lauch Faircloth lost in 1998).
But in that election, President Bill Clinton's disapproval was roughly
where President Biden's approval sits today. Maybe Johnson is a special
case, and there's always a chance he loses. But we should probably start
with a strong bias against it happening.

**Democrats are losing seats and ballots -- can't catch up.**

JY).

The president's party has performed better in open seats that lean
toward the opposition in presidential elections, but even then they are
just 3 for 35 in the past 40 years. Republicans won an open seat in
Minnesota in 2002, while Democrats won the Indiana Senate seat in 1998
and held the West Virginia Senate seat in 2010. But these three pickups
all involved some combination of strange circumstances (the death of
Sen. Paul Wellstone shortly before the election in 2002), an extremely
popular president (1998 and 2002), or unusually strong candidates for
the opposition (Evan Bayh, Joe Manchin, and, arguably, Norm Coleman). We
might posit that Fetterman qualifies as an unusually strong candidate,
but that remains to be seen; his endorsement of Bernie Sanders and his
health issues are potential minefields for him to navigate.

In any event[, it isn't impossible for Democrats to flip one of these
seats. It would just be unusual, especially with a president whose job
approval sits in the 30s, and we should treat the possibility as
such.]{.underline}

[Democrats then have the task of defending three clearly vulnerable
seats.]{.underline} Another one, in [New Hampshire, is in some jeopardy,
but probably doesn't fall unless at least two of the other three seats
also flip]{.underline} (Colorado and, to a much lesser degree,
[Washington State, could also come into play in the fal]{.underline}l,
but are unlikely to do so unless the previous seats are lost). Two of
these states -- [Arizona and Georgia]{.underline} -- have PVIs (Partisan
Voter Index, which measures how each district or state performs at the
presidential level compared to the nation as a whole) that [lean toward
Republicans]{.underline}, while a third (Nevada) has no lean in either
direction. The president's job approval in these states likely mirrors
his national job approval; this means that a [successful Democratic
candidate is going to have to convince about one in six voters who don't
approve of the president to nevertheless pull the lever for the
Democratic Senate candidate.]{.underline}

That's a tall order, especially in [Nevada, where Republicans have a
reasonably good, if not spectacular,]{.underline} candidate in former
Attorney General Adam Laxalt. Laxalt hails from a famous Nevada family,
and is a capable enough politician that he lost the gubernatorial race
by just four points in the solid Democratic year of 2018. [He's a
candidate that is at least at the Mendoza line in an environment where
Mendoza-line candidates should win.]{.underline}

**Democrats need to win at least three more seats**

[That leaves Georgia and Arizona]{.underline}. Former Heisman Trophy
winner Herschel Walker is a weak candidate with a penchant for
outlandish comments, and Sen. Raphael Warnock is a charismatic
incumbent. But this is still a seat that Warnock barely won against
another weak candidate in a low turnout 2020 runoff, and he will have to
convince a large number of voters who disapprove of the president to
vote for him. Arizona is an under-polled race with a late primary. We
don't yet know what kind of candidate Blake Masters, the seemingly
likely victor of the GOP primary, is going to be, although recent
comments about the possibility that the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol was
an FBI false flag operation aren't particularly promising. But again,
[all he has to do to win is convince about 80% of the Arizona voters who
disapprove of President Biden to vote for him.]{.underline}

In short, the battle for the [Senate comes down to Democrats' ability to
win at least three of four seats that would likely be highly competitive
if President Biden's job approval were about ten points higher than it
is today.]{.underline} But in a situation where Senate outcomes
correlate heavily with presidential job approval in the state, that's a
tough row to hoe. While we should give more than a cursory nod to the
possibility that Democrats will hold the Senate (unlike the possibility
that Democrats will hold the House, which is barely worth that nod), we
should also [say with]{.underline} some [confidence that Republicans are
the favorites to win.]{.underline}

Probably the best counter-argument is that our high levels of
polarization insulate Democrats from Biden's job approval. In other
words, there are voters who may disapprove of the job the president is
doing, but will nevertheless vote Democratic. We saw this in 2008, where
Republican candidates ran far ahead of President Bush's job approval in
many states. Republican voters may have recognized the poor job he was
doing, but in the end, they were still Republicans.

There's no doubt that we've reached that point, as most Democratic
Senate candidates are running ahead of Biden's job approval right now.
We've become much more polarized since 2008, and Democratic candidates
in these states probably have a higher floor than we might have seen 10
years ago. But this is a two-way street; [Republican candidate quality
won't matter as much as it might have a decade ago either.]{.underline}

### No Link - FoPo

#### Foreign policy doesn't matter in midterms, no soldiers invested

As the situation on the Russian-Ukrainian border intensifies, I wonder
how many people like me are checking the news several times an hour,
wondering whether Russia has finally attacked its smaller neighbor. Of
course, no one can know where this is headed, how long it will dominate
the news, what role the U.S. and its NATO allies will play, or what
sanctions will be levied on Russia. We know what kind of shape President
Biden and his party were in going into this crisis (pretty bad); we just
can't know how either will look coming out the other end. In the last
several months, Biden's job-approval numbers have mostly stabilized,
largely fluctuating between 40 and 44 percent in the
[*RealClearPolitics*](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president-biden-job-approval-7320.html)
and
[*FiveThirtyEight*](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/?cid=rrpromo)
poll averages. The [Gallup
Organization](https://news.gallup.com/poll/329384/presidential-approval-ratings-joe-biden.aspx.)
released its monthly polling covering the first half of February,
putting Biden's approval rating at 41 percent, a point above his 40
percent in January. That's 2 points better than Donald Trump's 39
percent at this point, but 9 points below Barack Obama's 50 percent and
12 points below Bill Clinton's. In the final Gallup poll before their
first midterm elections, Trump had a 43 percent approval rating
(resulting in a net loss of 40 House seats), Obama was at 45 percent
approval (losing 52 seats), and Clinton at 46 percent (losing 64 seats).
We can put George W. Bush's numbers to the side, given their
stratospheric increase after 9/11. But his stood at 62 percent at this
stage and 63 percent going into the 2002 midterms, en route to
Republicans gaining eight seats in the House. Biden's 41 percent overall
approval rating in Gallup was bracketed by a [47 percent approval on
handling the
coronavirus](https://news.gallup.com/poll/390086/biden-ratings-economy-foreign-affairs-russia-near.aspx),
36 percent on handling "the situation with Russia," 37 percent on the
economy, and 40 percent for foreign policy. Given how monolithic
partisans are in their approval ratings and actual voting, it is always
useful to look only at independents, the 'jump ball' Americans. Biden's
overall rating among them was 35 percent (5 points below his approval
among all adults). His best marks were on dealing with the coronavirus
(45 percent approval), followed by foreign policy (37 percent), Russia
(35 percent), and the economy (30 percent). It is pretty clear [the
president and his administration's denial of the threat of inflation and
slow reaction to it was exceedingly damaging to him.]{.underline} (While
we are on the subject, it is fascinating to see Senate Democrats, after
so passionately advocating for more infrastructure spending this past
year, propose suspending the gasoline tax for the rest of the year, no
matter that the gas tax is the primary regular funding source for
transportation infrastructure. Panic is never pretty.) While we don't
know the trajectory that the Russia/Ukraine crisis will take, and there
are [many factors that can impact on midterm
elections](https://www.vox.com/22899204/midterm-elections-president-biden-thermostatic-opinion),
we do know that [in the absence of a large number of U.S. military
deaths, Americans rarely vote on foreign-policy issues, particularly in
midterms. The state and direction of the economy, particularly [change
in real disposable personal
income](https://www.mischiefsoffaction.com/post/2022-midterm-forecast),
is far more determinative.]{.underline} Turnout and the relative levels
of enthusiasm between the two parties' bases is key. There was a big gap
heading into the 2018 midterm elections with, as usual, the party out of
power much more motivated going into the fall of that year---though the
Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination did a lot to close the gap in
predominantly rural areas, which helped Republicans actually score a net
gain in the Senate while getting hosed (a political science term) in the
House. Right now, Democrats are the party suffering from a lack of
motivation among their base. [If someone wanting a read on a midterm is
only going to watch two things, it should be a president's approval
rating and the [generic congressional ballot
test](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/forecasting-the-2022-midterm-election-with-the-generic-ballot/)]{.underline},
both pretty good barometers of which way the wind is blowing and whether
it's light, moderate, or heavy. In my view, Biden and his team are
handling this incredibly challenging crisis far better than many other
things over the last year. But this is unlikely to save Democrats from
what is increasingly looking to be a pretty horrible midterm election.

**QUESTION:** Thank you so much and good morning. I'm Pearl Matibe with
Power FM 98.7. Coverage is generally the continent of Africa. My
question is for both professors. So, Professor Hughes, please, can you
just help me understand -- I understand that the employment numbers seem
to be good, that the fact that all these jobs that had been lost with
the closures due to COVID-19, that 97 percent number seems pretty good.
So can you help me make the connection: What, then, explains the fact
that we're having issues with the economy? What is that stemming from?
What is the root causes, I guess, is what I really want to understand?
If people are back to work producing and doing what they were doing
pre-COVID, why do we have this problem now? So please help me understand
that, and it would be nice if you can explain what impact does that have
for the rest of the world, bearing the fact that we are foreign
journalists, so we want to understand the link of what impact this has
on the rest of the world, particularly perhaps places like Africa. For
Professor Baker, my question to you would be: Given what is -- what we
think might happen for these midterm elections, how different are these
from the past midterm election? So I'd like to understand the comparison
between the one during the Trump administration versus the Biden
administration. And then, if you do have data or whatever on these
battleground states, maybe if you could pass that on to the Foreign
Press Center, they can maybe send that to us. I'd like to understand
which states those are so that that can help me, for example, track
that. What I'd like to understand as well is what then does this have an
impact to other countries given the fact that United States has this
narrative of being a global leadership? So what impact, if any, will the
midterm elections have? What should the rest of the world be expecting
as maybe a boomerang effect or something of that nature? So I'd like to
understand those linkages, please. Thank you. **MR HUGHES:** Well, let
me start on the economy. Basically, the labor markets are strong.
Consumers currently are in good financial shape. One metric of that is
they have \$18.5 trillion -- \$18.5 trillion basically in savings --
money market accounts, savings accounts, checking accounts, and the
like. That is \$5 trillion higher than it was before the pandemic began
in February of 2020. And they also have low debt levels and the like.
And so part of the reason for that was the federal relief checks that
they received during the pandemic and the economic downturn. However,
looking forward, even though they are in reasonably good shape right
now, they see real problems ahead. When gasoline per gallon in the
United States is over \$5 a gallon, a dramatic increase from where it
was a year ago, they are very unhappy, and that gives them a negative
perception of the future. The same thing with food and groceries and the
like where prices have been soaring. And some of this stems obviously
from the supply chain issues that emerged during the pandemic, pushed up
the prices of various commodities and the like, and that's reflected in
a number of other segments, certainly, of the economy. So there's also
concerns -- I'm not sure exactly how to weigh these in -- that we have
sort of a challenge to globalization in that maybe the world economy is
deglobalizing, and that does not bode well for prices of many goods and
the like. There's also unease in terms of the war in Ukraine. And there
may well be a sense that things are out of control. So they're okay
today, but boy, we have -- there are storm clouds on the horizon, there
are issues on the horizon. Now, one of the things that's going to --
that is impacting many parts of the world are the actions of the Federal
Reserve. In order to combat inflation, they have pushed up interest
rates. In historical terms, they're not that high yet, but compared to
the ultra-low interest rates of 2018, 2019, and 2020, they are exploding
upwards. Now, this is strengthening the dollar. Its -- the strengthening
dollar hurts many developing nations, the value of their currency. The
value of the euro in Europe against the dollar has plummeted and the
like. So high U.S. interest rates do not bode well for the global -- for
much of the global economy. And if demand diminishes in the United
States, if there is a recession, that's going to impact consumers
purchasing foreign (inaudible) as the year proceeds. Again, the election
technically is three and a half months away. We'll be getting a series
of economic metrics. We'll have a series of federal month -- actions
taking place in each of the months to come. So again, there's highly
uncertain economic conditions around the election time. **MODERATOR:**
Professor Baker, over to you. **MR BAKER:** Yes. I guess as a general
rule, [foreign policy issues don't play a very large role in American
midterm elections or even in presidential elections unless the United
States happens to be at war.]{.underline} The most recent example, of
course, is 2002, when President George W. Bush defied historical trends
of midterm elections going against the president's party in which the
Republicans made modest gains in the House and Senate. The -- clearly,
in this -- in the 2022 midterm elections, [foreign policy issues are not
very high on the agenda]{.underline} unless you define things like
energy prices as foreign policy issues, and clearly, the price of energy
in the United States has been profoundly affected by the war in Ukraine
and the sanctions that have been taken against Russia. But really,
[energy prices are seen more or less as an economic issue rather than as
a foreign policy issue]{.underline}. And interestingly enough, Ukraine,
[the war in Ukraine, the attack by Russia on Ukraine, has not figured
very prominently in the run-up to the 2022 election, largely because
American troops are not directly involved]{.underline} in the
hostilities even though we are providing very, very significant military
assistance to Ukraine. There are -- clearly, there are other things
going on in the world. For example, in terms of Africa and the advent of
monkeypox as a health risk in the United States, which is being treated
as a sexually transmitted disease in the United States. There's a
problem in terms of the availability of vaccine to inoculate people
against monkeypox. We did have stocks of that in the United States, but
there have again been problems with supplying it in the quantities that
are needed. So barring some other event -- I mean, there are kind of
background factors certainly involving international relations and
foreign policy. The evacuation, hasty evacuation of American forces from
Afghanistan, which President Biden pledged that he would do based upon
the belief that the Afghan Government could hold out for a period of
time, the very quick collapse of the Ghani regime was very much a blot
on President Biden's foreign policy ledger. But that took place quite a
while ago, and has been superseded by other concerns and other problems
which the President may have to deal with, most conspicuously domestic
inflation. **MODERATOR:** Thank you, professors, for that response. I'll
turn it over to Alex. Alex, please state your whole name and your media
outlet and ask your question. Thank you.
