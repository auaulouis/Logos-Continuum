#### The aff describes the opposition in tacitly gendered terms; the aff is inherently enforcing hegemonic masculinity

Kennan was only one of [[many U.S. officials]{.mark} [who depicted the
allies as partially incapacitated and needing direction]{.mark}, not
just because the Europeans\' military and economic power could not match
America\'s but also because their rationality, health, or masculinity
seemed in some way impaired. In many episodes of the Cold War, [American
officials juxtaposed images of the allies as effeminate, effete, or
otherwise lacking in robust masculinity, with depictions of the Soviets
as aggressively hypermasculine]{.mark}. Representing the danger as one
of seduction and/or rape, U.S. officials expressed and reinforced
gendered conceptions that naturalized America\'s predominance in the
alliance.]{.underline} For example, at the 1954 Berlin Conference,
Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov made an appeal to French
Foreign Minister Georges Bidault. Molotov argued that on the basis of
Russia\'s and France\'s common trauma from German militarism in the
world wars, the two nations should oppose the rebirth of the German
military under the guise of the proposed European Defense Community.
Moscow and Paris had much to cooperate about, Molotov stressed, and
their \"difference in social systems need not serve as \[a\] barrier
between them.\" Recording this appeal, C. D. Jackson, a special
assistant to President Dwight Eisenhower, wrote that Molotov
\"practically wooed Bidault in public.\" Jackson \"slipped\" Assistant
Secretary of State for European Affairs Livingston Merchant \"a note
saying \'I didn\'t think he would get his hand above Bidault\'s knee so
soon.\' \" Jackson added that \"Merchant laughed and left the note in
front of him where it was solemnly read by JFD\[ulles\] a while later.
He turned around and winked.\"\" We get an insight into the power
dynamics encoded in Jackson\'s language when we consider the effect of
hypothetically switching the positions assigned to Bidault and to
Dulles. [If the Soviet minister had been appealing to U.S. interests, it
would have seemed strange --- and highly transgressive --- for Jackson
to represent that move as Molotov placing his hand above Dulles\'s knee.
Yet Jackson\'s discourse assumed that taking liberties with the French
was to be expected: the mock surprise was that Molotov would \"get\" to
an intimate part of Bidault\'s body \"so soon.\" A key point here is
that Jackson\'s sexualizing of this political episode both drew on
preexisting gendered stereotypes about French susceptibility and
reinforced those stereotypes. Jackson\'s cheerful obscenity made the
vulnerability and subordination of France seem natural and inevitable,
grounded in the body and in emotion. Although it is unclear rrom the
text, and perhaps was unclear to Jackson, whether Molotov\'s advance was
to be coded as heterosexual or homosexual, in either case the French
leader was positioned by jackson\'s discourse as passive and open to
penetration.]{.underline} Merchant\'s laugh and Dulles\'s wink signaled
that they got the point of Jackson\'s analogy. Moreover, [the laugh and
the wink marked a brief abatement in the formality and tension of the
conference, a moment when the boys, including the usually straitlaced
Dulles, bonded together on the basis of reinscribing the familia partly
raping, partly seducing Soviets and the vulnerable French.]{.underline}

I should note that while the juxtaposition of Soviet power weakness
suggested the metaphor of sexual overmastering, a com rape and
seduction, another section of this document coded differently. In
praising a speech in which Bidault had endorsed A on Germany and on the
EDC, Jackson depicted him as \"a hero\" Jackson\'s language
demonstrated[[, the governing logic or pattern metaphors is not that a
person, nation, or policy is always masculine or feminine. Rather,
writers or speakers generally code as masculine they understand to be
positive, and they generally code as feminine they understand to be
negative]{.mark}. In the context of the Atlantic alli policies, actions,
or statements are generally those with which t agrees. [An action by
Bidault in accordance with U.S. purpos perceived them, was a masculine
action, requiring \"guts\" and ev the other hand, an action suggesting
that the French]{.mark} [were incli Soviet policy --- or acting
independently --- was somewhat parad as an effeminate
non-action]{.mark}, a position of passive]{.underline}, sexualized
Molotov had his hand above Bidault\'s knee. Through this con ments of
rape and seduction in an overarching metaphor, Bidault agency and
knowledge: He is both overpowered and duped.

This gendered interpretation of Bidault\'s interaction with Mo pattern
in which U.S. officials represented France\'s resistanc policy as
evidence that Fourth Republic France suffered from me from an
insufficiency of masculinity, and from a moral corruptio and society. In
order to explore how these categories of deficienc and reinforced one
another, we need first to discuss the operati oppositions in the
language of foreign policymakers and analyst [It is common Western usage
of language to construct meaning izing things in terms of pairs that
require one item to be not just dis negation of the other. In other
words, [we tend to organize and according to what they are not or to
what they are opposed]{.mark}. The most basic binary opposition is
between the self and the rest of the world: There is me and not-me and,
by an easy extension, us and not-us.]{.underline} In the case of the
very different or alien, there is same and the other. [When the French
resisted American aims for the Atlantic alliance, U.S. officials often
reacted with emotive language that drew much of its force from such
binary oppositions]{.underline} as self/other, we/them, healthy/sick,
sane/crazy, masculine/feminine, rational/emotional, logical/illogical,
moral/cor rupt, disciplined /uncontrolled, sound / foolish, civic /
selfish, trustworthy/unreli able, good/wicked, active/passive,
objective/subjective

[These binary oppositions help shape meaning, both in discussions of
foreign policy and in more general discourse. The first term in each
binary set is more highly valued by society, usually by both women and
men. Because the terms in each of the pairs are mutually exclusive,
binaries help accentuate differences, thereby underplaying the
possibility of an intermediate position between the opposites. For
example, if descriptive language codes French policy as a manifestation
of sickness and codes American policy as a manifestation of health, such
language undermines the view that each policy is the expression of
legitimate, though different, national interests. The organization of
these binaries encourages people to assume linkages and spillovers
within the set of positive terms - such as self, healthy, sane, sound,
rational, logical, objective, and masculine from the above list --- and
comparable links within the set of negative terms, such as other, sick,
crazy, foolish, emotional, illogical, subjective, and
feminine]{.underline}.1\'

[Because [people conventionally assume that the differences between
masculine and feminine are basic and natural, spoken or written language
often maps these perceived differences onto other oppositions, such as
rational/emotional and objective/subjective.]{.mark} Since at least the
time of Aristotle, both men have commonly - though not universally -
[assumed that men were more rational and objective and that women by
nature susceptible to illness and folly]{.mark}.]{.underline}\'4 nd
folly.\'4 [It is important to note that when I use \"masculine\" or
\"feminine\" I am not talking about the behavior of sp men and women but
rather the conventional, hegemonic view of m and femininity that tells
us how men and women should, and supp behave.]{.underline} Although
powerful, discourses about the masculine and the do not necessarily
correspond to the behavior of actual people; furth woman may act or talk
\"like a man,\" and a man may act or talk "like a woman"

### Great Power War Link

#### Aff positions great powers as a dangerous alien threat, which perpetuates neo-realist method that deems all violence acceptable as long as large nations are in harmony. Focus is on escalation rather than prevention. Turns case, aff thinks of other nations as enemies first --- root cause of all violence. Alt solves --- feminist conflict resolution rejects war as a means for peace.

"FEMINIST FOREIGN POLICY: A FINE LINE BETWEEN "ADDING WOMEN" AND
PURSUING A FEMINIST AGENDA", 2019, Journal of International Affairs
Vol.72 No.2 Spring/Summer, <https://www.jstor.org/stable/26760832>, pd)

The proliferation of feminist foreign policies has become a sign of
commitment to another world order. Governments that adopt such action
envision a world where women's rights are equally important to those of
men. They commit to empowering women and ensuring their meaningful
participation across various issues. Such commitments, therefore, are
understood as the objectives of a feminist foreign policy. This article
explains that, while a commitment to women's rights is important, [[the
current]{.mark} practices of purportedly [feminist foreign policies do
not reflect an authentically feminist approach]{.mark}]{.underline}. We
look into the theoretical background of feminist analysis in
international relations, propose criteria for a feminist foreign policy
based on feminist theory, and use these criteria to analyze and conduct
gap analysis of existing feminist foreign policies. Overall, this study
helps unpack the definition of feminist foreign policy and highlight
areas that can be addressed by those willing to commit to redefining
security and peace in the current world order. The [state of the current
[world order depends on the lens through which one looks at]{.mark}
[it]{.mark}]{.underline}. While some suggest that gender considerations
are starting to play a bigger role in international relations, others
claim that gender analysis continues to be ignored and even pushed back
against.1,2,3 While politicians paint either one of these pictures,
there is a general consensus about the situation on the ground: In many
places, the [principles of democracy and multilateralism are being
questioned, the rights of women, queer, indigenous, and rural groups,
among others, are threatened]{.underline}, and conflicts are becoming
more complex and are extending beyond the borders of states and regions.
Mostly, the current world system still operates in a neo-realist way, in
which [[states try to operate according to the principle of sovereignty
and competition for world power]{.underline}]{.mark}.4 As the recent
2019 Munich Security Conference demonstrated, the [worldwide [increase
of military and defense budgets, especially in the United States, China,
and Russia, and the growing tensions between these states, indicate the
rising competition for power]{.mark}.5]{.underline} [At such
conferences, the idea of incorporating gender analysis or some feminist
principles is artificial]{.underline}. Fortunately, there are a number
of states that care to some degree about the principle of "We The
People" enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the
way social groups and members of the international community fit into
the current world order. The last few years have also shown that the
number of such states is increasing, supposedly in response to the
ongoing failure of the "superpowers" to address violence and crises of
their own making. At the same time, states that were peripheral to the
establishment of the United Nations now act as megaphones of
multilateralism, promoting the ethical norm of equal treatment among
states and empowering each other in the process.6 One example of this is
the multilateral action to adopt the Treaty on the Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons in 2017, in which states have united not around the
principle of power but on the principle of opposing the security scheme
that has not been working for everyone. The process showed the nine
countries that possess nuclear weapons, and think of themselves as the
world's superpowers, that there is another means to security, one based
on the principles of multilateralism, common morality, human rights, and
extraterritorial accountability.7 In some scholarship, states that
promote human rights and multilateralism are known as "good states."8
Good states are those that use foreign policies to improve global
justice beyond their borders and transform global politics through the
pursuit of good international citizenship, which requires sensitivity to
the needs and wants of "others." The states that take on a similar view
on global politics and their responsibility on the global scale rely on
an alternative vision of global politics, looking at the drivers of
conflict and the root causes of violence in communities, societies, and
institutions. Feminist analysis represents another component of an
alternative view on global politics, not an idealistic departure from
it. This analysis provides a welldefined and augmented alternative to
the neo-realistic framework. All three of the 2015 United Nations
Reviews have admitted that the [[absence of gender analysis is a key
challenge for peace]{.mark}.]{.underline}9 [Feminist foreign policy is
one that includes whole populations, appreciates diversity, inspires
comprehensive analysis, and leaves no one behind.]{.underline} This
article explains that striving toward a feminist foreign policy and
having one are not the same. We look into the theoretical background of
feminist analysis in international relations, propose criteria for a new
understanding of feminist foreign policy, and apply these criteria to
analyze and conduct a gap analysis of existing feminist foreign
policies. Overall, this study helps unpack the definition of feminist
foreign policy and highlight areas that can be addressed by those
willing to redefine security and peace in the current world order.
Theoretical Background: What is a Feminist Foreighn Policy? Traditional
international relations theory defines foreign policy as both the
relationships between states and the structural organization of a
government and its foreign affairs.10 [Currently, [states'
relationship]{.mark}s and governing systems [are structured through a
neo-realist method]{.mark}: These [relationships and systems are
organized hierarchically and situated within a security dilemma]{.mark};
[they serve national interests; and]{.mark} they [are based on the
principle of sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}.11 With a few exceptions,
the [[top ranks of these hierarchies are occupied by men and]{.mark}
generally [dominated by masculine principles.]{.mark} This is often
overlooked because "gender is difficult to see when only the masculine
is present]{.underline}."12 This represents what is referred to as
"patriarchy." Feminist Critique Of Traditional Approaches To Security
Patriarchal systems and practices in foreign policy are highly
criticized by feminist international relations theory.13 The
foundational basis of this theory is that "gender is an integral, not an
accidental, feature of the worldwide structure of diplomatic, military
and economic relations."14 As Acker claims, [the [feminist method is not
about adding women into the system but revealing how the concept of
gender is incorporated into it]{.mark}.]{.underline}15 Such a method
shows that current principles of [foreign policy are highly dependent on
[gender norms, roles, and structures, and]{.mark} that all [institutions
are inherently gendered]{.mark}]{.underline}.16 Acker asserts that
gender in institutions could be understood in two ways: either as a
gender-neutral structure that tries to adjust women to the existing
systems of power and applies principles of representational gender
equality or as gender-integrated structures that apply equality and
justice within the structures, norms, and ruling ideology.17 Acker
agrees with the second understanding and claims that [[gender is an
integral part of all structure]{.mark}s]{.underline}.18 For us,
therefore, [a feminist foreign policy requires rethinking and
re-envisioning gender structures of institutions and governance
systems]{.underline}. It cannot be equivalent to a foreign policy that
merely aims to ensure equal representation or meaningful participation
of women in the position of power. Using Gender Analysis True, Tickner,
and Enloe deconstructed the main concepts of foreign policy and
international relations using gender analysis.19, 20, 21 They revealed
the [[gender bias of security, power, and sovereignty]{.mark}, claiming
that these [concepts are made by and for men]{.mark}]{.underline} on the
basis of their experiences.22 Hence, the concept of hegemonic
masculinity was established to describe gendered power distribution in
hierarchies. [[Hegemonic masculinity is understood
as]{.underline}]{.mark} a "culturally idealized form" of
[[power]{.mark}, mainstreamed in personal, collective, and institutional
spheres of life, and expressed [through hierarchy, violence, and
aggression]{.mark}.23 [Hegemonic masculinity expresses an unequal gender
structure]{.mark}, which should be challenged by integrating feminist
principles into national and foreign policy]{.underline}.24
Understanding Feminist Foreign Policy What does feminist foreign policy
look like? Indeed, there is no agreed upon definition of a feminist
foreign policy. What we have learned from feminist theory is that gender
parity and [attempts to make women visible in international relations
are not enough to realize a comprehensive feminist foreign
policy]{.underline}. Such an approach, according to Enloe, only implies
an attempt to embed women firmly inside a patriarchal system and fails
to challenge the underlying gender norms that fuel violence and
conflict.25 The claim that gender parity in foreign policy will also
bring about more peace and harmony in international relations is not as
effective as women's meaningful participation achieved through
structural change.26 The study by UN Women and Inclusive Peace and
Transition Initiative shows that, despite the fact that women's
inclusion improves opportunities for peace, [the number of women present
at the negotiating table does not assure a better outcome for
women]{.underline}: "it is the level of influence that women can assert
on the process that makes a difference, not only their presence by
numbers."27 In her book Bananas, Beaches, Bases, Enloe provides deep
insights into how women from diverse backgrounds play an important role
in international politics but are systematically excluded, ignored, and
often forgotten.28 When analyzing the qualities and characteristics
embodied by those in power, one will find a surprisingly homogenous
group of world leaders in economics and politics. However, it is also
the case that there exist female members of parliament who vote for
military conflict solutions or uphold the patriarchal militarized
system; they also serve as leaders of major military institutions.29
These are the manifestations of the traditional neo-realist security
system, and its comparatively easy application drives both women and men
into making decisions and setting their priorities.30 The feminist
approach to foreign policy is not as easy; it demands a shift in how
individuals within the system make political decisions and set
priorities. It is about advancing peace and development for everyone,
not through striving for the absence of conflict or serving the
interests of individuals within the government, but through reimagining
governance and social structures, as well as promoting nonviolent
conflict solutions. We propose that the guiding principles for a
feminist foreign policy framework should include intersectional analysis
and inclusion, complete disarmament, security concepts centered around
the wellbeing and safety of the individual, the inclusion of civil
society, the promotion of international solidarity through dialogue, and
the fostering of communities based on empathy. Indicators Of A Feminist
Foreign Policy The guiding principles of feminist foreign policy can be
practically visualized through the following set of indicators:
political dialogue, feminist political economy, individual safety and
wellbeing, empathic communities, inclusivity, and a gender analysis
based on intersectionality. The following section elaborates our
assumptions about what feminist foreign policy should look like based on
the feminist international relations theory. Political Dialogue
Political dialogue should be the basis of all aspects of foreign policy,
including diplomacy, trade, conflict prevention, and conflict
resolution. Unfortunately, practitioners in the field of international
relations continue to emphasize militarized or forced solutions to the
world's security problems and trade politics. Feminist scholars
criticize this approach and start their analysis with the question
"where are the women?" and end by highlighting the need for a shift of
the entire approach of security and militarism toward an inclusive
dialogue.31 [[Feminist conflict resolution approaches reject war as a
means to peace, viewing war as a result of institutionalized violence
and a battle for power over the counterpart]{.mark}.32 Feminist scholars
seek to [prevent]{.mark} violence and identify root causes of
conflict]{.underline}.33 Addressing the [[drivers of conflict instead of
superficially fighting the symptoms]{.mark}, such as physical
violence]{.underline}, differentiates military security from feminist
approaches focused on safety and wellbeing. [Feminist conflict
resolution starts with a gender analysis of power, the inclusion of
marginalized voices and local people through dialogue, and the
commitment to disarmament]{.underline}.34 Safety and Wellbeing In
traditional foreign policy approaches, security is given high priority.
Concepts such as [national or human security represent understandings of
governments on what to target or how to achieve security. Feminists have
criticized both concepts because these approaches ignore or overlook the
gendered dimension of security]{.underline}.35 [Feminist security
studies emphasize and elaborate the importance of [ask]{.mark}ing
[questions such as "security for who, by whom]{.mark}]{.underline}?"36
[It is the [question]{.mark}ing of [the militarized security that is not
able to protect women, children, civilians, migrants]{.mark}, among
others, [neither in times of conflict nor in times of
peace]{.mark}]{.underline}.37 Feminist security studies emphasize the
need to rethink traditional concepts of security. Putting the security
issues of all intersectional groups and individuals at the center of
security, [[the usefulness of the military industrial complex
will]{.mark} have to [be questioned]{.mark}.38 [Buying tanks or fighter
jets are not preventing children from dying of hunger, stopping
preventable diseases from spreading, or averting genderbased violence.
Instead, this form of security often perpetuates these
situations]{.mark}]{.underline}.39 In an ever-changing society featuring
dynamically evolving conflicts, Sylvester emphasizes that there is a
need to always review, reframe, and reflect on current approaches of
security and avoid the formulation of universal, timeless, and fixed
security concepts.40 [With this in mind, we refrain from unpacking the
concept of security, and we support feminist ideas of shifting the focus
from security toward the peace, safety, and wellbeing of the gendered
individual. Wellbeing, in this vein, includes physical safety in
addition to the social and political security of people and the
fulfillment of basic social needs.]{.underline} We argue that the way
problems are framed inherently influences the way solutions are found.
While defining security not through the absence of violence but through
the foundations of peace, world leaders can commit to peace through, for
example, renaming the United Nations Security Council into the United
Nations Peace Council. Feminist Foreign Policy demands shifting toward a
positive peace model and away from security. Empathic Communities The
third indicator we have identified is based on the building of empathic
communities. We differentiate between alliances based on military or
defense strategies and communities based on empathy and friendship.
[[Alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO)]{.mark},]{.underline} the Collective Security Treaty Organization
(CSTO), or even the current structure of the United Nations Security
Council (UNSC), [[serve the goal of engaging in alliances to advance
militarized security and national interests]{.mark}. These coalitions
further capitalize on the fundamental values of neo-realism in
international politics and represent the hegemonic security
model]{.underline}. [Because [these alliances always come with implicit
assumptions such as the presence of an enemy, a threat, and power
conflict, violent escalation often proves
inevitable]{.mark}]{.underline}. Feminism claims that there are more
reasons for building communities, which are not about military and
power, but rather about [common goals]{.underline} such as peace,
mutually beneficial trade agreements, or agreements on disarmament.
Those [can eventually build trust and dependencies so that attacks and
war would seem illogical.]{.underline} Communities such as the Group of
Friends of 1325, the Informal Expert Group on Women, Peace, and
Security, and Friends of Gender Parity are built on agreements that open
dialogue builds trust and empathy. Inclusion and Intersectional Approach
While there is not yet diverse and inclusive representation of the
heterogeneous society we live in, civil society groups, grassroots
organizations, and local organizations offer key forums through which
diverse experiences can be integrated in international relations.
Feminist foreign policy needs to identify these forums and include these
actors in policy making. This could be achieved through making space for
gender lobbyism, regularly hearing and consulting with civil society,
reaching out to grassroots and local organizations and refraining from
supporting traditional hierarchical structures through a reference to a
"bottom-up" approach, which is inherently hierarchical. Gender Analysis
Feminist methodology as the overarching umbrella of all indicators
represents a critical examination of power. Foreign policy and
international relations are an amphitheater for power relations, and
gender analysis represents a tool to change the script. Asking questions
such as "who is involved?," "why are certain decisions made?," "who is
affected?," and "who controls resources?" represents the shared practice
of feminist gender analysis, which aims to reveal underlying power
relations and to deconstruct the discrimination, silencing, and
marginalization of groups that do not fit existing gendered
identities.41 Gender analysis reveals what is behind social and
political norms and assists in providing alternative solutions.
Moreover, it elucidates the experiences of different groups of people,
which can help detect root causes of inequality as a starting point of
correcting discriminatory policies and laws.42 As discussed above, a
[gender analysis needs to be applied to existing security concepts,
military alliances, and militarism]{.underline}. Gender analysis is
crucial to understand why people lack access to resources, [why [some
communities are more prone to violence,]{.mark} or how policies affect
different groups of people]{.underline}. Gender analysis, hence, is a
basic tool and methodology for a feminist foreign policy. What Is
"Feminist" In Current Foreign Policies? A small number of countries have
already announced their adoption of feminist policies and programs
within their foreign policy frameworks. With the announcement of its
feminist foreign policy in 2014, Sweden is seen as the pioneer of
feminist foreign policy and a norm-setter on how gender matters in
international relations.43 Gender equality has also been featured
prominently in some parts of British foreign policy since 2009, and the
UK International Development (Gender Equality) Act adopted in 2014.44,45
Between 2011 and 2015, the Australian government also made a commitment
to global gender equality and women's empowerment as a core foreign
policy goal.46 Following these examples, Canada's government announced
its adoption of feminist international assistance policies.47 In
February 2016, Australia adopted a comprehensive foreign policy gender
strategy.48 Similarly, Norway adopted a gender strategy within its
foreign policy in October 2016.49 The latest addition to the list is
Germany, which promised to take the issue of women, peace, and security
seriously in its 2019-2020 tenure in the UN Security Council, and it has
important political leaders, including Stefan Liebich of Die Linke and
the Green Party, pushing for slightly varied definitions of a feminist
foreign policy.50,51 Many of these policies are focusing
disproportionately on the rights and experiences of women. If having a
focus on women's empowerment is what constitutes a feminist foreign
policy, then the United States qualifies, too. The State Department,
under Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, crafted a
collection of issue-specific foreign policies on various gender issues,
including the U.S. Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based
Violence Globally, the National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and
Security, and a Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls.52 Feminist
scholars and activists have many issues with calling any of the
above-mentioned policies "feminist." First, these policies are often
criticized for being inconsistent in the feminist approach to
international relations. Second, in many situations, gender
considerations are not being put at the center of all of the [foreign
policy]{.underline} decisions that these countries undertake. Lastly,
every single policy [from this list focuses disproportionately on the
situation of women, their rights, and needs, instead of addressing
gendered power structures]{.underline}, identifying silenced groups,
building empathic communities, and rethinking important concepts, such
as sovereignty, militarism, and nationalism. Sweden's "Handbook on
Feminist Foreign Policy," for example, defines a feminist foreign policy
as a transformative agenda that aims to change structures and enhance
the visibility of women and girls as actors."53 In theory, feminist
foreign policy should be about looking into the structures, addressing
gendered power relations, building gender inclusive institutions and
pursuing policies that incorporate the interests of and seek to benefit
all. Our analysis of the nature and implementation of existing feminist
foreign policies revealed the following key gaps, thus challenging the
"feminist" label given to them. The Political Economy Of War [The
[traditional approach to security supports]{.mark} the idea [that
international conflict is best solved through war and
violence]{.mark}]{.underline}.54 [One goal of feminist foreign policy
[should be]{.mark} to change this ideology and advance security [based
on individuals' wellbeing, disarmament, and political
dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline}. Militarism, Enloe claims, is both
ideology and worldview: having enemies is a natural situation, that
violence is a part of human nature, and that the masculine needs to
protect the feminine. [[The military and the military-industrial complex
are known to marginalize femininity]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is seen
as a weakness. In this vein, the military-industrial complex exists to
show the prevalence of some over others, to defeat what is seen as a
weakness by what is perceived as power. Therefore, by simply addressing
the situation of women, feminist foreign policies would not be able to
achieve what feminism stands for, which is re-envisioning security
through the understanding of power and the masculinity-femininity nexus.
However, it is well known that a [source of income for many governments
is]{.underline} its [arms trade and the mining of "conflict
minerals,]{.underline}" such as wolframite and cobalt.55 This list
includes the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada,
Sweden, and many others. [All of these [countries are engaged in the
political economy of war---the context in which the relationship between
production, labor, trade, law, policy, and the distribution of national
income are gender-blind and militarized]{.mark}]{.underline}.56 The
Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) conducted a
series of studies exposing the impact of arms transfers from Sweden and
the United Kingdom to Saudi Arabia on the lives of women in Yemen.57
Similarly, WILPF also exposed how the production and mining of minerals
by Canada, for example, clearly prioritizes systems of monetary profit
over citizens' human rights and governmental accountability.58 Women, in
this context, are negatively and disproportionally affected. For
example, gender-based violence in the mining industry is often
disproportionately connected to the socioeconomic conditions in which
women find themselves.59 Women are forced to work in the mines as cooks
and cleaners because of the absence of jobs available to them, and the
militarized atmosphere at mining sites often negatively impacts the way
women are treated. Therefore, [[countries]{.mark} that claim to be
pursuing feminist foreign policies are not making sincere efforts to
reimagine governance and security, instead [contribut]{.mark}ing [to the
escalation of violence and the promotion of a masculine military
ideology]{.mark}]{.underline}. One rare exception is the Government of
Costa Rica, which, while not having yet adopted a feminist foreign
policy framework, has made great strides in reallocating its entire
government defense budget to health and public services.60 In the
majority of countries, however, a feminist foreign policy becomes
nothing more than a label. The policies that states choose to roll out
cannot be separated from the lived and highly gendered experiences of
conflict, and from the new and often more complex and overlapping needs
that emerge as a result of that conflict. Heteronormativity And
Exclusion The concept of heteronormativity refers to the constructed
norm of heterosexuality in society, and the concomitant notion that
other gender identities are deviant or "abnormal."61 The problem lies in
the fact that a certain set of norms and rules determine the domination
of one gender over another, including deciding over identity groups and
having different rights and social recognition, a situation that highly
influences the way policymaking is carried out. Some of the gender
analysis toolkits across various fields assessed for this research are
based on the binary definition of gender.62 In this system, [lesbians,
gays, bisexuals, transgender, and queer identities have been excluded
from the political sphere through discrimination in law and in
practice]{.underline}.63 Laws exert significant control over sexuality,
marriage, and identity, and are also used to maintain the current
distribution of power in the international system. These social norms
are also reflected in institutions and organizations, the majority of
which are set up according to specific gender norms. Connell calls this
phenomenon "the gender regime of an institution" and claims that it
creates an enabling environment for exclusion.64 The complaint brought
in 2014 by W.H. v. Sweden at the European Court of Human Rights shows
how far the gendered regime of an institution can go. W.H., who applied
for asylum because she tried to escape a forced marriage in Iraq, was
determined as not having a plausible case for a refugee status in
Sweden. The Migration Board of Sweden noted that she would not lack a
"male network" to protect her in Iraq because her brother had also been
refused asylum in Sweden.65 The European Court has upheld Sweden's
decision to reject the applicant's application for asylum. This is but
one example of how institutions of law can be highly gendered. At the
same time, Germany, which has yet to develop a feminist foreign policy,
has demonstrated first steps towards challenging gender-blind governance
by, among other initiatives, opening a series of investigations into
gender-based violence crimes committed by ISIS against Yazidi women.66
In this regard, Belgium has also made great strides. The Belgian justice
system exercises what is known as "universal jurisprudence," allowing
its national courts to prosecute anyone who has committed genocide, war
crimes, or crimes against humanity anywhere in the world.67 Although
other countries have similar laws, Belgium's are particularly broad, and
its judges are unusually willing to use them.68 A feminist foreign
policy or a policy guided by a feminist approach should start with a
gender analysis that addresses gender norms, roles and relations through
the inclusion of marginalized voices and experiences into institutions
and sectors such as health, education, and security, among others.
Security [In the neorealist worldview, national security and
sovereignty, the protection of borders, and the control of trade
represent core security concerns. This security is often provided
through standby military defense mechanisms and migration laws. While
this concept seems to fail protecting people from violence and the
impact of wars, feminist scholars have raised questions concerning who
are the main beneficiaries of traditional security frameworks and what
groups are excluded.]{.underline}69 Having revealed the focus on
upholding sovereign power structures and state systems, feminist
security studies claim that to understand security, one needs to
understand power, which itself is gendered.70 Shepherd demands a shift
toward security for the individual, including stateless people and
migrants and the development of comprehensive positive models for peace
rather than security.71 Australia, one country that faces major gender
security issues related to border control and immigration detention, is
one example where the concept of security has yet to be transformed
through a foreign policy gender strategy. True argues that government
actors in Australia have interpreted the state's responsibility to
prevent violence and protect against gender-specific crimes, primarily
in relation to military, diplomatic, peace-building, and aid presences,
"outside" Australian borders in conflict-affected and post-conflict
states.72 They have not recognized the responsibility to include
non-citizens inside or outside Australian borders who have fled conflict
zones and gender-based oppression. In this context, Australia's National
Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security 2012-18, which focuses on
women's protection and prevention of sexual and gender-based violence,
does not have a mandate to incorporate the protection of women and their
dependents fleeing conflict zones or gender oppression and crossing
Australian borders as irregular migrants or asylum-seekers.73 At the
same time, Germany has made the safety of women and children refugees a
priority.74 There are various programs that help refugee women obtain
skills and employment, integrate within communities, and get necessary
support.75,76,77 Similarly, Jordan continues to demonstrate humanitarian
leadership in the Syrian refugee crisis, providing multi-sectoral
services that build women's resilience and empowerment in the support of
UN Women.78 In a feminist foreign policy, the wellbeing of a population
needs to be the biggest concern of a state. A [feminist method,
therefore, demands that the norms of [women's rights and international
law be strengthened and]{.mark} that the [focus be shifted from
escalation to prevention]{.mark}.]{.underline} This implies a conceptual
reorientation from a narrowly defined security policy to a comprehensive
gender-responsive policy. Sovereignty And Hierarchy [[The logic of
militarism, security, and hegemonic masculinity implies a closed
hierarchical organizational and social structure]{.underline}]{.mark}.
This structure distributes power to specific groups or individuals, with
others submitting to it.79 Hierarchy is only one out of many forms of
organization, but it is often presented as the most effective and
logical one. Former civilizations even called hierarchy the "holy
structure."80 Sovereignty, in this vein, is what sustains hierarchy. As
a term that came about with the Treaty of Westphalia and capitalized its
importance with the signing of the United Nations Charter, it is often
used as the ultimate claim to authority both domestically and
internationally.81 Hierarchy and the monopoly on authority are the core
characteristics of hegemonic masculinity.82 By maintaining the
principles of sovereignty, masculinity is upheld through multilateral
agreements such as the United Nations Charter and the creation of a
common identity referred to as nationalism.83 These principles further
maintain hierarchy. When we analyze the structure of the United Nations,
the hierarchical structure is clearly visible in the organization of the
United Nations Security Council, where the five permanent members have
the privilege of the veto and the nonpermanent members are
subordinate.84 Furthermore, the international peace model is oriented
around the hegemonic peace theory, in which a hegemon retains
disproportionate power over resources and armaments to deter conflict.85
However, there are several states that are willing to subject themselves
to international accountability to build partnerships for peace. The EU
Common Position on Arms Exports requires an export license to be denied
if, among other things, there is a clear risk that the equipment to be
exported might be used for violations of human rights or international
humanitarian law.86 This signals a very important attempt to commit to
protecting human rights and preventing sexual and genderbased violence
at the expense of potentially having their sovereignty subjected to
questioning.87 Overcoming hierarchical and sovereign structures requires
a commitment to be part of the collective process of determining how
governments can create a more sustainable and just world based on
empathy. Governments must be committed to a long-term vision, but they
must also be flexible with the initiatives they pursue, understanding
that all strategies will be subject to constant change as they strive
together for a more just world. Conclusion A comprehensive feminist
foreign policy remains a theoretical aspiration. In theory,
[[feminist]{.mark} foreign [policy aims to address gender power
structures and reframe]{.mark} traditional [concepts of security and
peace, sovereignty, sexuality, governance, and
nation-building]{.mark}.]{.underline} Despite criticism, [[feminism is
not a utopian concept]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is an alternative
explanation of the international system and guidance for how it can be
restructured to prevent a constant state of securitization and crisis. A
feminist foreign policy can build a peaceful international state system
based on community-building, inclusion, gender analysis, and political
dialogue. Feminism will stand on the margins of current foreign policy
debates for a long time if governments continue to pursue power by
traditional means and only attempt to embed women into the system rather
than adopting a comprehensive feminist policy. The current examples of
feminist foreign policies are often seen as gender binary, and the
concept of a feminist foreign policy is operationally misunderstood.
[The current implementation of feminist foreign policies is yet to
follow the feminist approach as it is seen by key academics in this
field. Such [policie]{.mark}s focus on putting more women in
decision-making positions and [bring]{.mark}ing [more support to women's
rights and needs, while leaving behind numerous intersectional groups of
people]{.mark}, references to whom are rarely included in foreign policy
due to its gendered nature]{.underline}. [At the same time, even women's
rights are not necessarily fully integrated into feminist foreign
policies because governments often differ in their understanding of
whose women's rights they are protecting. They are generally less
concerned about the impact of arms trade on women's rights or security,
as the government]{.underline} [may not be directly involved in the
conflict]{.underline}. In other cases, [[governments only worry about
women who are nationals of their state or women who are located outside
of the state, therefore once again leaving a large group of refugees,
stateless individuals, and migrants vulnerable to violence and
discrimination]{.underline}]{.mark}. For us, the feminist approach to
foreign policy demands a shift in how states make political decisions
and set priorities. It is about reaching for sustainable and inclusive
peace and development for everyone---not striving for the mere absence
of conflict but reimagining governance, especially social and
governmental structures. The following key indicators can serve as a
baseline for a feminist foreign policy: gender analysis; safety and
wellbeing; peaceful models of conduct through a political dialogue;
community-building based on empathy and common goals, and inclusive
policymaking by integrating intersectional approaches. Gender analysis
is required to respond to gender inequalities by addressing gender
norms, roles, and relationships, and to thereby drive reform of
governance and state institutions. Through partnerships, governments can
operationalize nonheteronormative visions of organization in foreign
policy. [[The current approach to feminist foreign policy]{.mark} [has
no capacity to challenge political economies of war, exclusion,
militarized security, sovereignty, and hierarchy]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The focus remains on increasing gender equality through representation,
leaving no commitment for structural change. In this way, the current
world order manages to deflect feminist challenges to the existing order
without altering the dominant neorealist structures. Without
changes---and, as we have shown, there are indications that some change
is underway---this [[approach threatens to make a]{.mark} feminist
approach [another short-term and artificial solution that is unlikely to
lift the world out of its current crisis.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Food Security Link (Long)

#### Women are the foundation of food security, patriarchal economics deny women their innovation towards agricultural biodiversity in their conquest to masculinize agriculture

**Shiva 09'** \[Vandana Shiva, Indian scholar, environmental activist,

[ ]{.underline}

[Agriculture,]{.underline} the growing of food[, is]{.underline} both
[the most important source of livelihood for]{.underline} the majority
of [the world people, especially women, as well as the sector related to
the most fundamental economic right, the right to food and nutrition.
Women were the world\'s original food producers,]{.underline} and they
continue to be cen- tral to food production system in the Third- World
countries in terms of the work they do in the food chain. [The worldwide
destruction of the feminine knowledge of agriculture evolved over four
to five thousand years, but a handful of **white male scientists** in
less than two decades have not merely **violated women as experts**;
but]{.underline} since their expertise in agriculture has been related
to modeling agriculture on nature\'s methods of renewablility[, its
destruction has also gone hand in hand with the ecological destruction
of nature\'s processes and the economic destruction of the poorer people
in rural areas. Agriculture has been evolved by women. Most farmers of
the world are women,]{.underline} and most girls are future farmers.
Girls learn the skills and knowledge of farming in the fields and
farms[. What is grown on farms determines whose livelihoods are secured,
what is eaten, how much is eaten, and by whom it is eaten. **Women make
the most significant contribution to food security**.]{.underline} They
produce more than half the world\'s food. They provide more than 80
percent of the food needs of food-insecure household and regions[.
**Food security is** therefore **directly linked to women\'s
food-producing capacity**. Constraints on women\'s capacity leads to
erosion of food security, especially for poor households in poor
regions.]{.underline} From field to kitchen, from seed to food, women\'s
strength is diversity. Women\'s capacities are eroded when this
diversity is eroded. Diversity is the pattern of women\'s work, the
pattern of women\'s planting and sowing of food crops and the pattern of
women\'s food processing[. The dominant systems of economics, science,
and technology have conspired against women and girls by conspiring
against diversity. Economics has rendered women\'s work as food
providers invisible because women provide for the household and perform
multiple tasks involving diverse skills.]{.underline} Women have
remained invisible as farmers in spite of their contribution to farming.
People fail to see the work that women do in agriculture.. Their produc-
tion tends not to be recorded by economists as \"work.\" And agriculture
as a future vocation for girls is thus closed. [These problems of data
collection on agricultural work arise not because too few women work but
**too many women do too much work**.]{.underline} There is a conceptual
inability of statisticians and researchers to define women\'s work
inside the house and outside the house (and farming is usually part of
both)[. This recognition of what is and is not labor is exacerbated both
by the great volume of work that women do and the fact that they do many
chores at the same time. It is also related to the fact that although
women work to sustain their families and communities, most of their work
is not measured in wages.]{.underline} Science and technology have
rendered women\'s knowledge and productivity invisible by ignoring the
dimension of diversity in agricultural production[. As the Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO) report on Women Feed the World men-
tions, women use more plant diversity, both cultivated and uncultivated,
than agri- cultural scientists know about. I]{.underline}n Nigerian home
gardens, women plant 18-57 plant species. In Sub-Saharan Africa women
cultivate as many as 120 different plants in the species left alongside
the cash crops managed by man. In Guatemala, home gardens of less than
0. 1 half acre have more than ten tree and crop species.4 In a single
African home garden more than 60 species of food-producing trees were
counted. In Thailand, researchers found 230 plant species in home
gardens. In Indian agriculture women use 150 different species of plants
for vegetables, and health care. In West Bengal 124 \"weed\" species
collected from rice fields have economic importance for farmers. In the
Expana region of Veracruz, Mexico, peasants utilize about 435 wild plant
and animal species of which 229 are eaten. Women are the biodiversity
experts of the world[. Unfortunately, girls are being denied their
potential as food producers and biodiversity experts under the dual
pressure of invisibility and domination of industrial
agriculture.]{.underline}5 While women manage and produce diversity, the
dominant paradigm of agri- culture promotes monoculture on the false
assumption that monocultures produce more. Monocultures do not produce
more, they control more. As FAO\'s World Food Day report, a study in
eastern Nigeria found occupying only 2 percent of a household farmland
accounted for h total output[. Navdanya\'s studies on biodiversity-based
ecologica that **women-run farms produce more food and nutrition than in
farms**.6 Quite clearly, if women\'s knowledge was not being rendered
invisible, the use of the 2 percent land under polyculture systems
should be the path followed for providing food security. Instead, these
highly productive systems are **being destroyed in the name of producing
more food**.]{.underline} Just as women\'s ways of growing food produce
more while conserving more resources, women\'s ways of food processing
conserve more nutrition. Hand pound- ing of rice or milling rice with a
foot-operated mortar and pestle preserves more protein, fat, fiber, and
minerals in rice. [Thus when mechanical hullers replace hand pounding by
women as in the case of Bangladesh where 700 new mills supplanted the
paid work of 100,000 to 140,000 women in one year by reducing the labor
input from 270 hours per ton to 5. They not only rob women of work and
livelihoods, they also rob girls of essential nutrients. Yet this
process of food value destruction is called \"value addition\" in
**patriarchal economics**.]{.underline} Feeding the world requires
producing more food and nutrition with fewer resources - i.e., producing
more with less. In this, women are experts and their expert- ise needs
to filter into our institutions of agricultural research and
development. However[, instead of building on women\'s expertise in
feeding the world through diversity, the dominant system is rushing
headlong into destroying diver- sity and women\'s food-producing
capacities, the pirating the results of centuries of innovating and
breeding through patenting.]{.underline} Lack of women\'s property
rights are a major constraint on women\'s capacity to feed the world.
These property rights include rights to land, and common prop- erty
rights to common resources like water and biodiversity. [Women have been
the custodians of biodiversity. New intellectual property rights are
**alienating women\'s rights to biodiversity and erasing their
innovation embodied in agricultural bio- diversity**.]{.underline} If
the erosion of women\'s capacity for feeding the world has to be
prevented, I PR regimes need to evolve sui generis systems that
recognize and protect women\'s collective and informal innovation[.
While women are being denied their rights to resources and we are
**seeing the feminization of subsistence agriculture**, the **dominant
agriculture is showing increasing signs of masculinization** as it
appropriates resources and rights from women in subsistence agriculture
and presents itself as the only alternative for feed- ing the
world.]{.underline}

### Food Security Link (Short)

**Agriculture no longer under women's hands leads to food transforming
into a commodity**

**Shiva 09**

\[Vandana Shiva, Indian scholar, environmental activist, food

[From seed to table, **the food chain is gendered**]{.underline}. [When
seeds and food are in women\'s hands]{.underline}, [seeds reproduce and
multiply freely]{.underline}, food is shared freely and respected.
However, women\'s seed and food economy has been discounted as
\"productive work.\" [Women\'s seed and food knowled has been discounted
as knowledge]{.underline}. [Globalization has led to the transfer of
seed and food from women\'s hands to corporate hands]{.underline}. [Seed
is now]{.underline} patented and [genetically engineered]{.underline}.
It is treated a the creation and \"property\" of corporations like
Monsanto. [Renewable se becomes nonrenewable]{.underline}. Sharing and
saving seed becomes a crime. [Diversity, nourished by centuries of
women\'s breeding, disappears]{.underline}, and with it the culture and
natural evolution that is embodied in the diversity is lost forever.
[Food]{.underline}, too, is [transformed in corporate
hands]{.underline}. It is [no longe]{.underline}r our
[nourishment,]{.underline} it becomes [a commodity]{.underline}. And as
a commodity [it can be manipulated and monopolized]{.underline}. If food
grain makes more money as cattle feed than it does as food for human
consumption, it becomes cattle feed. If food grain converted to biofuel
run automobiles is more profitable, it becomes ethanol and biodiesel. 

**Industrialization of agriculture under capitalist patriarchy links
directly to the disappearance of biodiversity**

Food riots do bring the politics of hunger to the front page of the
media. But there is a [hidden hunger]{.underline} that [denies nearly a
billion people of their right to food.]{.underline} And there is a
problem of [malnutrition related to obesity and other food-related dis-
eases]{.underline}. [Hunger and obesity]{.underline} (or the fears of
it) [are feminist issues]{.underline} both because [their worst victims
are women and girls]{.underline}, and also [because they are result of a
food sys- tem shaped and controlled by capitalist
patriarchy.]{.underline} Malnutrition is both a result of denial of
access of food as well as disappear- ance of nutrition from our farms
and processing systems. **[Disappearance of biodiversity]{.underline}**
on farms is [l**inked to disappearance of women from
farms**.]{.underline} This is food insecurity for the girl child.
[Malnutrition in childhood leads to malnutrition in
adulthoo]{.underline}d. Anemia is the most significant deficiency women
suffer from. Anemia is also the most significant reason for maternal
mor- tality. [When underfed girls become mothers, they give birth to
low-birth-weight babies, vulnerable to disease and deprived of their
right to full, healthy, wholesome personhood]{.underline}. Usually these
issues of health are not connected to growing of food and farm- ing. But
nutrition begins on the farm, and malnutrition begins on the farm. We
are what we eat. But what are we eating? What are we growing on our
farms? How are we growing it? What impact does it have on our health and
on the planet? Food safety, food security, and agriculture are
intimately interrelated. How we grow our food and what we grow
determines what we eat and who eats. It determines the quality and
safety of our food. Yet food safety, food security, and agriculture have
been separated from one another. Food is being produced in ways that is
robbing the majority of people of food, and those who are eating are
eating bad food. Third- World countries are carrying a double burden of
food-related disease, hunger, and obesity. The WHO/FAO have predicted
that by the year 2020 it is pro- jected that 70 percent of ischaemic
heart disease deaths, 75 percent of stroke deaths, and 70 percent of
diabetes deaths will occur in developing countries. These [dis- eases,
called noncommunicable diseases, are directly linked to
diet]{.underline}. The world is producing enough food for all. However,
[billions are being denied their right to food]{.underline}. The
globalized industrialized food system is creating hunger in many ways.
Firstly, [industrialized agriculture is based on destruction of small
farmers]{.underline}. Uprooted and dispossessed peasants join the ranks
of the hungry. Secondly, industrialized agriculture is capital
intensive. It is based on costly external inputs such as purchased and
nonrenewable seeds, synthetic fertilizers, pes- ticides, herbicides.
Peasants get into debt to buy these inputs. To pay back debt they must
sell all they grow, thus depriving themselves of food. If they cannot
pay their debts they loose their land. And they are increasingly loosing
their lives. [More than 150,000 farmers in India have committed suicide
as costs of inputs have increased, and the price of their produce has
fallen, thus trapping them into debt]{.underline}. Malnutrition and
hunger is also growing because farmers are being pushed into growing
cash crops for exports. The nature of agriculture and the nature of food
is being transformed. Agri- culture, the care of the land, the culture
of growing good food is being transformed into corporate, industrial
activity. [**Food is being transformed** from being a source of
nutrition and sustenance **into being a commodity**]{.underline}. And as
a commodity, it will first flow to factory farms and now cars. [The poor
will get the leftover]{.underline}. Factory farms are a negative food
system. They consume more food than they produce. Industrial beef
requires 10 kg of feed to produce 1 kg of food. Industrial pork requires
4.0-5.5 kg of feed to produce 1 kg of food. Factory- farmed chicken
requires 2.0-3.0 times more feed than it produces as food.10 Industrial
biofuels are putting a new pressure on food. [Food]{.underline} prices
in Mexico have doubled since corn, the staple for Mexican tortillas, is
being increasingly used to make ethanol for fuel. Corn, soya, and canola
[are all being diverted to feed cars while people starve.]{.underline}

### Language Link 

#### **US officials uses terms associated with gender sterotypes to describe other nations -- lays foundation for hegemonic masculinity mindset of the U.S.**

[Throughout the Cold War, metaphors of gender and of pathology re mained
available to those officials or analysts who sought to emphasize the
\"Soviet threat.\" Just as Kennan at the onset of the Cold [War employed
emotive language to signify the Soviets as a hypermasculine, monstrous
force]{.mark}, two decades later [other officials used similar
representations to delegiti mate what they feared as uncontrolled
détente along the German-German border]{.mark}. As Foreign Minister
Willy Brandt reached out to the German Demo cratic Republic, a U.S.
State Department analysis in October 1968 characterized his nascent
Ostpolitik as \"the near-pathetic speeches and statem leaders
overflowing with \'good will\' and asking friend and foe and at least
\'understanding.\' \" [The State Department docum from this behavior
that West Germans \"are not only jittery and that they feel helpless.\"
The language here - \"near-pathetic,\" \" ened,\" and \"helpless\" -
coded the West Germans as emasculated suggested that West Germans had
lost their self-discipline and uphold necessary boundaries.]{.mark} The
position of the word \"overfl \"leaders\" suggested that not only the
statements and speeches o but also those officials themselves were
spilling over with fem or sympatny, good win, ana understanding - not
tne stun or reaipoiitiK.]{.underline} Furthermore, the document argued,
the West as a whole had demonstrated \"marked passivity,\" in the face
of the August 1968 Czech invasion and appeared \"rather soft\" on the
issue of access to Berlin. [In language that recalled Kennan\'s long
telegram, the [State Department document contrasted the insufficient
masculinity of the West with the invasive hypermasculinity of the
East]{.mark}. \"Coldly systematic and inexorable,\" the East Germans
were becoming \"harder and harsher\" and appeared ready to \"dem
onstrate to Bonn its utter impotence and helplessness.\" [East Germany
would accomplish this final rape and emasculation \"by sudden rapid
thrusts\" of \"specialized forces\" into West Berlin]{.mark}.\'4 This
characterization of détente as making the West vulnerable to
emasculation did not mean that the U.S. government opposed détente as
such. Rather, détente was a contested policy[; this document represented
thinking that remained locked in the Cold War paradigm]{.mark}; and even
proponents of détente such as Elenry Kissinger wanted the United States
to control the process and to prevent a race to Moscow]{.underline}.
Although this essay focuses on the emotive language used by U.S.
officials to naturalize their superiority and to depoliticize the
Western allies\' contrary points of view, such language was not, of
course, an American monopoly. Rather, [[tropes of gender, pathology, and
other figures of speech]{.mark} --- which draw their emotional power
from deeply felt notions about the body, the psyche, and the supposed
immutable order of the most private aspects of life [- are available to
any people who believe themselves superior to, and able to judge,
others]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is not surprising, therefore, to find
that British Treasury and Foreign Office officials used such discourse,
notably in 1945---46, when they still hoped to regain their prewar
prominence and to guide their presumptively less sophisticated
transatlantic cousins. [British analysts clung to a structure of meaning
based on the perceived opposition between their masculine rationality
--- \"ripe and calm wisdom,\" as John Maynard Keynes put it --- and the
Americans\' less-than-mas culine emotionalism]{.underline}. The British
ambassador in Washington depicted Ameri can leaders as suffering from
\"uneasy bewilderment,\" \"fear of the unknown,\" \"baffled dismay,\"
and \"a constant disposition to prefer the emotional to the rational
approach.\" Furthermore, the Americans were \"nervous,\" \"lackjed\]

To counter U.S. bragging about the atomic bomb - that \"hubbub of
emotional talk\" - the United Kingdom would marshal its own
masculine-coded superweapon, namedly \"lucid \... appeals to reason and
the logic of hard fact

### Military Link

#### The military is the most fundamental representation of masculinity and justifies war in order to protect the women

**Christensen 22** \[Ann-Dorte, Professor of Sociology and Social work,
Aalborg University, "From military to militarizing masculinites" NORMA\]

In many societies, the [military institution is discursively constructed
as a key 'masculinity maker]{.underline}'; compulsory military service
is considered a disciplinary rite de passage that turns boys into men.
Hence, the relationship between masculinities, warfare and the military
as a social institution is an important field of inquiry for feminist
research and critical masculinity studies (Connell, 1995). As such, [it
has provoked theoretical discussions about the reproduction of
patriarchal gender relations and hegemonic masculinity]{.underline} as
well as rich empirical work on the construction of military
masculinities and the performances and experiences of being a soldier
(Barrett, 1996; Do & Samuels, 2021). At the same time, critical
scholarship within feminism, gender studies and military studies has
widened the analysis of militarism and war to encompass cultural and
institutional processes of militarization beyond the military as an
institution, for instance in relation to violent masculinities, popular
culture, social protest and changes (Woodward & Duncanson, 2017; see
also NORMA Volume 10, Number 3--4, 2015)1 The American feminist theorist
Cynthia Enloe (2000) has argued that [the male soldier, represented as
the hero and the warrior, is one of the most fundamental representations
of masculinity]{.underline}, and R.W. Connell (1995) has argued that the
[military is the most important arena for defining hegemonic masculinity
in a European and American context]{.underline}. [This basic assumption
about gender connotations, presenting men as aggressive and violent
protectors and women as peaceful and non-violent caregivers, has
characterized feminist studies and critical military studies during the
last decades]{.underline} (Duncanson, 2015, 2020; Higate, 2003; Morgan,
1994; Sørensen 2015; Yuval-Davis, 1997; Woodward & Jenkings, 2011). Many
feminist scholars have also used the concept of hegemonic masculinities
to grasp the dynamic and the contradictions within militarized
masculinities. Claire Duncanson, for instance, has argued that the
concept has been an important analytical tool for critical scholars in
highlighting the multiple, dynamic and contradictory character of
masculinities in the military. It has underlined that the ideal of
'combat-experienced commanding officer is not the only form of
masculinity, but it is a very powerful model, which through consent, has
dominated as one form of "ideal man"' (Duncanson, 2020, p. 471). Some
scholars have argued that while military studies and feminist research
have given much attention to the construction of militarized
masculinities within the military system, less scholarly attention has
been paid to veteran masculinities in transitions from military to
civilian life after deployment. This raises important questions about
if, how, or to what extend militarized masculinities can be unmade and
deconstructed, and how these processes interfere in family lives and
social relations? (Bulmer & Eichler, 2017; Moelker, Andres, Bowen, &
Manigart, 2015). [War and military are closely connected to nationalist
discourses. These are based on the classical distinction between
citizen-the-mother and citizen-the soldier and the conceptualizations of
men as aggressive and violent, fighting for the sake of women and
children, and women as peaceful anti-violent mothers]{.underline}
(Encloe, 1980; Pateman, 1988; Yuval-Davis, 1997). Even though these
traditional constructions have been challenged in recent decades, they
are still alive and often emerge in new forms, for instance in arguments
for Western military international intervention (Messerschmidt James,
2010) as well as in presentations of women going into the army or
returning from military service (Alexiyevich, 1988). In many historical
and contemporary contexts, [militarized masculinities are also closely
related to political power and dominance]{.underline}. [This has for
instance been the case in the United States, where military position and
experience have been important for political influence]{.underline}; for
instance, the position as a war hero or the opposite -- a 'wimp' --
characterized the public image of the presidents George H.W. Bush and
his son, George W. Buch (Ducat, 2004; Messerschmidt James, 2010).
Important theoretical contributions have been made by critical scholars
who study militarization of social and cultural institutions beyond the
military (Enloe, 2000; Giroux, 2008). One of the most influential
scholars, Catherine Lutz, argues that: [Militarization is intimately
connected not only to the obvious -- the increasing size of armies and
the resurgence of militant nationalisms and militant fundamentalisms --
but also to the less visible deformation of human potentials into the
hierarchies of race, class, gender, and sexuality, and to the shaping of
national histories in ways that glorify and legitimate military
action]{.underline}. (Lutz, 2007, p. 320) Scholars studying
militarization have further explored how popular cultural
representations of soldier and war romanticize and normalize violence,
especially through Hollywood films (Behnke, 2006; Boggs & Pollard, 2017;
Davies & Philpott, 2012; Stahl, 2010) but also through other media. Book
markets have in recent decades become infused with war memories written
by former soldiers (see Woodward & Jenkings, 2018). Of countless
examples, two are Mark Owen -- who claims to have been the one killing
Osama Bin Laden -- and Chris Kyle, who's bestselling autobiography
American Sniper also became a huge blockbuster movie. Persons with
experience as Navy Seals have also had commercial successes in the
self-help and leadership industry in recent years. [An example is Jocko
Willink, a highly decorated former Navy Seal commander of Seal team 3' s
Task Unit Bruiser (which included Chris Kyle) in Ramadi, Irak. Upon
retiring in 2010, Willink has become somewhat of a media celebrity on
YouTube, Ted-Talks, podcasts, as well as a business consultant and
bestselling author of several leadership and children's books. In these
books and media appearances, Willink thus converted his embodied 'war
capital' and military masculinity into a prospering business and in the
process contributes to reproducing the symbolic relationship between
military masculinity and hegemonic masculinity.]{.underline}

### Outer Space Link 

#### Space exploration represents the fantasy of western colonialism. White valiant masculine representation of space programs excludes women and minorities

**Lanius 08** (Roger D., Senior Curator Division of Space History
National Air and Space Museum Smithsonian Institution, "Heroes in a
Vacuum: The Apollo Astronaut as Cultural Icon." The Florida Historical
Quarterly, vol. 87, no. 2, Fall 2008, JSTOR,
<http://www.jstor.org/stable/20700214>, pd)

In both fact and fiction, the space suit has been a core representation
of the astronaut, essentially a knight\'s armor worn heroically as the
individual conducts his noble mission. More than any other single
artifact of the Moon landing program the Apollo [[space]{.mark} suit
[represent]{.mark}ed the values that supported Americans going into
space in the first place. It symbolized and reified the [Utopian desire
to colonize the Solar System]{.mark} and make a perfect society at a new
and pristine place beyond the corrupt Earth]{.underline}. It also stood,
as cultural historian Debra Benita Shaw wrote, \"as a metaphor for the
transcendent power of scientific ingenuity and technological
know-how\....It is thus a significant icon in contemporary cultural
representations of the body in both outer and terrestrial space.\"56 As
an enduring icon of Apollo, [the [space suited astronauts on the Moon
conjured images of power and masculinity]{.mark} far beyond that
actually present.]{.underline} The anonymity of those astronauts, with
their visors down similar to Medieval knights made them even more
mysterious and attractive. [Without intending it, [the space suit became
synonymous with a set of values referring \"to heroism and]{.mark} thus
to the Cartesian ([masculine]{.mark}]{.underline}) subject identified by
the Proper Name but the Name itself becomes curiously disconnected from
the individual to which it actually refers.\"57 At some level, there
fore, the Apollo [[astronaut in his space suit projected the image of
the hardbody of masculinity]{.underline}]{.mark} that Susan Jeffords
believes became so prevalent in the 1980s, anticipating that later
development by twenty years.58 By being consumed by a space suit, as
Donna Haraway has pointed out, the astronaut essentially became a cyborg
as an iconic space suit established the relationship between human and
machine. Cyborg ontology is a critical element of thinking about the
duality of this relationship, confounding the sense in which bodies move
in apposition to the technology.59 Megan Stern\'s analysis of visored
astronauts in spacesuits suggest that they are essentially anonymous, a
screen on which anyone might project any attribute from fantasies of
heroism to submission. Therefore, the Apollo astronauts in their suits
became screens for the whole of America to project its hopes, wishes,
fears, and horrors. Each astro naut felt this keenly, as they have lived
out the remainder of their lives in the glare of American fame and the
sense of expectations never fully satisfied. Unable always to reflect
the qualities of strength, authority, and rationality so often projected
on them, the astronauts have displayed a fragility since Apollo that is
both perplexing and troubling for many who see them in later years.60
Marina Benjamin described this best when she encountered three Apollo
astronauts at a celebrity and collectors show. She wrote that they were
\"just like movie stars; they burned brightly in the glare of publicity
when they were offered good parts to play and then, when the roles dried
up, so did they.\" Their space suits, how ever, represented the triumph
of technology over living organ isms.61 Those suits dominate the essence
of what it means to be an astronaut; they have since Apollo and continue
to do so today. [The Apollo [astronauts]{.mark} all [had]{.mark} an
[image of]{.mark} hard-working, fun loving, [virile representations of
masculinity]{.mark}. The expression of [public comfort with the white
male establishment is palpable]{.mark} throughout the recounting of the
story of Apollo]{.underline}. The quintessential company man worked for
NASA during Apollo. The engineering \"geeks\" of Mission Control, with
their short-sleeved white shirts, narrow black ties, slide rules hung on
their belts like sidearms, and their pocket protectors complete with
compass and ruler and myriad pens and mechanical pencils all personified
a conservative America that many looked back on with fondness and
nostalgia. Even Norman Mailer, as much an embodiment of the Sixties
counter-culture as anyone, ranted about this aspect of Apollo while
covering the Moon landings in 1969. Mailer expressed fascination and not
a little perplexity with the time warp that he witnessed at the Manned
Spacecraft Center in Houston. [He railed against an [overwhelmingly
white male NASA steeped in middle class values and reverence for the
American flag and main stream cultur]{.mark}]{.underline}[e.]{.mark}
Mailer grudgingly admitted, however, that NASA\'s approach to task
accomplishment---which he viewed as the embodiment of the Protestant
Work Ethic---and its technological. and scientific capability got
results with Apollo. Even so, he hated NASA\'s closed and austere
society, one where he believed out siders were distrusted and held at
arm\'s length with a bland and faceless courtesy that betrayed nothing.
For all of his skepticism, for all of his esotericism, Mailer captures
much of interest concerning rocket technology and the people who
produced it in Project Apollo.62 lo.62 Mailer\'s critique foreshadows by
twenty-five years a powerful nostalgia that has grown up around Apollo
as a program that was done right, in no small part because it took place
within the cultur al confines of an era before the social revolution of
the 1960s. Nothing captures this nostalgia more effectively than the
feature film, Apollo 13. Set in 1970 when an explosion crippled a lunar
landing mission and NASA nearly lost astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise,
and Jack Swigert, it has been recast as one of NASA\'s finest hours, a
successful failure. At 56 hours into the flight an oxygen tank in the
Apollo service module ruptured and damaged several of the power,
electrical, and life support systems. People through out the world
watched and waited and hoped as NASA personnel on the ground and the
crew worked to find a way safely home. It was a close-run thing, but the
crew returned safely on April 17, 1970. The near disaster served several
important purposes for the civil space program---especially prompting
reconsideration of the propriety of the whole effort while also
solidifying in the popular mind NASA\'s collective genius.63 While one
must give the NASA flight team high marks for perseverance, dedication,
and an unshakable belief that they could bring the crew home safely, it
is quite strange that no one seems to realize that the mission had
already failed, and failed catastrophically, by the time of accident.64
The fact that Apollo 13 is now viewed as one of NASA\'s shining moments
says much about the ability of humanity to recast historical events into
meaningful morality plays. In this instance, Apollo 13 became a vehicle
for criticism of the social order that emerged from the 1960s and a
celebration of an earlier age. When the film appeared in 1995, reviewer
John Powers, writing for the Washington Post, commented on its incessant
[[nostalgia for \"the]{.mark} [paradisiacal America]{.mark} invoked by
Ronald Reagan and Pat Buchananan America [where men were men, women were
subservient, and people of color kept out of the
way]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" In addition, Powers wrote, \"Its [[story
line]{.underline}]{.mark} could be a Republican parable about 1995
America: [A [marvelous vessel loses its power and speeds toward
extinction, until it\'s saved by a team of heroic white
men]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" If anything, Powers underemphasized the
white America evoked in Apollo 13. There were no people of color in the
film and the only women with speaking parts of substance was Marilyn
Lovell (Kathleen Quinlin), wife of the Apollo 13 command er, whose role
is distinctly one of offering proud support while pri vately fearing the
worst, and their daughter whose role seems to be as spokesperson for the
social revolution then underway while con sistently reflecting its least
important elements. For example, she complains in a shriekish voice that
the Beatles had just broken up and that her world has accordingly
collapsed. The heroes of Apollo 13 are the geeks of Mission Control,
with the astronauts aboard the spacecraft as spirited but metaphorically
emasculated characters to be saved. Lovell, Haise, and Swigert must wait
to be rescued in a manner not unlike Rapunzel, as an active participant
but unable to accomplish the task alone. As historian Tom D. Crouch
wrote of this film\'s depiction of the \"studs\" in Mission Control: The
real heroes of this film are either bald or sporting brush cuts; wear
thick glasses; are partial to rumpled short sleeve shirts; and
chain-smoke an endless string of cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. For all
of that, these slide rule wielding technonerds solve all of the
difficult problems required to bring the crew home. They are, in the
words of one of the astronauts portrayed in the film, \"steely-eyed
missile men.\"65 Apollo 13 the film, accordingly, opens the possibility
of the astro naut hero as helpless surrogate of a collection of really
smart nerds on a mission. [The Mission Control team, in an interesting
transference of masculine power from the astronauts,]{.underline} assume
in the best sense of American reverence for the underdog canonical
status. It also venerates a long past era in American history. Indeed,
it may have been an era already gone by the time of the actual mission
in 1970. It is a hallowing of masculinity in a nostalgic context. A
recent study completed for NASA concluded that representation of space
exploration on film is highly nostalgic, and Apollo fuels that
perception: As a group, the public entertainments we tend to buy into
are either nostalgic visions of the \"space race\" period (\"The Right
Stuff,\" \"Apollo 13,\" \"From the Earth to the Moon\") or fantasies
reflecting the romantic imagination of the Flash Gordon/Buck Rogers era
(\"Star Wars\" rather than \"Star Trek\"). These are the visions people
support in the most meaningful way possible: with their time and dol
lars\....Boomers have a great nostalgic affection for NASA, but their
own priorities have shifted from a future focus to maintaining what they
have. They see money spent on space exploration as threatening their
future entitle ments.66 At a sublime level, the Apollo astronauts may
serve as a trope for a larger lack of interest in the future expressed
by Americans at the beginning of the twenty-first century. As a country,
a shifting cultural center of gravity toward maintenance of the status
quo rather than looking to the future may have stalled. A shared
national vision that energized earlier efforts

### Syntethic Biotech Link

**Synthetic biotech is projected as a masculine profession oppressing
women and making them a minority**

Studies, University of Edinburgh, "Gender in synthetic biology: problems
and potential,"
https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embr.201949049\]

[Gender discrimination has been a problem in Western science and
engineering since their start as masculine professions]{.underline} 234.
Despite admirable progress, the [association between STEM and
masculinity persists]{.underline} 5. [Women remain a minority in most
STEM professions and face challenges not experienced by their male
colleagues]{.underline}. [Synthetic biology is not immune to these
problems. One reason is the central role played by engineering as a
template for synthetic biology. As a result, synthetic biologists model
their field on those STEM professions that have been the least welcoming
to women and are most strongly associated with men and
masculinity]{.underline}. In 2015, the American Association of
University Women 6 reported that women make up only 19% of US
engineering bachelor\'s graduates and 23% of its doctorates. In the
workforce, women make up proportions of only 6% (petroleum engineering)
to 21% (environmental engineering). The US Department of Commerce 7, the
European Commission 8 and the UK House of Commons 9 have released
similar statistics. [Widespread beliefs that engineering is masculine
work contribute to such low representation]{.underline}. Building a new
research field is about making choices. All choices have consequences,
including unseen and unexpected ones. An engineering template might
encourage synthetic biologists to shun projects or ideas that do not
look enough like established engineering. Similarly, [archetypes that
portray engineering as a masculine profession might make women in
synthetic biology appear incongruous or incapable]{.underline}.

### Terrorism Link 

#### The affs articulation of anti-terrorism through NATO portrays women as victims needing masculine men to save them

**Hurley 14** (Hurley, M E (2014) Gendering NATO: Analyzing the
Construction and Implementation of the North Atlantic
Treaty-Organization's Gender Perspective PhD, Oxford Brookes University)

[These **feminist critiques of the War on Terror** therefore exposed the
construction and the use¶ of 'other' (i.e. non-western) women within the
narratives of this reinvigorated atmosphere of¶ **war and
militarism**.]{.underline} As Krista Hunt (2002) notes the gendered
natures of narratives such as:¶ "look at what they do to their women",
have 'political currency' (2002: 116); furthering a¶ 43¶ contrast
between the 'civilised west' and the 'uncivilised Afghan society' in
need of saving¶ (Ibid). [Hunt identified 'two-distinct but complementary
images of Afghan women' portrayed¶ in the media and political discourse:
Afghan women were portrayed as passive victims of the¶ Taliban and on
the other as vocal opponents of that regime (2002: 117), thus serving
to¶ legitimise and 'moralise' the forceful overthrow of the regime and
the subsequent¶ occupation (Ibid). The war on terror was then framed in
large part by a notion of what¶ Miriam Cooke termed 'saving brown women'
(2002: 468)21.]{.underline} Upon taking command of the¶ International
Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan**[, NATO]{.underline}**
took up this mantle.¶ Indeed, Von der Lippe & Väyrynen (2011) suggest
that the "saving brown women from¶ brown men" narrative combined with
UNSCR 1325 to 'facilitate a metamorphosis of the¶ **[militaristic and
masculine-led NATO]{.underline}** into a collective peacekeeper'
(2011:26) and champion¶ of women's rights - See Figure 1. [This notion
of NATO as a paternal peacekeeper]{.underline} will be¶ returned to in
Chapter 3, **[in]{.underline}** a discussion of Iris Young's (2003)
notion of the 'logic of¶ masculinist protection'.¶ Figure 1: "NATO: Keep
the Progress Going!" -- An Amnesty International Poster22¶ [The
'gendering' of the war on terror was not simply limited to an 'othering'
of Afghan¶ women and men and the 'terrorist enemy'.]{.underline} Hunt
(2002) notes that:¶ ["the media coverage and political discourse
following the attacks on the USA¶ exemplify the way that images of
women...are being used to define the conflict; for¶ the most part women
have been depicted as silent victims of the attacks...women¶ are cast as
passive]{.underline}" (2002: 117).¶ [In this sense the feminist
literature dealing specifically with 9/11 and its aftermath detailed¶
the gendered processes, and the reassertion of specific gendered
orthodoxies]{.underline} ([**women as¶ passive victims in need of
saving**) necessary in the production of war narratives.]{.underline} In
this¶ respect their work draws interesting parallels with that of Susan
Jeffords (1989) account of¶ the '[re-masculinisation' of American
culture following the Vietnam war]{.underline} (Section 3, below).¶ [In
one respect the aims and findings of this thesis sit within this
'historical-social-political'¶ context. It can be argued that the
effects of 9/11 are still being felt within the international¶ political
system and especially in the western security infrastructure -- at the
time of writing¶ this thesis, NATO, is managing a 'transition' from
Afghanistan.¶ Detailed, experience-focused feminist analyses of the war
on terror and its associated¶ conflicts]{.underline} (see also Enloe,
2010[) built upon early feminist IR scholarship and helped to
reinterrogate the gendered processes and sites of war and militarism in
the first decade of the¶ twenty-first century.]{.underline} As Ayotte &
Husain argue: "[In the wake of the 'war on terrorism'¶ feminist analysis
of international relations must broaden the concept of security to
consider¶ forms of violence beyond the statist security framework of
realpolitik]{.underline}" (Ayotte & Husain,¶ 2005: 112); whilst I feel
that Ayotte & Husain's assertion somewhat neglects the important¶
contributions of early feminist writing, that began to do exactly that
(Tickner, 1992; Enloe¶ 1989; Squires 1998[) it represents a continuation
of that work as well as a shift in certain¶ areas of feminist research
towards centralising the study of war and security within a FSS¶ agenda,
and Christine Sylvester's 'new feminist war studies' (2013: 49 --
emphasis added).¶ The research outlined above has detailed how Feminist
International Relations research has¶ developed. In troubling the
existing boundaries of IR and Security Studies as an academic¶
discipline the place and purpose of a distinctly Feminist IR is
problematised. Should¶ Feminist IR remain embedded within the
disciplinary boundaries, concepts and language of¶ IR, seeking to carve
out a distinctly feminist space? Some have argued that in doing so,¶
Feminist IR would become defined by and produce work that was simply
intelligible to,¶ rather than challenging to IR's
mainstream]{.underline} (Lobasz & Sjoberg, 2011:574; Youngs, 2004;¶
Squires & Welds, 2007; Zalewski, 2007). This debate is ongoing, yet what
the research¶ outlined above (and below) demonstrate is the value of
[feminist research both within and¶ without IR in exposing the gendered
nature of the international; in exposing the¶ incompleteness of accounts
that fail to address gender and experience,]{.underline} and that in the
words¶ of Cynthia Enloe (1989) it is gender that makes the world go
round. 

## Alternative

#### Alt solves -- Feminism is the only solution to the continuum of violence. Overthrow of the patriarchy is key to preventing nuclear war.

**Eschle 13** (Catherine, University of Strathclyde, "Gender and the
Subject of (Anti)Nuclear Politics: Revisiting Women\'s Campaigning
against the Bomb", 2013, International Studies Quarterly Vol. 57, No. 4
(December 2013), <https://www.jstor.org/stable/24014644>, pd)

However, [[women\'s antinuclear activism, and indeed nuclear politics
more generally,4 has faded]{.mark} from the pur¬view of gender and
security studies in recent years]{.underline}. [[This is
problematic]{.mark}, in the first place because it means femi¬nist IR
scholars have paid negligible attention to post-Cold War nuclear
developments.]{.underline} While it could be argued this simply reflects
the demobilization of women\'s antinuclear campaigning in the United
States and UK with the end of the Cold War and the corresponding decline
of the threat posed by the nuclear arms race, feminist IR scholarship
has long contested such a straightforward empiricist reading of what
counts as wors¬thy of research. In any case, [nuclear weapons did not
dis¬appear]{.underline} in the 1990s and nor did campaigning against
them, as we are reminded by an important but neglected body of feminist
work on/aligned with critical responses to the 1997 Indian nuclear tests
(e.g., Oza 2006; Das 2007; Chowdhry No date).5 The failure more
generally in gender and security studies to engage with such
develop¬ments serves not only to fix women\'s antinuclear cam- paigning
in a particular form and to a particular moment, but also to aid the
naturalization of nuclear weapons in the post-Cold War world. An
additional problem resulting from the decline of ongoing critical
engagement with nuclear politics in gender and security studies is that
the 1980s Cold War activism of such key initial influence now tends to
be perceived in rather simplistic and even stereotyped ways. On the one
hand, the rare mentions of nuclear politics in recent over¬views of
gender and security studies imply a rather idealized view, relying as
they do on a truncated version of the narra¬tive by Enloe and Sylvester
et al. about Greenham women stepping into agency in IR, without
critically re-examining the original texts or revisiting the evidence
(Blanchard 2003:1294, 1302; Sjoberg 2009:197, note 84; Shepherd
2010a,b:78-9).6 The cumulative result is the romanticiza¬tion of the
figure of the Cold War woman antinuclear cam¬paigner as a kind of
feminist warrior who has now passed into the history books. On the other
hand, in gender and security studies more generally, these same
campaigners have been effectively demonized. With feminist IR scholars
forced to confront misreadings of their own project as bio¬logically
determinist by the mainstream of IR (see Tickner 1999; Shepherd 2010a),
and with the rising popularity in the field of antiessentialist
poststructuralist approaches, initial anxieties about women\'s peace
politics have been strongly reinforced and attention has swung sharply
in the opposite direction, toward investigations of the role of women as
gender-destabilizing agents of political violence. There is an implicit
assumption here that the Cold War [[anti¬nuclear activist is
intrinsically pacific and gender-conserva-tive, the nemesis of feminist
IR]{.mark} rather than its lost hope]{.underline}. As Tina Managhan has
indicated (2007), however, such an assumption can and should be
scrutinized. In line with Managhan, my starting point in this article is
the proposition that an antiessentialist, poststructural¬ist-influenced
methodology, far from necessitating the avoidance of women\'s
antinuclear activism, can illumi¬nate it in fresh and interesting ways.
Recent systematiza¬tions of this methodology in gender and security
studies are set out in part one, along with the parameters of my
empirical research. I then go on in part two to identify the \"basic
discourses\" in circulation among women cam¬paigners against nuclear
weapons in the United States and UK in the later Cold War period, each
offering differently gendered constructions of the political subject
mobilized in antinuclear struggle. In the third and final part of the
article, I explore the ways in which these discourses are reproduced and
reconfigured in the post-Cold War texts of Helen. Caldicott, in the
United States, and Angie Zelter, in the UK. In so doing, I argue that
there were multiple figures of the antinuclear campaigner circulating in
Cold War women\'s activism and that new subjectivities are emerging in
contemporary writing in ways that reflect and reproduce the shift from a
Cold War to a post-Cold War context and the differing political
environments of the United States and UK. I conclude that gender and
security scholars ought therefore to revi¬sit fixed, unitary assumptions
about the identities of women antinuclear campaigners, as one element in
a broader, critical reengagement with the gendered dimen¬sions of
nuclear politics. I close by suggesting some future lines of enquiry for
such an undertaking, with The literature in IR combining
poststructuralism and feminism is heterogeneous and rapidly expanding,
but it is specifically the recent methodological recommenda¬tions with
regard to gender and security studies devel¬oped separately by Lene
Hansen and Laura J. Shepherd that I am interested in here. For these
scholars, the sub-stantive focus of poststructuralist-influenced
feminist enquiry should be on the discursive construction of gen¬dered
subjects in global politics. Thus, Hansen states, \" \[t\]he
relationship between identity and foreign policy is at the center of
poststructuralism\'s research agenda\" (2006:1), while for Shepherd it
is her specifically feminist \"curiosity about \'the concept, nature and
practice of gender\"\' and the ways in which \"gender configures
boundaries of subjectivity\" in IR that drives her research (Shepherd
2008a:3, citing Zalewski). To conceive of gen¬dered selfhood as
discursively constructed is to see it as \"existing only insofar as it
is continually rearticulated and uncontested by competing discourses\"
(Hansen 2006:6). Defined as systems of meaning and representa¬tion,
discourses are claimed to \"fix\" self-understandings and
interpretations of the world, and thus to reproduce power relations
(Shepherd 2008a:20-3), albeit always tem¬porarily and in incomplete
ways. We are thus enjoined to enquire into \"multiple and competing
discourses about gender \... and security \... \[which\] articulate
specific sub¬jects, ascribe identities to these subjects and position
them in relation to each other\" (Shepherd 2010b:76), thereby
instantiating gendered relations of domination and resistance. As both
Shepherd and Hansen make clear, the \"discur¬sive ontology\" (Hansen
2006:17) underpinning their approach is radically antiessentialist. In
general terms, it entails rejection of the analytical utility of
distinguishing between nondiscursive and discursive realms, and with
this the possibility of enquiring into the material roots of tex¬tual
representations, in favor of illuminating how material realities become
interpreted as such (Hansen 2006:21-3; Shepherd 2008a:17-19). More
specifically, this is an ontol¬ogy that goes beyond the argument in
earlier second-wave feminism that the biological fixities of sex are
distinct from and nondetermining of gendered identities and roles that
are rather socially constructed and challengeable. A
post¬structuralist-influenced feminist perspective necessitates rather a
more thorough-going discursive constructionism in which the continual
reenactment of the gender norms circulating in discourse is seen to
shape and give meaning to concrete bodily differences. On this view, the
chief task of the scholar bridging feminist and poststructuralist
tradi¬tions should be to destabilize apparent certainties about both sex
and gender rather than to make claims about or on behalf of gendered
identities and thus reinforce power relations. In this light, my claim
that Hansen and Shep¬herd\'s framework can help to illuminate
antinuclear cam¬paigning by women needs some justification. There are
two issues here that need disentangling. The first has to do with
biological essentialism, and whether women\'s antinuclear activism and
the study of it necessarily replicates the view that there are
characteristic male and female traits, which are presocial or natural,
and which determine immutable social and political outcomes. On this
point, it should be recalled that the pioneering feminist IR writings
mentioned above not only elaborated a critique of crass assumptions
about the embodied subjectivities of women and men circulating in
antinuclear discourses, but also lauded certain enactments of
antinuclear campaigning as destabilizing of gender certainties, most
notably at Green-ham Common. Moreover, as Managhan\'s more recent study
of campaigners at Greenham and elsewhere demonstrates (2007), even when
biologically essentialist identities are mobilized, they may have
subversive political results.? Managhan concludes that the tactical
effects of such identi¬ties should be subjected to careful empirical
investigation from a poststructuralist-feminist perspective, rather than
assumed a priori to be problematic (2007:646). By implica¬tion, their
discursive construction merits critical scrutiny, rather than dismissal
or avoidance. A second and more serious issue arises, however, if we
accept the premise that a focus on women\'s antinuclear campaigning
necessarily rests on an essentialist approach to the gendered subject in
more general terms---assuming fixed, stable entities called women who
exist prior to, and who are productive of, discourses and texts. Yet
this pre¬mise too is contestable. Many poststructuralist feminists have
argued on political grounds that it is possible to maintain a
deconstructive analytical approach toward gen¬der while simultaneously
pursuing an empirical focus on women, in an effort to avoid \"complicity
with mainstream efforts to \'write women out of IR\" \' (Managhan
2007:644, citing Sylvester). In this vein, such scholars have combined
\"elements of skepticism, particularly about the social formation of
subjects, with elements of a standpoint femi¬nism that has us
acknowledging and interpreting what subjects say\" (Sylvester 1994:52).
Others have sought to develop a more theoretically consistent
justification for their focus on women as subjects. Alison Stone, for
one, has reinterpreted Butler as implying that \"women\" have \"a
history, a genealogy, a \'line of descent\"\' (2005:5, citing Gatens;
see also 2004:15-23), with gender identities, how-ever, fleeting and
unstable crystallizing in a layering pro¬cess through which past
constructions leave their traces on what follows: \"All women thus
become located within an ongoing chain of practice and reinterpretation,
which brings them into complex filiations with one another\" (Stone
2004:19). As Shepherd concludes (2008a:4), such a view \"allows for
research that investigates the ways in which \'women\' as subjects and
objects act, speak, write and represent themselves, are represented,
written about, spoken about and acted on\" 8-including, one assumes,
within the context of antinuclear discourses. After all, these have long
been the site for the (self-)construction of feminized subjectivities in
oppositional relation to the masculinized nuclear state, albeit largely
within white, Western, middle-class parameters. So how, more concretely,
should such research on women antinuclear campaigners be conducted?
Hansen and Shepherd imply that written texts offer a particularly
fruitful starting point, as sites in which discourses about gendered
subjects are circulated and in which instances or practices of gendered
representation are embodied (Shepherd 2008a:24-5). While neither author
focuses entirely on the written word, also examining visual imagery and
the body (Hansen 2000:300-305; 2007; Shepherd 2008a:24; 2008b), their
stress on systems of representation and meaning-making nonetheless goes
hand-in-hand with an emphasis on \"the analytical centrality of
language\" (Shepherd 2008a:3) as \"articulated in written and spoken
text\" (Hansen 2006:2). In the case of antinuclear politics, such an
emphasis presents a useful empirical alternative to the mass
mobilizations and embodied practices that so caught the attention of
Enloe et al.9 These may continue to enjoy a nostalgic recirculation in
the field of gender and security studies, but are no longer
characteristic of antinu¬clear campaigning in the United States and UK
today. For advice on text selection, Hansen is particularly help¬ful.
Key to her schema is the poststructuralist assumption about the
\"intertextuality\" of discourse, that is, the view that \"texts build
their arguments and authority through references to other texts,\" often
across the boundaries of particular genres and across space and time,
shifting the contours and nodes of a discourse as they do so (Hansen
2006:8, see also 55-72). She develops several models of intertextuality,
the first focused on official discourse and documents, the second
examining also wider foreign pol¬icy debates, and a third including
either representations in popular culture, or the more \"marginal
political dis¬courses\" of social movements and academic commentary
(2006:59-64). All three models entail a preliminary focus on primary
texts with the researcher then moving outward to secondary sources and
conceptual histories, paying close attention to the rhetorical
structures typical of the different genres examined (Hansen 2006:52-4,
65-72). The selection of texts for Hansen also depends on the temporal
framing of a particular investigation (whether it examines a singular
moment, historical development over time, or compares different time
periods) and the num¬ber or type of \"Selves\" being studied, as well as
on consid¬erations of textual clarity, popularity, authority, and
availability (2006:73-87).10 Having thus identified a field of texts,
the researcher should identify within them a handful of \"basic
discourses\" that serve to structure politi¬cal discussion and
imaginative possibilities (Hansen 2006:51-2). Then \"one might
subsequently (re)turn to a detailed study of the articulations of
identity and policy within particular texts \... and situate them inside
the con¬text of the larger political debate\" (Hansen 2006:52). Shepherd
focuses her methodological arguments more on techniques of textual
analysis. She outlines two steps in this regard, the first focusing on
the \"rhetorical sche¬mata\" of a text and involving a search for the
linguistic structures that provide a sense of order in texts, thus
constructing the meaning of the concepts \... In the identifica¬tion of
representational practices specific to gender, for exam¬ple, I look for
instances of gendered identities described \"as\" or \"like\",
statements about gendered identities that can be problematized, and
emphasis on aspects of gender provided by placement within the text.
(Shepherd 2008a:30)" The second step involves an analysis of
\"predica¬tion/subject positioning\" (Shepherd 2008a:26, 30-1), which
requires unpacking both claims made about the gendered attributes of a
person or thing by examining the associated adjectives and other
descriptive words or qualifiers, and its position in relation to claims
in the text about other persons or things. This chimes with Hansen\'s
claim that a deconstructive reading illuminates identity construction in
terms of a \"process of linking,\" whereby a positive series of
signifiers are connected to a particular subject, and a \"process of
differentiation\" whereby signs gain their meaning from explicit or
implicit contrast with their opposite (2006:19-21). As Hansen reminds
us, the researcher should consider not only how discursive stabil¬ity is
achieved, but also \"instabilities and slips\" in the articulation of
relationships between identities (2006:42).12 These methodological
arguments underpin the dis¬course analysis of antinuclear women\'s
campaigning in the United States and UK that I present in the rest of
the article. In Hansen\'s terms, this is a single Self enquiry, focusing
on gendered constructions of the antinuclear activist. With regard to
its temporal framing, it is the recent historical development of this
Self which is under review, from the 1980s to the present. And with
regard to its underlying model of intertextuality, my study examines the
\"marginal political discourses\" of social movement activists, as well
as academic commentary about them. In what follows, my reading of the
material from and on activist circles in the UK and United States in the
1980s, ranging from pamphlets to academic books to Web documents, seeks
to outline the \"basic discourses\" in circulation in this period, each
mobilizing rival concep¬tions of gendered subjectivity and thus of the
antinuclear campaigner. Turning to the post-Cold War period, in which
the discursive field is sparser with little secondary commentary, I
focus on texts by two well-known cam¬paigners that I suggest serve as
sites of authoritative meaning-making among activists. A detailed
deconstruc¬tion of the rhetorical structure and predicates in these
texts is undertaken in order to expose continuities and shifts in the
gendered constructions of the earlier period. Revisiting Cold War
Discourses With the revival of the Cold War in the early 1980s and the
accompanying resurgence of the peace movement around the world, and in
the wake of the second wave of feminism, larger numbers of women than
ever before mobilized against nuclear weapons. A new generation of
all-women groups and women-led actions was launched: The United States,
for example, saw the emergence of WAND---Women\'s Action for Nuclear
Disarmament (Cal-dicott 1997:296-9)---and \"the Ribbon,\" which involved
20,000 women and their male supporters wrapping embroidered cloth around
the Pentagon (Pershing 1996). Moreover, many women did not confine
them¬selves to ostensibly feminine or civil modes of political
organizing, instead advocating changes in gender rela¬tions and
participating in the revived direct action wing of the movement
(Gusterson 1996:193-7, 213-4; Wittner 12 Shepherd advocates these
strategies within the context of a Derridean double reading (2008a:28).
This seems to be particularly suitable as a way of destabilizing texts
that have ossified interpretations with wide authority. It may be,
however, less helpful in initial efforts to uncover and unpack marginal
political discourses. 2000). It is in this context that \"Women\'s
Pentagon Action\" organized dramatic demonstrations and block¬ades, for
example (Women\'s Pentagon Action 1982; Linton and Whitham 1989), and
that the women\'s peace camp phenomenon arose. Women made their homes at
Seneca Falls and Puget Sound in the United States (Paley 1989; Russell
1989a; Krasniewicz 1992) and at various nuclear bases across Europe,
with Greenham Common camp in the UK remaining the earliest, largest, and
most well-known example (Cook and Kirk 1983; Roseneil 1995, 2000;
Hipperson 2005). Several basic discourses about gender and nuclear
weapons helped structure this wave of mobilization. Such plurality has
already been noted by academic commenta¬tors beyond IR: In the course of
Hugh Gusterson\'s eth¬nography of the Livermore nuclear weapons
laboratory and protests against it (1996:212-3), Roseneil\'s (1995):
4-7) analysis of the camp at Greenham, and Helen Lidd¬ington\'s
(1991:6-8) overview of the historical antecedents of British women\'s
peace mobilization, three main narra¬tives are identified, with each
author naming and describ¬ing the three in varying terms. On my reading,
however, six discourses can be distinguished, each giving rise to a
different construction of the antinuclear activist. These discourses can
be labeled, respectively, maternalist, antivi-olence, culturalist,
materialist, cosmopolitan, and cosmo¬logical in character. To begin
with, the maternalist discourse brought the fig¬ure of the
\"Mother-in-Action\" to the fore as the key pro¬tagonist in antinuclear
struggle (e.g., Caldicott 1986:236). Speaking to and from the
reproductive capacities of women, and insisting on the importance of the
caring responsibilities and values traditionally associated with them
(Ruddick 1989), this discourse implied that a nuclear-free world
required the reevaluation, reimagin¬ing, and extension of maternal
values and practices, and the displacement of their masculine
corollaries (Caldicott 1986:241-2). It thus provided a positive
justification for women-led or women-only organizing, encouraging those
who had previously been marginalized because of their association with
caring responsibilities to make connec¬tions across the private and
public realm and become a force for broader political change. The
workings of this discourse can be seen in the repeated emphasis placed
on motherhood in explanations given by individuals for their
mobilization (Roseneil 2000:46, 56-9; Pettit 2006:24-6); in the
decorative and symbolic use of photo¬graphs of and drawings by children
at protest events (Cook and Kirk 1983:31; Pershing 1996:128-9); and in
the revitalization and reworking in activist circles of crafts
associated with white, middle-class feminine domesticity such as
embroidery (Krasniewicz 1992:60-6; Pershing 1996). One complementary
discourse could be termed antivi¬olence, focused as it was on the
[[problematic masculinity of the mainstream political subject and its
connection to nuclear politics]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here, masculinity
was constructed either as intrinsically pathological or as structurally
corrupted: Either way, [[nuclear weaponry was contextualized on a
continuum of violence perpetrated by men and male-dominated
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}---from rape, through domestic
violence, to war (Held 1988; Russell 1989b). Within the terms of this
discourse, the [[roots of violence were located in male
sexuality]{.underline}]{.mark} and an associated drive to dom¬inate
women, nonwhites, and nature (Kokopeli and La-key 1982:233, 235-8;
Easlea 1983), and/or to a larger system or structure of \"patriarchy\"
(Warnock 1982; Zanotti 1982), both explanations bearing witness to the
influence of radical feminist analyses (Koen and Swaim 1980:1; Roseneil
1995:6-7; 2000:34). Although it was pri¬marily concerned to critique
pronuclear male subjectiv¬ity, this discourse had the effect of
elevating existing models of femininity and womanhood, providing as it
did a negative justification for women-only organizing against the bomb
(Held 1988; Rosenbluth and Russell 1989:302-5). A generalized figure of
the \"Woman\" became by default the bearer of antinuclear struggle, [[a
world without nuclear weapons requir]{.underline}ing]{.mark} variously
the [[feminization of male psychology]{.underline}, [the overthrow of
male power and patriarchal structures by
wom]{.underline}]{.mark}[en]{.underline}, or even limi¬tations on the
numbers of men born into the world (Gearhart 1982). The culturalist
discourse, in contrast, had a distinctive emphasis on the cultural
construction of hegemonic male and female subjects and the need for and
possibility of challenging both. This discourse again positioned
patriar¬chy as the structural context in which nuclear weaponry gained
its symbolic resonance, but there was also some consideration here of
the ways in which patriarchy over¬lapped with and was constituted by
power relations such as heterosexism and racism (Smith 1989). This
enabled the articulation of a more complex, intersectional cri¬tique of
the ways in which dominant forms of masculinity underpinned and fed into
Cold War nuclearism (see e.g., Hartsock 1989; Spretnak 1989; Strange
1989). It also allowed for an avowedly feminist \"queering\" of dominant
models of femininity (as embodied, for example, in maternal tropes and
their association with middle-class, white, heterosexual respectability)
and advocacy of alter-native ways of being (Snitow 1989; Roseneil 2000:
chap¬ters 7 and 10). Overall, the discourse hinged on the construction
of the \"Reflexive Activist,\" whose critical self-examination and
insistence on the stratified, change¬able character of gender, was
positioned as central to the struggle for change. As Gusterson
(1996:212) indicates, culturalist arguments pointed ultimately to a
vision of the postnuclear world as \"androgynous,\" with gender
differ¬ence no longer playing a politically meaningful role. The fourth
discourse was materialist in character, emphasizing the impact of
nuclear weapons and their cost. Widespread in the antinuclear movement
(Roseneil 1995:5), when circulating in and through women\'s activ¬ism,
this discourse was frequently typified by a preoccupa¬tion with the
impact of nuclear weapons on female bodies and lives. The implications
for the reproductive system of exposure to radiation were highlighted,
for example (Koen and Swaim 1980), or the deleterious effects on health,
education, and welfare budgets of pri¬oritizing spending on weaponry
(Beneria and Blank 1989; Omolade 1989). Gender figured in this discourse
as dif¬ferential embodiment and lived social roles rather than as an
identity or form of power. But, gender was also interpolated in a more
abstract way, in terms of a repeated emphasis on the impact and cost of
nuclear weapons on human bodies, relationships, and the natural world.
The abstractions of nuclear rationality, as pursued by a technocratic,
Western, masculine subject, were thus confronted by the concrete,
embodied mode of reason¬ing historically associated with feminine (and
also non¬white, non-Western) subjectivity, but here assumed to be more
widely shared (Buirski 1983; Pettit 1983). In this way, the discourse
constructed a feminized but potentially inclusive figure of the
antinuclear activist we could call the \"Empath.\" A very different tack
was taken in the cosmopolitan dis-course, which focused on women\'s
political exclusion from the defense and political establishments of the
nuclear state. Epitomized in British author Virginia Woolf s antiwar
rallying cry from an earlier age---\"As a woman I have no country. As a
woman I want no country. As a woman my country is the whole
world\"---this dis-course was rearticulated in the Cold War period by
radi¬cal feminists who, assuming an undifferentiated commonality of
experience of oppression among women worldwide, aspired to a global
sisterhood rather than entry into male-dominated institutions.\" The
sense of sisterly connection can be seen, for example, in accounts of
the international character of Greenham and the soli¬darity actions that
took place around the world (Cook and Kirk 1983:32, 62), as well as in
critiques of the loyal¬ties and symbols of mainstream patriotism in both
the UK and United States (e.g., Krasniewicz 1992:chapter 8). In
addition, security was reenvisioned within the parame¬ters of this
discourse in ways that made it more inclusive of women\'s experiences
and transborder relationships. Militarism and the supposed protection it
offered were subjected to critical scrutiny (Ruehl 1983; Thompson 1983;
Wood 1983); the counterproductive character of violence was documented
(Cook and Kirk 1983); and empathetic connections were forged with the
ostensibly threatening \"Other\" (Porter 1983; Mooney 1983:5, 14). In
such ways, this discourse reconfigured community and the methods used to
protect it, rather than gender. It effectively contrasted a compromised
male political sub¬ject in the form of the citizen or politician to an
ethical female subject, the \"Sister,\" who transcended geopoliti¬cal
specificities. Finally, the cosmological discourse mobilized gendered
imagery as part of its holistic conception of the universe and the role
of humans within it. In its ecological variant, this discourse drew on a
self-conscious ecofeminism (Epstein 1991:176-8; Alonso 1993:246-7) and
was mani¬fested in claims about women\'s connectedness to the nat¬ural
world (Salamone 1982; Women\'s Pentagon Action 1982), in critiques of a
dualistic masculine worldview involving separation from and mastery over
nature (Grif¬fin 1989; Strange 1989), and in the images of nature
pep¬pering women\'s life stories, poetry, and other texts (Linton and
Whitham 1989:186; Pettit 2006:24, 27). In its spiritual variant (Epstein
1991:chapter 5), the discourse gave rise to widespread Goddess
iconography (McAllister 1982:ix; Jones 1989:201) and pagan/wiccan
narratives and rituals (Epstein 1991:183-92; Krasniewicz 1992:53-60).
The antinuclear activist was constituted here as a potent feminine
figure, either \"Earth Mother\" or \"Goddess,\" and urged to exert her
powers to usher in an alternative future for the planet. Although it is
helpful analytically to delineate these six basic discourses about
gender and (anti)nuclear politics in Cold War women\'s activism, they
and the identities they constructed should not be misunderstood as
inter¬nally monolithic and sharply distinct from each other in their
empirical instantiation. To begin with, the dis¬courses were internally
heterogeneous and conflictual. There were rival articulations of a
cosmological frame¬work, as I have shown, and also of maternalism, with
women\'s caring capacity rooted sometimes in biologically determinist
accounts of their physiology and thereby seen 13 Which is why I think
Liddington is incorrect to label this discourse \"equal rights.\" as
eternal (Caldicott 1986), sometimes in their socially constructed caring
roles and thereby envisioned as chang¬ing and changeable (Ruddick
1989).14 Moreover, the boundaries between discourses were permeable.
Thus, cosmological visions resonated with maternalism in their
reimagining of femininity while, to take another example, the
[[antiviolence and culturalist discourses both pointed toward
patriarch]{.mark}y]{.underline} as the structural context in which men
and masculinity gained their power and women and femi¬ninity were
subordinated and oppressed. Finally, even the most divergent discourses
were not indelibly associated with antithetical political projects and
political subjects, but rather offered overlapping and competing sources
of meaning-making and identity construction within the same action or
text. This is made very clear in detailed ethnographies of the women\'s
peace camps (Krasniewicz 1992; Roseneil 1995, 2000). As I will show in
the next part of the article, instability, porousness, and simultane¬ity
continue to characterize the six discourses as they have recirculated in
the post-Cold War period, along with some notable shifts in content and
in the activist identi¬ties thereby produced.

#### We solve the Aff's impacts \-- the core value of feminism is pacifism and the end of war. Hegemonic masculinity is key to violence.

[The position of women condemning war as mothers has been the subject of
much debate among feminists]{.underline}, a debate that probably traces
its roots to old discussions of equality and difference feminism and
interpretations of the roles of women within the family. Sara Ruddick
and Jean Bethke Elshtain are among the pro-family feminists who have
theorized about pacifist feminism (Elshtain, 1985; Ruddick, 1983).
[Ruddick proposed that "maternal thinking," a way of being in the world
based on the concept of "preservative love," could present a counter
ideology to a male dominated culture.]{.underline} Moreover, maternal
thinking is not unique to women, nor to mothers, as both men and women
and those without children can adopt a nurturing disposition and be
socialized into maternal thinking (Ruddick, 1983). For this pacifist
feminist, maternal thinking would represent the antithesis of violent
masculinity. While opposed to war, Ruddick believes that there is no
contradiction between being a feminist and defending the right of women
to participate in the military, while at the same adopting a pacifist
philosophy. [In fact, the incorporation of women in the military as
conscripts---not volunteers---could help to "pacify the forces," as long
as many of these women would help introduce maternal thinking.
Moreover:]{.underline}

*We acknowledge the existence of good causes and the necessity of some
battles but claim that there are entirely or principally nonviolent ways
of fighting them that are at least as effective as violence (the
effectiveness of which is always exaggerated) and that these nonviolent
solutions cost less morally, physically, and psychologically.2 *

For Jean Elshtain (1985), while most feminists agree on the gendered
nature of war and militarism, the majority of them support a realist or
its modified version "just war theory" posture, both of which accept war
as a legitimate or justifiable political instrument. This well-known
proponent of peace feminist thought has critiqued realist feminists and
just war theory feminists for failing to present a challenge to the
Western discourse of war and politics. According to her provocative
argument, feminists must not dismiss all notions of traditional
femininity, such as maternal thinking. Instead they must appropriate
these images and transform them (Elshtain, 1985). Simultaneously, she
also criticizes cultural feminists who assume--- consciously or not---a
"just war theory" position. Just war theory traces its roots to St.
Augutine's Christian political thought, which argued for the
justification of war in some cases using a gendered imagery that
represented women as "beautiful souls" in need of protection and men as
chivalric "just warriors." [According to Elshtain, many cultural
feminists who invoke the "female principle" as ontologically superior to
masculinism continue the Augustian tradition of the beautiful
soul.]{.underline} While rejecting these romanticized images of
femininity, Elshtain also accuses the feminist movement of being
"matrophobic" and attempts to restructure political consciousness based
upon the implications of "maternal thinking" in a new kind of feminist
political thought that she calls "social feminism" (Elshtain, 1985).
This position is at odds with that espoused by first wave feminists
--Kate Millen, Betty Friedan, Juliet Michell, Shulamith Fireston and
others---who had sought to demystify the family and motherhood in order
to achieve equality with men. Indeed, the role of women in the family
continues to be the subject of much controversy within the feminist
movement (Dietz, 1985). Mary Dietz points out some of the pitfalls of
the maternal thinking argument: 

*Women who do not venture beyond the family or participate in practices
beyond mothering cannot attain an adequate understanding of the way
politics determines their own lives. Nor can they --as mothers or
creatures of the family---help transform a politics that stands in
conflict with maternal values. The only consciousness that can serve as
a basis for this transformation and so for the sort of active citizenry
that Elshtain wishes to promote is a distinctly political consciousness
steeped in a commitment to democratic values, participatory citizenship
and egalitarianism3 . *

[Mary Dietz and other "civic" feminist scholars advocate the peace
politics of feminism but disavow its connections to motherhood and
maternal thinking. In their opinion, it is feminist political
consciousness rather than femaleness or mothering that makes women more
pacific.]{.underline} Hence, both female and male feminists should be
more inclined towards pacifism. Nonetheless, the fact that women are
more likely to be feminists explains the gender gap on attitudes towards
war (Cook and Wilcox, 1991; Dietz 1985). 

#### Communication strategies of the cyberfeminist virtual community with the most popular feminist groups.

[Changes in Internet technologies]{.underline}, [significant shifts in
political discourse, the transformation of feminism itself will force to
take a fresh look at cyberfeminism.]{.underline} Donna Haraway's classic
"**[cyborg feminism]{.underline}**" was criticized and even considered
an **["antifeminist" direction]{.underline}** \[9\]. 

The modern cyberfeminism is no longer a monolithic movement on western
society. J. Danilels says that more accurate to refer to the plural,
"cyberfeminism(s)" \[1\]. [Old cyberfeminism gives way to new
cyberfeminism(s) and networked feminism(s). ]{.underline}

[The large number of "cyberfeminism]{.underline}(s)" or "**[networked
feminism]{.underline}**(s)" means that separate groups on the Internet
will [use different communication strategies in order to achieve their
goals. ]{.underline}

I[n Russia the cybefeminist movement started in 1995, but it has not
become really noticeable yet.]{.underline} However, the cyberfeminist
community still exists and is quite active on the social network
VKontakte. [In connection with the of global cyberfeminism
transformation, it is interesting to study the communication and
discursive strategies of Russian cyberfeminism in comparison with other
Russian virtual communities of networked feminists.]{.underline}

## Impact

#### Hegemonic masculinity leads to militarization, dehumanization, and expansion. These cause war and mass violence.  

**Wojnicka 22**- (Katarzyna, Associate Professor of Sociology,

Studies, "*NORMA, Volume 17, Issue 2 (2022),* Publisher: Taylor &
Francis Online)

[Ukrainians awoke on the 24th of February 2022 to find themselves in a
conflict over which many had been dreading]{.underline} but which almost
as many had also thought impossible. Putin's invasion of Ukraine has
also meant that we, non-Ukrainian Europeans, find ourselves in a time in
which the term 'crisis' has taken on a much more direct presence. After
over 20 years in which the so-called 'War on Terror' wrought death and
destruction
'elsewhere',[1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/18902138.2022.2069856)
the actual conflict between sovereign nation-states, with the prospect
of spilling over into yet another European war involving multiple
nation-states is now a reality. T[he horrors of war are happening closer
to our own countries than many of us have experienced in our
lifetimes.]{.underline}

[The gender dynamics of the invasion of Ukraine are impossible to
ignore.]{.underline} War re-installs gendered demarcation lines that
many of us, naively, thought was a relic from the past. [Masculinity is
mobilized as a rhetorical figure and symbolic resource in the brutal
reality for all these young men and women that have to go into a war
declared by older men. In the character of the fascist strongman who has
become a cult figure in the global far-right, we can see someone who has
been valued at home and abroad precisely for his compensatory
masculinism (Löffler, Luyt, & Starck,]{.underline}
[2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/18902138.2022.2069856)[)
as well as ridiculed in Western media (Wiedlack,]{.underline}
[2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/18902138.2022.2069856)[).]{.underline}
Then there is the resilient, David-esque figure who has been championed
for his intransigence and refusal to give up in the face of
insurmountable odds. Caught in-between these political leaders are the
military conscripts of all genders who are putting their lives at risk,
as well as women and children who are being forced to flee as a result
of imperialist aggression. [On social media, people are celebrating the
loss of human life and glorifying militarist responses from political
leaders whilst those of us in Finland and Sweden find ourselves closer
to NATO membership than at any point during our intertwined
histories.]{.underline} It is a new formative moment that most of us
wish could have been avoided.

We at NORMA have been sickened and appalled by what we have all seen in
the last 2 months. [Critical studies on men and masculinities could not
be more relevant for analyzing the intentions and the appeal of
political leaders as well as the consequences of their
decisions.]{.underline} Two of NORMA's recent special issues were
focused on political masculinities and militarized masculinities but
neither we, the editors, nor possibly the special issue editors
(Christensen & Kyed,
[2022](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/18902138.2022.2069856);
Löffler et al.,
[2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/18902138.2022.2069856))
could have foreseen how timely these related issues would be. [Indeed,
militarism and the responses to militarism *must* be understood in terms
of characteristics we tend to ascribe to
masculinity/masculinities.]{.underline} As Christensen and Kyed
([2022](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/18902138.2022.2069856),
p. 1) highlight ['the male soldier, represented as the hero and the
warrior, is one of the most fundamental representations of masculinity'
(see also Enloe,]{.underline}
[2000](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/18902138.2022.2069856)[).]{.underline}
We see this playing out today in constant coverage of the invasion as
well as in the portrayal of political leaders in the years prior.

In the last decade, a handful of social scholars analyzing the nexus
between [Putin's masculinity and his governance style have come to an
agreement that he represents 'an alpha male in the international
arena']{.underline} (Romanets,
[2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/18902138.2022.2069856)),
a [radical version of hypermasculinity, machismo or masculinist type of
gender performance (Novitskaya,]{.underline}
[2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/18902138.2022.2069856)[,
p. 160), which eventually can be described as a perfect example of
hegemonic masculinity (Connell,]{.underline}
[2005](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/18902138.2022.2069856)[).
This is exemplified in the images of Putin presenting physical strength,
e.g. portraying him as stripped to the waist while riding a horse and
being captured on film while engaged in typical 'male' activities such
as fishing, riding a Harley-Davidson, playing hockey, operating a
firefighter's helicopter, fighter jet or shooting, as well as doing judo
(Romanets,]{.underline}

These, combined with his hyper-heterosexuality, unlimited power over
Russian society, as well as the need to subordinate all others (men,
women and children) leave few doubts, that not only he can be seen as a
typified personification of hegemonic masculinity but also that this
particular type of gender ideology is one of the main factors that have
led to the current invasion of Ukraine. According to Riabov and Riabova
([2014](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/18902138.2022.2069856)),
[Putin's regime is based on creating images of national masculinity and
attributing masculine characteristics to the country, where
militarization and heterosexualisation are the most profiled elements,
and their ultimate embodiment have been Russian 'war with terrorism'

[[We turn to feminist geopolitics to understand the embodied and
everyday workings of the state, borders, and political ideology]{.mark},
and how bodies and the most intimate aspects of life are deeply
geopolitical]{.underline}.1 Recent research has analyzed, for instance,
the ways that differently valued bodies are counted or uncounted
(Hyndman 2007), violence of war spills into domestic violence (Pain
2015), the idea of the nation impinges on the bodies of ordinary people
traveling through their daily lives (Fluri 2011), and the "war on drugs"
comes home (Massaro 2015). This scholarship builds on well-established
work on embodied nationalism that demonstrates how [[the nation is
racialized and gendered to justify violent masculinity in its
defense]{.mark}.2 [Its focus on the political emergence of a violent
masculinity as dominant complements theories of masculinity]{.mark},
[specifically]{.mark} R. W. Connell's (1987) conceptualization of
[hegemonic masculinity as an idealized form that regulates and shapes
the range of masculinities possible within a
society]{.mark}]{.underline} (see also Connell and Messerschmidt 2005).
Linking embodied nationalism to emergent hegemonic forms of violent
masculinity deepens the analysis provided by ethnographies and oral
histories that center the lived and gendered experience of such
violence.3 At the same time, this research contributes to [geographies
of masculinities that emphasize multiple, fluid, and relational
production of masculinities that are influenced by the political,
racial, gendered, religious, and class dynamics of specific localities,
as well as global discourses and geopolitical strategies]{.underline}.4
Peter Hopkins's (2008) work, for example, shows how the US-led war on
terror has deeply impacted the formation of youthful Muslim
masculinities and their everyday lives in Scotland, while Claire Dwyer,
Bindi Shah, and Gurchathen Sanghera (2008) analyze the effects of the
transformation of South Asian Muslim men's image, from "cricket lover"
to "terror suspect" in in the post--September 11 United Kingdom.
[[Feminist political geography has been especially effective in noting
theways that a national sense of insecurity is generated by political
actors to]{.underline} shore up agendas]{.mark}, while human security is
simultaneously undermined.5 Here, we train our eyes on embodied life as
the site where nationalist and geopolitical conflicts are constituted
through webs of affective relationships and mark certain bodies as
threatening and fearsome. Barbara Spackman's (1996) work on fascist
virilities and Klaus Theweleit's (1987) work on [[male fantasies point
to a relationship between the politics of strongmen and gendered
narratives around the creation of masculinity and the risks of the
feminine.]{.mark} [Theweleit connects military masculinity with
violence, specifically fear-based hatred of women and
femininity]{.mark}]{.underline} in the fantasies of the Freikorps, a
volunteer army that fought internal revolution in interwar Germany. Many
of the Freikorps would go on to Nazi leadership. In their narratives,
Theweleit finds that [[female figures are the object of violence but
violence that is imagined to be self-defense and linked to fears of
dissolution---of society, of one's own masculinity, and of the prospect
of being overwhelmed, softened, dissolved. It is a masculinity that is
both hard and violent but also quite fragile]{.mark}8]{.underline}. As
Sara Ahmed (2004, 33) suggests, "the normative subject is often secured
through narratives of injury: the white male subject, for example, has
become an injured party in national discourses, \... as the one who has
been hurt by the opening up of the nation to others." The spread of this
discourse is facilitated by the majority male subject's access to
resources and thus access to "the capacity to mobilise narratives of
injury within the public domain" (33). [[The need for both the strong
masculine figure and the victim narrative means that the figures to be
protected are majority women; this enables men to both claim injury (to
"their" women) but also claim the position of the strong though
embattled savior]{.mark}.]{.underline} In these rhetorical moves,
demographic fever dreams provide a similar fantasy world to fulfill the
logics critiqued by scholars above, by rewriting histories and futures
with majority figures centered as the true protagonists of history. The
stories told by white nationalists in the United States and Europe, by
Hindu nationalists in India, and by Erdoğan's espousal of a vigorous and
modern Sunni youth are stories in which the chaotic diversity of a
multicultural [world and the messiness of women and femininity are both
backdrop and adversary [in a story line centering strength and the
masculine hero as the true protagonists of all stories.]{.mark} Here,
the centering of one man as savior is not a fluke, a distraction, or a
sideshow but is critical to the functioning of the dream.]{.underline}

#### **Traits associated with masculinity are glorified and encouraged in military institutions, specifically violence**

First, two key works have influenced the development of the concept of
militarised masculinity and masculinities, and I acknowledge the
specific contribution of two scholars. First Enloe has encouraged
scholars to pay attention to the process of militarisation rather than
focus narrowly on the ideology of militarism in her ground-breaking work
on gender and international relations (Enloe 1991). In this work, [Enloe
develops further her concept of military masculinity when thinking about
the ways in which [military institutions are sites of the production of
both culture and gende]{.mark}r. Here she suggests that gender roles are
given opportunity and space to play out, as well as to produce
extremes\-\--hyper military masculinity being one example. She also
points to the ways in which [certain forms of martiality]{.mark}
(exclusively [associated with men]{.mark}) [is hyper-valued]{.mark}
within most societies [and]{.mark} how [this contributes to the
glorification of men's participation in violence and
war]{.mark}.]{.underline} In thinking about military masculinity, it is
not surprising then that feminist scholars such as Enloe, began to think
about the process of socialising that takes place in militarised
settings (Enloe 1983, 2000). [Thus the social, constructed, contingent,
fluid and multiple ways in which individuals are produced as gendered
subjects, given a prescribed set of gendered roles, and how those
individuals identify themselves, and perform gender within military
institutions and settings has been afforded critical
attention]{.underline} (Enloe 2000, Whitworth 2004, Higate 2003; Parpart
2015; Zalewski and Parpart 1998; Belkin 2012). Early conceptualisations
of military masculinity focussed almost exclusively on formal military
settings\-\--that is on national and state militaries. In general,
military masculinity tends to be utilised in a range of feminist
scholarship as a 'thing' that is carried, possessed or produced as an
object through military socialisation and found within military culture
(except Enloe 2003). As such, it was seen, in the early inception, as a
singular form of gendered practice\-\--following on from Connell's early
conceptualisations of hegemonic masculinity (Connell 1987, 1995, 2005).
Of course the ways in which military masculinity has evolved as a
conceptual lens and a site for empirical research means that there is no
single definition, nor is it confined to feminist theorists alone.
[[Military institutions now consistently analyse their own gendered and
racialised cultures]{.mark}\-\--although very often this is for
improving efficiency and effectiveness in military
operations.]{.underline} Further theorisations include that of Dudink,
Hagemann and Tosh (2004) Parpart and Zalewski (2008) Belkin (2012),
Whitworth (2004); Masters (2005); and Duncanson (2009, 2013, 2015).
However, it was [Paul Higate's edited collection (2003) that took up the
challenge of further theorising military masculinity. In particular the
work engages with Connell and other [masculinity scholars and succeeded
in pluralising militarised masculinity]{.mark}. This work expanded the
concept in such a way [that scholars no longer talked about masculinity
within military settings as something culturally specific,]{.mark}
socially entrenched, pathological, or always already there in the same
form[\-\-- rather]{.mark} Higate's collection emphasises at [how]{.mark}
[men \[sic\] become 'manly' warriors through twin processes of gender
and military socialisation]{.mark}]{.underline} (ed. Higate 2003). The
2003 collection suggests that it is difficult to simply place the
military and masculinity (in an additive way) together\-\--rather both
are mutually constituting. At times, in analyses it is difficult to
pinpoint which is more influential\-\-- military culture or gender
culture! Importantly, Higate's collection began to pave the way for
thinking about militarised masculinities in non-traditional contexts.
Thus, work on masculinity amongst rebel groups, militias, gangs, thugs,
terrorists and jihadis began to be developed within this sub-field (Amar
2013; Rommell 2016). This challenged the idea that military values only
belonged to fields where there was a formal military setting. More
contemporary work is concerned with the drone operator, the military
lawyer, the conscious objector and so on (Tidy 2015, 2015a). These two
tracks of argument have been absolutely crucial to the conceptualisation
and use of the term militarised masculinity/masculinities. This is
because militarised masculinities mean that the fluid nature of
militarisation and masculine socialisation in these frames allows
scholars to focus on masculinities in practice and discourse. Rather
than using militarised masculinity as an explanation for various
negative developments within military settings, scholars are encouraged
to probe deeper into what militarised masculinities look like and how
they come into being. For example, [in Stern and Ericsson-Baaz's study
of perpetrators of sexual violence, they focus on the discourses of
perpetrators of sexual violence in the DRC construct as to their
different motivations for such acts of brutality (Ericsson-Baaz and
Stern 2012). In their research, they pay attention to the [narrative
strategies used by men to construct and produce themselves as fearsome
and honourable military men despite admitting to being part of the
perpetration of violence]{.mark}. Similarly, Lomsky-Feder and Rappoport
in their work on models of masculinity in the Israeli context
demonstrate the influence of nation on men's different constructions of
masculin]{.underline}ity (Lomsky-Feder and Rappoport 2003). Lomsky-Feder
and Rappoport view masculinities as being produced hierarchically in one
military context, and as being influenced by very different military
experiences (Russia and Israel). [Both of these [scholars' use of
militarised masculinity provide us with a more complex account of what
motivates men to commit violence (organised or otherwise) in certain
contexts, rather than]{.mark} assuming that it is [merely an unintended
consequence or unintentional by product of male embodiment or male sex
roles and military culture]{.mark}. Thus the work of Cynthia Enloe in
challenging understandings of militarisation, and Higate's edited
collection on militarised masculinities was a catalyst for rethinking
military masculinities and masculinities in conflict (Kirby and Henry
2012). This is turn led to the development of work examining a range of
masculinities within militarised (and not only military) settings---in
particular Belkin's work Bring Me Men, was seminal in challenging the
idea that [military masculinity is a singular and homogenous outcome of
military socialisation and/or military culture and that it is always
constructed in opposition to femininity and/or
heteronormativity]{.mark}. Titinuk's challenge to narrow definitions of
military masculinity (2012) went some way to challenge any tendency
towards simplistic or pathological definitions by demonstrating [that
military organisations]{.mark} also [revere various personal
characteristics traditionally associated with femininity such as
sacrifice, compassion and cooperation]{.mark}. Thus [militarised
masculinities are not constructed purely on the disavowal of all that is
feminine or associated with women]{.mark}]{.underline}. This led to two
further developments. The first was a minor interest in female military
masculinities (Tasker 2011). [Tasker used the portrayal of female
soldiers in Hollywood films to reconceptualise military masculinity
without the male body\-\--influenced by Halberstam's work on female
masculinities more generally (Halberstam 1998). Tasker takes
Halberstam's conceptualisation of non-normative gender and sexuality is
applied to female soldiers who are depicted as occupying a parodic,
mimicking or inauthentic military]{.underline} masculinity. In the films
Courage Under Fire and GI Jane, [Tasker finds [evidence of military
masculine space where women are able to perform gender in both
conventional and unconventional ways]{.mark}. Actress Demi Moore, for
example, labours to shed her 'femininity' by shaving her head and
wearing an undershirt traditionally seen as men's attire, in order to be
accepted as a legitimate soldier. Moore's character is finally accepted
as a legitimate man amongst her male military peers, after she
demonstrates her ability to be 'just like the men' in her squad. This
work contests the scope of military masculinities by insisting not only
on their plurality, but by questioning the very constitution and
production of masculinity as a social expression of gender. The other
development is found in work examining both military femininity (Ombati
2015) and masculinity, as Dietrich does in her 2012 piece on
militarisation in Peru, El Salvador and Colombia. This work, along with
that of scholars such Myrttinen (2013); Parpart (2016); Maringira (2015)
and Stachowitsch (2015) begins to pay attention to internal differences
and inequalities amongst men. What these more recent works suggest is
that the study of militarised masculinities has expanded considerably
and draws on a range of concepts and theories.]{.underline} This is why
it is unsurprising that intersectionality has appeared in the
literature. Masculinity scholars have looked towards feminist theory for
some time now, and in order to understand the complex theoretical
terrain of military and militarised masculinities, scholars have turned
to 'classic' texts, including that by Crenshaw and other intersectional
theorists. As such, it is not surprising that the intersectional 'turn'
should now make headway within the study of men, masculinities and the
military

#### Masculine imagery ensures nuclear priesthood -- causes the normalization of nuclear use

Gender [[scholars have demonstrated how masculinity affects foreign
policy]{.underline}]{.mark} planning and decision making among security
elites and small advisory groups as well as sub-state militias. Though
it does not explore the group\'s dynamics, Carol Cohn s classic
[[investigation of Cold War defense intellectuals demonstrates the
importance of masculine club mentality]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
\"[[nuclear priesthood\" of men charged with crafting U.S. nuclear
strateg]{.mark}y]{.underline} shared a language of abstraction and
[[masculine imagery]{.mark} that [normalized, sanitized]{.mark}, [and
legitimized the discussion of mass killing]{.mark}, [leaving them
detached from the realities of the potential use of nuclear
weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline}39 Relatedly, Robert Dean shows how
President Kennedy surrounded himself with elite advisors who were shaped
by and drew upon institutionalized ideals of masculinity to form a
privileged \"brotherhood.\" These gendered ideals intersected
significantly with class: the exclusively male boarding schools these
men had attended were seen by parents as paths to help their sons
overcome upper-class effeminacy. The Executive Committee of the National
Security Council (ExComm), the elite all-male group of national security
advisors Kennedy gathered to manage the Cuban Missile Crisis in Oc tober
1962, was an assembly of warrior-intellectuals credentialed through the
process of passing through such boarding schools, Ivy League
fraternities, and clubs; validated by voluntary military service; and
mentored by men \"connected across generations by institutional ties of
patronage, class tradition, education, and fraternalism\" and \"bound
together by a common conception of patrician \'manliness\' and
heroism.\"4 A focus on the role of masculinity within another type of
small group, autonomous nationalist militias such as the ones that
participated in [[sexual violence]{.mark}
[atrocities]{.mark}]{.underline} committed in Bosnia in the 1990s, or
more recently in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), [[reveals the
roles of masculine hierarchies and frustrations related to unachievable
and idealized militarized masculinity]{.underline}]{.mark}. Enloe\'s
analysis of interviews conducted with men accused of raping and kill ing
Bosnian Muslim women in the 1990s revealed hierarchies among Serbian
militia, illustrating how systematic rape during wartime is \"fueled\"
by inter-male relations.41 Members of militia groups in the DRC were
asked to explain the way they justified and normalized sexual violence.
Their answers relied upon logics derived from discourses of masculinity
and femininity, inculcated in part by the institutional promotion of
ideals, such as the \"(hetero)sexually potent male fighter,\" that code
certain types of rape as inevitable and a result of the sexual needs of
the soldiers, while others are seen as less legitimate deviant
expressions of frustrations due to wartime circumstances.42 These
soldiers \"explicitly their rationale for rape with their inabilities
(or \'failures\') to inhabit certain idealized notions of heterosexual
manhood,\" including that of the eco provider, seen as legitimately
dominant in their households.43 Sub-state Bureaucracies and
Organizations Militaries are among the most significant domestic-level
organizations and have been a prominent focus of gender and masculinity
research. Feminist IR scholarship has highlighted \"the way the
[[military functions in our societies]{.underline}\] [as a central
guarantor and producer of masculinity]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"44 The
tenuousness of the [military\'s production of official masculine
legitimacy is signaled by military efforts to exclude gay and female
soldiers using ostensible morale and unit cohesion concerns to
camouflage anxieties over \"maintaining the institution\'s heterosexual
masculinity]{.underline}.\"45 The dependence of military organizations
and bureaucracies on the con struction of a variety of military
masculinities is evident from their recruitment strategies and
organizational structures. There is a complex relationship between
militarism, masculinity, and military recruitment strategies.46 Melissa
T. Brown ™ discusses the variety of masculine constructions underwriting
American military recruitment campaigns in the wake of the end of the
draft and inception of the all-volunteer force. Brown argues that
recruitment materials for the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force evoke
varied masculinity types, not just traditional war rior masculinity,
tailoring their appeals to meet particular recruitment targets depending
on the branches\' needs for combat-related or technical skills, for
women and military careerists, or for larger or smaller numbers of
recruits.47 The importance of masculinity extends beyond the recruiting
stage to the organization of state militaries, distinct from the
smaller, non-state militias - \... . discussed previously. Connell has
argued that internal masculine hierarchies, "physically violent but
subordinate to orders on the one hand, and dominating and
organizationally competent on the other\" are foundational to military
organization.48 In these organizations, occupational status and career
advancement cannot be disentangled from the operation of masculinity.
This is seen, for example, in the way U.S. Navy personnel draw upon
different elements of a menu of masculine qualities to navigate the
branch\'s competitive atmosphere and advance their careers. Lower-status
supply officers (tasked with administration, inventory, and accounting),
who are excluded from the risk-taking behavior and autonomy reserved for
high-status pilots and Naval aviators, distinguish themselves by
emphasizing the professionalized technical rationality, efficiency, and
responsibility in their roles.49 Pressure on these officers is
attenuated by the Navy\'s organizational culture of constant evaluation
and competitive testing that demands officers continually demonstrate
their masculinity and avoid acquiring a reputation for failure. This
masculine competition has spillover effects outside the organization.
According to the Department of Defenses \"Tailhook Report\" issued in
1993, Navy members\' notorious behavior (including the sexual ha
rassment and assault of female naval officers) in a convention hotel was
also an outgrowth of competition between units of the Navy.50 At this
level, IR scholars typically focus on the impact of the internal
workings of the nation-state, including factors such as domestic
politics, the character of a state\'s political-economic system (or
regime type such as democratic or authori tarian), culture, nationalism,
the role of interest groups, and public opinion. The number of powerful
critiques concerning security and the state provided by feminists is too
voluminous to summarize.51 Relative to the volume of main stream
scholarship on the state level, feminists have paid less attention to
the possible relationship between gender and the democratic peace---the
influential thesis that democracies rarely fight other democracies but
can be quite belligerent in their dealings with non-democracies. Thus,
feminists left it to non-feminists such as Francis Fukuyama to
speculate, without evidence, that \"feminized\" de veloped democracies,
where women\'s political participation has expanded, are more peaceful
than authoritarian states, and thus vulnerable to prédations of more
masculinized states.52 Feminists have, however, problematized both this
posited relationship between women and peace and the common link between
alleged peacefulness of democratization and women\'s political
participation.53 Like feminists, [masculinity theorists have noted that
the [institutions that make up the state have been subject to male
domination and continue to remain so]{.mark}. The [link]{.mark} [between
nationhood and manhood and the centrality of masculinity to nationalism
are stressed by masculinity scholars who point to the value nationalist
movements place on terms such as honor, bravery, cowardice, duty, and
patriotism]{.mark}]{.underline}, which \"are hard to distinguish as
either nationalistic or mascu linist, since they seem so thoroughly tied
both to the nation and to manliness. Furthermore, the way nationalist
movements reflect \"a masculinist definition of femininity and of
women\'s proper place in the nation\" relegates women to the roles of
mothers and symbols of national honor.\" At this level, analysis shows
how the operations of masculinity in the domes¬tic political space help
account for various types of state behavior. For example, U.S. gender
dynamics before the Spanish--American war provide a window into the
relationship between gendered domestic political pressures, pre- vailing
notions of masculinity and leadership, and the decision to en-gage in
war. Masculine political culture is a resource for leaders looking to
characterize the threat posed by other states. In the late nineteenth
century, a variety of factors combined to pose a threat to champions of
a \"manly ideal of politics\" and martial conceptions of citizenship.
Such factors included the U.S. political climate at the time, the
depression of 1893, the closing of the Western frontier, and more
assertive, activist female political participation (presaging a possible
feminization of politics).\" For jingos (those advocating for war with
Spain) of the 1890s, the answer to these threats was to go to war as a
way of \"inculcating manhood.\"\" Domestic calls for war to avenge the
sinking of the battleship Maine eventually pressured U.S. President
William McKinley 72 to declare war on Spain, illustrating the extent to
which the president\'s political authority was---and still
is---predicated upon martial masculinity. [[Masculine imagery in a
domestic political culture]{.underline}]{.mark}---including media,
fic-tion, and films---also impacts the evolution of alliance formation
between states. For example, Michelle Mart historicizes the close ties
between the United States and Israel by analyzing cultural constructions
of Israel throughout the 1940s and 1950s.57 Once stereotyped as cowards
and passive victims of the Holocaust, Israeli Jews were reimaged during
the Cold War struggle as masculine insiders worthy of being allies.
Enhanced by Israel\'s military successes, images of Israe¬lis as tough
pioneers, gutsy underdogs, and citizen soldiers were posed against
increasingly unmasculine representations of Arab outsiders in a manner
that enhanced Israel\'s perceived value as a U.S. ally.

#### Hegemonic masculinity sustains historical inequality

Imagination, and Masculinity in Crisis"

[[Traditionally, the study of men has been called 'history', but there
are also intersections between studying men and studying
gender.]{.underline}]{.mark} [For over thirty years[, the study of
gender has encompassed the study of both men and masculinities.]{.mark}
Men and masculinities are shaped by differences of age, class, and
ethnicity, and exist among other social differences]{.underline} (Kimmel
et al., 2005, p. 3). There is also evidence that masculinity can be
transgressed (Beasley, 2015; McGuffey & Rich, 1999; Surkis, 1996;
Tsirigotis, 2017). [However, [toxic masculinity (and, by extension,
duelling) is not transgressive; instead, it adheres to and upholds those
norms.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Masculinity has been the subject of much previous scholarship, and
contemporary masculinity scholarship is heavily influenced by a single
theoretical framework]{.mark} established by Raewyn Connell. Connell's
theory acknowledges that [while masculinities vary across time, culture,
and individuals, there has been a practice]{.mark}]{.underline}
[(**[hegemonic masculinity]{.underline}**) that legitimises men's
position as dominant in society]{.mark} (androcentrism), while
subordinating women and men from marginalised groups (Connell, 1995).
[[Hegemonic masculinity may explain why men maintain positions of
power]{.mark}, because women, marginalised men (those in the LGBTIQA+
community, people of colour, Jewish men, etc.),]{.underline} and those
of other genders are subsequently coded as female or women (Connell,
1995). [An integral part of the continuing appeal of Connell's theory is
that [the theory itself provides a critical feminist analysis of
historically specific masculinities while at the same time recognising
the various extents to which individual men contribute to its
propagation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finally, Connell notes that [hegemonic
masculinity is the currently accepted strategy in human societies,
acknowledging that hegemonic masculinity can be challenged, changed, and
usurped (Connell, 1995).]{.underline}

Some scholars argue that [[the theory behind hegemonic masculinity has
become associated with 'negative characteristics that depict men as
unemotional, independent, nonnurturing, aggressive, and dispassionate',
which are then seen as the causes of criminal behaviour, while ignoring
the 'positive' behaviour of men]{.underline}]{.mark} (Collier, 1998, pp.
1--29). Other scholars criticise [the drift of hegemonic masculinity,
suggesting that any contemporary trouble is now blamed on toxic
masculinity]{.underline} (Martin, 1998). One academic argues that
'defending gun ownership is a defence of hegemonic masculinity' (Martin,
1998, p. 474), an equivalency that may serve as an example of what
Collier (1998) deems an overreach. However, [recent research has
indicated that [there is indeed a connection between hegemonic
masculinity and carrying a concealed firearm, as part of the appeal of
so doing is that it allows the man to identify with hegemonic
masculinity]{.mark} through fantasies of violence, self-defence, or
defending their spouse and/or children (Stroud, 2012, p.
216).]{.underline}

Since, as I have suggested, [the world of international politics is a
masculine domain]{.underline}, how could feminist perspectives
contribute anything new to its academic discourses? Many male scholars
have already noted that, given our [current technologies of
destruction]{.underline} and the high degree of [economic
inequality]{.underline} and [environmental degradation]{.underline} that
now [exists]{.underline}, [we are desperately in need of changes in the
way world politics is conducted]{.underline}; many of them are
attempting to prescribe such changes. For the most part, however, these
[critics have ignored the extent to which the values and assumptions
that drive our contemporary international system are intrinsically
related to concepts of masculinity]{.underline}; privileging these
values constrains the options available to states and their
policymakers. All knowledge is partial and is a function of the
knower\'s lived experience in the world. Since [knowledge about the
behavior of states in the international system depends on assumptions
that come out of men\'s experiences]{.underline}, it
[ignores]{.underline} a large body of [human experience]{.underline}
that has the potential for increasing the range of options and opening
up new ways of thinking about interstate practices. [Theoretical
perspectives]{.underline} that depend on a broader range of human
experience [are important for women and men alike]{.underline}, as we
seek new ways of thinking about our contemporary dilemmas. Conventional
international relations theory has concentrated on the activities of the
great powers at the center of the system. [Feminist
theories]{.underline}, which speak out of the various experiences of
women\-- who are usually on the margins of society and interstate
politics\-- can [offer us some new insights on the behavior of states
and the needs of individuals]{.underline}, particularly those on the
peripheries of the international system. [Feminist
perspectives]{.underline}, constructed out of the experiences of women,
can [add a new dimension to our understanding of the world
economy]{.underline}; since [women ar]{.underline}e frequently the
[first casualties in]{.underline} times of [economic
hardship]{.underline}, we might [also gain]{.underline} some [new
insight]{.underline} [in]{.underline}to [the relationship between
militarism and structural violence]{.underline}. However, [f**eminist
theories**]{.underline} **must [go beyond injecting women\'s
experiences]{.underline} into different disciplines [and attempt to
challenge the core concepts of the disciplines
themselves]{.underline}**. [Concepts central to international
relations]{.underline} theory and practice, such as power, sovereignty,
and security, [have been framed in terms that we associate with
masculinity]{.underline}. Drawing on [feminist theories]{.underline} to
examine and [critique the meaning of these]{.underline} and other
[concepts]{.underline} fundamental to international politics [could help
us to reformulate]{.underline} these [concepts]{.underline} in ways that
might [allow us to see new possibilities]{.underline} for
[solvi]{.underline}ng our [current insecurities]{.underline}. Suggesting
that the personal is political, [feminist scholars]{.underline} have
brought to our attention distinctions between public and private in the
domestic polity: [examining these artificial boundary
distinctions]{.underline} in the domestic polity [could shed new light
on international boundaries]{.underline}, such as those [between anarchy
and order]{.underline}, [which are]{.underline} so [fundamental to the
conceptual framework of realist discourse]{.underline}. Most
[contemporary feminist perspectives take the gender
inequalities]{.underline} that I have described above [as a basic
assumption]{.underline}. Feminists in various disciplines claim that
[feminist theories]{.underline}, by [reveal]{.underline}ing [and
challeng]{.underline}ing these [gender hierarchies]{.underline},
[have]{.underline} the [potential to transform disciplinary
paradigms]{.underline}. By [introducing gender]{.underline}
in[to]{.underline} the discipline of [**I**nternational
**Rel**ations]{.underline}, I hope to [challenge the way]{.underline} in
which [the field has traditionally been constructed]{.underline} and to
[examine]{.underline} the [extent]{.underline} to which [the practices
of international politics are related to these gender
inequalities]{.underline}. The construction of hierarchical binary
oppositions has been central to theorizing about international
relations. 29 Distinctions between domestic and foreign, inside and
outside, order and anarchy, and center and periphery have served as
important assumptions in theory construction and as organizing
principles for the way we view the world. Just as [realists center their
explanations on the hierarchical relations between states and Marxists
on unequal class relations]{.underline}, [feminists]{.underline} [can
bring to light gender hierarchies embedded in the theories and practices
of world politics]{.underline} and [allow us to see the
extent]{.underline} to which [all these systems of domination are
interrelated]{.underline}. As [Sarah Brown argues]{.underline}, a
[feminist theory of international relations is an act of political
commitment to understanding the world from the perspective of the
socially subjugated]{.underline}. \"There is [the need to identify
the]{.underline} as yet [unspecified relation between]{.underline} the
[construction of power and]{.underline} the [construction of gender in
international relations]{.underline}.\" 30 [Acknowledging]{.underline},
as most feminist theories do, [that these hierarchies are socially
constructed]{.underline}, also [allows us to envisage conditions
necessary for their transcendence.]{.underline}

#### Sexism or hegemonic masculinity dominates politics and devalues both femininity\'s values and international relationship in order to sustain gender hierarchical politics. A reformation to politics is needed for liberating females from gender opposition. 

**Tickner 92**   - (J.Ann, Distinguished Scholar in Residence School of
International Service,*"Engendered Insecurities Feminist Perspectives on
International Relations," Gender in International Politics, * New York:
Columbia)                  

[        **   Hegemonic masculinity is sustained through its opposition
to various subordinated and devalued**]{.underline} masculinities, such
as homosexuality, and, more important, through **[its relation to
various devalued femininities]{.underline}**. Socially constructed
gender differences are based on socially sanctioned, unequal
relationships between men and women that reinforce compliance with
men\'s stated superiority. [Nowhere in the public realm are these
stereotypical gender images more apparent than in the realm of
international politics, where the characteristics associated with
hegemonic masculinity are projected onto the behavior of states whose
success as international actors is]{.underline} measured in terms of
their power capabilities and capacity for self-help and autonomy. 

         [ Connell\'s definition of hegemonic masculinity depends on its
opposition to an unequal relationship with various subordinated
femininities.]{.underline} Many contemporary feminists draw on similarly
socially constructed, or engendered, relationships in their definition
of gender difference. Historically, differences between men and women
have usually been ascribed to biology. [But when feminists use the term
gender today, they are not generally referring to biological differences
between males and females, but to a set of culturally shaped and defined
characteristics associated with masculinity and femininity.]{.underline}
These characteristics can and do vary across time and place. In this
view, biology may constrain behavior, but it should not be used
\"deterministically\" or \"naturally\" to justify practices,
institutions, or choices that could be other than they are. While what
it means to be a man or a woman varies across cultures and history, in
most cultures gender differences signify relationships of inequality and
the domination of women by men. 

          Joan Scott similarly characterizes gender as \"a constitutive
element of social relationships based on perceived differences between
the sexes, and\... a primary way of signifying relationships of power.\"
7 Indeed one could characterize most contemporary [feminist scholarship
in terms of the dual beliefs that gender difference has played an
important and essential role in the structuring of social inequalities
in much of human history and that the resulting differences in
self-identifications, human understandings, social status, and power
relationships are unjustified.]{.underline}

           [ Scott claims that **the way in which our understanding of
gender signifies relationships of power is through a set of** normative
concepts that set forth **interpretations of the meanings of
symbols.**]{.underline} In Western culture, [these concepts take the
form of fixed binary oppositions that categorically **assert the meaning
of masculine and feminine and hence legitimize a set of unequal social
relationships.**]{.underline} 8 Scott and many other contemporary
feminists assert that, through our use of language, we come to perceive
the world through these binary oppositions. [Our Western understanding
of gender is based on a set of culturally determined binary
distinctions, such as public versus private, objective versus
subjective, self versus other, reason versus emotion, autonomy versus
relatedness, and culture versus nature; the first of each pair of
characteristics is typically associated with masculinity, the second
with femininity. 9 Scott claims that **the hierarchical construction of
these distinctions can take on a fixed**  and permanent quality that
perpetuates women\'s oppression: therefore they must be
challenged.]{.underline} To do so we must analyze the way these binary
oppositions operate in different contexts and, rather than accepting
them as fixed, seek to displace their hierarchical construction. 10
[When many of these differences between women and men are no longer
assumed to be natural or fixed, we can examine how relations of gender
inequality are constructed and sustained in various arenas of public and
private life.]{.underline} In committing itself to gender as a category
of analysis, contemporary feminism also commits itself to gender
equality as a social goal. 

         [  Extending Scott\'s challenge to the field of **international
relations, we can** immediately **detect a similar set Gender in
association of international politics with the masculine characteristics
described above**]{.underline}, the field of international relations is
one of the last of the social sciences to be touched by gender analysis
and feminist perspectives. 11 [The reason for this, I believe, is not
that the field is gender neutral, meaning that the introduction of
gender is irrelevant to its subject matter as many scholars believe, but
that it **is so thoroughly masculinized that the workings of these
hierarchical gender relations are hidden.**]{.underline}

#### Politicians valorize masculinity in politics and oppress women and feminism. Politics are always seen as masculine.

**Löffler et al. 20** \[Marion, Department of Political Science
University of Vienna, "Political Masculinities and Populism", NORMA\]

[[Politics is most often conceived of as a gender-neutral
practice]{.underline}]{.mark} guided by rationality[.
Y[et]{.underline}]{.mark}[, as is the case more generally in society[,
masculinity operates as a hidden (human) norm structuring
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the 'unmarked' gender category, its
influence has remained hidden from critical enquiry. However, since the
early 1990s[, [a growing body of literature in masculinity studies
generally, and masculinities in politics in particular, has debunked the
myth of the gender-neutrality of politics and made masculinity
visible]{.underline}]{.mark} (see Starck & Sauer, 2014). [As is the case
in masculinity studies, right-wing populist discourse currently refutes
the rational and gender-neutral image of politics. Yet unlike
masculinity studies, masculinity is not open to critical enquiry among
right-wing populists]{.underline}. Rather, [populist
[politicians]{.mark} such as Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin [promote and
valorize the relationship between masculinity and
politics]{.mark}]{.underline} (Boatright & Sperling, 2020; Sperling,
2015). [Newly emerging [versions of right-wing populism have been
described as being misogynist and sexist: they oppose feminism]{.mark}
and [gender-equality measures]{.mark}, [same-sex marriage and gender
studies]{.mark}; they seek to re-instantiate traditional family and
associated gender roles; and [they pursue a strong-man style of
political leadership]{.mark}]{.underline} (Dietze, 2018, p. 34;
Inglehart & Norris, 2016, p. 7; Korolczuk & Graff, 2018; Mayer,
Ajanovic, & Sauer, 2018; Mayer, Sori, & Sauer, 2016; Norocel, 2013, p.
5). At the same time, somewhat paradoxically, the seeming 'gender
traditionalism' of populism (Sauer, Kuhar, Ajanovic, & Saarinen, 2016)
is undercut by the existence of female leaders of populist parties and
populists' appeals to European values of gender-equality and
emancipation (Akkerman, 2015; Dietze, 2018; Mayer, Ajanovic, & Sauer,
2014). This special issue contributes to the debate on gender and
populism by focusing on the relationship between the concepts of
political masculinities and populism. It developed from a conference on
Political Masculinities and Populism, hosted by the Political
Masculinities Network in December 2017, and based at the University of
Koblenz-Landau. The research network was established in 2012. It aimed
to bring scholars together, from different disciplines, who hold a
common interest in the political dimensions of masculinities. The
Political Masculinities Network merged with the Uppsala network on Men
in Politics in 2018. This research network is committed to critical
research on political masculinities and seeks to encourage a broad
church of cross-, inter- and multi-disciplinary debate with the aim of
comparing, contrasting, and where possible integrating different modes
of understanding and related findings from across academic disciplines.
The special issue contributes toward this project. We provide a brief
overview to this topic in this introductory paper. The concept of
populism Populism is a contested concept (Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser,
2017, p. 2). It is frequently used in media and political debate but
difficult to define as an analytical concept. The term refers to
different and conflicting political groups and projects. Whilst in
Europe it is most often associated with the (radical) political right,
the United States have a tradition of 'liberal populism', an expression,
which in Europe would be 'a blatant contradiction' (Müller, 2016, p. 9).
Populism has also been linked with left-wing politics, especially in
South American and southern European countries (Mudde & Rovira
Kaltwasser, 2015), whereas some populist movements are best described as
hybrid in combining elements of left and right (Brubaker, 2017, p.
358f.). Moreover, their social basis may be agrarian or urban; their
economic policies protectionist and state-centred or neoliberal and
market-centred; they may be secular or religious; and they may celebrate
cultural liberalism or attack it. Populist politicians may be
challengers or incumbents seeking to mobilize or demobilize.
Consequently, scholars from different backgrounds use the term to
describe different phenomena, which in turn have inspired different
analytical approaches. For instance, the study of populism in Latin
America focuses predominantly on economic and organizational aspects of
populism, while European scholars use to stress the political and
ideological aspects (Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser, 2015, p. 17f.) In
seeking to define the concept of populism, the only common basis for
doing so is that all populist movements, parties, figures, and regimes
claim to speak in the name of 'the people' against various 'elites'
(Brubaker, 2017, p. 359; Müller, 2016, p. 20). However, speaking in the
name of the people is assumed in modern democracies, and not confined to
populists. Further disagreements in definition ensue where some scholars
see populism as an ideology of democracy (Canovan, 2002), while others
view it as intrinsically anti-democratic, as 'a perverse inversion of
the ideals and procedures of \[electoral-representative\] democracy'
(Rosanvallon, 2008, p. 265). Yet others see its effect as enabling
democratization processes or contributing to the dismantling of
democracy, depending on the type of populism and on the political system
in which it occurs (Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser, 2017, p. 86). This
reveals the ambiguity of the concept of democracy and its defining
notion of 'the people' shifting between meanings of them as ordinary
(plebs), as sovereign (demos), and as culturally or ethnically distinct
(nation or ethnos). Therefore, 'the people', though crucial for
democracy, is essentially an empty signifier (Laclau, 2007), which comes
to represent something different across cultural, historical, political
and regional contexts. Although populism as an analytical concept is
contested, we agree with Rogers Brubaker (2017, p. 358) that it is
indispensable in understanding the current 'populist moment'. Moreover,
many scholars on populism agree that a key feature of populists is their
claim to be the 'true democrats' (Albertazzi & McDonnell, 2008, p. 4) by
not only claiming to speak in the name of 'the people', but the whole
people, following 'the idea that it's possible for the people to be one
and -- all of them -- to have one true representative' (Müller, 2016, p.
20). Populists combine this with a further claim that the current
political establishment fails to represent 'the people', or more
specifically, the general will of 'the people' (Otjes & Louwerse, 2015,
p. 61). Central to the populist claim is the notion that 'the people'
does not equate with the citizenry of a country, but refers to an
imagined 'heartland' of a virtuous, pure and uncorrupted population
(Taggart, 2000, p. 95). These notions are in line with the definition of
populism as a 'thin-centred ideology' (Mudde, 2004, p. 544), which
considers society to be separated into two homogeneous and antagonistic
groups, the 'pure people' and the 'corrupt elite' (Mudde, 2014; Mudde &
Rovira Kaltwasser, 2015, p. 18). In understanding populism ('us vs.
them') as 'thin-centred', it cannot stand alone, but is always in need
of a host ideology, which can be either right- or left-wing. This
minimal definition of populism is consistent with the analytical
approaches that are applied in the papers included in this special
issue. They study populism, for example, as a political style (see
Löffler) or as discourse generating heterogeneous and inconsistent
messages (see Wiedlack). They analyse the persona of a populist leader
(see Starck) or emphasis on how Weber's notion of charisma contains
populist claims to being against elites (see Geva). And finally, they
problematize the relationship between right-wing populism and minority
groups (see Lobban et al.). Populism and gender There is an extensive
literature discussing gender and populism. The following overview is not
intended to be exhaustive, but to illustrate the research perspectives
of this still growing field of research. Recent research on populism and
gender focuses on a wide range of individual, political and social
processes including, for example, the representation of women in
populist parties (e.g. Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser, 2015), their
performance (e.g. Norocel, 2018) and leadership (e.g. Meret, Siim, &
Pingaud, 2017); on the gender and the psychological characteristics of
populist supporters (e.g. Coffé, 2018) as well as gendered voting
behaviour (e.g. Spierings & Zaslove, 2015, 2017); on [[the
(anti-feminist) gender ideologies]{.mark} of right-wing populist
actors]{.underline} (e.g. Korolczuk & Graff, 2018; Kováts, 2018[) [and
their conservative gender (family) policies]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g.
Akkerman, 2015). With regard to the prominence afforded women in left-
and right-wing populist parties, Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser (2015)
challenge the Männerparteien thesis ('men's parties') formulated by
Amesberger and Halbmayr (2002). They argue that while right-wing
populist parties in Northern Europe perform on average worse than other
political parties, even if they have a female leader, left-wing populist
parties in South America seem to be progressive. However, the difference
relates to the cultural context, a highly emancipated society in
Northern Europe and strongly patriarchal societies in South America
(Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser, 2015, p. 17). Yet the degree to which a
party may be considered progressive may not necessarily be determined by
women's political prominence (Caravantes, 2019; Norocel, 2018). [T[he
cult of personality around populist leaders contributes to the
masculinization of politics.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The charismatic
leader is frequently seen as a feature of populism]{.mark}]{.underline}
(e.g. Taggart, 2000); [though gender neutral, [the descriptions of
charisma often reveal framings that feature predominantly masculine
attributes]{.mark}]{.underline} (Meret, 2015, p. 83). [[This leader is
usually portrayed as a masculine and potentially violent 'strongman',
ruling on the basis of 'a cult of a leader']{.underline}]{.mark} (Mudde
& Rovira Kaltwasser, 2017, p. 63). [Thus, there is an emphasis on action
and the courage to take difficult decisions, which relies on anti-
intellectualism and urgency and exemplified by the leader's virility,
the use of simple and vulgar language, and, of course, the leader's
charisma]{.underline} (Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser, 2017, pp. 64--68). As
noted above, [research has pointed to a gender paradox, namely the
existence of populist 'men's parties with women leaders']{.underline}
(Meret et al., 2017). Female populist leaders such as Eva Peron
(Argentina), Pia Kjærsgaard (Denmark), Marine LePen (France), Sarah
Palin (United States) or Alice Weidel (Germany) question the
taken-for-granted masculine qualities of populist leaders and populism
as well as, indeed, masculinities themselves. Gender research on
(Northern and Central) Europe often focuses on the populist radical
right parties (Akkerman, 2015; de Lange & Mügge, 2015; Mayer et al.,
2018; Spierings, Zaslove, Mügge, & de Lange, 2015) that emerged as a
political force since the 1980s (Mudde, 2004). Populist radical right
parties are characterized by their opposition to immigration as their
most salient and most successfully exploited issue. Consequently, they
do not only construct an ideological difference between 'the people' and
'the elite', but also between 'the people' as insiders and 'others'
(outsiders) who pose a threat to 'the people'. Since 2001, Islam has
been singled out as the main threat. Examining the vote for populist
radical right parties, a gender gap has been observed where more men
than women are supportive of them (Harteveld, Van Der Brug, Dahlberg, &
Kokkonen, 2015). However, the most important reason reported in
individuals supporting populist radical right parties remains the same
for men and women -- namely their opposition to immigration (Spierings
et al., 2015). The gender gap in voting for right-wing populists is
often overemphasized (Spierings & Zaslove, 2015) and reproduces the
notion of tolerant women vs. intolerant men. Yet we witnessed a large
proportion of women voting for the 45th President of the United States.
Moreover, there have been other minority group movements who espouse
support for right-wing populists such as 'Gays for Trump' and
'Alternative Homosexuals' who are part of the German right populist AfD
(Alternative für Deutschland). Populist radical right parties often hold
contradictory gender ideological views (Akkerman & Hagelund, 2007;
Dietze, 2018). [[They typically emphasize the traditional family and
gender roles as core institutions of society]{.underline}]{.mark} and
oppose same-sex marriage as well as abortion. But in debates concerning
immigration, in contrast, populist radical right parties have adopted
more liberal views of gender relations by emphasizing gender equality,
women's rights and freedom of choice (Akkerman, 2015, p. 40; Akkerman &
Hagelund, 2007). This apparent contradiction, between the 'liberal'
defence of gender equality in debates on immigration on the one hand,
and the 'conservative' defence of the traditional family and gender
roles on the other, has been explained by discursive shifts in populist
rhetoric when constructing 'others' -- 'those up there' (the elite) or
'not us' (Muslim immigrants) (Mayer et al., 2014). Many right-wing
populists support movements against gender equality, which have been
understood as a conservative backlash against levels of equality
achieved between women and men and/or LGBTQ rights (Kováts, 2018, p.
529). Most right-wing populist parties do not only support traditional
gender norms, but hold essentialist notions of gender as determined by
sex. They conceive of feminism as a threat to the 'natural' division of
the sexes, and hence, oppose policies that promote gender equality. This
is seen, for example, in their frequent demand to have gender studies
removed from university curricula (Küpper, 2018; Mayer et al., 2018).
However, 'gender' also stands in as a placeholder or empty signifier. As
discussed at the European Conference of Gender and Politics in 2019, in
Poland and other post-communist European countries, gender equality is
sometimes framed as 'communist' and therefore 'anti-democratic'. This
perspective fuels the populist claim that gender equality measures are
an elitist ideology working against 'the people'. In right-wing populist
discourse 'the people' is constructed in terms of biological
essentialism (Mayer et al., 2016), based on the idea of the traditional
conjugal family as the natural cornerstone to society, as well as the
pre-eminence of men and masculinities in politics (Kreisky, 2014).
Political masculinities In contrast to the construction of men and
masculinity in populist political discourse, we suggest elaborating a
concept of 'political masculinities' that can inform critical gender
research. In order to facilitate cross-, inter- and multi-disciplinary
dialogue, Kathleen Starck and Birgit Sauer propose a broad definition of
political masculinity, which encompasses any kind of masculinity that is
constructed around, ascribed to and/or claimed by 'political players'.
These shall be individuals or groups of persons who are part of or
associated with the 'political domain', i.e. professional politicians,
party members, members of the military as well as citizens and members
of political movements claiming or gaining political rights. (Starck &
Sauer, 2014, p. 6). This broad definition of political masculinity has
served as a foundation for a growing body of work, fostering dialogue
between a wide range of disciplines, on topics as diverse as political
masculinities' involvement with, and associated tensions in, prevention
of violence against women initiatives in the United Kingdom (Burrell,
2020); political masculinities in parliamentary debates during Austria's
period of postwar nation-building (Löffler, 2019); the Indian state's
intervention, along with the role played by both state and non-state
political masculinities, in practices of sex selection (Rahm, 2019); and
the political masculinities of pro-feminist men involved in an Israeli
high school gender equality intervention programme (Schwartz, 2020).
These, and other studies, have contributed toward developing the concept
of political masculinity/ies. A few key observations are useful in this
respect. Starck and Luyt (2019) recognize that the original definition
particularly speaks to masculinities that are more overtly, or easily
recognized, as political (e.g. professional politicians). Yet they
stress the importance of including individuals, groups, practices or
representations of those whose impact on or within the political sphere
is less easily identified (e.g. citizens, media tycoons, global
businessmen/women). This allows us to scrutinize the dynamics of
interactions between a wide range of 'political players' and
masculinities, an indispensable focus for analysing change in gender
relations[. [Political masculinities are crucial in the reproduction of
power relations. However, the concepts of gender and masculinities
include dimensions of power. Masculinity is therefore always
political]{.underline}.]{.mark} While gender and masculinities are
inextricably political concepts in the production and reproduction of
power, it is argued that the concept of political masculinities holds
particular use in 'instances in which power is explicitly either being
(re)produced or challenged' (Starck & Luyt, 2019, p. 435). We see the
reproduction of power through political masculinities clearly in the
contributions toward this special issue. For example, Dorit Geva
describes how Marine Le Pen draws on charisma, as a characteristic of
political masculinity that is not in conflict with notions of political
femininity in France, in order to further her political influence;
Marion Löffler demonstrates that masculinities exist as a symbolic
resource that is flexibly drawn upon by political actors in Austria to
further their political advantage; whilst Kathleen Starck similarly
identifies Nigel Farage's (United Kingdom) active construction of his
persona to incorporate different representations of masculinity in order
to appeal to a wide national audience.

**Embracing a feminist method that rejects liberal assumptions key to
solve fascism and war**

**Quinn 19-** (Erin, Graduate student at University of London, * Why Our
Feminism Must be Anti-Facist,* Publisher: Centre for Gender Studies.)

SOAS' Centre for Gender Studies concluded its seminar series for the
term on Thursday, December 13th, with a discussion of the relationship
between feminism and anti-fascism with activists from Sisters Uncut, a
[feminist direct action group fighting in solidarity with survivors of
domestic, sexual, and state violence, and Brazilian Women Against
Fascism UK.]{.underline}

The panel discussed the rise of fascism in the UK and around the globe,
connected solidarity against oppression and state violence, and
highlighted the challenges facing feminist activists. [The rise of
figures like new president-elect of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, Donald
Trump, and Boris Johnson fuel normalize fascist **discourse, expanding
violence.** Within this context, the panel was a poignant and timely
reminder that **feminism must be grounded in anti-fascism, and
anti-fascism must be grounded in feminism.**]{.underline}

[As an activist from Sisters Uncut emphasized, austerity cuts that often
accompany far-right governments are targeted at marginalized
communities, and affect women of color disproportionately.]{.underline}
Attacks on marginalized communities are a central tenet of fascism that
grounds itself in a divisive and violent discourse of "us" versus
"them". The consequences of this discourse are played out
transnationally. As one Brazilian panelist emphasized, this is playing
out now In Brazil, where since the election in October attacks against
LGBTQ persons have greatly intensified.

[One of the commonalities highlighted between Brazil and the UK was the
part that the liberal rights framework and liberal feminists play in the
reproduction of far-right and state violence, and their role in the
**normalization of fascist discourse and "dialogue" between "equal
sides**".]{.underline} As one of the Brazilian activists highlighted,
transnationally, the left has been disorganized; it has not done enough
and has allowed fascism to flourish. In Brazil, the Black Indigenous
movement has always had to fight for survival within liberal feminism.
[In a country where a Black youth is killed every 23 minutes, the
priority is one of survival, not of rights. Liberal feminists see the
value of structures and institutions, like for example the criminal
justice system, which itself is founded on ideals of white supremacy and
capitalism]{.underline}. However, as one of the activists from Sisters
Uncut stressed, the entire state and economic system is built on
oppression, especially the oppression of communities of color; these
systems were designed to function on and profit off of inequality.
[Therefore, although liberal rights "gains" may provide greater access
to resources and "equality" for some communities, alternative radical
systematic change will be required to produce any type of real
equality.]{.underline}

The panelists emphasized that persistence is necessary. [Thinking beyond
structures, imagining future alternatives by reflecting on past work,
and being receptive to tensions **within movements is necessary to
continue to fight and resist state and fascist**
narratives.]{.underline} [Ultimately, the panel underscored the role
feminists have played in the resistance against power structures in the
past and in the present, and challenged those in the audience to show up
not just for panel discussions, but for the rallies, the protests, and
the organizing meetings.]{.underline}

disparate treatment, address feminist concerns?]{.underline}

Formally, [yes -- but a cursory examination of the ways in which issues
are addressed even within socialist circles brings this into
question]{.underline}. Even in these more favorable environs, [the need
for an explicitly feminist view remains]{.underline}. After all,
[patriarchy as a sex/gender system of organizing society existed long
before the capitalist mode of production revolutionized society and
colored its directives]{.underline}. **How would feminism change our
common vision?** Most obviously, [feminist socialism recognizes that
work and economics are different for men and women and takes that into
account. Too often, socialists overlook the fact that women's earnings
trail men's for many reasons. These include 1) their greater
representation in low-wage jobs; 2) greater numbers in government jobs,
which have been getting cut due to the recession and attacks on public
sector workers; and 3) lifetime lower earnings, due to a pay
differential that has hardly moved in the past 10 years.]{.underline}
Outside the formal economy, [women also do the vast majority of un-waged
work, whether in the home or the informal economy. A feminist socialist
vision recognizes the immense unpaid labor that sustains the capitalist
economy and the need to address it when developing an alternative, so
that the burden of holding up family and community doesn't fall
disproportionately on women yet again.]{.underline} **Why is [this
critical fact so often overlooked by socialists who lack a feminist
analysis]{.underline}? **

 

First**,**because [identifying specific disadvantaged groups based on
color, country of origin, ethnicity, etc. involves defining those
groupings by their characteristics and often by location and/or
proximity. Women, by contrast, are a worldwide group that encompasses
any or all characteristics, and are always present]{.underline} -- that
is, they are visible and not visible. [This results from their daily
interaction with men as wives, mothers, employees, etc., in both public
and private life, rather than as a discrete racial or ethnic group that
specific people may not encounter on a regular basis. Women are thus not
recognized as a class, either economically or politically.]{.underline}

Second**,**many socialists think in terms of economics but not culture,
whereas [feminists understand that in a patriarchal society, assumptions
regarding women's inferiority to men become so deeply embedded that they
are an unconscious part of our dominant worldview, introduced in
childhood and enforced throughout life. The economic and cultural
limitations under which women live their lives are often simply not
noticed by men and are frequently policed by both men and
women]{.underline} (often subconsciously, sometimes not).

One instance that may illustrate this is [the incredibly misogynous
jokes directed at Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 2008 presidential
election. Racist comments were rightly denounced, but sexist ones didn't
evoke the same reaction.]{.underline} While Clinton and New York mayoral
candidate Christine Quinn are [neoliberal capitalist women, their
treatment demonstrates that women have still not achieved
the]{.underline} (admittedly insufficient) [first stage of making people
uncomfortable with openly misogynous remarks, in the same way that
people often make sure to hide or disguise racial
prejudice.]{.underline} **What does this mean for the struggle for
democratic socialism?** Much as [we simply cannot understand class
without understanding race, so no understanding is complete without an
analysis of how patriarchy intersects with capitalism.]{.underline}
Under [the continuing brutal economic assaults of exploitative
capitalism, many economically disadvantaged men need to have a "lesser"
that can enhance their feelings of worth in an economy and society that
provides limited pathways for their success. Long-established cultural
norms and the needs of the capitalist class combine to reinforce this
devalued position and set expectations for woman's role as helpmate and
supporter rather than as an equal economic actor. Socialists undercut
our own movement by not speaking to the needs of women, who are, after
all, more than half the world.]{.underline}

But [an adequate socialist feminist analysis would move beyond simply
identifying the varying levels of gender disadvantage to a more rigorous
identification of how society is constructed]{.underline}. [As
feminists, we would pay attention to the underlying and unexamined
expectations that shape gender-related questions such as who does
caregiving, how we organize family and private life, what kind of work
confers respect on the worker, etc. We would subject economic,
historical and social patterns to socialist analysis and measure them
against socialist ideals]{.underline}. Finally, [we would analyze how
gender intersects with other categories of identity such as race,
ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and citizenship.]{.underline}

The struggle to [integrate women's experience thoroughly into socialist
theory and practice and to de-emphasize male experience as *the*
paradigm will not be achieved immediately.]{.underline}  [We cannot
erase thousands of years of deeply absorbed assumptions and widely
distributed cultural attitudes in a few generations. We have little
awareness of how ingrained and unconscious these barriers are except for
when that still, small voice occasionally says in a woman's ear "that's
not fair!"]{.underline}  But [socialists cannot allow half of the
population to be an afterthought.]{.underline} While DSAers discuss
reproductive justice in the context of the recent surge in punitive
activity, that and [other feminist issues tend to trail low wages,
immigration, the continuing recession, etc., as a focus of discussion,
and the feminist take on each of these issues is not fully explored.
This must change.]{.underline}

A century [after the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire, women have become nearly
half of the unionized labor force. They work in the growing service and
public employment sectors as nurses, home attendants, teachers, and
clerks. Previously labeled women's issues---maternity leave, equal pay,
sexual harassment, and work-family balance---have become union
issues]{.underline}. [Women hold leadership positions in the AFL-CIO and
Change to Win. With the disappearance of manufacturing and the growth of
service labor, women of color---both immigrant- and U.S.- born---have
become the driving force in the labor movement for safe jobs, living
wages, and dignity at work, leading women-dominated unions and worker
associations. It is not an overstatement to say that the future of the
labor movement appears up to the women.]{.underline} 1.It hasn't always
been this way. [For at least a century, labor feminists have fought for
the interests of wage-earning women and workingclass housewives, both
within the feminist and the labor movements.]{.underline} Still, [the
priorities of the women's movement for sex-based rights and those of the
labor movement for class solidarity often diverged during the twentieth
century. Working-class feminists struggled against middle-class
feminists who focused primarily on achieving equality with male
professionals and executives. They also battled men who sought to
exclude women from unionized jobs and who denied organized women workers
a full share of power in the labor movement.]{.underline}

Highlighting [key moments when feminists and unionists came together
over the last century, this essay offers a usable past drawn from the
fraught---but often productive---relationship between feminism and
labor.]{.underline} An examination of the contact between organized
women's groups and organized labor, [women's organizations within the
labor movement, and feminist labor organizing shows that when feminists
and unions worked together, both benefited.]{.underline} [Labor gained
when it understood women's issues as crucial for the advancement of the
working class.]{.underline} [The women's movement was at its strongest
when its membership and agenda crossed class lines. Recognition of this
history may help to revitalize feminism as much as organized
labor.]{.underline}

Labor Feminism Before the 1960s: [The Women's Trade Union
League]{.underline}

[The years surrounding 1911's Triangle Shirtwaist Fire saw significant
and broad-based collaboration between labor activists and middle- to
upper-class feminists in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.
[That period began with the creation of the Women's Trade Union League
(WTUL) in 1903.]{.underline} The League, as it was known by its members,
[drew together educated women reformers (mostly white, Protestant, and
native-born) and young women workers (many of them immigrant Jews,
Italians, and Irish) to improve factory wages, working conditions, and
hours.]{.underline} [The WTUL embodied both an unusual degree of
collaboration between feminists and the labor movement, and the many
tensions that arose from longstanding attempts to build lasting and
productive relationships.]{.underline} 2.[This]{.underline} cross-class
[women's network deepened with the uprisings of young women garment
workers that began in New York in 1909 and then spread over the next few
years into other Eastern and Midwestern cities.]{.underline}
Middle-class and affluent supporters of woman suffrage---including
[League activists, college students, and even wealthy socialites---saw
these strikes as an opportunity to win working women to the
cause.]{.underline} Forming what the press dubbed "mink brigades,"
[affluent supporters marched alongside young immigrant women on picket
lines in a largely successful attempt to reduce high rates of police
brutality.]{.underline} After they bailed arrested strikers out of jail,
they spoke (alongside the released strikers) for woman suffrage on the
steps of jails and courthouses. [Affluent feminists brought working
women into existing suffrage organizations, as well as offering
financial support for the establishment of working-class suffrage
groups. Working women understood, as Polish Jewish cap maker Rose
Schneiderman explained in 1907, that they "must . . . secure political
power to shape their own labor conditions."]{.underline} 3.[Women
factory and manufacturing workers knew they needed the political and
financial support of these more affluent "allies."]{.underline}
Nonetheless, imbalances in social power and financial resources
generated much conflict in the first two decades of the century, when
working-class members felt bullied, condescended to, or generally
misunderstood. [While many working-class women embraced socialism and
anarchism, their better-off allies mostly shied away from revolutionary
politics, preferring to reform the existing system. The refusal of
working women to eschew more radical approaches moved affluent women to
withdraw financial support from independent working women's groups,
prompting angry responses.]{.underline} "It is up to the working people
to save themselves," Schneiderman tongue-lashed a theater full of
affluent New Yorkers after the Triangle Fire.4. In the aftermath of the
fire, [women labor activists and reformers redoubled efforts to win the
vote, and industrial feminists (the self-name of labor feminists of that
day) like Schneiderman began to focus as much on passing laws to
regulate wages and labor conditions as they did on union
organizing.]{.underline} [Frances Perkins]{.underline} (the future U.S.
Secretary of Labor under Franklin Roosevelt) of the National Consumers
League [and Pauline Newman]{.underline} (a former Triangle employee and
WTUL activist) [were appointed as investigators for the New York State
Factory Investigating Commission (FIC), positions they used to educate
powerful politicians about the conditions under which working women
labored.]{.underline} Over the next three years, the New York FIC, and
sister organizations in the other industrial states, pushed through a
dramatically expanded regulatory structure for factory labor---including
[laws that empowered state commissioners of labor, banned the labor of
children under the age of fourteen, and required inspection of elevators
and fireproof devices.]{.underline} 5.During World War I, [this
collaboration between middle-class feminists, women labor activists, and
Democratic Party politicians resulted in the founding of a Women in
Industry Service to monitor conditions of women working on defense
contracts.]{.underline} After the war, [President Wilson established a
permanent Women's Bureau in the U.S. Department of Labor to investigate
women's working conditions.]{.underline} Its creation marked the
ascension of "industrial" and "social" feminists to federal government
positions of authority, a significant move toward remaking the state as
a force sympathetic to at least some of the goals of the labor movement.
6.[By the 1920s]{.underline}, when the WTUL came to be run by labor
union women---such as Schneiderman and Newman---[it was genuinely a
cross-class, multi-ethnic organization.]{.underline} Still, once U.S.
women won the right to vote, relations between the self-described
feminists of the National Women's Party (NWP) and women in the labor
movement frayed. [In the early 1920s, NWP leaders began lobbying for an
Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the Constitution, which declared it
unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of sex]{.underline}. [The
labor movement rejected the ERA out of fear that it would negate
hard-won legislation protecting women workers. Ignoring industrial
feminists' pleas to adopt a more piecemeal approach to gender equality,
the NWP introduced the ERA into every session of Congress from 1921 into
the early 1970s, driving a deep and lasting wedge between the labor
movement and feminist activists.]{.underline}

Labor [opponents of the ERA gained the upper hand with the election of
Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. He was, along with his wife Eleanor, a
key ally of the New York WTUL]{.underline}. With [the appointment of
League leaders like Perkins and Schneiderman to key government
positions, FDR signaled support for the goals of the labor-feminist
alliance]{.underline}. [Perkins oversaw the extension of wage-and-hour
and safety protections for all workers, regardless of
gender,]{.underline} through the National Labor Relations Act of 1935
and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938. These laws marked a
turning point for union men who had long been ambivalent toward the idea
of legislating labor conditions. [No longer were strategies for
improving the lives of workers so starkly divided by sex.]{.underline}

Still, [race continued to divide the working class.]{.underline} The
[new legislation intentionally denied coverage to agricultural and
domestic workers---the fields in which most women of color were
employed. Many within the labor-feminist coalition pushed to expand
federal laws]{.underline}, including the Social Security Act of 1935,
[to extend coverage to these occupations. They also expanded the reach
of the labor movement, by supporting organizing drives among service
workers, many]{.underline} of whom [were women of color.]{.underline} In
[reaching out to black and immigrant organizers like Maida Springer
Kemp, Dolly Robinson, and Charlotte Adelman,]{.underline} the mid-1930s
[WTUL brought laundry workers, waitresses, and hotel maids---who had
been largely ignored by white male unionists---into the labor movement.
This same period saw the mass organizing of Caribbean immigrants and
Puerto Ricans in the East, and Mexican-Americans in the
West.]{.underline} These populations [had long been ignored by the
male-led unions.]{.underline}

With [the coming of World War II]{.underline}, largescale [employment of
women in defense plants moved feminist labor issues into the center of
public discussion. Early in the war years, manufacturers attempted to
label any new jobs in defense production as "female" work, enabling them
to pay women workers less than the prevailing union wage.]{.underline}
[Labor leaders' longstanding attempts to keep the best-paid jobs for
white male union members had to be rethought,]{.underline} given the
labor shortages resulting from the wartime draft.
[Reluctantly]{.underline} at first, more enthusiastically
[later]{.underline}, [some unions]{.underline}---most notably the United
Electrical Workers (UE)--- [began to resist sex-based pay
differentials.]{.underline} [Even leaders with little concern for
women's salaries worried that,]{.underline} if they allowed
manufacturers to pay women less during the war, [when men came home
afterwards, it would be difficult to bring wages back up.
Other]{.underline} [unions]{.underline} [retained sex]{.underline}-based
[pay differentials in their contracts,]{.underline} but [in 1942 the
National War Labor Board---responding to years of lobbying by
labor-feminist groups like the WTUL---established]{.underline} a [policy
of equal pay for men and women performing the same jobs. The 1963 Equal
Pay Act,]{.underline} the first time the federal government put its
power behind equal pay for equal work, [was the fruit of continuing
labor-feminist agitation on this issue.]{.underline}

With [wage-earning mothers constituting 36 percent of]{.underline} the
[labor]{.underline} force [by the war's end, work and family
balance]{.underline} inevitably [became an urgent labor
issue]{.underline}. Joint [efforts between feminists and male unionists
mitigated the "double day" with publicly supported child care, flexible
hours, and more convenient shopping options.]{.underline} [Industrial
unions recognized womanpower through special women's committees; the
U]{.underline}nited [A]{.underline}utomobile [W]{.underline}orkers (UAW)
[committee carried forward the labor-feminist agenda into the early
postwar years, in collaboration with the U.S. Women's Bureau. 7.Labor
Feminism Since 1960]{.underline}

[The 1960s and 1970s saw an explosion of interactions between feminists
and trade unionists,]{.underline} and an energetic feminism within the
labor movement. [As women's liberation activists discovered the working
class---with help from World War II-era trade unionists and
leftists---feminist caucuses sprung up within existing
unions.]{.underline} [At its first convention in 1974, thirty-five
thousand women gathered together not "to swap recipes," as Myra Wolfgang
of HERE taunted George Meany and the rest of labor's male
leadership,]{.underline} but to organize the Coalition of Labor Union
Women (CLUW). Along with explicitly feminist groups like the Union
Women's Alliance to Gain Equality (Union WAGE) and 9to5, [CLUW declared
women's issues to be union issues.]{.underline} 8.In honoring [WTUL
stalwart Pauline Newman at its founding meeting, CLUW recognized
generational continuities among labor feminists.]{.underline} [Its
stated priorities explicitly echoed those of the WTUL: strengthening the
role of women in unions; organizing unorganized women; achieving pay
equity; and increasing the involvement of women in the political and
legislative process.]{.underline} But [CLUW added goals that reflected
changing times---promoting affirmative action for women in the
workplace, addressing the concerns of aging women workers, and tackling
substance abuse.]{.underline} In 1980, CLUW president Joyce Miller
became the first woman on the AFL-CIO's executive board---a modest and
long-overdue recognition of the significance of women in the labor
movement.

Trade [union feminists helped launch a revitalized women's movement that
sparked new demands for women's rights at home, on the job, and within
unions.]{.underline} [Clericals, flight attendants, and domestic workers
contested the dominant assumption within the AFL-CIO that women workers
were unorganizable.]{.underline} **[Collective action]{.underline}**
[hit pink-collar occupations.]{.underline} [This]{.underline} trend [was
exemplified by the formation of Stewardesses for Women's Rights, the
Willmar Bank Employees' Association strike in 1977, and the highly
creative and flexible campaign to organize Harvard's clerical and
technical workers. Independent women's associations]{.underline}, like
Chicago's Women Employed, [were far more likely to initiate such efforts
than were traditional labor unions.]{.underline} At a time [when most
unions still concentrated on manufacturing, feminists argued for both
the economic value of women's unpaid labor in the home and the worth of
women's work in service industries.]{.underline} They anticipated the
strategies needed to organize the future economy. 9.At the same time,
[trade union women shaped the new feminism in two ways.]{.underline}
First, [they complicated the meaning of equality by bringing to the
feminist agenda issues like child care and flextime that women needed to
balance wage-earning with family life.]{.underline} [By the 1970s, labor
feminists went beyond an anti-discrimination program to insist that
women's rights at work included pregnancy leave and other labor
standards, and that these issues mattered to the labor movement even if
they did not apply to men.]{.underline} The [World War II efforts of the
International Union of Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers (IUE) laid
the basis for feminist organizing in the 1970s that culminated in the
Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978.]{.underline} [In 1982, twenty
thousand Chinese-immigrant garment workers forced union-sponsored day
care onto the agenda of the labor movement by leaving their babies on
the desk of previously unresponsive garment union president Jay
Mazur.]{.underline} 10.Second, [they had an institutional impact. Not
only would longtime union activists, like Stella Nowicki]{.underline}
from Chicago's stockyards, [become involved with women's liberation---
they also helped birth its most national manifestation.]{.underline} In
1966, Caroline Davis and Dorothy Haener from the UAW's Women's
Department became key founders of the National Organization for Women
(NOW), providing office space and clerical services to that fledging
organization. NOW's co-founder and most famous leader, Betty Friedan,
had learned to organize in the UE. 11[.UAW women were in the forefront
of shifting labor's stand toward the ERA. Like other women in
male-dominated or mixedsex industries]{.underline}---and unlike allies
in the U.S. Women's Bureau---[they viewed women's labor laws not as
protective devices but as tools of both management and hostile male
workers who sought to limit women's opportunities and pay. They
applauded the striking down of sex-based labor restrictions under Title
VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, achieved through the cooperation of
labor and feminist legislators.]{.underline} 12.In the years that
followed, [many local groups bridged the gaps between trade unionism and
the women's movement.]{.underline} 13.In California's Bay Area, two
activists rooted in the old left---Jean Maddox of the militant Local 29
of the Office and Professional Employees International Union and Ann
Draper of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union--- established Union
WAGE in 1971. [They aimed to counter NOW's neglect of working women and
support organizing through rank-and-file movements and independent
associations. The larger women's movement, in turn, influenced WAGE,
which fought for reproductive rights, struggled against sexual
harassment and racism, and condemned discrimination on the basis of
sexual orientation, age, and disability.14]{.underline}

Citywide clerical associations, along with workplace-based women's
caucuses, more typically represented the collective action inspired by
feminist and other radical insurgencies against the AFL-CIO.15 [In the
early 1970s, 9to5 expanded from a consciousness-raising group among
Harvard clerical workers to become (first) an organization of Boston
clerical workers, then part of the National Association of Working
Women.]{.underline} In 1975, [it created a companion union---Local
9to5---that was affiliated with the SEIU. Under the banner "Raises not
Roses," clerical women petitioned, picketed, sued, and engaged in
creative street actions.]{.underline} In the 1990s, founder Karen
Nussbaum brought a feminist perspective to her tenure as director of the
U.S. Women's Bureau and, in 1996, as the head of the AFL-CIO's new
Working Women's Department.16

[Feminists also established caucuses within established unions. Among
the most effective, the District 31 (based in Northwest Indiana's
Calumet Region) Women's Caucus of the United Steelworkers
mobilized]{.underline} "burly" [men to march for the ERA in Illinois, a
major industrial state resisting ratification.]{.underline} [It joined
with]{.underline} a [multiracial]{.underline} coalition of Chicago-area
[women's groups to fight against job discrimination and violence against
women and for abortion rights.]{.underline} It also defended women's
jobs during layoffs.17

In the early 1970s, black feminist leaders Shirley Chisholm and Eleanor
Holmes Norton sought to jointly mobilize the civil rights, labor, and
women's movements to improve the conditions of domestic service. While
the AFL-CIO still could not imagine organizing such workers, its members
joined a cross-class and multiracial mix of feminists in supporting the
1974 expansion of the Fair Labor Standards Act to cover domestic
workers. With the support of the National Committee on Household
Employment, a black feminist organization initially founded by labor
feminists, domestic workers themselves mobilized as the Household
Technicians of America (HTA) in 1972. Given the stigma associated with
domestic service, local groups across the nation sought not only
traditional bread-and-butter improvements but also respect for their
work and humanity through written contracts, public recognition
ceremonies, and training and education programs.18

Las Vegas became a surprising base for labor feminism when a multiracial
workforce of hotel maids turned the city's Hotel and Culinary Workers
Union Local 226 into the largest private union local in the United
States in the 1990s. Beginning in the 1940s, AfricanAmerican women
assumed leadership roles. In the 1950s, under pioneering business agent
Sara Hughes, black women who labored as "back of the house" workers in
the city's hotels and casinos became organized. But, twenty years later,
African-American workers contested the union's collaboration with hotel
management to segregate them into the lowest wage positions in the hotel
workforce. A series of protests and court challenges yielded a federal
consent decree forcing the union and Las Vegas hotels to train and place
women and workers of color into higher-paid jobs. In the late 1980s, the
union's multiracial membership ratified some of the best contracts in
the nation for service workers. This period of success for unionized
women of color culminated in 1990 when Hattie Canty---a black migrant
mother of ten---became president of the Culinary Union.19

Toward the Future

The relationship between the women's movement and organized labor has
shifted over the last twenty-five years. The AFL-CIO has incorporated
major concerns of wage-earning women into its formal agenda, calling
for: equal pay, work and family balance, and prevention of violence
against women in the workplace. Middle-class feminists played a role in
pushing unions to recognize these concerns, but too often they ignored
how class structures the outcome of gender inequality, as in questions
of remuneration, time flexibility, and the double day. While feminists
of all classes easily embraced equal pay, middleclass people are less
active in seeking redress for underpaid caregivers. Jamaican immigrant
Evelyn Coke---the Long Island home care worker whose exclusion from the
minimum wage law the SEIU litigated---garnered meager feminist support
for her plight. On the other hand, feminists gave crucial support to new
formations---like Domestic Workers United in New York City and other
ethnically-based associations---that seek dignity and recognition as
well as better working conditions. These efforts culminated in September
2010 when New York became the first state to adopt a Domestic Worker
Bill of Rights.20

Most significantly, [women have become the new face of labor, composing
the majority of union recruits. As manufacturing declined and the
service economy exploded, immigrant women in low-wage jobs brought a new
vitality and militancy to unionization]{.underline}. The numbers of jobs
in teaching, nursing, and clerical work that employed more women than
men continued to grow right up to the beginnings of the current
recession, increasing women's percentage of the unionized workforce. In
service industries, women now make up half of all unionists. Their
numbers have begun to close the overall membership gap.21

[While unions once saw women as unorganizable, today they count on them.
Examples range across the labor force, but concentrate in the health
care sector.]{.underline} Most of the seventy-four thousand Los Angeles
home aides who voted to join the SEIU in 1999 were women. The
150,000-strong National Nurses United, formed in 2009 from three nurses
groups, became the nation's largest union of medical professionals.22
Though the numbers of women in leadership positions are nowhere near
parity, Mary Kay Henry replaced Andy Stern as the head of the SEIU in
2010. Linda Chavez-Thompson served as executive vice-president of the
AFL-CIO for over a decade, and then was replaced by another AFSCME
(American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees) leader,
Arlene Holt Baker. And, in 2009, Liz Shuler of the IUE became the first
woman elected as the federation's secretary-treasurer.

[Women of color---many of them immigrants---have spearheaded fights
against today's sweatshops in the fields and in homes, and have
organized workers in food processing and garment
production.]{.underline} They have revived hotel worker militancy, as
evidenced by HERE's ongoing Hotel Workers Rising initiative and Boston
chambermaids' protest against the Hyatt chain.23 Joined by middle-class
feminist allies---some of whom were from the same ethnic group (as with
Asian Immigrant Women Advocates)---they are addressing workplace
conditions and occupational safety issues that represent today's
equivalent to the hazards of a century ago, including carpel tunnel
injuries and industrial fires. [In the 1990s, Mexicana farm workers of
Líderes Campesinas investigated the impact of pesticides on pregnancy
and highlighted sexual harassment as well as the continued low wages
paid for work in California's fields.]{.underline}24 [Worker
centers---like the Garment Worker Center in Los Angeles and many
others---are linking feminism, immigrant rights, and worker justice on a
daily basis in working-class communities.25]{.underline}

[A century ago, the Triangle Fire horrified New York City and the nation
as a whole, forcing the labor movement, feminists, and political
reformers to more systematically address the murderous conditions facing
American workers. Over the years, feminists and trade unionists came
together in numerous ways, engaging in vibrant coalitions that enabled
them to transcend their differences.]{.underline} [Today's labor
movement has become, in large measure, a women's movement.]{.underline}
Whether it will stay that way remains to be seen. Is the feminization of
the labor movement yet another indicator of its decline? Or is it a
harbinger of labor's renewal? One hundred years after Triangle that
question remains unresolved. [One thing is certain: the future strength
of the labor movement depends on its women, and the future of feminism
will continue to be shaped by labor.]{.underline}

advantage of. Sexism is part of the company toolkit, enabling firms to
pay women less--- particularly women of color--- and otherwise
discriminate against them.

[But even if we root out sexism,the inherent contradictions of
capitalism will persist. It is important and necessary that women step
into positions of power, but this won't change the fundamental divide
between workers and owners]{.underline}--- between women at the top and
women at the bottom. 

It won't change the fact that most women find themselves in precarious,
low-wage jobs that present a far greater barrier to advancement and a
comfortable life than sexism in the economic or political sphere. It
won't change the power of the profit motive and the compulsion of
companies to give workers as little as economic, social, and cultural
norms will allow.

 Of course, society is not reducible to the wage relation, and gender
divides are real and persistent. [Taking class seriously means anchoring
the oppression of women within the material conditions in which they
live and work while recognizing the role of sexism in shaping both
women's work life and their home life. ]{.underline}

The feminist movement--- both its "social-welfare" incarnation and its
radical contemporary--- has made significant gains. The [challenge now
is twofold:to defend these hard-won victories and make it possible for
all women to actually enjoy them, and to push forward with new, concrete
demands that address the complex relationship between sexism and
profit-making. ]{.underline}

There is no simple answer to how to accomplish these twin goals. In the
past, women have made the biggest gains by fighting for both women's
rights and workers' rights simultaneously--- linking the fight against
sexism to the fight against capital. 

As Eileen Boris and Anelise Orleck argue, during the 1970s and '80s,
"trade union feminists helped launch a revitalized women's movementthat
sparked new demands for women's rights at home, on the job, and within
unions." Airline stewardesses, garment workers, clericals, and domestic
workers challenged the male-dominated trade union movement(a woman
didn't sit on the AFL-CIO executive board until 1980) and in the process
forged a new, more expansive feminism. 

[Trade union women created a new field of possibility by demanding not
only higher wages and equal opportunity but also child care, flexible
work schedules, pregnancy leave, and other gains usually overlooked or
undervalued by their union brothers. ]{.underline}

[This is the direction that both socialists and feminists should be
orienting themselves--- toward struggles and demands that challenge both
the drives of capital and the ingrained norms of sexism that are so
deeply rooted under capitalism.]{.underline}

 Struggles and demands that achieve this are concrete and are currently
being fought for. For example,the struggle for single-payer
healthcare--- which would provide healthcare as a right to every person
from cradle to grave regardless of their ability to pay--- is a demand
that undermines both sexism and the power of capital to control and
repress worker agency. [There are many other concrete short-term demands
that blend the goals of feminism and socialism as well, including free
higher education, free child care, and a universal basic income combined
with a robust social safety net.]{.underline}

[ These reforms would lay the groundwork for more radical goals that
would go far in rooting out sexism, exploitation, and the
commodification of social life.]{.underline} For example, projects to
increase collective, democratic control over institutions central to our
home, school, and work lives--- schools, banks, workplaces, city
governments, and state and local agencies---would give all women and men
more power, autonomy, and the possibility for a better life. 

This anticapitalist strategy is one that contains the possibility for
the radical change that women need. 

**[Ultimately the goals of a radical feminism and socialism are the
same--- justice and equality for all people, not simply equal
opportunity for women or equal participation by women in an unjust
system.]{.underline}**
