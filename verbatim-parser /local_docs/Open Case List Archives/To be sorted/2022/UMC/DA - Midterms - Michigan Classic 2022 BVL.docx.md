# MIDTERMS POLITICS DA- BLV 2022

## NOTES

Thanks to labbies Edwin Avery, Angie Chao, Amber Deng, Moonyoung Hwang,
Albert Khawam, Jeff Vallyath, Liam Werner, Patrick Wong for their work
on this DA.

Rather than have a traditional neg file and Aff AT, we divided all we
found into 2 scenarios---Affs should def make link turn blocks to run
the opposite midterms scenario that negs run against them. My hunch is
that most teams will run scenarios that "GOP Win Bad" in which case you
should read the internal link turns that talk about how a GOP loss would
lead to political violence, backlash and civil war.

Because debate is fun though, the civil war impact can also link to "Dem
win good" scenario talking about how Dems in congress are key to
maintaining guardrails of election law etc.

You will need to sell the story of why plan will be perceived by the
public (use cross ex and the Affs own 1AC evidence to build up story
that plan is a BFD) and that plan will be perceived by
Democrat/Republican voting block. You could also try to be fancy and add
"winners win" cards to tell a story that plan would be perceived as a
win for a political party and that it would give them momentum heading
into the elections. Be creative. Find your own adventure.

WASHINGTON, May 3 (Reuters) - [Democrats have needed something to turn
around their flagging midterm election fortunes, and the U.S. Supreme
Court may have just given it to them.]{.underline}

[A leaked draft showing the court\'s conservative majority apparently
poised to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision has set off a
political firestorm over abortion rights just as the 2022 election
season heats up.]{.underline} read more

[U.S. abortion rights have been under direct threat for years, if not
decades. But if the high court follows through and does away with
constitutional protection for terminating a pregnancy, the issue will
crystallize for millions of voters like never before]{.underline},
Democratic advocates and strategists say.

\"You have a right that is wildly popular with the electorate, and you
have an electorate that has not really grappled with the fact that it
could be taken away,\" said Jessica Floyd, president of American Bridge,
a Democratic political action committee. \"The dynamic here is fairly
unprecedented.\"

[Democrats quickly seized on the issue as one that could reshape a
difficult political environment going into the November elections, when
control of both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives will be
at stake.]{.underline}

[Democratic candidates and party-aligned groups sent out fundraising
pleas pegged to the prospect of Roe being overturned. \"Every single one
of my GOP (Republican) opponents supports dangerous, restrictive
anti-abortion laws]{.underline},\" congressman Tim Ryan, who is running
for Senate in Ohio, wrote in an email to supporters on Tuesday.

The party in power typically loses seats in the first term of a new
president. With opinion polls showing Democratic President Joe Biden
unpopular with a majority of Americans, analysts have forecast
Republicans to take over the House and perhaps the Senate as well. read

But [polls have also shown the right to abortion to be broadly popular.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted on Tuesday found 63% of respondents,
including 78% of Democrats and 49% of Republicans, would be more likely
to back candidates who support abortion rights in November]{.underline}.

[Democrats contend the clear-and-present danger to reproductive rights
will galvanize independent voters, particularly suburban women and women
without college degrees, to vote for their candidates.]{.underline}

\"There\'s going to be a whole swath of voters who may not consistently
vote for Democratic candidates, but who will be really animated around
the dramatic change in the landscape for abortion access,\" said Kristin
Ford, a spokesperson for NARAL Pro-Choice America.

NARAL said it had seen a \"big uptick\" in donations and website traffic
since the news broke late on Monday. Alongside other abortion rights
groups Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Emily\'s List it has announced
a \$150 million investment in spending on the midterm elections, mostly
in swing states and states that will be pivotal to preserving abortion
access across the country.

Anti-abortion groups also plan to use the upcoming court decision - due
by the end of June - to drive turnout. Mallory Carroll, a spokesperson
for Susan B. Anthony List, said the group\'s political action committee
has been on the ground talking to voters in nine battleground states
since last summer.

\"If this draft opinion\... is resemblant of the final opinion, this
will be a huge encouragement to the pro-life movement because it will
reflect a return on investment of our political engagement these last 50
years,\" Carroll said. \"I think that it\'s going to mobilize people on
both sides.\"

ECONOMY STILL TOP CONCERN?

Geoffrey Skelley, an elections analyst for the website FiveThirtyEight,
was skeptical the abortion issue would be enough to improve the chances
of Democrats holding onto the House and the Senate.

\"[Midterm elections are still mostly about the president and the
president\'s party, and Joe Biden has approval ratings in the low
40s]{.underline},\" he said.

Skelley said he expected the economy, jobs and inflation to remain the
top concerns for many voters, including those who support abortion
rights.

[The prospects could be better for Democrats in state governor\'s
races]{.underline}, he said. Should the Supreme Court overturn Roe, the
legality of abortion will be left to individual states. read more

[Both Michigan\'s Gretchen Whitmer and Wisconsin\'s Tony Evers are up
for reelection. Their Republican opponents oppose abortion rights and
would support legislative efforts in those states to ban the
procedure.]{.underline}

\"I promise you this[: I will fight like hell to make sure abortion
remains safe, legal, and accessible in our state,\" Whitmer
said]{.underline} on Twitter on Monday.

The nonpartisan University of Virginia Center for Politics suggests
there could be a voter backlash in states including Arizona, New
Hampshire, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, where support for abortion
rights is strong but where Republicans are seeking to curb them.

The issue also could boost Democrat Stacey Abrams in Georgia, who
narrowly lost to Governor Brian Kemp four years ago.

\"If you were looking for a message to reactivate the suburbs in
Georgia, this is a great one,\" said Jared Leopold, a former aide to the
Democratic Governors Association.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. --- [[The S]{.mark}upreme [C]{.mark}ourt's decision
[overturning Roe]{.mark} v. Wade]{.underline} on Friday catapulted the
explosive battle over abortion rights into the center of several marquee
midterm races, [turning the fight over key governor's contests and
coveted Senate seats into heated debates]{.underline} about personal
freedom and public health. [Devastated [Democrats, facing staggering
political challenges amid high inflation and]{.mark} President [Biden's
low]{.mark} approval [ratings]{.mark} , hoped the decision might
reinvigorate disaffected base voters]{.underline}. [They also [saw the
moment as a]{.mark} fresh [chance to hold on to]{.mark} the [moderate,
suburban swing voters who]{.mark} have [helped them win]{.mark} recent
elections. Republicans, for their part, publicly celebrated the ruling
as the realization of a decades-long effort,]{.underline} even as some
strategists --- and former President Donald J. Trump --- privately
acknowledged that the issue created at least some risk for a party that
has enjoyed months of political momentum. Many argued that competitive
races would ultimately be decided by other issues. "From the grass-roots
perspective, there's a lot of joy," said Scott Jennings, a Republican
who is a former top campaign aide to Senator Mitch McConnell, the
minority leader. "This is why we fight. And at the same time, this
election is going to be decided on a couple of issues: Joe Biden's
approval rating, inflation, the economy, crime, quality of life." For
years, the prospect of overturning Roe v. Wade was an abstract concept
for many Americans --- a distressing but distant worry for some and a
long-term goal rather than an imminent possibility to others. The
Supreme Court's opinion eliminating the constitutional right to an
abortion ended that era of disbelief, opening a new chapter of concrete
consequences, in which races for governor, state legislature and
attorney general, and even state courts might determine whether millions
of Americans have access to the procedure. "This fall, Roe is on the
ballot," Mr. Biden said on Friday. "Personal freedoms are on the
ballot." Both parties agree that the high stakes will be galvanizing, to
some degree, to their respective bases. [But the critical question
remains whether [swing voters --- in particular, independent women
from]{.mark} the diverse suburbs, who are [currently]{.mark} [focused on
econ]{.mark}omic uncertainty --- [will]{.mark} turn their attention to
the [fight over access to abortion]{.mark}.]{.underline} "There are a
lot of independent women, I think there are a lot of women who haven't
been participating in elections, and are going to engage," Gov. Gretchen
Whitmer of Michigan said in an interview earlier this week, after
hosting an emotional round table focused on abortion rights at a brewery
in Grand Rapids. "But I'm not going to assume it. We're going to have to
make sure that we're doing the work of education and persuasion and
activation." [Already this year, Democratic campaigns and supportive
outside groups have spent nearly \$18 million in advertising on abortion
issues, while Republicans and affiliated outside groups have spent
nearly \$21 million, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Both
figures may balloon.]{.underline} Activists and party strategists, who
have been preparing for months to mobilize around this issue, are
focusing in particular on governor's races in Michigan, Wisconsin and
Pennsylvania, three states currently led by Democratic governors, and
places where the outcomes this fall could directly impact the future of
abortion rights after the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization
decision handed control over abortion protections back to the states.
[[Candidates and organizations]{.mark} have [employed focus
grou]{.mark}ps and polling [to assess the issue]{.mark}; there are
[sprawling fund-]{.mark}raising [efforts]{.mark}; and the [abortion
rights groups Planned Parenthood Action Fund, NARAL Pro-Choice America
and Emily's List]{.mark} have said they [intend to spend \$150 million
on]{.mark} the [midterm]{.mark} election[s.]{.mark} American Bridge 21st
Century, a Democratic-aligned super PAC, says it has tapped social media
influencers to communicate about abortion rights and Republican records
on that issue to Americans who may be only casually
political.]{.underline} "We will see, state by state by state,
pre-existing bans go into effect, state legislatures rush to pass
abortion bans," said Cecile Richards, the former president of Planned
Parenthood who is now a chair of American Bridge. "It's a different
conversation now because it's become real." Despite all the
mobilization, many party strategists do not anticipate that even
Friday's seismic decision will fundamentally change voters' focus on
cost-of-living worries. But [some see it as [reinforcing]{.mark} their
c[ore argument against Republicans:]{.mark} that [the right]{.mark} wing
of the party [is in control, out]{.mark} [of step with public
opinion]{.mark}, and [focused above all else on cultural
battles]{.mark}. Senate [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} and strategists
[are]{.mark} particularly [focused on highlighting]{.mark} the
[Repub]{.mark}lican candidate[s]{.mark} [who support near-total
bans]{.mark} on abortion.]{.underline} "Economic issues are always going
to outweigh abortion for a lot of voters," said Celinda Lake, a veteran
Democratic strategist. "[[But it's very, very important for Democrats
--- to win these swing voters --- to make this a choice, not a
referendum." Abortion, she said, "is going to be a major factor in that,
because it is a very clear distinction."]{.mark}]{.underline} Polling
shows that Americans strongly oppose completely overturning Roe v. Wade
--- in a Washington Post-ABC poll conducted in late April, 54 percent of
Americans thought the Roe decision should be upheld, while 28 percent
believed it should be overturned. But views on abortion vary depending
on a state's political tilt. That is one [reason [Repub]{.mark}lican[s'
messaging]{.mark} on the issue [has been less unified]{.mark}. On
Friday, as some candidates, lawmakers and the Republican National
Committee rushed to celebrate the ruling, others sought to quickly
return their focus to pocketbook issues. Adam Laxalt[, the]{.mark}
Republican [Senate candidate]{.mark} [in Nevada]{.mark} --- a state with
a history of supporting abortion rights --- on Friday [cheered]{.mark}
the "historic [victory for]{.mark} the sanctity of [life," but
stressed]{.mark} that [access to abortion]{.mark} [was]{.mark} already
"[settled law]{.mark}" in Nevada.]{.underline} "It won't distract voters
from unaffordable prices, rising crime or the border crisis," he said.
[When asked for comment, Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the Republican
Governors Association, responded in a statement that "the persuadable
voters that will determine the outcome in competitive races are deeply
concerned with the damage being done to their financial security" by
Democrats[. Even]{.mark} Mr. [Trump]{.mark}, the former president who
put conservatives on the court, has [privately told]{.mark} people that
[he]{.mark} [believes the court's]{.mark} [decision will be "bad for
Republicans.]{.mark}" [In]{.mark} a [public statement]{.mark} on Friday,
Mr. [Trump called the decision]{.mark} "[the biggest WIN for
LIFE]{.mark} in a generation."]{.underline} Abortion rights opponents
are working to capitalize on conservatives' enthusiasm. The
anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America launched a
field program last year, with plans to engage eight million voters in
critical battleground states. The group is focusing on "those people
that are in play, that could go either way based on this particular
issue," said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the organization.
"It's not just some theoretical vote about somebody who says they're
pro-life," she said. "It's now an opportunity to actually do something
about it." Penny Nance, the president of Concerned Women for America, an
organization that opposes abortion rights, said the group was planning a
summit that would focus on the role of state activism in a post-Roe
nation. Some state officials have "basically said, 'We don't really have
the ability to change the law because of the Supreme Court decision,'"
she said. "Now," she continued, "it changes everything." That new focus
on state laws has already intensified the debate in statehouses and
governor's races in politically divided states. In Pennsylvania, the
next governor and a Republican-led statehouse will likely determine
access. "Roe v. Wade is rightly relegated to the ash heap of history,"
said Doug Mastriano, the far-right Republican nominee for governor in
Pennsylvania. Josh Shapiro, the state attorney general and the
Democratic nominee for governor, wrote on Twitter on Friday that
"without Roe, the only thing stopping them is the veto pen of our next
Governor." In Michigan, abortion rights supporters are working to secure
a constitutional amendment protecting the right to an abortion. Ms.
Whitmer has also filed a lawsuit asking "the Michigan Supreme Court to
immediately resolve" whether the State Constitution protectAt her
roundtable discussion this week, Ms. Whitmer spoke with women about
whether they thought voters had yet grasped the significance of what
overturning Roe v. Wade would mean. "So many people," one attendee told
her, "didn't realize it was this serious."

##### Overturning the 50-year precedent of Roe v. Wade is bad news for the Republican Party and for the conservative majority on the high court.

[[For every action, there is a reaction]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
court's revocation of a constitutional right that women have had for
half a century sent shockwaves through the system. A national poll
conducted after the official release of the decision for The PBS News
Hour and National Public Radio by Marist University demonstrated the
degree of damage to the court and the GOP. [[Most Americans disapprove
of the high court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.]{.underline}
[Almost half of the public strongly disapproves of the
verdict.]{.underline}]{.mark} [The public hostility to [the ruling has
put a dent in GOP prospects for the midterms]{.mark}. It is hardly a
surprise that just about every Democrat opposes the decision, while four
of every five Republicans support it.]{.underline} But [the key finding
is that most independents --- who are the swing voters in elections ---
disapprove of the high court's verdict]{.underline}. What is even more
telling is the effect that the case could have on turnout in November.
[[Up until now, Democratic enthusiasm for voting in the midterms lagged
compared to interest among GOP voters]{.mark}. But Democratic voters are
far more likely than Republicans to indicate the Dobbs decision will
drive them to the polls in November. [Women want a choice, and this
gives Democrats a chance to win the midterms.]{.mark} Women are 18
points more likely to support a "pro-choice" congressional candidate
than an "anti-abortion" candidate.]{.underline} Three out of every four
suburban women say they worry that the Supreme Court decision to
overturn Roe could lead it to block other legal rights like
contraception. In the wake of the decision, Democrats have a 7-point
advantage in the national generic congressional trial heat. This is a
10-point swing from April when the GOP had a three-point edge. The big
swing toward Democrats in the last few months is a crystal-clear
indicator of how volatile the political climate is four months before
the midterms. Political pundits have written off Democratic chances of
retaining control of Congress. But the shock waves from the Dobbs case
--- as well as the new revelations from the House investigation of
former President Trump's behavior leading up to and during the failed
Jan. 6 Capitol coup attempt --- could blunt GOP prospects in November.
The mixture of outrage over Trump's encouragement of the attackon the
Capitol and the court's decision to gut reproductive rights could be too
much for voters at the ballot box this fall. To regain their momentum in
the midterms and to counter the political damage from rising inflation
as well as President Biden's problematic approval rating, Democrats must
put Republicans on the defensive. They should aggressively press their
advantage from the reversal of Roe. This strategy means pressing GOP
candidates on their reaction to the loss of reproductive rights for
women and holding Republican officials responsible for the care for the
health and well-being of young children. Democratic candidates should
put their GOP counterparts on the spot and ask them whether they support
former Vice President Mike Pence's proposal for a national abortion ban.
Michael Steele, the former chair of the Republican National Committee,
predicts that Senate Republicans will abolish the filibuster rule if
they gain control of Congress to pass a national abortion ban. The
political damage extends to the Supreme Court[. The six justices
appointed by Republican presidents all supported the decision. [By a 57
percent-to-36 percent margin Americans believe the Dobbs decision was
based on politics instead of the law]{.mark}.]{.underline} Back in 2019,
six out of every 10 people had confidence in the Supreme Court. Now only
four in 10 do. To counter abortion ruling, shift from recriminations
toward development/ We need U.S. industry to counter the next global
food crisis. The lack of public confidence in Supreme Court could
encourage "pro-choice" proponents of abortion rights voters and public
officials to minimize the impact that Roe's reversal will have on women.
Several Democratic governors have already offered help to women who
cannot receive safe and legal abortions in their home states. The
Supreme Court has rolled back decades of progress for women's rights.
The dust is still settling from the disastrous decision, but the early
returns prove what many already knew[. [The reversal of Roe is a cross
that women will need to bear and a be a thorn in the side of the

Former President Trump's plans to announce his 2024 presidential
campaign as early as this summer, well before what he previously
indicated, throws a wrench into Republicans' strategy for winning back
the Senate and House majorities in November. Senate Minority Leader
Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy
(R-Calif.) made clear they want the 2022 midterms to be a referendum on
President Biden and his handling of inflation and the economy. But that
strategy will run into trouble if Trump announces his plans to run for
president again in 2022. An early Trump campaign kickoff would give
plenty of opportunity for Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer
(D-N.Y.) and other Democrats to make November a referendum on Trump
instead of Biden. **[Republican and Democratic strategists say [Trump
will also provide a shot of energy and motivation to a dispirited
Democratic base]{.mark} that right now feels less enthusiastic than
Republicans about voting in the midterms.]{.underline}** "Midterm
elections tend to be referenda on the governing party and given
President Biden's rock-bottom job approval rating, anything that
detracts from a focus on the Biden administration and its many failures

Ayres, a leading Republican pollster. [[Biden's]{.mark} job

more motivated than Democrats to vote given liberal disappointment over
the Biden agenda. "No question about it. The administration has managed
to increase Republican enthusiasm and depress Democratic enthusiasm by
the way it has governed," he said. Former Rep. Jim Walsh (R), who
represented a swing district in upstate New York, said a Trump 2024
announcement could hurt Republican candidates in competitive races. "I
think it causes problems for Republicans. If Trump were to announce this
summer, I think it definitely causes problems for Republicans," he said.
Walsh said if Trump launches his campaign, "it's not going to bring
Republicans out this election but what it may do is motivate Democrats."

economy and quality of life. That's an unassailable fact,"]{.underline}

past campaigns. But Jennings said analysts can't assume "Donald Trump
cares about whether Republicans win the midterms or not." "His tactical
objectives here are different than the party's and he's never shown much
of an interest in what's best of the party in this regard," he added.
Many Senate Republicans blamed Trump for contributing to their loss of
two Senate seats in last year's election runoff in Georgia because he
claimed fraud in the 2020 November election, depressing GOP turnout in
the following January runoff. "Case in point the Georgia special we had
in January of last year. Trump gave no thought whatsoever to what it
meant to tell Republicans their vote no longer counted," Jennings
pointed out. [McConnell on Tuesday hammered Biden's successful push for

trillion \[dollars\] on the economy," he said during remarks to the
Paducah Area Chamber of Commerce, echoing what has become his midterm
election message. McConnell regularly deflects questions about Trump and
his actions in the run-up to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol when asked
by reporters, usually replying that he's paying more attention to the
issues immediately before the Senate. Jennings predicted that McConnell
and other Republicans will find a way to adapt if Trump launches his
White House campaign early, even if it's not an ideal scenario. He also
said that Democrats were always planning on making Trump central to
their midterm campaign message for the Senate and House, even though
Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe's effort to do just that in the
Virginia 2021 gubernatorial race failed to earn him a victory. Ford
O'Connell, a GOP strategist who was close to the Trump White House,

##### GOP Infighting Will Doom Republicans in Midterms

against Republican Party censure of Trump critics"  [Reuters

2022 

WASHINGTON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Top U.S. Senate Republican Mitch McConnell
on Tuesday criticized his party\'s censure of two prominent Republican
critics of Donald Trump, joining an [intra-party battle that could upend
his efforts to project an image of party moderation in this year\'s
midterm elections]{.underline}. Last week, the Republican National
Committee censured Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, the
only two Republicans serving on the House of Representatives select
committee investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters of
then-President Trump stormed the Capitol in a failed attempt to prevent
Congress from certifying President Joe Biden\'s 2020 election victory.
\"The issue is whether or not the RNC should be sort of singling out
members of our party who may have different views from the majority.
That\'s not the job of the RNC,\" McConnell told a news conference. The
RNC took its action on Friday, calling the Democratic-led committee\'s
inquiry an attack on \"legitimate political discourse.\" McConnell
rejected that description, saying, \"We saw what happened. It was a
violent insurrection for the purpose of trying to prevent the peaceful
transfer of power after a legitimately certified election from one
administration to the next. That\'s what it was.\" \\ The controversy
comes as **[Republicans are hoping to regain majorities in the House and
Senate in the Nov. 8 midterm elections.]{.underline}** McConnell, the
Senate minority leader and one of his party\'s most wily political
tacticians, has been trying to paint Biden as a former moderate
radicalized by the Democratic Party\'s left wing. **[Projecting an image
of moderation for the Republicans could help the party\'s Senate
candidates in key states.]{.underline}** \\\\ Lawmakers close to
McConnell have found themselves on the defensive about the RNC censure
resolution. \"They said, in the resolution, they wanted Republicans to
be unified. That was not a unifying action,\" said Senator John Cornyn
of Texas. Senate Republican leaders were quick to acknowledge the
trouble that party divisions might pose for Republican Senate
candidates. \"If we **[want to win the elections in November, there are
better things for us to be focused on,\" said Senator John Thune, the
chamber\'s No. 2 Republican after McConnell. \"The focus right now needs
to be forward, not backward. If we want to get majorities in the fall,
then it\'s better to turn our fire on Democrats and not on each
other,\"]{.underline}** Thune added. Others pointed to Senate Republican
criticism of the RNC as a problem for candidates in some states.
\"Whatever you think about the RNC vote, it reflects the view of most
Republicans,\" said Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican who
objected to 2020 election results on Jan. 6. \"In my state, it\'s not
helpful to have a bunch of D.C. Republicans commenting on the RNC\...
super unhelpful,\" he said. Democrats may be vulnerable in November,
particularly considering Biden\'s falling public approval numbers in
opinion polls. The party of sitting presidents typically loses
congressional seats in the first midterm elections after winning the
White House. McConnell has sought to cast Biden and his pricy \"Build
Back Better\" social spending plan that is stalled in the Senate as
creatures of the Democratic Party\'s left wing. McConnell has accused
Biden of ignoring troubles facing American families such as inflation,
including higher energy costs. \"If the president starts acting like a
moderate, like he campaigned, we can do business,\" McConnell told Fox
News last month. While McConnell is calling for bipartisanship, he often
has been a partisan warrior himself. As majority leader, he refused to
consider Democratic President Barack Obama\'s nominee to fill a Supreme
Court vacancy and last year said he might block Biden\'s nominees to the
high court if Republicans gain Senate control. He also has used the
Senate\'s filibuster rule to thwart parts of Biden\'s legislative
agenda, including voting rights. McConnell did deliver critical
Republican votes last year for two bipartisan priorities - a \$1
trillion infrastructure bill and a deal to avert a default on the
federal government\'s debt. Both prompted enraged statements from Trump,
who has called for McConnell\'s ouster from his Senate leadership post.

(CNN)Election Day 2022 is now four months away. Democrats are trying to
hold on to slim majorities in both the House and Senate. They\'re doing
so [against the
backdrop](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/05/politics/biden-economy-midterms-poll-blame/index.html)
of high inflation and an economy viewed in poor shape, which is the
issue dominating voters\' minds. I\'ve generally been high on
Republicans\' chances of taking [control of the
Senate](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/12/politics/ron-johnson-republicans-senate-2022-analysis/index.html)
and [especially the
House](https://www.facebook.com/cnn/videos/democrats-are-in-a-lot-of-trouble-harry-enten-on-2022-midterms/309399197712219/).
You [don\'t normally
see](https://news.gallup.com/poll/393626/usual-midterm-indicators-unfavorable-democrats.aspx)
the party controlling the White House do well in midterms when the
President\'s approval rating is in the high 30s. But can Democrats defy
political gravity and retain power, even with an unpopular [Joe
Biden](https://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/joe-biden-news) in office?
The answer in the House is likely not, but the answer in the currently
evenly divided Senate is far less clear. And it\'s in the upper chamber
where we begin our look at the political news of the week. [[Don\'t
write off the Senate Democrats just yet]{.mark} Perhaps, the biggest
polling shock this past week came from [the [state of
Georgia](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/24/politics/herschel-walker-raphael-warnock-georgia-senate-race/index.html)]{.mark}.
A [Quinnipiac University
poll](https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3851) found [Democratic
Sen. Raphael Warnock with a 10-point lead over Republican Herschel
Walker]{.mark}, 54% to 44%]{.underline}. The result was far better for
Warnock than the [long-term average for the
race](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/)
(which has either candidate up by a point or two, depending on how the
average is calculated). But even the average indicates that Warnock
could win, despite Biden\'s approval rating being well below 40% in the
Peach State. The Georgia race is among several in 2020 battleground
states that the national environment suggests should be leaning
Republicans but polling on the ground suggests otherwise. It\'s an
indication that the outcome for Senate control isn\'t close to being
finalized. The 2022 Senate map is rather small. Of the 35 seats up this
cycle, I would categorize less than 10 of them at this point as
competitive \-- i.e., where each side has a better than 10% chance of
winning. A few races could make the difference either way. I base that
assessment off a [simple data
model](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/02/politics/senate-landscape/index.html)
that looks at state-level polling, national indicators (i.e., the
generic congressional ballot and the President\'s approval rating), the
past presidential vote, whether the election was a midterm or not, and
expert race ratings (by, say, [the Cook Political
Report](https://www.cookpolitical.com/)). All told, the model indicates
that the most likely outcome is for Republicans to pick up a seat or
two. That\'s enough for a majority, as the GOP needs a net gain of just
a seat for control. Considering past errors of the model, it suggests
that Republicans have a roughly 3-in-5 shot at winning back the Senate.
The reason the model is so high on Senate Democrats compared with what
you might expect given the national environment is simple: the
state-level polling in swing states[. [Recent public data has looked
surprisingly strong for Democrats in places such as
[Arizona](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/arizona/),
Georgia,
[Nevada](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/nevada/),
[New
Hampshire](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/new-hampshire/)
and
[Pennsylvania](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/pennsylvania/).]{.mark}
[I]{.mark}n fact, Democrats would be favored if we didn\'t take into
account the Republican lead on the generic ballot, Biden\'s low approval
rating and the tendency for the opposition party\'s lead to grow during
midterm elections.]{.underline} State-level polling averages at this
point in a midterm year has been fairly predictive of the actual fall
result since 2006 (with an average difference of a little more than 6
points). It\'s not all that different from state polling averages during
the final weeks of a campaign (which have an [average absolute
error](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/pollster-ratings)
of a little less than 5 points). On the other hand, Republicans would be
favored to pick up three Senate seats, if we ignored the state polling
and concentrated on the President\'s approval rating and expert ratings
for each seat. It is possible that this estimate could be closer to the
truth. Senate Republicans could even do better and pick up five seats. I
will admit that the 2-in-5 chance of Democrats maintaining Senate
control was a surprisingly high percentage. (Although the model is very
slightly more bullish on Republicans than the percentages pumped out by
the far more complicated [FiveThirtyEight
model](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/).)
After all, the model is trained on past years when there were a number
of close Senate races at this point that ended up swinging wildly toward
Republicans. Senate contests such as [Arkansas in
2014](https://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-arkansas-senate-cotton-vs-pryor),
[Indiana in
2016](https://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-indiana-senate-young-vs-bayh),
[Missouri in
2018](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2018/missouri/)
and [Montana in
2020](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2020/montana/)
jump out in my mind. All were fairly tight at this point, according to
the polls, and all were won by the Republican candidates by at least 5
points, if not upward of 15 points, when all the votes were counted.
Here\'s the thing though: The vast majority of races in which
Republicans were vastly outperforming their polling at this point were
places that heavily tilted toward the GOP in [national
elections](https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/). With perhaps the
exception of Ohio (though the model doesn\'t view that Senate race as
all that competitive), all the states with key Senate elections this
year were competitive in the 2020 presidential race. So why the big
difference between national indicators and state-level polling? It could
be that the latter is wrong. But think about who the Republican nominees
are or are likely to be in places such as Arizona (Blake Masters),
Georgia (Walker) and Pennsylvania (Mehmet Oz). All are seen as weaker
candidates, with the latter two having what most observers view as
considerable baggage. The question is whether that baggage will be
enough to keep them out of the Senate with such an unpopular President
in office and an economy viewed by voters as weak. Republicans look
strong in race for the House One reason to be skeptical of Senate
Democrats\' chances is what is going on in the race for the House.
Republicans have maintained a position on the generic congressional
ballot better than in any midterm at this point [since the 1938
cycle](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/25/politics/republicans-congress-polling-roe-v-wade/index.html).
Remember, Republicans only need a net gain of four seats for House
control. There is every reason to think they will get it. The
macro-indicators look strong for Republicans. Beyond their 2-point
advantage on the generic ballot, Biden\'s approval rating is below 40%.
There has never been a president with such a [low approval
rating](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/)
whose party didn\'t lose at least four seats in a midterm election. The
White House party sees minimal midterm losses or gains when the
president has an approval rating north of 60%. Biden\'s low approval
rating makes sense given that inflation and the economy are viewed as
the top issues. Consumer sentiment is low. The [University of
Michigan\'s consumer sentiment index](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/)
reading for June was the lowest it has ever been in its 70-year history.
House race ratings by experts at the Cook Political Report and [Inside
Elections](https://insideelections.com/) indicate the same thing. Based
on a model of expert rating data going back to 2000, House Democrats, on
average, would lose around 25 seats if the election were held today.
This would give Republicans somewhere around 240 House seats in the next
Congress. You might be wondering how the House and the Senate estimates
could end up being so different. Both are federal elections, which are
increasingly influenced by how voters feel about the president. One
explanation is that it\'s all a mirage. The two outcomes could end up
converging. Another is [that [there is a history of Democrats doing
better in Senate races, even in unfriendly terrain]{.mark}. [Democrats
won Senate seats in deep-red Montana and West Virginia [in
2018](https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2020&f=0&off=3&elect=0)]{.mark},
even though Democratic House candidates in those states didn\'t succeed.
[The correlation between feelings toward the president and the way
people vote is high, but it\'s lower in [Senate
races](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-were-no-purple-states-on-tuesday/)
than it is for [House
contests](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cde0368c-255c-4605-a64d-6870b1167800/psq12724-fig-0005-m.jpg).]{.mark}
The truth is that one or two great or awful candidates can sink a
party\'s chance of winning the Senate when there are only 35 races. That
may just happen this year.]{.underline} One or two great or awful
candidates are very unlikely to sink a party\'s chance of winning the
House when there are 435 races, however.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/29/nato-republicans-trump/

In early 2019, several months after President Donald Trump threatened to
upend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization during a trip to Brussels
for the alliance's annual summit, House lawmakers passed the NATO
Support Act amid overwhelming bipartisan support, with only 22
Republicans voting against the measure. But this month, when a similar
bill in support of NATO during the Russian invasion of Ukraine again
faced a vote in the House, the support was far more polarized, with 63
Republicans --- 30 percent of the party's conference --- voting against
it. The vote underscores the Republican Party's remarkable drift away
from NATO in recent years, as positions once considered part of a
libertarian fringe have become doctrine for a growing portion of the
party[. The isolationist posture of some Republicans is in line with the
"America First" ethos of Trump, the GOP's de facto leader, who has long
railed against NATO. Last week, speaking at a Heritage Foundation event
in Florida, Trump implied that as president he had threatened not to
defend NATO allies from Russian attacks as a negotiating tactic to
pressure them to contribute more money toward the organization's shared
defense.]{.underline} The vote also comes against the backdrop of
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has catapulted NATO to its most
prominent role in decades. And it comes as some hawkish Republicans seek
to cast themselves as stronger opponents of Russia than Democrats. Metin
Hakverdi, a German lawmaker who chairs the North America working group
within the ruling Social Democratic Party, said the question that
preoccupies him is, "Was Donald Trump the exception, or will Joe Biden
be the exception?" [Some two dozen House GOP lawmakers who voted for the
2019 NATO Support Act voted against the similar resolution this month,
which reaffirmed support for the alliance and its principles. But in
interviews, several of those House Republicans said they still support
the organization and simply objected to what they viewed as problematic
provisions that Democrats had added to the bill for perceived political
purposes. Several who switched their votes since 2019 objected to
measures they said did not specifically address strengthening NATO to
help Ukraine. Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) found it particularly
problematic that the resolution instructed NATO to be involved when a
country has "internal threats from proponents on illiberalism," which he
says could be interpreted as conservatism. "I am a huge supporter of
NATO --- I served in the Air Force during the Cold War, worked with NATO
during that time period," he said.]{.underline} "These issues should be
left to those individual nations." NATO Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg, center left, speaks with President Donald Trump after a
group photo at a 2019 NATO leaders meeting in England. (Francisco
Seco/AP) Loudermilk argued that Democrats had inserted "poison pills"
into the symbolic resolution, which could be used against Republicans in
the 2022 midterms[. "It was the Democrats trying to politicize something
and add things in there that we have no business working on," he said,
explaining his vote against the bill.]{.underline} Donald Trump\'s
effort to rewrite history on his support of NATO and Ukraine Similarly,
from Rep. Robert B. Aderholt (R-Ala.): "I am wholeheartedly,
unequivocally, without reservation, supportive on NATO." But Aderholt
said he worried that the resolution "had some language in that I thought
went on the political side. And I don't want to see NATO go political. I
want to see NATO stand up for, you know, what's going on in Ukraine ---
stand up for Ukraine against Russia." The two bills are not exactly the
same. The legislation in 2019 reaffirmed that federal money should not
be used to remove the United States from NATO --- which Trump was
threatening at the time --- while the bill from this month called on the
government to "uphold the founding democratic principles of NATO," as
well for NATO "to continue to provide unwavering support to the people
of Ukraine as they fight for their sovereignty, territorial integrity,
and a democratic future[." Another sign of the party's isolationist wing
emerged Thursday, as the House passed an update to a World War II-era
military bill creating a lend-lease program intended to make it easier
for the United States to supply Ukraine with military aid. Only 10
lawmakers **--- all Republicans --- voted against the
measure**]{.underline}. In an exchange earlier in the week between
Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was testifying before Congress,
and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Paul pushed back on Blinken's assertion that
over the years Russia has shown a willingness to attack countries like
Georgia that are not part of NATO, while giving wider berth to countries
that are members of the alliance. Rand Paul suggests NATO expansion
provoked Russia 2:36 Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky[.) on April 26 said while
there was no "justification" for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, there
were "reasons" for the invasion. (Video: Reuters) "You could also argue
the countries they've attacked were part of Russia, or were part of the
Soviet Union," said Paul, who was one of just two senators who voted
against a 2018 bill reaffirming support for a NATO, in what was at the
time a pointed rebuke of Trump.]{.underline} "Yes, and I firmly disagree
with that proposition," Blinken responded. For some foreign policy
experts and international allies, the mere fact that nearly one-third of
the Republican conference voted against a bill that fundamentally seeks
to support both NATO and Ukraine highlights a marked foreign policy
evolution in the Republican Party. "We now are really seeing the true
impact of deep, deep political polarization, where it is better to harm
the other side than do what's right for the country," said Heather
Conley, president of the German Marshall Fund. "This deep domestic
polarization has now crept into foreign and security policy. There has
always been strong bipartisan support for NATO, but everything now has
become polarized and can be weaponized against the other side, even if
it supports U.S. national security interests." President Biden speaks at
a March 24, 2022, news conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels after
meeting with allies about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Evan
Vucci/AP) Many European diplomats breathed a sigh of relief when
President Biden, a staunch Atlanticist, denied Trump another term in
2020. Now, 16 months later, Biden's role in marshaling Western allies
behind Ukraine --- and his recent vow to protect "every inch of NATO
territory" --- has alleviated doubt in Europe about U.S. commitments, at
least in the short term. But Europeans who were heartened by the outcome
of the last American election are beginning to eye upcoming contests,
including this year's midterms and the 2024 presidential race. [Their
apprehension about a Republican takeover of Congress, which could revive
Trump's brand of foreign policy, is offset by hope that Russia's
invasion of Ukraine will strengthen the Republican Party's
internationalist wing and compel the party to lock arms with
Europe]{.underline}. "I'm very concerned about the situation in America
--- the split of the society, the concentration on domestic issues, the
underestimation of the importance of America's international role," said
Thomas de Maizière, a former center-right lawmaker and high-ranking
government minister in Germany who co-chaired a NATO working group
convened in 2020. "But there are Republicans we work excellently with,
and I would expect them to take on a larger role if their party takes
power." Whether that assessment reflects an accurate reading of
Republican politics is an open question. The answer, however, is
existential in Europe, where the fallout from the war in Ukraine has
showcased the importance of the United States and the limits of
aspirations for European autonomy on matters of technology and defense,
according to lawmakers and diplomats. Flash points are already coming
into view. In 2020, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg started a
working group aimed at strengthening NATO. The group's final product,
"NATO 2030: United for a New Era," included proposals, such as the
creation of a Center for Democratic Resilience, that have been scorned
by pro-Trump Republicans, including many of the 63 Republicans who
recently voted against the House resolution affirming support for NATO.
Biden at war: Inside a deliberate yet impulsive Ukraine strategy The
outcome of that vote surprised even Trump's former ambassador to NATO,
Kay Bailey Hutchison, who argued that the U.S. commitment to the
alliance has remained ironclad across administrations, despite bellicose
rhetoric. "I was nonplussed by that vote," she said in an interview. A
diplomat from a Baltic state, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to
avoid alienating U.S. partners, called the vote a "Trump effect." "But
how many voted for it?" the diplomat added. "The mainstream is clearly
in favor of NATO and strengthening NATO." Similarly, Sen. Thom Tillis
(R-N.C.), the co-chair of the Senate NATO Observer Group, who just
returned from a trip to the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, said
the recent Republican votes against NATO were "poorly timed," but he
dismissed the 63 House Republicans as an "inconsequential" number. Amid
the war in Ukraine, Tillis said, "this is a time where the alliance has
really proven its mettle." Another European diplomat said the war in
Ukraine has caused European nations to address some of the complaints
leveled by Trump, including insufficient spending on defense and
reliance on Russian oil and gas. Those were the two issues raised by the
former president when he criticized Stoltenberg at an alliance summit in
2018. ADVERTISING "It should no longer be a big issue for his
supporters," the diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity
to be candid on a sensitive issue. But for some, the changes are not
enough. Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), who voted against the recent
resolution, said he objected not to NATO but to its future direction,
which in his view places too large a burden on the United States and
involves too much promotion of specific values. The resolution's
affirmation of "unequivocal support" risks being mistaken for
unconditional support, Davidson said. When asked whether he could
envision the United States exiting the alliance --- as Trump considered
with former advisers --- Davidson said the real issue is rather whether
other member nations who are not spending sufficiently on defense should
leave the club. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) during a Senate Foreign Relations
Committee hearing in which he challenged Secretary of State Antony
Blinken on Ukraine policy on April 26, 2022. (Al Drago/Bloomberg News)
"Is there a point where America would consider pulling out? It's
something we should discuss," said Davidson, an Army veteran who was
stationed in Germany when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. "The better
question is whether there's a point where we would say to other member
countries, 'This might not be your place --- you're disinvited.'"
Davidson said he objected in particular to the resolution's endorsement
of the Center for Democratic Resilience, which he called an "entity
designed to meddle in other countries' domestic politics." Disagreements
have broken out among member nations over the erosion of democracy
within the alliance, with criticism directed in particular at Turkey,
Hungary and Poland. A Central European diplomat said objections to the
democracy center reflect admiration for the likes of Hungary's Viktor
Orban in other Western nations. [De Maizière echoed that view, saying
his primary concern about upcoming U.S. elections was that "right-wing
Republicans are drifting away from this common path of Western values."
"But I have confidence that you more or less win elections in the middle
in America, not at the extremes," he added. "**In the
end,**]{.underline} perhaps [**Biden will lose Congress,** but I don't
see Trump again as president."]{.underline} Biden says Putin \'cannot
remain in power\' in forceful speech in Poland Radoslaw Sikorski, a
Polish member of the European Parliament who chairs the body's
delegation for relations with the United States, said Ukraine "is the
second big issue on which Republicans and Democrats agree, after China."
"Ukraine has given new credibility to the Atlanticist wing of the
Republican Party, which I find encouraging," said Sikorski, a member of
his country's centrist Civic Platform party and a prominent critic of
the ruling, right-wing Law and Justice party. "There seems to be
competition in being pro-Ukrainian and wanting to stop Putin." Rep.
Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), the co-chair of the Congressional Ukrainian
Caucus and the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Europe
subcommittee, said a significant portion of House Republicans are "more
libertarian in their foreign policy," a position with which he
disagrees. "We're certainly going to have a lot of these talks with my
colleagues, particularly next cycle, if there's any assault on NATO that
is launched," Fitzpatrick said. "I will tell you that NATO needs to be
reformed significantly. But it is absolutely critical that it be
maintained because without NATO, dictators are going to, it's going to
be the Wild West internationally." Tommy Vietor, a National Security
Council spokesman under Democratic President Barack Obama, said: "It's a
pretty shocking turn." "There's an appropriate and important
conversation to be had about the history of NATO expansion and whether
it was well-thought-through," said Vietor, now a co-host of "Pod Save
America." "But you didn't see people in either party really
fundamentally questioning the value of the alliance." Seung Min Kim

elected president, I'd expect all of that to dissipate pretty rapidly.
[Both parties]{.mark} will once again be strong supporters of NATO in
particular and of the general overarching direction of U.S. foreign
policy since the 1940s. But [if Trump]{.mark} is [nominated]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} especially if he [wins]{.mark} the presidency, it's [hard
to see the party]{.mark} [working]{.mark} as hard [to constrain]{.mark}
his [foreign-policy]{.mark} choices as it once did. And if Democrats
remain in the White House for another four years (or more)? It's easy to
imagine partisan polarization extending into this area, as it has so
many others, with [Republicans automatically]{.mark} [opposing]{.mark}
[whatever]{.mark} it is that [Democratic]{.mark} [presidents]{.mark} are
[doing]{.mark} --- [including participation in the alliances]{.mark}
that Eisenhower, Nixon, Gerald Ford, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and
George W. Bush all strongly supported. [Preventing]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
result [would require strong]{.mark}, responsible [leadership]{.mark}
[from]{.mark} [Republican]{.mark} politicians. [I'm not optimistic that
will happen.]{.mark}

##### Trumpism and right-wing isolationist opinions are collectively moving the GOP away from NATO -- Republican win in the midterms is going to enable them to ditch NATO altogether.

When it came to public policy[, Donald [Trump's]{.mark}
[presidency]{.mark} [was]{.mark} [marked]{.mark} [by]{.mark} repeated
[defeats]{.mark} [whenever]{.mark} [he]{.mark} [attempted]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [take]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [Republican]{.mark}
[orthodoxy]{.mark}. When he championed tax cuts, the party was right
there with him. When he urged massive spending for infrastructure, they
ignored him. On several foreign-policy questions, including
[Trump]{.mark}'s [antagonis]{.mark}m [toward]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark},
congressional Republicans actively opposed him]{.underline}.
[[Those]{.mark} foreign-policy [issues]{.mark} [reflected]{.mark} the
enduring [triumph]{.mark} [of]{.mark} Dwight
[Eisenhower]{.mark}]{.underline}. Republicans were always
anti-communists. [[But]{.mark} [before]{.mark} Ike,
[conservatives]{.mark} [had]{.mark} also [been]{.mark}
[isolationists]{.mark}, [preferring]{.mark} that the [U.S.]{.mark}
[stay]{.mark} [out]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [world]{.mark}]{.underline},
and especially out of long-term alliances. [Harry Truman had worked
with]{.underline} internationalist Republicans in [Congress to commit
the U.S. to the United Nations, NATO, the Marshall Plan, and
more]{.underline}, but the rank and file was less than comfortable with
all of that, and it wasn't at all clear where a Republican president
would take the party. In fact, Eisenhower only narrowly won the
Republican nomination in 1952, defeating the conservative wing of a
party that was desperate after losing five consecutive presidential
elections and happy to have a war hero leading the ticket. Eisenhower's
popular and effective two-term presidency moved isolationism to the
fringe. His vice president, Richard Nixon, followed his lead during his
own presidency. [[Even]{.mark} [when]{.mark} [conservatives]{.mark}
fully [took]{.mark} [control]{.mark} of the party [with]{.mark} the
[election]{.mark} [of]{.mark} Ronald [Reagan]{.mark}, the [old]{.mark}
[isolationist]{.mark} [impulse]{.mark} [was]{.mark} [reduced]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} occasional [UN-bashing]{.mark}.]{.underline} There were
plenty of real differences on foreign policy between the parties during
the Cold War, but Ike's presidency put Republicans firmly on the side of
an active continuing role for the U.S. in world affairs, including
participation in a series of alliances and agreements. Indeed, that
commitment outlasted the Cold War[. [Trump]{.mark} [didn't]{.mark}
[care]{.mark} much [about]{.mark} [public]{.mark} [policy]{.mark} when
he was president. But [he]{.mark} did [undermine]{.mark} this
[internationalist]{.mark} [consensus]{.mark}, [even]{.mark}
[using]{.mark} the old "[America]{.mark} [First]{.mark}" [slogan]{.mark}
[from]{.mark} an [isolationist]{.mark} (and anti-Semitic)
[movement]{.mark} [from]{.mark} the 19[30s]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
while [[he]{.mark} [had]{.mark} [little]{.mark} [success]{.mark}
actually [implementing]{.mark} his foreign-policy [preferences]{.mark}
--- [as]{.mark} [he]{.mark} [was]{.mark} repeatedly [rolled]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} [Congress]{.mark}, the bureaucracy [and]{.mark}
[allied]{.mark} [nations]{.mark} --- it's quite possible he could have
the last laugh]{.underline}. Earlier this week, **[[an]{.mark}

[remain]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [White House]{.mark} for another four
years (or more)? [It's]{.mark} [easy]{.mark} [to imagine partisan
polarization]{.mark} extending [into this area]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
it has so many others, with Republicans automatically opposing whatever
it is that Democratic presidents are doing --- including participation
in the alliances that Eisenhower, Nixon, Gerald Ford, Reagan, George
H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush all strongly supported. Preventing that
result would require strong, responsible leadership from Republican
politicians. I'm not optimistic that will happen.

##### IL -- NATO is vital to US strategic leadership & American prosperity and Vice Versa 

**McInnis 6/28** Kathleen J. McInnis is a senior fellow in the
International Security Program and the director of the Smart Women,
Smart Power Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies. <https://foreignpolicy.com/author/kathleen-j-mcinnis/> MH

As NATO meets in Madrid this week, the question inevitably arises: Why
does the United States need the alliance in the first place? Why is it
worth risking New York to save Vilnius or Warsaw, capitals of faraway
countries separated from the United States by a wide ocean? The answer
lies in the way NATO has worked, as amply demonstrated in practice, for
the simultaneous advancement of both American and European interests.
Although the U.S. security guarantee for its NATO allies has been at the
heart of the alliance's political-military framework, and [the United
States has spent considerable sums on the maintenance of defense
capabilities as a result, [this has never been a one-way
bargain.]{.mark} These [treaty relationships]{.mark} have [afforded the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates a position of strategic
leadership]{.underline}. [As [a]{.mark} result of America's [central
role in trans-Atlantic and international relations]{.mark} that NATO
cemented, [Americans have enjoyed enormous econ]{.mark}omic [prosperity
and freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}. Put more bluntly: [[Successive
American governments]{.mark} [have been afforded privileged
status]{.mark} [when it]{.mark} has [come to]{.mark} issues including
[trade partnerships and access to bases]{.mark} in large part because of
the outsized role that the United States plays in the defense of its
allies. Nor would the United States have been able to sustain its
significant portfolio of [foreign military sales]{.mark} and [defense
tech]{.mark}nology [coop]{.mark}eration activities without the strategic
foundation laid by its role as NATO's primary security guarantor [for
seven decades]{.mark}]{.underline}. This position of
leadership---manifested in its overseas presence---also [allows the
United States to set the international security agenda in both political
and practical ways. [America would not have been able to]{.mark}, for
example, [prosecute expeditionary and counterterrorism operations in the
Middle East and Africa were it not for]{.mark} the bases and
pre-positioned equipment that the United States has been able to
maintain on [allied soil in Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}. Coalition
operations to stabilize the Balkans or conduct anti-piracy missions off
the Horn of Africa [would not be as comparatively straightforward (or
maybe even possible) without the decades of interoperability
standardization agreements, multinational training exercises, or the
International Military Staff through which allies can]{.underline}
collectively plan for and integrate their military operations.
[[NATO]{.mark}'s structures also [afford U.S.]{.mark} military leaders
direct experience of the complexities of commanding multilateral
military operations]{.underline}. Another long-standing reason for U.S.
engagement in the European theater is to enable U.S. strategic depth.
Labeled "defense in depth" by security practitioners, military
technological developments and adversary operations during the world
wars demonstrated that the United States was no longer protected by the
two oceans off of its shores. As a result, it was deemed strategically
prudent to station U.S. forces overseas in order to be able to contend
with adversary aggression---if not outright conflict---far away from the
American homeland. Not only did this make the American homeland less
vulnerable to outright war, but forward presence was also viewed as
relatively cost-effective---especially given the potentially enormous
social, political, and economic costs of a war on the American
continent. The advent of the nuclear age changed that calculation
somewhat---intercontinental ballistic missiles made the American
homeland vulnerable---but given that even a nuclear war with the Soviet
Union would also likely involve combined arms combat in the European
theater, the logic of defense in depth held. Over the decades, that
rationale has endured even as the strategic context changed. For
example, a primary reason f[or U.S. counterterrorism operations in the
Middle East after the 9/11 attacks was to tackle the root sources of
violent extremist groups]{.underline} before they could again build
sufficient capability and capacity to conduct terrorist attacks against
the U.S. homeland. The [[war in Ukraine, along with]{.mark} the
attendant [concerns about]{.mark} the [security and defense on]{.mark}
the [European]{.mark} continent that [are now
heightened,]{.mark}]{.underline} once again underscore the
importance---and relative cost-effectiveness---of forward military
presence. Moreover, the global political significance of the United
States' track record when it comes to maintaining these alliances over
the long haul can arguably give the United States another kind of depth:
credibility. While the United States' reliability as a security partner
is frequently called into question in response to day-to-day events,
taking a step back it is quite remarkable that U.S. commitments to its
allies in Europe have weathered any number of [geopolitical
storms.]{.underline} The daily management of alliance relationships is a
complicated business, of course. But in constructing and recalibrating
security relationships with other states, including critical ties in
Asia, the U.S. record of building and maintaining a long-standing
alliance helps build credibility with others. More broadly, NATO affords
its members an extraordinary---and extraordinarily important---degree of
strategic flexibility. NATO has proved capable of reinvention, as its
post-Cold War experience showed. From the late 1990s until approximately
2014---and largely as a result of U.S. prompting---NATO was primarily
focused on collective security and crisis management in Europe's near
abroad and the Middle East. Security interests were framed in terms of
promoting global stability and prosperity---including through countering
and dismantling terrorist groups outside NATO allied borders. In other
words, contrary to expectations in the early 1990s[, NATO endured and
evolved to contend with myriad security challenges absent an
overwhelming threat. And, by the way, against this backdrop,
U.S.-European trade remained strong.]{.underline} In 2014, as Russia
annexed Crimea and began waging a proxy war in Ukraine, old adversarial
geopolitics came rushing back. NATO's role as a bulwark against an
expansionist and revisionist power immediately gained renewed salience,
although today the front line is considerably farther eastward than
during the Cold War. Further complicating matters, despite any number of
assurances by Brussels, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has made clear
that it views [NATO's eastward expansion as counter to its own
interests, and it [views]{.mark} the [existence of the alliance itself
as a threat. Yet NATO]{.mark} is managing to both [address the challenge
of a revanchist]{.mark} Russia [and]{.mark} tackle a [broader]{.mark}
array of security [challenges]{.mark} to the alliance, [including China,
climate change, and]{.mark} advanced [disruptive tech]{.mark}nologies.
More broadly, the lines between foreign and domestic policy,
war]{.underline} and peace, civilian and military, public and private
are all being blurred, calling long-standing approaches to contending
with security and defense challenges into question. Nontraditional
security challenges including disinformation operations, pandemic
response, migration, and terrorism have put significant stress on the
governments of allies on both sides of the Atlantic. None of these
challenges can be tackled by one state alone, not even by the United
States. And in these blurry spaces, [NATO can---and has---played an
important role in catalyzing solutions for these complex problems. For
example, NATO played a key role in facilitating the international
community's response to the rise of the Islamic State]{.underline},
plans formed in the margins of the 2014 summit in Wales. Strategic
leadership, strategic depth, and strategic flexibility are [why
[NATO's]{.mark} [value is difficult to overstate]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It is a political-military arrangement that has proved remarkably
resilient over decades and has consistently demonstrated its value to
its members on both sides of the Atlantic. This is arguably why Vladimir
Putin's Russia is so intent on undermining it. The strategic conundrum
for the United States---and for its NATO allies---is therefore how to
keep intact the alliance system that serves as the bedrock for myriad
social, economic, and political benefits to its members in the face of
an aggressive adversary. [But defend its old and new allies alike the
United States must. Otherwise it risks losing a leadership position and
benefits that have become a central, if overlooked, aspect of [American
prosperity.]{.mark} In a very real way, the [security of NATO allies is
inextricably linked with American interests]{.mark}]{.underline}.

##### Republican win can affect Climate Change spending strategies

**Moran Stanley 5/24:** "How midterm elections can affect markets"
5/24/22. Morgan Stanley.
https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/midterm-elections-2022-equities-fixed-income_Albert

Investor complacency regarding U.S. midterm congressional elections is
understandable given that prediction markets are indicating a high
likelihood of Democrats losing control of at least one chamber.But
political pundits have been proven wrong before, and markets have a
history of misinterpreting policy impacts of election results. With tax,
healthcare and tech regulation among policy variables that could hinge
on the outcome, planning ahead---and leaving room for a scenario that
goes against the consensus---is especially important."While we\'re not
arguing that Democrats are likely to keep Congressional control, we do
think the consensus is likely too complacent, opening the door to
volatility in the pockets of the market that we\'ve flagged as sensitive
to election outcomes," says Michael Zezas, Head of U.S. Public Policy
Research and Municipal Strategy at Morgan Stanley Research. 

Signals to Watch Prediction markets---which are exchange-traded markets
for speculating on events---recently implied a 90% chance that
Republicans will win at least one chamber of Congress. Prediction
markets often are closely correlated with the final outcomes and
significant moves in the weeks immediately before the election and can
give investors a signal they may need to adjust.Likewise, a president's
disapproval rating, and in turn his party's midterm prospects, track
closely with inflation and generic ballots---which are polls that
indicate the political party voters plan to support---and have a solid
track record of predicting election results.Recently, both indicators
pointed to a Republican win of at least the House and a high chance of
winning the Senate too. Investors should watch these numbers in the
months ahead for potential signs of a different outcome than expected in
November. What the Possible Outcomes May Mean: To understand the
potential regulatory implications on sectors, including pharmaceuticals
and technology, as well on as issues such as China competition, taxes
and climate, Zezas and analysts across a dozen research disciplines
explored the plausible policy paths of three outcomes. Policy Path #1
Republicans Win Control of Both Houses Republicans need to gain four
seats to take the House. Meanwhile, a 50/50 Senate means they need to
net one seat to gain control. With such relatively low barriers to
victory, prediction markets recently implied a 74% probability that
Republicans would win both chambers and control of the legislative
agenda. Market Impact: This outcome would make major new spending
initiatives unlikely to materialize over the next two years, while
fiscal policy would remain reactive rather than proactive. "In this
scenario, certain legislative priorities are immediately off the
table--like tax increases or investments in clean energy--while others
become much more difficult to achieve," says Zezas. Moreover, if
Republicans won't have the ability to push their policy preferences past
the White House, investors should prepare for gridlock.

 

##### **Republicans Have Set the Stage to Legally Overturn Election Results they don't like; Biggest Threat to our Democracy Is GOP Overturning Election Results** 

**Levitsky and Ziblatt July 2021**

government at Harvard University. Daniel Ziblatt is the Eaton Professor
of the Science of Government at Harvard University. They are the authors

The Atlantic. July 9, 2021. LV

Unless and until the Republican Party recommits itself to playing by
democratic rules of the game, American democracy will remain at risk[.
**[The greatest threat to American democracy today is not a repeat of
January 6, but the possibility of a stolen]{.underline}**]{.mark}
presidential **[[election]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Contemporary
democracies that die meet their end at the ballot box, through measures
that are nominally constitutional. The looming danger is not that the
mob will return; it's that mainstream Republicans will "legally"
overturn an election. In 2018, when we wrote How Democracies Die, we
knew that Donald Trump was an authoritarian figure, and we held the
Republican Party responsible for abdicating its role as democratic
gatekeeper. But we did not consider the GOP to be an antidemocratic
party. Four years later, however, **[the bulk of the Republican Party is
behaving in an antidemocratic manner]{.underline}**. Solving this
problem requires that we address both the acute crisis and the
underlying long-term conditions that give rise to it. Addressing the
short-term threat Last year, for the first time in U.S. history, a
sitting president refused to accept defeat and attempted to overturn
election results. Rather than oppose this attempted coup[, leading
Republicans either cooperated with it or enabled it by refusing to
publicly acknowledge Trump's defeat. In the run-up to January 6, most
top GOP officials refused to denounce extremist groups that were
spreading conspiracy theories]{.underline}, calling for armed
insurrection and assassinations, and ultimately implicated in the
Capitol assault. [Few Republicans broke with Trump after his incitement
of the insurrection, and those who did were censured by their state
parties.]{.underline}. From November 2020 to January 2021, then, a
significant portion of the Republican Party refused to unambiguously
accept electoral defeat, eschew violence, or break with extremist
groups---the three principles that define prodemocracy parties. Because
of that behavior, as well as its behavior over the past six months, we
are convinced that **[[the Republican Party leadership is willing to
overturn an election]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Moreover, we are concerned
that it will be able to do so---legally. That's why we serve on the
board of advisers to Protect Democracy, a nonprofit working to prevent
democratic decline in the United States. We wrote this essay as part of
"The Democracy Endgame," the group's symposium on the long-term strategy
to fight authoritarianism. As we argued in How Democracies Die, our
constitutional system relies heavily on forbearance. Whether it is the
filibuster, funding the government, impeachment, or judicial
nominations, our system of checks and balances works best when
politicians on both sides of the aisle deploy their institutional
prerogatives with restraint. In other words, when they avoid applying
the letter of the law in ways contrary to the spirit of the law---what's
sometimes called constitutional hardball. When contemporary democracies
die, they usually do so via constitutional hardball. [Democracy's
primary assailants today are not generals or armed revolutionaries, but
rather politicians---Hugo Chávez, Vladimir Putin, Viktor Orbán, Recep
Tayyip Erdoğan---who eviscerate democracy's substance behind a carefully
crafted veneer of legality and constitutionality]{.underline}. This is
precisely what could happen in the next U.S. presidential race.
Elections require forbearance[. For elections to be democratic, all
adult citizens must be equally able to cast a ballot and have that vote
count. Using the letter of the law to violate the spirit of this
principle is strikingly easy. Election officials can legally throw out
large numbers of ballots on the basis of the most minor
technicalities]{.underline} (e.g., the oval on the ballot is not
entirely penciled in, or the mail-in ballot form contains a typo or
spelling mistake). Large-scale ballot disqualification accords with the
letter of the law, but it is inherently antidemocratic, for it denies
suffrage to many voters. Crucially[, if hardball criteria are applied
unevenly, such that many ballots are disqualified in one party's
stronghold but not in other areas, they can turn an election**[.
Republican officials across the country are laying the legal
infrastructure]{.mark}** to do just that. Since January, according to
Protect Democracy, Law Forward, and the States United Democracy Center,
Republicans have introduced 216 bills (in 41 states) aimed at
**[facilitating hardball electoral tactics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As of
June, 24 of these bills had passed, including in the battleground states
of Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and Texas. Approved measures **[allow
Republican-controlled state legislatures or election boards to sideline
or override local election administrations in Democratic strongholds.
This would allow state legislatures or their appointees to meddle in
local decision making, purge voter rolls, and manipulate the number and
location of polling places. It would also allow Republicans in Arizona,
Georgia, and elsewhere to do something Trump tried and failed to do in
2020: throw out ballots]{.underline}** in rival strongholds in order to
overturn a statewide result. Finally, the new laws impose criminal
penalties for local election officials deemed to violate election
procedure. [This will enable statewide Republican officials to compel
local officials, via threats of criminal prosecution, to engage in
electoral hardball. Throwing out thousands of ballots in rival
strongholds may be profoundly antidemocratic, but it is technically
legal, and Republicans in several states now have a powerful stick with
which to enforce such practices]{.underline}. Republican politicians
learned several things in the 2020 election's aftermath. First, Trump's
failed campaign to overturn the results revealed a variety of mechanisms
that may be exploited in future elections. Second, Republicans
discovered that their base would not punish them for attempting to steal
an election. To the contrary, they now know that efforts to overturn an
election will be rewarded by Republican voters, activists, local and
state parties, and many donors. The 2020 election was, in effect, a
dress rehearsal for what might lie ahead. All evidence suggests that if
the 2024 election is close, the **[Republicans will deploy
constitutional hardball to challenge or overturn the results in various
battleground states. Recent history and public-opinion polling tell us
that the Republican activist base will enthusiastically
support---indeed, demand---such tacti]{.underline}**cs. The new state
election laws will make that easier. Democratic strongholds in
Republican-led swing states will be especially vulnerable. And if
disputed state-level elections throw the election into the House of
Representatives, a Republican-led House would likely hand the presidency
to the Republican candidate (no matter who actually won the election).
The American system has faced crises before---including the disputed
elections in 1824, 1876, and 2000. Given the considerable authority that
the Constitution grants to state legislatures, the processes of voting,
vote counting, and even the selection of electors can easily be
subverted for partisan ends. Electoral guardrails must therefore be
hardened through federal legislation prior to the 2024 election. To save
democracy, democratize it Beyond the acute crisis facing American
democracy, however, is a deeper problem: the radicalization of the
Republican Party. **[[Unless and until the GOP recommits itself to
playing by democratic rules of the game, American democracy will remain
at risk. Each national election will feel like a national
emergency.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Therefore, the de-radicalization of
the Republican Party is a central task for the next decade. Normally, in
a two-party democracy, if one party veers off course, it is punished at
the ballot box. Electoral competition is thought to be a natural
corrective for political extremism: Parties that stray too far from the
average voter's positions lose votes, which compels them to moderate and
broaden their appeal to win again. When a professional sports team
loses, it fires its coach, acquires new players, and regroups. The same
should hold for political parties. Indeed, if you ask moderate or Never
Trump Republicans what will get Republicans back on course, they will
almost invariably answer "devastating electoral defeat." They may be
right. There is a hitch, however: Competition's effects are being
undermined in the U.S. today by what political scientists call
countermajoritarian institutions. We believe that [the U.S.
Constitution, in its current form, is enabling the radicalization of the
Republican Party and exacerbating America's democratic
crisis]{.underline}. The Constitution's key countermajoritarian
features, such as the Electoral College and the U.S. Senate, have long
been biased toward sparsely populated territories. But given that
Democrats are increasingly the party of densely populated areas and
Republicans dominate less populated areas, this long-standing rural bias
now allows the Republican Party to win the presidency, control Congress,
and pack the Supreme Court without winning electoral majorities.
Consider these facts: Republicans have won the popular vote for the
presidency only once since 1988, yet have governed the country for
nearly half of that period. The Democratic and Republican Parties each
control 50 seats in the U.S. Senate, even though Democratic senators
represent 40 million more voters than do Republican senators. The three
justices who most recently joined the Supreme Court were appointed by a
president who did not win the popular vote---and were confirmed by
Senate majorities that did not represent a majority of Americans.
Countermajoritarian institutions shield Republicans from genuine
competition[. By allowing Republicans to win power without national
majorities, this constitutional welfare allows the GOP to pursue
extremist strategies that threaten our democracy without suffering
devastating electoral consequences]{.underline}. Most Americans oppose
most of the Republicans' current positions. But if we do not reform our
democracy to allow majorities to speak, expecting the GOP to change
course would be naive. Americans tend to view countermajoritarian
institutions as essential to liberal democracy. And some of them are. In
the United States, the Bill of Rights and judicial review help ensure
that individual liberties and minority rights are protected. But many of
our countermajoritarian institutions are legacies of a pre-democratic
era. Where they pervade the electoral or legislative arenas, they do not
protect minority rights so much as empower partisan minorities and, in
some cases, enable minority rule. To save our democracy, we must
democratize it. **[[A political system that repeatedly allows a minority
party to control the most powerful offices in the country cannot remain
legitimate for long]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Following the example of
other democracies, we must expand access to the ballot, reform our
electoral system to ensure that majorities win elections, and weaken or
eliminate antiquated institutions such as the filibuster so that
majorities can actually govern. Congress is considering limited
democratizing reforms, such as banning legislative gerrymandering. But
those proposals pale in comparison with the extent of the problem.
Serious constitutional reform may seem like a daunting task, but
Americans have refounded our democracy before. After the Civil War and
during the Progressive era and the civil-rights movement, political
leaders, under pressure from organized citizens, remade our democracy.
Always unfinished, our Constitution requires continuous updating.
American democracy thrived because it allowed itself to be reformed.
Given the scale of the threat, reforming our democracy over the next
decade is among the most pressing challenges we face today.

West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin left his party in a climate bind, as
[[Democrats prepare to move ahead]{.mark} this week [on a budget
reconciliation bill]{.mark} without the clean energy provisions they
negotiated for nearly a year.]{.underline} President Joe Biden on Friday
called on Congress to pass a narrow bill that includes only an agreement
on drug pricing and Affordable Care Act subsidies after [[Manchin said
he would not vote on climate provisions]{.mark} and tax hikes this month
in the wake of another round of high inflation numbers. It would
effectively mean [meeting Manchin's requests and putting an end to
Democrats' effort to pass climate policy]{.mark} along party lines under
the Senate's reconciliation rules.]{.underline} Manchin said he was open
to finalizing a climate deal in September if next month's Consumer Price
Index numbers improve (Greenwire, July 15). But with the midterm
elections nearing --- and potential ACA premium increases next month
ahead of the midterms --- the prospect for legislating on climate change
in this Congress is all but dead. It's a stinging defeat for climate
activists and Democrats who watched the last major congressional effort
to legislate on climate change die in the Senate in 2010. ["**[He has
sabotaged the president's agenda]{.mark}**," Senate Budget Chair Bernie
Sanders (I-Vt.) said yesterday on ABC's "This Week."]{.underline} "The
problem was that we continued to talk to Manchin like he was serious. He
was not," Sanders said. "This is a guy who is a major recipient of
fossil fuel money, a guy who has received campaign contributions from 25
Republican billionaires." [[Democrats are left with few remaining
options]{.mark}. Some want to continue negotiating for a bigger
legislative deal in the next two months, and most are calling for more
robust executive action on climate from the Biden administration.
[Others are holding out slim hope]{.mark}s of simply [electing more
Democrats to pass a climate bill]{.mark} in the midterms.]{.underline}
"If the Senate will not move to tackle the climate crisis and strengthen
our domestic clean energy industry, I will take strong executive action
to meet this moment," Biden said in a statement last week (E&E News PM,
July 15). "My actions will create jobs, improve our energy security,
bolster domestic manufacturing and supply chains, protect us from oil
and gas price hikes in the future, and address climate change." It's not
entirely clear yet what that would entail. Biden has pledged to slash
U.S. emissions 50 to 52 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, and the
clean energy provisions under negotiation were seen a crucial policy to
get there. For now, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) is
preparing to move ahead with the narrow drug pricing deal this week,
POLITICO reported, sending it to the parliamentarian for review.
Negotiations on the bipartisan innovation and competition bill have
gotten tied up with reconciliation after Senate Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell (R-Ky.) threatened to kill it should Democrats move forward on
their social spending package. The Senate is set to move ahead with a
slimmed down version --- centered on \$52 billion for the semiconductor
industry --- this week, but it's unclear what the package might look
like[. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who is close to McConnell, tweeted
that the demise of the [Democrats' broad budget reconciliation effort
with climate spending]{.mark} and new taxes [would pave the way for
bipartisan action on innovation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Still, the
atmosphere on Capitol Hill remains tense. Many Democrats are bitterly
disappointed and distrustful of Manchin, who whittled away at their
climate policy options for months before sinking them entirely last
week. Progressives, in particular, viewed climate legislation as a key
selling point to younger voters ahead of the midterms. The failure to
pass broader climate and social spending policies "has already hurt
Democrats" on the campaign trail, Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair
Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) told reporters. "We're going to have to get
two more Democrats, real Democrats \[in the Senate\], who will actually
help us to implement the president's agenda, not obstruct it," Jayapal
told reporters. KEEP TALKING? Key House committee chairs, however, said
last week they would be willing to continue waiting it out until
September if it meant they could secure a broader deal. "If he's leaving
a gap in the door, then that's the way it is," said House Natural
Resources Chair Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.). Ways and Means Chair Richard
Neal (D-Mass.) similarly noted that House lawmakers have spent a lot of
political capital negotiating and working on a framework for a larger
deal over the last year. "I want to believe, for the purpose of getting
a big deal, that \[Manchin\] wants to act in good faith," Neal told
reporters. Despite the fact that talks have fallen apart multiple times
over the last year, "it's never a bad deal to try and reengage," said
House Budget Chair John Yarmuth (D-Ky.). "Do I think it would be
productive to do it? No. Do I think it would be advisable to do it?
Yeah, sure," Yarmuth told reporters. Many environmental groups have
essentially written Manchin off and even called for him to be removed as
chair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. But Tiernan
Sittenfeld, senior vice president for government affairs at the League
of Conservation Voters, said she's not giving up on a legislative deal
quite yet. "The Senate is not supposed to go out for August recess for
three weeks," Sittenfeld said Friday at a news conference on Capitol
Hill. ["That is [plenty of time for Sen. Manchin to come back to the
table today,]{.mark} [right now, and get this bill passed before they go
out on their August recess]{.mark}." [CALLS FOR EXECUTIVE ACTION Climate
rally]{.mark} and press conference. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) during
a press conference with lawmakers and environmental advocates on Capitol
Hill on Friday.]{.underline} \| Francis Chung/E&E News The focus for
many Democrats now is on the executive branch, where Biden still has
power to stiffen emissions regulations and halt new fossil fuel
projects. Top of the mind for progressives is declaring a climate
emergency. Many Democrats have called for Biden to do it for years now,
and now they see an obvious opening because Biden no longer has to walk
a delicate line to please Manchin. As Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) put
it, Biden should "open the full suite of emergency authorities to do big
things on the clean energy transition." It would offer the
administration authority to support lawsuits against the fossil fuel
industry and accelerate things like heat pump manufacturing and the
transition of the federal fleet to electric vehicles, Huffman said.
"We're not powerless, and I think it's important to make that
distinction," Huffman said. ["**[Nobody is surrendering here. Nobody is
putting up the white flag and saying, 'Joe Manchin wins]{.mark},'** but
it is time to change tactics." Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) offered
up a ten-point plan for executive action. It includes buffing up the
federal social cost of carbon, requiring all major emitters to install
carbon capture, using the bully pulpit to call out corporations who
obstruct climate action and limiting co-pollutants from fossil fuel
power plants. ["With legislative climate options now closed, it's now
time for executive Beast Mode,]{.mark}"]{.underline} Whitehouse tweeted
last week. Still, gas price politics remain a factor. The Biden
administration --- and many moderate Democrats --- are wary of the
optics of any move that could be seen as exacerbating high energy prices
with the midterms around the corner. The Manchin news last week, for
instance, came as Biden was in oil-rich Saudi Arabia, where the
president said he was "doing all I can to increase the supply for the
United States of America." And the reality is that executive action
would be fundamentally limited in scope without Congress pumping big
money into the deployment of new and existing clean energy technology.
"I'm not there yet. I think some stuff you have to do through
legislation," Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) said in an interview. "I
wouldn't want to suggest this is something you can't backfill with
executive action --- you can --- but this is something we will not have
the opportunity to do again." The Supreme Court also limited EPA's power
to regulate power plant greenhouse gas emissions in last month's West
Virginia v. EPA decision, another blow to the administration's efforts.
"It's clear that there needs to be swift progress on all fronts of
government if the US is going to get on track to achieving the target.
This means that Congress, the Biden administration, and states all need
to accelerate progress this year towards closing the emissions gap,"
researchers at the Rhodium Group wrote this month. "If any front fails
to act, it will be increasingly difficult to see a reasonable path to
the 2030 climate target." With current policy trajectories, the Rhodium
Group found the United States is on track to cut emissions 24 percent to
25 percent below 2005 levels in 2030. That's well under Biden's promise
under the Paris agreements to halve emissions by 2030. Grijalva
acknowledged the uncertain path forward. "I don't know," he told
reporters Friday when asked what executive action the administration
should take. "It's something you can't delay, and you can't hide it with
smoke and mirrors. Essentially, no action and the crisis gets worse."
WHAT HAPPENED? With little legislative recourse left, Democrats on
Capitol Hill have largely been left to fume at Manchin and unleash
months of pent-up frustration. And even if some want to hold out for the
broader deal, Manchin has repeatedly called for delays and slimmer
spending since Democrats began talking about a reconciliation bill last
year. In September of last year, the West Virginia Democrat called for a
"strategic pause" and said he would not support the original proposed
price tag of \$3.5 trillion. As negotiations continued, Manchin ruled
out the so-called Clean Electricity Performance Program --- once the
centerpiece of the bill's climate provisions --- and took issue with
electric vehicle incentives and the fee on methane emissions. He
eventually sunk the entire effort in December amid increasing inflation
fears. When Schumer and Manchin began talking again this year,
discussions centered around a much smaller package with some \$500
billion in spending and \$1 trillion in revenues. Adding to the [current
[Democratic frustration]{.mark} is the fact that [the pair were close to
a deal on the climate provisions]{.mark}, according to staffers familiar
with the negotiations and Democratic lawmakers. Manchin himself said
Friday that climate talks had been headed in a "very, very productive"
direction[. The House-passed version of the "Build Back Better Act"
contained \$555 billion in climate spending]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the
latest round of talks, Schumer had agreed to slash that to \$375 billion
to secure Manchin's support, according to a Democrat briefed on the
matter. That essentially left a suite of clean energy tax credits for a
host of wind, solar, energy storage, carbon capture and nuclear energy
technologies. Schumer had also agreed to nix direct pay options and
electric vehicle credit expansions --- two major Manchin sticking points
--- according to the Democrat. "Sen. Schumer will have to decide whether
he wants to continue this tease with Joe Manchin, but I think we should
stop empowering this guy to be his own branch of government," Huffman
said. ["[And if you care about climate in particular, it's time to just
accept that he's going to screw us every single time." Manchin]{.mark},
for his part, said he had simply told Schumer he supports much of the
clean energy package but could not move on it immediately while
inflation is at 9.1 percent.]{.underline} "He took that as 'no,' I
guess, and came out with this big thing last night. I don't know why
they did that, I guess to try to put pressure on me, but they've been
doing that for over a year now," Manchin told Hoppy Kercheval of West
Virginia MetroNews on Friday. However, since last year, Manchin has gone
from from supporting the climate portion of the reconciliation package
to questioning its price tag, its provisions and its very purpose.
Manchin has expressed concerns about the minerals needed for clean
energy and said the transition to renewables is already happening. But
Manchin's view, Schumer's move "doesn't make any sense at all."

#### Any Legislation Passed Now that is Not Core to Dem Base Saps Finite PC

**Olsen,** Henry. "As Biden reaches his 100-day mark, his approval
ratings suggest he's no FDR" [The Washington Post.]{.underline} Apr 26,
20**21.**

Many Democrats dream that President Biden can transform America as
thoroughly as Franklin D. Roosevelt did. But Biden\'s political standing
as he approaches his administration\'s 100-day mark has more in common
with Bill Clinton and Barack Obama than with the legendary FDR.
Roosevelt took office after winning a massive landslide at the depths of
the Great Depression. Backed by a nearly 200-seat majority in the House
and a 58-to-37 Senate majority, FDR pushed through law after law
designed to pull the country out of the economic doldrums. Growth and
confidence returned, and he and his party were rewarded with more
historic victories in the 1934 and 1936 elections. In just four years,
FDR had pulled America leftward and entrenched his party\'s dominance
for nearly 50 years. Compare this with the tenures of Clinton and Obama.
Both Democratic presidents won office with comfortable, but not
landslide, wins. Their parties also controlled the House and Senate with
comfortable, but not enormous, margins. Both men set to work reviving
the economy, Clinton from a mild recession and Obama from the 2008
financial collapse. Both succeeded in pushing through significant
stimulus measures by spring. But after that initial success, they
diverged from FDR\'s playbook. Each changed their focus from economic
recovery to pushing longtime Democratic priorities. They made health
reform the centerpieces of their presidencies and promoted other issues
(e.g., allowing gay people to serve in the military for Clinton,
addressing climate change for Obama) that were not priorities for the
swing voters who had empowered them and their party. The results were
dire for each: Record-setting Republican midterm victories stopped their
efforts to change America in their tracks**[. Biden and House Democrats
are pushing an even more aggressive agenda with smaller political
capital. Democrats hold a thin majority in the House]{.underline}**
**[and control a 50-50 Senate]{.underline}** only by virtue of Vice
President Harris\'s ability to break ties. Yet, Democrats under Biden,
after pushing through their covid-19 stimulus bill, are signaling
another lurch to the left. **[The House is busy passing bills that have
nothing to do with the crisis that got them elected]{.underline}**, such
as their election reform bill and D.C. statehood. **[Biden is proposing
more massive expansions of government power and spending that have more
to do with Democratic priorities than aiding post-pandemic
recovery]{.underline}**. Biden\'s job approval ratings also have much
more in common with his predecessors than with FDR. As of Friday
morning, Biden has a 52.7 percent approval rating on the
RealClearPolitics polling average. That\'s a lot higher than Donald
Trump\'s rating was at this point of his presidency, but it\'s lower
than every other one of Biden\'s predecessors since 1980 at this stage
of their presidencies except Clinton, whose approval rating at this
point was statistically identical to Biden\'s. Some of this is surely
due to the country\'s polarized politics, but it also reflects that
Biden might not be pulling new voters into his coalition. His 52.7
percent rating is only 1.4 percentage points higher than the 51.3
percent of the vote he received last November. That\'s the smallest
improvement over a president\'s prior share of the vote of any president
in decades, again with the exception of the terminally unpopular Trump.
History suggests the political outlook for Democrats is grim, should
they stay on this track. Clinton\'s job approval rating hovered around
the 50-percent mark until the summer of 1994, with one dramatic dip in
the summer of 1993. As the public focused on his priorities, however,
they started to sour on him. By mid-October, the Gallup poll gave him
only a 41 percent approval rating. Obama\'s approval rating also stayed
above 50 percent for a long time, dipping below it in May 2010. It
bottomed out at a higher level than Clinton\'s, about 46 percent, but
that still did not prevent Republicans from gaining 63 House seats and
the lion\'s share of gubernatorial and state legislative races. This
should be ringing Democratic alarm bells, but instead it seems to be
having the opposite effect**[. Biden is trying to do more
legislatively]{.underline}**, apparently on the theory that if enough
change happens fast enough, Republicans can\'t undo it even if they
tried**[. It\'s the political version of throwing everything on the wall
and seeing what sticks. Progressives might tell Biden to damn the
torpedoes and full speed ahead]{.underline}**. As captain of the
Democratic navy, Biden looks like he will take their advice. **[We\'ll
see if his moderate helmsmen among Senate Democrats are willing to go
down with the ship.]{.underline}**

### IMPACT SCENARIOS

#### [CIVIL WAR Election Chaos/Democratic Decline]{.underline}

##### The impact of a civil war outweighs all aff impact scenarios -- civil war is probable in this context, goes international and effects become widespread

As interstate war has become less common, academic attention has shifted
to the plethora of armed conflicts occurring within the boundaries of
states. These [civil wars have proven to be more protracted and
difficult to terminate for numerous reasons that vary according to their
unique socio-economic, political and cultural contexts.]{.underline}
Hence, providing a perfect general theory is problematic. Nevertheless,
a number of critical factors that affect the duration of civil wars and
their inability to be resolved relative to interstate wars can be
distinguished. Firstly, unlike interstate wars, which occur between
clearly-defined armies and are generally amenable to compromise**[,
[civil]{.mark} [wars]{.mark} [tend]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [be]{.mark}
low-intensity, [existential]{.mark} [struggles]{.mark}, [making]{.mark}
[them]{.mark}, therefore, [inherently]{.mark}-[protracted]{.mark}
[affairs]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover, the decentralized
organizational structure of contemporary insurgencies and their tendency
to fragment and become engulfed in internecine fighting further
undermines attempts at reaching a political settlement. Third[,
[peace]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [difficult]{.mark} to achieve [when]{.mark},
for many actors, [war]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [preferable]{.mark}. Often
ignored is the capacity of war to endow belligerents with profits and
power. Various cases of "enemies" colluding to prolong violence
challenge the common assumption that the ultimate objective of war is
victory.]{.underline} Finally, the essay questions what an "end" to
civil war implies. [[Even]{.mark} [when]{.mark} [one]{.mark}
[side]{.mark} [claims]{.mark} [total]{.mark} [victory]{.mark}
[or]{.mark} in the rare cases where [peace]{.mark} [accords]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} [signed]{.mark} and the war is formally concluded, the
[transition]{.mark} [from]{.mark} large-scale [civil]{.mark}
[violence]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [peace]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [not]{.mark} so
[clear]{.mark}.]{.underline} Collective memories of mutual violence
persist into the post-conflict period, and cultures of violence are
sustained. [If not fully addressed, along with the underlying grievances
that originally inspire violence, peace will remain at best fragile, and
violence may continue in other forms.]{.underline} In this light, even
the success stories of post-accord societies in Latin America and
Lebanon appear to be "unfinished" civil wars.\[1\] The Asymmetric Nature
of Civil Wars: Given that interstate wars are generally fought in a
series of direct confrontations between professional armies and across
defined frontlines, they are relatively quick and decisive. In contrast,
intrastate wars are distinguished by the asymmetric distribution of
material power among the main parties of the conflict, usually the
incumbent government or power and the rebels or insurgents opposing it[.
The asymmetric nature of internal conflicts forces insurgents to adopt a
strategy of guerrilla warfare in which the evasion of the enemy is a
matter of survival.]{.underline} To overcome its military weakness, the
insurgent force gradually wears down the enemy through hit-and-run
tactics. [Civil war is thus an inherently-protracted affair**. What adds
complexity to [these]{.mark} [wars]{.mark} is that they [are]{.mark}
[almost]{.mark} [never]{.mark} wholly [internal]{.mark}. [In]{.mark} an
[age]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [interconnectivity]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[interdependency]{.mark}, their [outcome]{.mark} [is]{.mark} often of
[strategic]{.mark} interest [not]{.mark} [only]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[neighboring]{.mark} [powers]{.mark} [but]{.mark} [also]{.mark} to the
[international]{.mark} [community]{.mark} at-large**]{.underline}. The
[role of external intervention in influencing the balance of power
between parties and therefore the trajectory of civil wars is
critical.]{.underline} When external intervention is balanced between
the opposing sides it can increase the duration of war.\[2\]
[[This]{.mark} [was]{.mark} [most]{.mark} [evident]{.mark} when the
[Cold]{.mark} [War]{.mark} superpowers played out their ideological
struggle in the conflict theater of the global South]{.underline}. The
weaponry and supplies they provided fueled some of the most ferocious
internal conflicts. Similarly, the internationalization of the
contemporary Syrian conflict seems to have reconfigured the balance of
power towards a prolonged stalemate.\[3\] Here, [negotiation may only be
contemplated when both parties reach a "mutually hurting
stalemate,]{.underline}"\[4\] that is, a stage of deadlock when both
sides simultaneously perceive continued fighting as offering little
returns and mounting costs. However, with external actors distorting the
perception of warring parties' prospects on the battlefield, arriving at
this stage may take many years. [Limited Space for Compromise Interstate
[wars]{.mark} may be [driven]{.mark} [by]{.mark} border disputes; they
could be a reaction to some [existential]{.mark} [threat]{.mark}, an
[attempt]{.mark} [at]{.mark} [regional]{.mark} [hegemony]{.mark},
[or]{.mark} a [contest]{.mark} for [access]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[trade]{.mark} [routes]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [resources]{.mark}, to name
a few]{.underline}. In theory, all of these factors are amenable to
compromise, even if they too can produce long and costly wars. The
Persian Gulf War is but one example; after eight years of conflict,
Saddam Hussein relinquished his demands for complete control over
Shatt-Al Arab and began withdrawing his forces from Iran, effectively
bringing the war to a close. Where civil wars are driven by limited aims
and objectives, the government can respond with the necessary reforms
and negotiate with the aggrieved parties to stifle the conflict**[.
[When]{.mark} the [objective]{.mark} [is]{.mark} to [secede]{.mark},
[to]{.mark} [overthrow]{.mark} the [government,]{.mark} [or]{.mark} even
to radically [transform]{.mark} [social]{.mark} [structures]{.mark},
[compromise]{.mark} is [improbable]{.mark} [if]{.mark} [not]{.mark}
[impossible]{.mark}. [Secession]{.mark} is [unfeasible]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} [there]{.mark} [can]{.mark} [only]{.mark} [be]{.mark}
[one]{.mark} [government]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Such]{.mark}
[wars]{.mark} [are]{.mark} [existential]{.mark} struggles with each side
framing the conflict in terms of "victory or death."]{.underline}
**[[Unsurprisingly]{.mark}, they [take]{.mark} an [intensely]{.mark}
[violent]{.mark} [nature]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Where belligerents
cannot envision a common future of power sharing, incumbents have
attempted to delegitimize their opponents by labeling them "terrorists,"
"criminals," or " foreign agents."]{.underline} [This
[de-politicization]{.mark} of the opposition is a common feature of
civil wars and [serves]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a [serious]{.mark}
[impediment]{.mark} [to]{.mark} their [termination]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} [civil]{.mark} [means]{.mark}. As long as insurgents
are excluded from the political arena, violent force will remain their
primary means of communication]{.underline}. In other cases, parties may
be willing to compromise on their original political goals and form a
united government[. However, the vulnerability of disarming and
demobilizing entails, given the absence of mutual trust and the lack of
a third party entity to monitor and enforce the agreement, can encourage
combatants to reject opportunities for a peace
settlement.]{.underline}\[5\] Here, it is the security dilemma, rather
than the limited scope of compromise that inhibits the resolution of
civil wars.\[6\] Organizational Structure: Fragmentation and Internal
Rivalry A central requirement for any effective peace settlement is the
presence of strong, representative leaders at the negotiating table.
Interstate wars meet this condition more easily[. Governments tend to
maintain a unified hierarchical structure, with a strategic apex that
exerts a tight reign over its security apparatus. In contrast,
contemporary insurgencies are decentralized coalitions, plagued by
factionalism and weak command and control.]{.underline}\[7\] Their
propensity for **[[fragmentation]{.mark} [is]{.mark} a [serious]{.mark}
[impediment]{.mark}]{.underline}** to their resolution, which only
becomes more potent as the war goes on and as new sub-groups emerge with
their own interests and agendas. [As the number of parties to a conflict
increases, the prospects for agreement shrink, and, consequently, the
duration of the internal war expands]{.underline}.\[8\] The contemporary
experience of Syria is telling. As the war enters its third year, the
broad coalition of groups constituting the armed opposition has grown to
include thousands of foreign fighters and Salafist groups such as Jabhat
al-Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant,
who all possess their own unique ideological vision of Syria's
future.\[9\] These increasingly potent groups, among other factions,
refuse to succumb to the influence and control of the Free Syrian Army
and its political wing, viewing the latter as an elite grouping of
self-interested exiles. **[The [detachment]{.mark} [between]{.mark} the
[political]{.mark} [wing]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [opposition]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} those on the [battleground]{.mark} is
[problematic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Any decision made on the
negotiating table at the national or international level is of limited
value without the consent of those who control the reality on the
ground. The Personalization of Civil Wars Though fragmentation can
prolong civil wars, strong leadership is not necessarily a
panacea.]{.underline} The Syrian civil war, like others, has also been
sustained by its deeply personalized nature. The reputation of Bashar Al
Assad among loyalists has achieved a "non-negotiable" status, while the
opposition has refused to accept anything short of his removal from
power. [Gaddafi and Milosevic are two examples of leaders who opted for
their own political survival over the national interest, manipulating
and inflaming existing social divisions to escalate the war and secure
their power]{.underline}.\[10\] Jonas Savimbi appeared to be the main
"spoiler" of the Bicesse peace accords, rejecting the outcome of 1992
presidential election and returning the country to a state of war.
Indeed, it was only with his death that his successor, Paulo Armindo
Lukamba returned UNITA to the negotiating table and large-scale violence
subdued.\[11\] General Michel Awn's sense of omnipotence drove him to
reject numerous invitations to join the post-Ta' if government, and
instead to declare a "war of liberation" against the Syrian military
presence that would claim more than a thousand lives.\[12\] Of course,
leaders are not always the all- powerful decision makers who the media
portrays, and placing too much emphasis on their character can lend to
their demonization. Nonetheless, the role of the individual cannot be
completely discredited either. Indeed, breakthroughs in peace
negotiations have frequently coincided with changes in the top
leadership.\[13\] A Political Economy Perspective[: Entrenched Interests
in the Continuation of Violence The amount of material destruction and
human suffering a civil war produces is immense]{.underline}. Yet, while
the majority of the population may seek its end, a minority can develop
an entrenched interest in its continuation. Thus[, attempts to explain
the [longevity]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [civil]{.mark} [wars]{.mark} are only
[complete]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [reference]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the
[political]{.mark} and [economic]{.mark} [incentives]{.mark}
[they]{.mark} [present]{.mark}. [As]{.mark} the [civil]{.mark}
[war]{.mark} [rages]{.mark} on, the [state's]{.mark} [capacity]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [control]{.mark} all its [territories]{.mark},
[enforce]{.mark} the [law]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [provide]{.mark} basic
[goods]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [services]{.mark} are
[eroded]{.mark}]{.underline}. A range of [informal actors, from
warlords, militias, and gangs, emerges to fill the vacuum, often carving
out their own enclaves where they can become the prime source of social
administration and coercion as well as the de-facto owners of the area
and its resources]{.underline}. In this context of the state
collapse**[, [ordinary]{.mark} [civilians]{.mark} can [become]{.mark}
willing [participants]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
[violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For young uneducated and unemployed
men and women, joining an armed band may be the only alternative to a
life of destitution. [Violence becomes a means of subsistence, supplying
its members with shelter and food as well as a sense of protection,
belonging and status in a society in which family networks and state
institutions have disintegrated.]{.underline}\[14\] State collapse does
not imply an inherent descent into anarchy and senseless violence.
Rather**[, an organized [war]{.mark} [economy]{.mark} [based]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} [looting]{.mark}, [extortion]{.mark}, and
[protection]{.mark} rackets [forms]{.mark} [around]{.mark} the
[armed]{.mark} [groups]{.mark}. [Militias]{.mark} originally
[relying]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [volunteers]{.mark} [to]{.mark} fill their
ranks and [finance]{.mark} their [operations]{.mark} mutate into
professional business entities [with]{.mark} profitable [links]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [regional]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [international]{.mark}
[trading]{.mark} [networks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This has been
particularly the case after the end of Cold War. With the sudden absence
of external patronage, the warring parties to many conflicts in the
South still had to look beyond their borders for alternative means of
financing their operations[. Therefore, [even]{.mark} [if]{.mark}
[economic]{.mark} [globalization]{.mark} may [not]{.mark} [cause]{.mark}
[civil]{.mark} [wars]{.mark}, for their [roots]{.mark} often
[lay]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [cultural]{.mark}, [historical]{.mark} and
[political]{.mark} [grievances]{.mark}, one cannot deny its role in
empowering violent sub-national actors by sustaining contemporary war
economies.]{.underline} \[15\] As sub-national actors develop their
taste for the status, power and profits violence accrues, they may show
small interest in capturing a weak state with no means of enforcing its
control over its territories and resources. In the current state of
conflict there is a sense of familiarity and economic security.
Meanwhile, peace represents uncertainty. For a negotiated peace is
ultimately based on promises of political and economic inclusion that
can easily be betrayed. A popular assumption is that the objective of
each of the warring parties is the total defeat of the enemy's
capability.\[16\] In reality[, the state of violent conflict can endow
criminal activities with a rare legitimacy, and therefore every effort
is made by belligerents to eschew decisive battles]{.underline}.\[17\]
Indeed, [governments may form informal alliances with their enemies to
exploit unarmed civilians and natural resources]{.underline}. In Sierra
Leone, the poor pay and training of government forces and their
affiliated irregulars encouraged them to prey on civilians rather than
engage in costly combat with the Revolutionary United Front.
Demonstrating this, elite figures in the Angolan administration and
security forces have been accused of selling weapons to UNITA on
multiple occasions.\[18\] Similarly, an authoritarian government may
deliberately prolong the civil war as a means of concentrating its power
and destroying all opposition. In the name of combating "terror" and
suppressing "rebels[," a [government]{.mark} may [declare]{.mark} a
[state]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [emergency]{.mark}; [introduce]{.mark}
[draconian]{.mark} [laws]{.mark} to limit the freedom of expression,
assembly, and association; and indefinitely delay
elections]{.underline}. The actions of the Algerian government's in its
contest with Islamist insurgents during the 1990s seem to follow this
logic. In the series of massacres of the mid and late 1990s, government
forces merely watched from a close distance as Islamist guerrillas
slaughtered and mutilated civilians for hours.\[19\] As the war
progressed, the population became alienated from the Islamist cause
while the government enjoyed an increase in its support. Only by
escalating and prolonging the war could Algeria's military regime
entrench its political power. Unfinished Civil Wars: Sustained Cultures
of Violence and the Legacy of Atrocities Even where these barriers to
negotiated settlement have been overcome and contesting forces have
engaged in dialogue and agreed to end all military confrontations, the
transition from war to peace has been less than clear. [In Nicaragua, El
Salvador, and Guatemala, the ideological violence of their protracted
civil wars seems to have been merely substituted with extreme levels of
criminal violence]{.underline}.\[20\] There are many explanations for
why "peace" can be difficult to distinguish from war. However[, in all
cases where the peace process has failed to address the roots of the
conflict and to challenge the political structures, social divisions and
economic inequalities that gave rise to insurgencies in the first place,
violence has been renewed]{.underline}. In the case of Nicaragua and
Guatemala, the continued economic marginalization of its youth and the
incomplete efforts to reintegrate ex-combatants into civilian life have
manifested in the plethora of criminal gangs that dominate urban and
increasingly rural areas and threaten the rule of law.\[21\] The same
failure to reintegrate demobilized fighters was a feature of the Dayton
and Abouja peace processes.\[22\] Post- Ta'if Lebanon's peace is at best
described as a fragile one. The incessant paralysis of state
institutions, which is to a large extent the product of the accords'
consociational formula, has allowed crime to fester and the country to
be consumed by political assassinations and kidnappings. More
problematically, it has led citizens to increasingly rely on their own
sects for economic and social security.\[23\] Consequently, the
relationship between the various confessional groups in Lebanon is still
dominated by a degree of distance, suspicion, and even animosity.
Problematically, these social divisions have proven to be easily
inflamed by regional developments and external forces as well as local
elites.\[24\] It follows that Post-Ta'if Lebanon is more accurately
conceptualized as a prolonged ceasefire, rather than as a consolidated
peace as virtually the same socio-economic and political structures that
gave rise to the civil war remain intact. In such an environment the
threat of renewed large-scale violence is omnipresent. Critical to
understanding the fragility of post-conflict societies peace are the
legacies of atrocities, which remain unaddressed. While the populations
of warring states are separated and secured by their respective borders,
civil wars do not offer such sanctuary. **[By their nature,
[civil]{.mark} [wars]{.mark} occur among and between the people and,
therefore, [claim]{.mark} [large]{.mark} [number]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[civilian]{.mark} casualties]{.underline}**. With the objective of
controlling the populace, [factions resort to coercive and brutal means.
**When [so]{.mark} [many]{.mark} [civilians]{.mark} are
[displaced]{.mark}, [brutalized]{.mark} and [killed]{.mark}, a once
unified [society]{.mark} [becomes]{.mark} a [deeply]{.mark}
[polarized]{.mark} one**]{.underline}. [[Healing]{.mark} the
[psychological]{.mark} [wounds]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a [protracted]{.mark}
[civil]{.mark} [war]{.mark} to avoid its renewal proves to be a
[long]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [challenging]{.mark} process]{.underline}.
The [[consolidation]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [peace]{.mark} is
[further]{.mark} [endangered]{.mark} [by]{.mark} the [culture]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [violence]{.mark} that protracted civil wars can breed and
sustain, and [which]{.mark} often [persists]{.mark} [into]{.mark} the
[post]{.mark}-[war]{.mark} [period]{.mark}]{.underline}. During the
civil war, the barrel of the gun becomes the main means of resolving
disputes, making demands, and attaining perceived rights among large
swaths of the population[. The intensity of battle]{.underline} and the
level of atrocities against civilians can [erode the social norms that
may have regulated the use of violence in the past]{.underline}. In the
post-civil war environment, often characterized by a weak security
apparatus and criminal justice system, the widespread availability of
weapons and weak civil society, and with the collective memories of
atrocities still fresh, every incentive is available for an individual
to distribute his or her own retributive justice. When violence is not
sanctioned and barely condemned it becomes normalized and legitimated.
Conclusion This essay has attempted to present a number of structural
explanations for the protracted and persistent nature of civil wars
relative to interstate conflicts**[. At the most fundamental level,
civil wars' protracted nature stems from the material asymmetry between
the incumbent and the insurgents, their tendency to become
internationalized, and the limited space of compromise they
involve]{.underline}**. The essay has also highlighted the role of their
factionalized as well as personalized nature as barriers to a negotiated
settlement. Given the immense physical destruction protracted civil wars
entail, they are often reduced to irrational and meaningless conflicts.
However, such views disregard the economic and political incentives that
the continuation of violence presents to both sub-state actors and the
state itself. The structural aspects of intrastate conflict present
clear barriers to a negotiated settlement, but even in the cases where
it has been reached, it has rarely succeeded in putting a decisive end
to the war. As long as the root causes of civil war: insecurity,
poverty, overpopulation, political exclusion as well as the legacy of
atrocities and cultures of violence, are not addressed, violence
continues, even if it mutates into different forms and occurs between
different parties.

SECTION 1: IS DEMOCRACY FAILING? We examine this question along two key
dimensions: public opinion and institutional performance. THE AMERICAN
PUBLIC Based on six high-quality surveys conducted in the last year and
a half, support for democracy as the best form of government remains
overwhelming and mostly stable across party lines.\[3\] However, about 1
in 5 Americans have views that make them at least open to, if not
outright supportive of, authoritarianism.\[4\] But there's an important
qualification: Americans distinguish sharply between democracy in
principle and in practice. There is near-universal agreement that our
system is not working well---in particular, that it is not delivering
the results people want. This is troubling because most people value
democracy for its fruits, not just its roots.\[5\] Given that situation,
it is not surprising that public support is very high for fundamental
change in our political system to make the system work better. There is
no party of the status quo in contemporary America: both sides want
changes, but they disagree about the direction of change. Unfortunately,
about 6 in 10 Americans do not think that the system can change.\[6\]
And because it has not changed despite growing dysfunction, polarization
has led to legislative gridlock, which has generated rising support for
unfettered executive action to carry out the people's will. - Center for
Effective Public Management Senior Fellow - Governance Studies
**[[Democracy means the rule of the people, but Americans do not fully
agree about who belongs to the people]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although
there are areas of agreement across partisan and ideological lines, some
in our nation hold that to be "truly" American, you must believe in God,
identify as Christian, and be born in the United States.\[7\] **[[In a
period of increasing]{.underline}]{.mark}** immigration and religious
**[[pluralism, these divisions can become
dangerous.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Disagreements about who is truly
American are part of a broader cleavage in American
culture]{.underline}. 70% of Republicans believe that America's culture
and way of life have changed for the worse since the 1950s, while 63% of
Democrats believe that they have changed for the better.\[8\] Strong
majorities of Republicans agree that "Things have changed so much that I
often feel like a stranger in my own county," that "Today, America is in
danger of losing its culture and identity," and that "the American way
of life needs to be protected for foreign influences." Majorities of
Democrats reject these propositions. [Support for political violence is
significant. In February 2021, 39% of Republicans, 31% of Independents,
and 17% of Democrats agreed that "if elected leaders will not protect
America, the people must do it themselves, even if it requires violent
actions]{.underline}." In November, 30% of Republicans, 17% of
Independents, and 11% of Democrats agreed that they might have to resort
to violence in order to save our country."\[9\] While public support for
many of the reforms in federal compromise legislation is strong, there
is a divide in the electorate on what they view as the largest problem
in our current system.\[10\] In September, only 36% believed that "rules
that make it too difficult for eligible citizens to vote" constituted
the largest problem for our elections, compared to 45% who identified
"rules that are not strict enough to prevent illegal votes from being
cast" as the largest problem. The conclusion we draw from this quick
review of public opinion is that **[[if democracy fails in
America]{.underline}]{.mark}**, it will not be because a majority of
Americans is demanding a non-democratic form of government**[[. It will
be because an organized, purposeful minority seizes strategic positions
within the system and subverts the substance of democracy while
retaining its shell]{.underline}]{.mark}**---while the majority isn't
well organized, or doesn't care enough, to resist. As we show in a later
section, the possibility that this will occur is far from remote.
AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS A second way of considering whether democracy is
failing is to look at the institutions of government. Successful
democratic systems are not designed for governments composed of ethical
men and women who are only interested in the public good. If leaders
were always virtuous there would be no need for checks and balances. The
Founding Fathers understood this. They designed a system to protect
minority points of view, to protect us from leaders inclined to lie,
cheat and steal, and (paradoxically) to protect the majority against
minorities who are determined to subvert the constitutional order.
During the Trump presidency, the formal institutional "guardrails" of
democracy---Congress, the federalist system, the Courts, the
bureaucracy, and the press---held firm against enormous pressure. At the
same time, there is evidence that the informal norms of conduct that
shape the operation of these institutions have weakened significantly,
making them more vulnerable to future efforts to subvert them.\[11\]
[There is no guarantee that our constitutional democracy will survive
another sustained---and likely better-organized---assault in the years
to come]{.underline}. We begin with the good news about our
institutions. Former President Trump did not succeed in materially
weakening the powers of the Congress.\[12\] He did not try to disband
Congress, and while he often fought that institution, it fought back.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) had no trouble confronting him,
and Democrats brought impeachment charges against him not once but
twice. Although speculation was rampant, in the end then-Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell (R-KY) did not block either trial. While former Leader
McConnell and allies have been called former President Trump's lapdogs,
on virtually all domestic policy issues they have acted like almost any
Republican majority would act, and on foreign policy former Leader
McConnell neither stopped nor punished Republican senators who tried to
constrain Trump when they thought he was wrong.\[13\] The American
system is a federalist system. The Constitution distributes power
between the federal government and the state government, codified in the
10th Amendment to the Constitution. States have repeatedly and
successfully exercised their power against former President Trump,
especially in two areas, COVID-19 and voting.\[14\] Despite Mr. Trump's
attempts to pressure the nation's governors and other state officials
into doing what he wanted, he did not inflict lasting damage on the
federalist system, and the states are no weaker---perhaps even
stronger---than they were before his presidency. Citizens now understand
that in a crisis, states are the ones who control things that are
important to them like shutdown orders and vaccine distribution.
DEMOCRACY In the spring of 2020 then-President Trump, anxious to get
past COVID in time for his re-election campaign, was pushing hard for
states to open up early. Only a few complied, while many---including
some Republican governors---ignored him. Seeing that the governors were
not scared of him, Mr. Trump then threatened to withhold medical
equipment based on states' decisions about opening up. He came up
against the Supreme Court's interpretation of the 10th Amendment, which
prevents the president from conditioning federal aid on the basis of
governors' acquiescing to a president's demands.\[15\] **[[The
guardrails between the federal government and the states also held when
it came to Mr. Trump's campaign to reverse the 2020 election
results]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In Georgia, the Republican Secretary of
State Brad Raffensperger, a stalwart Republican and Trump supporter,
certified election results in spite of personal calls and threats from
the president. In Michigan, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mike
Shirkey and Republican House Speaker Lee Chatfield did not give in to
Trump's attempts to get them to diverge from the process of choosing
electors. One of the hallmarks of failing democracies is a weak judicial
system under heavy political control. But under assault from
then-President Trump, the judiciary remained independent despite his
repeated attempts to win in the courts what he could not win at the
ballot box. President Trump-appointed judges often made decisions that
thwarted Mr. Trump's attempts to overturn the results. In fact, after
the election Mr. Trump's team and allies brought 62 lawsuits and won
exactly one.\[16\] (The others he either dropped or lost.) Many of those
decisions were handed down by Republican judges.\[17\] Perhaps former
President Trump's biggest disappointment was the Supreme Court's
decision not to hear election challenges concerning states he claimed he
had won.\[18\] A free press is an essential element of a healthy
democracy. Former President Trump spent four years using the bully
pulpit of the presidency to mock the press, calling them names and "the
enemy of the people" and referring to outlets he does not like as
"failing." He revoked the press credentials of reporters he did not
like. (The courts restored them.) Nevertheless, reporters were not
afraid to call out his lies. With Mr. Trump out of office for months
now, no major news outlets have gone broke. Few are afraid to criticize
former President Trump or his supporters. **[[The free press is still
fundamentally free]{.underline}]{.mark}** (although President Trump
undoubtably contributed to some decline in public trust of the media,
which in turn weakens its oversight and accountability functions). Its
financial and structural problems, most of which are attributable to the
challenges of internet age, predated Mr. Trump. Some argue that former
President Trump increased distrust in the media but, as polling
indicates, the lack of trust in media declined to less than fifty
percent in the first decade of the 21st century and has stayed in the
low forties in recent years.\[19\] One final point: democracies often
fail when their military sides with anti-democratic insurgents. But
**[in the United States, the tradition of civil control over the armed
forces remains strong]{.underline}**---especially within the military.
After the chaos in Lafayette Park last June, when Mark Milley, the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared with then-President
Trump in military fatigues, Mr. Milley and other top military leaders
went out of their way to reaffirm this tradition, which is drilled into
all officers throughout their careers. [A military coup is the least
likely way for democracy in America to end.\[]{.underline}20\] SO WHY
ARE WE WORRIED? Although scholars and pundits have long chronicled with
regret the rise of partisan polarization and the decline of
congressional effectiveness**[[, concern about the outright failure of
American democracy was rare before the rise of Donald Trump. Never
before in American history have we had a candidate, not to mention a
president, who disparaged the integrity of the electoral
system]{.underline}]{.mark}** and who hinted repeatedly during his
election that he would not accept the results of the election if he
lost. This behavior began during the Republican primaries and continued
in advance of the 2016 election, which he won, and the 2020 election,
which he lost.\[21\] It built to a crescendo that exploded on January 6,
2021, when supporters, called to Washington for a "Stop the Steal"
rally, marched to the Capitol, attacked law enforcement officers,
vandalized offices, and breached the Senate gallery where the electoral
college vote was supposed to be taking place. The non-stop attacks on
American elections were part of a broader attack on the truth. Any story
Mr. Trump and his supporters disliked became "fake news," creating,
slowly but surely, an alternate universe that encompassed everything
from the integrity of the election to public health guidelines for the
COVID pandemic. The very existence of a sizeable number of citizens who
cannot agree on facts is an enormous threat to democracy. As the Yale
historian Timothy Snyder points out in his 2018 book, The Road to
Unfreedom, authoritarians like Vladimir Putin have no use for truth or
for the facts, because they use and disseminate only what will help them
achieve and maintain power.\[22\] As our colleague Jonathan Rauch argues
in The Constitution of Knowledge, disinformation and the war on reality
have reached "epistemic" proportions.\[23**[[\] Even though
constitutional processes prevailed and Mr. Trump is no longer president,
he and his followers continue to weaken American democracy by convincing
many Americans to distrust the results of the
election]{.underline}]{.mark}**. About three-quarters of rank-and-file
Republicans believe that there was massive fraud in 2020 and Joe Biden
was not legitimately elected president. "A 'Politico'/Morning Consult
survey found that more than one-third of American voters feel the 2020
election should be overturned, including three out of five
Republicans."\[24\] The aftermath of the 2020 election revealed
structural weaknesses in the institutions designed to safeguard the
integrity of the electoral process. A focus of concern is the Electoral
Count Act of 1887, which was adopted in response to the contested
election of 1876. This legislation is so ambiguously drafted that one of
former President Trump's lawyers used it as the basis of a memorandum
arguing that former Vice President Pence, whom the Constitution
designates as the chair of the meeting at which the Electoral College
ballots are counted, had the right to ignore certified slates of
electors the states had sent to Washington. If Mr. Pence had yielded to
then-President Trump's pressure to act in this manner, the election
would have been thrown into chaos and the Constitution placed in
jeopardy.\[25\] Recently, former President Trump's assault on the
integrity of the 2020 election has taken a new and dangerous turn.
Rather than focusing on federal government, his supporters have focused
on the obscure world of election machinery. Republican majorities in
state legislatures are passing laws making it harder to vote and
weakening the ability of election officials to do their jobs. In many
states, especially closely contested ones such as Arizona and Georgia,
Mr. Trump's supporters are trying to defeat incumbents who upheld the
integrity of the election and replace them with the former President's
supporters.\[26\] At the local level, death threats are being made
against Democratic and Republican election administrators, with up to
30% of election officials surveyed saying they are concerned for their
safety.\[27\] As seasoned election administrators retire or just quit,
Mr. Trump supporters are vying for these obscure but pivotal positions.
In Michigan, for instance, the Washington Post reports that there is
intense focus on the boards charged with certifying the vote at the
county level. Republicans who voted against former President Trump's
efforts to alter the vote count are being replaced. And most dangerous
of all, some states are considering laws that would bypass the
long-established institutions for certifying the vote-count and give
partisan legislatures the authority to determine which slate of electors
will represent them in the Electoral College**[[. American democracy is
thus under assault from the ground up. The]{.underline}]{.mark}** most
recent systematic attack on state and local election machinery is much
more dangerous than the chaotic statements of a disorganized former
president. A movement that relied on Mr. Trump's organizational skills
would pose no threat to constitutional institutions. A movement inspired
by him with a clear objective and a detailed plan to achieve it would be
another matter altogether. **[[The chances that this threat will
materialize over the next few years are high and
rising.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The evidence suggests that Mr. Trump is
preparing once again to seek the Republican presidential
nomination---and that he will win the nomination if he tries for it.
Even if he decides not to do so, the party's base will insist on a
nominee who shares the former president's outlook and is willing to
participate in a plan to win the presidency by **[[subverting the
results of state elections if necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The
consequences could include an extended period of political and social
instability, and an outbreak of mass violence.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

##### Democracy is on the brink of destruction, Trump dictatorship is within reach 

**DeVega 6-23**, CHAUNCEY,  politics writer for Salon, host of The
Chauncey DeVega Show, CHUD hunter, expert on TrumpWorld, Is American
democracy already lost? Half of us think so --- but the future remains

the American people understand that their **democracy and** their
**society are in deep trouble**. But they do not agree on who or what is
the cause of the problem, and do not share a common understanding of
basic facts. To make matters worse there is a kind of sinister synergy
between America\'s democracy crisis and other serious problems facing
the country, which risks creating a state of collective paralysis.
During his prepared comments before the House Jan. 6 committee last
Thursday, retired judge J. Michael Luttig, a lifelong conservative
Republican who advised former Vice President Mike Pence before and
during Donald Trump\'s coup attempt, issued this dire warning: A stake
was driven through the heart of American democracy on Jan. 6, 2021, and
our democracy today is on a knife\'s edge. America was at war on that
fateful day, but not against a foreign power. She was at war against
herself. We Americans were at war with each other --- over our
democracy. Jan. 6 was but the next, foreseeable battle in a war that had
been raging in America for years, though that day was the most
consequential battle of that war even to date. In fact, Jan. 6 was a
separate war unto itself, a war for America\'s democracy, a war
irresponsibly instigated and prosecuted by the former president, his
political party allies, and his supporters. Both wars are raging to this
day. ... America is now the stake in these unholy wars. ... America is
adrift. We pray that it is only for this fleeting moment that she has
lost her way, until we Americans can once again come to our senses.
Advertisement: In response to a question from committee chairman Bennie
Thompson about the danger to the republic still represented by Trump and
his supporters, Luttig elaborated further: Almost two years after that
fateful day ... Donald Trump and his allies and supporters are a clear
and present danger to American democracy. That\'s not because of what
happened on Jan. 6. It is because, to this very day, the former
president and his allies and supporters pledge that in the presidential
election of 2024, if the former president or his anointed successor as
the Republican party presidential candidate were to lose that election,
they would attempt to overturn that 2024 election in the same way that
they attempted to overturn the 2020 election, but succeed in 2024 where
they failed in 2020. Advertisement: Background Image Progress Bar 00:19

who continue to doubt that this country is in the midst of an
existential crisis, facing the dangers of Trumpism and a growing white
supremacist authoritarian movement, Luttig\'s words should shock them
back into reality. A new Yahoo News/YouGov poll adds even more weight to
Luttig\'s warnings about American democracy as it teeters on the
precipice of irrecoverable disaster. The lead finding is that more than
half of those surveyed, across the political spectrum --- 55% of
Democrats and 53% of Republicans --- believe it is \"likely\" that the
United States will \"cease to be a democracy in the future.\" RELATED:

that \"there will be a civil war in the United States in \[their\]

were willing to rule out using violence or \"taking up arms against the
government\" to protect the country from \"radical extremists,\" 26%
percent of those who participated said that political violence could
sometimes be justified. This new poll also demonstrates that negative
partisanship and other forms of extreme political polarization now
appear to be permanent features of American political life. Andrew
Romano summarizes this at Yahoo News: When asked to choose the phrase
that best \"describes most people on the other side of the political
aisle from you,\" a majority of Republicans pick extreme negatives such
as \"out of touch with reality\" (30%), a \"threat to America\" (25%),
\"immoral\" (8%) and a \"threat to me personally\" (4%). A tiny fraction
select more sympathetic phrases such as \"well-meaning\" (4%) or \"not
that different from me\" (6%). The results among Democrats are nearly
identical, with negatives such as \"out of touch with reality\" (27%), a
\"threat to America\" (23%), \"immoral\" (7%) and a \"threat to me
personally\" (4%) vastly outnumbering positives such as \"well-meaning\"
(7%) or \"not that different from me\" (5%). Advertisement: These
findings offer further evidence that the U.S. in the Age of Trump and
beyond is what political scientists call an \"anocracy,\" a system that
combines features of dictatorship and democracy. The coup against
democracy and the rule of law did not end when Trump\'s insurrectionists
left the Capitol on Jan. 6. The Republican-fascists and the larger white
right continue to advance a strategy whose ultimate goal is a Christian
fascist plutocracy, one modeled on a system of competitive
authoritarianism in which political parties still exist and elections
occur, but where outcomes are manipulated as in Russia, Hungary or
Turkey. Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to

political violence against their \"enemies,\" meaning liberals and
progressives, nonwhite people, Muslims, immigrants, LGBTQ people and any
other groups or individuals they deem insufficiently \"American\" and
not part of the MAGA faithful. The Republican Party, its propaganda
machine and other opinion leaders continue to amplify Trump\'s Big Lie
and its inherent conclusion that further violence may be necessary to
return Trump (or a successor) to the White House --- and, more
generally, to prevent Democrats from winning or holding power by any
means necessary. The core tenets of the \"great replacement\" conspiracy
theory --- which a white supremacist terrorist recently claimed as the
motive for murdering 10 Black people last month at a Buffalo supermarket
--- have been embraced by a majority of Republicans, and an even larger
majority of Trump followers. Advertisement: National security experts on
terrorism and armed conflict have continued to warn that Trump\'s coup
attempt and the Capitol attack are further evidence that the U.S. may
face a period of sustained right-wing violent insurgency. Robert Pape,
director of the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats,
has estimated that more than 20 million Americans believe that using
political violence to return Trump to power is justified. In a widely
read December 2021 essay in the Globe and Mail, Canadian political
scientist Thomas Homer-Dixon offered a memorably grim prognosis of
America\'s future. He predicted that \"**American democracy could
collapse\" by 2025** --- that is, following the next presidential
election --- and that by 2030, the U.S. \"could be governed by a
right-wing dictatorship\": We mustn\'t dismiss these possibilities just
because they seem ludicrous or too horrible to imagine. In 2014, the
suggestion that Donald Trump would become president would also have
struck nearly everyone as absurd. But today we live in a world where the
absurd regularly becomes real and the horrible commonplace.... Mr.
Trump\'s electoral loss has energized the Republican base and further
radicalized young party members. Even without their concerted efforts to
torque the machinery of the electoral system, Republicans will probably
take control of both the House of Representatives and Senate this coming
November, because the incumbent party generally fares poorly in mid-term
elections. Republicans could easily score a massive victory, with voters
ground down by the pandemic, angry about inflation, and tired of
President Joe Biden bumbling from one crisis to another. Voters who
identify as Independents are already migrating toward Republican
candidates. Once Republicans control Congress, Democrats will lose
control of the national political agenda, giving Mr. Trump a clear shot
at recapturing the presidency in 2024. And once in office, he will have
only two objectives: vindication and vengeance. Advertisement:
Homer-Dixon then drew the this parallel between the current state of the
U.S. and the collapse of the Weimar Republic in the early 1930s: The
situation in Germany in the 1920s and early 1930s was of course sui
generis; in particular, the country had experienced staggering traumas
--- defeat in war, internal revolution and hyperinflation --- while the
country\'s commitment to liberal democracy was weakly rooted in its
culture. But as I read a history of the doomed republic this past
summer, I tallied no fewer than five unnerving parallels with the
current U.S. situation. **America\'s future stability is so much in
doubt** that even global rivals or enemies are concerned about the
destructive forces unleashed by the Age of Trump. In a series of phone
calls before and after the 2020 election, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sought to reassure his Chinese counterpart,
saying, \"The American government is stable and everything is going to
be OK. \... Everything\'s fine. But democracy can be sloppy sometimes.\"
Advertisement: An ambush is always disorienting, and intentionally so,
but the best option is always to fight back. That\'s where we are right
now. This situation is undeniably bewildering, and deliberately so. But
for pro-democracy Americans, inaction is not an option. That will
inevitably lead to defeat. In military terms, a successful ambush is
almost always disorienting, but the best option is always to fight back,
not hunker down. The Republican-fascists and their allies want the
American people to feel so confused and overwhelmed by their unending
attack on democracy, the rule of law, the common good and basic human
decency that they essentially turn away, close their eyes and surrender.
In essence, the Republican-fascist movement is using their own version
of a political \"shock and awe\" strategy here at home against the
American people. Advertisement: The Lincoln Project recently offered
this evaluation of America\'s democracy crisis: After three \[Jan. 6
committee\] hearings we know for certain the nation is at one of the
most dangerous moments in its history. These revelations will not change
the true MAGA believers mind but will cause them to double and triple
down on the \"Big Lie\" --- making them more dangerous and perhaps more
violent. Every single American needs to decide if they are the side of
the seditionists who tried to tear down a free and fair election, or do
they support our Republic and its democratic principles? In short, the
American people must act with deliberate purpose and speed if they hope
to save their democracy and society. Voting is of course necessary, but
by itself is insufficient. \"Hashtag activism,\" with its \"likes\" and
\"shares\" and memes, is for the most part symbolic or performative
politics that accomplishes little or nothing in the long run, and may
actually be counterproductive if people mistake it for real action. In
the long-term struggle, substantive movement-building and organizing
will be required to defeat fascism in America and around the world.

democracy must engage in grassroots organizing. They need to join,
establish, and grow a range of civil society organizations. They must
raise and donate money in effective ways, not by giving it to doomed
Democratic candidates in hopeless races. Ultimately, they must be
willing to engage in corporeal politics, including general strikes,
street protests, civil disobedience and other forms of direct action
where they can confront the Republican-fascists and their allies with
overwhelming numbers. Advertisement: Right now, almost all the momentum
is with the Republican-fascists and their broad-spectrum attack on
American democracy and society. They are in revolutionary mode, and they

personal inventory and ask themselves, **\"How much am I willing to
sacrifice to save my country, my family and future generations from this
nightmare?\"** The future of American democracy and society largely
hinges on how many of us can answer that question honorably and rise to
the challenge. 

##### The impact of a civil war outweighs all aff impact scenarios -- civil war is probable in this context, goes international and effects become widespread

As interstate war has become less common, academic attention has shifted
to the plethora of armed conflicts occurring within the boundaries of
states. These [civil wars have proven to be more protracted and
difficult to terminate for numerous reasons that vary according to their
unique socio-economic, political and cultural contexts.]{.underline}
Hence, providing a perfect general theory is problematic. Nevertheless,
a number of critical factors that affect the duration of civil wars and
their inability to be resolved relative to interstate wars can be
distinguished. Firstly, unlike interstate wars, which occur between
clearly-defined armies and are generally amenable to compromise**[,
[civil]{.mark} [wars]{.mark} [tend]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [be]{.mark}
low-intensity, [existential]{.mark} [struggles]{.mark}, [making]{.mark}
[them]{.mark}, therefore, [inherently]{.mark}-[protracted]{.mark}
[affairs]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover, the decentralized
organizational structure of contemporary insurgencies and their tendency
to fragment and become engulfed in internecine fighting further
undermines attempts at reaching a political settlement. Third[,
[peace]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [difficult]{.mark} to achieve [when]{.mark},
for many actors, [war]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [preferable]{.mark}. Often
ignored is the capacity of war to endow belligerents with profits and
power. Various cases of "enemies" colluding to prolong violence
challenge the common assumption that the ultimate objective of war is
victory.]{.underline} Finally, the essay questions what an "end" to
civil war implies. [[Even]{.mark} [when]{.mark} [one]{.mark}
[side]{.mark} [claims]{.mark} [total]{.mark} [victory]{.mark}
[or]{.mark} in the rare cases where [peace]{.mark} [accords]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} [signed]{.mark} and the war is formally concluded, the
[transition]{.mark} [from]{.mark} large-scale [civil]{.mark}
[violence]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [peace]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [not]{.mark} so
[clear]{.mark}.]{.underline} Collective memories of mutual violence
persist into the post-conflict period, and cultures of violence are
sustained. [If not fully addressed, along with the underlying grievances
that originally inspire violence, peace will remain at best fragile, and
violence may continue in other forms.]{.underline} In this light, even
the success stories of post-accord societies in Latin America and
Lebanon appear to be "unfinished" civil wars.\[1\] The Asymmetric Nature
of Civil Wars: Given that interstate wars are generally fought in a
series of direct confrontations between professional armies and across
defined frontlines, they are relatively quick and decisive. In contrast,
intrastate wars are distinguished by the asymmetric distribution of
material power among the main parties of the conflict, usually the
incumbent government or power and the rebels or insurgents opposing it[.
The asymmetric nature of internal conflicts forces insurgents to adopt a
strategy of guerrilla warfare in which the evasion of the enemy is a
matter of survival.]{.underline} To overcome its military weakness, the
insurgent force gradually wears down the enemy through hit-and-run
tactics. [Civil war is thus an inherently-protracted affair**. What adds
complexity to [these]{.mark} [wars]{.mark} is that they [are]{.mark}
[almost]{.mark} [never]{.mark} wholly [internal]{.mark}. [In]{.mark} an
[age]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [interconnectivity]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[interdependency]{.mark}, their [outcome]{.mark} [is]{.mark} often of
[strategic]{.mark} interest [not]{.mark} [only]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[neighboring]{.mark} [powers]{.mark} [but]{.mark} [also]{.mark} to the
[international]{.mark} [community]{.mark} at-large**]{.underline}. The
[role of external intervention in influencing the balance of power
between parties and therefore the trajectory of civil wars is
critical.]{.underline} When external intervention is balanced between
the opposing sides it can increase the duration of war.\[2\]
[[This]{.mark} [was]{.mark} [most]{.mark} [evident]{.mark} when the
[Cold]{.mark} [War]{.mark} superpowers played out their ideological
struggle in the conflict theater of the global South]{.underline}. The
weaponry and supplies they provided fueled some of the most ferocious
internal conflicts. Similarly, the internationalization of the
contemporary Syrian conflict seems to have reconfigured the balance of
power towards a prolonged stalemate.\[3\] Here, [negotiation may only be
contemplated when both parties reach a "mutually hurting
stalemate,]{.underline}"\[4\] that is, a stage of deadlock when both
sides simultaneously perceive continued fighting as offering little
returns and mounting costs. However, with external actors distorting the
perception of warring parties' prospects on the battlefield, arriving at
this stage may take many years. [Limited Space for Compromise Interstate
[wars]{.mark} may be [driven]{.mark} [by]{.mark} border disputes; they
could be a reaction to some [existential]{.mark} [threat]{.mark}, an
[attempt]{.mark} [at]{.mark} [regional]{.mark} [hegemony]{.mark},
[or]{.mark} a [contest]{.mark} for [access]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[trade]{.mark} [routes]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [resources]{.mark}, to name
a few]{.underline}. In theory, all of these factors are amenable to
compromise, even if they too can produce long and costly wars. The
Persian Gulf War is but one example; after eight years of conflict,
Saddam Hussein relinquished his demands for complete control over
Shatt-Al Arab and began withdrawing his forces from Iran, effectively
bringing the war to a close. Where civil wars are driven by limited aims
and objectives, the government can respond with the necessary reforms
and negotiate with the aggrieved parties to stifle the conflict**[.
[When]{.mark} the [objective]{.mark} [is]{.mark} to [secede]{.mark},
[to]{.mark} [overthrow]{.mark} the [government,]{.mark} [or]{.mark} even
to radically [transform]{.mark} [social]{.mark} [structures]{.mark},
[compromise]{.mark} is [improbable]{.mark} [if]{.mark} [not]{.mark}
[impossible]{.mark}. [Secession]{.mark} is [unfeasible]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} [there]{.mark} [can]{.mark} [only]{.mark} [be]{.mark}
[one]{.mark} [government]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Such]{.mark}
[wars]{.mark} [are]{.mark} [existential]{.mark} struggles with each side
framing the conflict in terms of "victory or death."]{.underline}
**[[Unsurprisingly]{.mark}, they [take]{.mark} an [intensely]{.mark}
[violent]{.mark} [nature]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Where belligerents
cannot envision a common future of power sharing, incumbents have
attempted to delegitimize their opponents by labeling them "terrorists,"
"criminals," or " foreign agents."]{.underline} [This
[de-politicization]{.mark} of the opposition is a common feature of
civil wars and [serves]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a [serious]{.mark}
[impediment]{.mark} [to]{.mark} their [termination]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} [civil]{.mark} [means]{.mark}. As long as insurgents
are excluded from the political arena, violent force will remain their
primary means of communication]{.underline}. In other cases, parties may
be willing to compromise on their original political goals and form a
united government[. However, the vulnerability of disarming and
demobilizing entails, given the absence of mutual trust and the lack of
a third party entity to monitor and enforce the agreement, can encourage
combatants to reject opportunities for a peace
settlement.]{.underline}\[5\] Here, it is the security dilemma, rather
than the limited scope of compromise that inhibits the resolution of
civil wars.\[6\] Organizational Structure: Fragmentation and Internal
Rivalry A central requirement for any effective peace settlement is the
presence of strong, representative leaders at the negotiating table.
Interstate wars meet this condition more easily[. Governments tend to
maintain a unified hierarchical structure, with a strategic apex that
exerts a tight reign over its security apparatus. In contrast,
contemporary insurgencies are decentralized coalitions, plagued by
factionalism and weak command and control.]{.underline}\[7\] Their
propensity for **[[fragmentation]{.mark} [is]{.mark} a [serious]{.mark}
[impediment]{.mark}]{.underline}** to their resolution, which only
becomes more potent as the war goes on and as new sub-groups emerge with
their own interests and agendas. [As the number of parties to a conflict
increases, the prospects for agreement shrink, and, consequently, the
duration of the internal war expands]{.underline}.\[8\] The contemporary
experience of Syria is telling. As the war enters its third year, the
broad coalition of groups constituting the armed opposition has grown to
include thousands of foreign fighters and Salafist groups such as Jabhat
al-Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant,
who all possess their own unique ideological vision of Syria's
future.\[9\] These increasingly potent groups, among other factions,
refuse to succumb to the influence and control of the Free Syrian Army
and its political wing, viewing the latter as an elite grouping of
self-interested exiles. **[The [detachment]{.mark} [between]{.mark} the
[political]{.mark} [wing]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [opposition]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} those on the [battleground]{.mark} is
[problematic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Any decision made on the
negotiating table at the national or international level is of limited
value without the consent of those who control the reality on the
ground. The Personalization of Civil Wars Though fragmentation can
prolong civil wars, strong leadership is not necessarily a
panacea.]{.underline} The Syrian civil war, like others, has also been
sustained by its deeply personalized nature. The reputation of Bashar Al
Assad among loyalists has achieved a "non-negotiable" status, while the
opposition has refused to accept anything short of his removal from
power. [Gaddafi and Milosevic are two examples of leaders who opted for
their own political survival over the national interest, manipulating
and inflaming existing social divisions to escalate the war and secure
their power]{.underline}.\[10\] Jonas Savimbi appeared to be the main
"spoiler" of the Bicesse peace accords, rejecting the outcome of 1992
presidential election and returning the country to a state of war.
Indeed, it was only with his death that his successor, Paulo Armindo
Lukamba returned UNITA to the negotiating table and large-scale violence
subdued.\[11\] General Michel Awn's sense of omnipotence drove him to
reject numerous invitations to join the post-Ta' if government, and
instead to declare a "war of liberation" against the Syrian military
presence that would claim more than a thousand lives.\[12\] Of course,
leaders are not always the all- powerful decision makers who the media
portrays, and placing too much emphasis on their character can lend to
their demonization. Nonetheless, the role of the individual cannot be
completely discredited either. Indeed, breakthroughs in peace
negotiations have frequently coincided with changes in the top
leadership.\[13\] A Political Economy Perspective[: Entrenched Interests
in the Continuation of Violence The amount of material destruction and
human suffering a civil war produces is immense]{.underline}. Yet, while
the majority of the population may seek its end, a minority can develop
an entrenched interest in its continuation. Thus[, attempts to explain
the [longevity]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [civil]{.mark} [wars]{.mark} are only
[complete]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [reference]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the
[political]{.mark} and [economic]{.mark} [incentives]{.mark}
[they]{.mark} [present]{.mark}. [As]{.mark} the [civil]{.mark}
[war]{.mark} [rages]{.mark} on, the [state's]{.mark} [capacity]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [control]{.mark} all its [territories]{.mark},
[enforce]{.mark} the [law]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [provide]{.mark} basic
[goods]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [services]{.mark} are
[eroded]{.mark}]{.underline}. A range of [informal actors, from
warlords, militias, and gangs, emerges to fill the vacuum, often carving
out their own enclaves where they can become the prime source of social
administration and coercion as well as the de-facto owners of the area
and its resources]{.underline}. In this context of the state
collapse**[, [ordinary]{.mark} [civilians]{.mark} can [become]{.mark}
willing [participants]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
[violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For young uneducated and unemployed
men and women, joining an armed band may be the only alternative to a
life of destitution. [Violence becomes a means of subsistence, supplying
its members with shelter and food as well as a sense of protection,
belonging and status in a society in which family networks and state
institutions have disintegrated.]{.underline}\[14\] State collapse does
not imply an inherent descent into anarchy and senseless violence.
Rather**[, an organized [war]{.mark} [economy]{.mark} [based]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} [looting]{.mark}, [extortion]{.mark}, and
[protection]{.mark} rackets [forms]{.mark} [around]{.mark} the
[armed]{.mark} [groups]{.mark}. [Militias]{.mark} originally
[relying]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [volunteers]{.mark} [to]{.mark} fill their
ranks and [finance]{.mark} their [operations]{.mark} mutate into
professional business entities [with]{.mark} profitable [links]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [regional]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [international]{.mark}
[trading]{.mark} [networks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This has been
particularly the case after the end of Cold War. With the sudden absence
of external patronage, the warring parties to many conflicts in the
South still had to look beyond their borders for alternative means of
financing their operations[. Therefore, [even]{.mark} [if]{.mark}
[economic]{.mark} [globalization]{.mark} may [not]{.mark} [cause]{.mark}
[civil]{.mark} [wars]{.mark}, for their [roots]{.mark} often
[lay]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [cultural]{.mark}, [historical]{.mark} and
[political]{.mark} [grievances]{.mark}, one cannot deny its role in
empowering violent sub-national actors by sustaining contemporary war
economies.]{.underline} \[15\] As sub-national actors develop their
taste for the status, power and profits violence accrues, they may show
small interest in capturing a weak state with no means of enforcing its
control over its territories and resources. In the current state of
conflict there is a sense of familiarity and economic security.
Meanwhile, peace represents uncertainty. For a negotiated peace is
ultimately based on promises of political and economic inclusion that
can easily be betrayed. A popular assumption is that the objective of
each of the warring parties is the total defeat of the enemy's
capability.\[16\] In reality[, the state of violent conflict can endow
criminal activities with a rare legitimacy, and therefore every effort
is made by belligerents to eschew decisive battles]{.underline}.\[17\]
Indeed, [governments may form informal alliances with their enemies to
exploit unarmed civilians and natural resources]{.underline}. In Sierra
Leone, the poor pay and training of government forces and their
affiliated irregulars encouraged them to prey on civilians rather than
engage in costly combat with the Revolutionary United Front.
Demonstrating this, elite figures in the Angolan administration and
security forces have been accused of selling weapons to UNITA on
multiple occasions.\[18\] Similarly, an authoritarian government may
deliberately prolong the civil war as a means of concentrating its power
and destroying all opposition. In the name of combating "terror" and
suppressing "rebels[," a [government]{.mark} may [declare]{.mark} a
[state]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [emergency]{.mark}; [introduce]{.mark}
[draconian]{.mark} [laws]{.mark} to limit the freedom of expression,
assembly, and association; and indefinitely delay
elections]{.underline}. The actions of the Algerian government's in its
contest with Islamist insurgents during the 1990s seem to follow this
logic. In the series of massacres of the mid and late 1990s, government
forces merely watched from a close distance as Islamist guerrillas
slaughtered and mutilated civilians for hours.\[19\] As the war
progressed, the population became alienated from the Islamist cause
while the government enjoyed an increase in its support. Only by
escalating and prolonging the war could Algeria's military regime
entrench its political power. Unfinished Civil Wars: Sustained Cultures
of Violence and the Legacy of Atrocities Even where these barriers to
negotiated settlement have been overcome and contesting forces have
engaged in dialogue and agreed to end all military confrontations, the
transition from war to peace has been less than clear. [In Nicaragua, El
Salvador, and Guatemala, the ideological violence of their protracted
civil wars seems to have been merely substituted with extreme levels of
criminal violence]{.underline}.\[20\] There are many explanations for
why "peace" can be difficult to distinguish from war. However[, in all
cases where the peace process has failed to address the roots of the
conflict and to challenge the political structures, social divisions and
economic inequalities that gave rise to insurgencies in the first place,
violence has been renewed]{.underline}. In the case of Nicaragua and
Guatemala, the continued economic marginalization of its youth and the
incomplete efforts to reintegrate ex-combatants into civilian life have
manifested in the plethora of criminal gangs that dominate urban and
increasingly rural areas and threaten the rule of law.\[21\] The same
failure to reintegrate demobilized fighters was a feature of the Dayton
and Abouja peace processes.\[22\] Post- Ta'if Lebanon's peace is at best
described as a fragile one. The incessant paralysis of state
institutions, which is to a large extent the product of the accords'
consociational formula, has allowed crime to fester and the country to
be consumed by political assassinations and kidnappings. More
problematically, it has led citizens to increasingly rely on their own
sects for economic and social security.\[23\] Consequently, the
relationship between the various confessional groups in Lebanon is still
dominated by a degree of distance, suspicion, and even animosity.
Problematically, these social divisions have proven to be easily
inflamed by regional developments and external forces as well as local
elites.\[24\] It follows that Post-Ta'if Lebanon is more accurately
conceptualized as a prolonged ceasefire, rather than as a consolidated
peace as virtually the same socio-economic and political structures that
gave rise to the civil war remain intact. In such an environment the
threat of renewed large-scale violence is omnipresent. Critical to
understanding the fragility of post-conflict societies peace are the
legacies of atrocities, which remain unaddressed. While the populations
of warring states are separated and secured by their respective borders,
civil wars do not offer such sanctuary. **[By their nature,
[civil]{.mark} [wars]{.mark} occur among and between the people and,
therefore, [claim]{.mark} [large]{.mark} [number]{.mark} [of]{.mark}

**When [so]{.mark} [many]{.mark} [civilians]{.mark} are
[displaced]{.mark}, [brutalized]{.mark} and [killed]{.mark}, a once

[psychological]{.mark} [wounds]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a [protracted]{.mark}
[civil]{.mark} [war]{.mark} to avoid its renewal proves to be a

The [[consolidation]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [peace]{.mark} is

sustain, and [which]{.mark} often [persists]{.mark} [into]{.mark} the
[post]{.mark}-[war]{.mark} [period]{.mark}]{.underline}. During the
civil war, the barrel of the gun becomes the main means of resolving
disputes, making demands, and attaining perceived rights among large
swaths of the population[. The intensity of battle]{.underline} and the
level of atrocities against civilians can [erode the social norms that
may have regulated the use of violence in the past]{.underline}. In the
post-civil war environment, often characterized by a weak security
apparatus and criminal justice system, the widespread availability of
weapons and weak civil society, and with the collective memories of
atrocities still fresh, every incentive is available for an individual
to distribute his or her own retributive justice. When violence is not
sanctioned and barely condemned it becomes normalized and legitimated.
Conclusion This essay has attempted to present a number of structural
explanations for the protracted and persistent nature of civil wars
relative to interstate conflicts**[. At the most fundamental level,
civil wars' protracted nature stems from the material asymmetry between
the incumbent and the insurgents, their tendency to become
internationalized, and the limited space of compromise they
involve]{.underline}**. The essay has also highlighted the role of their
factionalized as well as personalized nature as barriers to a negotiated
settlement. Given the immense physical destruction protracted civil wars
entail, they are often reduced to irrational and meaningless conflicts.
However, such views disregard the economic and political incentives that
the continuation of violence presents to both sub-state actors and the
state itself. The structural aspects of intrastate conflict present
clear barriers to a negotiated settlement, but even in the cases where
it has been reached, it has rarely succeeded in putting a decisive end
to the war. As long as the root causes of civil war: insecurity,
poverty, overpopulation, political exclusion as well as the legacy of
atrocities and cultures of violence, are not addressed, violence
continues, even if it mutates into different forms and occurs between
different parties.

#### [CLIMATE-Failure to Pass Climate Legislation ASAP Catastrophic]{.underline} 

###### Failure to Keep Control Of Congress Jeopordizes Climate Legislation that Will Avert Climate Catastrophe 

**Grandoni et al. 7/16.** Dino Grandoni, Brady Dennis and Juliet
Eilperin "Democrats push sweeping climate legislation amid a scorching
summer The Senate budget plan, which would compel power plants to slash
emissions and impose a tax on laggard nations, still faces major
hurdles" [The Washington Post]{.underline}.
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/07/16/climate-deal-democrats/>
July 16, 2022. LV

While the \$3.5 trillion budget deal that emerged Wednesday could change
in key ways in the months ahead, the proposal represents **[[one of the
biggest efforts yet that Congress has undertaken to address climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It underscores how cutting U.S.
greenhouse gas emissions --- **[[and spurring other nations to do the
same --- has emerged as a central priority for President Biden and his
party]{.underline}]{.mark}** after years of relative indifference from
lawmakers in Washington**[. "We are facing a planetary crisis, not in
the future or somewhere far away, but in every community across the
country]{.underline}**," said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who along
with several other Senate Democrats has said he won't support more
traditional infrastructure spending without a separate bill that
includes meaningful climate action. "So what we do has to be bold enough
to meet the moment." **[Still, the climate measures unveiled this week
face significant political, legal and technical hurdles
---]{.underline}** including some from within the Democratic Party
itself. Already, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), a crucial vote
Democrats will need to pass any legislation opposed by Republicans, has
expressed skepticism over the push to rapidly phase out fossil fuels.
**[[The package represents the best chance of locking in the emissions
cuts required to meet Biden's goal of cutting U.S. greenhouse gas
emissions at least in half by 2030, compared to 2005
levels]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer
(D-N.Y.) and other Democrats have assembled policies that would help
realize that goal, while nudging the rest of the world to do the same[.
A central element in the plan would allow the United States to impose a
tax on nations lagging in reducing their own pollution, as well as a fee
on emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas more potent than carbon
dioxide in the short term.]{.underline} Domestically[, Democrats also
want to institute a new set of requirements --- called a
clean-electricity standard]{.underline} --- on power providers to shift
them toward wind, solar, hydroelectric, nuclear and other cleaner forms
of energy generation, with the goal of achieving 80 percent clean
electricity by the end of the decade. The package would also offer a
slew of tax breaks for buying electric vehicles and producing clean
energy, and would create a Civilian Climate Corps, modeled after
Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal-era Civilian Conservation Corps, which
would enlist young Americans in planting trees, hardening coasts against
rising tides and otherwise preparing the country for changing
conditions. The details of the budgetary package will be fleshed out in
the coming months, and it remains an open question as to whether the
cuts in emissions that would result --- both here and abroad --- would
be enough to help meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which
calls for keeping warming "well below" 2 degrees Celsius, compared to
preindustrial levels. By packing the climate provisions into a budget
measure, Schumer is aiming to avoid a Republican filibuster and pass the
bill through budget reconciliation, which requires a simple majority of
51 votes. But [Democrats hold the narrowest of margins in the Senate,
and Schumer probably will need to rally the support of every member of
his caucus to pass the legislation]{.underline}. He and other Democrats
know the clock is ticking, in more ways than one. **[[Passing
far-reaching climate measures, much less the litany of other
infrastructure-related priorities, will become only more difficult as
the midterm election year approaches and Democrats risk losing the
House, Senate or both]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In addition, environmental
advocates have kept up pressure on Biden to make good on promises to
combat climate change. The youth-led Sunrise Movement, for example, said
the House needs to go even bigger than the Senate proposal to fund
climate-friendly policies. "This is the first time since 2009 that
Democrats have control of both chambers of Congress and the White
House," Lauren Maunus, the group's advocacy director, said in a
statement. "They cannot afford to waste this opportunity." For many
Democrats, nature has been displaying another form of urgency in the
kind of startling and deadly events that scientists say are made more
frequent and intense by the Earth's warming. [A series of brutal heat
waves has roasted the Pacific Northwest and western Canada in recent
weeks, setting temperature records, fueling intense wildfires and
causing hundreds of deaths.]{.underline} A Canadian town burned. [Once
unthinkable triple-digit temperatures baked landscapes, contributing to
what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration called the
hottest June on record for the United States.]{.underline} Meanwhile,
crippling floods swept through Belgium and Germany this week, killing
dozens of people and sweeping away cars and buildings. The catastrophe
came amid a stretch of extreme weather in parts of Europe, including
unusually heavy rains. All that may just be a prelude of what's to come.
**[[Climate scientists say the United States and the rest of the world
have less than a decade to get greenhouse gas emissions under control,
or countries can expect ever more calamitous consequences from
warming]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Paul Bledsoe, a former Senate Finance
Committee staffer and Clinton White House climate adviser, noted that
the climate elements of this week's budget proposal are in line with
policies Biden promised to pursue during his presidential campaign. "He
ran on it," Bledsoe said of the border tariff proposal in particular.
"He characterized it in his campaign climate plan as a way to curb
China\'s emissions, specifically." As to whether it will ever become a
reality, that could take months or even years to fully play out. Even if
the United States passed such an emissions-based tariff similar to that
proposed this week by the European Union, the ultimate question is
whether such measures would survive scrutiny by the World Trade
Organization. European Commission proposes ambitious climate change
policies, urging U.S. and other nations to follow "In my view, at this
stage, the carbon tariff is more important as a political mechanism
rather than in policy terms," Bledsoe said. "It sends a global message
that the U.S. does intend to eventually pursue carbon border taxes. It
also sends a message to Republican critics who claim we are not forcing
other nations to reduce their emissions, especially China." Danny
Richter, vice president of government affairs at the Citizens' Climate
Lobby, said the United States may ultimately need to place a price on
carbon for domestic producers if it wants to tariff carbon pollution
abroad without running afoul of global trade rules. "They want to keep
it even-steven between countries," Richter said of the WTO. The proposal
from Senate Democrats also comes as the European Commission this week
unveiled its own ambitious blueprint to tackle climate change, with a
goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55 percent in coming years,
compared to 1990 levels. The swath of proposals announced Wednesday in
Europe included its own carbon border tariff mechanism, as well as
potentially phasing out new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. They also
include dozens of other measures, from ramping up support for renewable
energy to planting billions of trees. On this side of the Atlantic, the
push for a clean-energy standard that would shift the nation closer to
Biden's goal of carbon-free electricity by 2035 could prove a tough sell
for more conservative Democrats. "That jumps out at me as the most
vulnerable," said Bledsoe. Not only will a clean-energy standard
probably need the support of every Senate Democrat, it also will require
a favorable ruling from the Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth
MacDonough, to be included in a budget bill --- a tall order given her
rejection of a minimum-wage increase, another Democratic priority, in a
pandemic relief measure. Some parliamentary experts caution that because
the primary aim of the policy is not related to federal revenue, it is
likely to be ruled out. Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a longtime
advocate of more ambitious climate action, said Democrats have no choice
but to try however possible to pass legislation that tackles a looming
global problem. ["This is the most significant moment for climate action
in years,"]{.underline} Markey said in a statement Thursday. "We've got
work to do in order to get these programs right, but I'm confident we
will construct a final bill that has justice and equity, creates jobs,
and reduces emissions in a meaningful way." One major hurdle is Manchin,
chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and a
conservative Democrat from the coal- and gas-producing state of West
Virginia who has already expressed concern to other Democrats about
moving too quickly. "I told them that I was concerned about some of the
language I've seen that moves away from fossil \[fuels\]," Manchin told
reporters Wednesday, without going into specifics. One coal state
senator holds the key to Biden's ambitious climate agenda. And it's not
McConnell. On the other side of the Capitol, Rep. Raúl Grijalva
(D-Ariz.), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said the
Senate budget proposal "makes significant down payments," but he
ultimately wants to see even more funding to combat climate change. "I
will say we were hoping for more, but we're dealing with the Senate," he
said. Some Republican opponents made clear they want less, not more. In
a statement Thursday, Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.), the ranking Republican
on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, criticized the
border tax proposal and said the Democratic version of a clean-energy
standard "would be disastrously expensive and harmful to U.S.
competitiveness." "Instead of mandating expensive energy and starting a
global green trade war," Barrasso said, "we need to focus on finding
ways to use all of our nation's energy sources and make them cleaner and
more affordable." If Congress fails to pass requirements for power
plants to cut greenhouse gas emissions, it will fall to the
Environmental Protection Agency to write climate rules on its own. But
doing so has proved in the past to be difficult. The Supreme Court
blocked the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan from ever taking
effect. With former president Donald Trump having appointed three
justices, the high court has only become more conservative since that
2016 ruling. Bob Perciasepe, a senior adviser at the Center for Climate
and Energy Solutions and former deputy EPA administrator under Barack
Obama, said existing law is "not well done when it comes to trying to
deal with something like greenhouse gases and different kinds of power
plants all over the place." Despite the uncertainties ahead for
Biden-era climate proposals, Schatz said he remains optimistic. "We are
determined, hopeful and unified," he said. "That doesn't mean there
won't be multiple near-death experiences for this effort --- there
always is --- but we are in a position to succeed. And we must." Mike
DeBonis and Jeff Stein contributed to this report.

##### [NATO GOOD]{.underline}

###### NATO is one of the best bargains in geopolitics -- working with NATO benefits Americans

McInnis 6/28 \[6/28/2022\] Kathleen J. McInnis, a senior fellow in the
International Security Program\
and the director of the Smart Women, Smart Power Initiative at the
Center for Strategic and\
International Studies.
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/28/us-nato-alliance-madrid/ AD

worth risking New York to save Vilnius or Warsaw, capitals of faraway
countries separated from the United States by a wide ocean? [The answer
lies in the way [NATO]{.mark} [has]{.mark} worked, as [amply
demonstrated in practice, for the simultaneous advancement of both
American and European interests.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Although the U.S. security guarantee for its NATO allies has been at the
heart of the alliance's political-military framework, and the United
States has spent considerable sums on the maintenance of defense
capabilities as a result, this has never been a one-way bargain. These
treaty relationships have afforded the United States a position of
strategic leadership. [[As a result of]{.mark} America's central role in
trans-Atlantic and international relations that [NATO]{.mark} cemented,
[Americans have enjoyed enormous economic prosperity and
freedom.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Put more bluntly: Successive American governments have been afforded
privileged status when it has come to issues including trade
partnerships and access to bases in large part because of the outsized
role that the United States plays in the defense of its allies. Nor
would the United States have been able to sustain its significant
portfolio of foreign military sales and defense technology cooperation
activities without the strategic foundation laid by its role as NATO's
primary security guarantor for seven decades.

This position of leadership---manifested in its overseas presence---also
allows the United States to set the international security agenda in
both political and practical ways. America would not have been able to,
for example, prosecute expeditionary and counterterrorism operations in
the Middle East and Africa were it not for the bases and pre-positioned
equipment that the United States has been able to maintain on allied
soil in Europe.

Coalition operations to stabilize the Balkans or conduct anti-piracy
missions off the Horn of Africa would not be as comparatively
straightforward (or maybe even possible) without the decades of
interoperability standardization agreements, multinational training
exercises, or the International Military Staff through which allies can
collectively plan for and integrate their military operations. NATO's
structures also afford U.S. military leaders direct experience of the
complexities of commanding multilateral military operations.

Another long-standing reason for U.S. engagement in the European theater
is to enable U.S. strategic depth. Labeled "defense in depth" by
security practitioners, military technological developments and
adversary operations during the world wars demonstrated that the United
States was no longer protected by the two oceans off of its shores. As a
result, it was deemed strategically prudent to station U.S. forces
overseas in order to be able to contend with adversary aggression---if
not outright conflict---far away from the American homeland.

Not only did this make the American homeland less vulnerable to outright
war, but forward presence was also viewed as relatively
cost-effective---especially given the potentially enormous social,
political, and economic costs of a war on the American continent. The
advent of the nuclear age changed that calculation
somewhat---intercontinental ballistic missiles made the American
homeland vulnerable---but given that even a nuclear war with the Soviet
Union would also likely involve combined arms combat in the European
theater, the logic of defense in depth held.

Over the decades, that rationale has endured even as the strategic
context changed. For example, a primary reason for U.S. counterterrorism
operations in the Middle East after the 9/11 attacks was to tackle the
root sources of violent extremist groups before they could again build
sufficient capability and capacity to conduct terrorist attacks against
the U.S. homeland. The war in Ukraine, along with the attendant concerns
about the security and defense on the European continent that are now
heightened, once again underscore the importance---and relative
cost-effectiveness---of forward military presence. Moreover, the global
political significance of the United States' track record when it comes
to maintaining these alliances over the long haul can arguably give the
United States another kind of depth: credibility.

While the United States' reliability as a security partner is frequently
called into question in response to day-to-day events, taking a step
back it is quite remarkable that U.S. commitments to its allies in
Europe have weathered any number of geopolitical storms. The daily
management of alliance relationships is a complicated business, of
course. But in constructing and recalibrating security relationships
with other states, including critical ties in Asia, the U.S. record of
building and maintaining a long-standing alliance helps build
credibility with others.

More broadly, NATO affords its members an extraordinary---and
extraordinarily important---degree of strategic flexibility. NATO has
proved capable of reinvention, as its post-Cold War experience showed.
From the late 1990s until approximately 2014---and largely as a result
of U.S. prompting---NATO was primarily focused on collective security
and crisis management in Europe's near abroad and the Middle East.
Security interests were framed in terms of promoting global stability
and prosperity---including through countering and dismantling terrorist
groups outside NATO allied borders. In other words, contrary to
expectations in the early 1990s, NATO endured and evolved to contend
with myriad security challenges absent an overwhelming threat. And, by
the way, against this backdrop, U.S.-European trade remained strong.

In 2014, as Russia annexed Crimea and began waging a proxy war in
Ukraine, old adversarial geopolitics came rushing back. NATO's role as a
bulwark against an expansionist and revisionist power immediately gained
renewed salience, although today the front line is considerably farther
eastward than during the Cold War. Further complicating matters, despite
any number of assurances by Brussels, Russia has made clear that it
views NATO's eastward expansion as counter to its own interests, and it
views the existence of the alliance itself as a threat. Yet NATO is
managing to both address the challenge of a revanchist Russia and tackle
a broader array of security challenges to the alliance, including China,
climate change, and advanced disruptive technologies.

More broadly, the lines between foreign and domestic policy, war and
peace, civilian and military, public and private are all being blurred,
calling long-standing approaches to contending with security and defense
challenges into question. Nontraditional security challenges including
disinformation operations, pandemic response, migration, and terrorism
have put significant stress on the governments of allies on both sides
of the Atlantic. None of these challenges can be tackled by one state
alone, not even by the United States. And in these blurry spaces, NATO
can---and has---played an important role in catalyzing solutions for
these complex problems. For example, NATO played a key role in
facilitating the international community's response to the rise of the
Islamic State, plans formed in the margins of the 2014 summit in Wales.

[[Strategic leadership, strategic depth, and strategic flexibility
are]{.mark} why [NATO's value]{.mark} is difficult to overstate. [It is
a political-military arrangement that has proved]{.mark} remarkably
[resilient]{.mark} over decades [and has]{.mark} consistently
[demonstrated its value to its members on both sides of the
Atlantic]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is arguably why Vladimir Putin's
Russia is so intent on undermining it.

The strategic conundrum for the United States---and for its NATO
allies---is therefore how to keep intact the alliance system that serves
as the bedrock for myriad social, economic, and political benefits to
its members in the face of an aggressive adversary. But defend its old
and new allies alike the United States must. Otherwise, it risks losing
a leadership position and benefits that have become a central, if
overlooked, aspect of American prosperity. In a very real way, the
security of NATO allies is inextricably linked with American interests.

[[Democrats]{.mark} could [experience]{.mark} a "[greater-than-average"
loss]{.mark} in the [midterm elections]{.mark} this
November,]{.underline} new Gallup polling suggests, finding that
[[voters' satisfaction with]{.mark} the [country and]{.mark} federal
[government]{.mark} are largely [at record lows compared]{.mark} with
[other]{.mark} midterm [years]{.mark}.]{.underline} President Biden
Returns To The White House From Delaware President Joe Biden waves as he
returns to the White House June 13 in Washington, DC. The [[Gallup
poll]{.mark}, conducted May 2-22 among 1,007 U.S. adults, [found]{.mark}
only [41% approve]{.mark} of President Joe [Biden']{.mark}s job
performance, 18% approve of Congress' performance and 16% are "satisfied
with the way things are going in the U.S."]{.underline} Only 14% have a
positive view of economic conditions right now and 46% rate the economy
negatively, meaning Americans have a 32-point net negative view of the
economy. All of those [[metrics are]{.mark} at least [10 points
below]{.mark} the [average]{.mark} for midterm years, [based on]{.mark}
Gallup's [polling]{.mark} going back to 1974.]{.underline} PROMOTED
Americans have a 51% approval rating for the president on average during
midterm election years, a 30% congressional approval rating, 35%
satisfaction with the state of the U.S. and a nine-point net positive
rating of the economy. Other than presidential approval rating---where
Biden's 41% approval is tied with former President Donald Trump's in
2018 and higher than President George W. Bush's 38% in 2006---[[every
metric]{.mark} recorded this year [marks]{.mark} a [historic
low]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Gallup suggests the [low ratings mean]{.mark}
[Democrats]{.mark} will likely [lose seats]{.mark} in the election this
year]{.underline}---as a president's party typically does during the
midterms---and their losses would likely be even larger than usual if
these low ratings hold. BIG NUMBER 23. That's the average number of
House seats a president's party loses during the midterms, Gallup found
based on data going back to 1974[. Parties suffer even bigger losses
when Americans aren't satisfied with how things are going,
though]{.underline}: [Republicans lost 40 seats in 2018]{.underline}
when Americans had a 21% positive view of Congress and 41% approval of
Trump, for instance, and [Democrats lost 63 seats in 2010 during Barack
Obama's presidency]{.underline}. Though Obama was slightly more popular
than Biden (45% approval), Americans similarly had a 21% approval of
Congress, 22% satisfaction with the U.S. and 31-point net-negative view
of the economy that year. WHAT TO WATCH FOR How Democrats will fare in
the midterms[. [Republicans]{.mark} only [need]{.mark} to [flip five
House seats]{.mark} to gain [control of the chamber]{.mark}, and [one
seat in]{.mark} the [Senate]{.mark}]{.underline}, where the parties are
now evenly split. Based on current trends, [Gallup projects the
[midterms will]{.mark} potentially [be]{.mark} a [**"wave election"**
for]{.mark} the [GOP]{.mark} [and give]{.mark} them a ["comfortable
governing majority]{.mark}."]{.underline} WHAT WE DON'T KNOW How things
could change before November for Democrats[. The Supreme Court is poised
to likely overturn Roe v. Wade and let states ban abortion in the coming
weeks, for instance, which recent polling has suggested may help
galvanize Democrats and get more to the polls]{.underline}. Gun control
could also come into play in the wake of a string of mass shootings,
Gallup notes, as polling shows most Americans favor stricter gun
measures and thus could be motivated to vote against Republicans who
oppose them. KEY BACKGROUND Gallup's polling comes as Biden has seen
record-low approval ratings in recent months, with a FiveThirtyEight
analysis finding 39.7% approve of him on average---the lowest share at
any point during his presidency. [The president has not had an average
approval rating over 50% since August 2021]{.underline}. Other polls
have similarly found Republicans are likely to have a clear advantage in
the midterms[, with a FiveThirtyEight poll analysis finding 45% of
Americans prefer to vote for a Republican candidate in November versus a
Democrat (42.6% would support the Democrat)]{.underline}. A Morning
Consult/Politico poll from May found Republicans were still more
enthusiastic about voting in the midterms than Democrats (61% versus
54%), even after Politico leaked a draft opinion suggesting the Supreme
Court will overturn Roe v. Wade.

(CNN)[[Last month, Newt Gingrich made a]{.mark} bold (and seemingly

House speaker]{.underline} [[said in an interview with
Fox](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/newt-gingrich-predicts-gop-could-pick-up-historic-70-house-seats)**.
[Seventy seats!]{.mark}**]{.underline} That would not only eclipse the
63-seat gain Republicans made in the 2010 midterm elections, but would
also be the largest seat switch in the House since 1948. Gingrich, as he
often does, was likely just riffing \-- going for an outlandishly high
ceiling on Republican gains to draw headlines and attention. Which,
well, mission accomplished. Gingrich\'s ceiling of 70 seats is well in
excess of where nonpartisan political handicappers are \-- at least at
the moment. David Wasserman, the House editor at the [[Cook Political
Report with Amy
Walter]{.underline}](https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/house-overview/house-rating-changes-10-more-races-move-towards-republicans),
is projecting Republicans gain between 20 and 35 seats. Nathan Gonzales

hasn\'t released his range just yet \-- it\'s coming next week \-- but
says[, [\"Republicans are well positioned to win the
**majority.**\"]{.mark} New data from Gallup suggests that the national
political environment is arguably worse for Democrats than it was in
2010 \--]{.underline} raising at least the possibility that the party
suffers even larger losses than currently predicted. [[As Gallup\'s
Jeffrey M. Jones and Lydia Saad
write]{.underline}](https://news.gallup.com/poll/393626/usual-midterm-indicators-unfavorable-democrats.aspx):
\"The party of the president typically loses U.S. House seats in midterm
elections \-- an average of 23 since 1974. However, 2022 is not shaping
up to be an average year. Rather, as of May, Gallup finds presidential
job approval and three other key national mood indicators well below the
historical averages measured in past midterm election years. On their
own**[[, those numbers would all predict a greater-]{.mark}than-average
[loss of seats for the Democratic Party]{.mark} this
fall.\"]{.underline}** A glance at the [[Gallup
data]{.underline}](https://news.gallup.com/poll/393626/usual-midterm-indicators-unfavorable-democrats.aspx)
\-- which looks at presidential approval, congressional approval,
satisfaction with the direction of the country and overall judgment of
economic conditions \-- reveals that the environment that was measured
in May looks a lot like it did at the end of the 2010 cycle. [[Consider:
2022]{.mark} [Biden approval: 41% Congressional approval: 18% US
satisfaction: 16% Economic conditions (net): -32 2010 Obama approval:
45% Congressional approval: 21% US satisfaction: 22% Economic conditions
(net): -31]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Pretty similar,
right?]{.underline}]{.mark} If anything, the national political
environment \-- as understood through these four factors \-- is worse
for Democrats now than it was in 2010. Now, before you sign on to
Gingrich\'s 70-seat prediction, it\'s worth considering that: a) The
past two national redistricting processes (in 2011 and 2021) have,
broadly speaking, created more safe districts that are virtually certain
to elect a member of one party. b) The 2020 election, in which
Republicans netted 12 House seats, likely limits the ceiling of GOP
gains since some of the lower-hanging fruit has already been, um,
picked. To be very clear here: A 70-seat Republican gain in the fall
still feels more like a Gingrich fever dream than a fact-based
possibility. But as [[Gallup
concludes](https://news.gallup.com/poll/393626/usual-midterm-indicators-unfavorable-democrats.aspx):
\"[The current]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Democratic]{.mark} congressiona[l

shape]{.mark} as they have been at this point of a midterm election as
they have been in many decades. And what\'s worse for the party is that
there\'s no obvious event or series of events that could (or will) turn

[[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s could experience a "greater-than-average" loss in
the midterm elections this November,]{.mark} new Gallup polling
suggests, finding that voters' [satisfaction]{.mark} with the country
and federal government are [largely at record lows]{.mark} compared with
other midterm years.]{.underline} President Biden Returns To The White
House From Delaware President Joe Biden waves as he returns to the White
House June 13 in Washington, DC. GETTY IMAGES KEY FACTS [The Gallup
poll, conducted May 2-22 among 1,007 U.S. adults, found only [41%
approve of President Joe Biden's job performance, 18% approve of
Congress' performance and 16% are "satisfied]{.mark} with the way things
are going in the U.S." Only 14% have a positive view of economic
conditions right now and 46% rate the economy negatively, meaning
Americans have a 32-point net negative view of the economy. All of those
metrics are at least 10 points below the average for midterm years,
based on Gallup's polling going back to 1974.]{.underline} PROMOTED
Americans have a [[51% approval rating for the president on
average]{.mark} during midterm election years, [a 30% congressional
approval rating, 35% satisfaction with the state of the
U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} and a nine-point net positive rating of the
economy. Other than presidential approval rating---[[where Biden's 41%
approval is tied with former President Donald Trump's in 2018]{.mark}
and higher than President George W. Bush's 38% in
2006]{.underline}---every metric recorded this year marks a historic
low. Gallup suggests the low ratings mean Democrats will likely lose
seats in the election this year---as a president's party typically does
during the midterms---and their losses would likely be even larger than
usual if these low ratings hold. BIG NUMBER 23. That's the average
number of House seats a president's party loses during the midterms,
Gallup found based on data going back to 1974. [[Parties suffer even
bigger losses when Americans aren't satisfied]{.mark} with how things
are going, though: Republicans lost 40 seats in 2018 when Americans had
a 21% positive view of Congress and 41% approval of Trump, for instance,
and Democrats lost 63 seats in 2010 during Barack Obama's
presidency.]{.underline} Though Obama was slightly more popular than
Biden (45% approval), Americans similarly had a 21% approval of
Congress, 22% satisfaction with the U.S. and 31-point net-negative view
of the economy that year. WHAT TO WATCH FOR How Democrats will fare in
the midterms. Republicans only need to flip five House seats to gain
control of the chamber, and one seat in the Senate, where the parties
are now evenly split. [[Based on current trends, Gallup projects the
midterms will potentially be a "wave election]{.mark}" for the GOP and
give them a "comfortable governing majority." WHAT [WE DON'T KNOW How
things could change before November for Democrats]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The Supreme Court is poised to likely overturn Roe v. Wade and let
states ban abortion in the coming weeks, for instance, which recent
polling has suggested may help galvanize Democrats and get more to the
polls. Gun control could also come into play in the wake of a string of
mass shootings, Gallup notes, as polling shows most Americans favor
stricter gun measures and thus could be motivated to vote against
Republicans who oppose them. KEY BACKGROUND Gallup's polling comes as
Biden has seen record-low approval ratings in recent months, with a
FiveThirtyEight analysis finding 39.7% approve of him on average---the
lowest share at any point during his presidency[. [The president has not
had an average approval rating over 50% since August
2021]{.mark}.]{.underline} Other polls have similarly found Republicans
are likely to have a clear advantage in the midterms, with a
FiveThirtyEight poll analysis finding 45% of Americans prefer to vote
for a Republican candidate in November versus a Democrat (42.6% would
support the Democrat). A Morning Consult/Politico poll from May found
Republicans were still more enthusiastic about voting in the midterms
than Democrats (61% versus 54%), even after Politico leaked a draft
opinion suggesting the Supreme Court will overturn Roe v. Wade.

[[Democrats hope to make]{.mark} November's [midterm elections a
referendum on Roe]{.mark} v. Wade]{.underline}, the linchpin decision
upholding abortion rights, which the Supreme Court is almost certain to
strike down this summer. That strategy makes sense. [[Polls show]{.mark}
that roughly [two in three]{.mark} Americans [oppose overturning Roe and
almost 60 percent support]{.mark} passing a [bill to set Roe's
protections in]{.mark} a [federal law]{.mark}.]{.underline} What's more,
polls showed a rising number of voters listing abortion as their top
midterm issue after news of Roe's imminent demise leaked in the form of
a draft court opinion published by Politico. [[Unfortunately, their
current plan is]{.mark} almost [sure to fail]{.mark}.]{.underline} After
the [[Democrats came up with just 49 votes]{.mark} to bring a
Roe-protecting bill before the Senate]{.underline} on May 11, they
promised to keep fighting and, in the words of Senator Amy Klobuchar,
"take that fight right to the ballot box" in November. [[But you can't
make an election into a referendum]{.mark} on an issue [if you can't
point to anything winning the election]{.mark} would
accomplish.]{.underline} To make the 2022 elections a referendum on Roe,
Democrats have to put protecting Roe and abortion rights on the table.
Here's one way to do that: get clear public commitments from every
Senate Democrat (and candidate for Senate) [[not only to vote for the
Roe bill in January 2023 but also to change the filibuster rules to
ensure that a majority vote would actually pass]{.mark} the bill and
send it to the White House for the president's signature.]{.underline}
At present, there are [likely [48 Senate Democrats]{.mark} who [can make
that pledge]{.mark}. [Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are dead
set against any changes to the filibuster]{.mark}]{.underline} --- a
fact you likely know because most of President Biden's agenda has been
bottled up behind their refusal for the past year. Some claim that
Senators Manchin and Sinema are just taking the public heat for a number
of other Senate Democrats who are also unwilling to change the
filibuster rules. That's highly unlikely. But if any do have misgivings,
that's why the public commitments are so important. Getting a list of
holdouts down to a publicly named handful is the first step to
persuading them to fall in line. If my math is right and there are 48
Senate Democrats ready to make that pledge, they need two additional
Democratic senators in the next Congress. And that is the party's
message that makes the 2022 midterms a referendum on Roe: "Give us the
House and two more senators, and we will make No ambiguity, no haggling,
no living in Senator Manchin's head for a year. You give us this, and
we'll give you that. That tells voters exactly what will be delivered
with a Democratic win. It also defines what constitutes a win: control
of the House and two more Senate seats. The campaign message is clear:
If you want to protect Roe, give us those majorities. If this is your
passion, here's where to channel that passion. These are the Senate
seats we need to hold (in New Hampshire, Arizona, Georgia and Nevada)
and here are the ones we need to win (in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and
possibly in Ohio, Florida and North Carolina). With those commitments in
hand, one question should be on the lips of every Democratic candidate.
Will you make a firm commitment to never vote for a federal law banning
abortion nationwide? [[Few,]{.mark} if any, [Republicans would be able
to make that pledge.]{.mark} And their evasions wouldn't just make them
look ridiculous; that would put squarely on the table the very real
threat that Republicans would enact a nationwide abortion ban as soon as
January 2025. That could prove enough to win Senate races in
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Ohio.]{.underline} In a way, though, this
strategy isn't so much about winning the 2022 midterms or even making
Roe into a federal law, although it's the best way to accomplish both.
It's just an example of how you win elections. Effective campaigns are
built on connecting the intense beliefs of the electorate --- their
hopes and fears --- directly to the hard mechanics of political power.
You've got to connect those wires. If you were testing some new
electrical contraption, that's the first thing you'd do: make sure the
energy supply is wired to the engine that makes it run. This is no
different. Without tying a specific electoral result to a clear
commitment to a specific legislative action after the elections, you're
not connecting those wires. What Democrats would be proposing is a
classic small-c conservative solution in the best sense of the word.
Codifying Roe would preserve the set of rights and protections that the
vast majority of Americans have lived their entire adult lives with and
that the overwhelming majority of Americans do not want to change. The
threat that the court will strike down such a law is real but
overstated. And in any case, refusing to act because of what opponents
might do is the definition of political paralysis. So how do Democrats
get from here to there? They likely can't rely on the party's leaders,
at least not at first. But they're not essential. It's really up to
voters and activists and particularly committed members of Congress.
Probably half the Democrats in the Senate would be happy to sign on this
dotted line by the end of the day. Those who are up for re-election,
even in safe races, will come around quickly. Some senators may resist
at first. And that wouldn't be surprising. Politicians seldom see any
advantage to committing themselves in advance or reducing their room for
maneuver. It's always safer to keep your options open and be as general
as possible until the final moment. That's why assembling a clear public
list of commitments is critical. Once the list gets down to a handful of
hesitaters, the pressure from Democrats nationwide, focused on those
members, will be overwhelming. If there are real holdouts, they'll fold
in short order. You don't need to wait on Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer
or President Biden. You can get the ball rolling by calling up your
Democratic senator today.

#### Midterms are not looking hopeful for Dems

WASHINGTON, D.C. \-- With less than five months to go before voters
elect all members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the
Senate, the current Democratic congressional majority is facing an
extremely unfavorable election environment. The party of the president
typically loses U.S. House seats in midterm elections \-- an average of
23 since 1974. **[However, [2022 is not shaping up to be an average
year.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Rather, as of May, Gallup finds
presidential job approval and three other key national mood indicators
well below the historical averages measured in past midterm election
years. On their own, those numbers would all predict a
greater-than-average loss of seats for the Democratic Party this fall.
**[[Gallup\'s latest data, from a May 2-22 survey, finds 41% of
Americans [approving of the job President Joe Biden is
doing](https://news.gallup.com/poll/393038/satisfaction-dips-biden-approval-steady.aspx),
18% approving of the job Congress is doing, 16% satisfied with the way
things are going in the U.S., and a 32-percentage-point deficit in
positive (14%) versus negative (46%) ratings of current economic
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Each of those metrics is at least 10
points lower than the historical average at the time of past midterm
elections, and most are on pace to be the worst of such readings. The
following sections of this report discuss how each of these four polling
indicators, as well as party affiliation, has related to midterm
election outcomes historically. Midterm elections are widely seen as a
referendum on the incumbent president, and this is justified by the high
correspondence between overall job approval and seat loss for the
president\'s party. Given this, congressional seat losses for unpopular
presidents\' parties have been above average historically, [averaging 37
since
1946](https://news.gallup.com/poll/242093/midterm-seat-loss-averages-unpopular-presidents.aspx)**[[.
Biden\'s current 41% approval rating puts him in the lower tier of all
prior presidents\' job approval ratings taken just before past midterm
elections. Biden currently has the same approval rating that Donald
Trump did at the time of the 2018 elections, when the GOP lost 40 House
seats, and similar to Ronald Reagan\'s 42% in October 1982, before the
Republicans lost 26 seats.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Only one president,
George W. Bush, had a lower rating than Biden does today, and his 38%
rating in November 2006 was associated with a 30-seat loss. Biden\'s
fellow Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama lost an even larger
number of House seats in 1994 and 2010, respectively, with slightly
higher approval ratings than Biden has now. Those steeper losses reflect
the relatively large number of House seats held by Democrats going into
those elections in addition to the president\'s unpopularity. The
Democratic Party lost fewer seats in Obama\'s second midterm in 2014
when Obama was no more popular than in his first midterm four years
earlier, but Democrats were defending fewer seats. In the few elections
where the president\'s party has gained seats (1998 and 2002) or lost a
small number of seats (1986 and 1990), the incumbent president has been
broadly popular, with approval ratings well above 50%. The exception was
1974, with Gerald Ford\'s 54% job approval more reflective of his
honeymoon period in the months after he took office following Richard
Nixon\'s resignation in August of that year. The GOP\'s 43-seat loss was
likely tied to Nixon\'s unpopularity (24% approval in his last rating)
stemming from the Watergate scandal that led to his resignation. While
Biden\'s job approval rating could improve by November, putting his
party in a less precarious position, he would be bucking the trend for
second-year presidents. Historically, presidents\' job approval ratings
have [rarely
improved](https://news.gallup.com/poll/391973/biden-job-approval-stuck-low-40s.aspx) in
the last few months before their first midterms. Democrats currently
hold 220 seats in the House, just two above the number needed for a
majority, and far fewer than the 250-plus they held before the
Republican wave elections of 1994 and 2010. This relatively low seat
exposure could help to check Democratic losses, as occurred in 2014. The
18% of Americans who approve of the job Congress is doing would be the
lowest Gallup has measured in a midterm election if it holds at that
level through the fall. However, it would not be much lower than the 20%
to 21% approval ratings for Congress at the time of the past three
midterm elections. Americans\' view of the job Congress is doing is also
broadly predictive of how the president\'s party \-- if not also the
majority party in Congress \-- will perform in the midterms. In 1994,
2010 and 2018 \-- all years when Congress\' approval rating was between
21% and 23% and the president\'s party was in the majority \-- the
incumbent party lost between 40 and 63 House seats. In 2014, even with
approval of Congress at 20%, the Democratic Party lost only 13 seats \--
again explained by Democrats\' weak starting position that year when
House Republicans were in the majority. In years when congressional
approval was significantly higher, the president\'s party suffered
minimal losses or even gained seats. Americans\' satisfaction with the
way things are going in the U.S. is also on pace to be the worst it has
been in a midterm election year. The 16% currently satisfied is six
points lower than the prior midterm low \-- 22% in 2010. Satisfaction
relates to midterm House seat loss in a similar way as the job approval
variables, with greater losses tending to happen in elections when
satisfaction is low \-- such as in 1982 (24%), 1994 (30%) and 2010 (22%)
\-- and more minimal losses or gains for the president\'s party in years
when satisfaction is high, including 1986 (58%), 1998 (60%) and 2002
(48%). Gallup has a shorter history of measuring Americans\' perceptions
of current U.S. economic conditions, dating back to the early 1990s.
Since that time, Americans\' views of the economy during midterm
election years have only ever been similarly bad as now once before \--
in 2010, when net ratings of economic conditions were -31. Economic
ratings tend to be less strongly related to midterm election outcomes
than other mood indicators are, though views of the economy certainly
influence how Americans rate the job that political leaders are doing
and whether they are satisfied with the way things are going in the
country. Positive evaluations of the economy in 2006 and 2018 were not
enough to overcome weak job approval ratings for Presidents Bush and
Trump, respectively, and for Congress, suggesting political leaders were
being evaluated on factors besides the economy. But even if the economy
is less correlated with midterm election outcomes, the fact that
Americans view it negatively this year is just one more issue that does
not reflect favorably on the governing Democratic Party. Vote choices in
elections are strongly tied to a voter\'s political leanings. Party
affiliation has been a good indicator of midterm election outcomes in
the past because it either related to the partisanship of the electorate
or was a harbinger of **[how]{.underline}** people would vote. On
average over the past three months, Americans have been equally likely
to identify politically as Republicans or say they are independents who
lean toward the Republican Party (45%) as to identify as Democrats or to
lean Democratic (45%). While the parties appear, then, to be on equal
footing heading into the midterms, the figures are generally a better
sign for the Republican Party than the Democratic Party for two key
reasons: First, historically, Democrats usually have an advantage on
this measure of party affiliation. For example,
in [2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/388781/political-party-preferences-shifted-greatly-during-2021.aspx),
Democrats had a three-point advantage (though the numbers varied greatly
over the course of the year), which is typical. Second, Republican
voters usually turn out at higher rates than Democratic voters do. If
usual turnout patterns hold, and partisanship among all national adults
is even, then the electorate will have more Republican identifiers and
leaners than Democratic ones. There were also even splits in party
affiliation in 1994, 2002, 2010, 2014 and 2018 election years, and all
but one were good years for Republican candidates. The major exception
was 2018, a year in which the parties were fairly evenly matched but
Democrats did better in the elections, perhaps because of Trump\'s
unpopularity and the [unusually high
turnout](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/19/18103110/2018-midterm-elections-turnout?utm_source=link_newsv9&utm_campaign=item_393626&utm_medium=copy) that
year. By contrast, in years when the Democratic Party had sizable
advantages on party identification, like in 1998 and 2006, Democrats
picked up seats in Congress. At the same time, the relatively slim
majority enjoyed by House Democrats should shield the party from losses
in the upper range of what\'s possible when presidential approval is in
the low 40s and less than a quarter of Americans are satisfied with the
state of the nation. While it is unclear whether policy issues can
eclipse presidential performance or the national mood as midterm
election voting factors, **[[Democrats may benefit politically from the

will be [a more important voting
factor](https://news.gallup.com/poll/393263/abortion-poised-bigger-voting-issue-past.aspx) this
year than it usually is in U.S. elections, more so among those who
support rather than oppose legalized abortion. Also, even before the
mass shootings, the majority of Americans expressed dissatisfaction
with [U.S. gun
laws](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/393092/americans-recent-attitudes-toward-guns.aspx) and
favored enacting stricter laws. On the other hand, further increases in
gas prices or renewed focus on the border crisis could compound
Democrats\' problems in November. **[Regardless of what issues might

[The Republican party is widely expected to win back]{.underline} at
least one chamber of Congress [in the mid-term elections later this
year.]{.underline} But its leaders have been reluctant to say what it
would do with [that power]{.underline} --- and that [could mean trouble
in the not-so-long run.]{.underline}

Some [Republican 2024 presidential hopefuls have each released
multi-point policy agendas that they may try to build a campaign
around]{.underline}. But those in [the Republican congressional
leadership seem to believe that the path to power will be smoother if
they keep the details of their agenda intentionally vague. It keeps
their party united and gives Democrats less of a target to
attack.]{.underline}

For the seventh time in 22 years, control of at least one chamber of the
US Congress appears poised to switch to the opposing party, and [this
time, it\'s the Republicans who have the upper hand.]{.underline}

According to polls, a plurality of [Americans plan to vote for
Republican congressional candidates - a good sign of impending success.
And they only need to flip a handful of seats to take
control.]{.underline}

In 2022, the Republicans look like they will be taking the playbook from
a more recent mid-term. [In 2014, they took control of the Senate with a
campaign that primarily featured attacks on then-President Obama and
warnings about the domestic threat posed by Ebola virus and Islamic
State militants.]{.underline}

[This year, the Republican Party leadership seems to have settled on a
similar path]{.underline}. That means focusing its messaging on
dissatisfaction with President Joe Biden and the Democrats, rather than
advancing a particular governing agenda.

#### Why Republicans Are Favored to Win The House, 

[Nate Silver](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nate-silver/)
[JUN. 30, 2022]{.smallcaps}

Republicans are substantial favorites to take over the U.S. House of
Representatives following this November's midterm elections, but the
U.S. Senate is much more competitive, according to [FiveThirtyEight's
2022 midterm election
forecast](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/),
which launched today. Democrats are also favored to hang on to the
governorships in a trio of swing states in the Rust Belt ---
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan --- although they are significant
underdogs to win high-profile gubernatorial races in Georgia and Texas
against Republican incumbents.

The split diagnosis reflects the difference between macro- and
micro-level conditions. [The national environment is quite poor for
Democrats. Of course, this is typical for the president's party, which
has lost seats in the House in ]{.underline}[all but two of the past 21
midterm
elections](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/seats-congress-gainedlost-the-presidents-party-mid-term-elections)[.]{.underline}
But Democrats are also saddled with [an unpopular President
Biden](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/) and
a series of challenges for the country, including inflation levels that
haven't been seen in decades, [the lingering effects of the
still-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and ]{.underline}[fraying trust in civic
institutions](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democratic-values-are-still-under-attack-even-without-trump-in-the-white-house/)[ ---
caused, in part, by ]{.underline}[Republican efforts to overturn the
results of the 2022
election](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/28/us/jan-6-hearing-today). 

Democrats, as a [predominantly urban
party](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-in-blue-cities-are-increasingly-outliers/),
also face a longstanding problem in the Senate, where every state has
equal representation regardless of its population, [resulting in
a ]{.underline}[substantial built-in bias toward white, rural
states](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senates-rural-skew-makes-it-very-hard-for-democrats-to-win-the-supreme-court/)[.
And although Democrats are ]{.underline}[very slightly better off
following the redistricting process in the
House](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/)[ than
they were under the 2020 maps, there are still more Republican-leaning
seats than Democratic-leaning ones.]{.underline}

True, the political environment is dynamic. The Supreme
Court's [decision last week to overturn Roe v.
Wade](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roe-v-wade-defined-an-era-the-supreme-court-just-started-a-new-one/) is
too recent to be fully reflected in polls, but there are reasons to
think it will help Democrats. Roe, which granted the constitutional
right to abortion,* *[was a popular
precedent](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/06/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-despite-public-opinion/),
and Democratic voters are [more likely than Republican
ones](https://thehill.com/homenews/3537982-democrats-more-likely-to-vote-in-midterms-after-abortion-ruling-poll/) to
say the decision will encourage them to vote at the midterms.

Moreover, in [striking down Roe and ]{.underline}[other popular
laws](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/04/20/amid-a-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-u-s-gun-policy-remains-deeply-divisive/)[ like ]{.underline}[restrictions
against the concealed carry of
firearms](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-supreme-courts-gun-ruling-means-for-gun-control/)[,
the Supreme Court has in some ways undermined one of the traditional
reasons that the president's party tends to lose seats at the
midterms.]{.underline} Typically, voters like some degree of balance:
They do not want one party to have unfettered control of all levers of
government. But the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority,
is a reminder of how much power Republicans have even if they don't
control the White House.

The insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 can also serve as a
reminder to voters about what might happen if the Electoral College
certification process takes place in 2024 amid Republican control of
both chambers of
Congress.[^1^](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/#fn-1) Democrats
have [had trouble getting the public to treat threats to democracy as a
high
priority](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-moving-on-from-jan-6-even-if-congress-hasnt/),
but polls do show that the [public is sympathetic to the Democrats'
case](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/06/23/what-are-americans-thinking-about-the-january-6-hearings/),
especially after the recent congressional hearings on the events of Jan.
6.

So, this is not a typical, low-stakes midterm election. On the contrary,
there are strong forces tugging at each side of the rope, some of which
are potentially of existential importance.

But Democrats' majorities in both chambers of Congress are narrow, the
historical precedent toward the president's party losing seats is
strong, and polls so far --- such as the [generic congressional
ballot](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/),
which asks voters which party they would support in an election ---
suggest that voters slightly prefer Republican control of Congress.

Or at least that's the story in the House, where there are dozens of
competitive races and candidates are relatively anonymous. There,
big-picture factors tend to prevail. An unusually weak Republican
candidate in one district might be counteracted by a strong one in
another, for example.

[In the Senate and gubernatorial races, by contrast, individual factors
can matter more. And the GOP has nominated --- or is poised to nominate
--- candidates who might significantly underperform a
"generic"]{.underline} Republican based on dsome combination
of [inexperience](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/19/pennsylvania-republicans-dr-oz-senate-bid-523023), [personal
scandals](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/us/politics/herschel-walker-children.html) or [having
articulated unpopular conservative
positions](https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-gop-senate-candidate-masters-privatizing-social-security-2022-6).
This is not a new problem for Republicans: underqualified or fringy
candidates have [cost them seats in the Senate in other recent
cycles](https://www.politico.com/story/2012/08/akin-legitimate-rape-victims-dont-get-pregnant-079864). 

So let's briefly run through the model's forecast for House, Senate and
gubernatorial races. Then I'll describe some changes to the model since
2020 --- which are modest this year but reflect how congressional races
are changing in an increasingly polarized political environment.

**The House**

[Republicans have ]{.underline}[an 87 percent chance of taking over the
House](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house)[,
according to the Deluxe version of our model.]{.underline} That's far
from certain, [but Democrats are fighting the odds: Their 13 percent
chances are equivalent to tossing a coin and having it come up tails
three times in a row.]{.underline}

That's not to say House control will be a matter of luck, exactly. A
change in the political environment could have ripple effects. For
instance, sometimes one party wins nearly all the toss-up races,
as [Republicans did in
2020](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-house.html).
However, even if Democrats were to win all 13 races that our model
currently designates as "toss-ups" (meaning that no party has more than
a 60 percent chance of winning), plus hold on to all the seats in which
they're favored, they would still wind up with only 208 seats, 10 short
of the number they need for a majority. 

Instead, [Democrats will also have to win some seats where Republican
candidates are currently favored, and that requires the national
political environment in November to be more favorable for Democrats
than our model is currently expecting.]{.underline}

On the one hand, the task isn't *that* daunting for Democrats. Our model
calculates that Democrats would be favored to keep the House if they win
the House popular vote --- or lose it by less than 0.7 percentage points
--- something that Democrats did in both 2018 and 2020. 

Moreover, Democrats are down by only about 2 points in our [current
average of generic-ballot
polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/).
Given the inherent error in polling, and how much time there is between
now and November, it isn't hard to turn a 2-point deficit in the polls
into a 1-point win.

However, in important ways, that 2-point deficit understates the degree
of trouble that Democrats are in. One reason is because many of those
polls are conducted among registered voters rather than likely voters,
and the electorate that turns out in November is likely to be more
Republican than the broader universe of all registered voters.
Historically, the patterns in midterm elections are that: [1)
Republicans turn out more than Democrats, and 2) voters for whichever
party doesn't control the presidency are more enthusiastic and turn out
more. In 2018, those factors canceled one another out]{.underline}.
Democrats, not controlling the presidency, were the more enthusiastic
party, helping to neutralize the Republicans' historical turnout
advantage. This year, though, they both work in the favor of
Republicans.

Thus, the model adjusts those registered-voter polls based on its
estimate of what likely-voter polls would show, and when it does that,
the Republicans' generic-ballot lead is really more like 4 points than 2
points. I should note that this adjustment is not rigid in the model.
Although the model uses historical turnout patterns as its baseline
assumption, it will override that based on polls. In other words, if
polls come out showing Democrats holding their own among likely voters
--- such as because of increased Democratic enthusiasm in the wake of
Roe being overturned --- the model will adjust to reflect that. Put
another way, a very strong turnout would give Democrats a fighting
chance of keeping the House.

But also, the generic ballot isn't the only input that the model
considers, and some of the other factors look worse for Democrats than
the generic ballot does. Based on the historical tendency for the
president's party to lose seats in the midterms and Biden's poor
approval rating, for instance, the situation is more likely to get worse
for Democrats than better. The model also evaluates factors such as
polling and fundraising data in individual races.

Overall, the Deluxe forecast expects [Democrats to eventually lose the
popular vote for the House by closer to 6 points, about the margin that
they lost it by
in ]{.underline}[2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections)[.
And it expects Republicans to wind up with 237 seats in an average
outcome, a gain of 24 seats from the 213 they had at the start of the
current
Congress.]{.underline}[^2^](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/#fn-2)

#### Midterms are not looking hopeful for Dems 

**Gallup 6/14** \[Gallup, Inc., 6-14-2022, \"Usual Midterm Indicators

JV and LW

WASHINGTON, D.C. \-- With less than five months to go before voters
elect all members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the
Senate, the current Democratic congressional majority is facing an
extremely unfavorable election environment. The party of the president
typically loses U.S. House seats in midterm elections \-- an average of
23 since 1974. **[However, 2022 is not shaping up to be an average
year.]{.underline}** Rather, as of May, Gallup finds presidential job
approval and three other key national mood indicators well below the
historical averages measured in past midterm election years. On their
own, those numbers would all predict a greater-than-average loss of
seats for the Democratic Party this fall. **[Gallup\'s latest data, from
a May 2-22 survey, finds 41% of Americans ]{.underline}[approving of the
job President Joe Biden is
doing](https://news.gallup.com/poll/393038/satisfaction-dips-biden-approval-steady.aspx)[,
18% approving of the job Congress is doing, 16% satisfied with the way
things are going in the U.S., and a 32-percentage-point deficit in
positive (14%) versus negative (46%) ratings of current economic
conditions]{.underline}**. Each of those metrics is at least 10 points
lower than the historical average at the time of past midterm elections,
and most are on pace to be the worst of such readings. The following
sections of this report discuss how each of these four polling
indicators, as well as party affiliation, has related to midterm
election outcomes historically. Midterm elections are widely seen as a
referendum on the incumbent president, and this is justified by the high
correspondence between overall job approval and seat loss for the
president\'s party. Given this, congressional seat losses for unpopular
presidents\' parties have been above average historically, [averaging 37
since
1946](https://news.gallup.com/poll/242093/midterm-seat-loss-averages-unpopular-presidents.aspx)**[.
Biden\'s current 41% approval rating puts him in the lower tier of all
prior presidents\' job approval ratings taken just before past midterm
elections. Biden currently has the same approval rating that Donald
Trump did at the time of the 2018 elections, when the GOP lost 40 House
seats, and similar to Ronald Reagan\'s 42% in October 1982, before the
Republicans lost 26 seats.]{.underline}** Only one president, George W.
Bush, had a lower rating than Biden does today, and his 38% rating in
November 2006 was associated with a 30-seat loss. Biden\'s fellow
Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama lost an even larger number of
House seats in 1994 and 2010, respectively, with slightly higher
approval ratings than Biden has now. Those steeper losses reflect the
relatively large number of House seats held by Democrats going into
those elections in addition to the president\'s unpopularity. The
Democratic Party lost fewer seats in Obama\'s second midterm in 2014
when Obama was no more popular than in his first midterm four years
earlier, but Democrats were defending fewer seats. In the few elections
where the president\'s party has gained seats (1998 and 2002) or lost a
small number of seats (1986 and 1990), the incumbent president has been
broadly popular, with approval ratings well above 50%. The exception was
1974, with Gerald Ford\'s 54% job approval more reflective of his
honeymoon period in the months after he took office following Richard
Nixon\'s resignation in August of that year. The GOP\'s 43-seat loss was
likely tied to Nixon\'s unpopularity (24% approval in his last rating)
stemming from the Watergate scandal that led to his resignation. While
Biden\'s job approval rating could improve by November, putting his
party in a less precarious position, he would be bucking the trend for
second-year presidents. Historically, presidents\' job approval ratings
have [rarely
improved](https://news.gallup.com/poll/391973/biden-job-approval-stuck-low-40s.aspx) in
the last few months before their first midterms. Democrats currently
hold 220 seats in the House, just two above the number needed for a
majority, and far fewer than the 250-plus they held before the
Republican wave elections of 1994 and 2010. This relatively low seat
exposure could help to check Democratic losses, as occurred in 2014. The
18% of Americans who approve of the job Congress is doing would be the
lowest Gallup has measured in a midterm election if it holds at that
level through the fall. However, it would not be much lower than the 20%
to 21% approval ratings for Congress at the time of the past three
midterm elections. Americans\' view of the job Congress is doing is also
broadly predictive of how the president\'s party \-- if not also the
majority party in Congress \-- will perform in the midterms. In 1994,
2010 and 2018 \-- all years when Congress\' approval rating was between
21% and 23% and the president\'s party was in the majority \-- the
incumbent party lost between 40 and 63 House seats. In 2014, even with
approval of Congress at 20%, the Democratic Party lost only 13 seats \--
again explained by Democrats\' weak starting position that year when
House Republicans were in the majority. In years when congressional
approval was significantly higher, the president\'s party suffered
minimal losses or even gained seats. Americans\' satisfaction with the
way things are going in the U.S. is also on pace to be the worst it has
been in a midterm election year. The 16% currently satisfied is six
points lower than the prior midterm low \-- 22% in 2010. Satisfaction
relates to midterm House seat loss in a similar way as the job approval
variables, with greater losses tending to happen in elections when
satisfaction is low \-- such as in 1982 (24%), 1994 (30%) and 2010 (22%)
\-- and more minimal losses or gains for the president\'s party in years
when satisfaction is high, including 1986 (58%), 1998 (60%) and 2002
(48%). Gallup has a shorter history of measuring Americans\' perceptions
of current U.S. economic conditions, dating back to the early 1990s.
Since that time, Americans\' views of the economy during midterm
election years have only ever been similarly bad as now once before \--
in 2010, when net ratings of economic conditions were -31. Economic
ratings tend to be less strongly related to midterm election outcomes
than other mood indicators are, though views of the economy certainly
influence how Americans rate the job that political leaders are doing
and whether they are satisfied with the way things are going in the
country. Positive evaluations of the economy in 2006 and 2018 were not
enough to overcome weak job approval ratings for Presidents Bush and
Trump, respectively, and for Congress, suggesting political leaders were
being evaluated on factors besides the economy. But even if the economy
is less correlated with midterm election outcomes, the fact that
Americans view it negatively this year is just one more issue that does
not reflect favorably on the governing Democratic Party. Vote choices in
elections are strongly tied to a voter\'s political leanings. Party
affiliation has been a good indicator of midterm election outcomes in
the past because it either related to the partisanship of the electorate
or was a harbinger of **[how]{.underline}** people would vote. On
average over the past three months, Americans have been equally likely
to identify politically as Republicans or say they are independents who
lean toward the Republican Party (45%) as to identify as Democrats or to
lean Democratic (45%). While the parties appear, then, to be on equal
footing heading into the midterms, the figures are generally a better
sign for the Republican Party than the Democratic Party for two key
reasons: First, historically, Democrats usually have an advantage on
this measure of party affiliation. For example,
in [2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/388781/political-party-preferences-shifted-greatly-during-2021.aspx),
Democrats had a three-point advantage (though the numbers varied greatly
over the course of the year), which is typical. Second, Republican
voters usually turn out at higher rates than Democratic voters do. If
usual turnout patterns hold, and partisanship among all national adults
is even, then the electorate will have more Republican identifiers and
leaners than Democratic ones. There were also even splits in party
affiliation in 1994, 2002, 2010, 2014 and 2018 election years, and all
but one were good years for Republican candidates. The major exception
was 2018, a year in which the parties were fairly evenly matched but
Democrats did better in the elections, perhaps because of Trump\'s
unpopularity and the [unusually high
turnout](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/19/18103110/2018-midterm-elections-turnout?utm_source=link_newsv9&utm_campaign=item_393626&utm_medium=copy) that
year. By contrast, in years when the Democratic Party had sizable
advantages on party identification, like in 1998 and 2006, Democrats
picked up seats in Congress. At the same time, the relatively slim
majority enjoyed by House Democrats should shield the party from losses
in the upper range of what\'s possible when presidential approval is in
the low 40s and less than a quarter of Americans are satisfied with the
state of the nation. While it is unclear whether policy issues can
eclipse presidential performance or the national mood as midterm
election voting factors, **[Democrats may benefit politically from the
Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and Republican opposition to gun
control measures in the wake of a series of mass
shootings.]{.underline}** Recent Gallup data suggest abortion will be [a
more important voting
factor](https://news.gallup.com/poll/393263/abortion-poised-bigger-voting-issue-past.aspx) this
year than it usually is in U.S. elections, more so among those who
support rather than oppose legalized abortion. Also, even before the
mass shootings, the majority of Americans expressed dissatisfaction
with [U.S. gun
laws](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/393092/americans-recent-attitudes-toward-guns.aspx) and
favored enacting stricter laws. On the other hand, further increases in
gas prices or renewed focus on the border crisis could compound
Democrats\' problems in November. **[Regardless of what issues might
drive voter behavior, unless Americans\' opinions of the job Biden is
doing and the state of the nation improve over the next five months, the
Democratic Party may face a situation similar to 1994 and 2010 when it
suffered major losses in its presidents\' first midterms but regrouped
in time to win the presidential election two years later.]{.underline}**

#### Republicans Are Favored to Win The House,

AC

- 

Republicans are substantial favorites to take over the U.S. House of
Representatives following this November's midterm elections, but the
U.S. Senate is much more competitive, according to [FiveThirtyEight's
2022 midterm election
forecast](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/),
which launched today. Democrats are also favored to hang on to the
governorships in a trio of swing states in the Rust Belt ---
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan --- although they are significant
underdogs to win high-profile gubernatorial races in Georgia and Texas
against Republican incumbents.

The split diagnosis reflects the difference between macro- and
micro-level conditions. [The national environment is quite poor for
Democrats. Of course, this is typical for the [president's party, which
has lost seats in the House in [all but two of the past 21 midterm
elections](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/seats-congress-gainedlost-the-presidents-party-mid-term-elections)]{.mark}.]{.underline}
But Democrats are also saddled with [an unpopular President
Biden](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/) and
a series of challenges for the country, including inflation levels that
haven't been seen in decades, [the [lingering effects of the
still-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and [fraying trust in civic
institutions](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democratic-values-are-still-under-attack-even-without-trump-in-the-white-house/)]{.mark}
--- caused, in part, [by [Republican efforts to overturn the results of
the 2022
election](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/28/us/jan-6-hearing-today)]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Democrats, as a [predominantly urban
party](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-in-blue-cities-are-increasingly-outliers/),
also face a longstanding problem in the Senate, where every state has
equal representation regardless of its population, [resulting in a
[substantial built-in bias toward white, rural
states](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senates-rural-skew-makes-it-very-hard-for-democrats-to-win-the-supreme-court/).
And although [Democrats are [very slightly better off following the
redistricting process in the
House](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/)]{.mark}
than they were under the 2020 maps, there are [still more
Republican-leaning seats than Democratic-leaning
ones.]{.mark}]{.underline} True, the political environment is dynamic.
The Supreme Court's [decision last week to overturn Roe v.
Wade](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roe-v-wade-defined-an-era-the-supreme-court-just-started-a-new-one/)
is too recent to be fully reflected in polls, but there are reasons to
think it will help Democrats. Roe, which granted the constitutional
right to abortion, [was a popular
precedent](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/06/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-despite-public-opinion/),
and Democratic voters are [more likely than Republican
ones](https://thehill.com/homenews/3537982-democrats-more-likely-to-vote-in-midterms-after-abortion-ruling-poll/)
to say the decision will encourage them to vote at the midterms.
Moreover, in [striking down Roe and [other popular
laws](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/04/20/amid-a-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-u-s-gun-policy-remains-deeply-divisive/)
like [restrictions against the concealed carry of
firearms](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-supreme-courts-gun-ruling-means-for-gun-control/),
the [Supreme Court has in some ways undermined one of the traditional
reasons]{.mark} that [the president's party tends to lose seats]{.mark}
at [the midterms]{.mark}.]{.underline} Typically, voters like some
degree of balance: They do not want one party to have unfettered control
of all levers of government. But the Supreme Court, with its 6-3
conservative majority, is a reminder of how much power Republicans have
even if they don't control the White House. The insurrection at the U.S.
Capitol on Jan. 6 can also serve as a reminder to voters about what
might happen if the Electoral College certification process takes place
in 2024 amid Republican control of both chambers of
Congress.[^1^](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/#fn-1)
Democrats have [had trouble getting the public to treat threats to
democracy as a high
priority](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-moving-on-from-jan-6-even-if-congress-hasnt/),
but polls do show that the [public is sympathetic to the Democrats'
case](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/06/23/what-are-americans-thinking-about-the-january-6-hearings/),
especially after the recent congressional hearings on the events of Jan.
6. So, this is not a typical, low-stakes midterm election. On the
contrary, there are strong forces tugging at each side of the rope, some
of which are potentially of existential importance. But [Democrats'
majorities in both chambers of Congress are narrow,]{.mark} the
[historical precedent toward the president's party losing seats is
strong,]{.mark} and [polls so far --- such as the [generic congressional
ballot](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/),
which asks voters which party they would support in an election ---
suggest that voters]{.mark} slightly [prefer Republican control of
Congress.]{.mark} Or at least that's the story in the House, where there
are dozens of competitive races and candidates are relatively anonymous.
There, big-picture factors tend to prevail. An unusually weak Republican
candidate in one district might be counteracted by a strong one in
another, for example. [[In the Senate and gubernatorial races, by
contrast, individual factors can matter more. And the GOP has nominated
--- or is poised to nominate --- candidates who might significantly
underperform a "generic"]{.underline}]{.mark} Republican based on dsome
combination of
[inexperience](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/19/pennsylvania-republicans-dr-oz-senate-bid-523023),
[personal
scandals](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/us/politics/herschel-walker-children.html)
or [having articulated unpopular conservative
positions](https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-gop-senate-candidate-masters-privatizing-social-security-2022-6).
This is not a new problem for Republicans: underqualified or fringy
candidates have [cost them seats in the Senate in other recent
cycles](https://www.politico.com/story/2012/08/akin-legitimate-rape-victims-dont-get-pregnant-079864).
So let's briefly run through the model's forecast for House, Senate and
gubernatorial races. Then I'll describe some changes to the model since
2020 --- which are modest this year but reflect how congressional races
are changing in an increasingly polarized political environment. **The
House** [[Republicans have [an 87 percent chance of taking over the
House](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house),
according to the Deluxe version of our model.]{.underline} That's far
from certain,]{.mark} [[but Democrats are fighting the odds: Their 13
percent chances are equivalent to tossing a coin and having it come up
tails three times in a row.]{.mark}]{.underline} That's not to say House
control will be a matter of luck, exactly. A change in the political
environment could have ripple effects. For instance, sometimes one party
wins nearly all the toss-up races, as [Republicans did in
2020](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-house.html).
However, even if Democrats were to win all 13 races that our model
currently designates as "toss-ups" (meaning that no party has more than
a 60 percent chance of winning), plus hold on to all the seats in which
they're favored, they would still wind up with only 208 seats, 10 short
of the number they need for a majority. Instead, [[Democrats will also
have to win some seats where Republican candidates are currently
favored, and that requires the national political environment in
November to be more favorable for Democrats than our model is currently
expecting.]{.mark}]{.underline} On the one hand, the task isn't *that*
daunting for Democrats. Our model calculates that Democrats would be
favored to keep the House if they win the House popular vote --- or lose
it by less than 0.7 percentage points --- something that Democrats did
in both 2018 and 2020. Moreover, Democrats are down by only about 2
points in our [current average of generic-ballot
polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/).
Given the inherent error in polling, and how much time there is between
now and November, it isn't hard to turn a 2-point deficit in the polls
into a 1-point win. However, in important ways, that 2-point deficit
understates the degree of trouble that Democrats are in. One reason is
because many of those polls are conducted among registered voters rather
than likely voters, and the electorate that turns out in November is
likely to be more Republican than the broader universe of all registered
voters. Historically, the patterns in midterm elections are that: [[1)
Republicans turn out more than Democrats, and 2) voters for whichever
party doesn't control the presidency are more enthusiastic and turn out
more. In 2018, those factors canceled one another
out]{.underline}.]{.mark} Democrats, not controlling the presidency,
were the more enthusiastic party, helping to neutralize the Republicans'
historical turnout advantage. This year, though, they both work in the
favor of Republicans. Thus, the model adjusts those registered-voter
polls based on its estimate of what likely-voter polls would show, and
when it does that, the Republicans' generic-ballot lead is really more
like 4 points than 2 points. I should note that this adjustment is not
rigid in the model. Although the model uses historical turnout patterns
as its baseline assumption, it will override that based on polls. In
other words, if polls come out showing Democrats holding their own among
likely voters --- such as because of increased Democratic enthusiasm in
the wake of Roe being overturned --- the model will adjust to reflect
that. Put another way, a very strong turnout would give Democrats a
fighting chance of keeping the House. But also, the generic ballot isn't
the only input that the model considers, and some of the other factors
look worse for Democrats than the generic ballot does. Based on the
historical tendency for the president's party to lose seats in the
midterms and Biden's poor approval rating, for instance, the situation
is more likely to get worse for Democrats than better. The model also
evaluates factors such as polling and fundraising data in individual
races. Overall, the Deluxe forecast expects [[Democrats to eventually
lose the popular vote for the House by closer to 6 points, about the
margin that they lost it by in
[2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections).
And it expects Republicans to wind up with 237 seats in an average
outcome, a gain of 24 seats from the 213 they had at the start of the
current
Congress.[^2^](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/#fn-2)]{.underline}]{.mark}

When House Democrats are asked how they feel about their chances to keep
the majority, the answer often is a sigh or a groan. As the party in the
White House, the historical odds have not been in Democrats' favor ---
and that was before President Biden's approval ratings took a tumble,
inflation permeated the economy, and a war broke out in Ukraine. "The
problem is not the voters," he added. "The problem is us." Republicans
need a net gain of just five seats to retake the House majority. [[The

Dave Wasserman predicts that number will jump after New Hampshire and

Republican-held seats are toss-ups or leaning to the Democrats.

Democratic "blue wave" of primarily first-time female candidates [washed
away](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/midterm-elections-democrats-flip-house-as-gop-expands-senate-majority/2018/11/07/94d62430-e27d-11e8-8f5f-a55347f48762_story.html?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template)
their House majority thanks to high turnout by suburban women rebelling
against President Donald Trump and his party's efforts to repeal the
Affordable Care Act. In 2020, Republicans flipped 15 Democratic-held
seats, including 11 with female candidates, by

female candidates and by labeling their Democratic opponents as far-left
"socialists" who wanted to "defund the police" and favored open borders.
[[Republicans hope to replicate that success this year by focusing on

Vulnerable Democrats have also been instructed by party leaders to
confront attacks like "socialism" and "defund the police" head on, even
though doing so may alienate liberals. Asked about being

Susan Wild, who is our representative who does this and that and the
other. It's going to be harder for the GOP to tag me as just being a
Pelosi puppet or that she's part of the Biden administration that's
screwing up everything." Knowing that they could lose the majority this
year, Democrats spent the past year urgently trying to pass Biden's
agenda. While they were able to inject trillions into the economy to
combat the pandemic and rebuild infrastructure, Democratic infighting
came to define the
[failure](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/18/biden-build-back-better-where/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template)
of "Build Back Better" at a time when voters are sick of political
toxicity. [[Republicans are trying to frame Democrats as the party of

  LW and JV 

[Democrats]{.underline} [are widely expected]{.underline} [to suffer
defeats]{.underline} in the upcoming 2022 midterm elections, with
Republicans aiming to retake the House of Representatives and the
Senate. [The serving president\'s party usually performs poorly during
midterms and while it seems likely President Joe Biden will see major
losses this November, it\'s not clear just how bad things will be for
the Democrats.]{.underline} [Polls suggest the Democrats are on course
for disappointment and that the party could potentially lose control of
both chambers of Congress]{.underline} and see newly empowered
Republican majorities stymying Biden\'s agenda in the run up to the next
presidential election. A GOP gain in either chamber would hamstring the
Biden administration, but the worst case scenario would see comfortable
Republican majorities in both chambers, potentially leading to a slew of
investigations and possibly even impeachment of the president. Losing
the Senate. [Poll tracker FiveThirtyEight\'s 2022 election forecast
rates the Senate as a toss up with 35 seats up for re-election. Fourteen
are currently held by Democrats and 21 by Republicans.]{.underline}
FiveThirtyEight gives [Republicans \[have\] an 80 percent chance of
holding between 47 and 54 seats]{.underline}. If that latter figure is
reached, it would represent a major defeat for Biden\'s party. [The
Senate is currently divided between 50 Republicans, 48 Democrats and two
independents who caucus with the Democrats.]{.underline} Vice President
Kamala Harris has had to use her casting vote on a number of occasions
and a single Democratic loss in the midterms would hand control to the
Republicans. FiveThirtyEight rates the Senate races in Arizona, Georgia,
Nevada and Pennsylvania as toss-ups[. If Republicans can win all four,
it would be a major loss for the Democrats. Three of those seats are
held by incumbent Democrats, while Republican Senator Pat Toomey of
Pennsylvania is retiring. However, it\'s highly unlikely that
Republicans could gain enough seats in November to secure a 60-vote,
filibuster proof majority.]{.underline} This means Democrats are likely
to deploy the filibuster if the GOP retakes the chamber. Nonetheless, a
Republican-led Senate could hold up Biden\'s judicial nominees and
potentially prevent him filling any vacant seats that might arise on the
U.S. Supreme Court, as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell did in
2016 when he was majority leader[. A new poll found that nearly 60
percent of Americans disapprove of the job President Joe Biden is doing
as president.]{.underline} Republicans are favored to win the House,
according to FiveThirtyEight, while Democrats currently hold 220 seats
to Republicans\' 210, with five seats vacant. [The poll tracker\'s
analysis gives Republicans an 80 percent chance of holding between 215
and 258 seats. If the larger figure proves accurate, that would be a
huge gain for the GOP, though it remains an outside
possibility.]{.underline} The single worst midterm loss of House seats
occurred in 2010 when Democrats lost 63 seats under then President
Barack Obama. However, Obama\'s party retained control of the Senate
until the 2014 midterms. [It seems likely that Republican gains this
year will be more modest but that the GOP will still win the House. That
will allow House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to become speaker for
the first time and possibly mean the end of Speaker Nancy Pelosi\'s
political career. FiveThirtyEight\'s generic congressional ballot shows
Republicans with 44.8 percent support to the Democrats\' 43.2 percent,
as of July 6 - a margin of just 1.7 percent. If Republicans retake the
House, recent reporting suggests they will launch a series of
investigations into the Biden administration.]{.underline} Those probes
could include the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, the business
dealings of Hunter Biden and even an investigation into the House Select
Committee currently examining the events of January 6, 2021. Republican
investigations could dominate the political agenda heading into the 2024
presidential election. Democrats may also be concerned about potential
impeachment charges against President Biden, as some Republicans have
previously suggested. An impeachment push could center on the withdrawal
from Afghanistan or accusations relating to Biden\'s involvement in his
son\'s business. He has denied any involvement with Hunter Biden\'s
foreign business affairs. If the GOP controls both the House and Senate,
investigations could multiply and the possibility of impeachment could
be even greater. Losses in the midterms will prove disappointing for
Democrats and politically difficult for Biden, but Thomas Gift, founding
director of University College London\'s Centre on U.S. Politics, told
Newsweek the president\'s party may have even bigger problems. \"For
Democrats, the worst case scenario isn\'t just that they lose big in
November. It\'s that they lose big---and learn the wrong lessons about
why they got beat,\" Gift said. \"There\'s a certain faction within the
Democratic Party that will argue that its looming defeats in the
midterms are the result of not leaning hard enough into the progressive
agenda. That\'s not just wrong. It\'s delusional,\" he said. Gift said
that data showed centrist positions \"poll well with American voters.
Far-left positions don\'t.\" \"If Democrats continue to embrace policies
that most voters perceive as unacceptably liberal, 2022 will only be the
harbinger of more losses in 2024,\" he said. \"The sooner Democrats
realize that what earns likes on Twitter doesn\'t earn votes in swing
states, the sooner they\'ll figure out what it takes to beat the
eminently beatable Republican Party,\" Gift added.

Sweden and Ukraine see the alliance positively (63% and 53%,
respectively), but only 16% of Russians say the same. A map showing NATO
seen favorably in member states, but few in Turkey agree Favorable views
of the organization have fluctuated over time among both NATO member and
nonmember countries. Since the late 2000s, favorable opinions of NATO
are up 10 percentage points or more in Ukraine, Lithuania and Poland.
However, positive opinions of NATO are down significantly in Bulgaria,
Russia, Germany and France over the past decade, with double-digit
percentage point declines in each of these countries. Favorable views of
the organization are also down significantly in Spain and the Czech
Republic. A chart showing views of NATO have changed in both member
countries and among non-NATO members over past decade In addition,
across several countries surveyed, favorable views of the organization
are related to ideological orientation, with those on the right sharing
a more positive view than those on the ideological left. NATO serves as
a political and military alliance for its 29 member states spanning
Europe and North America. Founded in 1949 to provide collective defense
against the Soviet Union, the alliance seeks to balance Russian power
and influence, in addition to a host of other operations. A chart
showing NATO publics more likely to believe U.S. would defend them from
Russian attack than to say their own country should Despite the
organization's largely favorable ratings among member states, there is
widespread reluctance to fulfill the collective defense commitment
outlined in Article 5 of NATO's founding treaty. When asked if their
country should defend a fellow NATO ally against a potential attack from
Russia, a median of 50% across 16 NATO member states say their country
should not defend an ally, compared with 38% who say their country
should defend an ally against a Russian attack. Publics are more
convinced that the U.S. would use military force to defend a NATO ally
from Russia. A median of 60% say the U.S. would defend an ally against
Russia, while just 29% say the U.S. would not do so. And in most NATO
member countries surveyed, publics are more likely to say the U.S. would
defend a NATO ally from a Russian attack than say their own country
should do the same. In terms of transatlantic relations, some Western
European publics prefer a close relationship with the U.S., but many
others prefer a close relationship with both the U.S. and Russia.
Nevertheless, few want to prioritize their relationship with Russia over
their U.S. relations. Ideology also relates to views of potential
allies: Those on the right in several countries are more likely than
those on the left to prefer a relationship with the U.S. Despite the
reservations many have about NATO's Article 5 commitments, half or more
in nearly every country surveyed agree it is sometimes necessary to use
military force to maintain order in the world. In most countries
surveyed, those who say military force is sometimes necessary are also
more likely to agree that their country should use military force to
defend a fellow NATO ally. These views have changed significantly over
the past decade in some countries. In Ukraine, Russia, Slovakia and
Germany, more say military force is sometimes necessary than said the
same in 2007. And in Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic, publics have
grown less inclined to agree. On the topic of territorial ambitions,
when asked if there are parts of neighboring countries that really
belong to their country, relatively few surveyed agree. However, among
NATO member states, majorities in Hungary, Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria
agree that parts of other countries belong to them. In many European
countries, those with a favorable view of right-wing populist parties
are more likely to support this statement. These are among the key
findings from a Pew Research Center survey of 19 countries, including 16
NATO member states, Sweden, Russia and Ukraine. The survey was conducted
among 21,029 people from May 13 to Aug. 12, 2019. Throughout this
report, German results are occasionally sourced from a series of surveys
conducted in Germany by Körber-Stiftung, in partnership with Pew
Research Center. NATO viewed favorably across member states, though
opinions have shifted over time A chart showing views of NATO Across the
16 NATO member countries surveyed, NATO is generally seen in a positive
light. A median of 53% across these countries have a favorable view of
the organization, while a median of 27% have an unfavorable opinion. In
13 of these countries, roughly half or more have a positive view of
NATO. Among NATO member countries, positive views of the organization
range from 82% in Poland to 21% in Turkey. Majorities of people in
Poland, Lithuania, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany
rate NATO positively in Europe. Opinions are also relatively positive in
the Czech Republic, Slovakia, France, Spain, Hungary and Bulgaria.
Canadians and Americans hold positive views of NATO, with 66% in Canada
and 52% in the U.S. expressing favorable opinions. In Turkey and Greece,
publics are particularly unfavorable toward the alliance: Roughly half
or more express a negative opinion. Among the three non-NATO countries
surveyed, views of the alliance are mixed. In Sweden and Ukraine, more
than half have a favorable view of NATO. But in Russia, 60% have an
unfavorable view of the organization, while just 16% view it favorably,
the smallest share across all countries surveyed. Views of NATO have
fluctuated since Pew Research Center began asking this question in 2007.
In non-NATO-member Ukraine, for example, 34% said they had a favorable
view of the organization in 2007. In 2019, 53% said the same, an
increase of 19 percentage points. Lithuanians and Poles have also grown
more favorable toward NATO over the past 10 to 12 years (increases of 18
and 10 points, respectively). Several countries have soured on the
alliance over that period. In France, favorable views of NATO dropped
from 71% in 2009 to 49% in 2019, a decrease of 22 percentage points. In
Germany, favorable views of the organization declined by 16 points, and
in Bulgaria favorable views are down by 12 points. In nonmember Russia,
positive views have been nearly cut in half: In 2007, 30% had a
favorable view of NATO. By 2019, just 16% expressed the same sentiment.
A table showing NATO favorability over time In U.S., views of NATO
differ among Democrats and Republicans Americans' views of NATO differ
by political party affiliation. Democrats and Democratic-leaning
independents have been more likely to have a favorable opinion of NATO
than Republicans and Republican-leaning independents across most years.
That remained true in 2019, as 61% of Democrats had a positive view of
the alliance, compared with 45% of Republicans. A chart showing
Democrats consistently more favorable toward NATO than Republicans Both
Democratic and Republican views of NATO remained generally stable until
2017, when Democrats grew much more likely to support NATO than their
counterparts, a difference that has not changed significantly since. In
2017, 74% of Democrats and 48% of Republicans had a favorable opinion of
the alliance, a difference of 26 percentage points. Since 2018, U.S.
views of NATO have declined among supporters of both parties. Positive
views among Democrats fell 15 points, while views among Republicans
dropped 7 points. Those on the right tend to have a more positive view
of NATO A chart showing those on the ideological right more favorable
toward NATO Ideology is a factor when it comes to views of NATO in
several countries. In six countries, those placing themselves on the
right side of the ideological spectrum are more favorable toward NATO
than those on the left. In Sweden, for example, 79% of those on the
ideological right have a positive opinion of NATO, compared with 38% of
those on the left, a difference of 41 percentage points. Significant
differences between those on the right and the left are also seen in
Bulgaria (38 percentage points), the Czech Republic (36 points), Spain
(25), Greece (19) and Slovakia (16). Public reluctance on Article 5
obligations across NATO member countries A chart showing publics in NATO
countries express reluctance on Article 5 obligations Article 5 of the
NATO treaty is "at the very heart of NATO's founding treaty," according
to the organization. The article states that "an attack against one Ally
is considered as an attack against all Allies." When asked whether their
country should or should not use military force to defend a NATO ally
from a hypothetical attack by Russia, in only five of the 16 member
states surveyed -- the Netherlands, the U.S., Canada, the UK and
Lithuania -- do half or more say that they should use such force. Across
the 16 countries, a median of 50% say that their country should not
defend a NATO ally in the event of an attack by Russia, while 38% say
they should. Larger shares in 10 NATO member countries surveyed say
their country should not use force to defend a NATO ally should there be
an attack by Russia. This includes majorities in Bulgaria, Italy,
Greece, Germany and Spain. In Poland, sentiment is divided. A chart
showing changing views on whether their country should intervene in a
conflict between Russia and a NATO ally The belief that their country
should respond to a hypothetical Russian attack on a NATO ally has
become less common over time in a handful of countries. For example, in
Italy, only a quarter in 2019 say that their country should defend a
NATO ally, down from four-in-ten in 2015. Similar declines over this
time period occurred in Poland (-8 percentage points), Spain (-7) and
France (-6). However, support for protecting a fellow NATO nation has
increased in the UK since 2015 (+6). In eight of the countries polled,
men are significantly more likely than women to say that their country
should defend a NATO ally. For example, in Germany, 43% of men say that
in the case of a Russian attack on a fellow NATO member their country
should respond with force, compared with only a quarter of women.
Similar double-digit differences occur in Spain, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, the Netherlands and Poland. Ideology also plays a role in
people's views about coming to an ally's aid. In six countries, those
who place themselves on the right end of the ideological spectrum are
more willing to say they should defend a NATO ally than those on the
right. This includes double-digit differences between right and left in
all six countries: Spain (30 percentage points), the Czech Republic and
Slovakia (21 points), Greece (14), and the UK and Italy (both 13
points). A table showing those who agree military force is sometimes
necessary are more likely to support defending a NATO ally Views on
defending an ally from a potential Russian attack are related to general
attitudes toward the use of military force. Across most of the NATO
member countries surveyed, those who agree that military force is
sometimes necessary to maintain order in the world are more likely to
say that they would defend a fellow NATO member from an armed incursion
than those who disagree that a military solution is the best choice for
keeping order. For example, in Spain, 53% of those who agree that
military force is sometimes necessary say they would come to the aid of
a NATO ally, versus only 26% of those who disagree with the principle of
military force -- a 27 percentage point difference. A chart showing
people in member states say the U.S. would defend a NATO ally In
contrast to skeptical opinions on whether their own country should come
to the defense of a NATO ally, people are much more likely to think the
U.S. would take military action in response to a Russian attack. A
median of 60% across the member countries say the U.S. would use
military force to defend a NATO country that was subject to a Russian
incursion. Only 29% across these countries believe the U.S. would not
defend the country that was attacked. Roughly two-thirds or more in
Italy, the UK, Spain, Canada, the Netherlands and Greece say the U.S.
would defend a NATO ally. Majorities in Germany, Slovakia, Lithuania and
France agree. Poles, on balance, say the U.S. would help out should
Russia use military force against a neighboring NATO country, but
sentiment is more divided in Turkey, the Czech Republic and Hungary.
Since 2015, there has been some change in a few countries on this
question. The belief that the U.S. would defend a NATO ally is down 8
percentage points in France but up 7 points in the UK and Spain. These
sentiments are also up 6 points in Turkey. In Hungary, views that the
U.S. would help out in the event of a Russia attack are down
significantly since 2017, falling 16 percentage points. A table showing
more in NATO countries say the U.S. would use military force to defend
an ally from Russia than say that their country should do the same Young
adults in Spain, France, Slovakia, Canada and Germany are more likely to
believe the U.S. would defend a NATO ally against a Russian attack. For
example, in Spain, 84% of 18- to 29-year-olds say the U.S. would uphold
their Article 5 obligations, compared with 68% of those 50 and older. In
almost every country surveyed, people are significantly more likely to
say the U.S. would defend an ally from a Russia attack than say their
own country should take such action. The biggest difference measured is
in Italy, where three-quarters say the U.S. would use such military
force in such a scenario, compared with only a quarter who say Italy
should defend that NATO ally, a 50 percentage point difference. Similar
differences are seen in Greece (40 points), Spain (31), Germany (29),
Slovakia (25), the UK (18), France (16), Turkey (14) and Canada (13).
Many NATO countries in Europe value a close relationship with both the
U.S. and Russia A chart showing western Europeans favor close
relationship with U.S. over Russia; Central and Eastern Europeans tend
to prefer both In nearly every country surveyed, larger shares support
close ties with the U.S. than with Russia, with the exceptions of
Bulgaria and Slovakia. And in many countries polled, publics tend to
volunteer that a close relationship with both the U.S. and Russia is
important. Particularly in Western Europe, the share of the public that
says a relationship with the U.S. is more important is substantial. For
example, in the UK and the Netherlands, about eight-in-ten support ties
with the U.S. over Russia or both. And in Sweden, a non-NATO state, 71%
support closer ties with the U.S. than with Russia (11%) or both
countries (9%). Choosing a close relationship with Russia over the U.S.
is considerably less widespread across the countries surveyed.
Bulgarians are the most prone to this point of view, but just 28% say a
close relationship with Russia is more important for their country. A
quarter of Germans say it is important for their country to have a close
relationship with Russia, compared with 39% who favor a close
relationship with the U.S. Three-in-ten Germans volunteer that a close
relationship with both countries would be preferable. A chart showing
those on right ideologically more likely to favor close relationship
with U.S. Central and Eastern European publics tend to volunteer their
preference for a close relationship with both the U.S. and Russia. In
Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Bulgaria, roughly half or more say a
relationship with both countries is important. And in Italy, Greece, the
Czech Republic and Lithuania, about four-in-ten or more say the same.
Ideology is linked to views of closer relations with the U.S. In 11 of
14 countries, those on the ideological right are more likely to support
a close relationship with the U.S. than those on the left. In the Czech
Republic, for example, 40% of those on the right say a close
relationship with the U.S. is more important, compared to 15% of those
on the left, a difference of 25 percentage points. Hungary is an
exception. Hungarians on the left (40%) are almost twice as likely as
their counterparts on the right (21%) to support close U.S. relations.
Most NATO and non-NATO countries believe military force is sometimes
necessary A chart showing across most of Europe and North America,
support for military force to maintain order in the world There is
widespread support across most of the NATO countries surveyed for the
use of military force to maintain order in the world. A median of 57%
across 16 member countries agree that military force is sometimes
necessary, while a median of 36% disagree. Across most countries
surveyed -- both members of NATO and those that do not belong to the
organization -- about half or more support the use of military force to
maintain order. And in seven countries (Sweden, the U.S., Canada, the
UK, Turkey, Russia and Hungary) seven-in-ten or more hold this view.
Germans are more divided, with 47% saying that military force is
sometimes necessary and a similar 52% disagreeing with that statement.
In Bulgaria, only 38% say military force is sometimes necessary. A table
showing views of military force have changed across several countries
Support for military force has changed since Pew Research Center asked
this question in 2007. For example, in both Ukraine and Russia, two
countries engaged in conflict since 2014, publics increasingly say
military force is sometimes necessary (by 11 and 9 percentage points,
respectively). This opinion has also become more common in Slovakia and
Germany. Yet in several European countries, support for military force
has waned. This is the case in Italy (a decrease of 21 percentage
points), Spain (10 points) and the Czech Republic (9). A chart showing
those on the right more likely to say military force can be necessary to
maintain order In 12 countries, people on the right of the ideological
spectrum are more apt than those on the left to agree that military
force can be justified. In Spain, for example, those on the right are
about twice as likely to support military force as their counterparts on
the left. In the U.S., conservatives are 25 percentage points more
likely than liberals to say military force is sometimes needed.
Similarly, 91% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say
military force is sometimes necessary, while 71% of Democrats and
Democratic-leaning independents agree. Gender also shapes views of
military action. Across most of the NATO and non-NATO countries
surveyed, men are more likely than women believe in the need for
military force. In the Czech Republic, for example, 63% of men say
military force is sometimes necessary, compared with 45% of women. And
in Ukraine, 71% of men support military force, versus 56% of women.
Double-digit gender differences are also present in Germany (14 points),
Poland (12), Bulgaria (12), Hungary (11), Italy (11) and Spain (10). Are
there parts of neighboring countries that really belong to us? A chart
showing Europeans divided over whether parts of neighboring countries
belong to them Across NATO and non-NATO countries, there is disagreement
over whether parts of neighboring countries really belong to them. A
median of 45% across the 16 NATO countries surveyed disagree, while a
median of 35% agree (in several countries, the share who did not express
an opinion is relatively high). The shares who agree with this statement
are highest in Central and Eastern European countries surveyed. About
two-thirds of Hungarians (67%) agree that parts of neighboring countries
belong to them, including 40% who completely agree. In Turkey, 58% agree
that parts of nearby countries belong to them. And in neighboring
Greece, 60% say the same. In Western European countries, sentiments tend
to run in the opposite direction. In Sweden (82%), the Netherlands
(74%), the UK (72%), Germany (62%), Spain (60%) and France (59%),
majorities disagree that there are parts of other countries that belong
to them. In both the U.S. and Canada, publics overwhelmingly disagree
that parts of other countries belong to them (73% and 65%,
respectively). However, a quarter of Canadians and roughly one-in-five
Americans say the opposite and agree that there are parts of neighboring
countries that belong to them. Russians and Ukrainians tend to agree
that parts of neighboring countries belong to them (53% and 47%,
respectively). A table showing those with a favorable view of right-wing
populist parties more likely to say parts of other countries belong to
them In Europe, supporters of right-wing populist parties tend to be
more likely to say parts of neighboring countries belong to their
country. Supporters of right-wing populist parties are more likely to
agree with this statement for nearly every European right-wing populist
party included in the survey. In Spain, for example, those who have a
favorable view of Vox are 27 percentage points more likely to say parts
of another country belong to Spain than those who do not have a
favorable view of the party. Correction (February 12, 2020): This post

#### **[CYBER SECURITY POPULAR]{.underline}**

#### **Across the Political Spectrum, Americans Overwhelmingly View Cyber Security as one of Nation's Top Threats to Address** 

**Leffel**, Zachary.**6/7** Chicago Council on Global Affairs.
<https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/commentary-and-analysis/blogs/americans-recognize-cyber-threats-are-divided-best-response>
June 7, 2022

Over the course of the last year there have been a number of
high-profile cyberattacks, including government-sponsored and private
attacks on targets within the United States. More recently, Russia has
brought the topic of cybersecurity to the forefront by engaging in
repeated hacking of Ukrainian government and civilian systems in
coordination with their conventional military attack on the country.
**[[Americans across the partisan spectrum agree that cyberattacks are a
critical threat to the interests of the United
States]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, since cyber warfare is a
relatively new and rapidly developing concept, there are not yet clear
norms determining how it fits into the escalatory ladder of conventional
warfare. For their part, the American public seems to view cyberattacks
as warranting an in-kind response, but not as cause for launching a
conventional military attack. **[[Americans View Cyberattacks as a Top
Security]{.underline}]{.mark}** Threat. Public opinion polling shows a
[lack of consensus about where cyberattacks fall within the escalatory
ladder of conventional warfare. Over the course of the last year there
have been a number of high-profile cyberattacks, including
government-sponsored and private attacks on targets within the United
States. More recently, Russia has brought the topic of cybersecurity to
the forefront by engaging in repeated hacking of Ukrainian government
and civilian systems in coordination with their conventional military
attack on the country]{.underline}. Over the past decade, international
confrontations in cyberspace have increased in both frequency and
intensity. In general, public opinion has tracked along with this
dynamic. **[[In 2010 just over half of the public (53 percent) saw
cyberattacks as a critical threat. In the Council's March 25--28 survey,
that figure rose to 73 percent, making cyberattacks one of the top
threats in the eyes of Americans. This position is popular across party
lines---held by more than seven in 10 Republicans (77 percent critical
threat), Democrats (71 percent),]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Independents
(73 percent). **[[Along with this widespread concern over cyberattacks,
four in five Americans see preventing cyberattacks as a very important
US foreign policy goal (83 percent)]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

According to a Council survey from 2017, concerns about cyberattacks are
primarily focused on the possible effects on US infrastructure.
Americans expressed more concern about damage to US infrastructure (43
percent) than the theft of personal information (34 percent) or
classified government information (22 percent). Both recent events and
expert forecasts about cyber vulnerability indicate that these concerns
about American infrastructure are likely valid. A May 2021 cyberattack
on the Colonial Pipeline resulted in a massive shutdown of gasoline
transport on the East Coast of the United States and certainly caught
the attention of the American public. According to a poll by YouGov
America, 85 percent of Americans were aware of the attack a week later.
Fighting Virtual Fire with Fire As international actors' cyber
capabilities evolve, how cyber warfare fits into countries' traditional
foreign policy toolboxes and strategies has remained somewhat of a gray
area. Debates surrounding how international law will be applied in
cyberspace and whether conventional military attacks are justified
responses to cybercrimes are certainly not closed ones, and countries
are already developing a range of different approaches. For their part,
the American public seems to support most retaliatory measures short of
conventional warfare in response to cyberattacks. These include imposing
sanctions on countries that have launched cyberattacks (85 percent) as
well as conducting retaliatory cyberattacks against governmental
computer systems (59 percent). However, Americans are reluctant to
escalate cyberwarfare into conventional warfare: only 41 percent support
responding to cyberattacks with airstrikes aimed at another country's
military. Public support is also low for retaliatory cyberattacks
targeting another country's civilian infrastructure (35 percent). Across
the board, Republicans display higher levels of support for retaliatory
actions. Gaps between Republicans and Democrats ranged from eight
percentage points on imposing sanctions to 13 points on airstrikes
against military targets. \"Bar graph\" What Does This Mean for Ukraine?
The above data on potential responses to cyberattacks are from July
2021, well before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia has been linked
to multiple cyberattacks against Ukraine's government infrastructure,
and the European Union has recently declared them responsible for an
attack on European satellite internet just before the invasion of
Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has brought international cyberwarfare
squarely into the public focus, and recent polling is beginning to tease
out how Americans see cyberwarfare fitting into the broader US response
to the invasion. A YouGov survey fielded April 30--May 3 finds that
Americans are conflicted about launching cyberattacks on Russia as a
response to in the country's invasion of Ukraine. Just over a third of
Americans think that launching cyberattacks is a good idea (38 percent),
while another third say it is a bad idea (33 percent), and the final
third is unsure (29 percent). The survey found a similar level of
support (35 percent) for sending soldiers to Ukraine solely to provide
help and not to fight Russian soldiers. A number of other proposed
responses to Russian aggression received higher support among the
American public. Over six in 10 support sending financial aid (65
percent) and weapons (62 percent) to Ukraine. Policies that fall cleanly
into the nonmilitary category, such as imposing economic sanctions on
Russia (68 percent) and banning Russian imports (60 percent) are also
more popular among the public. These differing levels of support
indicate Americans likely view cyberattacks as a significant escalation
from nonmilitary support for Ukraine, more on par in severity with
putting American troops on Ukrainian soil, but still short of full
military engagement. These findings specific to the current situation in
Ukraine are difficult to directly compare to the general cyberwarfare
questions above because of Russia's tense relationship with the United
States. **[[Responses may suggest an unwillingness by Americans to
directly involve the United States in a conflict with a powerful
adversary instead of being a statement on the norms of engaging in cyber
warfare. As Russia's war in Ukraine progresses, it may serve to shape
the norms and regulation of cyber warfare as a dimension of
international conflict.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[Sixty-two percent believe that artificial intelligence should be guided
by human values, while 21 percent do not and 17 percent are

percent of those aged 35 to 54 believe that, compared to only 59 percent
of those over the age of 65.

WHO SHOULD DECIDE ON AI DEPLOYMENT?

The survey asked who should decide on how AI systems are designed and
deployed. Nineteen percent name the general public, followed by 11
percent who say private company leaders, 9 percent who believe
legislators should decide, 7 percent who feel software coders should
make the decisions, and 4 percent who cite judges. Half of those
questioned are unsure who should make these decisions.

Who should decide AI deployment

But there are some small differences by gender and geography. For
example, men (14 percent) are more likely than women (8 percent) to want
private company leaders to make AI decisions. In addition, those from
the Northeast (14 percent) are more likely than those from the Midwest
(9 percent) to say they prefer private company leaders.

elections.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the aftermath of the 2016 election,
researchers found that the Russian influence operation specifically
attempted to dampen turnout of Black voters and found that they were
targeted with more Facebook ads than any group. [[The new measure would
specifically prohibit algorithmic processes that interfere with
individuals' voting rights]{.mark}.]{.underline} The bill comes as some
large tech companies have made changes under pressure to ensure their
products and services aren't abused in sensitive contexts, such as in
regards to housing or policing. For instance, as part of a 2019
settlement, Facebook agreed to block advertisers from targeting housing,
employment and credit ads based on age, gender and Zip code, which can
be used as a proxy for race. But lawmakers have continued to raise
concerns about such targeting in other categories, such as financial
services. People have repeatedly challenged tech companies' practices
under existing civil rights law, but Markey's new bill would ensure
there are specific rules on the books for digital platforms. Democrats
have proposed other measures that take aim at these concerns. Rep.
Yvette D. Clarke (D-N.Y.) has proposed changes to Section 230, a key
Internet legal shield, to target discriminatory advertising. The
legislation comes as lawmakers are increasingly showing an interest in
focusing on algorithms and transparency[. [Following years of debate
about how to regulate social media companies]{.mark},
la]{.underline}wmakers from both political parties are now interested in
advancing legislation to force greater transparency about the content
moderation practices and algorithms that power major tech platforms. The
Senate Judiciary Committee recently hosted a hearing on algorithms and
amplification, where senators homed in on the ways the design of social
networks influences society. Markey and Matsui's proposal would also
require tech companies to publish annual reports detailing their content
moderation practices, something some large companies, including
Facebook, already do. The companies also would have to maintain detailed
records describing their algorithmic process for review by the FTC.
Companies generally very closely guard these processes because of
privacy and commercial concerns. Certain personal details would be
removed from those records to ensure privacy. Our top tabs Lawmakers

chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, called
on the Justice Department to investigate the \$8.45 billion deal, which
she said "has the potential to impact millions of consumers." The
barrage of criticism underscores the increased antitrust scrutiny of the
e-commerce giant amid broad backlash against tech giants in Washington.
House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee chair, Rep. David N.
Cicilline (D-R.I.), tweeted that the deal "reinforces what we already
know --- they are laser-focused on expanding and entrenching their
monopoly power. That's bad for workers, consumers, and small
businesses." Rep. Ken Buck (Colo.), the top Republican on the panel,
said he was "deeply concerned" by the deal. Rep. Pramila Jayapal
(D-Wash.), whose congressional district includes Amazon's corporate
headquarters, also criticized the deal and called for Congress to "work
quickly to rein in anti-competitive behavior." Jeff Bezos, Amazon\'s

The company says it will begin reducing the reach of posts made by users
who repeatedly share debunked content. The company, which already
reduces the reach of individual posts that have been fact-checked, has
been criticized for harboring influencers who repeatedly post baseless
information, including about the coronavirus and vaccinations. The new
policy does have some limitations, however. It will not apply to
[politicians]{.underline} whose posts are exempt from Facebook\'s
fact-checking policies, CNN correspondent Donie O'Sullivan noted. The
company has also begun to allow posts claiming that the coronavirus was
man-made, Politico's Cristiano Lima reports, as the U.S. intelligence
community looks into the theory that the source of the virus was a
laboratory in Wuhan, China. Google and a national hospital chain agreed
to work together to build algorithms with patient records. The goal of
the partnership is to develop algorithms that will boost efficiency at
hospitals, monitor patients and help doctors. (Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty

Google said the algorithms would boost the efficiency at hospitals, help
monitor patients and give doctors insights when making decisions, the
Wall Street Journal's Melanie Evans reports. The deal will further
entrench Google in the health-care sector, but raises new privacy and
competition concerns. HCA will remove personally identifiable
information from the records before they're shared with Google
engineers, according to an HCA executive who spoke with the Journal. But
Google\'s critics are wary of the deal, especially after the privacy
concerns with one of Google\'s previous health-care partnerships. From

called for Biden to issue an executive order on federal use of facial

technological safeguards and policy measures" rather than a ban on use
of the technology. In their letter to Biden, the groups also called on
the administration to boost funding of the National Institute of
Standards and Technology's Facial Recognition Vendor Test, and said
Biden should establish a National Artificial Intelligence Advisory

[More than half of [Americans are worried about Russia]{.mark}n
interference [in the 2022 midterm elections]{.mark}, according to a new
Reuters/Ipsos poll.]{.underline}

The poll released on Tuesday found that [52% of [Americans were worried
about Russian misinformation on the internet negatively affecting the
2022 midterm elections]{.mark}. The same percentage of Americans also
fear that Russia will send illicit financial support to some American
politicians.]{.underline}

[[American fear of Russia]{.mark}n interference in elections [has been
elevated]{.mark} since the 2016 presidential elections, when the Russian
organization, the Internet Research Agency, created thousands of fake
social media accounts to promote Russian political aims in the
elections. In a 2020 Pew survey, three-quarters of [Americans said they
thought it was somewhat or very likely that Russia or other foreign
governments would attempt to influence the]{.mark} 2020 [presidential
election]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The Reuters/Ipsos poll delved into several other American concerns,
regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its impact on Americans.
Sixty-nine percent of Americans said they were worried about fuel and
gas prices but 8 in 10 said that the United States should not buy oil or
gas from Russia during the conflict, even if it causes gas prices to
increase. Additionally, more than three quarters of Americans said both
that the United States should put further economic sanctions on Russia
and send weapons to Ukraine.

American perceptions of how President Joe Biden is handling Russia
remain virtually unchanged from last month -- 38% of Americans approved
of Biden's handling of the crisis in March and 38% approve in April. A
little over three-quarters of Americans said they were more likely to
support a candidate who helped Ukraine with military aid. Seventy-eight
percent said they were more likely to support a candidate who supports
Ukrainian refugees. A similar percentage -- 74% of Americans -- said
they favored the United States taking in refugees.

Happy Friday! Feel free to send us pranks or news tips on this April
Fools' Day, but please, specify which is which:
cristiano.lima@washpost.com. Below: A major Facebook ranking failure
exposes users to harmful posts, and two Amazon union votes are coming
down to the wire[. First: [**Democrats are calling on**
]{.mark}]{.underline}LinkedIn to [**[crack down on
misinformation]{.mark}**, too An unexpected tech platform is [facing new
pressure from Democrats]{.mark} [to step up its policies against
misinformation]{.mark}:]{.underline} LinkedIn. The Microsoft-owned
networking site is the latest major platform added to the Democratic
National Committee's misinformation scorecard, which for years has
graded platforms based on their rules against false or misleading
content. LinkedIn joins Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, TikTok,
Reddit and Snapchat as platforms Democrats are pressing to "take
responsibility for information quality on their sites," according to a
forthcoming announcement shared exclusively with The Technology 202.
Advertisement The platform is rarely discussed in the same vein as those
peers, largely due to its career and business [focus[. But it's still a
substantial source of news for American adults, and Democratic officials
say it deserves scrutiny, particularly when it comes to
misinformation]{.mark}. Concerns over tech companies' content moderation
practices are slowly extending to a wider pool of social networking
sites, even as larger platforms like Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and
Twitter remain the most common targets.]{.underline} The DNC's rubric
rates companies on a number of fronts, including whether their
algorithms surfaced "authoritative news" over "highly engaging news," if
they police rules against hate speech and incitement "consistently and
comprehensively," and whether they remove "[[maliciously manipulated
media and deepfakes]{.mark}." Advertisement In their latest update, the
DNC said that while the company fared well against its peers when it
came to its misinformation rules, the information they disclose about
their policies is lacking. "Our analysis suggests that [while the
company has strong policies in place to combat misinformation, its lack
of transparency makes it difficult to evaluate their
effectiveness]{.mark}," said Timothy Durigan, the top analyst for the
DNC's "Counter Disinformation Program."]{.underline} LinkedIn
spokesperson Greg Snapper said in a statement that the company has
\"strong policies and \[takes\] a number of proactive actions to protect
against the spread of misinformation,\" and that the platform will be
rolling out \"even greater transparency around how we action content
that doesn't belong in our community\" in coming weeks. Unlike other
platforms that restrict or prohibit specific types of misinformation,
such as posts about the covid-19 pandemic, LinkedIn's policies
explicitly tell users not to "share content in a way that you know is,
or think may be, misleading or inaccurate." Advertisement LinkedIn's
rules say that the platform "may prevent you from posting content from
sites that are known to produce or contain misinformation." They also
prohibit users from posting "misleading or deceptive information about
yourself," or engaging in "spam or scams." But the DNC knocked LinkedIn
in its report for providing "little transparency into how it ranks
content in feeds" and not making "public content or engagement data
available to researchers." LinkedIn holds a unique position among major
tech platforms: it's one of the most widely used social networks in the
United States, and yet much like its parent company, Microsoft, it has
faced little-to-no scrutiny in recent years from Washington. LinkedIn
founder Reid Hoffman, who sits on Microsoft's board, is also one of the
Democratic Party's most prominent megadonors --- a relative rarity among
prominent tech moguls, who have come under pressure in recent years to
remain largely apolitical. Advertisement While the platform is known
more for career updates and business news than politics and current
events, LinkedIn has faced its fair share of misinformation challenges[.
[In its sweeping report detailing Russian meddling online during the
2016 U.S. elections]{.mark}, the Senate Intelligence Committee wrote
that LinkedIn discovered activity on the platform linked to the
notorious Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency during the election
cycle. The panel noted that while the activity appeared to be "limited,"
LinkedIn is still "a significant target for foreign intelligence
services" because its users post "[significant personal and professional
data in pursuit of networking opportunities]{.mark}." "]{.underline}This
renders the platform a valuable source of information on an array of
sensitive intelligence targets --- including the identities of
government employees, active duty military personnel, cleared defense
contractors, and others," the panel wrote in its 2019 report.
Advertisement In 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that supporters
of the QAnon conspiracy theory "are increasingly going public on
LinkedIn, expanding their online presence and prompting the
professional-networking site to take steps to limit the spread of the
community." (A company spokesperson said at the time that "QAnon
misinformation is not tolerated on LinkedIn.") Later that year, my
colleagues Cat Zakrzewski and Rachel Lerman reported that "users shared
articles and videos that pushed false claims about the election results"
on the site. The scorecard may be a sign that more scrutiny is incoming.
Our top tabs Massive Facebook ranking flub exposed users to harmful
content for months "A group of Facebook engineers identified a 'massive
ranking failure' that exposed as much as half of all News Feed views to
'integrity risks' over the past six months," the Verge\'s Alex Heath
reports, citing a report obtained by the publication. Advertisement
According to the report: "Instead of suppressing dubious posts reviewed
by the company's network of outside fact-checkers, the News Feed was
instead giving the posts distribution, spiking views by as much as 30
percent globally. [Unable to find the root cause, the engineers watched
the surge subside a few weeks later and then flare up repeatedly until
the ranking issue was fixed on March 11th." The revelations are sure to
stoke the ire of lawmakers in Washington, who have long criticized the
platform over allegations it amplifies harmful material. Amazon union
vote too close to call early on A pair of union elections at Amazon
warehouses in Alabama and New York are too close to call after the first
day of voting, and their future will hinge on contested and uncounted
ballots, my colleagues Rachel Lerman and Gerrit De Vynck
report.]{.underline} Advertisement The dead heat so far is "keeping open
the potential for a historic turnaround in the efforts to unionize
workers at the e-commerce giant," Rachel and Gerrit report. They added,
"If either warehouse votes yes, it would result in the first successful
unionization effort at the nation's second largest private employer and
would generate major momentum for the labor movement there." Amazon did
not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amazon founder Jeff
Bezos owns The Washington Post. Treasury hits Russia\'s tech sector in
new sanctions The new sanctions "target parts of the Russian technology
sector that enable Moscow to acquire technology critical for its
military, including one firm that is Russia's largest microchip
producer," my colleague Jeff Stein reports. The Biden administration has
faced growing pressure to ratchet up its economic restrictions against
Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. The White House
previously targeted Russia's central banks and its technology imports,
and has banned Russian energy imports. Advertisement "We will continue

### INTERNAL LINK-Dem Win Bad

#### Conservative Radio falsely claim the Dems will cheat in midterms if they win, may insight Jan 6^th^ V2

**Thompson '22** \[Stuart A. Thompson, 7-5-2022, \"On Conservative
Radio, Misleading Message Is Clear: 'Democrats Cheat',\" No Publication,
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/05/business/media/conservative-radio-democrats-cheat.html\]

[November's midterm elections are still months away, but to many
conservative commentators, the fix is already in]{.underline}.
**[Democrats have cheated before, they say]{.underline}**, [and they
will cheat again. Never mind that the claims are false.]{.underline} In
Lafayette, La., Carol Ross, host of "The Ross Report," questioned how
Democrats could win a presidential election again after a tumultuous few
years in power. "They're going to have to cheat again," she said. "You
know that. There will be rampant cheating." In Greenville, S.C., Charlie
James, a host on 106.3 WORD, read from a blog post arguing that "the
Democrats are going to lose a majority during the midterm elections
unless they're able to cheat in a massive wide-scale way." And on WJFN
in Virginia, Stephen K. Bannon, the erstwhile adviser to [former
**President Donald J. Trump**]{.underline} who was indicted for refusing
to comply with subpoenas issued by the House committee investigating the
Jan. 6 Capitol riot**[, summed it up this way: "If Democrats don't
cheat, they don't win."]{.underline}** Mr. Trump introduced the nation
to a flurry of false claims about widespread voter fraud after his
electoral loss in 2020. The extent of his efforts has been outlined
extensively in the past couple of weeks during the hearings on the Jan.
6 Capitol riot --- including a speech that day in which he falsely said
Democrats changed voting laws "because they want to cheat."[Republican
politicians and cable outlets like Fox News have carried the torch for
Mr. Trump's conspiracy theories ever since. But the loudest and most
consistent booster of these unfounded claims has been talk radio, where
conservative hosts reduce the jumble of false voter fraud theories into
a two-word mantra: "Democrats cheat." ]{.underline}

[False Claims That 'Democrats Cheat']{.underline}

On radio shows around the country, hosts have claimed that Democrats
cheat to win elections, citing no evidence. Those claims have found new
traction as the midterm elections near.

- [KFAB-AM 1110 --- Omaha "These people are not going to sit by and just
  accept the big loss. They have the same poll numbers we do. What are
  they going to do? They\'re going to cheat."]{.underline}

- [KTRH-AM 740 --- Houston "The Democrats will hold on to the House and
  the Senate and the gubernatorial races, where they\'ll be able to
  cheat in the 2024 election. That's the plan."]{.underline}

- [WZFG-AM 1110 --- Fargo, N.D. "Now they're going to do everything they
  can to cheat in the election."]{.underline}

- [KEEL-AM 710 --- Shreveport, La. "They're going to get smoked so bad
  it's going to be embarrassing, if they can't cheat. They got to be
  able to cheat, and the way they got to do that is with mail-in
  ballots."]{.underline}

- [KTLK-AM 1130 --- Minneapolis "So they don\'t think they\'re going to
  be able to cheat to win in the same respects and in the same numbers
  that they did last time. Because they did last time."]{.underline}

- [WISN-AM 1130 --- Milwaukee "Half of following these Democrats around
  after elections is stomping out their new ways of cheating. No, you
  can\'t cheat that way --- no, you can\'t cheat that way."]{.underline}

[Mentions of "Democrats cheating" and similar ideas were raised more
than 5,000 times on syndicated radio shows and local broadcasts this
year]{.underline}, according to an analysis of data from Critical
Mention, a media monitoring service. Similar ideas were mentioned a few
hundred times on television shows and podcasts tracked by Critical
Mention during the same period.

Radio remains perhaps the most influential conduit for right-wing
thought, despite the rise of podcasts and social media. [Tens of
millions of people nationwide, especially older Americans and
blue-collar workers, listen to it regularly.\
Misinformation experts warn that talk **radio channels**, many of which
air political commentary 24 hours a day, **receive far too little
scrutiny compared with other mass media**.]{.underline} Talk radio is
also uniquely difficult to analyze and harder to moderate, because the
on-air musings from hosts usually disappear over the airwaves in an

**Cole, 7/9** \[7-9-2022, \"Trump lawyer says he will be reinstated as
president if GOP win midterms,\" Newsweek,
https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-lawyer-christina-bobb-rsbn-midterms-republicans-election-2020-1723145\]\
C[hristina Bobb, an attorney who has supported Donald Trump\'s legal
challenge to overturn the 2020 election, has suggested a scenario in
which the former president could be reinstated after the midterm
elections in November.]{.underline} Bobb told the conservative news
outlet the Right Side Broadcasting Network (RSBN) what [she thought
could happen in states in which there was \"evidence that Joe Biden
cheated\" in the election Trump and his allies have continuously claimed
was fraudulent]{.underline}. \"They could withdraw their electors, or
they could actually decide to award Trump electors, although I would
anticipate they will probably just withdraw the electors,\" she said.
\"If that happens from three different states, three different
resolutions go into Congress,\" she said it would then be up to Congress
to decide \"whether they want to accept the resolutions, whether they
want to act on them or not.\" Trump ally [Christina Bobb has told RSBN
about how the 2020 election result the former president disputes could
still be overturned \"It is a complex issue that needs to be handled
complexly by different state legislators and U.S. Congress, I actually
think that it\'s designed well, because you don\'t want this to be
something that you can quickly easily overturn elections,\"]{.underline}
she said. \"It needs to be something that you need many, many elected
officials to take action on,\" and the \"majority of three different
legislators.\" \"I don\'t know if this Congress would take action on it,
however after 22\...there might be, who knows?\" she added, referring to
the aftermath of the midterm elections in November, which could see
Democrats lose seats. [Dozens of court cases and recounts state by state
have verified Biden\'s victory, while Trump\'s own Department of Justice
found no evidence of fraud in 2020 after extensive investigations. It
comes as drop boxes became the new front for Trump and Republicans
pushing unfounded claims of a rigged election.]{.underline} The
[conservative-controlled Supreme Court in Wisconsin ruled on Friday that
absentee ballot drop boxes, which Trump and his allies claim facilitate
cheating, can only be placed in election offices and that only a voter
can return a vote in person]{.underline}. It spurred Trump to write on
his Truth Social account that the court\'s decision showed \"I won the
very closely contested (not actually) Wisconsin Presidential race
because they used these corrupt and scandal-ridden Scam Boxes.\" [There
is no evidence that the vote in Wisconsin, or anywhere else in the U.S.
was fraudulent. The new voting restrictions in Wisconsin are expected to
impact Democrats more and come amid changes to election rules being
pursued by GOP legislatures, most of which are fueled by the claims
about the 2020 election.]{.underline}

"A week is a long time in politics," former British Prime Minister
Harold Wilson once said. By that standard, four months is an eternity.
Everything could change between now and Nov. 8. At least, Democrats
better hope so. Because as things now stand, [Democrats are likely to
lose their slim majority in the House of Representatives.]{.underline}
If that happens, President Biden's agenda will be doomed. One shock has
already happened: the Supreme Court's decision in the Dobbs case last
month to overturn Roe v. Wade and thereby end the constitutionally
protected status of abortion rights[. You can't take away a right that
Americans have had for 50 years without expecting a political
backlash]{.underline}. Like what's happening now. "It's up to every
single one of us to go out day after day after day until November," Rep.
Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) told protesters outside the Supreme Court. What
exactly can the voters do this November? They can elect more Democrats
to the House and Senate, thereby making it more likely that Congress
will give statutory protection to abortion rights. As long as the
filibuster is in place, however, such a measure is likely to go nowhere
in the Senate[. The prospect of either party gaining a 60-vote (and
thereby filibuster-proof) Senate majority seems remote. And Democrats
may want the filibuster in place if they lose their single-vote majority
in the Senate this year]{.underline}. Donald [Trump is eager to get
press attention in order to defend himself from the damaging revelations
coming out of the Jan. 6 committee hearings in Congress]{.underline}.
[Suppose Trump enters the 2024 presidential race before November. It
would electrify the 2022 campaign]{.underline}, especially if the
Justice Department initiates a criminal investigation of the former
president. Democrats would have a powerful issue: ["Look at what
President Trump did to the Supreme Court. Imagine what he could do if he
is reelected with a Republican Congress!"]{.underline} Some Democrats
are supporting extremist Republicans in the GOP primaries --- on the
theory that they would be easy to defeat in November. Those Democrats
are missing a crucial fact about political behavior. Democrats now
control the White House and both houses of Congress. When voters vote
for the opposition party, they are typically not making an ideological
statement. They are voting for change[. If the demand for change becomes
strong enough, many people will vote for the opposition party no matter
who the candidate is.]{.underline} [Once voters start saying, "We can't
go on like this!" --- inflation, gas prices, crime, immigration --- even
radical opposition candidates will look acceptable.]{.underline} Do
Democrats really want to take that risk? [Suppose Republicans do enjoy a
sweeping victory this year. Will it mean anything for the 2024
presidential race? Not necessarily. Ronald Reagan's first midterm
election in 1982 was a serious setback for the new president and his
party]{.underline}. The [country was in a deep recession (10.8 percent
unemployment) following the hyperinflation of the Carter years.
Reaganomics had never worked. **Republicans ended up losing 26 House
seats, one Senate seat and seven governors**]{.underline}. [Republicans
were able to limit their losses by running on the theme "Stay the
course!" Voters knew what the course was]{.underline}. Reagan had set it
out in his first budget message to Congress in February 1981: "This plan
is aimed at reducing the growth in government spending and taxing
\[and\] reforming and eliminating regulations which are unnecessary and
unproductive." At the same time, President Reagan promised to protect
"the social safety net." In fact, Reagan was the first president to use
the term "safety net." Will Biden be able to argue "Stay the course" in
2024? His "Build Back Better" program has never gotten through a
nominally Democratic Congress[. By 1984, it was "Morning in America."
The economic recovery was underway, unemployment was falling and, most
importantly, the inflation rate dropped from 13.6 to 4.3 percent. Reagan
was reelected with almost 60 percent of the popular vote.]{.underline}
Bill [Clinton's first midterm in 1992 was a catastrophe for his
party]{.underline}. It was the year of the "angry white male." [With a
net loss of 54 seats, Democrats lost their majority in the House of
Representatives for the first time in 40 years.]{.underline} And [look
at what happened two years later. In 1996, Clinton was easily reelected
over Republican Bob Dole]{.underline}. A tough agenda: Biden and AMLO to
talk migration, crime, the economy The unintended consequences (and
benefits) of high energy costs Barack Obama faced a huge "tea party"
uprising in his first midterm in 2010. The backlash to Obamacare brought
Republicans a phenomenal gain of 63 House seats --- the largest midterm
election shift since 1938. What did it mean two years later? Nothing.
Obama was reelected over Republican Mitt Romney with 51 percent of the
popular vote --- the first Democrat to carry a majority of the popular
vote twice since FDR. Here's a prediction: [If Republicans win the House
this year]{.underline}, [they will vote to impeach Biden.]{.underline}
For what? They'll find something. [But they won't convict him because
they won't have anything close to the required two-thirds majority in
the Senate. The popular backlash to a spite-driven impeachment will
deliver a second term for Biden in 2024.]{.underline}

### IMPACT-Political Violence/Civil War

#### Political Unrest and Fragility cause violence

**Grono 2022**[,]{.underline} Nick, Former Deputy President and Chief
Operating Officer, Fragile States and Conflict June 22 2022,
International Crisis Group,
https://www.crisisgroup.org/global/fragile-states-and-conflict

[Fragile and failed states have been with us since we\'ve had a
state-based international order. But the interest of policymakers in
such states took on a new life after 9/11. The events of that day, and
subsequent terrorist attacks, made devastatingly clear just how
dangerous failed states such as Afghanistan could be, not only to their
own people, but to communities around the world.]{.underline}
Afghanistan and the neighboring tribal areas of Pakistan continue to
demonstrate the threat posed by ungoverned areas to their citizens,
their neighbors and the broader international community. Somalia has
been a failed state since the nineties, and has recaptured the
international community's attention in recent years -- not because of
the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in the country, but because it has
become a base and haven for pirates preying on international shipping.
And an unsuccessful bomber who probably received training in Yemen has
been the catalyst for a surge of international interest in that fragile
state. So what is a fragile state? There's now a substantial body of
literature on such states. And every academic or agency appears to have
their own descriptor -- so apart from fragile statues, you also have
states that are "weak," "failing," "failed," "collapsed," "at risk,"
"precarious", "vulnerable" or "recovering". Some of these are alternate
descriptions to "fragile" and some are encompassed within it. Even the
term "fragile state" has come under criticism in recent years. Some
scholars now consider the term both pejorative and analytically
imprecise. They claim that fragility is not an either/or concept but
rather exists along a continuum, and that it is highly context-specific
and comes in a variety of economic, political, and social forms. But
regardless of the specific conceptual formulation, these descriptors and
analyses all point to some type of significant state failure or
dysfunction. The World Bank provides a good working definition,
observing such states "share a common fragility, in two particular
respects[: State policies and institutions are weak in these countries:
making them vulnerable in their capacity to deliver services to their
citizens, to control corruption, or to provide for sufficient voice and
accountability. They face risks of conflict and political instability."
Predicting conflict in fragile states One consistent theme is the strong
correlation between state fragility and conflict. Not all states
experiencing conflict are fragile (India is a good example, with a
number of internal conflicts, and the conflict in Kashmir), but most of
them are; and not all fragile states are experiencing conflict, but
almost all of them of them are or recently have. The World Bank
identifies 37 fragile situations in 2010 -- and all bar a small handful
are post conflict or conflict affected.]{.underline} It shouldn't be
surprising that there is such a strong correlation. Many of the
indicators for conflict are indicators for state weakness[. Low and
declining growth are widely recognised indicators for conflict - and low
income and weak growth typically translate into lack of state capacity.
A lack of state capacity usually results in an inability to mediate
between competing interests. Low income also lowers the cost of
rebellion, making it more attractive to would-be rebels. And the
converse is also true. Conflict invariably has a negative impact on
economic growth. Resources directed to conflict are diverted from
development. Conflict destroys the infrastructure needed for economic
activity. And without security, development efforts are unlikely to take
hold and have the desired effects. While **the link between fragility
and conflict is** by now **widely accepted** there is certainly no
similar consensus about how this link plays out in
practice.]{.underline} Much academic work is now devoted to mapping the
various causal flows between fragility and conflict. And it's the kind
of academic work that has direct relevance to policymakers, particularly
when it comes to prevention and its necessary accompaniment, prediction.
Policymakers focus on the linkages in their efforts to obtain early
warning of fragile states that may slip into conflict, and in an effort
to ensure timely and cost-effective responses. There is no shortage of
early warning in this age of proliferating NGOs, instant and widespread
internet and satellite communications, and an awareness of the threat
posed by failing states. In fact, there may be too much of it -- the
challenge for policymakers can be to determine which of the barrage of
warning they receive is credible, and requires action, and which can be
ignored. The related challenge is to tie early warning to effective
early action - early action here means policy response by governments
and international and regional organisations. Analytical and advocacy
NGOs have the luxury, and the frustration, of being able to warn, but
not being able to respond. So what kind of early warning do policymakers
have access to? Very broadly, there are two types of early warning --
qualitative and quantitative warning. The early warning produced by my
organization, the International Crisis Group, is a good example of
qualitative early warning. The task of our analysts is to find out what
is happening and why[. They identify the underlying political, social
and economic factors creating the conditions for conflict as well as the
more immediate causes of tension. Our role is to warn, as early and
effectively as possible, those who are able to influence a situation
where the risk of new or renewed conflict has reached a dangerous
threshold. Crisis Group's particular value-added in this respect is that
all our reporting and analysis is field-based.]{.underline} At last
count we had people on the ground from 50 different nationalities,
speaking between them 49 different languages. They are steeped in local
language and culture, getting dust on their boots, engaged in endless
interaction with locals and internationals on the scene, and operating
from 9 regional offices and 17 other locations in the field. Crisis
Group also produces the monthly CrisisWatch bulletin which summarises
developments dur­ing the previous month in some 70 situations of current
or potential conflict, assessing for each whether the overall situation
has significantly deteriorated, improved, or on balance remained more or
less unchanged. This is one of the few examples of very short term early
warning in the public domain. The challenge that this kind of
qualitative early warning poses for policymakers is that its credibility
and hence usability relies to a significant extent on the reputation of
the external provider of such analysis. It is difficult, though not
impossible, for governments to make big resource allocation decisions
(ie whether to intervene to seek to prevent a looming conflict) on the
basis of independent, non government, analysis. Of course, governments
have their own analysts, but these often they won't have the expertise,
or the institutional freedom, of their non-governmental peers. There are
ways to incorporate independent qualitative analysis into governments'
own analysis and planning, but the constraints will usually act to
inhibit governments from using such external analysis as the predominant
basis for their early response decision making. This is where
quantitative early warning comes into the picture. The advantage (in
theory) behind quantitative analysis is that it relies on verifiable
data, and hence provides an independent and transparent basis for making
resource allocation decisions. That's the theory. The reality is more
complex. Quantitative warning, relying as it does on statistical
analysis, requires a model of conflict with quantifiable factors that
can be measured, compared and analysed. But this conflict modelling is
still more of an art than a science, despite rapid advances in the field
over the last decade or so. The other challenge with quantitative
warning is the timeframe of its predictive ability. It is much better
adapted to highlight worrying trends than to identify with great
specificity a likely tipping point into violence. Quantitative theories
used to be broadly, if simplistically divided into two camps -- that of
greed versus grievance -- with the greed camp holding that economic
factors were largely responsible for conflict, and the grievance camp
blaming on inequality and political, ethnic and religious grievances.
The debate has been refined in recent years - concurrent with big
improvements in the data - and now is more usefully characterized as one
between feasibility and regime type, with the proponents of the
feasibility thesis focusing on the conditions that determine the
economic viability of rebellion, whereas the regime type proponents
conclude that it is political institutions and not economic conditions
that are the most powerful predictor of instability. The doyen on the
feasibility side of the debate is Oxford academic Paul Collier. His
models have been developed and refined over the years, but the essence
of his analysis is that the defining feature of civil war is the
emergence and durability of a private rebel army, and under most
conditions such organizations are likely to be neither financially nor
militarily feasible. Civil war will only occur if a rebel organisation
can build and sustain a private army. He and his co-authors go on to
argue that "where insurrection is feasible it will occur, with the
actual agenda of the rebel movement being indeterminate." Their research
shows that three factors in particular are important in demonstrating
feasibility of conflict - namely low per capita income, slow economic
growth, and large exports of natural resources. Further variables have
been recently added to the model, namely whether a country is under the
implicit French security umbrella and the proportion of its population
who are males in the age range 15-29, and a weaker variable that
mountainous countries are more conflict prone (see "Beyond Greed and
Grievance: Feasibility and Civil War", Paul Collier, Anke Hoeffler and
Dominic Rohner, May 2008). Low per capita income points to the
incapacity of the state to maintain effective control over its
territory. Both low income and slow growth can be interpreted as
lowering the recruitment cost of rebel troops, and natural resources can
provide rebel organizations with finance. The attractiveness of this
theory of conflict is that most of these factors can be quantified. And
many civil conflicts over the past couple of decades can be readily
explained by it -- for example, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Angola, Congo,
Sudan, Aceh, Niger Delta, and Cote d'Ivoire -- but does not provide a
robust explanation for all civil conflicts or for the lack of conflict
in some states. Collier has more recently looked at the links between
democracy, development and conflict. He has argued that income level is
the key factor in preventing violence during transitions to democracy.
He believes that while the international community often favours
promoting democracy as a solution to overcoming violent conflict,
democracy also constrains the technical possibilities of government
repression, and that this makes rebellion easier. Although the net
effect of democracy is therefore ambiguous, he suggests that the higher
is income the more likely is it to be favourable. He finds that whereas
in rich countries democracy makes countries safer, below an income
threshold democracy increases proneness to political violence. The
regime type advocates take a different approach. The most sophisticated
and sustained research on factors influencing motivation has been done
by the Political Instability Task Force (formerly known as the State
Failure Task Force), a panel of scholars that has worked since 1994 to
collect and analyze data on political regimes and conflict around the
world. Its work has focused particularly on regime type and quality. The
Task Force's research postulates that regime type is overwhelmingly the
dominant factor behind revolutions, ethnic wars, and adverse regime
changes. However, the effect of regime type is not a simple function of
the degree of democracy or autocracy. The starting point is that strong
autocracies are rarely prone to conflict[**. Strong democracies are also
not prone to conflict**. It is certain kinds of partial autocracies and
partial democracies that are much more vulnerable than other regime
types, with the vulnerability depending on the patterns of executive
recruitment and political participation under those
regimes]{.underline}. A particularly strong contributor to instability
is that of factionalism within the political process. The taskforce
model has four independent variables: regime type, infant mortality (as
a proxy for poverty), a "bad neighborhood" indicator flagging cases with
four or more bordering states embroiled in armed civil or ethnic
conflict, and the presence or absence of state-led discrimination. They
claim for this model an 80% success rate in identifying likely
instability within a period of two years. Interesting recent research
has also looked at the linkage between climate and conflict. Studies by
scholars such as Edward Miguel at Berkeley attempt to establish clear
causal links between climate factors and conflict. While most studies
claim that poverty (which can be intensified or induced by climate
change) has suffered from questions of reverse causality -- namely,
whether conflict leads to poverty or vice versa - Miguel finds that
drops in rainfall in Africa, clearly an exogenous factor not affected by
conflict, produce drops in income, increasing the likelihood of conflict
the following year by nearly half. He recommends pre-empting violence by
targeting foreign aid to shore up incomes in regions where livelihood is
affected by rainfall, thereby removing a short term trigger of violence.
The latest work in this field has moved beyond precipitation to looking
at warming and finds strong historical linkages between civil war and
temperature in Africa, with warmer years leading to significant
increases in the likelihood of war. One recent research paper suggested
a roughly 54% increase in armed conflict incidence by 2030 if current
climate model projections are correct. So that is a very quick run
through of the current models for predicting conflict and instability.
As mentioned earlier, the effectiveness of this type of quantitative
analysis depends on the robustness of the models, and the quality of the
data -- and these are both continuing to evolve. For policymakers
seeking to establishes processes in which early response is less ad hoc
and more systematic, perhaps the best course of action is to use
quantitative analysis to identify a small group of fragile states at
risk of violent conflict within a two year timeframe, and then
incorporate external qualitative analysis to refine that list and
determine the most appropriate intervention. Policy approaches to
fragile states Another difference between quantitative and qualitative
analysis is that while the former may tell policymakers when to
intervene, it doesn't give them much guidance on how. Good qualitative
analysis is much better geared to inform policymakers' interventions in
particular fragile states. So how should policymakers engage with such
states? Given the variations between states, their problems, the tools
available to interveners, the political will to intervene and all the
other permutations, I won't attempt to set out a menu of policy options
here. However there are a number of guidelines that could usefully
inform interventions in all fragile states. 1. Understand the problem.
This is perhaps a statement of the obvious -- but it is salutary to
understand how often the obvious is ignored when the international
community intervenes. Far too often lessons painfully learned in earlier
interventions are forgotten or ignored. There is no checklist of
appropriate policies for fragile states. What may have worked in Iraq
for instance -- such as international support for tribally based
militias - is unlikely to work in Afghanistan. In fact in the latter
country, the last five years have seen failed incarnations of the same
policy on militias -- first in the form of arbakai (tribal militias),
then the Afghan National Auxiliary Police, then the Afghan Public
Protection Force, and now the Coalition appears determined to repeat the
failures of those initiatives with its latest effort, the Local Defense
Initiative. So perhaps an exhortation to understand the problem is not
quite as obvious as it seems. Policies have to be evidence-based. They
have to build on a field-based understanding of the history, culture,
political dynamics and region. This is where the work of organizations
like Crisis Group is so important. We produced field-based policy
reports. Our analysts are stationed in or near the countries they cover.
They are steeped in an understanding of the country, its culture,
politics, and the interests of the key players. They can and do travel
around countries much more freely than embassy staff can. They usually
have better access too. All of which is reflected in our analysis. 2.
Recognise that prevention is better than cure, and that prevention does
work. There was an excellent report published in 2005 -- the Human
Security Report -- which documented the trends in conflicts since the
Second World War. (The 2009 issue of this report is forthcoming.) Its
headline statistic is an encouraging one, and perhaps counterintuitive
-- namely that there has been a 40% reduction in the number of
state-based armed conflicts since the early 1990s. And, while there has
been a small uptick in the number of state-based conflicts since 2003,
when non-state conflicts are included (i.e. conflicts in which all both
parties are non-state actors, such as rebel groups) there has been a
continuing decline in the overall number of conflicts since 2003. There
has also been a longer term trend decline in battle deaths (ie military
personal and civilians killed in fighting.) There were only some 12,000
reported battle deaths in 2005 -- less than any year since 1946. Why has
there been a decline in conflict, and what lessons can we learn from
these trends? The Human Security Report posits a number of causes, such
as end of the Cold War leading to a reduction in proxy conflicts, and
the growth in the number of democracies. But it attributes much of the
reduction to a surge in international conflict prevention and resolution
activities in the 1990s, led by a reinvigorated United Nations. Between
1987 and 2008, the number of Special Representatives of the Secretary-
General increased six-fold. UN peacekeeping missions -- which play a key
role in preventing renewed conflict - increased from four in 1990 to 15
currently.\[v\] The international financial institutions and donor
governments and civil society have played a significant role with their
efforts to address the root causes of conflict. The key message is that
conflict prevention efforts, for all their failings and inadequacies,
can make a real difference. There are some examples of where these
advances -- seen, for example, in the rise in resources devoted to
peacekeeping and conflict prevention work among national governments,
stronger regional peace and security response mechanisms, the evolution
of vibrant civil society engagement in conflict resolution and
reconciliation initiatives, and advances at the level of international
law -- have paid dividends. In some cases, coordinated international
engagement has been instrumental in shifting states affected by
devastating civil wars onto the fragile road to transition. Countries
such as Liberia, Sierra Leone, Burundi and Nepal continue to face
considerable challenges, in economic development, institution building
and professionalization of their public services in the wake of
devastating civil wars. The painful and long-term task of reconciling
societies damaged by war will remain relevant for some years. But these
states also managed to execute a transition to post-war recovery that
would have seemed inconceivable in the early 2000s. Concerted efforts by
regional organisations, such as the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), have also played a decisive role in preventing violent
outbreak in fragile states and in bringing states back to the fold. We
saw some encouraging evidence of the impact of coordinated regional and
international engagement in Guinea over the past few months. Effective
regional and international actions in response to 2009's military
takeover have been instrumental in encouraging the country's shift back
to civilian rule from January this year. Of course, there is no room for
complacency. [Climate change, the fallout from the global economic
crisis (including falling commodity prices and reduced remittances from
diasporas), the aftermath of recent fuel and food price shocks, and a
likely fall in the aid and development budgets of rich countries are all
likely to increase the likelihood of conflict in fragile states in the
coming years.]{.underline} Given this outlook, policymakers need to
develop smarter and more cost effective interventions. And that being
the case, we need to recognise that prevention is not only more
effective than intervention after the bullets have started flying -- but
(and this should be music to policymakers' ears) it is also much
cheaper. A 2004 study estimated that on average one euro spent on
conflict prevention generates over 4 euros in savings to the
international community.\[vi\] As with all such studies, there are a
number of heroic assumptions involved - but not so heroic to render the
key finding redundant, namely that the cost of properly targeted
prevention is a lot less than the cost of conflict. To give some
concrete figures, though again, very much context specific: the former
UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has estimated that the small preventive
military deployment in Macedonia, stopping the slide to war there, cost
the British taxpayer £14 million (24 m euros), while fighting the war in
Kosovo, by contrast, cost Britain £200 million (350 m euros), and in
Bosnia over £1.5 billion (2.6 billion euros). And those are just the
military costs, not the costs of reconstruction. 3. Understand the
regional context Fragile state policies are generally geared towards
individual states, and too often ignore the regional context. But as the
experience of Africa and the Balkans and South Asia have amply
demonstrated \-- conflict and state-failure usually have very strong
regional dynamics. Neighboring states can contribute to conflict in a
number of ways. The most obvious is by being a party to the conflict.
They can be active participants, for instance by being at war with the
state in question, but more usually they are indirect participants,
preferring to support proxy militias or fund rebel groups. Rwanda and
Uganda were both in the Congo. Neighboring states can also provide a
safe haven for rebels or spoilers, as Pakistan is doing with the
Taliban, and Chad and Sudan are doing for each other's rebels. They can
funnel arms and supplies to governments or rebels (as some 11 countries
are alleged to have been doing in Somalia, many of them being
neighboring countries); or they can be more subtle in their
destabilisation -- as one could perhaps characterise Ethiopia's role in
Somalia, as it pulled its troops after its intervention, leaving a
security vacuum and likely ensuring Somalia remains a failed state for
many years yet. As noted above, the Political Instability Task Force has
identified "bad neighborhood" as a statistically significant risk factor
for conflict, with bad neighborhood here being defined as four or more
bordering states embroiled in armed civil or ethnic conflict. So when it
comes to strengthening or rebuilding fragile states, failing to address
these regional dynamics will probably consign even the best-designed and
most well-intentioned peacekeeping mission or development assistance
package to failure as soon as the troops leave or the donor community's
generosity runs dry. 4. Commit the necessary political, financial and
security resources The key political resource is a commitment to stay
the course. It takes many years to rebuild a state, and premature
disengagement can very quickly destroy all the progress and the billions
invested in rebuilding. Just look at Timor Leste, where premature
disengagement allowed that country to fall back into conflict, with the
result that in 2006 it was almost back to where it started after its
violent rebirth in 1999. Doubt among Afghans about the international
community's commitment to stay feeds insecurity there, and feeds
patronage-based politics, and a willingness to do deals with the
insurgent leadership - driven in part by their fear that the
internationals will abandon them, as they have done in the past. The sad
fact is that the international community isn't good at staying the
course. Too often we adopt a formulaic approach -- particularly to those
states requiring large scale international intervention. The standard
response is a four or five year commitment, in the form of largish
peacekeeping missions to back up internationally mediated peace
agreements or Security Council resolutions, some DDR (disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration of combatants) and SSR (security system
reform) followed by a rush of indigestible aid dollars, a flurry of
institution building, and premature elections -- followed too often and
too soon by a withdrawal of peacekeeping troops and a drying up of aid
money just when it is most needed and the absorptive capacity is able to
beginning coping with it. A rush to early elections can be particularly
problematic. Holding elections -- although good for political show
business (and, in post-conflict peacebuilding contexts, much loved as an
exit benchmark for governments anxious to meet their commitments and go
home) - quite often has nothing much to do with democracy. Crisis Group
was one of the first organisations to really make this point loudly and
clearly, opposing as we did a rush to an early election in Bosnia in
1996 because we feared this would consolidate ethnic divisions which
hadn't had the chance to be counterbalanced by the development national
secular political forces, or at least strong civil society institutions.
The recent presidential election in Afghanistan, held when there
evidently wasn't the domestic institutional capacity to manage a
credible and legitimate process, is another example. We know that the
period of transition to democracy is in many ways one of the most
dangerous and fragile of all. This doesn't mean that we should retreat
from democratisation, but that we should rethink our priorities in the
way we pursue it. The most important of all things to prioritise is the
rule of law -- often a very difficult challenge, but essential if
democratic institutions are to take root and flourish. When it comes to
financial resources -- the temptation is to do it on the cheap. This is
the ultimate false economy. Conflict imposes horrendous financial costs,
not to mention the devastating human toll. And failure to get it right
after conflict significantly increases the risk of a return to conflict.
It has been estimated (in 2004) that civil war in a low-income country
costs that country and its neighbors on average 42 billion euros in
direct and indirect costs. That is for a single conflict. To put that
figure in perspective, the worldwide aid budget in 2004 was 60 billion
euros. So we should properly fund effective prevention, and thereby
reduce the costs spent on peacebuilding post-conflict reconstruction.
And when we do have to fund peacebuilding, we shouldn't do it on the
cheap -- as the likelihood is that this will increase the risk of the
country falling back into conflict, thereby requiring yet further
expenditure on peacekeeping and stabilisation forces and the follow-up
peacebuilding. Finally there are the security resources. A secure
environment is a necessary but not sufficient condition to strengthening
a fragile state. It's sobering to realise that rebel groups and militias
responsible for terrorizing a country or large parts of it are often
very weak and brittle. They often survive and prosper because there are
no capable forces to oppose them. When confronted with effective forces,
they will often collapse -- as happened with the rebels in Sierra Leone
(confronted first by the mercenaries of Executive Outcomes, and
subsequently routed by a few hundred British special forces); militias
in Bunia, DRC (confronted by EU/French forces in Operation Artemis); or
rebelling soldiers recently in Timor Leste (confronted by Australian
troops and police). More importantly, security guarantees can be
critical in deterring future spoilers. The ability to rapidly deploy an
effective military force can be sufficient to ensure that the need to
deploy will not arise. The commitment can be an over-the-horizon one --
as the UK provided to Sierra Leone -- but it needs to be real and
credible. But sometimes a small security commitment will not be
sufficient, and large scale sustained commitments are required. Even
then, an effective and timely commitment may repay the investment many
fold in terms of the avoidance of future costs. Such commitments are
expensive and politically difficult -- particularly where there is a
likelihood of casualties -- but as always the cost of failing has to be
weighed against the cost of the commitment. Back in March 2002, when
there were some 4,500 NATO peacekeepers stationed in Kabul, Crisis Group
called for the peacekeeping force to be expanded to 25,000-30,000 and
deployed around the country -- a call subject to much criticism and
ridicule from some Coalition governments, and NATO itself, as being
greatly in excess of what was needed or feasible. Some eight years
later, NATO is on track to have 150,000 troops deployed by September
2010. Conclusion Fragile states need lots of security and lots of
development if they are to become viable and effective states in future.
[And it's important to remember that in a globalised world, it's not
just capital and trade that travel the world **-- terrorism and
extremism can also be exported, or nurtured in fragile states**, and
ill-gotten funds laundered by them. But while that provides an incentive
for international engagement, it's important that it not become the sole
justification for engagement. Fragile states inflict untold misery on
their citizens and on neighboring countries.]{.underline} When it comes
to addressing state fragility we increasingly understand what works and
what doesn't -- even if we are a long way from having all the answers
yet. We certainly know enough to know that we aren't doing enough to
assist such states. Earlier and better targeted assistance to fragile
states would dramatically improve the quality of life for hundreds of
millions of people, which makes it a tremendously worthy goal in its own
right.

#### The impact of a civil war outweighs all aff impact scenarios -- civil war is probable in this context, goes international and effects become widespread

As interstate war has become less common, academic attention has shifted
to the plethora of armed conflicts occurring within the boundaries of
states. These [civil wars have proven to be more protracted and
difficult to terminate for numerous reasons that vary according to their
unique socio-economic, political and cultural contexts.]{.underline}
Hence, providing a perfect general theory is problematic. Nevertheless,
a number of critical factors that affect the duration of civil wars and
their inability to be resolved relative to interstate wars can be
distinguished. Firstly, unlike interstate wars, which occur between
clearly-defined armies and are generally amenable to compromise**[,
[civil]{.mark} [wars]{.mark} [tend]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [be]{.mark}
low-intensity, [existential]{.mark} [struggles]{.mark}, [making]{.mark}
[them]{.mark}, therefore, [inherently]{.mark}-[protracted]{.mark}
[affairs]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover, the decentralized
organizational structure of contemporary insurgencies and their tendency
to fragment and become engulfed in internecine fighting further
undermines attempts at reaching a political settlement. Third[,
[peace]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [difficult]{.mark} to achieve [when]{.mark},
for many actors, [war]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [preferable]{.mark}. Often
ignored is the capacity of war to endow belligerents with profits and
power. Various cases of "enemies" colluding to prolong violence
challenge the common assumption that the ultimate objective of war is
victory.]{.underline} Finally, the essay questions what an "end" to
civil war implies. [[Even]{.mark} [when]{.mark} [one]{.mark}
[side]{.mark} [claims]{.mark} [total]{.mark} [victory]{.mark}
[or]{.mark} in the rare cases where [peace]{.mark} [accords]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} [signed]{.mark} and the war is formally concluded, the
[transition]{.mark} [from]{.mark} large-scale [civil]{.mark}
[violence]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [peace]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [not]{.mark} so
[clear]{.mark}.]{.underline} Collective memories of mutual violence
persist into the post-conflict period, and cultures of violence are
sustained. [If not fully addressed, along with the underlying grievances
that originally inspire violence, peace will remain at best fragile, and
violence may continue in other forms.]{.underline} In this light, even
the success stories of post-accord societies in Latin America and
Lebanon appear to be "unfinished" civil wars.\[1\] The Asymmetric Nature
of Civil Wars: Given that interstate wars are generally fought in a
series of direct confrontations between professional armies and across
defined frontlines, they are relatively quick and decisive. In contrast,
intrastate wars are distinguished by the asymmetric distribution of
material power among the main parties of the conflict, usually the
incumbent government or power and the rebels or insurgents opposing it[.
The asymmetric nature of internal conflicts forces insurgents to adopt a
strategy of guerrilla warfare in which the evasion of the enemy is a
matter of survival.]{.underline} To overcome its military weakness, the
insurgent force gradually wears down the enemy through hit-and-run
tactics. [Civil war is thus an inherently-protracted affair**. What adds
complexity to [these]{.mark} [wars]{.mark} is that they [are]{.mark}
[almost]{.mark} [never]{.mark} wholly [internal]{.mark}. [In]{.mark} an
[age]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [interconnectivity]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[interdependency]{.mark}, their [outcome]{.mark} [is]{.mark} often of
[strategic]{.mark} interest [not]{.mark} [only]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[neighboring]{.mark} [powers]{.mark} [but]{.mark} [also]{.mark} to the
[international]{.mark} [community]{.mark} at-large**]{.underline}. The
[role of external intervention in influencing the balance of power
between parties and therefore the trajectory of civil wars is
critical.]{.underline} When external intervention is balanced between
the opposing sides it can increase the duration of war.\[2\]
[[This]{.mark} [was]{.mark} [most]{.mark} [evident]{.mark} when the
[Cold]{.mark} [War]{.mark} superpowers played out their ideological
struggle in the conflict theater of the global South]{.underline}. The
weaponry and supplies they provided fueled some of the most ferocious
internal conflicts. Similarly, the internationalization of the
contemporary Syrian conflict seems to have reconfigured the balance of
power towards a prolonged stalemate.\[3\] Here, [negotiation may only be
contemplated when both parties reach a "mutually hurting
stalemate,]{.underline}"\[4\] that is, a stage of deadlock when both
sides simultaneously perceive continued fighting as offering little
returns and mounting costs. However, with external actors distorting the
perception of warring parties' prospects on the battlefield, arriving at
this stage may take many years. [Limited Space for Compromise Interstate
[wars]{.mark} may be [driven]{.mark} [by]{.mark} border disputes; they
could be a reaction to some [existential]{.mark} [threat]{.mark}, an
[attempt]{.mark} [at]{.mark} [regional]{.mark} [hegemony]{.mark},
[or]{.mark} a [contest]{.mark} for [access]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[trade]{.mark} [routes]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [resources]{.mark}, to name
a few]{.underline}. In theory, all of these factors are amenable to
compromise, even if they too can produce long and costly wars. The
Persian Gulf War is but one example; after eight years of conflict,
Saddam Hussein relinquished his demands for complete control over
Shatt-Al Arab and began withdrawing his forces from Iran, effectively
bringing the war to a close. Where civil wars are driven by limited aims
and objectives, the government can respond with the necessary reforms
and negotiate with the aggrieved parties to stifle the conflict**[.
[When]{.mark} the [objective]{.mark} [is]{.mark} to [secede]{.mark},
[to]{.mark} [overthrow]{.mark} the [government,]{.mark} [or]{.mark} even
to radically [transform]{.mark} [social]{.mark} [structures]{.mark},
[compromise]{.mark} is [improbable]{.mark} [if]{.mark} [not]{.mark}
[impossible]{.mark}. [Secession]{.mark} is [unfeasible]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} [there]{.mark} [can]{.mark} [only]{.mark} [be]{.mark}
[one]{.mark} [government]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Such]{.mark}
[wars]{.mark} [are]{.mark} [existential]{.mark} struggles with each side
framing the conflict in terms of "victory or death."]{.underline}
**[[Unsurprisingly]{.mark}, they [take]{.mark} an [intensely]{.mark}
[violent]{.mark} [nature]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Where belligerents
cannot envision a common future of power sharing, incumbents have
attempted to delegitimize their opponents by labeling them "terrorists,"
"criminals," or " foreign agents."]{.underline} [This
[de-politicization]{.mark} of the opposition is a common feature of
civil wars and [serves]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a [serious]{.mark}
[impediment]{.mark} [to]{.mark} their [termination]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} [civil]{.mark} [means]{.mark}. As long as insurgents
are excluded from the political arena, violent force will remain their
primary means of communication]{.underline}. In other cases, parties may
be willing to compromise on their original political goals and form a
united government[. However, the vulnerability of disarming and
demobilizing entails, given the absence of mutual trust and the lack of
a third party entity to monitor and enforce the agreement, can encourage
combatants to reject opportunities for a peace
settlement.]{.underline}\[5\] Here, it is the security dilemma, rather
than the limited scope of compromise that inhibits the resolution of
civil wars.\[6\] Organizational Structure: Fragmentation and Internal
Rivalry A central requirement for any effective peace settlement is the
presence of strong, representative leaders at the negotiating table.
Interstate wars meet this condition more easily[. Governments tend to
maintain a unified hierarchical structure, with a strategic apex that
exerts a tight reign over its security apparatus. In contrast,
contemporary insurgencies are decentralized coalitions, plagued by
factionalism and weak command and control.]{.underline}\[7\] Their
propensity for **[[fragmentation]{.mark} [is]{.mark} a [serious]{.mark}
[impediment]{.mark}]{.underline}** to their resolution, which only
becomes more potent as the war goes on and as new sub-groups emerge with
their own interests and agendas. [As the number of parties to a conflict
increases, the prospects for agreement shrink, and, consequently, the
duration of the internal war expands]{.underline}.\[8\] The contemporary
experience of Syria is telling. As the war enters its third year, the
broad coalition of groups constituting the armed opposition has grown to
include thousands of foreign fighters and Salafist groups such as Jabhat
al-Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant,
who all possess their own unique ideological vision of Syria's
future.\[9\] These increasingly potent groups, among other factions,
refuse to succumb to the influence and control of the Free Syrian Army
and its political wing, viewing the latter as an elite grouping of
self-interested exiles. **[The [detachment]{.mark} [between]{.mark} the
[political]{.mark} [wing]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [opposition]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} those on the [battleground]{.mark} is
[problematic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Any decision made on the
negotiating table at the national or international level is of limited
value without the consent of those who control the reality on the
ground. The Personalization of Civil Wars Though fragmentation can
prolong civil wars, strong leadership is not necessarily a
panacea.]{.underline} The Syrian civil war, like others, has also been
sustained by its deeply personalized nature. The reputation of Bashar Al
Assad among loyalists has achieved a "non-negotiable" status, while the
opposition has refused to accept anything short of his removal from
power. [Gaddafi and Milosevic are two examples of leaders who opted for
their own political survival over the national interest, manipulating
and inflaming existing social divisions to escalate the war and secure
their power]{.underline}.\[10\] Jonas Savimbi appeared to be the main
"spoiler" of the Bicesse peace accords, rejecting the outcome of 1992
presidential election and returning the country to a state of war.
Indeed, it was only with his death that his successor, Paulo Armindo
Lukamba returned UNITA to the negotiating table and large-scale violence
subdued.\[11\] General Michel Awn's sense of omnipotence drove him to
reject numerous invitations to join the post-Ta' if government, and
instead to declare a "war of liberation" against the Syrian military
presence that would claim more than a thousand lives.\[12\] Of course,
leaders are not always the all- powerful decision makers who the media
portrays, and placing too much emphasis on their character can lend to
their demonization. Nonetheless, the role of the individual cannot be
completely discredited either. Indeed, breakthroughs in peace
negotiations have frequently coincided with changes in the top
leadership.\[13\] A Political Economy Perspective[: Entrenched Interests
in the Continuation of Violence The amount of material destruction and
human suffering a civil war produces is immense]{.underline}. Yet, while
the majority of the population may seek its end, a minority can develop
an entrenched interest in its continuation. Thus[, attempts to explain
the [longevity]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [civil]{.mark} [wars]{.mark} are only
[complete]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [reference]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the
[political]{.mark} and [economic]{.mark} [incentives]{.mark}
[they]{.mark} [present]{.mark}. [As]{.mark} the [civil]{.mark}
[war]{.mark} [rages]{.mark} on, the [state's]{.mark} [capacity]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [control]{.mark} all its [territories]{.mark},
[enforce]{.mark} the [law]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [provide]{.mark} basic
[goods]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [services]{.mark} are
[eroded]{.mark}]{.underline}. A range of [informal actors, from
warlords, militias, and gangs, emerges to fill the vacuum, often carving
out their own enclaves where they can become the prime source of social
administration and coercion as well as the de-facto owners of the area
and its resources]{.underline}. In this context of the state
collapse**[, [ordinary]{.mark} [civilians]{.mark} can [become]{.mark}
willing [participants]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
[violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For young uneducated and unemployed
men and women, joining an armed band may be the only alternative to a
life of destitution. [Violence becomes a means of subsistence, supplying
its members with shelter and food as well as a sense of protection,
belonging and status in a society in which family networks and state
institutions have disintegrated.]{.underline}\[14\] State collapse does
not imply an inherent descent into anarchy and senseless violence.
Rather**[, an organized [war]{.mark} [economy]{.mark} [based]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} [looting]{.mark}, [extortion]{.mark}, and
[protection]{.mark} rackets [forms]{.mark} [around]{.mark} the
[armed]{.mark} [groups]{.mark}. [Militias]{.mark} originally
[relying]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [volunteers]{.mark} [to]{.mark} fill their
ranks and [finance]{.mark} their [operations]{.mark} mutate into
professional business entities [with]{.mark} profitable [links]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [regional]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [international]{.mark}
[trading]{.mark} [networks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This has been
particularly the case after the end of Cold War. With the sudden absence
of external patronage, the warring parties to many conflicts in the
South still had to look beyond their borders for alternative means of
financing their operations[. Therefore, [even]{.mark} [if]{.mark}
[economic]{.mark} [globalization]{.mark} may [not]{.mark} [cause]{.mark}
[civil]{.mark} [wars]{.mark}, for their [roots]{.mark} often
[lay]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [cultural]{.mark}, [historical]{.mark} and
[political]{.mark} [grievances]{.mark}, one cannot deny its role in
empowering violent sub-national actors by sustaining contemporary war
economies.]{.underline} \[15\] As sub-national actors develop their
taste for the status, power and profits violence accrues, they may show
small interest in capturing a weak state with no means of enforcing its
control over its territories and resources. In the current state of
conflict there is a sense of familiarity and economic security.
Meanwhile, peace represents uncertainty. For a negotiated peace is
ultimately based on promises of political and economic inclusion that
can easily be betrayed. A popular assumption is that the objective of
each of the warring parties is the total defeat of the enemy's
capability.\[16\] In reality[, the state of violent conflict can endow
criminal activities with a rare legitimacy, and therefore every effort
is made by belligerents to eschew decisive battles]{.underline}.\[17\]
Indeed, [governments may form informal alliances with their enemies to
exploit unarmed civilians and natural resources]{.underline}. In Sierra
Leone, the poor pay and training of government forces and their
affiliated irregulars encouraged them to prey on civilians rather than
engage in costly combat with the Revolutionary United Front.
Demonstrating this, elite figures in the Angolan administration and
security forces have been accused of selling weapons to UNITA on
multiple occasions.\[18\] Similarly, an authoritarian government may
deliberately prolong the civil war as a means of concentrating its power
and destroying all opposition. In the name of combating "terror" and
suppressing "rebels[," a [government]{.mark} may [declare]{.mark} a
[state]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [emergency]{.mark}; [introduce]{.mark}
[draconian]{.mark} [laws]{.mark} to limit the freedom of expression,
assembly, and association; and indefinitely delay
elections]{.underline}. The actions of the Algerian government's in its
contest with Islamist insurgents during the 1990s seem to follow this
logic. In the series of massacres of the mid and late 1990s, government
forces merely watched from a close distance as Islamist guerrillas
slaughtered and mutilated civilians for hours.\[19\] As the war
progressed, the population became alienated from the Islamist cause
while the government enjoyed an increase in its support. Only by
escalating and prolonging the war could Algeria's military regime
entrench its political power. Unfinished Civil Wars: Sustained Cultures
of Violence and the Legacy of Atrocities Even where these barriers to
negotiated settlement have been overcome and contesting forces have
engaged in dialogue and agreed to end all military confrontations, the
transition from war to peace has been less than clear. [In Nicaragua, El
Salvador, and Guatemala, the ideological violence of their protracted
civil wars seems to have been merely substituted with extreme levels of
criminal violence]{.underline}.\[20\] There are many explanations for
why "peace" can be difficult to distinguish from war. However[, in all
cases where the peace process has failed to address the roots of the
conflict and to challenge the political structures, social divisions and
economic inequalities that gave rise to insurgencies in the first place,
violence has been renewed]{.underline}. In the case of Nicaragua and
Guatemala, the continued economic marginalization of its youth and the
incomplete efforts to reintegrate ex-combatants into civilian life have
manifested in the plethora of criminal gangs that dominate urban and
increasingly rural areas and threaten the rule of law.\[21\] The same
failure to reintegrate demobilized fighters was a feature of the Dayton
and Abouja peace processes.\[22\] Post- Ta'if Lebanon's peace is at best
described as a fragile one. The incessant paralysis of state
institutions, which is to a large extent the product of the accords'
consociational formula, has allowed crime to fester and the country to
be consumed by political assassinations and kidnappings. More
problematically, it has led citizens to increasingly rely on their own
sects for economic and social security.\[23\] Consequently, the
relationship between the various confessional groups in Lebanon is still
dominated by a degree of distance, suspicion, and even animosity.
Problematically, these social divisions have proven to be easily
inflamed by regional developments and external forces as well as local
elites.\[24\] It follows that Post-Ta'if Lebanon is more accurately
conceptualized as a prolonged ceasefire, rather than as a consolidated
peace as virtually the same socio-economic and political structures that
gave rise to the civil war remain intact. In such an environment the
threat of renewed large-scale violence is omnipresent. Critical to
understanding the fragility of post-conflict societies peace are the
legacies of atrocities, which remain unaddressed. While the populations
of warring states are separated and secured by their respective borders,
civil wars do not offer such sanctuary. **[By their nature,
[civil]{.mark} [wars]{.mark} occur among and between the people and,
therefore, [claim]{.mark} [large]{.mark} [number]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[civilian]{.mark} casualties]{.underline}**. With the objective of
controlling the populace, [factions resort to coercive and brutal means.
**When [so]{.mark} [many]{.mark} [civilians]{.mark} are
[displaced]{.mark}, [brutalized]{.mark} and [killed]{.mark}, a once
unified [society]{.mark} [becomes]{.mark} a [deeply]{.mark}
[polarized]{.mark} one**]{.underline}. [[Healing]{.mark} the
[psychological]{.mark} [wounds]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a [protracted]{.mark}
[civil]{.mark} [war]{.mark} to avoid its renewal proves to be a
[long]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [challenging]{.mark} process]{.underline}.
The [[consolidation]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [peace]{.mark} is
[further]{.mark} [endangered]{.mark} [by]{.mark} the [culture]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [violence]{.mark} that protracted civil wars can breed and
sustain, and [which]{.mark} often [persists]{.mark} [into]{.mark} the
[post]{.mark}-[war]{.mark} [period]{.mark}]{.underline}. During the
civil war, the barrel of the gun becomes the main means of resolving
disputes, making demands, and attaining perceived rights among large
swaths of the population[. The intensity of battle]{.underline} and the
level of atrocities against civilians can [erode the social norms that
may have regulated the use of violence in the past]{.underline}. In the
post-civil war environment, often characterized by a weak security
apparatus and criminal justice system, the widespread availability of
weapons and weak civil society, and with the collective memories of
atrocities still fresh, every incentive is available for an individual
to distribute his or her own retributive justice. When violence is not
sanctioned and barely condemned it becomes normalized and legitimated.
Conclusion This essay has attempted to present a number of structural
explanations for the protracted and persistent nature of civil wars
relative to interstate conflicts**[. At the most fundamental level,
civil wars' protracted nature stems from the material asymmetry between
the incumbent and the insurgents, their tendency to become
internationalized, and the limited space of compromise they
involve]{.underline}**. The essay has also highlighted the role of their
factionalized as well as personalized nature as barriers to a negotiated
settlement. Given the immense physical destruction protracted civil wars
entail, they are often reduced to irrational and meaningless conflicts.
However, such views disregard the economic and political incentives that
the continuation of violence presents to both sub-state actors and the
state itself. The structural aspects of intrastate conflict present
clear barriers to a negotiated settlement, but even in the cases where
it has been reached, it has rarely succeeded in putting a decisive end
to the war. As long as the root causes of civil war: insecurity,
poverty, overpopulation, political exclusion as well as the legacy of
atrocities and cultures of violence, are not addressed, violence
continues, even if it mutates into different forms and occurs between
different parties.

SECTION 1: IS DEMOCRACY FAILING? We examine this question along two key
dimensions: public opinion and institutional performance. THE AMERICAN
PUBLIC Based on six high-quality surveys conducted in the last year and
a half, support for democracy as the best form of government remains
overwhelming and mostly stable across party lines.\[3\] However, about 1
in 5 Americans have views that make them at least open to, if not
outright supportive of, authoritarianism.\[4\] But there's an important
qualification: Americans distinguish sharply between democracy in
principle and in practice. There is near-universal agreement that our
system is not working well---in particular, that it is not delivering
the results people want. This is troubling because most people value
democracy for its fruits, not just its roots.\[5\] Given that situation,
it is not surprising that public support is very high for fundamental
change in our political system to make the system work better. There is
no party of the status quo in contemporary America: both sides want
changes, but they disagree about the direction of change. Unfortunately,
about 6 in 10 Americans do not think that the system can change.\[6\]
And because it has not changed despite growing dysfunction, polarization
has led to legislative gridlock, which has generated rising support for
unfettered executive action to carry out the people's will. - Center for
Effective Public Management Senior Fellow - Governance Studies
**[[Democracy means the rule of the people, but Americans do not fully
agree about who belongs to the people]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although
there are areas of agreement across partisan and ideological lines, some
in our nation hold that to be "truly" American, you must believe in God,
identify as Christian, and be born in the United States.\[7\] **[[In a
period of increasing]{.underline}]{.mark}** immigration and religious
**[[pluralism, these divisions can become
dangerous.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Disagreements about who is truly
American are part of a broader cleavage in American
culture]{.underline}. 70% of Republicans believe that America's culture
and way of life have changed for the worse since the 1950s, while 63% of
Democrats believe that they have changed for the better.\[8\] Strong
majorities of Republicans agree that "Things have changed so much that I
often feel like a stranger in my own county," that "Today, America is in
danger of losing its culture and identity," and that "the American way
of life needs to be protected for foreign influences." Majorities of
Democrats reject these propositions. [Support for political violence is
significant. In February 2021, 39% of Republicans, 31% of Independents,
and 17% of Democrats agreed that "if elected leaders will not protect
America, the people must do it themselves, even if it requires violent
actions]{.underline}." In November, 30% of Republicans, 17% of
Independents, and 11% of Democrats agreed that they might have to resort
to violence in order to save our country."\[9\] While public support for
many of the reforms in federal compromise legislation is strong, there
is a divide in the electorate on what they view as the largest problem
in our current system.\[10\] In September, only 36% believed that "rules
that make it too difficult for eligible citizens to vote" constituted
the largest problem for our elections, compared to 45% who identified
"rules that are not strict enough to prevent illegal votes from being
cast" as the largest problem. The conclusion we draw from this quick
review of public opinion is that **[[if democracy fails in
America]{.underline}]{.mark}**, it will not be because a majority of
Americans is demanding a non-democratic form of government**[[. It will
be because an organized, purposeful minority seizes strategic positions
within the system and subverts the substance of democracy while
retaining its shell]{.underline}]{.mark}**---while the majority isn't
well organized, or doesn't care enough, to resist. As we show in a later
section, the possibility that this will occur is far from remote.
AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS A second way of considering whether democracy is
failing is to look at the institutions of government. Successful
democratic systems are not designed for governments composed of ethical
men and women who are only interested in the public good. If leaders
were always virtuous there would be no need for checks and balances. The
Founding Fathers understood this. They designed a system to protect
minority points of view, to protect us from leaders inclined to lie,
cheat and steal, and (paradoxically) to protect the majority against
minorities who are determined to subvert the constitutional order.
During the Trump presidency, the formal institutional "guardrails" of
democracy---Congress, the federalist system, the Courts, the
bureaucracy, and the press---held firm against enormous pressure. At the
same time, there is evidence that the informal norms of conduct that
shape the operation of these institutions have weakened significantly,
making them more vulnerable to future efforts to subvert them.\[11\]
[There is no guarantee that our constitutional democracy will survive
another sustained---and likely better-organized---assault in the years
to come]{.underline}. We begin with the good news about our
institutions. Former President Trump did not succeed in materially
weakening the powers of the Congress.\[12\] He did not try to disband
Congress, and while he often fought that institution, it fought back.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) had no trouble confronting him,
and Democrats brought impeachment charges against him not once but
twice. Although speculation was rampant, in the end then-Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell (R-KY) did not block either trial. While former Leader
McConnell and allies have been called former President Trump's lapdogs,
on virtually all domestic policy issues they have acted like almost any
Republican majority would act, and on foreign policy former Leader
McConnell neither stopped nor punished Republican senators who tried to
constrain Trump when they thought he was wrong.\[13\] The American
system is a federalist system. The Constitution distributes power
between the federal government and the state government, codified in the
10th Amendment to the Constitution. States have repeatedly and
successfully exercised their power against former President Trump,
especially in two areas, COVID-19 and voting.\[14\] Despite Mr. Trump's
attempts to pressure the nation's governors and other state officials
into doing what he wanted, he did not inflict lasting damage on the
federalist system, and the states are no weaker---perhaps even
stronger---than they were before his presidency. Citizens now understand
that in a crisis, states are the ones who control things that are
important to them like shutdown orders and vaccine distribution.
DEMOCRACY In the spring of 2020 then-President Trump, anxious to get
past COVID in time for his re-election campaign, was pushing hard for
states to open up early. Only a few complied, while many---including
some Republican governors---ignored him. Seeing that the governors were
not scared of him, Mr. Trump then threatened to withhold medical
equipment based on states' decisions about opening up. He came up
against the Supreme Court's interpretation of the 10th Amendment, which
prevents the president from conditioning federal aid on the basis of
governors' acquiescing to a president's demands.\[15\] **[[The
guardrails between the federal government and the states also held when
it came to Mr. Trump's campaign to reverse the 2020 election
results]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In Georgia, the Republican Secretary of
State Brad Raffensperger, a stalwart Republican and Trump supporter,
certified election results in spite of personal calls and threats from
the president. In Michigan, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mike
Shirkey and Republican House Speaker Lee Chatfield did not give in to
Trump's attempts to get them to diverge from the process of choosing
electors. One of the hallmarks of failing democracies is a weak judicial
system under heavy political control. But under assault from
then-President Trump, the judiciary remained independent despite his
repeated attempts to win in the courts what he could not win at the
ballot box. President Trump-appointed judges often made decisions that
thwarted Mr. Trump's attempts to overturn the results. In fact, after
the election Mr. Trump's team and allies brought 62 lawsuits and won
exactly one.\[16\] (The others he either dropped or lost.) Many of those
decisions were handed down by Republican judges.\[17\] Perhaps former
President Trump's biggest disappointment was the Supreme Court's
decision not to hear election challenges concerning states he claimed he
had won.\[18\] A free press is an essential element of a healthy
democracy. Former President Trump spent four years using the bully
pulpit of the presidency to mock the press, calling them names and "the
enemy of the people" and referring to outlets he does not like as
"failing." He revoked the press credentials of reporters he did not
like. (The courts restored them.) Nevertheless, reporters were not
afraid to call out his lies. With Mr. Trump out of office for months
now, no major news outlets have gone broke. Few are afraid to criticize
former President Trump or his supporters. **[[The free press is still
fundamentally free]{.underline}]{.mark}** (although President Trump
undoubtably contributed to some decline in public trust of the media,
which in turn weakens its oversight and accountability functions). Its
financial and structural problems, most of which are attributable to the
challenges of internet age, predated Mr. Trump. Some argue that former
President Trump increased distrust in the media but, as polling
indicates, the lack of trust in media declined to less than fifty
percent in the first decade of the 21st century and has stayed in the
low forties in recent years.\[19\] One final point: democracies often
fail when their military sides with anti-democratic insurgents. But
**[in the United States, the tradition of civil control over the armed
forces remains strong]{.underline}**---especially within the military.
After the chaos in Lafayette Park last June, when Mark Milley, the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared with then-President
Trump in military fatigues, Mr. Milley and other top military leaders
went out of their way to reaffirm this tradition, which is drilled into
all officers throughout their careers. [A military coup is the least
likely way for democracy in America to end.\[]{.underline}20\] SO WHY
ARE WE WORRIED? Although scholars and pundits have long chronicled with
regret the rise of partisan polarization and the decline of
congressional effectiveness**[[, concern about the outright failure of
American democracy was rare before the rise of Donald Trump. Never
before in American history have we had a candidate, not to mention a
president, who disparaged the integrity of the electoral
system]{.underline}]{.mark}** and who hinted repeatedly during his
election that he would not accept the results of the election if he
lost. This behavior began during the Republican primaries and continued
in advance of the 2016 election, which he won, and the 2020 election,
which he lost.\[21\] It built to a crescendo that exploded on January 6,
2021, when supporters, called to Washington for a "Stop the Steal"
rally, marched to the Capitol, attacked law enforcement officers,
vandalized offices, and breached the Senate gallery where the electoral
college vote was supposed to be taking place. The non-stop attacks on
American elections were part of a broader attack on the truth. Any story
Mr. Trump and his supporters disliked became "fake news," creating,
slowly but surely, an alternate universe that encompassed everything
from the integrity of the election to public health guidelines for the
COVID pandemic. The very existence of a sizeable number of citizens who
cannot agree on facts is an enormous threat to democracy. As the Yale
historian Timothy Snyder points out in his 2018 book, The Road to
Unfreedom, authoritarians like Vladimir Putin have no use for truth or
for the facts, because they use and disseminate only what will help them
achieve and maintain power.\[22\] As our colleague Jonathan Rauch argues
in The Constitution of Knowledge, disinformation and the war on reality
have reached "epistemic" proportions.\[23**[[\] Even though
constitutional processes prevailed and Mr. Trump is no longer president,
he and his followers continue to weaken American democracy by convincing
many Americans to distrust the results of the
election]{.underline}]{.mark}**. About three-quarters of rank-and-file
Republicans believe that there was massive fraud in 2020 and Joe Biden
was not legitimately elected president. "A 'Politico'/Morning Consult
survey found that more than one-third of American voters feel the 2020
election should be overturned, including three out of five
Republicans."\[24\] The aftermath of the 2020 election revealed
structural weaknesses in the institutions designed to safeguard the
integrity of the electoral process. A focus of concern is the Electoral
Count Act of 1887, which was adopted in response to the contested
election of 1876. This legislation is so ambiguously drafted that one of
former President Trump's lawyers used it as the basis of a memorandum
arguing that former Vice President Pence, whom the Constitution
designates as the chair of the meeting at which the Electoral College
ballots are counted, had the right to ignore certified slates of
electors the states had sent to Washington. If Mr. Pence had yielded to
then-President Trump's pressure to act in this manner, the election
would have been thrown into chaos and the Constitution placed in
jeopardy.\[25\] Recently, former President Trump's assault on the
integrity of the 2020 election has taken a new and dangerous turn.
Rather than focusing on federal government, his supporters have focused
on the obscure world of election machinery. Republican majorities in
state legislatures are passing laws making it harder to vote and
weakening the ability of election officials to do their jobs. In many
states, especially closely contested ones such as Arizona and Georgia,
Mr. Trump's supporters are trying to defeat incumbents who upheld the
integrity of the election and replace them with the former President's
supporters.\[26\] At the local level, death threats are being made
against Democratic and Republican election administrators, with up to
30% of election officials surveyed saying they are concerned for their
safety.\[27\] As seasoned election administrators retire or just quit,
Mr. Trump supporters are vying for these obscure but pivotal positions.
In Michigan, for instance, the Washington Post reports that there is
intense focus on the boards charged with certifying the vote at the
county level. Republicans who voted against former President Trump's
efforts to alter the vote count are being replaced. And most dangerous
of all, some states are considering laws that would bypass the
long-established institutions for certifying the vote-count and give
partisan legislatures the authority to determine which slate of electors
will represent them in the Electoral College**[[. American democracy is
thus under assault from the ground up. The]{.underline}]{.mark}** most
recent systematic attack on state and local election machinery is much
more dangerous than the chaotic statements of a disorganized former
president. A movement that relied on Mr. Trump's organizational skills
would pose no threat to constitutional institutions. A movement inspired
by him with a clear objective and a detailed plan to achieve it would be
another matter altogether. **[[The chances that this threat will
materialize over the next few years are high and
rising.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The evidence suggests that Mr. Trump is
preparing once again to seek the Republican presidential
nomination---and that he will win the nomination if he tries for it.
Even if he decides not to do so, the party's base will insist on a
nominee who shares the former president's outlook and is willing to
participate in a plan to win the presidency by **[[subverting the
results of state elections if necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The
consequences could include an extended period of political and social
instability, and an outbreak of mass violence.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
