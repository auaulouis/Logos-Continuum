MADRID --- Turkey isn't the only "problem child" of the NATO family at
this year's annual summit. The [[Hungar\[y\]]{.mark}ian government [is
the **lone objector blocking**]{.mark} the establishment of a Center for
[Democra\[cy\]]{.mark}tic Resilience [within NATO]{.mark}, a yearslong
effort by Rep.]{.underline} GERRY CONNOLLY (D-Va.), who serves as
president of NATO's Parliamentary Assembly. It can sound like a tale out
of the U.S. Senate, where one member can grind the chamber's business to
a halt. [In NATO, **[all member-nations must consent]{.mark}** to a
decree in the Strategic Concept or expansion of the
alliance.]{.underline} The center, as billed, would advise governments
on best practices for maintaining and building a 21st-century democracy.
[**[Hungary's anti-democratic slide]{.mark}** is no secret, so it's not
necessarily a surprise that its government [is **objecting to**]{.mark}
the creation of such an entity within **[NATO]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
VIKTOR [[ORBÁN]{.mark}, Hungary's DONALD TRUMP-endorsed prime minister,
[has]{.mark} engineered crackdowns on the press and **[undermined
election laws]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the independent judiciary,
leading critics to [[dub him an **authoritarian**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
"With the horror we're witnessing in Ukraine, how could you not want to
build democratic architecture within NATO to counter what we are
experiencing in Ukraine?" Connolly told NatSec Daily here on day one of
the summit. "You can't argue the two aren't related. Of course, they're
related. What do you think Putin is fighting against?" Connolly, who
leads what is effectively NATO's legislative body, is pleading with
Hungary to harken back to its roots --- specifically, the 1956 Hungarian
Revolution, which was an effort to push back against Soviet influence.
"1956 was in some ways eerily like Ukraine in the aspirations being
represented in the revolt of Soviet occupation in Hungary. There had
been an uprising in East Germany prior to that, but that was the first
big break in the Soviet bloc," said Connolly, who once worked for
then-Sen. JOE BIDEN on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "So my
hope is Hungary will remind itself of its own history \[and\] return to
its own struggle for freedom over many generations." The purpose of a
Center for Democratic Resilience is "to serve as a resource and a
clearinghouse of best practices and cross-fertilization on democratic
benchmarks available to member, partner, and aspirant states, upon
request," according to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. Connolly has
referred to it as NATO's "sin of omission," and has cited the Jan. 6
attack on the U.S. Capitol and efforts by pro-Trump forces to overturn
the 2020 election as evidence that democracy is fragile. Back home,
Connolly and Rep. MIKE TURNER (R-Ohio) led House passage of a resolution
supporting the establishment of such a center within NATO, though 63
Republicans opposed the effort. But in order for it to actually happen,
Hungary needs to drop its opposition. Connolly declined to describe the
nature of Budapest's objections, but noted that the rest of NATO's
members were skittish about his proposal when he first unveiled it and
eventually came around. "I'm ever the optimist. But I'll tell you this,
we will not give up," Connolly said. "We will stick with this and pursue
this until it comes to fruition."

### AT Russia/Say No

#### Hungry says no -- their economy is completely dependent on Russia imports.

Tim **Gosling**, 7-24-**2022**, Tim Gosling is a Prague-based journalist
who has covered the Central European region for several years. He has
contributed to Politico Europe, Deutsche Welle and the Financial Times,
among other publications, and also provided analysis on the region for
the Economist Intelligence Unit and IHS Markit.,Hungary's energy
dalliance with Russia,
POLITICO,https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-energy-dalliance-with-russia,
jkap

Many Central and Eastern European countries are trying to cut their
energy ties to Russia, but not [[Hungary]{.mark}, which is chasing a new
gas deal. The reason? It\'s crucial to the ruling Fidesz party\'s hold
on power. "[Low energy prices]{.mark} for households [are a key plank
for this government]{.mark}," said Pál Ságvári, Hungary's
ambassador-at-large for energy security. He confirmed that [Budapest is
preparing to discuss a new long-term gas contract with
Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline}, adding: "It's now a buyers' market. It's a
good time to start talks." Government officials in Budapest said that
Russia, which is facing increased competition from liquefied natural
gas, is keen to do a deal. [[Moscow]{.mark} [is]{.mark} also widely
viewed as [sympathetic]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the [Hungarian]{.mark}
[government]{.mark}'s need for a bargain.]{.underline} "Cheap energy was
a central focus of Orbán\'s first term" --- Ákos Hadházy, independent MP
[[Cheap energy prices]{.mark} [are]{.mark} a [key]{.mark} political
buttress [for]{.mark} Hungarian Prime Minister [Viktor Orbán.]{.mark}
Ahead of Hungary's 2014 parliamentary election, energy bills dropped
into household post boxes included how much cash Fidesz policies had
saved consumers.]{.underline} The government had just implemented price
cuts that reduced household energy bills by a third --- a step that
prompted many foreign-owned energy companies to sell their Hungarian
assets to the state. Fidesz won a thumping majority in the election.
"Cheap energy was a central focus of Orbán\'s first term," said Ákos
Hadházy, a former member of Fidesz who is now an independent MP. "This
caused big losses for providers but of course it was very popular." The
price cuts didn't end in 2014, and Hungarian household gas and power
prices are now the lowest in the EU. "The government's priority goals
include maintaining the security of energy supply and preserving the
results of the cut in utility costs," Zoltán Kovács, state secretary for
public diplomacy and relations, told POLITICO. "The energy expenditure
of families must not increase." Russia\'s helping hand
[[Maintaining]{.mark} this system requires competitively priced imports,
and [Russia\'s assistance is crucial]{.mark}. [Russia is Hungary\'s
dominant supplier of both gas and nuclear]{.mark} --- [together
accounting for about half of its energy]{.mark} mix; by 2030 they are
expected to grow to about 60 percent]{.underline}, according to the
government's energy strategy. "The logic is that Russia provides cheap
energy and Orbán causes trouble for the EU and NATO," said Tamás
Pletser, an energy analyst at Erste Bank in Budapest, explaining why
Russia would be interested in a relationship with a country often at
odds with most of its fellow EU members. Russia supplies practically all
of the 8 billion to 10 billion cubic meters of gas Hungary consumes
annually. In 2015, Gazprom cut Hungary\'s gas import price by about 25
percent, said Attila Holoda, who was deputy secretary of state for
energy in 2012 and now runs Aurora Energy, a consultancy. That wasn't
the only sweet deal from Russia. With Hungary's long-term gas delivery
contract expiring, Gazprom in 2013 waived take-or-pay clauses --- which
require a client to pay for a certain volume of gas whether used or not
and which have been a source of tension with other customers in the
region. That allowed the Russian energy giant to continue delivering gas
to Hungary under the contract until the end of 2018. [Fidesz remains
acutely aware that its cap on household bills is a vital component of
its political success]{.underline} A temporary deal has kept supplies
flowing since, but Budapest now needs to open talks on a new permanent
agreement, Ságvári said. However, any long-term agreement with Gazprom
would go against the grain in a region where most countries are looking
for other energy sources to reduce their dependence on Russia. Hungary
remains focused on price, and analysts expect Budapest to secure a
bargain; Fidesz also has fewer geopolitical worries about Moscow\'s
intentions than other former communist countries in Central Europe.
Facing increased competition from LNG, Gazprom is scrambling to secure
market share in Europe. The coronavirus crisis and oil price crash will
likely only strengthen the customer's hand. [Critics still worry that
[Hungary]{.mark} [will]{.mark} [be]{.mark} [dependent]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} [Moscow]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [a]{.mark} [major]{.mark}
[chunk]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [its]{.mark} [energy]{.mark} [mix.]{.mark}
The new contract will ensure stable prices for households, said
Ságvári.]{.underline} The less politically sensitive commercial sector
will depend on the liberalized market, where suppliers are free to
negotiate prices with customers. Political cash [Cheap [Russian gas has
also helped fund Fidesz's political campaigns]{.mark}. In 2015,
state-owned utility MVM's net profit was 14.7 billion forints (€42
million). When Russia's price cut took effect the following year,
earnings boomed to 48.4 billion forints.]{.underline} Ahead of the 2018
election, MVM donated 500 million forints to Civil Unity Forum, a
government-linked NGO that had attacked opposition politicians and the
EU. The Kremlin is also involved in MVM's nuclear operations. [Russian
state nuclear agency Rosatom is the lead contractor on the €12 billion
project to expand the Paks nuclear plant, where [Moscow is providing 80
percent of the financing. Ságvári said the government plans to deepen
its reliance]{.mark} on Paks. "Nuclear is an important backbone of the
energy mix]{.underline}, and the strategy is to push it to 40 percent as
part of the decarbonization drive," he said. "We believe we got a good
deal from Russia." [Critics, including Brussels and the U.S., still
worry that whatever the price tag for Paks and for Russian gas, Hungary
will be dependent on Moscow for a major chunk of its energy
mix.]{.underline} But Fidesz remains acutely aware that its cap on
household bills is a vital component of its political success, and
insists it will continue to do whatever it takes to keep cheap energy
flowing to voters. Low power bills are an implicit bargain with voters,
said Michael Labelle, Jean Monnet Chair in Energy and Innovation
Strategies at Central European University. \"A change in government will
result in more expensive gas."

#### Hungary will not escalate against Russia

**Coakley 22**

\[Amanda Coakley ; 3-22-2022; \"The Exception to Europe\'s United Front
Against Russia\"; Time;

[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[European Union]{.mark} that answered
Russia's invasion of Ukraine with an economic war against Moscow,
[Hungary stands apart]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [While Orban
stopped short of vetoing E.U. sanctions on Russia, he has said Budapest
will block any E.U. sanctions on Russian oil and gas, and refuted calls
to stop the expansion of the Paks Nuclear Plant, which is being funded
by Russia's nuclear power company, Rosatom]{.underline}. Arguing that
Hungarians should not be faced with higher bills because of energy
sanctions, Orban believes he is skilled enough to navigate a
relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

That irks the European Union---which in many ways is nothing new. Over
the course of Orban's 12 year tenure, Brussels has been at odds with
Hungary for its increasingly undemocratic tendencies, including
weakening the country's free press and undermining its independent
judiciary. So fraught was Budapest's relationship with the E.U. that in
December 2020 the European Parliament approved a new "rule of law
conditionality" mechanism that linked E.U. funds to member states'
respect for democracy.

But the Ukraine invasion brought a new measure of Orban's defiance:
[[Hungary now finds itself **isolated**]{.mark} even from
Poland]{.underline}, the country that joined it in wreaking havoc on the
E.U.'s fundamental values, including by jointly launching a legal
challenge against the rule of law mechanism (their case was rejected by
the European Court of Justice, the bloc's top court, in early February).

[[Russia]{.mark} has long [tested]{.mark} the limits of Poland and
[Hungary's "illiberal alliance]{.mark}." While [Orban]{.mark} has
**[courted]{.mark} [Putin]{.mark}** **[since]{.mark}** before his return
to power in **[2010]{.mark}**, the man often called Poland's most
powerful politician, Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczynski, has never
ceased to wax lyrical about the threat the Kremlin poses to the
West.]{.underline} When Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014,
[**[Orban]{.mark}** [offered]{.mark} **[no]{.mark} [strong
opinions]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the [conflict]{.mark} [and]{.mark} only
[reluctantly]{.mark} [supported the E.U.'s sanctions on
Moscow]{.mark},]{.underline} arguing that "[[Russia's]{.mark}
[exclusion]{.mark} from Europe [is]{.mark} [not reasonable]{.mark};
security in the region can only be achieved with Russia]{.underline}."
Meanwhile, Poland stood firm in its support for Ukraine and called on
Europe to take the Russian security threat seriously.

In the infamous Transylvania speech announcing Hungary in 2014 as an
"illiberal state," [[Orban]{.mark} also [called]{.mark}
[Russia]{.mark}---along with China, Singapore, India, and Turkey---a
[model for Hungarian society]{.mark}]{.underline}. None of this sat well
with Warsaw but it wasn't until Putin himself visited Budapest in 2015
and was allowed to state his position on Ukraine that tensions between
the two came to boiling point. When Orbán later visited Poland,
Kaczynski, whose Law and Justice Party (known by the Polish initials
PiS) was still in opposition, refused to meet him. Over time these
frustrations faded as the focus between the two moved to undermining the
E.U. But they were never forgotten---and now demonstrate how much of an
outlier Orban has made Budapest in the largest European conflict since
World War II.

Though Hungary has thrown open its eastern frontier to Ukrainians
fleeing the Russian invasion, unlike Poland it has refused Kyiv lethal
aid and prevented weapons to Ukraine from being transported via its
territory. [Once again [Orban]{.mark} has [framed]{.mark}
[Russian]{.mark} [aggression]{.mark} in Ukraine [as]{.mark} an
[issue]{.mark} [beyond his jurisdiction]{.mark} and promoted so-called
"strategic calmness." With elections on April 3 and the Prime Minister
likely to win his fourth consecutive term in office, his Fidesz party is
campaigning on keeping Hungary "out of the war."]{.underline} Hungary's
six-party united opposition has highlighted Fidesz's close affiliations
to the Kremlin, but that may not matter in Hungary's rural heartlands
where both support for Orban and fears of regional instability run
strong.

"Every step Orbán takes ahead of the elections is focused on winning,"
Pál Dániel Rényi, a Hungarian journalist and author tells TIME.
"[Hungary is heading into a massive recession, the [Prime]{.mark}
[Minister]{.mark} [is **power obsessed**]{.mark}, and he isn't going to
do anything that won't work in his favour.]{.underline}" If the price is
isolation even from Poland that appears to be fine with Orban. On March
23 Hungarian President János Áder was due to unveil a statue in the
southern Polish town of Bochnia to mark Polish-Hungarian friendship day.
His trip was reportedly postponed because Poland's President Andrzej
Duda didn't want to appear alongside him, given Hungary's ambiguous
stance on the Russian invasion.
