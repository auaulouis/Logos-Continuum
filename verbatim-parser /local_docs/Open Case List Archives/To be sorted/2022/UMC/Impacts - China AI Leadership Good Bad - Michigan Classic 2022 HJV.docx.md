Nick Chaillan, the U.S. Department of State's first-ever software
chief, [resigned](https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/576213-former-pentagon-official-says-china-has-won-artificial-intelligence) in
September 2021. He claimed that the United States had "no competing
fighting chance against China in the next 15 to 20 years."

[[China is currently winning the race toward global dominance in
a]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial [[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence. But
how did China get so far ahead?

AI technology will play a major role in driving economic growth and
national security in the foreseeable future. China's AI investment is a
new development that only started to gain traction in the past several
years.
In [2015,](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy) China
was still behind the United States, along with French and German AI
firms as well. However, one event in 2016 pushed China on its upward
slope toward AI supremacy. DeepMind, a leading AI application company,
created a machine that [beat the world
champion](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy) in
Go, the world's most complex board game. 

By this time, many American companies had already constructed machines
capable of beating chess world champions. However, Go is thousands of
times more complex than chess, so many were confident that it would be
impossible to create such a machine. Yet, China did it.

Skepticism about the potential of China's AI technology triggered a
reaction from [President [Xi]{.underline}
Jinping](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy);
contrary to what was being said, he [declared that China would become a
leader in AI.]{.underline} In the years that
followed, [[[Beijing](https://nypost.com/2021/10/11/pentagon-software-chief-nicolas-chaillan-resigns/) prioritized
a]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial [[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence and
cyber capabilities over traditional military spending, [[leading to an
aggressive approach in dominating]{.mark} the [AI
industry]{.mark}]{.underline} with a specific focus on surveillance and
data collection. Xi wanted major tech companies, instead of government
agencies, to lead this innovation. He appointed [five national
champions](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy) --- [Alibaba
for smart
cities](https://fortune.com/2021/07/02/china-artificial-intelligence-ai-business-ecosystems-tencent-baidu-alibaba/);
Baidu for autonomous driving; iFlytek for voice recognition; SenseTime
for facial recognition; and Tencent for computer vision for medical
imaging. Xi also [set
targets](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy) that
would ensure China's dominance in AI technology and other related
sectors by 2030. 

And just one year after Xi set his targets and appointed AI leaders,
[China saw major advancements in its race against the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. Investments in Chinese AI
startups [overtook
investments](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy) in
American AI startups; [[China filed **2.5 times more patents** than the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [for AI]{.mark} technologies [by
2018]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [[in 2020 China had **three times** the
number of college graduates in the computer sciences than the United
States did.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[WeChat](https://www.vox.com/recode/22725044/china-ai-race-pentagon-wechat),
which was developed by Tencent, became the world's largest mobile app in
2018 with over 1 billion monthly users. The app can collect major
quantities of data thanks to government support and Newark privacy
policies. 

[Today, [China dominates the various sectors of AI
technolog]{.mark}y.]{.underline} In financial technology, Apple Pay in
the United States has [22 million
users](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy).
On the other hand, Tencent's WeChat Pay has [900 million
users](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy) in
China and greater technological capabilities than Apple Pay, which
allows the app to generate vast amounts of data about consumer behaviors
that Chinese systems can then use to develop more advanced technology.
Moreover, in 2018 Chinese consumers spent [\$19
trillion](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy) through
mobile payments, while the United States is still struggling to hit [\$1
trillion](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy). 

[In [facial recognition]{.mark}, Washington essentially dropped
out]{.underline} of the race due to privacy concerns and the ethics of
how this technology could be deployed. [Beijing]{.underline}, however,
[claimed the [top 5
spots](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy) in
the 2018 international competition for facial recognition]{.underline}.
Chinese firms individually control a third of the world's security
cameras, can capture high-definition color images with minimal light,
and specialize in thermal imaging. Together, they work with Beijing to
perfect this technology for both profit and security purposes. 

[China is also beating the United States in [speech]{.mark}
technology]{.underline}. [iFlytek](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy),
the world's top voice recognition company, has a user base of almost
double the number of  Siri users, with [700 million
people](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy) using
iFlytek. And once again, [Chinese teams claimed three of the top five
spots]{.underline}, including first place, at Stanford University's
international competition for machine reading comprehension. 

Of the [world's [top five [commercial drone
brands]{.mark}](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy)[,]{.mark}
three of them are Chinese brands]{.underline}, while just one is
American, with Shenzhen drone company DJI controlling 70% of the global
market of drone technology.

Additionally, 5G infrastructure is essential for a future that runs on
AI technology. China has two firms within the top four global leaders
for providing this technology, while the United States. has none.
[Huawei, a Chinese firm, is the world's leading supplier of [5G
infrastructure and tech]{.mark}nology,
occupying [28%](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy) of
the global market share]{.underline} --- equalling the combined shares
of its two biggest competitors.

However, many consider China far behind the United States when it comes
to AI ethics and governance. American social culture and political
culture values privacy over security and fosters distrust in authority
and the government. American values have led to early debates and
conversations on how to regulate AI and its algorithms. These
discussions have made it difficult for the United States to
significantly advance its AI technology. 

On the other hand, AI ethics have not been as large of an issue in
China. Public opinions in China about privacy have allowed AI to quickly
develop. In fact, it wasn't until October 2021 that China issued
its [first
guidelines](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3150789/chinese-ai-gets-ethical-guidelines-first-time-aligning-beijings-goal?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Recode%2010.13.2021&utm_term=Recode) on
AI ethics, prioritizing user rights and data control.

[China]{.underline} is not just trying to gain global dominance in AI
technology but [is currently succeeding and dominating all aspects of
the field]{.underline}. AI will have the potential to greatly affect
commerce, national security and general society in the next couple of
decades.

If it wants to keep up, the United States needs to make a decision about
whether it will invest in AI technology and begin to seriously compete
with China, or continue to waiver on AI and prove Nick Chaillan right.

#### Chinese development of AI is key -- western led AI innovation will lead to [economic devastation]{.underline} and [imperialist wars]{.underline}

**Feng 18 --** Professor of law at Tsinghua University and one of
China's most prominent legal scholars. He spoke at the Berggruen
Institute's China Center workshop on artificial intelligence in 2018 in
Beijing. (Xiang, The Washington post, "AI will spell the end of
capitalism", 5-3-2018,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/05/03/end-of-capitalism/)//mj

BEIJING --- [The]{.underline} [**most momentous challenge**]{.underline}
facing socio-economic systems [today is the arrival of
a]{.underline}rtificial [i]{.underline}ntelligence. [**If AI remains
under** the control of **market forces, it will**]{.underline}
inexorably [**result in** a **super-rich oligopoly** of data
billionaires who reap the wealth created by robots that displace human
labor, leaving massive unemployment in their wake.]{.underline}

But [**China's** socialist market **economy could provide a solution**
to this.]{.underline} [If AI rationally allocates resources through big
data analysis, and if robust feedback loops can supplant the
imperfections of "the invisible hand" while fairly sharing the vast
wealth it creates, a planned economy that actually works could at last
be achievable.]{.underline}

[The more AI advances into a general-purpose tech]{.underline}nology
[that permeates]{.underline} every corner of [life]{.underline}, [the
less sense it makes to allow it to remain in private hands that serve
the interests of the few]{.underline} instead of the many. More than
anything else, the inevitability of mass unemployment and the demand for
universal welfare will drive the idea of socializing or nationalizing
AI.

Marx's dictum, "From each according to their abilities, to each
according to their needs," needs an update for the 21st century: "From
the inability of an AI economy to provide jobs and a living wage for
all, to each according to their needs."

Even at this early stage, [the **idea that digital capitalism will**
somehow **make social welfare a priority** has already **proven to be a
fairytale.**]{.underline} [The billionaires of Google and
Apple]{.underline}, [who have been depositing]{.underline} company
[profits]{.underline} in [offshore]{.underline} havens to avoid
taxation, [are hardly paragons of social responsibility]{.underline}.
[The ongoing scandal around Facebook's business model]{.underline},
[which puts profitability above responsible citizenship, is yet another
example of how in digital capitalism, **private companies only look
after their own interests** at the **expense of the rest of
society.**]{.underline}

One can readily see where this is all headed once technological
unemployment accelerates. "Our responsibility is to our shareholders,"
the robot owners will say. "We are not an employment agency or a
charity."

These companies have been able to get away with their social
irresponsibility because [the legal system]{.underline} and its
loopholes [in the West are geared to **protect private property above
all else.**]{.underline} Of course, in China, we have big privately
owned Internet companies like Alibaba and Tencent. But
[unlike]{.underline} in [the West,]{.underline} [they are **monitored by
the state** and **do not regard themselves as** above or **beyond social
control.**]{.underline}

[It is the very pervasiveness of AI that will spell the end of market
dominance.]{.underline} The market may reasonably if unequally function
if industry creates employment opportunities for most people. But when
industry only produces joblessness, as robots take over more and more,
there is no good alternative but for the state to step in. As AI invades
economic and social life, all private law-related issues will soon
become public ones. More and more, [regulation of private companies will
become a necessity to maintain some semblance of stability in societies
roiled by constant innovation.]{.underline}

I consider this historical process a step closer to a planned market
economy. [Laissez-faire capitalism as we have known it can lead nowhere
but to a dictatorship of AI oligarchs who gather rents because the
intellectual property they own rules over the means of
production.]{.underline} **[On a global scale]{.underline}**, [it is
easy to envision this **unleashed digital capitalism leading to a battle
between robots** for market share that will surely **end as disastrously
as** the **imperialist wars did** in an earlier era.]{.underline}

For the sake of social well-being and security, individuals and [private
companies should not be allowed to possess any exclusive]{.underline}
cutting-edge technology or core [AI]{.underline} platforms. **[Like
nuclear]{.underline}** [and biochemical]{.underline}
**[weapons]{.underline}**, as long as they exist, [nothing other than a
strong]{.underline} and stable [state can **ensure society's
safety**.]{.underline} If we don't nationalize AI, we could sink into a
dystopia reminiscent of the early misery of industrialization, with its
satanic mills and street urchins scrounging for a crust of bread.

The dream of communism is the elimination of wage labor. If AI is bound
to serve society instead of private capitalists, it promises to do so by
freeing an overwhelming majority from such drudgery while creating
wealth to sustain all.

If the state controls the market, instead of digital capitalism
controlling the state, true communist aspirations will be achievable.
And because AI increasingly enables the management of complex systems by
processing massive amounts of information through intensive feedback
loops, it presents, for the first time, a real alternative to the market
signals that have long justified laissez-faire ideology --- and all the
ills that go with it.

Going forward, **[China's socialist market economy]{.underline}**,
wh[ich aims to harness the fruits of production for the whole population
and not just]{.underline} a sliver of [elites]{.underline} operating in
their own self-centered interests, [can lead the way toward this **new
stage of human development**.]{.underline}

[If properly regulated i]{.underline}n this way, [we should
celebrate]{.underline}, not fear, [the advent of AI]{.underline}. [If it
is brought under social control]{.underline}, [it will finally free
workers from peddling their time and sweat only to enrich those at the
top.]{.underline} The communism of the future ought to adopt a new
slogan: "Robots of the world, unite!"

https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/quantumblack/our-insights/the-next-frontier-for-ai-in-china-could-add-600-billion-to-its-economy)

By 2030, AI could disrupt transportation and other key sectors in China,
adding significant economic value---but only if strategic cooperation
and capability building occur across multiple dimensions[. In the past
decade, [China]{.mark} has [built a solid foundation to support its AI
economy and made significant contributions to AI
globally]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Stanford University's AI
Index]{.underline}, which assesses AI advancements worldwide across
various metrics in research, development, and economy, [ranks China
among the top three countries for global AI vibrancy.]{.underline} 1 [On
research, for example, **[China produced]{.mark}** about [**one-third**
of both AI journal papers and AI citations worldwide]{.mark} in
2021.]{.underline} [In economic investment, China [accounted for]{.mark}
nearly [**one-fifth** of global private investment funding]{.mark} in
2021, attracting \$17 billion for AI start-ups. 2 Today, [AI adoption is
high in China in finance, retail, and high tech]{.mark}, which together
[account for]{.mark} more than [one-third of]{.mark} the [country's AI
market]{.mark}]{.underline} (see sidebar "Five types of AI companies in
China"). 3 In tech, for example, leaders Alibaba and ByteDance, both
household names in China, have become known for their highly
personalized AI-driven consumer apps. In fact, most of the AI
applications that have been widely adopted in China to date have been in
consumer-facing industries, propelled by the world's largest internet
consumer base and the ability to engage with consumers in new ways to
increase customer loyalty, revenue, and market valuations. [So what's
next for AI in China]{.underline}?In the coming decade, our research
indicates that there is [tremendous [opportunity for AI growth in new
sectors]{.mark} in China, including some where innovation and R&D
spending have traditionally lagged global counterparts: automotive,
transportation, and logistics; manufacturing; enterprise software; and
healthcare and life sciences.]{.underline} (See sidebar "About the
research.") In these sectors, we see clusters of use cases where [[AI
can create]{.mark} upwards of **\$600 billion** [in economic value
annually]{.mark}.]{.underline} (To provide a sense of scale, the 2021
gross domestic product in Shanghai, China's most populous city of nearly
28 million, was roughly \$680 billion.) [In some cases, this
[value]{.mark} will come [from]{.mark} [revenue]{.mark} [generated by
AI-enabled offerings]{.mark}, while in other cases, it will be generated
[by cost savings through greater efficiency]{.mark} and
productivity.]{.underline} These clusters are likely to become
battlegrounds for companies in each sector that will help define the
market leaders. Unlocking the full potential of these AI opportunities
typically requires significant investments---in some cases, much more
than leaders might expect---on multiple fronts, including the data and
technologies that will underpin AI systems, [[the **right
talent**]{.mark} **[and organizational mindsets]{.mark}** to build these
systems, [and new business models]{.mark} and partnerships to [create
data ecosystems]{.mark}, **[industry standards, and
regulations]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In our work and [global
research](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/quantumblack/our-insights/global-survey-the-state-of-ai-in-2021),
we find many of these enablers are becoming standard practice among
companies getting the most value from AI. [To [help]{.mark} leaders and
investors **[marshal their resources to accelerate, disrupt, and lead in
AI]{.mark},** we dive into the research, first sharing where the biggest
opportunities lie in each sector and then outlining the core enablers to
be tackled first.]{.underline}

**CCP economic decline leads to multiple scenarios for war**

**Carpenter, 15** \[Ted Galen, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and
a contributing editor at The National Interest, The National Interest,
"Could China\'s Economic Troubles Spark a War?", 9/6/15,
<http://nationalinterest.org/feature/could-chinas-economic-troubles-spark-war-13784?page=2>,
6/24/16\]JRO

Global attention has focused on the plunge in the Shanghai stock market
and mounting evidence that China's economic growth is slowing
dramatically. Moreover, the contagion appears to be spreading,
characterized by extreme volatility and alarming declines in America's
own equity markets. Those worries are compounded because there always
have been doubts about the accuracy of Beijing's official economic
statistics. Even before the current downturn, some outside experts
believed that Chinese officials padded the results, making the country's
performance appear stronger than it actually was. If China is now
teetering on the brink of recession, the political incentives for
officials to conceal the extent of the damage would be quite powerful.
[The focus on the possible wider economic consequences of a severe
Chinese economic slowdown is understandable, since the ramifications
could be extremely unpleasant for the U.S. and global
economies]{.underline}. But [we should also be vigilant about
how]{.underline} such [[economic stress]{.mark} might [affect
Beijing's]{.mark} diplomatic and [military behavior]{.mark}. It is not
unprecedented for a government that feels besieged to attempt to
distract a discontented public by fomenting a foreign policy
crisis.]{.underline} In Henry IV, Shakespeare pithily described that
process as the temptation to "busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels."
[China's leaders likely feel increasingly uncomfortable.]{.underline}
The implicit bargain that has been in place since the onset of
market-oriented reforms in the late 1970s has been that if the public
does not challenge the Communist Party's dominant political position,
the Party will deliver an ever-rising standard of living for the people.
The bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 was a graphic reminder of
what happens if the Party's position is challenged. However, until now,
the economic portion of the bargain seemed secure, characterized by
breathtaking, often double digit, rates of growth. It is uncertain what
happens [[if the Party can no longer maintain its part of the implicit
bargain]{.underline}]{.mark}, but [it is likely that [a dangerous degree
of public discontent will surface]{.mark}]{.underline}. Beijing might
refrain from deliberately provoking a major foreign policy crisis, since
the Chinese economy depends heavily on export markets, and access to
those markets would be jeopardized by war. However, [the **[need to
preserve]{.mark} and strengthen [national unity and distract the
public]{.mark}** from mounting economic troubles is likely to [impel
Chinese leaders to adopt]{.mark} very [hardline policies]{.mark} in at
least three areas.]{.underline} [And all of those situations entail the
danger of miscalculations that could lead to war. One issue is the South
China Sea.]{.underline} Beijing has made extraordinarily broad
territorial claims that encompass some 90 percent of that body of water.
China is pressing its claims with air and naval patrols and the building
of artificial islands. [Those policies have brought Beijing into
acrimonious disputes with]{.underline} neighbors such as [Vietnam and
the Philippines, which have rival territorial claims, and with the
world's leading maritime power, the United States, which resists any
manifestation of Chinese control over [the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea and the crucial commercial lanes that pass through it. The
[conditions are in place for a nasty confrontation]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Chinese leaders have already stressed the country's alleged historical
claims to the area]{.underline}, and made it clear that it will not
tolerate being subjected to humiliation by outside powers. [Such
arguments are designed to gain domestic support by reminding the Chinese
people of the country's long period of weakness and humiliation in the
1800s and early 1900s. A second issue is Taiwan]{.underline}. [Beijing
has long argued that Taiwan is rightfully part of China and was stolen
from the country in the Sino-Japanese war in 1895.]{.underline}
[Although Chinese leaders have exhibited patience regarding the issue of
reunification]{.underline}, [relying in large measure on growing
cross-strait economic ties to entice Taiwan to eventually accept that
outcome]{.underline}, Beijing has also reacted very sharply whenever
Taiwanese officials have pushed an agenda of independence, as during the
administration of Chen Shui-bian from 2000 to 2008. [The danger or
renewed confrontation is rising, since public opinion polls]{.underline}
[indicate that the nominee of Chen's old party, the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party, will be Taiwan's next leader]{.underline}.
[A new [crisis in]{.mark} the [Taiwan]{.mark} Strait [would be]{.mark}
extremely [serious, since the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has
obligated itself to consider any Chinese efforts at coercion as a "grave
breach of the peace"]{.mark} of East Asia]{.underline}. Yet there is
little doubt that there would be widespread domestic support on the
mainland for a stern response by the Beijing government to a Taiwanese
attempt to enhance its de-facto independence. Indeed, there might be
more political danger to the regime if it did not take a strong stance
on that issue. [The third possible arena for crisis is the East China
Sea]{.underline}. [China is increasingly adamant about its claims to the
Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, which are under Japanese control]{.underline}.
[From China's perspective, those islands were stolen by Imperial
Japan]{.underline} at the same time that Tokyo took possession of Taiwan
following the 1895 war. And [ginning up public anger against Japan is
never difficult]{.underline}. China just finished celebrating the 70th
anniversary of the end of World War II, which is touted in China as "the
Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the
World Anti-Fascist War." [Recalling Japan's invasion of China, and the
resulting atrocities, was a prominent theme of]{.underline} the various
[commemorative events]{.underline}. But the animosity is not based
solely on historical grievances[. Anger at Japan over the ongoing East
China Sea dispute and other matters has already produced anti-Japanese
riots in Chinese cities, characterized by attacks on Japanese businesses
and automobiles]{.underline}. [There is a powerful [incentive for
Chinese leaders to take an uncompromising stance on the]{.mark}
Diaoyu/[Senkaku feud, confident that the Chinese people will
back]{.mark} such a stance.]{.underline} All of this suggests that the
United States and its allies need to proceed cautiously about dealing
with China, especially on these three issues. Now is not the time to
press a Chinese leadership that likely feels beleaguered by the
country's economic woes. [The last thing we should do is give those
leaders further temptation to distract the Chinese people with a foreign
policy confrontation. Such a strategy entails the grave risk of
miscalculation and escalation, and that would be a tragedy for all
concerned]{.underline}.

[The most immediate impact of A.I.]{.underline} that [might
reinforce]{.underline} the [feudalistic tendencies]{.underline} of the
digital space is [to create a production system mimicking
corporatism]{.underline} - namely, [the reconfiguration of power
relations through sectoral alliances between coder syndicates and
guilds.]{.underline} This [would entail the control of
algorithm-building and maintaining structures that both state and
private actors rely on]{.underline}, and the foundation of the future
economic system. The corporatization of [[A.I. could reinforce
power-centralization]{.mark} through the combination of corporations
that monopolize modes of code]{.underline} and coder production
[[that]{.mark} will [disproportionately influence politics, military and
science]{.mark} affairs. This will effectively [generate a feudal
network that minimizes political participation]{.mark} and
representation, [leading to the **eradication of
democracy**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Habermasian 'algorithmic
enclosures' that are obscure and inaccessible will establish robust
control mechanisms on the society and in turn, empower coder oligarchies
and corporations in charge of them. The second alarmist trend in the
popular mainstream is the idea that the [**[A.I. will create a 'fascist
system]{.underline}**'28]{.mark} Cyber Governance and Digital Democracy
2018/9 over-centralized [A.I.-based decision-making will [create a
hierarchy of repression in which control-oriented]{.mark}, top-down
[practices will restrict expression]{.mark}, engagement, oversight and
political information-seeking behavior]{.underline}. [**These fears have
been [intensified with the rise of]{.mark} the [far-right groups in the
US]{.mark} and Europe** in the last years, bolstered by Internet trolls,
fake news, and bots]{.underline}. According to the conceptualization of
Foucault29 and Canguilhem30, [the way [technology]{.mark} and science
are [deployed by fascist regimes snowball]{.mark} into a social force,
bursting their initial utilitarian origins [and take on a life of their
own]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Technologism then determines the
bounds of rights and freedoms in a society, becoming the real political
ideology in fascist regimes. In 'techno-fascism,' all aspects of social
life are controlled with the purpose of maximizing scientific progress
and technological advances that are in turn, used to exert newer forms
of sectoral control over social life. [**[Views that don't
conform]{.mark}** or fully converge to the hegemonic ideology **[are
taken out]{.mark}** of the equation **[through imprisonment and
death]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Totalitarianism is different from
authoritarianism in this context since the latter denotes the
centralization of political power without the need to control thoughts
and actions of all citizens through a revolutionary mechanism to change
the human nature or the world at whole. An 'A.I. fascism' or
totalitarianism, therefore, has to entail a bid to change human
relations and social interactions; merely political control and
centralization are not enough on their own

give enormous amounts of money to NSA, this money for defensive use
against the Chinese and so forth. What never comes out is the U.S.
offensive capability against the rest of the world. [The U.S. -- there's
nobody that can even compare to the U.S. We've got an enormous Cyber
Command. They're expanding NSA's secret city by a third to accommodate
14 new buildings, 10 parking garages, a new enormous supercomputer
center -- all this for this new, very secret **Cyber Command. And it's
dedicated largely to offensive, to creating wars**, not preventing
wars.]{.underline} 21 Our leaders tend to paint the United States as
being an innocent victim[. However, more often than not the **United
States is a perpetrator**. As the documents leaked by Ed Snowden
confirmed, the focus of CYBERCOM isn't on deterring attacks**, it's
about launching them**. In many instances these attacks are launched to
**acquire a strategic economic advantage and impose U.S. dominion
abroad**]{.underline}. In the end, it's probably safe to assume that
everyone is spying on everyone else. They always have and probably
always will. Though at the same time, it's also important to recognize
that not all espionage programs are the same, and that scale matters.
Given the amount of tax money our leaders throw at it, [the United
States, with its army of private sector contractors, **steals secrets on
a level both domestically and internationally that is
unsurpassed**]{.underline}. When it comes to breaking into networks and
collecting sensitive information the United States is admittedly in a
class all by itself. Journalist Glenn Greenwald elaborates on the
repercussions of this fact: That the [U.S. government -- in complete
secrecy -- is constructing a **ubiquitous spying apparatus aimed not
only at its own citizens, but all of the world's
citizens**,]{.underline} has profound consequences. It erodes, if not
eliminates, the ability to use the Internet with any remnant of privacy
or personal security. It vests the [U.S. government with boundless power
over those to whom it has no accountability. It permits allies of the
U.S. -- including aggressively oppressive ones -- to **benefit from
indiscriminate spying on their citizens' communications. It radically
alters the balance of power between the U.S. and ordinary citizens of
the world.**]{.underline} And it sends an unmistakable signal to the
world that while the U.S. very minimally values the privacy rights of
Americans, it assigns zero value to the privacy of everyone else on the
planet. 22 [This double standard has serious consequences. It
illustrates that U.S**. leaders are unwilling to adhere to the values**
and principles that they claim to represent.]{.underline} Whistleblowers
have exposed our political elite as untrustworthy. Having lost its moral
authority in this domain, the United States cannot hope to name and
shame cyber offenders. [The ethereal bindings of soft power have
dissolved, leaving only a **dangerous example that other nations can
follow**.]{.underline}

#### American AI is unethical -- they'll establish a terrible global norm 

**Snider '20** (Technology reporer of USA Today, "Clearview AI, which
has facial recognition database of 3 billion images, faces data theft,"
USA Today, 2/26/29)
https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/02/26/clearview-ai-data-theft-stokes-privacy-concerns-facial-recognition/4883352002/

[[Facial recognition software firm **Clearview
AI**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} which has been criticized for scraping
together a database of as many as 3 billion online images, has been hit
with a data breach. The firm, based in New York, apparently saw its list
of customers, which includes numerous law enforcement agencies, stolen,
[according to The Daily
Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-company-that-works-with-law-enforcement-says-entire-client-list-was-stolen),
which first reported the incident. The news site reported that it had
obtained a notice sent to Clearview\'s customers that an intruder had
"gained unauthorized access" to its customer list, the number of
searches customers have conducted and other data. Clearview said in the
notice that the company's servers were not breached and that there was
"no compromise of Clearview's systems or network." However, Clearview\'s
attorney, Tor Ekeland, said in a statement sent to USA TODAY, \"Security
is Clearview\'s top priority. Unfortunately, data breaches are part of
life in the 21st century. Our servers were never accessed. We patched
the flaw, and continue to work to strengthen our security.\" [Facial
recognition [spurs **privacy concerns**]{.mark}:]{.underline} The issue
of facial recognition technology and privacy has been controversial
lately. Student uproar over [the potential implementation of the
face-scanning technology at the University of California Los Angeles led
the school to drop the
plan](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/02/19/ucla-drops-face-recognition-plan/4810648002/).
An editorial in [The Daily Bruin](https://dailybruin.com/) student
newspaper described the plan as \"a major breach of students' privacy\"
that makes \"students feel unsafe on a campus they are supposed to call
home.\" [[Clearview]{.underline}]{.mark} attracted attention after [The
New York Times reported in
January](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html)
that the startup [had [built a database of more than **3 billion
images** gathered from social media sites such as Facebook,
YouTube,]{.mark} as well as payment site [Venmo]{.mark} and other online
destinations.]{.underline} The [[company]{.mark}]{.underline} notes on
[its website](https://clearview.ai/) that [it
[searches]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the open web]{.mark} --]{.underline}
not private social media accounts -- [[and markets its investigative
tool only to law enforcement agencies]{.underline}]{.mark} and \"is NOT
available to the public.\" Federal and state law enforcement officials
told The Times that they had used Clearview\'s app in solving cases from
shoplifting to murder and child sexual exploitation cases. Clearview was
founded by Australian technologist Hoan Ton-That and Richard Schwartz,
an aide to then-New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, the Times reported, and
counts Silicon Valley venture capitalist Peter Thiel among its
investors. [Clearview faces criticism:]{.underline} Since the report\'s
publication, [Google, Facebook, Twitter and Venmo [have sent
cease-and-desist letters to
Clearview](https://apnews.com/4a8ca0d22c503ea241cf5e220384fe37)
demanding the company stop using its platforms for gathering
imagery.]{.underline} "YouTube's Terms of Service explicitly forbid
collecting data that can be used to identify a person," YouTube
spokesman Alex Joseph said in a statement. "Clearview has publicly
admitted to doing exactly that, and in response we sent them a cease and
desist letter." The New Jersey attorney general has banned police from
using Clearview\'s app, [The Times
reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/technology/clearview-ai-new-jersey.html),
and the [[company]{.mark} also [faces **class action**]{.mark}
**[lawsuits]{.mark}** in Illinois and Virginia.]{.underline} And
[Clearview is coming under scrutiny by some in the U.S.
Congress.]{.underline} [Rep. Patrick McHenry]{.underline}, R-N.C., has
[called for House Financial Services Committee]{.underline} chair Maxine
Waters, D-Calif[., to schedule a hearing on the company\'s data
collection practices,]{.underline} [Axios
reported](https://www.axios.com/rep-patrick-mchenry-clearview-data-8fe83d4a-455f-4a97-86cf-da1330ac1d23.html).
[Sen. Edward Markey]{.underline}, D-Mass., who last [month expressed
concerns]{.underline} about Clearview\'s technology, strengthened his
unease after Wednesday\'s report: \"Clearview's statement that security
is its 'top priority' would be laughable if the [[company's failure to
safeguard its information wasn't so **disturbing** **and threatening to
the public's privacy**]{.underline}]{.mark}," he said in a statement.
While the company said it had not been hacked, the incident raises
concerns, he says. "If your password gets breached, you can change your
password. If your credit card number gets breached, you can cancel your
card. But [you can't change biometric information like your facial
characteristics if a company like Clearview fails to keep that data
secure,\" Markey said]{.underline}. \"[This is a **[company whose entire
business model relies on collecting incredibly sensitive and personal
info]{.mark}**rmation]{.underline}, and this breach is yet another sign
that the [potential benefits of Clearview's technology do not outweigh
the grave privacy risks it poses."]{.underline}

#### American tech companies are selling, manipulating, and stealing consumer data

https://www.fastcompany.com/90597583/data-privacy-startpage-founder

There is a curious trend afoot these days. As profits among tech's
biggest players have risen, so too have [the number of breaches and
hacks](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273550/data-breaches-recorded-in-the-united-states-by-number-of-breaches-and-records-exposed/).
Their trajectories nearly mirror each other: up, and to the right. This
is no coincidence, of course. User data, that digital treasure craved by
hackers and businesses alike, is wildly lucrative. [Big tech is using
our data in privacy-invasive ways to source targeted ads, [selling
precise user profiles to advertisers at exorbitant
rates](https://www.fastcompany.com/90310803/here-are-the-data-brokers-quietly-buying-and-selling-your-personal-information)
in a way that allows them [to discriminate against
users](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/us/politics/facebook-housing-discrimination.html)
based on where they live or who they are.]{.underline} In addition,
[companies are using our images to [train biased facial recognition
systems](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/technology/facial-recognition-bias.html#:~:text=Algorithms%20falsely%20identified%20African%2DAmerican,of%20Standards%20and%20Technology%20found.),
which tie into predictive policing and can unjustly put people in
jail.]{.underline} For hackers, data can be held ransom or manipulated
for financial gain. [[For users? These days **most of our online data is
sold, manipulated, stolen**, or in many cases all of the
above]{.mark}.]{.underline} Often we're left with annoying ads that
follow us around or worse, [[our data exposed on the open web]{.mark}
[or used in malicious ways]{.mark} without our approval]{.underline}.
There certainly aren't any profits coming our way. In this all-digital
age, we often forget all that data is actually ours. [This precious
online data---banking information, photos, what we search for, what we
buy---is created by and unique to each of us.]{.underline} Without us
online, this entire ecosystem does not exist. Big Tech's profits would
tumble, as would the number of data breaches. It's concerning then that
we users hold the keys to a door we can't truly access. This is the
terrifying state of online privacy in 2021. We're at a tipping point in
history. Waiting for foolproof legislation or big tech companies to
suddenly have a change of heart will not work. Meanwhile, hacks,
breaches, and rampant misuse of our data are reaching catastrophic
levels. We have a decision to make: We can either take collective action
to regain control of our online privacy, or we can continue down our
current path of least resistance and lose it for good. The cascade of
events that have led to this privacy tipping point stretches back
millennia. Before the development of modern technology, the original
privacy violators were largely governments and politicians. In ancient
Rome, top political players built their own surveillance networks of
cohorts that would alert them to the schemes of their rivals. In the
Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church had its own powerful surveillance
network to track and crack down on hearsay. In the late 18th century,
the French Revolution saw half a million French nobles targeted by the
new government's "committees of surveillance," who arrested those
considered suspicious. And in the 1930s, IBM, perhaps the first "big
tech" company, helped facilitate the Nazis' genocide through the
generation and tabulation of punch cards on national census data. The
dawn of the digital age in the 1990s saw the swift rise of tech
companies whose shiny new offerings came at a hefty price: our data[. In
contrast to the authoritarian surveillance practices employed by
history's governments, [tech companies originally positioned]{.mark}
their [relationship with users as mutually beneficial]{.mark}. Their
products and services were mostly free, which users gobbled up, which
quickly led to the massive growth and user bases tech companies
craved.]{.underline} We didn't think too much about it. But what
appeared to be a genuine and transparent relationship with Big Tech
turned out to be anything but. [A decade or]{.mark} so [later]{.mark}
[we]{.mark} would [learn [that we'd been paying them since day
one]{.underline}]{.mark} [[with]{.mark} our **[behavioral
data]{.mark}**---**[lucrative information]{.mark}** about [how we
move]{.mark} around the internet [and interact]{.mark} with digital
services---and had already lost our privacy.]{.underline} The price we
pay for their wares is not in dollars and cents, but in our data, our
privacy, and our freedom, sold by Big Tech to the highest ad bidder. Big
Tech has thus asked more and more from users over the years, and most of
us have been giving them our most valuable currency (our data) with
little or no thought. We [don't read privacy
policies](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/01/28/not-reading-the-small-print-is-privacy-policy-fail/4565274002/),
we fail to use the [myriad privacy tools](https://www.privacytools.io/)
on the market, and the [most common
password](https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list/) we use to
protect ourselves is most often varying lengths of the numbers 1 through
10. The result: Far too much of our personal data sits outside of our
control and in the hands of those who sell it, manipulate it, or steal
it for profit. Consumers, you must take matters into your own hands.
Legislation and hoping for a change of heart will not tip online privacy
rights back into your favor. Neither will sitting idly by, either
unmotivated or unaware of the assault taking place every second we're
online. We are at a critical tipping point in time. We know what happens
with our data, we know the consequences, and we have the resources and
tools to wrest back control of what is rightfully ours. In this most
critical year, we can take two paths: One is easy and familiar but
devastatingly costly. The other is harder but leads to true freedom and
choice.

**[2nc -- CCP Collapse ! EXT]{.underline}**

**CCP diversionary war goes nuclear**

Polina **Tikhonova 15**, Russia expert at ValueWalk, citing Zhang
Baohui, Prof @ Political Science and Director of the Centre for Asian
Pacific Studies @ Lingnan, "US Faces Nuclear War Threat Over South China
Sea -- Chinese Professor," 11/28,
http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/11/us-nuclear-war-south-china-sea/

[[China]{.mark} is [willing to start a **nuclear war**]{.mark} with the
United States [over the **S**]{.mark}outh **[C]{.mark}**hina
**[S]{.mark}**ea]{.underline}, according to a Chinese professor.¶
[Beijing's rhetoric after an incident with a U.S. warship sailed to the
South China Sea suggests that Chinese decision-makers could [resort
to]{.mark} more "concrete and [forceful]{.mark} [measures]{.mark}" to
counter the U.S. Navy, according to]{.underline} Zhang [Baohui,
Professor of Political Science and Director of the Centre for Asian
Pacific Studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.¶]{.underline} "If
so, [a face-off between the two navies becomes **inevitable**. Even
worse, the [face-off]{.mark} may [trigger]{.mark} an
**[escalation]{.mark} towards military conflicts**]{.underline}," the
professor wrote in a piece for RSIS Commentary.¶ But, according to
Baohui, [the U.S. military is "oblivious" to this scenario, since
Washington decision-makers think America's conventional military
superiority discourages China from responding to such "provocations" in
the South China Sea militarily]{.underline}. [However]{.underline},
[**this** "U.S. expectation **is flawed**, as China is a major nuclear
power," the professor wrote.¶]{.underline} ["[When **cornered**,
nuclear-armed states can threaten **asymmetric escalation**]{.mark} to
deter an adversary from harming its key interests,"]{.underline} he
added.¶ Baohui then refers to the military parade in Beijing that took
place on Sept. 3 and revealed that China's new generation of tactical
missiles -- such as the DF-26 -- are capable of being armed with nuclear
warheads. Moreover, according to the latest reports, China's
air-launched long-range cruise missiles can also carry tactical nuclear
warheads.¶ U.S. could provoke nuclear war with China¶ And while the U.S.
does not have its core interests in the South China Sea, [the disputed
islands present China's **strategic interests**, which is why this kind
of **asymmetry in stakes** would certainly [give Beijing an
**advantage**]{.mark} **in** "the balance of **resolve**" over
Washington]{.underline}, according to the professor. And if the South
China Sea situation escalates and starts spiraling into a nuclear
confrontation between the U.S. and China, Washington will face a choice
of either backing down first or fighting a nuclear-armed power and the
world's largest military force with a strength of approximately 2.285
million personnel.¶ "Neither option is attractive and both exact high
costs, either in reputation or human lives, for the U.S.," Baohui
wrote.¶ So [it would be unwise for the U.S. to **further provoke China**
in the disputed area, since [China's willingness to defend]{.mark} its
[interests, rep]{.mark}utation [and]{.mark} deterrence
[credi]{.mark}bility could **[easily escalate]{.mark}** the conflict
**[into a military confrontation]{.mark}** that would ultimately harm
U.S. interests, according to the professor.¶]{.underline} China will
join Russia in nuclear war with NATO¶ With NATO member state Turkey
downing a Russian jet in its airspace, there is already a high risk of
military confrontation in the world. And with China being so close and
allied with Russia, Beijing decision-makers could see the incident with
the Russian warplane as an opportunity to avenge the West for the South
China Sea provocations.

According to the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS),
[[China will]{.mark} improve efforts to [create **higher yields**
and]{.mark} **higher [quality]{.mark}** production [of]{.mark} major
[food]{.mark} crop varieties, [and **self-sufficiency**]{.mark} in major
livestock and poultry varieties by 2030 [by]{.mark} **[deploying]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nology**]{.underline}. China released an action plan to
promote the national seed industry late last month in Sanya, South
China's Hainan province, where the Nanfan Scientific and Research
Breeding Base is located. [[The plan lays out]{.mark} the necessary
theoretical, scientific and [**technologica**l]{.mark} [developments for
the industry]{.mark} to improve seed varieties and grain
yields]{.underline}, and ensure the protection of national germ plasm
resources. Since the beginning of the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020),
China's ability to innovate in breeding technology has continued to
rise. However, China is still in the process of developing breeding
theories and key technologies. Yields of corn and soybeans have not
reached those of developed countries, while the availability of some
vegetable seeds remains dependent on imports. The need to become
self-reliant in terms of science and innovation-driven technology is
urgent. -- Zhang Hecheng, CAAS official In recent years, [[CAAS has
made]{.mark} **significant [breakthroughs]{.mark}** [in key
tech]{.mark}nologies including genome-wide selection, ploidy
breeding]{.underline} (a process useful in plant breeding[), and
genetically modified organisms, which has laid a solid foundation for
future research. China will introduce 50 major tasks]{.underline}
focused on key crop and livestock varieties, [and three specific actions
involving innovative research, seed enterprises and the creation of a
science and technology platform. [China]{.mark} will [strive to]{.mark}
achieve high-yield, high-quality self-sufficiency in food crop varieties
by 2030, and [ensure]{.mark} the **[absolute security]{.mark}** of the
country's rice and wheat. By 2030, the [self-sufficiency
rate]{.mark}]{.underline} of vegetable varieties, such as broccoli,
carrots and spinach, [will [rise]{.mark} from the current 10%
[to]{.mark} more than **[50%]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Moreover, a
platform will be built to boost seed industry technology, integrating
basic research, technological innovation, variety creation, big data,
and industry incubation. [[China will reinforce]{.mark} the underpinning
role of **[s]{.mark}cience [and]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology** [in
ag]{.mark}ricultural production]{.underline}. In light of the national
conditions and people's needs, science-based and result-oriented efforts
will be made to shore up the areas of weakness. Mechanisms will be
improved to fully mobilise market forces and promote collaboration on
innovation between research institutes and universities, and enterprises
and farmers. A sound commercial breeding system will be established, and
enterprises in the seed industry will be nurtured and expanded. The
research, development and extensive application of practical and
efficient farming machinery and equipment will be supported. [Quality
and efficiency in the agricultural sector will be promoted through
technological innovation.]{.underline} As reported by OpenGov Asia,
digital technology is bound to play a bigger role in the country's steps
toward rural vitalisation and agricultural modernisation. The
digitalisation of rural industries is key to developing the countryside,
and it is a new driver of a sustainable rural economy. [[Integrating
new]{.mark} technology like]{.underline} big data, Artificial
Intelligence [([AI)]{.mark}]{.underline} and the Internet of Things
(IoT) with crop and livestock production [will be [central to
developing]{.mark} **[smart ag]{.mark}riculture**. The involvement of
digital technologies across the supply chain will help increase
efficiency while reducing costs]{.underline}. The push toward digital
agriculture is the result of a plan released in January last year aimed
at improving smart agriculture and providing support for rural
vitalisation in the years leading up to 2025. Jointly released by the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the Cyberspace
Administration of China, the plan proposed building a basic data system
for rural areas to facilitate targeted management and services. The plan
highlighted research into and the use of intelligent agricultural
machinery as well as the development of smart agriculture based on the
internet of things, sensors, location systems, and robots.

NEW DELHI: [[China]{.mark} is believed to be [on the brink of a **major
food shortage**]{.mark}, which might [trigger]{.mark} a strategic
[contest over food]{.mark} [security and push]{.mark} Chinese President
[Xi]{.mark} Jinping already under intense pressure[, toward]{.mark}
drastic measures, potentially [spelling trouble for Taiwan]{.mark} and
other parts of the world. [China]{.mark} has [encountered a **perfect
storm of disasters**]{.mark} this year]{.underline}. On top of
disruption due to the [COVID-19 [pandemic, torrential rains]{.mark} have
caused catastrophic [flooding]{.mark} in the Yangtze River basin,
China's largest agricultural region. Floodwaters are estimated to have
already destroyed the crops on 6 million hectares of
farmland]{.underline}, according to an editorial in The Taipei Times.
[The situation has been further compounded by plagues of
[locusts]{.mark} and fall armyworm infestations in other
regions]{.underline}, where fields have been stripped bare, and three
huge typhoons last month making landfall in northeastern China, the
editorial alleged. [[Food prices increased **13 percent**]{.mark} in
July, with pork prices rising by an eye-watering 85 percent, Chinese
government data showed. There are reports of farmers hoarding crops,
expecting even higher prices.]{.underline} After initially trumpeting
"bumper harvests," Chinese state media have switched from cover-up to
behavior control, touting a national "Clean your plate" campaign on food
wastage, according to the editorial. Last month, Xi called on the
Chinese public to "cultivate thrifty habits, and foster a social
environment where waste is shameful and thriftiness is applaudable."
"The propaganda has shades of Mao Zedong's call for Chinese citizens to
eat only two meals a day at the onset of the Great Famine of 1959 to
1961," the editorial pointed out. ["All the signs point to a
[significant fall in domestic agricultural output]{.mark}, and it is
uncertain whether China will be able to plug the gap with imports, while
also keeping a lid on soaring prices." "[Food shortages]{.mark} look to
be [more than just a]{.mark} short-term [blip]{.mark}.]{.underline} As
China has become more affluent, diets --- and waistlines --- have
expanded, putting a strain on supply and demand. The Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences estimates that [China's domestic supply of rice, wheat
and corn will fall short of demand by 25 million tonnes by the end of
2025]{.underline}. This raises the question, [how can China feed its 1.4
billion people in the long term?,"]{.underline} the editorial quipped.
["[If there is a]{.mark} serious food [shortage]{.mark}]{.underline},
which requires rationing, or even a famine, [[Xi would need the **mother
of all distractions**]{.mark} --- and a small border war with India
probably would not cut it,"]{.underline} The Taipei Times alleged.
["[Chinese]{.mark} military [aircraft]{.mark} are on an almost daily
basis [probing Taiwan]{.mark}'s air defense identification zone.
[Xi]{.mark} might be [trying to goad Taiwan into a **first
strike**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A significant danger point for Taiwan is
the US presidential election in November. Due to the extreme
polarization of US politics, the result is likely to be bitterly
contested." If the US is thrown into chaos with a protracted court
battle to settle the election's outcome, Xi could view this as a
once-in-a-generation opportunity to solve the "Taiwan problem." With
mass protests after the election, the US might in Beijing's eyes appear
historically weak, even on the brink of a civil war, alleged the
editorial. The US has of course been there before during the mid-1960s
and recovered --- but there is a real possibility of a miscalculation on
Xi's part. [To top it off, there is a big date coming up: July 31 next
year marks the [centenary of]{.mark} the founding of the
[C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty. With [Xi]{.mark}
under scrutiny at home for myriad policy failures, he will [need
something to show for it]{.mark} --- and the clock is
ticking]{.underline}, according to Taipei Times.

Why **[the US Will Defend Taiwan]{.underline}**

Some critics claim that the US' messy withdrawal from Afghanistan has
only fueled Beijing's desire to conquer Taiwan because of nagging doubts
about Washington's determination to defend allies. Brussels-based
journalist Stuart Lau, for instance, wrote on Twitter: ​"Imagine Beijing
watching the US military ​'commitment' in Afghanistan while contemplating
its next move on Taiwan." This is a misguided analogy. For one, Beijing
understands that Washington chose to withdraw from Afghanistan to free
up political and military resources to deal with China. Moreover, Taiwan
is strategically much more important to the US than Afghanistan. The
island is a like-minded democracy and an important economic partner
(particularly in semiconductor technology sector, where Taiwan is world
leader). But above all, [Taiwan is crucial as a strategic location for
the US in the region.]{.underline} At a hearing of the US Senate in
December 2021, Ely Ratner -- assistant secretary of defense for the
Indo-Pacific in the Biden administration -- clearly cited Taiwan's
location as a central motivation for his government's commitment to
supporting Taiwan: ​"[Taiwan is located at a critical node within the
first island chain, anchoring a network of US allies and
partners]{.underline} --- stretching from the Japanese archipelago down
to the Philippines and into the South China Sea --- [that is critical to
the region's security and critical to the defense of vital US interests
in the Indo-Pacific. Geographically, Taiwan is also situated alongside
major trade lanes that provide sea lines of communication for much of
the world's commerce and energy shipping]{.underline}." [If Beijing
brings Taiwan under its control, the entire military balance in the
Western Pacific will change]{.underline}. So far, as Bruce Jones very
clearly states in his book To Rule the Waves, China has been severely
restricted by the fact that the first island chain off its coast is
comprised of US allies: Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines. If China
controlled Taiwan, it would break through the first island chain and
gain much freer access to the Western Pacific at large. As Jones writes:
​"China would suddenly gain naval bases beyond the first island chain.
The southern coast of Japan would be much more vulnerable to the Chinese
PLAN and American defenses in the rest of the Western Pacific more
exposed to Chinese power." [It is precisely because the strategic
consequences are so dramatic that we should assume that the US
(alongside allies]{.underline} such as Australia and Japan, which have
both indicated possible military support) [is prepared to defend Taiwan
militarily -- and that **this would lead to a great power
war**]{.underline}. Unless someone who is an advocate of radical
retrenchment assumes the US presidency, [this scenario would likely hold
true in the foreseeable future and under both Republican and Democrat
administrations]{.underline}.

#### China's AI is future of R&D leading the globe, aiding in healthcare, and spurring economic growth

**Shen et al '22** (Responsible for 4x China Analytics practice to \~100
data scientists, developers and business translators in \~2 years, "The
next frontier for AI in China could add \$600 billion to its economy,"
QuantumBlack AI by McKinsey, 6/7/22)
https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/quantumblack/our-insights/the-next-frontier-for-ai-in-china-could-add-600-billion-to-its-economy

Healthcare and life sciences: In recent years, [[China]{.mark} has
[stepped up its **investment in innovation**]{.mark} [in
healthcare]{.mark} [and life sciences]{.mark} [with
AI]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[China's "14th Five-Year Plan"
targets **7 percent annual growth**]{.mark} by 2025 [for R&D
expenditure]{.mark}]{.underline}, of which [at [least 8 percent
is]{.mark} devoted to basic [research]{.mark}]{.underline}. 13 One area
of focus is [accelerating drug discovery and increasing the odds of
success]{.underline}, [which is a significant global issue.]{.underline}
In 2021, global pharma R&D spend reached \$212 billion, compared with
\$137 billion in 2012, with an approximately 5 percent compound annual
growth rate (CAGR). Drug discovery takes 5.5 years on average, which not
only delays patients' access to innovative therapeutics but also
shortens the patent protection period that rewards innovation. Despite
improved success rates for new-drug development, only the top 20 percent
of pharmaceutical companies worldwide realized a breakeven on their R&D
investments after seven years[. Another top priority is improving
patient care, and **[Chinese AI start-ups]{.mark}** today are [working
to build the country's reputation]{.mark} for [providing more accurate
and reliable healthcare]{.mark} in terms of diagnostic outcomes and
clinical decisions.]{.underline} [Our research suggests that [**AI in
R&D** could add **more than \$25 billion** in economic value]{.mark} in
three specific areas: faster drug discovery, clinical-trial
optimization, and clinical-decision support.]{.underline} Rapid drug
discovery. Novel drugs (patented prescription drugs) currently account
for less than 30 percent of the total market size in China (compared
with more than 70 percent globally), indicating a [significant
opportunity from introducing novel drugs empowered by AI in
discovery]{.underline}. We estimate that [[using AI to
accelerate]{.mark} target [identification]{.mark} and novel molecules
design [could contribute up to \$10 billion]{.mark} in
value.]{.underline} 14 Already more than 20 AI start-ups in China funded
by private-equity firms or local hyperscalers are collaborating with
traditional pharmaceutical companies or independently working to develop
novel therapeutics. Insilico Medicine, by using an end-to-end generative
AI engine for target identification, molecule design, and lead
optimization, discovered a preclinical candidate for pulmonary fibrosis
in less than 18 months at a cost of under \$3 million. This represented
a significant reduction from the average timeline of six years and an
average cost of more than \$18 million from target discovery to
preclinical candidate. This antifibrotic drug candidate has now
successfully completed a Phase 0 clinical study and entered a Phase I
clinical trial. Clinical-trial optimization. Our research suggests that
[[another \$10 billion]{.mark} in economic value could [result from
optimizing]{.mark} clinical-study designs (process, protocols, sites),
optimizing trial delivery and execution (hybrid trial-delivery model),
and generating real-world evidence. 15 These [AI use cases]{.mark} can
[reduce the time and cost of clinical-trial development]{.mark},
[provide a better experience for patients and healthcare professionals,
and enable higher quality and compliance]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
For instance, a global top 20 pharmaceutical company leveraged AI in
combination with process improvements to reduce the clinical-trial
enrollment timeline by 13 percent and save 10 to 15 percent in external
costs. The global pharmaceutical company prioritized three areas for its
tech-enabled clinical-trial development. To accelerate trial design and
operational planning, it utilized the power of both internal and
external data for optimizing protocol design and site selection. For
streamlining site and patient engagement, it established an ecosystem
with API standards to leverage internal and external innovations. To
establish a clinical-trial development cockpit, it aggregated and
visualized operational trial data to enable end-to-end clinical-trial
operations with full transparency so it could predict potential risks
and trial delays and proactively take action. [The **[future of AI in
China]{.mark}**:]{.underline} Clinical-decision support. Our findings
indicate that the [use]{.underline} [of machine learning algorithms on
medical images and data]{.underline} (including examination results and
symptom reports) [to predict diagnostic outcomes and support clinical
decisions could generate around \$5 billion in economic
value.]{.underline} 16 A leading AI start-up in medical imaging now
applies computer vision and machine learning algorithms on optical
coherence tomography results from retinal images. It [**automatically**
searches and identifies the signs of dozens of chronic illnesses and
conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, and arteriosclerosis,
expediting the diagnosis process and increasing **early detection of
disease**.]{.underline}

#### Combining with the new 5G, China's AI has the potential to lead in healthcare -- solves disease and aging crisis -- promotes quality of life

**Ye 21** (Sally Ye, health care technology analyst at the Healthcare
Technology division of Omdia, 10-18-2021, \"China\'s medical Artificial
Intelligence market continues to grow,\" Omnia Health Insights,
https://insights.omnia-health.com/artificial-intelligence/chinas-medical-artificial-intelligence-market-continues-grow)

On September 22nd, [Airdoc Technology]{.underline}, [a fast-growing
start-up offering an **AI-driven system** that takes and analyses
photographic images of the retina]{.underline}, passed listing hearing
which means it is going to be the [first public-listed medical AI
company in China. ]{.underline}

[Shukun Tech, another AI-focused start-up focusing on assisting
cardiovascular disease diagnosis]{.underline}, filed for IPO on
September 21st, joining the growing list of Chinese medical AI companies
going public this year.

[China health systems are facing significant challenges to meet
drastically growing medical demand driven by an aging population and
growing patient expectation alongside constrained medical
resources.]{.underline} Lack of high-quality healthcare professionals is
another pain point.[\]{.underline}
\
The [average misdiagnosis rate in China stands at
30%](http://en.people.cn/english/200105/14/eng20010514_69889.html), and
can be as high as 40% for difficult and complicated cases, especially at
more basic medical facilities. The application of AI can alleviate daily
administrative tasks for healthcare professionals and support them in
clinical decisions, improving the patient outcome. All these factors
provide an opportunity for AI application in China healthcare. 

In July 2017, **[The State Council of China released the [New Generation
Artificial Intelligence Development
Plan](http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2017-07/20/content_5211996.htm)]{.underline}**.
This policy [outlines China\'s strategy to build an AI industry worth
more than 62 billion US dollars, driving related industry value worth
more than 774 billion US dollars by 2025.\]{.underline}
\
**[It aims to make China the leading AI power by 2030]{.underline}**.
[Smart healthcare is one of five key AI-based applications]{.underline}
alongside smart manufacturing, smart city, smart agriculture, and smart
national defense. The "Internet + Healthcare" Initiative (launched in
2018) aims to further drive the digital transformation of China's
healthcare systems.

In January 2020, [China FDA granted]{.underline} the first [AI medical
device license which represented a milestone of medical AI
commercialization. Medical AI is applied in a multitude of areas
including imaging, drug development, auxiliary diagnostics, and health
management. \]{.underline}
\
The Omdia Healthcare Equipment Database estimates that China is the
second biggest medical imaging market in the world (5.72 billion US
dollars in 2020). For ultrasound, MRI and CT, it ranks as the top market
globally. Currently, imaging is the most common application of medical
AI in China. [Omdia currently estimates that there are around 150
Chinese medical AI providers]{.underline}, with more than 40% of them
focusing on medical imaging. \
\
At the time of writing, there are more than a dozen AI medical imaging
software companies which have been granted a Class III medical device
license to support clinical decisions.

In September 2021, Tencent obtained a Class III medical device license
for its pneumonia CT imaging software to support triage and assessment,
becoming the first internet company in China to obtain a Class III AI
medical license. (When software is used to support clinical decisions,
it is classified as Class III medical device. For non-clinical decision
support purposes, such as data collection and processing, the software
is classified as Class II medical device.)\
\
[The upgrading of tech]{.underline}nology [infra]{.underline}structure
[in China will also support AI adoption]{.underline}. Of all the 5G base
stations globally, 59% of them are located in China. As per the latest
data released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, 5G
smartphone users in China reached 419 million in August 2021 (30% of
total Chinese population).  

[**5G** increases the speed and responsiveness of the network, enabling
vast data aggregation, remote monitoring and real-time response. The
growing prevalence of 5G shall unleash the **potential of AI
applications in healthcare**.]{.underline}

With the number of Chinese medical facilities expanding and healthcare
expenditure increasing, the Chinese medical device market shall maintain
double digit growth over the next five years.\
\
The government-led "Internet + Healthcare" initiative and state-level AI
strategy shall propel the digital transformation of China's medical
systems. Omdia projects the medical AI market in China will reach 6
billion US dollars in 2025 (a CAGR of more than 20%). \
\
[Startups and hi-tech giants alike are embarking on medical AI solution
development, becoming new stakeholders in the Chinese healthcare device
market. \]{.underline}
\
As equipment and systems become more connected and integrated,
collaboration among healthcare stakeholders will become commonplace.
Traditional healthcare equipment suppliers will need to adapt to the
digital ecosystem of the Chinese market to survive and thrive.\
\
As observed in the Omdia Healthcare IT -- 2021 Topical Report, the
future healthcare system will present a very different landscape: from
in-hospital care to home-based care; from curing to caring and
prevention; from opacity to transparency; and from isolation to
connection and collaboration."

#### R&D key to solve Pandemics

As the world commences the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
[[case for investment]{.mark} [in]{.mark} research and development
([R&D)]{.mark} for medical countermeasures [to prevent and combat
emerging global health threats]{.mark} [is stronger than
ever]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite [tremendous scientific
accomplishments in
2020-21](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html),
systemic gaps in pandemic-related R&D systems, supply chains,
manufacturing, and delivery continue to stymie the roll-out of urgently
needed technologies to all people who need them, everywhere, and are
prolonging the pandemic. COVID-19 and its variants have [exposed
longstanding market and systems failures and
fragilities](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2021/211029-PandemicVaccineDevelopmentReport.pdf)
that pose barriers to timely and effective pandemic R&D. Not only do
these persistent gaps threaten to undo progress achieved through the
scientific breakthroughs, but they also [exacerbate entrenched
inequalities](https://dashboard.pandemicactionnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Addressing-Market-Failures-The-Role-of-CEPI-in-Bridging-the-Innovation-Gap-to-Prevent-the-Next-Pandemic.pdf)
that leave the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people around the globe
without access to lifesaving medical countermeasures and essential
health services, and perpetuate gross power imbalances between high- and
low-income nations. [[COVID-19]{.underline}]{.mark} has also
[[unleashed]{.mark}]{.underline} a multitude of actors in
pandemic-related R&D across the innovation spectrum and across the
globe, underscoring the [growing [need for]{.mark} more purposeful
[alignment, coordination, information-sharing, and transparency]{.mark}.
The world urgently needs a fit-for-purpose, proactive, and resilient
pandemic R&D ecosystem]{.underline}. [There is [broad consensus]{.mark}
that [R&D]{.mark} is a [vital component of building a world better
equipped to prevent, prepare for, and respond to pandemic
threat]{.mark}s.]{.underline} [[Yet new investments]{.mark} in
innovation [will fail]{.mark} to meet their promise to save lives,
prevent future global health emergencies, and build a healthier, safer
world for all unless governments, international institutions, and
industry are willing to heed the hard lessons of this pandemic and work
together to fix these systemic failures and challenges.]{.underline}
Produced by Global Health Technologies Coalition and Pandemic Action
Network with contributions by members of the Pandemic Action Network's
Pandemic Preparedness Working Group, this policy brief calls on world
leaders to prioritize action in four key areas to close the critical
R&D, manufacturing, and delivery gaps necessary to end the acute
COVID-19 crisis and build a more resilient, equitable pandemic R&D
ecosystem for the future

#### Future pandemics cause extinction

Eleftherios P. **Diamandis 21** (works for the Department of Pathology

[The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which is causing [COVID 19]{.mark}
disease[, has taught]{.mark} us unexpected [lessons about the dangers of
human extinction through]{.mark} highly contagious and lethal
[disease]{.mark}s. As the COVID 19 pandemic is now being controlled by
various isolation measures, therapeutics and vaccines, it became clear
that [our]{.mark} [current lifestyle]{.mark} and societal functions may
[not]{.mark} be [sustainable in the long term]{.mark}]{.underline}. We
[now [have to start]{.mark} thinking and [planning]{.mark} on how [to
face the next]{.mark} dangerous [pandemic, not just overcoming the one
that is upon us]{.mark} now. [Is there]{.mark} any [ev]{.mark}idence
[that]{.mark} even [worse pandemics could strike]{.mark} us in the near
future [and threaten the existence of the human race?]{.mark} The answer
is unequivocally [yes]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is not necessary to get
infected by viruses of bats, pangolins and other exotic animals that
live in remote forests in order to be in danger. Creditable scientific
evidence indicates that the human gut microbiota harbor billions of
viruses which are capable of affecting the function of vital human
organs such as the immune system, lung, brain, liver, kidney, heart etc.
It is possible that the development of pathogenic variants in the gut
can lead to contagious viruses which can cause pandemics, leading to
destruction of vital organs, causing death or various debilitating
diseases such as blindness, respiratory, liver, heart and kidney
failures. [These [diseases could result n]{.mark} the [complete shutdown
of]{.mark} our [civilization and]{.mark} probably [the extinction of
human race]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this essay, I will first provide a
few independent pieces of scientific facts and then combine this
information to come up with some (but certainly not all) hypothetical
scenarios that could cause human race misery, even extinction. I hope
that these scary scenarios will trigger preventative measures that could
reverse or delay the projected adverse outcomes.

**[2nc -- China AI better]{.underline}**

**China should lead the world with it's advance AI**

Graham **Allison,** 10-31-20**18**, \"Is China Beating the U.S. to AI
Supremacy?,\" Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs,
https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy

Though still in their infancy, [AI]{.smallcaps} technologies will be
drivers of future economic growth and national security. From facial
recognition and fintech to drones and 5g, [China is not just catching
up. In many cases, it has already overtaken the United States to become
the world's undisputed No. 1. In some arenas, because of constitutional
constraints and different values, the United States willfully forfeits
the race. In others, China is simply more determined to
win.]{.underline}

China's [AI]{.smallcaps} surge is so recent that anyone not watching
closely has likely missed it. As late as 2015, when assessing its
international competition, American industry leaders---Google,
Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon---saw Chinese companies in their rearview
mirrors alongside German or French firms in the third tier. But this
changed four years ago---in 2016---when
leading [AI]{.smallcaps} application company DeepMind fielded a machine
that defeated world champion Lee Sedol in the world's most complex board
game,
Go.[^[9]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-049) Even
after several American companies' machines had bested the chess masters
of the
universe[^[10]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-048),
most Chinese remained confident that machines could never beat Go
champions, since Go is ten thousand times more complex than chess. Thus,
DeepMind's decisive victory became for China a "Sputnik
moment"[^[11]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-047)---a
jolt as dramatic as the Soviet Union's launch of the first satellite
into space that sparked America's whole-of nation surge in math and
science, nasa's creation and the original "moon shot."

Kai-Fu Lee's book *AI Superpowers* offers an insightful summary of
China's engagement in the field. It began with President Xi Jinping's
personal reaction to the defeat of the world's Go champion. [Declaring
that this was a technology in which China had to lead, he set specific
targets for 2020 and 2025 that put China on a path to dominance
over [AI]{.smallcaps} technology and related applications by
2030.[^12^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-046)]{.underline} Recognizing
that this would have to be led by entrepreneurial companies rather than
agencies of government, he designated five companies to become China's
national champions: Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, iFlytek and
SenseTime.[^[13]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-045) Twelve
months after Xi's directive, investments in
Chinese [AI]{.smallcaps} startups had topped investments in
American [AI]{.smallcaps} startups.[^[14]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-044) [By
2018, China filed 2.5 times more patents in AI technologies than the
United
States.[^15^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-043) And
this year China is graduating three times as many computer scientists as
the United States.]{.underline}

In contrast to nuclear weapons---where governments led in discovery,
development and deployment---[AI]{.smallcaps} and related technologies
have been created and are being advanced by private firms and university
researchers. The military establishments in Washington and Beijing are
essentially playing catch-up, adopting and adapting private-sector
products.

Where do these two competitors stand in the [AI]{.smallcaps} race today?
Consider leading indicators under six key headings: product market
tests, financial market tests, research publications and patents,
results in international competitions, talent and national operating
environments.

Consumers' choices of products in markets speak for themselves. In
fintech, C[hina stands alone. Tencent's WeChat Pay has nine hundred
million Chinese
users,[^16^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-042) while
Apple Pay only has 22 million in the United
States.[^17^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-041) And
when it comes to capability, WeChat Pay can do much more than Apple
Pay.]{.underline} Chinese consumers use their app to buy coffee at
Starbucks and new products from Alibaba, pay bills, transfer money, take
out loans, make investments, donate to charity and manage their bank
accounts. In doing so, [they generate a treasure trove of granular data
about individual consumer behavior that [AI]{.smallcaps} systems use to
make better assessments of individuals' credit-worthiness, interest in
products, capacity to pay for them and other behavior.]{.underline} In
mobile payments, Chinese spend \$50 for every dollar Americans spend, in
total, \$19 trillion in
2018.[^[18]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-040) U.S.
mobile payments have yet to reach \$1 trillion. Credit cards are as
old-fashioned to Chinese millennials as handwritten checks are to their
American counterparts. Mark Zuckerberg has noticed: Facebook's major
moves last year into digital
payments,[^[19]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-039) including
the recent introduction of Facebook Pay, are copying Tencent, rather
than the other way around.

In facial recognition, the world's most
valuable [AI]{.smallcaps} startup is Chinese company
SenseTime[^[20]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-038)---a
company whose headquarters Graham visited in October. (While there,
Graham also took a tour of Zhongguancun---China's version of Silicon
Valley---guided by Kai-Fu Lee whose hedge fund is one of the leading VC
investors in Chinese AI startups.) [In 2018's international competition
for facial recognition, Chinese teams claimed the top five
places.[^21^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-037)]{.underline} Chinese
firms---such as Hikvision and Dahua Technology, which control a third of
the world's security camera
market[^[22]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-036);
Tiandy, whose cameras need light from only a single star at night to
capture high-definition color
images[^[23]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-035);
and Wuhan Guide Infared, which specializes in infrared and thermal
imaging---are working hand in glove with their government to perfect
facial recognition for profit and control. In this domain, there is no
U.S.-China contest; [the United States has essentially conceded the race
because of concerns over the average individual's privacy, and deep
reservations about how this technology could be deployed.]{.underline}
Westerners were alarmed in 2017 when researchers at Stanford created
an [AI]{.smallcaps} algorithm that could detect with shocking accuracy
individuals' sexual orientation simply by scanning a single
photo[^[24]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-034).
It does not take much imagination to consider how less socially liberal
governments would apply this technology. [So while San Francisco
recently banned facial recognition technologies, the Party has given
China's top four facial recognition firms access to its database of over
1.4 billion citizen photos. One well-informed venture capitalist in this
arena estimates that Chinese facial recognition firms have 1 million
times more images than their U.S. counterparts.]{.underline}

[In speech tech, Chinese are beating American firms in all
languages---including English.]{.underline} The world's top voice
recognition startup is China's iFlytek. Its user base is seven hundred
million, almost twice the 375 million people who speak to Apple's
Siri.[^[25]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-033) In
system performance competitions, iFlytek regularly beats teams from
Google, Microsoft, Facebook, ibm and mit, all in its second
language.[[^26^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-032) At
Stanford's international challenge for machine reading comprehension,
Chinese teams won three of the top five spots, including first place.
Baidu developed a human-level speech recognition system a year before
Microsoft did.]{.underline}

Who was the U.S. Army's major supplier of commercial drones until
2017---when the United States prohibited purchases for foreign
suppliers?[^[27]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-031) Shenzhen
drone maker DJI, which controls 70 percent of the global
market[^[28]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-030).
Drones would be just miniature hobby helicopters without
elementary [AI]{.smallcaps}, which gives them computer vision for
targeting weeds or weapons, and enables them to operate in swarms. As
the recent attack on Saudi Arabia's principal oil facilities
demonstrated, the world has just begun to discover the security
consequences of [AI]{.smallcaps}-enhanced drones operating literally
below the radar. Of the world's top five commercial drones brands, 3 are
Chinese; 1
American.[^[29]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-029)

[5g infrastructure will be the backbone that enables [AI]{.smallcaps} to
reach further into everyday life, from automated cars to smart glasses.
China's Huawei is the world's leading supplier of this telecom
equipment. Not only does it own the Chinese market, which will be the
world's largest, but its 28 percent global market share nearly equals
the combined shares of its two top
competitors.]{.underline}[^30^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-028) Of
the top four brands that will build 5g infrastructure, two are Chinese
and zero are American. Chinese firms own twice as many 5g -essential
patents as American firms. While the outcome of the current U.S.
government campaign against Huawei remains uncertain, the company is
currently delivering 5g systems well ahead of all competitors and is
bringing a 5g phone to market a year ahead of Apple, the company that
invented the iPhone.

Financial markets reflect these realities. Five years ago, two of the
world's twenty most valuable internet companies were Chinese; today,
nine are. The "Seven Giants of the [AI]{.smallcaps} age"---Google,
Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent---are split on
either side of the Pacific. Of every ten venture capital dollars
invested in [AI]{.smallcaps} in 2018, five went to Chinese startups;
four to American
firms.[^[31]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-027) Of
the world's top ten [AI]{.smallcaps} startups, half are American and
half are Chinese.

[Chinese investments in [AI]{.smallcaps} research and development have
surged to American levels, and the results are beginning to show
it.]{.underline} The blunt truth is that China is laying the
intellectual groundwork for a generational advantage
in [AI]{.smallcaps}. According to the Allen Institute for Artificial
Intelligence's authoritative assessment, [China would overtake the
United States in 2019 in the most-cited 50 percent
of [AI]{.smallcaps} papers.]{.underline} It will take the lead in the

**China's Artificial Intelligence Strategy Poses a Credible Threat to
U.S. Tech Leadership**

a Credible Threat to U.S. Tech Leadership,\" Council on Foreign

Last month, Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Google's parent company
Alphabet, [delivered](https://www.cnas.org/publications/transcript/eric-schmidt-keynote-address-at-the-center-for-a-new-american-security-artificial-intelligence-and-global-security-summit) a
wake-up call: the unchallenged technological supremacy that the United
States has enjoyed since the fall of the Soviet Union is over. [The
future will belong to countries that can surf the technological tidal
wave of [artificial
intelligence](https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/files/publication/AI%20NatSec%20-%20final.pdf),
and while China's efforts appear up to the challenge, the United States
is swimming in the wrong direction.]{.underline}

[When China released its national [AI strategic
plan](https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/blog/chinas-plan-lead-ai-purpose-prospects-and-problems/) this
summer announcing it would lead the world in AI technology by 2025, some
in the military and Silicon Valley scoffed. They repeated the same tired
cliché that China's tech industry and scientific researchers [can't
innovate](https://hbr.org/2014/03/why-china-cant-innovate), only copy.
Schmidt, by contrast, sees China's AI ambitions as completely
believable]{.underline} "You're crazy to treat them as somehow second
class citizens" he said, addressing
an [audience](https://www.cnas.org/events/artificial-intelligence-and-global-security-summit) full
of American national security officials and AI researchers.

Rather than being significantly behind, [Chinese programmers
now [routinely
win](https://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2017/07/31/china-ai-imagenet/#234be6f7170a) international
machine learning competitions]{.underline}. China's [tech giant
Baidu](https://www.wired.com/story/how-baidu-will-win-chinas-ai-raceand-maybe-the-worlds/) is
unambiguously one of the global leaders in AI research, having developed
an AI system with better-than-human speech recognition performance a
year before any Western firm. [China is not yet the overall leader in AI
technology, but they are not far behind and catching up
quickly. ]{.underline}

The United States national security and tech communities urgently need
to adjust to this new reality. [China's [military and
commercial](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/09/08/china-is-using-americas-own-plan-to-dominate-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence/) AI
ambitions pose the first credible threat to United States technological
supremacy since the Soviet Union. China's advantage is its strategic
focus and funding to match AI's extraordinary opportunity. Beijing has
not yet announced the funding total for their AI strategy, but it is
already clear that the figure is in the billions.]{.underline} Top
Chinese leaders, including Xi Jinping, have loudly trumpeted the
strategy at nearly every opportunity. The AI strategy rollout resembles
that of China's 2014 national semiconductor plan, which was ultimately
allocated [\$150
billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-25/china-has-big-plans-for-homegrown-chips) over
ten years.

[Moreover, China's strategy recognizes the essential dual-use nature of
artificial intelligence. The same core technological capabilities that
enable commercial innovation are equally useful for warfare and
espionag]{.underline}e. Snapchat uses AI-enabled facial recognition
technology to allow teenagers to send each other [funny
pictures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc2aJxnmzh0). China uses the
same technology in support of [domestic
surveillance](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-all-seeing-surveillance-state-feared-in-the-west-is-a-reality-in-china-1498493020).
[Jaywalk across a street in Shenzhen, and you're liable to have your
face and name displayed onscreen nearby, along with a police reminder
that "jaywalkers will be captured using facial-recognition
technology.]{.underline}In pursuit of China's AI policy of
"military-civil fusion," the government has already established joint
military-commercial research laboratories and testing facilities in
areas like deep learning and autonomous vehicle development. [The same
facility](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Kania_Testimony.pdf) might
support testing of a luxury self-driving car one week, and a
self-driving tank the next.

[China's dominance of artificial intelligence technology and its
military applications is not only credible but likely in the absence of
a massive shift in U.S. policy]{.underline}. The United States needs a
surge of focus and funding comparable to the "Sputnik moment" that
launched the space race. Unfortunately, it is actually the Chinese who
have accurately come to understand the Sputnik-like significance of
recent progress in artificial intelligence. After all, Sputnik scared
the United States into action because it simultaneously revealed that it
was behind in rocketry and that rocketry was a critical technology.
Despite China's astonishing AI progress, it overall remains behind the
United States and its allies. For China, the [2016
match](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/two-moves-alphago-lee-sedol-redefined-future/) between
the AlphaGo AI system (developed by Google subsidiary DeepMind) and Go
world champion Lee Sedoul was a Sputnik moment.

Go, which has been played in China for thousands of years, is a [major
fixture](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304259304576374013537436924) of
Chinese culture and strategic thinking. Unsurprisingly, AlphaGo's
victory received greater attention in China than the United States. Many
of China's leading computer scientists attended the matches in person.
Like Sputnik, AlphaGo taught China both that AI was going to be the
critical technology for the future of economic and military superiority
and that they were behind the West. Only a year later, [China released
its national strategy for AI, which made funding AI research and
utilizing AI technology throughout government a national
priority.]{.underline}Unfortunately, the Trump administration's latest
budget slashes funding for basic research, including a [10 percent
cut](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/27/technology/china-us-ai-artificial-intelligence.html?_r=0) to
the National Science Foundation's already meagre AI budget. U.S.
policymakers must realize just how wrong their current approach to the
AI revolution is. Doing so will require convincing the military and tech
industry that their decades-long dominance is truly at risk. Perhaps
such a wake-up call would require a Sputnik moment, but if the United
States waits for one it will likely be too late.

### 2nc -- Central Investment Key

**China's emphasis on government collaboration is key**

There is a widespread belief that China is establishing itself as a new
superpower, displacing the United States from the **global power
structure**[. [China has]{.mark} undeniably [become a worldwide
**economic powerhouse**]{.mark}, and it is anticipated to overtake the
U.S. as the world\'s largest economy by 2028. With increased spending on
weapons research and the development of multiple covert weapons, China
is on the verge of [surpassing the U.S. in **military
capability**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Significantly, [countries that lead
in the research and application of]{.underline} artificial intelligence
[**(AI)** will determine the future of the technology and increase their
**economic competitiveness** greatly, while those that fall behind risk
losing competitiveness in **critical industries**. AI is set to
**revolutionize** the world, empowering those countries that fully
realize its promise. It will be a key driver of future **economic
growth** and **national security**.]{.underline} Moreover, AI is
sometimes referred to as a general-purpose technology because of its
wide range of applications in practically every industry -- the GUID
Partition Table (GPT). A GPT is a technology with widespread economic
implications. Only a few examples exist such as steam engines,
electricity and computers. These technologies have had a profound impact
on our civilizations by modifying preexisting economic and social
systems. AI is the newest brilliant, dazzling object on the
technological horizon. It has grown very popular in today\'s globe.
It\'s the simulation of human intellect in computers that have been
programmed to learn and mimic human behavior. [AI will have a
significant impact on our **quality of life** as it develops. It has the
potential to significantly boost the economy of a developed
country.]{.underline} For its technological advancements, [[China has
won the AI battle with the U.S.]{.mark} and is on its way to world
supremacy. According to Western intelligence assessments,
[China,]{.mark} the **world\'s second-largest economy**, is [expected to
**dominate**]{.mark} many major **[emerging tech]{.mark}nologies**,
including **AI,** **synthetic biology** and **genetics**, [within a
decade]{.mark} or two.]{.underline} Pentagon official's words [The
**[Pentagon]{.mark}**\'s first chief software officer,]{.underline}
Nicolas Chaillan [[stressed that "]{.mark}in 15 to 20 years[, we have
no]{.mark} competing fighting [chance against China.]{.mark}" **[It\'s
already decided]{.mark}**; "Whether it requires a war or not is kind of
anecdotal right now." He also claimed that [several]{.mark} governmen[t
departments in the U.S. had \"**kindergarten-level**\" **cyber
defenses.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Moreover, [Chaillan also criticized
[the **reluctance** of U.S. firms]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as Google,
[[to]{.mark} [**collaborate** with the government on AI]{.mark}, and
extensive ethical disputes over technology for the U.S.'
[delay]{.mark}ed [innovation]{.mark}. While China was destined to rule
the world\'s future, everything from **media narratives** to
**geopolitics** is under their control. One of the reasons
[China]{.mark} has been able to move more rapidly than the U.S. is that
it [is not mired in enormous arguments about **AI**]{.mark}
**ethics**]{.underline}**.** But partly because [Chinese [businesses are
compelled to]{.mark} [collaborate with the government]{.mark}, whereas
many American businesses are wary of working with the
Pentagon.]{.underline} Google, for instance, halted working with the
Pentagon on AI in 2018 after a dozen employees departed after the
business assisted the Department of Defense in developing software that
could boost drone attack accuracy. Chaillan, on the other hand, stated
that [[Chinese corporations]{.mark} were obligated to comply with the
Chinese government and were [making \"**huge expenditures**\" in
AI]{.mark}]{.underline} without concern for ethical considerations.
Notably, [the U.S. has attempted to curb China\'s emergence as a digital
power by prohibiting Huawei\'s 5G network from operating in the U.S. and
establishing a virtual embargo on U.S. companies supplying software and
components to Chinese tech firms]{.underline}. Whereas China's President
[[Xi]{.mark} Jinping [is pushing]{.mark} China [to establish
**technological self-sufficiency**]{.mark} in fields such as microchip
manufacturing to wean the country off its reliance on the
U.S.]{.underline} Significantly, there will always be economic ups and
downs, but [[the **underlying dr**]{.mark}**ive** that\'s occurring in
Chinese culture right now [will continue to create]{.mark} **new
prospects** and **[growth]{.mark}**. China has announced a five-year
plan worth \$1.8 trillion to dominate **AI,** **robotics, 6G** and **all
other technologies** by 2035, releasing a five-year plan worth \$1.8
trillion.]{.underline} In comparison to the European Union and the U.S.,
China\'s AI capabilities have advanced in several areas. [[China has
surpassed the bloc as the world\'s **largest AI
publisher**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, [[the quality of its **AI
research** has consistently improved over time]{.mark}. Its software and
computer services companies have increased their **R&D expenditures**.
China\'s determination to master AI goes far beyond the recognition that
this group of technologies will be the most crucial driver of **economic
advancement** over the next quarter-century. China\'s data collection
and national determination have helped it to close the gap with American
leaders in this area over the last decade.]{.underline} China now has
nearly twice as many supercomputers ranked in the top 500 for
performance as the U.S., even though the U.S. was once the leader in
this category. Furthermore, [[China is likely to]{.mark} [maintain its
advantage]{.mark} in terms of **data generation**]{.underline}. Overall,
though, China has not dramatically narrowed the AI gap with the U.S.,
but its steady growth could eventually erode U.S. dominance over the
technology. Consequently, countries that lead in the research and
application use of AI will determine the future of the technology and
increase their economic competitiveness greatly, while those that fall
behind risk losing competitiveness in critical industries. As a result,
China has taken the lead. The Chinese government, rules and regulations,
public attitudes toward privacy and strong collaboration between
corporations and the government are all contributing to the country\'s
AI progress. At the same time, [American AI confronts significant
challenges, including a culture that prioritizes **privacy over
security**, distrusts authority and the government; as such, firms are
wary of collaborating with the U.S.]{.underline}

**China has advantages in [speed]{.underline}, [execution]{.underline},
[product quality]{.underline}, [data]{.underline}, and [government
support]{.underline}.**

WHEN ENRICO FERMI decided to leave Benito Mussolini's Italy and emigrate
to the United States, he changed the global balance of power. After
arriving in the US, Fermi led the world's first self-sustaining nuclear
reaction at the University of Chicago and played an indispensable role
in the Manhattan Project, which led to the end of World War II in the
Pacific and laid the groundwork for a new world order and America's
prominent role. So it is not surprising that some Americans think the
same should be true with AI. Emigrant AI researchers like Geoff Hinton,
Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, Andrew Ng, and Fei-Fei Li are the Enrico
Fermis of AI and should secure an American (and Canadian) hegemony in
AI. Indeed, the US and Canada have 100 percent of the top 10 AI
researchers, and 68 percent of the world's best 1,000 or so researchers.
But [**[tech]{.mark}nological [revolutions]{.mark}** [are not]{.mark}
only [driven by **big discoveries**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Often, [[once
a]{.mark} **fundamental [breakthrough]{.mark}** [has been
published]{.mark}, the center of [gravity]{.mark} quickly
[shifts]{.mark} from a handful of **elite researchers** [to]{.mark} an
**army of [tinkerers]{.mark}**---engineers with enough expertise [to
apply]{.mark} the [tech]{.mark}nology [to]{.mark} different
**[real-world problems]{.mark}**]{.underline} and customer needs. This
is particularly true when the payoff of a breakthrough is diffused
throughout society rather than just concentrated in a few labs. Mass
electrification exemplified this process. [Following Thomas Edison's
harnessing of electricity, the field rapidly shifted from **invention to
implementation**.]{.underline} [Thousands of engineers everywhere began
tinkering with electricity,]{.underline} using it to power new devices
and reorganize industrial processes. [Those tinkerers didn't have to
break fundamentally new ground like Edison]{.underline}. They just had
to know enough about how electricity worked to turn its power into
useful and profitable machines. [Our present-day phase of **AI
implementation** fits this latter model]{.underline}. But you might say:
A constant stream of headlines about AI breakthroughs (AlphaGo, Stanford
beating doctors in cancer diagnosis, Microsoft beating human in speech
recognition, etc.) shows that we are still in an age of discovery. [In
reality, we are witnessing the application of the same **fundamental
breakthrough**---**deep learning** and related techniques---to many
different problems. That's a process that requires well-trained **AI
engineers**, the tinkerers of this age, to apply and tweak deep learning
for each domain. Today, those tinkerers are applying AI's superhuman
powers of pattern recognition to making loans, driving cars, translating
text, and powering our Amazon Go and Amazon Alexa.]{.underline}
[Deep-learning pioneers]{.underline} like Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun,
and Yoshua Bengio---the Enrico Fermis of AI---[continue to push the
boundaries of **artificial intelligence**]{.underline}. [And they may
yet produce another game-changing breakthrough, one that scrambles the
global technological pecking order. But in the meantime, the real action
today is with the tinkerers, those who implement AI and make it solve
real-world problems. And [this is where **China** comes
in]{.mark}---while the US is the world's leader in AI discoveries,
[China is]{.mark} actually [the leader in AI implementation]{.mark}.
[What matters]{.mark} in AI implementation [is]{.mark} **[speed,
execution, product quality, data, and government support]{.mark}**.
[**Chinese companies** are]{.mark}]{.underline} equal to or [[ahead
of]{.mark} their **[America]{.mark}n counterparts** [in each of
these]{.mark} areas.]{.underline} First, let's look at speed. [[The
Chinese environment is a combination of a **huge market, ample capital,
and daring entrepreneurs**]{.mark} who are the embodiment of "lean
startup": fail fast, fail early, and fail often. Chinese entrepreneurs
are fast to find market opportunities, build products, and pivot when
needed.]{.underline} For example, after companies like Uber and Didi
proved the viability of ride-sharing, China's startup world caught
sharing fever, trying out every possible iteration of it: shared
bicycles, shared mopeds, shared concrete mixers, and shared mobile phone
chargers. The vast majority of these died off quickly (known as fail
fast), but a few rose to become unicorns, such as Mobike, which reached
20 million rides per day and was sold for \$2.7 billion three years from
founding. This rapid prototyping and tweaking approach have also enabled
Chinese AI companies to find winners. For example, Megvii (Face++) is a
computer vision company that originally tried face morphing games and
face unlock of phones before striking gold on finance fraud avoidance as
the killer app (think of credit card companies using face scan instead
of customer service "quizzes" on suspicious credit card usage). As
mobile payments ballooned to \$18.8 trillion in China, this turned out
to be the winner. In another example, AInnovation started on AI sales
forecast but added hardware products like computer-vision driven vending
machines and whole-basket check-out kiosks, all within six months. There
are many other examples like this in my book, AI Superpowers. In
execution, [[Chinese entrepreneurs]{.mark} are [unafraid]{.mark} of the
tedious, messy, and risky tasks]{.underline}, if they help achieve the
ultimate result. [Chinese [CEOs]{.mark} usually [have **absolute
power**]{.mark} within the company, which [makes]{.mark}
[execution]{.mark} much more [effective.]{.mark}]{.underline} As an
example, the "Chinese Groupon" Meituan was tenacious in focusing on
users' needs and found a way to nail that problem. They found that
people wanted to eat take-out food, but it had to be delivered with 30
minutes (including cooking time), and the cost must be brought down to
about 70 cents per delivery in order to profitably offer "free
delivery." Meituan then maniacally worked on this problem for years,
eventually hiring 600,000 people on mopeds, adopting an Uber model,
finding riders willing to work during meal hours, tweaking the
lowest-cost delivery vehicle (battery-operated mopeds), solving the
battery life problem for mopeds, inventing AI matching and routing
algorithms. After billions of dollars of losses and many years of
iterations, Meituan managed deliver food to any destination within 30
minutes and under 70 cents. That totally changed the way Chinese people
eat. And that differentiated it from the US Groupon, Yelp, and
OpenTable, which collectively are worth less than one-tenth of the \$60
billion valuation. Meituan chose this approach rather than resting on
its laurels like Groupon and Yelp, because Chinese entrepreneurs are
tenacious and if you have a profitable "light-weight" business, you will
find yourself surrounded by entrepreneurs who want a share of your
profits. Fierce competition pushes entrepreneurs to improve the product
at lightning speed, with incredible work ethic, always pressured to
develop impregnable business models. As a result, Chinese products often
evolved into better products than their American counterparts (e.g.,
Wechat vs. Whatsapp, Weibo vs. Twitter, Taobao vs. eBay). The Chinese
market rapidly embraces new products and new paradigms. Just within the
last 3 years, mobile payments have emerged as the dominant transaction
tool, replacing cash and credit cards. Total transaction in 2017 was
\$18.8 trillion, even larger than China's GDP. China's mobile payments
are built on the world's best infrastructure: nearly
zero-transaction-fee, micropayment-capable, and peer-to-peer. Over 700
million Chinese users can pay each other, whether for online, offline,
loan, or gift, whether to your child, a farmer in a village, or even a
beggar. [All of this is amplified by [China's]{.mark} enormous
[market]{.mark} size, which [generates the **treasure trove**]{.mark}
[of data that fuels AI]{.mark}]{.underline} (AI is usually more improved
by more data than better AI engineers). [China's data edge is three
times the US based on mobile user ratio, 10 times the US in food
delivery, 50 times in mobile payment, and 300 times in shared bicycle
rides. All this rich [data]{.mark} is [used to make Chinese]{.mark}
companies' [AI work better]{.mark}. Finally, the [Chinese **government's
support** of AI]{.mark} development will prove [important]{.mark} in the
age of AI, though not in the way most Western analysts
believe]{.underline}. Western narratives trivialize the government's
role as subsidizing winners and protecting them from foreign
competition. But actually, [sophisticated government [support comes in
three forms]{.mark}]{.underline}, which are neither blind nor
anti-competitive: (1) [**[Central government]{.mark}** [sets the
tone]{.mark}, which can legitimize a burgeoning industry like AI and
influence companies and consumers to adopt AI]{.underline} (and smart
young people to go into AI); (2[) **[techno-utilitarian
policy]{.mark}**, which allows unproven technology to be launched early
and quickly and adds regulation only if necessary later]{.underline}
(enabling a nation-wide displacement of cash and credit cards with
mobile payment); (3) [**[infrastructure-building]{.mark}**, such as
rebuilding cities and highways with special roads with sensors and
special lanes or "levels" for autonomous vehicles]{.underline}
([contrasted with the US decision to slow down autonomous truck
testing]{.underline} due to job displacement concerns). [As a
result]{.underline} of all of the above, [[China has the world's most
valuable companies]{.mark} in computer vision, drones, speech
recognition, speech synthesis, and machine translati]{.underline}on.
Sinovation Ventures, my VC company, now has five AI unicorns, with a
combined valued of \$23B. These companies were founded only two to four
years ago. [[The speed, execution, product focus, access to data, and
government support are significantly higher than]{.mark} their
[America]{.mark}n counterparts]{.underline}. So can we conclude that
China is the de facto winner of the AI race? No, because researchers
worldwide are still plunging ahead. Not long ago, Geoff Hinton made a
call for top researchers to abandon deep learning and develop brand-new
machine learning algorithms that can come closer to human intelligence.
So what can this balance of strengths and weaknesses tell us about
international leadership in AI? Here, it helps to zoom in on perhaps the
most coveted of all AI-powered products: fully autonomous vehicles.
Companies in both countries are feverishly chasing the dream of mass
deployment of cars that drive themselves. They've made great strides
toward this goal, but it still remains an open question which company or
country will get there first. That question gets right to the crux of
the US-China dichotomy between visionary research and practical
implementation. Waymo (an Alphabet company) jumped out to a major lead
in autonomous vehicles because it was willing to think big and take
risks. Once Waymo demonstrated that this was possible (in large part due
to breakthroughs like deep learning), companies in both the United
States and China started playing catch-up. At the same time, local
Chinese officials began competing with each other to attract
autonomous-vehicle startups, pledging to build entirely new public
infrastructure projects to facilitate deployment: highways lined with
sensors that communicate with vehicles and elevated roads reserved for
training autonomous vehicles. The winner in this race will likely depend
on whether the final bottleneck is about core technology or
implementation details. If the bottleneck is technical---major
improvements for core algorithms---then advantage US. If the bottleneck
is about implementation---smart infrastructure or policy
adaptation---then advantage China. What should the US do in light of the
rising Chinese AI capabilities? I have three suggestions. First, move
away from trivializing the Chinese approach (e.g., copycat, government
protectionism), recognize that the Chinese approach has merit, and be
open to learning from it. Second, double down on fundamental research,
where the US has a huge lead over the rest of the world. American
universities attract top students around the world, who learn AI in the
US, and many will choose to stay. Third and most important, recognize
that AI development is not the new cold war. AI is more like electricity
than nuclear weapons. US and China have much to learn from each other.
And the opportunities and challenges from AI are much larger than any
threat or competition from any one country to another.

Nick Chaillan, [the **U.S. Department of State'**s]{.underline}
first-ever [software chief]{.underline}, resigned in September 2021. He
[claimed that the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates had "[no]{.mark}
competing **[fighting chance]{.mark}** [against China]{.mark} in the
next 15 to 20 years." [China is]{.mark} currently [winning the race
toward **global dominance** in **a**]{.mark}**rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence**]{.underline}. But how did China get so far
ahead? [AI technology will play a major role in driving **economic
growth** and **national security**]{.underline} in the foreseeable
future. [China's AI investment is a new development that only started to
gain traction in the past several years]{.underline}. In 2015, China was
still behind the United States, along with French and German AI firms as
well. However, one event in 2016 pushed China on its upward slope toward
AI supremacy. DeepMind, a leading AI application company, created a
machine that beat the world champion in Go, the world's most complex
board game. By this time, many American companies had already
constructed machines capable of beating chess world champions. However,
Go is thousands of times more complex than chess, so many were confident
that it would be impossible to create such a machine. Yet, China did it.
Skepticism about the potential of China's AI technology triggered a
reaction from President [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping; contrary to
what was being said, he [[declared]{.mark} that [China would
be]{.mark}come a [leader]{.mark} in AI. In the years that followed,
[Beijing prioritized **a**]{.mark}**rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence**
and **cyber capabilities** over traditional **military spending**,
[leading to an **aggressive approach**]{.mark} in dominating the AI
industry with a specific focus on **surveillance** and **data
collection**. Xi wanted **major tech companies**, instead of government
agencies, to lead this innovation.]{.underline} He appointed five
national champions --- Alibaba for smart cities; Baidu for autonomous
driving; iFlytek for voice recognition; SenseTime for facial
recognition; and Tencent for computer vision for medical imaging. [Xi
also set targets that would ensure China's dominance in AI technology
and other related sectors by **2030**. And just one year after Xi set
his targets and appointed AI leaders, [China saw **major**]{.mark}
**[advancements]{.mark}** in its race against the United States.
Investments in [Chinese]{.mark} AI [startups]{.mark} [overtook]{.mark}
investments in [American]{.mark} **AI [startups]{.mark}**]{.underline};

for AI technologies]{.underline} by 2018. And [in 2020 [China had
**three times**]{.mark} the number of [college graduates in the
**computer sciences**]{.mark} than the United States did.]{.underline}
[WeChat]{.underline}, which was developed by Tencent, [became the
world's **largest mobile app** in 2018]{.underline} with over 1 billion
monthly users. The app can collect major quantities of data thanks to
government support and Newark privacy policies. Today, [China dominates
the various sectors of AI technology]{.underline}. In financial
technology, Apple Pay in the United States has 22 million users. On the
other hand, Tencent's WeChat Pay has 900 million users in China and
greater technological capabilities than Apple Pay, which allows the app
to generate vast amounts of data about consumer behaviors that Chinese
systems can then use to develop more advanced technology. Moreover, in
2018 Chinese consumers spent \$19 trillion through mobile payments,
while the United States is still struggling to hit \$1 trillion. [[In
**facial recognition**]{.mark}, [Washington essentially dropped
out]{.mark} of the race due to privacy concerns and the ethics of how
this technology could be deployed.
[Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} however, [[claimed the top 5
spots]{.underline}]{.mark} in the 2018 international competition for
facial recognition. [[Chinese firms]{.underline}]{.mark} individually
[[control a **third**]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the world's [security
cameras]{.mark}]{.underline}, can capture high-definition color images
with minimal light, and specialize in thermal imaging. Together, they
work with Beijing to perfect this technology for both profit and
security purposes. [[China is also beating]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[States in **speech technology**]{.mark}. iFlytek, the world's top voice
recognition company, has a user base of almost double the number of Siri
users,]{.underline} with 700 million people using iFlytek. And once
again, [[Chinese teams claimed three of the top five]{.mark}
[spots,]{.mark} including first place]{.underline}, at Stanford
University's international competition for machine reading
comprehension. [Of the world's top five commercial **drone** brands,
three of them are Chinese brands, while just one is
American]{.underline}, with Shenzhen drone company DJI controlling 70%
of the global market of drone technology. [Additionally[, **5G
infrastructure** is essential]{.mark} for a future that runs on AI
technology. [China has two firms within the top four global
leaders]{.mark} for providing this technology, while the United States.
has none.]{.underline} Huawei, a Chinese firm, is the world's leading
supplier of 5G infrastructure and technology, occupying 28% of the
global market share --- equalling the combined shares of its two biggest
competitors. However, many consider China far behind the United States
when it comes to AI ethics and governance. American social culture and
political culture values privacy over security and fosters distrust in
authority and the government. [[American values have]{.mark} led to
early [debates]{.mark} and conversations [on how to regulate AI]{.mark}
and its algorithms. [These discussions have made it]{.mark}
[difficult]{.mark} for the United States [to]{.mark} significantly
[advance]{.mark} its AI technology]{.underline}. [On the other hand, [AI
ethics have not been]{.mark} as large of [an issue in China]{.mark}.
Public opinions in China about privacy have allowed AI to quickly
develop. In fact, [it wasn't until October]{.mark} 2021 [that China
issued its first guidelines]{.mark} on **AI ethics**, prioritizing user
rights and data control. [China is not just trying to gain **global
dominance** in AI]{.mark} technology [but is]{.mark} currently
**[succeeding]{.mark}** and dominating all aspects of the
field]{.underline}. AI will have the potential to greatly affect
commerce, national security and general society in the next couple of
decades. If it wants to keep up, the United States needs to make a
decision about whether it will invest in AI technology and begin to
seriously compete with China, or continue to waiver on AI and prove Nick
Chaillan right.

China on Artificial Intelligence,\" National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/techland-when-great-power-competition-meets-digital-world/united-states-has-fallen-behind-china

The [[recent Beijing Olympics showcased]{.underline}]{.mark} one
particular [threat]{.underline}, [as China trotted out new]{.underline}
artificial intelligence ([[AI]{.underline}) [and robotics
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}[nologie[s]{.mark} with vital relevance to
Washington's current geopolitical tensions with Beijing]{.underline}.
From [driverless buses]{.underline} to [high-speed rail powered by
5G]{.underline}, advanced Chinese technology was featured front and
center. Indeed, the digital currency-only games, focused around the
e-CNY currency which has already been[ picked
up](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-digital-yuan-wallets-swell-usage-lags-2022-01-17/#:~:text=During%20July%2DOctober%20last%20year,billion%20yuan%20(%249.77%20billion).) by
some 140 million people, were a little peek into a reality that China
has embraced while the West has dithered.

As the recent Olympics emphasized, AI is a driving obsession for China.
The [robot chefs making burgers at Olympic facilities]{.underline} and
the [smart beds measuring athletes' vital statistics]{.underline}
weren't just gimmicks for the cameras: they['re a symbol of how [China
has quickly eclipsed the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[when it comes to the deployment and use
of AI]{.underline}]{.mark} technologies.

[[China is doubling down on next-generation]{.mark} tech in general and
[AI]{.mark} in particular, [while]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is falling
behind]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[an extent
that the Pentagon's first chief software officer]{.mark} Nicolas
[Chaillan]{.mark}[[ resigned]{.mark} last
fall](https://www.ft.com/content/f939db9a-40af-4bd1-b67d-10492535f8e0?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Recode%2010.13.2021&utm_term=Recode)[ in
protest over the slow pace of tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nological
[transformation in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
[[saying that "**we have no competing fighting chance against China in
15 to**]{.mark} **[20 years]{.mark}.**"]{.underline}

[According to Chaillan, [there's no way Washington is going to catch
up]{.mark} to [Beijing's cyber and AI]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline}.
Many [experts concur]{.underline}---Graham Allison, of the Belfer
Center,
recently[[ noted](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy) that
many American officials are far too complacent about Western supremacy
in tech]{.underline}nology, while Pakistani researcher Ruqayya
Anwer[ wrote](https://www.dailysabah.com/opinion/op-ed/china-is-winning-the-power-battle-in-ai-race-with-us) in
an op-ed earlier this year that "**[[China has won]{.mark} the
[AI]{.mark} battle with the U.S. [and]{.mark} [is on its way to world
supremacy]{.mark}]{.underline}**." In particular, Anwer concluded that
[China will]{.underline} vastly [dominate]{.underline} any number of
strategic technologies, including [AI]{.underline}, within a decade or
two.

The West has offered plenty of excuses for lagging behind on AI, not
least arguments about how Communist China doesn't have the same ethical
standards and privacy concerns as Europe and North America. The truth,
however, is that AI will be increasingly key to the future of national
power and cohesion. In stark terms---[if]{.underline} the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [wants to preserve its values
and keep pace with China, it needs to get very serious about AI, very
fast.]{.underline}

[Up until now, that has simply not been the case.]{.underline}
[[Successive American administrations have let AI
**languish**]{.underline}]{.mark}---and, as a result, [even
[American-based AI firms]{.mark} are looking abroad for
business.]{.underline} Take [NASDAQ-listed Remark Holdings]{.underline},
for example. Remark is doing[ crucial
work](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/brightline-collaborates-with-remark-ai-to-build-on-its-smart-safety-solutions-301424116.html) by
developing AI-based solutions such as its platform which uses computer
vision to monitor transport corridors like[ Florida's Brightline
Rail](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/29/799962246/brightline-nations-deadliest-railroad-after-high-number-of-track-deaths)---the
United States' deadliest railway per mile---and make them safer.
Nevertheless, Remark Holdings
[currently[[ generates]{.mark}](http://ir.remarkholdings.com/static-files/fe507f94-511e-4bae-a5aa-da520f4cdba5) the
[majority]{.mark} [of its revenue in
China]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[for]{.mark} [one]{.mark}]{.underline}
simple [[reason]{.underline}]{.mark}, the fact [that
[China]{.mark}]{.underline} has a history of valuing and
[[prioritizing]{.mark} [AI]{.mark}, while the United States
doesn']{.underline}t.

As for the military side of things, the United States is far behind.
Only now is the American military properly stepping away from its
longtime use of[ Chinese-manufactured DJI
drones](https://www.voanews.com/a/usa_us-military-still-buying-chinese-made-drones-despite-spying-concerns/6175967.html) and[ using](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/44230/army-buys-artificial-intelligence-infused-folding-quadcopters-for-battlefield-use) American-made
AI drones, from U.S. manufacturer Skydio, instead. That's a bit late to
the party, to say the least, given the fact that security concerns have
persisted for years over using Chinese technology in sensitive sectors. 

While the U.S. Department of Defense has
increasingly[ committed](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/39559/national-security-commission-warns-u-s-is-not-prepared-to-defend-or-compete-with-china-on-ai) to
developing American-made AI tools, leading figures like former Deputy
Secretary of Defense Robert Work are clear about the challenges ahead,
noting that "**[[America is not prepared to defend or compete]{.mark} in
the AI era]{.underline}**."

Economically, letting AI fall to the wayside is also incredibly
shortsighted and negligent. From farming to manufacturing, artificial
intelligence could give humans an assist, helping them do their jobs
faster and more efficiently---yet while China leaps ahead in this
regard, the United States keeps on taking half measures.

It's time to take real steps to turn that around. The [[House and
Senate]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[seem **confused** and
**unsure**]{.mark} [about]{.mark} [how]{.mark} [to]{.mark} truly [meet
China's rising AI prowess]{.mark}]{.underline}, but there should be a
bipartisan drive to take a quantum leap forward in funding and promotion
of AI if the United States wants to maintain its leading position in the
twenty-first century.

More specifically, [putting AI at the forefront while]{.underline} also
successfully [addressing ethical concerns requires leaning on America's
strength in tech]{.underline}nology [infra]{.underline}structure and
focusing on getting people familiar and enthusiastic about AI, including
by funding more departments at universities and other institutions.

There is also significant potential for the United States to team up
with partner nations in NATO for co-funding research and investment
opportunities on AI. The United States doesn't really have an adequate
intellectual supply of professionals in the machine learning and AI
field, which is why NATO partnerships as well as teaming up with
nationals from places like India is a potentially promising proposal.

[Educating the]{.underline} American [public on the importance of
keeping up in the AI race will be critical]{.underline}. As Gregory
Dawson and Kevin DeSouza from Brookings
recently[ observed](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2022/02/03/how-the-u-s-can-dominate-in-the-race-to-national-ai-supremacy/),
the American [population seems to]{.underline} either [view AI "as a
futuristic utopia or an impending disaster]{.underline}"---with little
nuance in the middle. 

"Without a realistic view of the world of AI," they argued, "the
populace is unlikely to understand the need for engagement, and the
prospects that the industry sector offers".

What's clear is that the United States can no longer afford to fall
behind in the AI race, which is shaping up to be the
twenty-first-century equivalent of the space race. American officials
can't talk seriously about national security and securing the future if
they're going to continue treating civilian and military applications of
AI as an afterthought.

**China is ahead in AI development** -- they've overtaken the US in
[patents filled]{.underline}, [Compsci graduates]{.underline},
[5G]{.underline}, and [research papers]{.underline}

Graham **Allison 18** (\"Is China Beating the U.S. to AI Supremacy?,\"
Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, 10-31-2018,
https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy)

Though still in their infancy, [AI]{.smallcaps} technologies will be
drivers of future economic growth and national security. From facial
recognition and fintech to drones and 5g, [China is not just catching
up. In many cases, it has already overtaken the United States to become
the world's undisputed No. 1. In some arenas, because of constitutional
constraints and different values, the United States willfully forfeits
the race. In others, China is simply more determined to
win.]{.underline}

China's [AI]{.smallcaps} surge is so recent that anyone not watching
closely has likely missed it. As late as 2015, when assessing its
international competition, American industry leaders---Google,
Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon---saw Chinese companies in their rearview
mirrors alongside German or French firms in the third tier. But this
changed four years ago---in 2016---when
leading [AI]{.smallcaps} application company DeepMind fielded a machine
that defeated world champion Lee Sedol in the world's most complex board
game,
Go.[^[9]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-049) Even
after several American companies' machines had bested the chess masters
of the
universe[^[10]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-048),
most Chinese remained confident that machines could never beat Go
champions, since Go is ten thousand times more complex than chess. Thus,
DeepMind's decisive victory became for China a "Sputnik
moment"[^[11]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-047)---a
jolt as dramatic as the Soviet Union's launch of the first satellite
into space that sparked America's whole-of nation surge in math and
science, nasa's creation and the original "moon shot."

Kai-Fu Lee's book *AI Superpowers* offers an insightful summary of
China's engagement in the field. It began with President Xi Jinping's
personal reaction to the defeat of the world's Go champion. [Declaring
that this was a technology in which China had to lead, he set specific
targets for 2020 and 2025 that put China on a path to dominance
over [AI]{.smallcaps} technology and related applications by
2030.[^12^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-046)]{.underline} Recognizing
that this would have to be led by entrepreneurial companies rather than
agencies of government, he designated five companies to become China's
national champions: Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, iFlytek and
SenseTime.[^[13]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-045) Twelve
months after Xi's directive, investments in
Chinese [AI]{.smallcaps} startups had topped investments in
American [AI]{.smallcaps} startups.[^[14]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-044) [By
2018, China filed 2.5 times more patents in AI technologies than the
United
States.[^15^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-043) And
this year China is graduating three times as many computer scientists as
the United States.]{.underline}

In contrast to nuclear weapons---where governments led in discovery,
development and deployment---[AI]{.smallcaps} and related technologies
have been created and are being advanced by private firms and university
researchers. The military establishments in Washington and Beijing are
essentially playing catch-up, adopting and adapting private-sector
products.

Where do these two competitors stand in the [AI]{.smallcaps} race today?
Consider leading indicators under six key headings: product market
tests, financial market tests, research publications and patents,
results in international competitions, talent and national operating
environments.

Consumers' choices of products in markets speak for themselves. In
fintech, C[hina stands alone. Tencent's WeChat Pay has nine hundred
million Chinese
users,[^16^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-042) while
Apple Pay only has 22 million in the United
States.[^17^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-041) And
when it comes to capability, WeChat Pay can do much more than Apple
Pay.]{.underline} Chinese consumers use their app to buy coffee at
Starbucks and new products from Alibaba, pay bills, transfer money, take
out loans, make investments, donate to charity and manage their bank
accounts. In doing so, [they generate a treasure trove of granular data
about individual consumer behavior that [AI]{.smallcaps} systems use to
make better assessments of individuals' credit-worthiness, interest in
products, capacity to pay for them and other behavior.]{.underline} In
mobile payments, Chinese spend \$50 for every dollar Americans spend, in
total, \$19 trillion in
2018.[^[18]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-040) U.S.
mobile payments have yet to reach \$1 trillion. Credit cards are as
old-fashioned to Chinese millennials as handwritten checks are to their
American counterparts. Mark Zuckerberg has noticed: Facebook's major
moves last year into digital
payments,[^[19]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-039) including
the recent introduction of Facebook Pay, are copying Tencent, rather
than the other way around.

In facial recognition, the world's most
valuable [AI]{.smallcaps} startup is Chinese company
SenseTime[^[20]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-038)---a
company whose headquarters Graham visited in October. (While there,
Graham also took a tour of Zhongguancun---China's version of Silicon
Valley---guided by Kai-Fu Lee whose hedge fund is one of the leading VC
investors in Chinese AI startups.) [In 2018's international competition
for facial recognition, Chinese teams claimed the top five
places.[^21^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-037)]{.underline} Chinese
firms---such as Hikvision and Dahua Technology, which control a third of
the world's security camera
market[^[22]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-036);
Tiandy, whose cameras need light from only a single star at night to
capture high-definition color
images[^[23]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-035);
and Wuhan Guide Infared, which specializes in infrared and thermal
imaging---are working hand in glove with their government to perfect
facial recognition for profit and control. In this domain, there is no
U.S.-China contest; [the United States has essentially conceded the race
because of concerns over the average individual's privacy, and deep
reservations about how this technology could be deployed.]{.underline}
Westerners were alarmed in 2017 when researchers at Stanford created
an [AI]{.smallcaps} algorithm that could detect with shocking accuracy
individuals' sexual orientation simply by scanning a single
photo[^[24]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-034).
It does not take much imagination to consider how less socially liberal
governments would apply this technology. [So while San Francisco
recently banned facial recognition technologies, the Party has given
China's top four facial recognition firms access to its database of over
1.4 billion citizen photos. One well-informed venture capitalist in this
arena estimates that Chinese facial recognition firms have 1 million
times more images than their U.S. counterparts.]{.underline}

[In speech tech, Chinese are beating American firms in all
languages---including English.]{.underline} The world's top voice
recognition startup is China's iFlytek. Its user base is seven hundred
million, almost twice the 375 million people who speak to Apple's
Siri.[^[25]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-033) In
system performance competitions, iFlytek regularly beats teams from
Google, Microsoft, Facebook, ibm and mit, all in its second
language.[[^26^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-032) At
Stanford's international challenge for machine reading comprehension,
Chinese teams won three of the top five spots, including first place.
Baidu developed a human-level speech recognition system a year before
Microsoft did.]{.underline}

Who was the U.S. Army's major supplier of commercial drones until
2017---when the United States prohibited purchases for foreign
suppliers?[^[27]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-031) Shenzhen
drone maker DJI, which controls 70 percent of the global
market[^[28]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-030).
Drones would be just miniature hobby helicopters without
elementary [AI]{.smallcaps}, which gives them computer vision for
targeting weeds or weapons, and enables them to operate in swarms. As
the recent attack on Saudi Arabia's principal oil facilities
demonstrated, the world has just begun to discover the security
consequences of [AI]{.smallcaps}-enhanced drones operating literally
below the radar. Of the world's top five commercial drones brands, 3 are
Chinese; 1
American.[^[29]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-029)

[5g infrastructure will be the backbone that enables [AI]{.smallcaps} to
reach further into everyday life, from automated cars to smart glasses.
China's Huawei is the world's leading supplier of this telecom
equipment. Not only does it own the Chinese market, which will be the
world's largest, but its 28 percent global market share nearly equals
the combined shares of its two top
competitors.]{.underline}[^30^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-028) Of
the top four brands that will build 5g infrastructure, two are Chinese
and zero are American. Chinese firms own twice as many 5g -essential
patents as American firms. While the outcome of the current U.S.
government campaign against Huawei remains uncertain, the company is
currently delivering 5g systems well ahead of all competitors and is
bringing a 5g phone to market a year ahead of Apple, the company that
invented the iPhone.

Financial markets reflect these realities. Five years ago, two of the
world's twenty most valuable internet companies were Chinese; today,
nine are. The "Seven Giants of the [AI]{.smallcaps} age"---Google,
Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent---are split on
either side of the Pacific. Of every ten venture capital dollars
invested in [AI]{.smallcaps} in 2018, five went to Chinese startups;
four to American
firms.[^[31]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-027) Of
the world's top ten [AI]{.smallcaps} startups, half are American and
half are Chinese.

[Chinese investments in [AI]{.smallcaps} research and development have
surged to American levels, and the results are beginning to show
it.]{.underline} The blunt truth is that China is laying the
intellectual groundwork for a generational advantage
in [AI]{.smallcaps}. According to the Allen Institute for Artificial
Intelligence's authoritative assessment, [China would overtake the
United States in 2019 in the most-cited 50 percent
of [AI]{.smallcaps} papers.]{.underline} It will take the lead in the
most-cited 10 percent this year. And by 2025, the United States will
fall to second in the top 1 percent of
papers.[^[32]{.underline}^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-026) (Fortunately,
in breakthrough papers, China remains behind.) [In public patents
for [AI]{.smallcaps} technologies, China passed the United States in
2015, and in 2018 filed 2.5 times more than
America.[^33^](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy#footnote-025)]{.underline} In
machine learning's hottest subfield---deep learning---China has six
times more patent publications than the United States. (Raw numbers,
however, must be taken with a grain of salt, since not all patents are
equal.)

President Biden often speaks about challenges to democracy from
autocracies such as China and Russia, but there are ways that the U.S.
form of democracy, capitalism and strategic investment could be improved
without calling out other countries for violating humanitarian
principles.

One way is for U.S. policymakers, CEOs and research institutions to get
better organized and coordinated, especially to compete with China on
the technology front. Recent Senate passage of the \$250 billion U.S.
Innovation and Competition Act USICA to help the supply chain and build
more chip fabs is a good start.

Make no mistake, the [[Chinese are ahead
technologically]{.underline}]{.mark}---and **[[way ahead in some
quarters]{.underline}]{.mark}**.  A space race seems to be underway. 
Recently, the country landed a rover on Mars without the need for
decades of advance flights. Last week, [China sent three astronauts into
orbit to build a space station after being locked out of the
International Space Station a decade ago over security concerns lodged

anemic in cybersecurity wars in coming years. The EV and autonomous
vehicle progress in China exceeds most nations.

Some senators who voted in favor of USICA brought up all the reasons to
worry about China, including the proclivity of Chinese companies to
steal intellectual property of U.S. firms. Their argument basically goes
that the U.S. has the smart engineers and isn't it a shame that the
thieving Chinese are able to benefit from it. But that reasoning begs
the question: Why was the coveted IP not commercialized in the U.S. as
well, or ahead of the Chinese in the first place?

The richest companies in the U.S. are starting to increase investment in
R&D, but there is also apparently a need to take new ideas and apply
venture capital to bring products to the fore. The U.S. may have more
padded investors than any other country and some of the greatest minds
and inventions, but all that has not given the U.S. the edge, yet, in
vital products that will fight the next pandemic or vastly improve clean
energy production or face off threats from China, real or imaginary.

Publicly traded companies in the U.S.  focus heavily on quarterly
earnings, but relatively few have produced long-term plans for growth
beyond five or 10 years with a few offering glib projections of zero
carbon emissions by 2050. The federal government of the last 40 years
has dropped the ball, frankly, on paying attention to vital supplies,
allowing chip companies to find the lowest-cost supplier in countries
where wages are lower and materials are closer at hand. It's the
American Way, of course, to keep costs down, but at what long-term
expense?

Competition in the U.S. seems to make every technology company in
Silicon Valley the opponent of its neighbor just across the highway,
while the attitude in China seems to be one of cooperation by all with a
set long-term agenda. Having such centralized coordination makes the
entire U.S. enterprise---from Congress to the smallest chip
designer---look in terrible disarray or at least unable to look beyond
the bounds of a single company's balance sheet.

Human rights

Of course, it is easy to cite human rights abuses in China with [reports
of abuses ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-22278037%C2%A0)of
Hong Kong protesters or millions of Uighurs in Xinjiang. (China's
apparent interest in controlling the South China Sea makes the
technology race more imperative.)

Our hearts go out to all the victims of humanitarian abuse. However,
China's humanitarian practices cannot offer an excuse for a seemingly
brain-dead or half-awake institutional and governance approach in the
U.S. to applying a strong focus on R&D and efforts to improve the
efficiency of processes to bring ideas to full fruition. Years ago, it
would have helped if there were more government coordination and private
cooperation in fostering a strong RAN (Radio Access Network) technology
provider based in the U.S. Meanwhile, Huawei in China became strong in
that technology and others, and it is evident how much concern that has
caused with U.S. companies losing out on sales to Huawei due to U.S.
government prohibitions.

President Biden, thankfully, seems to understand how trade, tech
innovation, China and foreign policy are all interwoven, but [[it is
going to take years to meet the Chinese tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology
[[challenge at the present pace]{.underline}]{.mark}. Let's face it:
[[China will]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed [[become the largest
econ]{.mark}omy [in 2027]{.mark}]{.underline} and it's about time for
top investors and CEOs to grapple with that reality. It may mean looking
inside the U.S. and stretching to create new partnerships for better
cooperation and financing.

[[The Biden administration pushed last week for the Group of Seven
nations to adopt]{.mark} a Build Back Better World ([B3W]{.mark})
initiative [as an apparent challenge to]{.mark} the ambitious Beijing
Belt and Road Initiative ([BRI]{.mark}).]{.underline} But the B3W so far
only sounds like a nice name.[ It is intended to
prod](https://www.reuters.com/world/g7-counter-chinas-belt-road-with-infrastructure-project-senior-us-official-2021-06-12/%C2%A0) the
G7 and its allies to mobilize private sector capital in areas such as
climate, health and health security, digital technology and gender
equity and equality. [While [that plan is still in its
infancy]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[China with its BRI has signed agreements
with more than 100 countries to cooperate in 2,600 BRI projects]{.mark}
worth \$3.7 trillion]{.underline}, according to a Refinitiv database. 

There are some concrete steps that can be taken, going beyond what USICA
does, to enhance coordination for greater technology efficiency and
production domestically. One might be the creation of a new federal
agency (yes, more government!) to develop and implement advanced
industry and technology strategy, as the Information Technology and
Innovation Foundation recently proposed.  It would be "explicitly
focused on the commercial competitiveness of select sectors that are
most critical to the economy,"[ ITIF said in a
report.](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/4ex7CgJNyPCv5rRSE3vsW?domain=u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net)

Another reality must also be addressed, at least regarding chip
production. With the overwhelming majority of advanced chips made in
Taiwan, there needs to be a reality check that U.S. manufacturers can't
provide future chip production alone even with a big fab buildup
contemplated in USICA's \$39 billion in grants. "No one should adopt the
goal of decoupling from the global supply or reshoring or onshoring,"
said Semiconductor Industry Association President John Neuffer in
a [recent
forum.](https://www.fierceelectronics.com/electronics/government-chip-aid-not-a-handout-commerce-official-says)

The creation of a new system of chip production more centered in the
U.S. is going to take years, requiring a degree of humility on the part
of super-competitive companies and some keen organizational skills by
federal bureaucrats. Hopefully, this massive amount of work happens
before China sets up a human settlement on the Moon or Mars and all that
implies.

### 2nc -- China is transparent

#### Chinese approach to AI is good\-- they're paving the way for transparency

**Holland 22** - Makenzie Holland is a news writer covering big tech and
federal regulation. Prior to joining TechTarget, she was a general
reporter for the Wilmington StarNews and a crime and education reporter
at the Wabash Plain Dealer. (Holland, Makenzie. "Experts See Positives
to China\'s New AI Regulations." SearchEnterpriseAI, TechTarget, 14 Mar.
2022,
https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/news/252514586/Experts-see-positives-to-Chinas-new-AI-regulations.
)

China\'s new AI regulations tackle some of the most controversial
elements of the technology, including algorithmic explainability and
transparency \-- something businesses will need to pay attention to,
analysts said.

The AI regulations took effect March 1.
They [require](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/navigate-chinas-new-data-and-ai-regulations/) AI
algorithms that make recommendations to users to be moral, accountable
and transparent, according to Guannan Lu, analyst at Forrester Research.

[[China\'s AI regulations prohibit algorithms from using personal
data]{.underline}]{.mark} to change a product\'s price from one person
to the next. [[Businesses]{.mark} will also be [required to be
transparent]{.mark} about the purpose of the algorithm]{.underline}
they\'re using, such as for making product recommendations, according to
a [translation](https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-internet-information-service-algorithmic-recommendation-management-provisions-effective-march-1-2022/) of
China\'s AI regulations published by Stanford University.

[[China\'s]{.mark} new AI [regulations are some of the
most ]{.mark}[[ambitious]{.mark} AI regulations
to](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/news/252465706/Gauging-the-right-amount-of-government-regulation-of-AI) date]{.underline},
said Alan Pelz-Sharpe, founder of research firm Deep Analysis.

\"[There are [elements]{.mark}]{.underline} in here that [[other nations
could learn from]{.underline}]{.mark},\" Pelz-Sharpe said.

Though it may be \"counterintuitive\" to give China credit regarding its
AI regulations given the political climate, Pelz-Sharpe said [[its rules
\"set a new benchmark]{.mark} that may drive improved regulations
elsewhere]{.underline}.\"

The AI regulations outlaw algorithmic price gouging and require an
explainable algorithmic decision-making process. [The [algorithms have
to be \"trustworthy]{.mark} AI]{.underline},\" meaning built and [tested
to be as [fair, explainable and bias-free]{.mark} as
possible]{.underline}, Pelz-Sharpe said.

While there are discussions about [[trustworthy
[AI]{.mark}](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/feature/Building-trustworthy-AI-is-key-for-enterprises)[ in]{.mark}
areas such as Europe and [the U.S]{.mark}]{.underline}., Pelz-Sharpe
said [there\'s [little from a regulatory standpoint]{.mark} when it
comes to defining the phrase. China]{.underline}, he said, [is \"making
this concrete]{.underline}.\"

\"Beyond blatant and deliberate misuse of AI, two of the biggest factors
of concern for its use are bias and explainability,\" he said. \"These
regulations at least attempt to address some of these concerns.\"

Pelz-Sharpe said time will tell how well the AI regulations work and how
enforceable they will be. But for now, there are good portions of the AI
regulations for other countries drafting their own AI regulations to
consider. Though the European Union has proposed draft AI regulations,
the U.S. has not.

[[China]{.mark}\'s regulations [provide a
\"blueprint]{.mark}]{.underline} for AI regulations elsewhere,\"
Pelz-Sharpe said. Forrester\'s Lu  said China provides one example of
the kinds of regulations that might be needed around the technology.

#### China Building ethical AI standards

**Sheehan '22** (Matt Sheehan\--fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, research focuses on global technology issues, with
specialization in China's artificial intelligence ecosystem, "China's
New AI Governance Initiatives Shouldn't Be Ignored", Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, 1/4/22)
https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/01/04/china-s-new-ai-governance-initiatives-shouldn-t-be-ignored-pub-86127

Over the past six months, the [[Chinese gov]{.mark}ernment]{.underline}
has [[rolled out a series of policy documents]{.mark} and public
pronouncements]{.underline} that are finally [putting meat on the bone
of the country's governance regime for]{.underline} artificial
intelligence ([AI]{.underline}). [Given China's track record of
leveraging AI for mass surveillance, it's tempting to view these
initiatives as little more than a fig leaf to cover widespread abuses of
human rights.]{.underline} But that response risks ignoring regulatory
changes with major implications for global AI development and national
security[. Anyone who wants to compete against, cooperate with, or
simply understand China's AI ecosystem must examine these moves
closely.]{.underline} These [[recent initiatives show the emergence of
three different]{.mark} [approaches]{.mark} to AI governance, each
championed by a different branch of the Chinese bureaucracy, and each at
a different level of maturity.]{.underline} Their backers also pack very
different bureaucratic punches. It's worth examining the three
approaches and their backers, along with how they will both complement
and compete with each other, to better understand where China's AI
governance is heading[. The [strongest and most immediately influential
moves in AI]{.mark} governance have been [made by]{.mark} the Cyberspace
Administration of China ([CAC),]{.mark} a relatively new but [very
powerful](https://qz.com/2039292/how-did-chinas-top-internet-regulator-become-so-powerful/)
regulator that [writes the rules governing]{.mark} certain applications
of [AI.]{.mark}]{.underline} The CAC's approach is the most mature, the
most rule-based, and the most concerned with AI's role in disseminating
information. [The CAC made headlines in August 2021 when it released a
[draft [set]{.mark} of [thirty
rules]{.mark}](https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-internet-information-service-algorithmic-recommendation-management-provisions-opinon-seeking-draft/)
[for regulating]{.mark} internet recommendation algorithms, the software
powering everything]{.underline} from TikTok to news apps and search
engines. Some of those rules are China-specific, such as the one
stipulating that recommendation algorithms "vigorously disseminate
positive energy." But other provisions [break
ground](https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/experts-examine-chinas-pioneering-draft-algorithm-regulations/)
in ongoing international debates, such as the requirement that algorithm
providers be able to "[give an
explanation](https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-internet-information-service-algorithmic-recommendation-management-provisions-opinon-seeking-draft/)"
and "remedy" situations in which algorithms have infringed on user
rights and interests. If put into practice, these types of provisions
could spur Chinese companies to experiment with new kinds of disclosure
and methods for algorithmic interpretability, [an [emerging but very
immature](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/key-concepts-in-ai-safety-interpretability-in-machine-learning/)
area of machine learning research]{.underline}. Soon after releasing its
recommendation algorithm rules, the CAC came out with a much more
ambitious effort: a [three-year road
map](http://www.cac.gov.cn/2021-09/29/c_1634507915623047.htm) for
governing all internet algorithms. Following through on that road map
will require input from many of the nine regulators that co-signed the
project, including the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology
(MIIT). [The [second approach]{.mark} to AI governance has emerged out
of the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology
(CAICT), an [influential think tank under the
MIIT](https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/digichina/blog/profile-china-academy-information-and-communications-technology-caict/)]{.underline}.
Active in policy formulation and many aspects of technology testing and
certification, the [[CAICT]{.mark} has distinguished its method through
a [focus on creating the tools for measuring and testing AI]{.mark}
systems]{.underline}. This work remains in its infancy, both from
technical and regulatory perspectives. [But if successful, it [could lay
the foundations for China's larger AI governance]{.mark} regime,
[ensuring]{.mark} that deployed [systems are robust, reliable, and
controllable]{.mark}]{.underline}. In July [[2021,]{.mark} the
[CAICT]{.mark} teamed up with a research lab at the Chinese e-commerce
giant JD to [release]{.mark} the [country's first]{.mark} [[white
paper](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/white-paper-on-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/)
on "trustworthy]{.mark}]{.underline} [AI[.]{.underline}]{.mark}["
Already popular in European and U.S. discussions, trustworthy AI refers
to many of the more technical aspects of AI governance, such as testing
systems for robustness, bias, and explainability. [The way the
CAICT]{.mark} [defines trustworthy AI]{.mark} in its core principles
[[looks very
similar]{.mark}](https://macropolo.org/beijing-approach-trustworthy-ai/?rp=m)
[to]{.mark} the definitions that have come out of [U.S. and European
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}, but the paper was notable for how
quickly those principles are being converted into concrete action. The
CAICT [is working
with](http://aiiaorg.cn/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=show&catid=34&id=115)
China's AI Industry Alliance, a government-sponsored industry body, to
test and certify different kinds of AI systems. In November 2021, it
issued its first batch of [trustworthy AI
certifications](https://www.sohu.com/a/501708742_100207327) for facial
recognition systems. Depending on the technical rigor of implementation,
these types of certifications could help accelerate progress on
algorithmic interpretability---or they could simply turn into a form of
bureaucratic rent seeking. On policy impact, the CAICT is often viewed
as representing the views of the powerful MIIT, but the MIIT's
leadership has yet to issue its own policy documents on trustworthy AI.
Whether it does will be a strong indicator of the bureaucratic momentum
behind this approach. Finally, the [[Ministry of Science and
Technology]{.mark} (MOST) has taken the lightest of the three approaches
to AI governance]{.underline}. [Its highest-profile publications have
focused on [laying down ethical guidelines, relying on companies and
researchers to supervise]{.mark} themselves in applying those principles
to their work.]{.underline} In [July 2021,]{.underline} MOST [published
guidelines](http://www.most.gov.cn/tztg/202107/t20210728_176136.html)
that called for universities, labs, and companies to set up internal
review committees to oversee and adjudicate technology ethics issues.
[[Two months later]{.mark}, the [main AI expert committee]{.mark}
operating under MOST [released]{.mark} its own [[set of ethical norms
for
AI](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/ethical-norms-for-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-released/),]{.mark}
with a [special focus]{.mark} [on weaving ethics into the entire life
cycle of development]{.mark}. Since then, MOST has been encouraging
leading tech companies to establish their own ethics review committees
and audit their own products.]{.underline} MOST's approach is similar to
those of international organizations such as the [United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252510287/Unesco-member-states-adopt-AI-ethics-recommendation)
and the [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development](https://oecd.ai/en/ai-principles), which have released AI
principles and encouraged countries and companies to adopt them. But in
the Chinese context, that tactic feels quite out of step with the
country's increasingly hands-on approach to technology governance, a
disconnect that could undermine the impact of MOST's efforts. One
unanswered question is how these three approaches will fit together.
Chinese ministries and administrative bodies are [notoriously
competitive](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/R41007.pdf) with one another,
constantly jostling to get their pet initiatives in front of the
country's central leadership in hopes that they become the chosen
policies of the party-state. In this contest, the CAC's approach appears
to have the clear upper hand: It is the most mature, the most in tune
with the regulatory zeitgeist, and it comes from the organization with
the most bureaucratic heft. But its approach can't succeed entirely on
its own. The CAC requires that companies be able to explain how their
recommendation algorithms function, and the tools or certifications for
what constitutes explainable AI are likely to come from the CAICT. In
addition, given the sprawling and rapidly evolving nature of the
technology, many practical aspects of trustworthy AI will first surface
in the MOST-inspired ethics committees of individual companies. The
three-year road map for algorithmic governance offers a glimpse of some
bureaucratic collaboration. Though the CAC is clearly the lead author,
the document includes new references to algorithms being trustworthy and
to companies setting up ethics review committees, additions likely made
at the behest of the other two ministries. There may also be substantial
shifts in bureaucratic power as AI governance expands to cover many
industrial and social applications of AI. The CAC is traditionally an
internet-focused regulator, and future regulations for autonomous
vehicles or medical AI may create an opening for a ministry like the
MIIT to seize the regulatory reins. The potential impact of these
regulatory currents extends far beyond China. If the CAC follows through
on certain requirements for algorithmic transparency and explainability,
China will be running some of the world's largest regulatory experiments
on topics that European regulators have [long
debated](https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2018/05/rethinking-explainable-machines-next-chapter-gdprs-right-explanation).
Whether Chinese companies are able to [meet these new
demands](https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/experts-examine-chinas-pioneering-draft-algorithm-regulations/)
could inform analogous debates in Europe over the right to explanation.
On the security side, as AI systems are woven deeper into the fabrics of
militaries around the world, governments want to ensure those systems
are robust, reliable, and controllable for the sake of international
stability. The CAICT's current experiments in certifying AI systems are
likely not game-ready for those kinds of high-stakes deployment
decisions[.]{.underline} But developing an early understanding of how
Chinese institutions and technologists approach these questions could
prove valuable for governments who may soon find themselves negotiating
over aspects of autonomous weapons and arms controls. With 2022 marking
[a major
year](https://thediplomat.com/2020/12/china-looks-ahead-to-20th-party-congress-in-2022/)
in the Chinese political calendar, the people and bureaucracies building
out Chinese AI governance are likely to continue jostling for position
and influence. The results of that jostling warrant close attention from
AI experts and China watchers. If China's attempts to rein in algorithms
prove successful, they could imbue these approaches with a kind of
technological and regulatory soft power that shapes AI governance
regimes around the globe. End of document

of the Internet Information Service Algorithm Recommendation Management
Regulations, [an extensive set of rules -- one of the most fully
developed]{.mark} artificial intelligence [(AI) regulations in the
world]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[designed to govern the use of
A]{.mark}I-based recommendation algorithms]{.underline}. From
[ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) to [Tencent
Holdings](https://www.tencent.com/en-us), companies in China and beyond
are using recommendation algorithms as one of the most [widespread
types](https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/experts-examine-chinas-pioneering-draft-algorithm-regulations/)
of AI in use today. The [[new reg]{.mark}ulation[s]{.mark},]{.underline}
which were published along with a series of related [FAQs for
journalists](http://www.cac.gov.cn/2022-01/04/c_1642894606594726.htm),
are a [[part of China's ongoing efforts to regulate tech]{.mark}nology
platforms in contexts ranging from securities regulation and competition
to data security and privacy]{.underline}. When implemented, the
regulations will have a major impact on companies relying on
recommendation algorithms both inside and outside China. The
regulations, based off a draft promulgated this past summer, clearly
state their goal, to "carry forward the Socialist core value view,
safeguard national security and the social and public interest." They
apply to "algorithmic recommendation service providers" -- i.e.,
companies that use algorithmic technologies to "provide information to
users," such as app operators who use algorithmic recommendations in
their platforms. The regulations require these providers to "uphold
mainstream value orientations, optimize algorithmic recommendation
service mechanisms, vigorously disseminate positive energy, and advance
the use of algorithm upwards and in the direction of good." The
[[reg]{.mark}ulation[s set]{.mark} out a [number of principles]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} are designed to [guide the activity]{.mark} of algorithmic
recommendation service providers. Such [providers must: take "measures
to prevent]{.mark} and curb the [dissemination of harmful
information]{.mark}" including the generation of "fake news"; avoid
setting up algorithmic models that "violate laws and regulations or
ethics and morals]{.underline}, such as by leading users to addiction or
excessive consumption;" and not carry out "monopolistic or improper
competition acts." [[Under the r]{.mark}egulation[s]{.mark}, [providers
must immediately]{.mark} [halt]{.mark} the s[pread of any illegal
info]{.mark}rmation that they discover,]{.underline} effectively placing
responsibility for content moderation on platforms that, in the U.S.,
would be [immune](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230) from civil
liability under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Providers
must not only take corrective actions when illegal information is
discovered, but also report any such discovery to the CAC. Algorithm
providers are further instructed to offer a series of features designed
to protect user rights, including notifying users in a clear manner
about the basic principles, purposes and operational mechanisms of an
algorithm; providing users with a choice "to not target certain of their
individual characteristics"; and installing "convenient and efficient
user complaint and public complaint and reporting access points." To
afford users these rights, developers may need to create an interface
where users can view their profiles and actively select and remove
keywords used by the recommendation algorithm, to test alternative
outcomes. This would be a first for any regulation of algorithms
anywhere in the world. The regulations also contain specific
requirements for services that are provided to minors, stating that
algorithm providers may not provide minors with information that may
incite the imitation of unsafe conduct or lead to "online addiction."
Moreover, the regulations require that providers of algorithm
recommendation services to the elderly must consider the "elderly's
requirement in going out, undergoing medical treatment, consumption,
handling affairs, etc." The regulations also acknowledge labor rights,
specifying that providers of algorithm recommendation services to
workers must guarantee workers' legal rights and interests, such as
renumeration, rest, and vacation. Individuals or organizations that
discover activities that violate these provisions may file a complaint
or report with the government. Relevant government departments may issue
a warning or report and order rectification within a limited time. The
government may impose a fine of between 10,000 and 100,000 yuan (between
\$1,570 and \$15,700, amounts that have doubled since the draft
regulations) if the violations are not corrected or the circumstances
are "grave." Violations may also be prosecuted with criminal liability.
Like the [recently
passed](https://iapp.org/news/a/chinas-pipl-takes-effect-compliance-a-challenge/)
Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), which came into force last
November -- less than three months after it passed in the National
People's Congress -- the regulations will take effect shortly after they
were published, on March 1, 2022. In light of this looming deadline,
companies that rely on algorithms for content recommendations and
targeted advertising, as well as the platforms that provide these
services, should begin to consider how the regulations might affect
their business. Companies that operate both in [China]{.underline} and
overseas may have to [pursue a dual-tracked approach, ensuring that
their Chinese operations comply with the regulations]{.underline} while
maintaining another set of services that align with other countries'
approaches. Nonetheless, [h ow these regulations are enforced and how
companies adapt to their terms will likely affect the global AI
ecosystem.]{.underline}

[The US is set to fund prizes, challenges and research projects to
create so-called "**democracy affirming technologies**" that allow open
societies to reap the benefits of innovation **without sacrificing
privacy or** **accountability**. The initiative will be launched this
week at the virtual Summit for Democracy, a meeting of 111 invited
countries convened by president Joe Biden in an **attempt to "renew"

include methods of machine learning that respect the privacy of
individuals, or alternatives to what the US sees as the compulsory
genomic surveillance of populations. "We're really interested in ways we
could spur innovation and pioneer a new class of technologies," Tarun
Chhabra, senior director for technology and national security of the US
National Security Council told the virtual conference, 'Technology in
and for Society', hosted by the OECD. [These technologies should
"advance the values of privacy, **transparency**, accountability and
access to information]{.underline}" he said, setting out the objectives
of the programme on Monday, in advance of the Summit on 9 and 10
December. The US wants to set up prizes, challenges and pilot projects
"with likeminded countries" in order to "build a future where we can
really accelerate the development of technologies," Chhabra said.

Untested proposition

The concept of democracy-affirming technology will be launched with a
panel discussion at the Summit for Democracy on 8 December. "It's an
untested proposition whether technologies built with democratic values
at their core ---\'democracy-affirming technology' --- can be as
powerful, profitable, or even as entertaining as those which threaten to
undermine rules-based governance today," reads the event description,
which [will focus on technology that can "**asymmetrically advantage
democratic values**]{.underline}". Pressed for more examples of such
technologies, Chhabra said that the US has concerns about the way in
which "some biotechnologies are being used for mass and compulsory
genomic surveillance" with "very uncertain policies around how that data
may be used." [Democracies need to create alternatives that allow
societies to reap the health benefits of genomic
technology]{.underline}, but without the surveillance downsides, he
said. The US hopes to "show what the potential of that kind of
technology could be, and work with industry to ensure trying to develop
it, and then work through associated challenges related to standards,"
he said. The concept of democracy-affirming technology is a relatively
new and unused one, but the term does appear in a report released last
year by the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a task force of US experts
convened to formulate a strategy to "offset autocratic advances in
non-military domains of competition". "[The US should work with other
democracies to take a more active role in **shaping global technology
governance** to ensure that norms, standards, and new technologies are
conducive to democracy rather than corrosive to it,]{.underline}"
concludes Linking Values and Strategy. It mentions "[explainable and low
data **artificial intelligence**" as one such technology **democracies
should pursue**.]{.underline} There should also be "guardrails" on
applications that might threaten democratic values, like facial
recognition, mass data collection, and surveillance technologies, the
report says. It also makes the case for more state intervention in
technology development, [so that new breakthroughs bolster, rather than
undermine, democracy.]{.underline} "A hands-off approach to technology
governance has made it easier for autocracies to shape standards and
norms," it warns. Apart from promoting democracy-affirming technology at
this week's summit, the [US will also rachet up export controls on
technologies that could undermine democracy.]{.underline}

Over the coming year, said Chhabra, the US wants to assemble a group of
"likeminded" countries that will "commit together to determine how
export control tools could better monitor, and as appropriate restrict,
the proliferation of technologies." He said there was a "broader
surveillance stack" of technologies that are "of concern". Drawing up
the guest list for the summit has proven controversial, however. To
China's anger, Taiwan has been invited. Hungary is not on the guest
list, but Poland is, despite the country's ongoing rule of law disputes
with Brussels. On December 8, the White House announced further details
of the agenda, unveiling a series of "International Grand Challenges on
Democracy-Affirming Technologies". These will [include prize challenges
to develop privacy-enhancing technologies that "**harness the power of
data** in a secure manner that **protects privacy and intellectual
property,** enabling cross-border and cross-sector collaboration to
solve shared challenges."]{.underline}. They will be run jointly by the
US and UK. Also supported will be challenges to create tools that can
circumvent online censorship and get around internet shutdowns. "It's
not a guarantee that any given technology will support democratic
values," said Eric Lander, president Biden's science advisor in a
statement. "It takes constant vigilance, and constant commitment; we,
the people, have to [make sure that technology is developed responsibly
and used responsibly. That is our solemn obligation]{.underline}."

A sneak peek of Joe Biden\'s national AI strategy: here\'s what to
expect

\"[Continued American **leadership in AI** is of paramount **importance
to maintaining** the **economic and national security of the U**nited
**S**tates and to **shaping the global evolution of AI** in a manner
consistent with our Nation\'s values, policies, and
priorities]{.underline}.\" President Donald J. Trump, February 11, 2019.
Although the Trump administration launched the first-ever national AI
strategy a few years earlier, it was not until Joe Biden took office
that [federal AI spending reached historic high.]{.underline} Through
2021, Washington could invest \$6 billion into AI-related R&D projects
and initiatives. The country\'s renewed interest in artificial
intelligence is largely ignited by Biden\'s plan to challenge China and
its views on AI usage. In the spring of 2022, the National Artificial
Intelligence Research Task Force is set to present an interim report
highlighting the national artificial intelligence strategy and
implementation plan, with the full report expected later that year.
[Experts believe that the US AI strategy will cover complex scientific,
economic, social, and security issues of artificial intelligence and the
associated technologies, such as data storage and processing
platforms.]{.underline}

The government wants America to lead the artificial intelligence race

A 2020 AI survey conducted by RELX indicates that 82% of Americans \"are
somewhat or very concerned\" about other countries being more advanced
in AI than the United States. And there\'s no smoke without fire.
Although the United States is still leading the artificial intelligence
race, China boasts superior monitoring and surveillance technologies,
which are often used to suppress its citizens and control other
countries\' information flows. [Instead of strengthening
authoritarianism, US companies and governmental agencies are focused on
the commercial applications of artificial intelligence]{.underline}.
Simply put, [America would rather have advanced self-driving vehicles
than an AI-powered version of Orwell\'s Big Brother. And **Biden\'s**
national **AI strategy** will]{.underline} most likely [**become a
counterpoint to how China believes** the **tech**nology **should be
used**.]{.underline} Several steps have already been taken in this
direction. The US National Security Commission on Artificial
Intelligence (NSCAI), an independent organization established in 2018 to
spur artificial intelligence development in the country, urges the
government to form strategic partnerships with private companies and
fellow democracies. In addition, NSCAI believes the new administration
needs to allot \$40 billion to further expand and democratize R&D
activities in the AI field. [The US government is also looking to
establish a Technology Competitiveness Council to create national
strategies for seven emerging technologies, including artificial
intelligence. In particular, US officials are interested in leveraging
AI to prevent the malicious use of biotechnology, including genomic
weapons.]{.underline} In light of Biden\'s decision to order a new
investigation into the origins of COVID-19 --- some theories suggest
that the virus was created in a laboratory and released through an
accidental leak --- the country\'s priorities do not come as a surprise.

**US leadership is essential in maintaining [positive]{.underline} AI
innovation---preventing human rights violations and
[adversarial]{.underline} applications.**

AI a Welcome Development,\" Center for Data Innovation,
https://datainnovation.org/2020/07/u-s-global-leadership-on-ai-a-welcome-development/\]

[The U.S. government announced on May 27 that it was joining the Global
Partnership on AI (GPAI), a group launched by the G7 to provide
cooperation between nations on artificial intelligence.]{.underline}
This is a sharp change of course for the United States which had held
out on joining the group initially out of concern that its European
allies would use the forum to push for aggressive regulation of the
technology without clear evidence of harms. Instead, [the group is now
set up to focus on the responsible development of AI, including by
developing research agendas, promoting AI workforce development, and
spurring AI innovation and commercialization, while ensuring these uses
align with shared democratic values. The U.S. presence on the global
stage in AI policy is a welcome step]{.underline} because it provides an
alternative to the two dominant views. [On one side is China, which has
made bold commitments in its national AI strategy to leverage the
technology across its]{.underline} entire [economy and]{.underline} use
this [to be more competitive economically and militarily.]{.underline}
However, [many are concerned that China's authoritarian
government]{.underline} will also [abuse the technology to infringe on
human rights, including by monitoring dissidents and minority
communities.]{.underline} On the other side is [the EU,]{.underline}
which has [embraced the precautionary principle and wants to strictly
regulate the use of AI because of fears that the technology
will]{.underline} otherwise [be used for harmful purposes.]{.underline}

[The United States presents an alternative view---unlike China it wants
to protect democratic values, and unlike the EU it wants to proceed
without an overly burdensome regulatory regime. U.S. leadership on
digital policy issues has always been important]{.underline}. For
example, [in the 1990s the U.S. government championed the
multistakeholder approach to Internet governance, creating a balance
between the different needs of government, commercial, and civil society
stakeholders.]{.underline} [For many years, the U.S. government has
backed a free and open Internet, helping to resist efforts by other
countries to censor content online and impose data localization
requirements.]{.underline} Today, the AI economy needs such advocacy
even more, as its expansion and evolution depends on the ability of
technology firms to operate across borders. For instance, the EU's data
laws that restrict algorithmic decision making inhibit firms from
selling AI products and services that automate many processes. [The
United States could influence its other trading partners to avoid
adopting such harmful policies by advancing a light-touch regulatory
framework that instead fosters algorithmic accountability.]{.underline}
Forums like GPAI present an opportunity for the United States to
demonstrate that regulations should be adopted only where they are
necessary and only targeting specific harms in particular application
areas. [This approach will allow for more rapid adoption of AI and
faster economic and social progress.]{.underline} [Working with other
countries to address issues arising from the misuse of AI products will
serve the United States well]{.underline} at home too. For example, [in
response to the flagrant abuse of facial recognition technology in China
to target the predominantly Muslim Uighur minority, the United States
could engage its geopolitical partners to share resources, expertise,
and best practices on establishing global norms on ethical uses of
AI.]{.underline} By establishing proper guardrails, rather than enacting
misguided bans or innovation-hampering regulation, [the United States
can prevent consumer backlash that impedes the growth of beneficial AI
technologies. Establishing such consensus with allied nations is
particularly important in balancing global power dynamics in AI
development.]{.underline} Chinese government officials and the country's
industry leaders made it clear in their call for stronger global
collaboration in AI this month, that they intend to strengthen their
ties with other AI leaders. By joining GPAI, the United States is
strengthening its own alliance with like-minded democratic partners, and
providing a counterweight to China's growing economic and political
power. Beyond protecting against threats to U.S. economic and national
security, [GPAI also provides an opportunity for the United States to
ensure American values, rather than Chinese ones, prevail on the global
scale]{.underline}. There are more commonalities in values and
principles among the G7 group than there are divergences, and the United
States is correct in thinking that promoting these values---including
diversity, inclusion, and civil liberties--- is stronger when
coordinated. [Working together, the group will support the development
of AI that integrates shared democratic values and can ultimately ensure
these values supersede those of China and other autocratic
countries.]{.underline} GPAI is still in the early days of establishing
international cooperation, but the United States' involvement is an
encouraging step towards achieving its vision of economic growth,
competitive advantage, and social progress.

**Spread of Chinese AI leadership would undermine international human
rights and target towards minorities**

**CFDS 19** \[Center for Digital Society (CfDS) is a research center
under the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, University of Gadjah
Mada. 7-11-2019, \"China: Where Technology Threatens Human Rights :

China's rate of technological advancement has been one of the highest in
the world. Currently, it is on the 3rd rank of AI ecosystem
development\[1\]. Moreover, the government even already set the target
to be the world's AI leader by 2030, tackling the US technological
leadership\[2\]. This goal was established to maximize the advantages
that technology has and will bring towards China, mainly on economic
development. However, as many have argued, the Chinese model could
succeed because it could maintain the stability of the country by
repressing the citi\[an1\] \[TA2\] \[TA3\] zen's rights through the
central planning system. As a result, the government is not hesitant to
utilize technology to preserve the balance of the government. Thus, this
has also increased international concerns. This commentary will discuss
the reasons behind these concerns.

China's Mass Surveillance Application

In February 2018, [Human Rights Watch found out that an application
named IJOP is used by authorities to gather citizen's data and
behavior]{.underline} including the [ability to create alerts towards
the government if the application algorithm deemed the person to be
threatening and required further investigation.]{.underline} [One of the
usage of IJOP is towards the minorities in China such as the Turkic
Muslims and ethnic Uyghurs in Xinjiang.]{.underline} Even before IJOP,
[these groups have been exposed to various measures of detention to
integrate them towards the society including in the prohibition of
massively expressing their beliefs or identities in
public]{.underline}\[3\]. Some of the actions and behaviors that are
considered suspicious by the algorithm are the usage of VPN or other
banned applications in China, the conduct of religious practices without
government consent, the usage of electricity surpasses the typical
usage, the possession of a mobile phone that is not registered, etc.
These data are manually inputted to the system by officers who interview
citizens. Besides manual data input, the application could also gather
data from Wi-Fi networks. After processing the data, IJOP could create
alerts and assigns different police levels which citizens they must
interrogate or bring to political detention\[4\].

China's Social Rating System

[The social rating system in China aims to maintain harmony in the
society and ensuring the citizens to behave appropriately by
incentivizing good behavior while penalizing the bad.]{.underline}
[Taking the data from private companies, CCTV, government records, and
so forth, the social rating system gives an ID to a person, and they
will be scored based on their behavior.]{.underline} For example, [if
someone violates specific laws such as not paying government money or
disturb society by being too loud in public, they could lose some of
their rights]{.underline}. There are v\[an4\] \[TA5\] \[an6\] arious
pilot projects of this social rating system with different lists of good
and bad behavior, [along with the associated rewards and
punishment]{.underline}\[5\].

Conclusion

Although both applications are not yet nationally used in China, [they
already **show significant violations towards human rights**, mainly
towards the rights of privacy and the presumption of innocence unless
proven otherwise]{.underline}. In both systems, the [**algorithm
becomes** the **deciding factor for** whether a person should be
**penalized** or not]{.underline}. These [contradict the principles
underlying the international human rights treaties that China has agreed
such as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Racial Discrimination]{.underline}\[6\]. Both cases have shown how
[**technology could massively be used** to secure society **at the
expense of** their human **rights**]{.underline}. Although this happened
in China that most labeled for not being under democracy, [everyone has
the same human rights regardless of their nationality. Therefore, they
have the absolute right to be protected]{.underline}. Moreover,
[prevention of the adoption of such a system in other countries must be
done as actually the social credit system has been implemented in banks
and other institutions]{.underline} but not as detailed as the Chinese
case\[7\]. All in all, the case of [China rises concerns towards the
international human rights treaties in order to adapt and enforce human
rights both offline and online.]{.underline}

[**[China]{.mark}** is [going to develop superior a]{.mark}rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence [and take over the world]{.mark}]{.underline}, it
seems---at least if one listens to what many commentators have been
shouting from the rooftops. Indeed, over the past year, [**American
security analysts**, policymakers, and journalists alike have
**increasingly used a Cold War-era analogy to describe issues around the
development of**]{.underline} artificial [intelligence
**(AI)---**]{.underline}specifically [[characterizing]{.mark} the [state
of U.S.-China technological competition as an "**AI arms
race**,"]{.mark}]{.underline}1 whereby the United States and China are
presumably [[lock]{.mark}ed [in]{.mark} [comp]{.mark}etition [for
**a**]{.mark}rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence
**[heg]{.mark}emony**]{.underline}.2 "Ultimately, we will win the race
for AI," President Trump's Deputy Assistant for Technology Policy
Michael Kratsios recently wrote.3 Talk of U.S.-China "algorithm battles"
even made it into a 2018 U.S. National Security Council memo.4 Here, the
[framing is clearly winner-takes-all: [One nation]{.mark} [will
reap]{.mark} [the **benefits** of a]{.mark}rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence, in fashions as wide-ranging as [**accelerated
economic growth** and **enhanced military capability**, while the other
loses out and faces defeat]{.mark}.]{.underline} But this framing of
artificial intelligence is not only wrong, it's dangerous, and it
seriously hampers the ways in which American policymakers approach the
management of China's technological rise and the development of
artificial intelligence within our country. [The [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [needs to **quickly address China's growing A**I]{.mark}
development; [a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence [will]{.mark}
have important [influence]{.mark} over the **[balance of
int]{.mark}ernational** **[power]{.mark}**5 [and]{.mark} the **[future
world order6]{.mark}** ---]{.underline}but, as this report will address,
a winner-takes-all arms race framing is not the appropriate lens through
which to view this strategic threat. The first chapter argues why this
winner-takes-all arms race framing treats AI development as if it occurs
in vacuums within the United States and China. By ignoring the
interconnection and interdependence of the sectors between the two
countries, this framing causes American policymakers to overlook the
many mutual benefits that could arise from the furthering of global
artificial intelligence capabilities. As a result, policymakers in the
United States risk causing damage to AI development, missing
opportunities, and mishandling AI risks---when they should focus on
engaging with China on AI projects without giving up critical expertise
or technologies that could potentially enhance harmful applications of
artificial intelligence. The second chapter argues why this framing
incorrectly treats artificial intelligence like one technology, rather
than a catch-all term that alludes to a variety of technologies. This is
blatantly wrong and overlooks the varying speeds and mechanisms of AI's
development in different application areas. Once again, American
policymakers may mishandle AI risks and miss out on AI upsides as a
result.

### 2ac -- Democracy ! Defense

#### Covid thumps democracy and they can't overcome it

**Repucci and Slipowitz 20** -- Amy Slipowitz is the Research Manager
for Freedom in the World, Freedom House's flagship annual report
assessing the condition of political rights and civil liberties around
the world. Sarah Repucci is vice-president of research and analysis at
Freedom House. ( Repucci, Sarah, and Amy Slipowitz. "Democracy under
Lockdown." Freedom House, 2020,
https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown.
)

The [COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic [has fueled **a crisis for
democracy**]{.underline} around the world. Since the [coronavirus
outbreak began, the condition of democracy and human rights has grown
worse in 80 countries]{.underline}. [Governments have responded by
engaging in abuses of power, silencing their critics, and weakening or
shuttering important institutions]{.underline}, often undermining the
very systems of accountability needed to protect public health.

This is the conclusion of new Freedom House research on the impact of
COVID-19 on democracy and human rights, produced in partnership with the
survey firm GQR. Based on a survey of 398 journalists, civil society
workers, activists, and other experts as well as research on 192
countries by Freedom House's global network of analysts, this report is
the first of its kind and the most in-depth effort to date to examine
the condition of democracy during the pandemic (see full methodology).

The research strongly supports the hypothesis that the
[COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic [is exacerbating the 14 years of
consecutive decline in freedom]{.underline}. Not only has democracy
weakened in 80 countries, but [the problem is particularly acute in
struggling democracies and highly repressive states]{.underline}---in
other words, [settings that already had weak safeguards against abuse of
power are suffering the most]{.underline}. The findings illustrate the
breadth and depth of the assault on democracy. As one respondent on
Cambodia put it, "The government \[took\] coronavirus as the opportunity
to demolish democratic space."

[Sri Lanka's]{.underline} experience illustrates the global trends. The
government of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa [accelerated its
authoritarian agenda]{.underline} over the past six months, [stepping up
efforts to control independent reporting and unfavorable speech by
ordering the arrest of anyone who criticizes or contradicts the official
line]{.underline} on the coronavirus. Early elections were called but,
as the outbreak accelerated, were postponed, leaving the [national
legislature out of session beyond the constitutional deadline and
weakening checks on executive power]{.underline}. [Health concerns were
also exploited by authorities as a pretext for human rights abuses,
especially against the minority Muslim population]{.underline}.

The crisis of democratic governance, having begun long before the
pandemic, is likely to continue after the health crisis recedes, as the
**[laws and norms being put in place now will be difficult to
reverse]{.underline}**. Among the experts surveyed, 64 percent agreed
that the impact of COVID-19 on democracy and human rights in their
country of focus will be mostly negative over the next three to five
years. [China's experience]{.underline} over the past nine months [could
prove a dystopian model for the future:]{.underline} increased
nationalist and propagandistic rhetoric at home in an effort to drown
out calls for transparency and accountability, enhanced and innovative
technological surveillance, crackdowns on individuals within and outside
the country who share information that contradicts regime messaging, and
the persecution of potential critics among the domestic elite.

Yet even amid devastation and disruption, some have responded to the
pandemic with hope and rejuvenation. Journalism has thrived in certain
countries as people seek out factual information, and investigative
reporting has persisted in several of the most hostile environments. As
one expert on Cuba said, "Activists and independent journalists have
been willing to risk fines and imprisonment to report accurately on what
is taking place in the country." Civil society organizations have also
worked tirelessly to maintain accountability in face of new challenges.
And the mishandling of the crisis by many governments has spurred
demands for change, most notably in Belarus, where mass protests that
began in August have blossomed into a major movement for political
reform. Democracy is suffering around the world, but the public's demand
for it has not been extinguished.

\"Democracy is suffering around the world, but the public's demand for
it has not been extinguished.\"

The following report summarizes the results of Freedom House's research
into the impact of COVID-19 on democracy and human rights from January
to August 2020. It describes [**five aspects** of accountability that
have been weakened: **checks against abuses of power, protection of
vulnerable groups, transparency and anticorruption, free media and
expression, and credible elections**]{.underline}. It concludes with a
summary of the reasons for hope and a set of recommendations, along with
the report methodology.

Among survey respondents, 27 percent reported government abuse of power
as one of the three issues most affected by the coronavirus outbreak.
Officials and security services perpetrated violence against civilians,
detained people without justification, and overstepped their legal
authority. Governments are also using the pandemic as a justification to
grant themselves special powers beyond what is reasonably necessary to
protect public health. They have then exploited these emergency powers
to interfere in the justice system, impose unprecedented restrictions on
political opponents, and undermine crucial legislative functions. As one
respondent said of Turkey, "Coronavirus was used as an excuse for the
already oppressive government to do things that it has long planned to
do, but had not been able to."

Freedom House research found evidence of police violence against
civilians in at least 59 countries. Most of the violence occurred in
less democratic settings, with 49 percent of Partly Free countries and
41 percent of Not Free countries under review experiencing such
abuses.[1](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown#footnote1_4i3fctf)  Detentions
and arrests linked to the pandemic response were noted in at least 66
countries, including 49 percent of Partly Free countries and 54 percent
of Not Free countries. In Egypt, classified as Not Free, one expert
noted, "The military regime has used COVID-19 as an opportunity to
further repress political activists, rights defenders, lawyers,
journalists, and doctors, arresting dozens, denying them basic
assistance in places of detention, and placing several on terrorist
lists."

The high rates of abuse by authorities in Partly Free countries likely
indicate that governments with both a relatively active opposition and
weak checks on their own power perceive a greater need and opportunity
to resort to violence. One Partly Free country, Liberia, experienced
"brutal and corrupt enforcement of curfew orders by security forces." In
another, Zimbabwe, "COVID-19 has also been used to arrest, abduct, rape,
assault, and intimidate human rights activists, opposition party
leaders/supporters, civil society leaders, journalists, and other
dissenting voices on 'allegations of violating lockdown conditions.'"

Surveillance has greatly increased during the pandemic, and broad
monitoring can easily become excessive and intimidating. For example, a
respondent on the Philippines reported that authorities have visited the
homes of individuals who may have been exposed to the virus, and arrests
are frequently carried out for violations as simple as not wearing a
mask while crossing a border. In Sri Lanka, a survey respondent
described the "house-to-house collection of household-level information
by the police, accompanied by military intelligence."

Many experts also detailed crackdowns on opposition figures or the
judiciary. In Kazakhstan, "there is an increase in the persecution of
civic activists and political opposition for expressing their critical
opinions on social media or disseminating information about human rights
violations, including through the initiation of criminal cases." In
Cambodia, "\[Prime Minister\] Hun Sen's government has used COVID-19 to
bolster its crackdown on the political opposition." In Azerbaijan, "the
government has used the pretext of breaking quarantine to crack down on
opposition political activists." In Guatemala, the "pandemic has been
utilized to continue attacks against the rule of law. The country is in
the process of electing magistrates to \[the\] highest courts and
corrupt and criminal groups are looking to rig the process." In Serbia,
"the judiciary has become a puppet of the executive branch, trials are
being...conducted via video link, without the presence of defense
attorneys."

At the same time, parliaments have been hamstrung by health restrictions
and emergency laws, and at times manipulated for political purposes. One
respondent on Singapore noted that the most disturbing development has
been the "passage of laws that curb freedom but claim to curb the
virus." Almost 4 in 10 (39 percent) of the surveyed experts,
representing 65 countries, said meetings of the national legislature
were canceled for at least part of the pandemic.

Such abuses may reflect a government's fear of losing power, rather than
confidence in its own strength. Overall, 57 percent of respondents felt
that governing parties in their country of focus have grown weaker since
the start of the coronavirus outbreak, compared with only 27 percent who
believe they are stronger. In the countries where democracy was seen as
weakening this year, experts were likely---by a margin of 6 percentage
points---to see governing parties in a stronger position, as in
Bangladesh, Burundi, Poland, and Sri Lanka. However, this apparent
"bump" for governing parties in democratically declining countries
represents only a fraction of the gains enjoyed by governing parties in
better-performing countries where there are high rates of approval for
the national government's response to the coronavirus, or where the
economy is strong, such as Estonia.

The survey findings highlighted two countries that are not long-standing
democracies yet have resisted imposing widely abusive measures in
response to the coronavirus outbreak. The 10 experts who responded to
the survey on Tunisia, which became a Free country in Freedom in the
World 2015, all expressed approval of the national government's handling
of the outbreak. At the time of this writing, virus cases were on the
rise, and there have been reports of police abuse and arbitrary
enforcement of lockdown measures, but officials have refrained from
serious infringements on fundamental freedoms. In Georgia, which remains
a Partly Free country, the government has been widely commended among
the population for imposing strict, but transparent, measures to tackle
the pandemic. Georgia has had one of the lowest death rates globally,
resulting in a significant popularity boost for the ruling Georgian
Dream party ahead of October elections. These cases are a reminder that
any country can take steps to manage health risks while respecting human
rights.

Abuses of power during the pandemic have had a disproportionate impact
on communities that were already marginalized. Among the experts
surveyed, 29 percent said a lack of protection for minorities and
vulnerable populations was one of three issues most affected by the
coronavirus response; 25 percent said new or increased restrictions on
ethnic and religious minorities have been put in place as a result of
the coronavirus outbreak in their countries of focus. In some cases,
these groups suffered disproportionately because their status put them
at greater risk. But the dearth of accountability precipitated by
weakened independent media or acquiescent legislative and judicial
branches has allowed both state and nonstate actors to discriminate
against certain groups with impunity.

In some countries, lockdown measures have been applied in an openly
discriminatory manner to specific segments of the population. In
Bulgaria, Romany neighborhoods were placed under harsher movement
restrictions than areas where Roma did not constitute a majority. In
Kuwait, authorities put greater restrictions on noncitizen neighborhoods
than on areas where mostly citizens live. Criminal and rebel groups have
also used the pandemic as a pretext to prey on marginalized communities.
In Colombia, according to a survey respondent, "ethnic minorities had to
completely withdraw into their shelters to protect themselves from the
virus and with that they found themselves at the mercy of...illegal
armed groups."

Marginalized groups have faced disproportionate sanctions. In the United
Kingdom, news media have reported that Black people and people of Asian
descent are detained at higher rates than white residents under new
police powers. In Turkey, a respondent claimed that "police violence
under the cover of COVID-19 audits and checks disproportionately targets
minorities."

\"The military has intensified attacks in ethnic areas related to less
international scrutiny due to coronavirus."

Governments and societies have continued to use marginalized groups as
scapegoats, blaming them for spreading the virus. India's Muslims were
labeled "superspreaders" and subjected to "a vicious hate campaign" in
response to news of an Islamic religious gathering in New Delhi that was
linked to an outbreak of COVID-19. Similarly, in Sri Lanka, "Muslims
were treated as superspreaders with some members of government blaming
Muslims for people not being able to celebrate the Sinhala and Tamil New
Year," and "the media would highlight cases where the patients were of a
minority community." Moreover, against their religious customs and
despite World Health Organization recommendations stating that burials
were acceptable, Sri Lankan Muslims were ordered to cremate those in
their community who died after contracting the virus. In Montenegro,
"the government and its media used the opportunity to label any
religious protest gatherings, especially those of the members of the
Serbian Orthodox Church, as reckless if not outright intentional
attempts to spread the coronavirus and undermine the ruling regime."

In Costa Rica, already marginalized Nicaraguan migrants and refugees who
work in the agricultural sector are reportedly viewed by many as
contributing to the spread of COVID-19. In Serbia, "the anti-migrant
atmosphere has grown...as migrants were portrayed as possible carriers
of the virus." A respondent on Turkey noted that "the declaration by
\[the\] Directorate of Religious Affairs \[said\] that the LGBTI+
individuals are responsible for spreading the virus around the world as
the damned group by God."

Specific pandemic-related policies and practices have also targeted
refugees who are already fleeing persecution. The Malaysian government
"falsely promis\[ed\] no action on refugees for taking Covid tests, but
later ended up arresting and detaining many to be deported." Journalists
attempting to expose conditions for refugees amid the pandemic have been
muzzled in several countries.

As international attention remains focused on combatting the
coronavirus, governments and other actors have been able to escalate
ongoing abuses against vulnerable groups with little scrutiny. In
Myanmar, where the International Court of Justice has ordered the
government to prevent genocide against the Rohingya and mobile internet
access has been largely restricted since June 2019, "The military has
intensified attacks in ethnic areas, which can be related to less
international scrutiny due to coronavirus. This has caused mass
displacement and grave human rights violations, particularly in western
Myanmar." Local civil society groups and other stakeholders similarly
have less capacity to hold perpetrators accountable for rights
violations not directly linked to the pandemic response.

Despite these grave developments, some bright spots have appeared. The
government in Portugal, for instance, granted migrants temporary
citizenship rights so they could secure public services. A respondent
for Tunisia said that the government and the people "provided aid to all
needy minorities and refugees, especially \[those\] from Syria and
Africans." Sustained, inclusive measures have the potential to pave the
way for greater equality after the health crisis has subsided, which in
turn can foster better outcomes for future crises.

Authoritarian and democratically elected leaders alike have failed to be
candid about the impact of the coronavirus. Among the surveyed experts,
37 percent, representing 65 countries, named government transparency and
information about coronavirus as one of the three issues most affected
by the response to the pandemic. In fact, shortcomings in transparency
and official information ranked highest among the 15 issues suggested to
respondents. For experts focused on countries that Freedom in the
World classifies as Not Free, the response was even stronger, with 46
percent citing transparency as a chief concern.

Experts from around the world expressed broad skepticism of government
information on the coronavirus. A 62 percent majority of survey
respondents said they distrust what they are hearing about the pandemic
from the national government in their country of focus, and among Not
Free countries, 77 percent distrust such information. Respondents
expressed slightly more confidence about information from local
governments, but a 53 percent majority distrusts these sources as well.
About half (52 percent) of respondents, representing 66 countries, said
the virus has "led to a proliferation of disinformation coming from the
government." For example, a respondent on Poland saw "politicians making
unfounded statements not based on actual data, and when challenged,
claiming they have never said such a thing and that their words have
been taken out of context." These attitudes toward government stand in
contrast to opinions about the media: a 56 percent majority of
respondents have confidence in what the media in their country are
reporting about the virus.

In open-ended written responses to the survey, some experts referred to
outright government denial of the virus, as in countries including
Nicaragua and Turkmenistan, or promotion of unsafe or unproven
treatments, in countries such as Brazil and Tanzania. In a chilling
response to a question about the most disturbing practice they have
seen, one expert said, "Dead bodies buried at night."

The survey corroborates the idea that corruption thrives when
transparency declines; 31 percent of respondents representing 45
countries included "corruption and money in politics" among the top
three issues they see as most affected by the pandemic response. Massive
government outlays to assist with public health and the economy, often
distributed hastily with no meaningful mechanisms in place to monitor
the funds, have provided opportunities for corruption. For example, in
Mauritania, "the ministers of the ruling party used COVID funds to make
donations on behalf of the prime minister." Other experts shared stories
about the disappearance of supplies, or suspicious contracts with
uncertified medical providers. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a
raspberry farm infamously won a state contract to acquire ventilators,
"companies not registered for medical services were registered overnight
to participate in embezzlement of huge funds for purchase of medical
equipment of suspicious origin."

As the pandemic drags on, public attention will inevitably turn
elsewhere, permitting even further abuses to go unchecked. The burden of
preventing degraded norms from taking hold will largely fall on
democracy advocates and independent journalists, who must continue to
place pressure on governments to remain transparent and adhere to the
rule of law.

Independent media have often been stifled during the pandemic, making
accountability difficult and hampering the dissemination of vital
information. Based on Freedom House research, at least 91 of 192
countries (47 percent) experienced restrictions on the news media as
part of the response to the coronavirus outbreak. The media in 62
percent of Partly Free countries and 67 percent of Not Free countries
under review experienced such constraints.

Journalists covering the crisis have been arrested and targeted with
violence, harassment, and intimidation. Governments have exerted control
over content, revoked outlets' registrations, suspended printing of
newspapers, denied press credentials, and limited independent
questioning at press conferences. New legislation against spreading
"fake news" about the virus has been passed, while websites have been
blocked and online articles or social media posts removed. The increased
public need for impartial information during a pandemic makes such
varied methods of suppression particularly egregious.

"I am more cautious in publicly criticising government responses on
COVID-19."

In addition to specific controls on the news media, government
restrictions on free speech and criticism of the government have been
imposed in at least 72 countries (38 percent); 56 percent of Partly Free
and 57 percent of Not Free countries under review saw limits on free
expression. As one respondent on Kyrgyzstan said, "Medical workers who
openly spoke out about the problems they encountered were forced to
apologize and recant their claims on video." In response to how their
work has been affected by the pandemic, a respondent on Bangladesh
stated, "I am more cautious in publicly criticising government responses
on COVID-19."

Freedom of expression and belief has precipitously deteriorated during
the 14 consecutive years of decline in overall global freedom observed
by Freedom in the World. The pandemic has aggravated this negative
trajectory, particularly in countries where independent journalism was
already under pressure. In Rwanda, where severe legal restrictions are
in place and a journalist went missing last year, there has been "a lot
of restriction in matters of independent reporting from non-government
institutions. Some journalist\[s\] who were broadcasting via \[YouTube\]
channels were arrested, and others have been reprimanded from covering
issues of COVID-19."

Several countries that experienced a large decline in freedom during
2019[2](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown#footnote1_2jqfehx) have
imposed new or increased restrictions on the media since the outbreak
began. One of these countries is Tanzania, where the media has
effectively been barred from covering the pandemic. Another is Nigeria,
where a respondent wrote that there have been "increased cases of
journalists detained for their opinions of government policies," while
the presidency has limited accreditations for press conferences.

These intentional restrictions help enable governments to act with
impunity, sometimes with the assistance of a subservient legislature or
judiciary. Even when governments seem to be providing accurate
information, quarantines and restrictions on travel may hinder the
ability of the media to monitor and question them. In the words of a
Lebanon respondent, "during lock\[down\] the government at first did not
allow the journalist\[s\]...to move freely, they had to get special
permits."

Governments and citizens must recognize that press freedoms and freedom
of expression are essential tools for exposing misconduct and assessing
the effectiveness of the pandemic response. Public health depends on the
protection of these core democratic values.

National elections in nine countries, and many more subnational votes,
were disrupted in some way between January and August 2020, with
frequent accusations that decisions on election administration had been
politicized. Given the rapid onset of the pandemic and the acute health
risks it posed to voters, postponements were not always unreasonable.
Yet such moves frequently failed to meet democratic standards, either
because new elections were not scheduled promptly or because officials
set new dates without making adequate preparations for safe and secure
voting.

Among the 24 countries that had a national election planned during the
period under review, 22 nationwide votes took place. Seven countries
moved an election date, including three that did not immediately plan
for new elections, though they eventually set new dates. COVID-19
provoked changes in election rules in four countries, damaging the
credibility of the elections in two cases. There were 13 countries that
introduced alternative voting methods that minimized health risks.

In Sri Lanka, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa dissolved the
opposition-controlled parliament in March in a bid to hold early
parliamentary elections in April. Due to the health crisis, however, the
country was unable to conduct the elections within the constitutional
timeframe of three months. Five months ultimately passed before the
balloting was held in August, during which the president ruled without a
legislature. Rajapaksa's party won the elections in a landslide, adding
to fears that he and his brother, former president and current prime
minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, would consolidate power and build an
authoritarian regime.

Other votes also seemed designed to tighten an authoritarian grip.
Burundi's election went ahead on May 20 with few health precautions for
the population, yet foreign observers were required to quarantine;
conveniently for the ruling party, none showed up. According to an
expert on Belarus, where a fraudulent election has led to ongoing mass
protests, "The authorities, having done nothing to stop the spread of
the coronavirus, used the epidemic solely to limit the rights of
citizens during the election campaign," including by restricting
international and local observers. 

Elections were postponed in Ethiopia and Bolivia, dashing hopes that
voting would bring clarity to transitional situations. In Ethiopia,
reformist prime minister Abiy Ahmed took power in 2018 through an
internal party process, and Parliament's term was set to expire in
October 2020. The government decided this spring that the coronavirus
necessitated an indefinite electoral delay. This has led to political
unrest and fears of a return to authoritarian rule.

In Bolivia, the incumbent government was meant to serve on an interim
basis after protests against a seriously flawed vote led former
president Evo Morales to flee the country in November 2019. Yet the
special election was postponed three times, ostensibly due to the
coronavirus. (It was scheduled for October 18 at the time of writing.)
Critics of the caretaker president---who is also a presidential
candidate---see her handling of the health situation as politically
motivated. As one respondent said of Bolivia, "The coronavirus arrived
at a moment of democratic fragility, since our country was in the midst
of a governmental transition pending new elections...this once again
threw the country into a state of social upheaval."

In Hong Kong, where prodemocracy protests against Beijing's growing
control have persisted for more than a year, legislative elections
originally set for September, in which the opposition had hoped to make
further gains after major successes in 2019 district council voting,
have been postponed by 12 months. Although COVID-19 was the official
justification, the relatively low infection and death rates in the
territory, the June imposition of a draconian national security law, and
the August banning of 12 prodemocracy candidates from running next year
are among the many signs that have led experts to accuse the Chinese
Communist Party of using the delay to complete its suffocation of Hong
Kong's freedom and autonomy.

Among the countries that held elections, two encouraging cases stand
out. South Korean citizens voted for their National Assembly in April
with high confidence in their government's response to the pandemic.
Protective measures were implemented at polling places and specific
arrangements were made to avoid disenfranchising voters who were sick or
quarantined. The ruling party was rewarded with a resounding victory
amid the highest turnout in 28 years. In May, New Zealand officials
announced a range of measures to help ensure that its September
parliamentary elections could go forward, including more early voting,
personal protective equipment for polling places, and various forms of
remote voting. Although the elections were subsequently pushed to
October, the government will remain within its mandate under the plan,
and maintains high public trust.

South Korea and New Zealand are both rich, small, established
democracies. Nevertheless, they prove that successful elections can go
forward during a pandemic with proper planning and resources. COVID-19
cannot be considered a short-term disruption, and democracy cannot be
deferred indefinitely. A case to watch is Georgia's parliamentary
elections, set for October, which survey respondents flagged as a
possible positive example of international engagement in support of
necessary electoral preparations.

COVID-19 has thrived amid the misinformation and scapegoating of
democratically elected populists in countries like India and Brazil. It
has also deepened the fractures in the democratic institutions of the
United States. Not only have US death tolls been among the highest in
the world, but the pandemic hit in a crucial election year, and public
health has become politicized.

The Trump administration has been sharply criticized for creating a fog
of misinformation around the pandemic. In his press conferences and
social media posts, the president repeatedly downplayed the severity of
the coronavirus, attacked state governors from the opposition Democratic
Party for imposing social-distancing measures, promoted unproven
treatments and false health statistics, asserted that the pathogen would
soon disappear, and pushed for restrictions to be lifted even as the
contagion spread, among other harmful statements. The Department of
Health and Human Services ordered hospitals to redirect their COVID-19
data from an established reporting system at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention to a new database controlled by the department,
leading to concerns that the information could be manipulated or
obfuscated for political reasons. Senior public health professionals who
openly contradicted the president's claims were marginalized, while
others struggled to bridge the gap between the science and the
administration's political and economic priorities.

Many of the state-by-state primary elections leading up to the general
elections in November were held after the first coronavirus cases were
detected in February and March. Attempts to postpone the April voting in
Wisconsin led to a mixed series of lower court decisions that culminated
in a US Supreme Court ruling the night before election day. In the
resulting confusion, thousands of voters who had requested absentee
ballots never received them, and wait times for in-person voting
reportedly reached up to four hours due to reductions in the number of
polling places. Conditions were little better in June, when shortages of
poll workers, voting-machine problems, and dysfunction surrounding
absentee ballots wreaked havoc in the state of Georgia. Many experts
have expressed doubt that local election authorities across the country
are prepared for the November elections, citing increased demand for
voting by mail, likely staffing shortfalls, and last-minute changes to
electoral rules---all related to the pandemic.

In addition to its political reverberations, COVID-19 has underscored
the country's racial inequities, which put Black and Latino populations
at a particular disadvantage. Households in these communities are more
likely to have members who continued traveling to their workplaces
during local lockdown periods because their jobs could not be done
remotely, meaning they faced a greater risk of exposure to the virus.
Members of these groups were also more likely to have preexisting health
conditions---many of which can be linked to systemic bias in housing,
health care, employment, and education---that exacerbated the severity
of the disease among those who contracted it.

Separately, between March and July, US authorities used an emergency
health directive to summarily expel more than 40,000 people who were
apprehended for allegedly making unauthorized border crossings,
including unaccompanied minors and those who sought to apply for asylum
as permitted by US and international law. The policy raised concerns
that the Trump administration was exploiting the pandemic as a pretext
to set aside due process obligations and intensify its clampdown on
asylum seekers and immigration in general.

Individual democracy and human rights activists and journalists, who
were already under tremendous pressure from undemocratic governments,
have faced severe constraints during the coronavirus outbreak. In survey
responses, restrictions on movement in particular were cited for
creating obstacles to holding workshops, meeting with sources, providing
support to vulnerable populations, and conducting advocacy work. A
respondent on Poland explained, "As a journalist, my ability to contact
information sources has been limited---most such contacts have to be
made electronically...which significantly reduces the confidence of
information sources and limits the amount of information I receive." A
respondent on Ghana said, "The quarantine and ban on social
gatherings...made it difficult for us to reach the vulnerable during the
lockdown, particularly women who suffered from gender-based violence."

Technological alternatives have been useful for some organizations, for
instance by allowing them to engage with more stakeholders, but others
lament poor internet connectivity and a diminished ability to accomplish
their aims. In Morocco, "project activities linked to human rights
\[were\] either postponed or replaced by online activities which had
less impact at the level of interaction and engagement." In Turkey, an
"inability to conduct physical meetings has affected advocacy and
outreach work (especially when communities are unable to utilise
technology for various reasons)." In contrast, a respondent speaking
about activist work in Honduras said that "there is a larger audience
that has the time to learn and mobilize as well as show dissent."
Additional work has also arisen as more people need assistance and new
government abuses related to the pandemic require monitoring, straining
civil society's capacity.

Funding has become more difficult to obtain, and focus has
shifted---among governments, donors, and other stakeholders---from
democracy and human rights issues to more basic material needs. As a
Philippines respondent said, "The coronavirus outbreak has forced us to
adjust our operations," adding that "the pandemic has also made it more
difficult for us to reach the most vulnerable communities due to health
and security risks. To adapt, we have mainly moved our legal services
online and focused our attention to the urgent needs of Filipinos
brought about by the crisis."

Some experts reported fear of criticizing government policies around the
pandemic in part due to crackdowns on the media, activists, and other
critics; people were also wary of meeting with these actors. A
respondent on Cambodia said, "We are not freely conduct\[ing\] our
project activities...the government just uses \[the\] coronavirus
outbreak as \[an\] excuse to crack down and criminalize us."

Attention to urgent public health needs is crucial, but any successes
will not be sustainable without support for human rights and strong
democratic institutions, including an active and independent civil
society.

Activists, journalists, and citizens are working aggressively to
overcome the obstacles they face. They are organizing to push back
against government abuses in new ways, often utilizing online platforms
to engage with expanded audiences and form new partnerships. For
example, in Nigeria a respondent reported, "We have adopted the use of
social media and USSD codes, which enables the use of simple or
non-smart phones to conduct surveys instead of visiting communities to
conduct physical surveys." One organization in the Philippines has
developed a "human rights chatbot," with a respondent explaining that,
"our online legal assistance and information campaign has garnered
positive feedback from clients."

Journalism has received a boost in some locations as people seek out
information related to the health situation. Many survey respondents
described journalists risking their own freedom and safety in order to
report on the coronavirus and subsequent government abuses. In the
Philippines, where independent media is under assault by the Duterte
government, "journalists covering the pandemic are pushing back through
their enterprising methods of reporting despite the limitation in
movement. They are also more indignant whenever restrictions are applied
to the press, such as in the case of \[the\] ABS-CBN shutdown, wherein
hundreds of journalists stood in support of the news network."

Courts and legislators are also providing checks on excessive power and
abuses in certain countries. Brazil's Supreme Court, for instance, has
restrained President Jair Bolsonaro's antidemocratic tendencies: as
Indigenous communities were struck particularly hard by the virus, and
Bolsonaro vetoed part of a bill that would have provided them with
assistance, the court ruled that the government must enact health
measures in response. It also suspended a provisional measure that would
have limited freedom of information requests. In Lesotho, a respondent
reported, "the judiciary also ruled against the former prime minister's
decision to shut down Parliament using COVID-19 as the reason." A
respondent on Israel reported being inspired by "specific parliament
members who stood for themselves against their own political parties."

Despite quarantines, curfews, and lockdowns, many people are still
taking to the streets to challenge their governments, revealing that the
global pattern of mass protests that emerged in 2019 has continued.
Although 158 countries have had new restrictions placed on protests,
Freedom House researchers identified significant protests in at least 90
countries since the outbreak began. These demonstrations were held in
39 percent of Free countries, 60 percent of Partly Free countries, and
43 percent of Not Free countries under review. At least one third of the
countries in each region experienced a significant protest, up to two
thirds seeing protests in some regions. The sheer number of
demonstrations across all types of regimes and in every region of the
world demonstrates that even as governments look to take advantage of
the crisis to strengthen their own positions, people will continue to
challenge them.

Events in Belarus represent a powerful example of pushback in a country
where freedom of assembly has long been severely restricted.
Unprecedented mass protests against President Alyaksandr Lukashenka, who
has led the country since 1994, erupted in August following his claim of
victory in a vote marred by repression of opposition figures and
allegations of widespread fraud. Resistance against Lukashenka was
sparked at least in part by his denial of the pandemic, which
contributed to a deadly outbreak of the virus. Thousands of protesters
have been detained, and many have been subjected to extensive brutality
by security forces, including torture. With Russian president Vladimir
Putin threatening to intervene on Lukashenka's behalf, it is vital that
the international community support the protesters' demands for
government accountability and democratic change.

Yet [for every noteworthy attempt to hold bad actors
accountable]{.underline} and to respect political rights and civil
liberties, [there are numerous other measures that have chipped away at
democratic norms and freedoms]{.underline}. Especially in struggling
democracies and amid more recent reformers, [freedom is fragile and
requires constant cultivation.]{.underline} Proponents of democracy must
support one another around the world to ensure that government failures
lead to renewed demands for stronger institutions. Otherwise the deadly
COVID-19 pandemic will result in lasting damage to global freedom.

**[2ac -- AT: CCP Collapse !]{.underline}**

**No CCP collapse -- resilience, meritocracy, and legitimacy check.**

**Li 13** Eric X. Li is a Henry Crown Fellow at the Aspen Institute. He
is also a venture capitalist in Shanghai who serves on the board of
directors of China Europe International Business School (CEIBS) and is
vice chairman of its publishing arm CEIBS Publishing Group. "The Life of
the Party," Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb, 92.1, EBSCO

In November 2012, [the]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party
([CCP]{.underline}) held its 18th National Congress, setting in motion a
once-in-a-decade [transfer of power]{.underline} to a new generation of
leaders. As expected, Xi Jinping took over as general secretary and will
become the president of the People\'s Republic this March. The turnover
[was]{.underline} a [smooth and well-orchestrated]{.underline}
demonstration by a confidently rising superpower. [That didn\'t
stop]{.underline} international [media]{.underline} and even some
Chinese intellectuals, however, [from portraying it as a moment of
crisis.]{.underline} In an issue that was published before the beginning
of the congress, for example, The Economist quoted unnamed scholars at a
recent conference as saying that China is \"unstable at the grass roots,
dejected at the middle strata and out of control at the top.\" To be
sure, months before the handover, the scandal surrounding Bo Xilai, the
former party boss of the Chongqing municipality, had shattered the
CCP\'S long-held facade of unity, which had underwritten domestic
political stability since the Tiananmen Square upheavals in 1989. To
make matters worse, the Chinese economy, which had sustained
double-digit GDP growth for two decades, slowed, decelerating for seven
straight quarters. China\'s economic model of rapid industrialization,
labor-intensive manufacturing, large-scale government investments in
infrastructure, and export growth seemed to have nearly run its course.
[Some]{.underline} in China and the West [have gone so far as to predict
the demise of the one-party state]{.underline}, which they allege cannot
survive if leading politicians stop delivering economic miracles.¶ [Such
pessimism]{.underline}, however, [is misplaced.]{.underline} There is no
doubt that daunting [challenges await Xi.]{.underline} [But [those who
suggest]{.mark} that [the CCP will not be able to deal]{.mark} with them
[**fundamentally misread** China\'s politics and the]{.mark} [resilience
of its governing institutions.]{.mark} [Beijing will]{.mark} be able to
[meet the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[country\'s ills
with]{.underline}]{.mark} dynamism and [[**resilience**, thanks to the
**CCP\'S adaptability**, system of **meritocracy**, and
**legitimacy**]{.mark} with the Chinese people. In the next
decade]{.underline}, China will continue to rise, not fade. [The
country\'s leaders will consolidate the one-party model
and]{.underline}, in the process, [challenge the West\'s conventional
wisdom about]{.underline} political development and the [inevitable
march toward electoral democracy.]{.underline} In the capital of the
Middle Kingdom, the world might witness the birth of a post-democratic
future.¶ ON-THE-JOB LEARNING¶ [The [**assertion** that one-party rule
is]{.mark} inherently [incapable of self-correction does not
reflect]{.mark} the [**historical record**.]{.mark} During its 63 years
in power, [the CCP has shown **extraordinary
adaptability.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Since its founding in 1949, the
People\'s Republic has pursued a broad range of economic policies.
First, the CCP initiated radical land collectivization in the early
1950s. This was followed by the policies of the Great Leap Forward in
the late 1950s and the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s to
mid-1970s. After them came the quasi-privatization of farmland in the
early 1960s, Deng Xiaoping\'s market reforms in the late 1970s, and
Jiang Zemin\'s opening up of the CCP\'S membership to private
businesspeople in the 1990s. [The underlying goal has always been
economic health, and [when a policy did not work]{.mark}]{.underline}
\-- for example, the disastrous Great Leap Forward and Cultural
Revolution \-- **[[China was able to find something that
did]{.underline}]{.mark}**: for example, Deng\'s reforms, which
catapulted the Chinese economy into the position of second largest in
the world.¶ [On the institutional front as well, the CCP has not shied
away from reform. [One example]{.mark} is the
[introduction]{.mark}]{.underline} in the 1980s and 1990s [[of term
limits]{.underline}]{.mark} for most political positions (and even of
age limits, of 68-70, for the party\'s most senior leadership). Before
this, political leaders had been able to use their positions to
accumulate power and perpetuate their rules. Mao Zedong was a case in
point. He had ended the civil wars that had plagued China and repelled
foreign invasions to become the father of modern China. Yet his
prolonged rule led to disastrous mistakes, such as the Cultural
Revolution. Now, it is nearly impossible for the few at the top to
consolidate long-term power. Upward mobility within the party has also
increased.¶ In terms of foreign policy, China has also changed course
many times to achieve national greatness. It moved from a close alliance
with Moscow in the 1950s to a virtual alliance with the United States in
the 1970s and 1980s as it sought to contain the Soviet Union. Today, its
pursuit of a more independent foreign policy has once more put it at
odds with the United States. But in its ongoing quest for greatness,
China is seeking to defy recent historical precedents and rise
peacefully, avoiding the militarism that plagued Germany and Japan in
the first half of the last century.¶ As China undergoes its ten-year
transition, calls at home and abroad for another round of political
reform have increased. One radical camp in China and abroad is urging
the party to allow multiparty elections or at least accept formal
intraparty factions. In this view, only full-scale adversarial politics
can ensure that China gets the leadership it needs. However sincere,
these demands all miss a basic fact: [the CCP has]{.underline} arguably
[been one of the most self-reforming political organizations in recent
world history]{.underline}. There is no doubt that Chinas new leaders
face a different world than Hu Jintao did when he took over in 2002, but
chances are good that [Xi\'s [CCP will]{.mark} be able to [adapt
to]{.mark} and [meet whatever new challenges]{.mark} the rapidly
[changing]{.mark} [domestic]{.mark}]{.underline} and international
[[environments pose]{.underline}]{.mark}. In part, [that is because the
CCP is heavily meritocratic and promotes those with proven experience
and capabilities.]{.underline}

**Collapse is [impossible]{.underline} -- no credible alternatives.**

The party's advantages are less often discussed, but these bear
reviewing if one is to evaluate the viability of CCP rule. [One of the
most overlooked, but important, assets is a **[lack of any]{.mark}
credible [alternative]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The party's repressive
politics prevent the formation of potential candidates, so the
alternative to CCP rule for now is anarchy]{.underline}. [[For a country
**still traumatized** by its]{.mark} historic experience with national
[breakdown]{.mark}, this [grants]{.mark} the party **[no small
advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [To truly imperil its authority, [the
CCP would need to behave in so damaging a manner as to make the
**certainty** of]{.mark} political [**chaos** and **economic collapse**
**preferable**]{.mark} to the continuation of CCP rule]{.underline}. A
party that attempted to return to extreme Mao-era policies such as the
catastrophic Great Leap Forward could perhaps meet that threshold. But
despite the numerous superficial comparisons in Western media, little
about the current administration policy agenda resembles classic Maoism.

[The second major political advantage lies in improvements to the
party's effectiveness]{.underline} in recent years. In a major paradigm
shift, [[the CCP]{.underline}]{.mark} redefined itself as a "governing
party" whose primary responsibility rests in addressing the myriad
economic, political, cultural, ecological, and social welfare demands of
the people. It [has carried out **[ideological and political
reforms]{.mark}** to improve its competence and effectiveness
accordingly]{.underline}. [The Xi]{.underline} administration
[has]{.underline} refined, but [upheld]{.underline}, the focus on
increasing [the nation's standard of living]{.underline} and [realizing
national revitalization]{.underline}, objectives [embodied in
the]{.underline} vision of the ["Chinese dream."]{.underline} Although
the party has rightly come in for criticism for moving slowly and
inadequately on these issues, [the]{.underline} policy
[[agenda]{.underline}]{.mark} nevertheless [[appears to
**resonate**]{.mark} with the majority of Chinese citizens]{.underline}.
[[**Independent polls** **consistently** show]{.mark} that the party
has]{.underline} in recent years [enjoyed surprisingly [**strong**
public support]{.mark}]{.underline}.

When weighing the party's political liabilities against its assets,
therefore, [the evidence suggests that [the CCP faces **little danger**
of]{.mark} imminent **[collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Improvements
to its **cohesion**, **competence**, and **responsiveness**]{.mark},
combined with a [policy]{.mark} agenda [that resonates]{.mark} with most
Chinese [and the lack of a compelling alternative **outweigh**]{.mark}
the persistent political [liabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The party's
overall political [stability **throughout the 2000s**, **despite
massive**]{.mark} **political [unrest]{.mark}** generated by breakneck
economic growth, [**underscores** this]{.mark} point]{.underline}.

"[[Refolution]{.underline}]{.mark}" [is a combination of reform and
revolution]{.underline}. Typically, [this process [starts with limited
reform]{.mark}]{.underline} initiated by the old regime, [[but ends
with]{.mark} its [involuntary exit]{.mark} from power.]{.underline} This
phenomenon was first observed by Alexis de Tocqueville, who famously
observed that "the most perilous moment for a bad government is one when
it seeks to mend its ways."22 This Tocquevillean paradox was vividly
illustrated when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's mid-1980s program of
limited political reform, known as perestroika, sparked nationalist
independence movements and ultimately a democratic revolution in the
Soviet empire. Based on the instances of regime transition since the
mid-1970s, "refolution" (or "transplacement," to use Huntington's term)
can be divided into two categories. The first consists of those
transitions that begin with reform and end with the removal of the
ruling elites through "founding elections"---peaceful and competitive
votes that are negotiated between the old-regime elite and the
opposition. The second variant also starts with [limited
regime-initiated reform]{.underline}, but it [ends with the collapse of
the old regime]{.underline} rather than its negotiated exit via
elections. The final phase of this type of "refolution" resembles a
classic revolution, but with one critical difference: [The [demise of
the old regime comes with]{.mark} **relatively [little
bloodshed]{.mark}**]{.underline}; rather than suffering defeat at the
hands of an armed opposition, [[the regime]{.mark} essentially
**[disintegrates]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[its authority
**evaporates**]{.underline}, [and its key supporters
defect]{.underline}. By Huntington's count, between 1974 and 1990 eleven
transitions qualified as "transplacement."23 To this list we may now add
Burma. Although the country is not yet a full democracy, the democrats
are now in charge of the government after the military regime's
humiliating and decisive loss in Burma's first competitive elections,
held in 2015. \[End Page 15\] The most critical variable in a
"refolution" scenario is the shifting balance of power between the old
regime and the opposition.24 This insight is crucial when considering
the possible transition scenarios in regimes with conditions that are
inhospitable to revolution, such as totalitarian or posttotalitarian
regimes. For example, mass uprisings have no chance of success in
regimes with strong repressive capacity. If, however, a regime becomes
significantly weaker during the initial phase of the transition process,
there may be some possibility that it could be overthrown at a later
stage. The weakening of an old regime typically begins with the decay of
its key institutions and the deterioration of its performance. This
process can lead to two outcomes: A near-certain outcome is increasing
opposition to the old regime and the erosion of its popular support. A
less certain outcome is the rise of reformers inside the regime. The
deterioration of the old regime could undermine the hard-liners and help
reformers to emerge and take control of the top positions. These
reformers could then undertake limited changes in the hope of reversing
the regime's deterioration. This would loosen up the old system and
create initial opportunities for mass political mobilization. Of course,
if the hard-liners manage to hold on to power in spite of the worsening
conditions, reform would not occur and decay would continue. If,
however, moderate reformers succeed in gaining power and launching
limited reforms, three subsequent developments are certain to occur.
First, [[the old regime]{.mark} will **[suffer a]{.mark}**]{.underline}
further [**[split]{.underline}** [into]{.underline}]{.mark} three
groups: [[moderate]{.mark} reformers in power,]{.underline} hard-liners
opposed to even limited changes, [[and radical reformers]{.mark}
demanding fundamental changes. [This]{.mark}]{.underline} three-way
[rift will]{.underline} often [produce a
**[stalemate]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[that [creates]{.mark}
highly favorable [conditions for]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[removal of
the old regime]{.underline}]{.mark} (primarily because **[[it paralyzes
the old regime's repressive apparatus]{.underline}]{.mark}**). Second,
[[even in a stalemated]{.mark} reform [process societal forces
will]{.mark} gain unprecedented freedom and lose their fear of
repression. This window of opportunity allows them to [mobilize and
acquire new capacities]{.mark}]{.underline}, thus **[[shifting]{.mark}
the [balance of power in their favor]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Third, the
erosion of the old regime's legitimacy will continue at an accelerating
pace. Posttotalitarian regimes that attempt to reform must bear the
heavy burden of history---specifically, the responsibility for crimes
committed by their totalitarian predecessors against their own people.
Limited \[End Page 16\] reform invariably brings greater press freedom,
which in turn exposes the old regime's crimes, laying bear the "Big Lie"
that had shored up the regime's legitimacy. A thoroughly delegitimized
old regime is highly vulnerable to revolutionary overthrow. In essence,
this describes the "refolution" dynamics that led to the collapse of the
USSR. [[In the Chinese case, the likelihood of "refolution" will
increase]{.underline}]{.mark} in the next ten years. By then, China will
have experienced roughly an additional decade of regime decay. The
effects of long-term economic stagnation, social frustrations, and
deteriorating performance will have become plainly visible. If Xi steps
down at the end of his second term, his successor will be under immense
pressure to reverse the CCP's declining fortunes. Such speculation, of
course, assumes the likely failure of Xi's efforts to revive the CCP
through a mix of internal discipline, heightened repression, appeals to
nationalism, and partial economic reforms. Moreover, by the dawn of the
next decade, the CCP's two post--Mao-era survival
strategies---neoauthoritarian crony capitalism and strongman rule---will
have proved to be unviable. Xi's successor will therefore have to find
another way to regain legitimacy. [It will be a supreme irony of history
if the CCP is ultimately brought down by refolution]{.underline}. Since
Tiananmen, no nightmare has obsessed the CCP leadership more than the
collapse of the Soviet Union, and no political leader has been more
reviled by the party than Gorbachev. It is possible that the CCP's
determination not to succumb to the same fate as the Soviet Union will
prevent the emergence of a Gorbachev-like figure, however dire the
circumstances. But again, [**[authoritarian regimes adopt
reform]{.mark}** mostly **[out of despair]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Truly
[**[desperate dictatorships]{.underline}**]{.mark} may **[[have few
other options]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This dynamic compelled Mao's
immediate successors to embrace capitalism in the late 1970s, and we
should not rule out the possibility that the same logic will force
future Chinese leaders to take another historic gamble.

But [even if Taiwan was forcibly stripped of its]{.underline}
surface-to-air missiles ([SAMs]{.underline}) , [and China could command
the skies at low cost]{.underline}, in a wider context [China faces a
dilemma, a tradeoff between surprise and preparation]{.underline}.
Whether it struck in 2009 14 or 2019, [surprise and
deception]{.underline} would [come at the expense of preparedness and
speed of engagement]{.underline} with large-scale forces, and vice
versa. To inflict a surprise first strike that successfully suppressed
Taiwan\'s air defences to the extent that it achieved air dominance,
China would need to do so from a standing start, and [to avoid giving
the game away would]{.underline} have to [forgo]{.underline} the prior
[preparation of a large-scale invasion force]{.underline} into a
cross-strait armada, to cross the 100 nautical miles (run) from its
bases closest to the most plausible point of assault, the small number
of locations on the north-west beaches of Taiwan. [It could hardly amass
this force invisibly if a watchful Taiwan was **minimally alert** and
used]{.underline} its [surveillance]{.underline} technology
[efficiently]{.underline}. [The [interval between]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [first [strike and]{.mark}]{.underline} then [[preparation]{.mark}
for]{.underline} the attempted [invasion]{.underline} would [[afford a
vital window]{.underline}]{.mark} of time [[for Taiwan to
**recover**]{.underline} [and **prepare**]{.underline}]{.mark} [for the
next phase]{.underline}, including the roughly seven hours it would take
for a fleet travelling at 15 knots to make the one-way crossing.
Conversely, to prepare adequately with a buildup of force would
sacrifice surprise, [giving Taiwan **days**]{.underline} at least [[to
**disperse**]{.mark} its [forces]{.mark}, **[ensure]{.mark} the
[survival]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of large parts of its air force and
get its planes off the airfields]{.underline}. [[Taiwan\'s
**topography**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[is]{.mark} such [that]{.mark}
there are [only a few landing]{.mark}-friendly [points]{.mark} along
its]{.underline} 500-mile [coastline]{.underline} where a massed
invasion could take place and [where]{.underline} the [defender could
concentrate]{.underline} its [forces]{.underline}. Consider the contrast
with the Allied invasion of Normandy, where an amphibious assault could
have taken place along a coastline 1,200 miles long and without the
surveillance assets of today. Since [the invasion fleet would have to
be]{.underline} a [sizable]{.underline} one of 100 assault ships loading
vehicles, troops and supplies, and since [a fully loaded]{.underline}
invasion [fleet would take]{.underline} about [seven hours]{.underline}
going at 15 knots in a one-way crossing of 100 nautical miles at the
closest point, [[it is **inconceivable**]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[Taiwan would not see the buildup]{.mark} or see them
coming]{.underline}.

Given China\'s greater strength of numbers and firepower and the problem
that Taiwan would simply be unable to out-match it in crude material
terms, a vital part of Taiwan\'s defence is the degree to which it has
chosen prudent \'doctrine\', and how realistically it defines victory.
Doctrine simply means ideas of force employment. It scarcely determines
outcomes, and relies on execution, but is needed to link technological
means with strategic ends. [Taiwan may not be able to out-gun
China]{.underline} materially, [but]{.underline} as
**[[history]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[suggests]{.underline}]{.mark},
[well-prepared [weaker]{.mark} defending [sides can return fire]{.mark}
by **[optimising]{.mark}**]{.underline} [what they have [to create an
**imposing defensive system**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Taiwanese and
international observers have intensively debated what it should do with
its lesser resources in the face of an adversary whose relative material
strength is growing alarmingly. Several competing doctrinal options have
been on the table. None of these are mutually exclusive but there are
tradeoffs involved, as each would draw resources from the others. They
can be organised around two ideal-typical \'poles\', \'classical
defence\' and \'porcupine defence\'.

The \'classical defence\' grows out of Taiwan\'s traditional doctrine of
defence against an invader. When it had the greater qualitative military
edge, Taiwan defined victory in offensive terms, to win in a direct
clash for control of the seas and skies, overpowering China\'s larger
but less advanced forces. It also planned on interdicting China\'s
approaching forces far from Taiwan\'s coast. Designed for a symmetrical,
toeto-toe clash, this approach was capital-intense and involved hi-tech
conventional forces at the cutting edge. It sought to thwart Chinese
invading forces out at sea and in air space well beyond its islands,
which would also be defended by a mass citizen army. Budgetary
constraints, China\'s military modernisation fuelled by economic growth,
disenchantment with conscription and a shift to an all-volunteer army
have made this approach problematic. Today the model is reinventeq in
the argument that Taiwan should compete with China\'s modernisation
programme with its own, lobbying hard for state-of-the-art aircraft such
as the F 16 CID or the Joint Strike Fighter, as well as developing the
ability to engage in a conflict via bombing the Chinese mainland with
surface-to-surface missiles with extended range, which would also form a
pre-emptive strike capability. In a struggle that would entail a clash
of advanced machines, Taiwan would not give up its effort to compete in
the same technological contest and match its quality with China\'s.

By contrast, [the **[\'porcupine defence\']{.mark}**
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} more deliberately
**[[asymmetrical]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the sense that it seeks to
[exploit]{.underline} the [differences between invader and
defender]{.underline} - differences of strategic objective as well as
differences in the type of forces being used (Murray 2008). Instead of
an expensive modernisation programme that attempts to match the quality
if not the quantity of China\'s forces, it looks more to a \'passive
defence\' [that]{.underline} would [ensure]{.underline} that [enough of
Taiwan\'s forces]{.underline} could [survive the initial
onslaught]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} porcupine [approach
invests]{.underline} more [in]{.underline} the
[survivability]{.underline} of forces, their [dispersal and
concealment]{.underline}, the [hardening]{.underline} of
**[c]{.underline}**ommand [and]{.underline} **[c]{.underline}**ontrol
systems, the [repair]{.underline} of [damaged assets]{.underline} such
as runways, and [resilience against electromagnetic and
cyber]{.underline} attacks. It is a more army-centric doctrine that
places more investment in [fortifying ground-based infrastructure and
training]{.underline} personnel for a land war. It emphasises the
exploitation of terrain. It is [**less reliant on American largesse**
and tech]{.underline}nology [transfer]{.underline}. In an alternative
version, a low-tech porcupine strategy could also extend out to sea,
with guerrilla warfare in nearby waters waged by \'swarms of light
combatants\' (Holmes 2013a).

What we know of Taiwan\'s actual strategy mixes features from both
models. The evidence that we have suggests that [[Taiwan is making
**prudent choices**]{.underline}]{.mark} about how it allocates its
resources and is redefining its objectives realistically. It draws from
the porcupine logic the shift from ambitious to achievable strategic
goals. Rather than seeking to defeat Chinese forces outright in a
decisive Mahanian naval clash, its objective is [[to **deny
China**]{.underline}]{.mark} an [affordable conquest]{.underline} by
**[[raising costs]{.underline}]{.mark}** on invader [to defend defacto
independence]{.underline}. When it had the greater qualitative military
edge, Taiwan defined victory in offensive terms - to win in a direct
clash for control of seas and skies, overpowering and destroying
China\'s larger but less advanced forces. It designed its defences
accordingly, around capital ships and advanced planes and matching its
adversaries\' investments. Judging by its own published doctrine, the
National Defense Report of 2011, Taiwan recognises that victory in these
terms is no longer realistic and it is switching accordingly (Cole
2013a). Taiwan now defines victory as ensuring the survival of enough
forces and preventing land forces establishing a foothold on Taiwan
(Republic of China 2011: 131-132).4 Its Quadrennial Defense Review of
2013 also suggests a doctrinal shift, emphasising the preservation of
critical infrastructure to prevent being paralysed by \'sudden and
high-intensity assaults\' and the exploitation of Taiwan\'s advantages
in space and time (Republic of China 2013: 38-40, 41). The same logic
that enables China with today\'s tools to raise the costs of US
intervention into its maritime space to unpalatable levels enables
Taiwan to do the same at a price more suited to its limited GDP
expenditure on defence (Blumenthal 2011; Holmes 2013b). To turn the
nautical approaches to the island into contested zones, [[it exploits
**\'swarming\' methods**]{.underline}]{.mark} [by preparing small-attack
craft armed with anti-ship cruise missiles as **light guerrillas at
sea**]{.underline}.

There is evidence that [Taiwan is putting]{.underline} these [doctrinal
decisions into practice]{.underline} (Minnick 2010; Cole 2012a; Cole
2013b; Cole 2013c; United States-Taiwan Business Council 2010).
[Taiwan]{.underline} has [built [a **hidden underground
sanctuary**]{.mark}]{.underline} [inside a mountain]{.underline} near
its Hualien air base on its east coast, [a bomb shelter large enough to
shelter 200 fighters]{.underline} linked to the above-ground base by a
7,500 foot taxiway. At least since 2010[, it has been [**hardening**
airfield]{.mark} facilities]{.underline}, has introduced a major
hardened aircraft storage facility at Taitung in south-eastern Taiwan,
and is now addressing one of the weaknesses identified by RAND in 2009
by strengthening its Rapid Runway Repair crews [to improve]{.underline}
the [survivability of runways]{.underline} at several air bases. [It
invests in [**mobile** launchers]{.mark} for missiles]{.underline} and
has acquired and now fields roadmobile missile launchers [that can be
**[dispersed]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and
**camouflaged**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [armed with rockets [capable of
firing]{.mark} at ships]{.underline} (such as the HF-3 supersonic
anti-ship cruise missile) and Ray Ting 2000s [with]{.underline} an
[artillery range]{.underline} of up to 45 km [[into]{.mark} China\'s
[mainland]{.mark}]{.underline}. To turn the point of amphibious landing
into a shooting gallery, it is digging in with entrenched anti-ship and
anti-air missile sites. To make both the sea approach and the beachhead
more perilous, [it prepares **[sea and land
mines]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the former of which could be [scattered by
artillery tubes]{.underline}. And it prepares to wage a \'war of the
flea\' out at sea with small, fast and low-signature missile-armed ships
(31 Kuang Hua VI class boats) that are [harder to locate and
sink]{.underline} than heavier frigates and destroyers. They would be
[assisted by]{.underline} 12 maritime [patrol aircraft]{.underline}.
These lighter ships are [armed with cruise and surface-to-surface
missiles]{.underline}, thereby [mixing]{.underline} the [asymmetric
logic of the porcupine strategy with]{.underline} the [active extended
defence]{.underline} desired by the classical approach. There is some
uncertainty about how effectively these could operate in a full-scale
war scenario, given their reliance on off-board radar and datalinks for
targeting, which are located on vulnerable radar sites within range of
China\'s missiles. Regardless, Taiwan has also diversified and expanded
its number of smaller ships, increasing the number of its coastal patrol
craft from 51 to 61 - a 20% increase as of 2012 (Cordesman, Hess, and
Yarosh 2012: 198) - and armed seven patrol boats and . a radar-evasive
fast attack corvette with Hsiung Feng III (HF-3) ramjet-powered
supersonic anti-ship missiles to increase the probability of having a
surviving naval defence off its coastline. This prudently trades off
Taiwan\'s ability to fight a high-seas naval battle for the ability to
mount a defence closer to its littoral. Taipei has also developed the
ability to push the defence line further out from its coast through the
alternative means of long-range missiles that enable the interdiction of
enemy forces out at sea. If the \'swarming\' orchestration of smaller
assets against larger forces is potentially a potent way for weaker
states like Taiwan to threaten surface fleets with their large,
expensively acquired capital ships, on the evidence we have, a prima
facie overview suggests that [Taiwan has developed both the doctrine and
the tools to carry it off]{.underline} (Holmes and Yoshihara 2012).
Since RAND produced its estimate in 2009, [Taiwan\'s increasing
investment]{.underline} in and attention to building a passive defence
by [increasing]{.underline} the [probability that its capabilities will
be **dispersed**]{.underline}, **[concealed]{.underline}** [and
**survivable**]{.underline} is possibly the most significant development
in Taiwan\'s preparation [to [counter the]{.mark} growing [\'missile\'
imbalance]{.mark} across the straits]{.underline}.

Even though there remains uncertainty about the success of any of these
measures in a conflict, [[each]{.underline}]{.mark} of them [[adds a
**\'layer\' of defence**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that increases the
probability that China will not be able to clear the seas and skies
sufficiently to create a safe corridor for]{.underline} its [invading
forces to approach, and]{.underline} that [Taiwan can punch back and
inflict significant damage]{.underline} after the first barrage. Just as
importantly, [each extra layer of potential surviving
defence]{.underline} [**[adds uncertainty]{.underline}** [to **China\'s
calculations**]{.underline}]{.mark} [about]{.underline} the **[costs of
invasion]{.underline}**. 5 Through passive defensive measures,
[Taiwan]{.underline} would aim to [keep its forces survivable: through
mobility, redundancy, and]{.underline} the [hardening and camouflage
of]{.underline} its [assets]{.underline}, as well as the [stockpiling of
food and fuel]{.underline}. These would not prevent large-scale damage
to Taiwan\'s military and civilian property but could preserve enough
combat power to keep material costs on following-on invading force high.
This doctrine, properly applied, would help it raise costs on amphibious
force as it approached and as it reached the shore in the following
phases.

The \'bottom line\' in an amphibious campaign is the ability to
transport enough troops to the point of invasion, and securely enough to
land and supply them. Let us assume that China now possesses the 100
transport ships it aims to acquire. Going on a rough 1: 1 personnel
ratio, RAND estimated in 2009 that China would need to get at least two
group armies, or roughly 60,000 troops, ashore, and that this would
require 194 successful naval trips or sorties.6 [The difficulty for
[China]{.mark} is]{.underline} that unless its initial effort to
suppress Taiwan\'s defences and deflect its air and naval attacks
succeeds almost perfectly, [its [ability to get enough ships
across]{.mark} safely [will be in **jeopardy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Unless China could successfully neutralise Taiwan\'s ability to \'thin
the herd\']{.underline} by [taking out its air bases, its fixed and
mobile]{.underline} land-based [missile launchers]{.underline} (such as
RBS-17 coastal-defence missiles mounted on trucks), [its missile-armed
Apache helicopters and its swarming fast-attack ships, **[its invasion
will be in trouble]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

To take one layer of defence alone: RAND estimates that ifTaiwan\'s 31
Kuang Hua VI class fast missile boats, armed with four Hsiung Feng II
ASCMs each, launch half of their payload, that would put 60 in the air,
enough to inflict a disabling \'mission kill\' on perhaps 12 Chinese
transport ships. Going on RAND\'s estimate that, distributed evenly,
each ship represents 310 troops and six vehicles, 12 ships sunk or
turned back would see off 3,700 troops and 72 vehicles, and prevent
those ships from participating in the three extra sorties needed for the
entire transport fleet to get 60,000 troops and their equipment across
within a reasonable span of five days. If China would want each ship to
attempt four sorties, 12 ships taken out of action before completing
their first sortie would mean a total of 48 sorties denied of the 194
out of 400 needed to succeed.

In this first phase, the weight of forces would favour China, but [the
conditions of [space and time]{.mark}]{.underline} would **[[favour
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**. On the more optimistic end of the
spectrum, [Taiwan\'s [early-warning]{.mark} system [would
succeed]{.mark}, giving it vital minutes [to protect]{.mark} its forces
[from]{.mark} incoming [strikes]{.mark} and preserving enough planes to
contest the skies]{.underline}. But taking a worse-case scenario would
also leave it with warning of another kind. The Chinese air force, with
saturation missile attacks and then fixed-wing attacks, lands a knockout
punch against Taiwan\'s air bases, following the failure of its
earlywarning system, Taiwan would be forced to use degraded air bases
with a degraded capacity to generate air sorties. But, to ensure
deception and surprise, [China would have to refrain from large-scale
preparatory buildup of amphibious forces]{.underline}. The air attack
plus the time it would take to build up invasion forces would place
Taiwan on notice to mobilise forces for defending ground. If Taiwan had
time and depending on levels of preparation, it could adopt a
\'layered\' forward defence, looking to \'thin the herd\' of China\'s
amphibious forces at sea before defending at the water\'s edge. It would
take aim primarily at its transport ships.

Let us suppose that despite the many problems the task would entail,
China has seized the ability to cross the distance of 100 nautical miles
from the bases closest to north-west Taiwan, neutralised Taiwan\'s sea
and air defences, and reached the coast bearing platforms to operate
from, such as several Type 071 Landing Platform Dock ships with hangers
and landing and vehicle decks, loaded with marines, vehicles and
helicopters, and over a dozen landing ships. The next task would be to
forcibly enter terrain in the face of reinforced defences while
vulnerable, establish a beachhead, and continuously supply a very large
military force across the ocean despite adversary actions.

[In a **[worst-case scenario]{.mark}** for [Taiwan]{.mark}, where China
successfully destroyed its air bases and runways, the defender
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [[still]{.underline}]{.mark} be
able to **[[mount a robust defence]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[that
inflicted **serious costs**]{.mark} by creating a **lethal
zone**]{.underline} at the point of \'run-in\' where the approaching
forces must operate in plain sight, unmasked by electronic sensors (see
Shlapak et al. 2009: 114-115). [Taiwan\'s coastline means]{.underline}
that [it could anticipate the]{.underline} approximate [point of
invasion]{.underline}. [[China\'s]{.mark} transport
[ships]{.mark}]{.underline} would [[enter a **kill
zone**]{.underline}]{.mark} in which [Taiwan would]{.underline} have
roughly a 20-minute window to [fire Hellfire missiles at
transports]{.underline}, or five minutes to fire at faster air-cushion
landing craft. Then [with]{.underline} a minimal [surviving]{.underline}
blend of [Apache helicopters]{.underline}, dug-in and mobile [artillery,
and missile forces and mines, Taiwan]{.underline} could be expected to
[turn the point of disembarkation **into a [shooting
gallery]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and a **chaotic traffic jam**, [even if
it lacked control of]{.mark} the [skies]{.mark}]{.underline} over the
beach [and even if its aircraft were pinned in shelters or
immobilised]{.underline} by destroyed runways. If it would take two
1,000 lb bombs, such as Joint Direct Attack Munitions, to destroy a
warship, 100 fired by a B-1B plane could disable 50 ships, or failing
that, helicopters, ground launchers, infantry and tanks could deliver
Hellfire missiles over a short range of five miles. In this respect,
RAND\'s estimate of 2009 still holds, only [Taiwan has taken greater
steps to ensure that its arsenal would survive]{.underline} the
preliminary bombardment.

This is not the place for a precise forecast that ignores the play of
chance and the effect of \'unknowns\', not least China\'s relative
ability to mount cyber attacks against Taiwan\'s increasing preparations
of cyber defence, an aspect of the conflict too secretive and
untraceable to measure precisely in advance. But on this analysis, the
scenario is more difficult for the invader than the attacker, to the
extent that the stars must align more or less perfectly for the
attacker. The defender, Taiwan, would merely have to ride out the first
bombardment well enough to be able to make an attempted invasion
expensive. As I argue, [a Chinese [invasion would be **costly**,
**protracted** and **geopolitically dangerous**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
There is no certain way to measure the political will of either side in
a neat cost-benefit calculs. Taiwan represents something bigger
politically than just an island with resources, to both its inhabitants
and the larger state that covets it, and the history of the issue is
drenched with emotion. We can estimate, however, what an attempted
conquest would entail and the kinds of costs and risks that the invader
would be wise to consider. The longer the struggle continued, the
greater would be the fear of it escalating and drawing in other powers.
Taiwan\'s objective would be to pose the question to China of just how
large a sacrifice it was prepared to make to achieve its objectives.
[Despite the eroding defence advantages and closing gap
between]{.underline} China and Taiwan\'s [forces, Taiwan could still
inflict **grave**]{.underline}, possibly **[prohibitive
costs]{.underline}** [on the invader]{.underline}. [[China\'s]{.mark}
increasing airpower \'edge\']{.underline} and strengthening cross-strait
strike [and invasion [capabilities would **not be
enough**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to negate the]{.mark} possibility of
exploiting geography to the **[defender\'s decisive
advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Taiwan\'s objective, within reach of
its capabilities, would not be to sink/destroy China\'s navy and air
force, but to make adventurism very expensive, to the point where
[successful [conquest would set China]{.mark}\'s military
[back]{.mark}]{.underline} years if not
**[[decades]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This confirms the recent warning of
RAND that \'forced entry\' via large-scale, over-the-shore amphibious
assault against resistance is obsolete for many environments (Davis and
Wilson 2011: 13-14). The same logic that enables China with today\'s
tools to raise the costs of US intervention into its maritime space to
unpalatable levels enables Taiwan to do the same at a price more suited
to its limited GDP expenditure on defence. For America, [these
developments]{.underline} both **[generate security]{.underline}** [and
constrain its power]{.underline} at the same time. As Christopher Layne
argues, \'Far from shrinking the world grand strategically, for the
United States, modern weaponry - naval and strategic airpower,
intercontinental delivery systems, and nuclear weapons - has widened
it\' (Layne 2006: 278).

3 No-one\'s world: negotiating power in an unconquerable Asia

If we really do inhabit a globalising world where distance loses its
force, that process should make conquest easier. This should be so to
the extent that the outcomes of conflicts are generated by the balance
of material forces, mediated far less by the effects of exploiting
terrain than they would have been historically. But as this chapter
argues, our era is different. Across bodies of water, it is one of fire
without conquest. New weapons with their range and lethality have the
capacity to increase distance and erect new barriers to interlopers.
Space, therefore, is better conceived as an interplay of political will,
capabilities and geography. As I have demonstrated here, the history of
the continual shifting balance between sword and shield, and the
tendency of states to measure the stakes involved according to the
\'nearness\' or \'farness\' of the war, casts doubt on strategic visions
where technology erases the dilemmas of distance or creates unambiguous
\'offence dominance\'. We are seeing the emergence of a period of access
denial. These issues are pressing in maritime East Asia, where the
strategic implications of new weapons shape the rivalries and mutual
fears of rising powers. An illustrative case where offensive technology
would meet the exploitation of time, space and terrain for defensive
purposes is the crossstrait military balance and the prospects for a
Chinese invasion of Taiwan.

The estimate here suggests that amphibious assaults, projecting ground
forces from sea to land, against a determined adversary making prudent
doctrinal and technological choices, remain complex and demanding. There
is little doubt that [in a war that the US stayed out of, China
would]{.underline} probably [eventually prevail]{.underline} at least as
far as [neutralising Taiwan\'s air force and navy]{.underline}, if not
simply sending repeated waves of ground troops if it could keep enough
sea and airlift capability. But [it would be **costly**]{.underline},
**[protracted]{.underline}** [and **geopolitically
dangerous**]{.underline}. This problem is reflected also in the
projections of future campaigns by the US Marine Corps, the world\'s
premier amphibious force. Its \'Expeditionary Force 21\' concept
predicts that ever longer range capabilities, such as precision guided
missiles, along with widely available and cheap sensors like nautical
radar, \'will force the fleet to stay at least 65 nautical miles
offshore, a dozen times the distance that existing Marine amphibious
vehicles are designed to swim\' (Freedberg 2014)

Of course, this is about more than capabilities. There is no certain way
to measure the political will of either side in a neat cost-benefit
calculus. To itself and its hostile larger neighbour, Taiwan represents
something bigger politically than just an island with resources, and the
history of the issue is drenched with emotion. We can estimate, however,
what an attempted conquest would entail and the kinds of costs and risks
that the invader would be wise to consider. The longer the struggle
continued, the greater fear of it escalating and drawing in other
powers. Taiwan\'s objective would be to pose the question to China of
just how large a sacrifice it was prepared to make to achieve its
objectives. [Despite the eroding defence advantages and closing gap
between China and Taiwan\'s forces, Taiwan could still inflict
**grave**]{.underline}, possibly **[prohibitive costs]{.underline}** on
the invader. [China\'s increasing airpower \'edge\' and strengthening
cross-strait strike and invasion capabilities **would not be
enough**]{.underline} [to negate the]{.underline} possibility of
exploiting geography to the [defender\'s decisive
advantage]{.underline}. Taiwan\'s objective, within reach of its
capabilities, would not be to sink/ destroy China\'s navy and air force,
but to make adventurism very expensive, to the point where successful
conquest would set its military back years if not decades. This confirms
the recent warning of RAND that [\'forced entry\' via large-scale,
overthe-shore amphibious assault against resistance, is
**obsolete**]{.underline} for many environments (Davis and Wilson 2011:
13-14).

What does all this mean in the bigger picture? [[It
should]{.underline}]{.mark} both caution and
**[[reassure]{.underline}]{.mark}** [US
[policymakers]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Taiwan can present]{.mark} an
ominous [defence]{.mark} against an invader **[without
America]{.mark}**]{.underline} going to the trouble of ramping up its
security assistance and arms trade with Taiwan, and the deterioration of
relations with China that this may create. [Taiwan\'s [vulnerability
is]{.mark} **easily [exaggerated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In terms of its
ability to conquer, [[a rising China is **not**]{.mark} as strategically
[threatening]{.mark} as]{.underline} sometimes [assumed]{.underline}.
This is also important for the wider security environment. Contrary to
the views of some observers, [[it is **not** clear]{.mark} that [Beijing
has]{.mark} an [appetite for limitless expansion]{.mark}, or that
China\'s strategy of\'peaceful rise\' is comparable to]{.underline} that
of [the Third Reich]{.underline}. [But **[even if]{.mark}** China does
increase its appetite and make a bid for region-wide
supremacy]{.underline}, now or in the future, [[conditions are **not
promising**]{.underline}]{.mark} [for a would-be conqueror]{.underline}.
[East Asia is **not**]{.underline} [a power]{.underline} vacuum open to
the predations of [a single aggressor like Nazi Germany or Imperial
Japan]{.underline}, but a region crowded with [states
developing]{.underline} their own [formidable defensive maritime-air
capabilities to deter and respond to one power\'s
adventurism]{.underline}.

The other side of that coin is that American military power is more
greatly constrained than before. If it is true that the home defender
enjoys advantage against the cross-sea invader, so too does China\'s
geographic and strategic position make life increasingly difficult for
America as an Asia-Pacific power. China\'s greater proximity to Taiwan
in West Pacific or East Asian waters combined with its growing capacity
for access and area denial threatens America\'s ability to intervene at
acceptable cost, and more broadly therefore to maintain its credibility
as a security guarantor. It is harder for America to function as the
guardian of the Pacific region if its ability to operate there is
strained and it can no longer act as though the sea lanes were its
uncontested lake. This poses difficulties to America\'s \'air-sea
battle\' concept. Washington\'s \'pivot\' towards Asia is \'a
foreign-policy enterprise by which US joint forces concentrate for
action in remote theaters. The military must mass strategically
significant quantities of soldiers and armaments in a contested theatre
like the Far East, surmounting both transoceanic distances and regional
antagonists\' attempts to veto intervention\' (Holmes 2013a). The
increasing range and lethality of weapons systems coupled with the
determination of states to defend themselves means that, paradoxically,
the growing capacity of states to strike over range has also empowered
defenders to an unusual degree.

We are left with a paradox. On the one hand, today\'s war-making tools
with their reach seem to have collapsed distance in a physical sense. On
the other hand, as this chapter demonstrates, it seems prima facie that
the conquest of territory against defenders with a minimal level of will
and capability mostly no longer pays. [The greater reach and lethality
of weapons today empowers defenders as well as attackers, and, at least
in the case of attempted territorial expansion across bodies of water,
there remains an **overall [imbalance]{.mark} that [favours
defenders]{.mark}**]{.underline} if they are willing and competent
enough to resist. [The likely [costs of conquest]{.mark}]{.underline}
most of the time [[make it **prohibitively
difficult**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Measured in these terms, for would-be
conquerors and for those who would ride to the rescue of the conquered,
the world has never been so large.

25 Feb 2022 \-\--[The use of artificial intelligence ([AI]{.mark}) [in
ag]{.mark}riculture [poses **substantial risks** to **food
security**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} warns a risk analysis from the
University of Cambridge's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk
(CSER). "The idea of intelligent machines running farms is not science
fiction. Large companies are already pioneering the next generation of
autonomous ag-bots and decision support systems that will replace humans
in the field," says Dr. Asaf Tzachor, University of Cambridge, CSER.
"But so far, no-one seems to have asked the question 'Are there any
risks associated with a rapid deployment of agricultural AI?'" he adds.
The researchers warn that [the [risks of AI]{.mark} to farming and food
security are "poorly understood and under-appreciated" and [raise the
alarm about **cyber attackers**]{.mark} potentially [disrupting
farms]{.mark} by poisoning datasets, shutting down sprayers, autonomous
drones and robotic harvesters.]{.underline} Capacity to destabilize
cities Despite the considerable promise of AI for improving crop
management and agricultural productivity, potential risks must be
addressed responsibly, the Cambridge researchers urge. [[New
tech]{.mark}nologies [need to be tested]{.mark} adequately in
experimental settings [to ensure **safe and secure** against
**accidental failures**, **unintended consequences**, **and
cyber-attacks**]{.mark}. [Crops that feed millions]{.mark} can be
[rendered]{.mark} [**useless** by a single hack]{.mark}ing
incident.]{.underline} "AI is being hailed as the way to revolutionize
agriculture. As we deploy this technology on a large scale, we should
closely consider potential risks and aim to mitigate those early on in
the technology design," says Dr. Seán Ó héigeartaigh, executive director
of CSER. [The researchers sketch a hypothetical scenario in which
hackers access the AI system that controls]{.underline} drip-irrigation,
tractors, combine harvesters and weather responsive tech on an
[acres-long field of wheat intended to supply bread to cities. A staple
crop **feeding** **millions** of people is rendered useless in one fell
swoop.]{.underline} The analysis "Responsible artificial intelligence in
agriculture requires systemic understanding of risks and externalities"
has been published in Nature Machine Intelligence. The authors provide a
catalog of risks to be considered in the responsible development of AI
for agriculture and ways to address them. To guard against hacking, the
authors suggest that 'white hat hackers' help companies uncover any
security failings during the development phase so that systems are
safeguarded against real hackers. Mitigating accidental AI failure In a
scenario associated with accidental failure, the authors suggest that an
[[AI]{.mark} system]{.underline} programmed to deliver the best crop
yield in the short term might [[ignore the **environment**]{.mark}**al
consequences** of achieving this, leading to overuse of fertilizers and
soil erosion for a long time. Over-application of pesticides in pursuit
of high yields could **[poison ecosystems]{.mark}**; over-application of
nitrogen fertilizer would **[pollute]{.mark}** the **[soil and]{.mark}**
surrounding **[water]{.mark}ways**]{.underline}. The authors suggest
involving applied ecologists in the technology design process to avoid
these scenarios. Autonomous machines could improve the working
conditions of farmers, relieving them of manual labor. However, without
inclusive technology design, socioeconomic inequalities currently
entrenched in global agriculture -- including gender, class, and ethnic
discrimination -- will remain. "Expert AI farming systems that don't
consider the complexities of labor inputs will ignore, and potentially
sustain, the exploitation of disadvantaged communities," warns Tzachor.
Many farmers are already dependent on artificial intelligence for
monitoring and harvesting crops. Dangers of targeting drones Ag-bots,
drones and sensors are already used to gather information on crops and
support farmers' decision-making. This includes detecting diseases or
insufficient irrigation. Self-driving combine harvesters can bring in a
crop without the need for a human operator. While these automated
systems aim to make farming more efficient, save labor costs, optimize
for production and minimize waste, it also relies on AI. It leads to
increased revenues for farmers as a result. Another blind spot in the
use of AI is that small-scale growers, who cultivate most farms
worldwide, are likely to be excluded from AI-related benefits. Poor
internet penetration rates might prevent smallholders from using
advanced technologies, widening the gaps between commercial and
subsistence farmers. Wageningen University and Research (WUR)
researchers are also investigating the impact of AI on the agri-food
space, following US\$2.5 million in funding from the Nederlandse
Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO).

**[2ac -- Disease !]{.underline}**

#### Absolutely no chance of extinction from disease

**Adalja 16** \[Amesh Adalja, infectious disease physician at the
University of Pittsburgh\] "Why Hasn\'t Disease Wiped out the Human
Race?" June 17, 2016

But when people ask me if I'm worried about infectious diseases, they're
often not asking about the threat to human lives; they're asking about
the threat to human life. [With each outbreak of a headline-grabbing
emerging infectious disease comes a fear of extinction
itself]{.underline}. The fear envisions a large proportion of humans
succumbing to infection, leaving no survivors or so few that the species
can't be sustained. I'm not afraid of this apocalyptic scenario, but I
do understand the impulse. [Worry about the end is a quintessentially
human trait. Thankfully, so is our resilience. For most of mankind's
history, infectious diseases were the existential threat to
humanity---and for good reason. They were quite successful at killing
people]{.underline}: The 6th century's Plague of Justinian knocked out
an estimated 17 percent of the world's population; the 14th century
Black Death decimated a third of Europe; the 1918 influenza pandemic
killed 5 percent of the world; malaria is estimated to have killed half
of all humans who have ever lived. [Any yet, of course, [humanity
continued to flourish.]{.mark} Our species' recent explosion in lifespan
is almost exclusively the result of the control of infectious diseases
**through sanitation, vaccination, and antimicrobial
therapies**]{.underline}. Only in the modern era, in which many
infectious diseases have been tamed in the industrial world, do people
have the luxury of death from cancer, heart disease, or stroke in the
8th decade of life. Childhoods are free from watching siblings and
friends die from outbreaks of typhoid, scarlet fever, smallpox, measles,
and the like. [So **what would it take for a disease to wipe out
humanity now?**]{.underline} In Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain,
the canonical book in the disease-outbreak genre, an alien microbe
threatens the human race with extinction, and humanity's best minds are
marshaled to combat the enemy organism. Fortunately, outside of fiction,
there's no reason to expect alien pathogens to wage war on the human
race any time soon, and [my analysis suggests that any [real-life
domestic microbe reaching]{.mark} an [extinction level]{.mark} of threat
probably [is]{.mark} just as [unlikely]{.mark}. Any [apocalyptic
pathogen would need to]{.mark} possess a very special combination of two
attributes. **First, it would have to [be]{.mark} so [unfamiliar]{.mark}
that no existing therapy or vaccine could be applied to it**. **Second,
it would need to have a high [and]{.mark} surreptitious
[transmissibility]{.mark} before symptoms occur**. The first is
essential because any microbe from a known class of pathogens
would]{.underline}, by definition, [have family members that could serve
as models for containment and countermeasures. The second would allow
the hypothetical disease to spread without being detected by even the
most astute clinicians. The three infectious diseases most likely to be
considered extinction-level threats]{.underline} in the world
today---[[influenza, HIV, and Ebola]{.underline}---[don't
meet]{.underline}]{.mark} [these two [requirements]{.mark}.
Influenza]{.underline}, for instance, despite its well-established
ability to kill on a large scale, its contagiousness, and its unrivaled
ability to shift and drift away from our vaccines, [is still what I
would call a "known unknown."]{.underline} While there are many
mysteries about how new flu strains emerge, from at least the time of
Hippocrates, [humans have been attuned to its risk. And in the modern
era, **a full-fledged industry of influenza preparedness exists**, with
effective **vaccine** strategies and **antiviral** therapies.
HIV]{.underline}, which has killed 39 million people over several
decades, [is similarly limited]{.underline} due to several factors.
[Most importantly, HIV's dependency on]{.underline} blood and [body
fluid for transmission (similar to Ebola) requires **intimate
human-to-human contact, which limits contagion**. Highly potent
antiviral therapy allows most people to live normally with the disease,
and a substantial group of the population has **genetic mutations that
render them impervious** to infection in the first place. Lastly,
**simple prevention strategies** such as needle exchange for injection
drug users and barrier contraceptives---when available---**can curtail
transmission risk**. Ebola, for many of the same reasons as
HIV]{.underline} as well as several others, [also falls short of the
mark.]{.underline} This is especially due to the fact that [it spreads
almost exclusively through people with easily recognizable symptoms,
plus the taming of its]{.underline} once unfathomable 90 percent
[mortality rate by simple supportive care. Beyond those three, [every
other]{.mark} known [disease falls short]{.mark}]{.underline} of what
seems required to wipe out humans---which is, of course, why we're still
here. And it's not that diseases are ineffective. On the contrary,
diseases' failure to knock us out is a testament to just how resilient
humans are. [Part of our [evolutionary heritage is our immune
system]{.mark}, one of the most complex on the planet, [even
**without**]{.mark}]{.underline} the benefit of **[[vaccines]{.mark}
or]{.underline}** the helping hand of antimicrobial [**drugs**. This
[system]{.mark}]{.underline}, when viewed at a species level, [**[can
adapt to]{.mark} almost [any enemy imaginable]{.mark}**[. Coupled to
**genetic variations**]{.mark}]{.underline} amongst humans---[which open
up the possibility for]{.underline} a range of advantages, from
[imperviousness to]{.underline} infection to [a tendency for mild
symptoms---this adaptability ensures that **almost [any infectious
disease]{.mark} onslaught [will leave]{.mark} a [large proportion of the
population alive]{.mark} to rebuild**,]{.underline} in contrast to the
fictional Hollywood versions. While the immune system's role can never
be understated, [an [even more powerful protector is]{.mark} the faculty
of **[consciousness]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Humans are not the most
prolific, quickly evolving, or strongest organisms on the planet, but as
Aristotle identified, **[humans are the rational
animals]{.underline}**---and it is this fundamental distinguishing
characteristic that allows humans to form abstractions, think in
principles, and plan long-range. [These capacities, in turn, allow
[humans]{.mark} to modify, [**alter**, and improve]{.mark} themselves
and [their environments]{.mark}. Consciousness equips us]{.underline},
at an individual and a species level, [to make nature safe]{.underline}
for the species through such technological marvels as antibiotics,
antivirals, vaccines, and sanitation. When humans began to focus their
minds on the problems posed by infectious disease, human life ceased
being nasty, brutish, and short. In many ways, human consciousness
became infectious diseases' worthiest adversary.

How AI Could Enhance Chinese Capability [The most likely sources of a

[would]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[feature]{.mark} the [full spectrum
of]{.mark} **civil and military [info]{.mark}rmation
[operations]{.mark}** [aimed at deterring **U.S. intervention**]{.mark}
and degrading U.S. allies' will to fight[. AI]{.mark} could [play a
dominant role in]{.mark} each of [these]{.mark} missions. The **[Network
Systems Department]{.mark} of the People's Liberation
Army**]{.underline}, for example[, may try using generative language
models to synthesize and amplify content on Facebook and Instagram, as
it has done [us]{.mark}ing **[botnets]{.mark}** and other non-AI tools
[around **Taiwanese elections**]{.mark}. The [Chinese military]{.mark}
is also [likely to wage]{.mark} a similar [campaign to discredit
U.S]{.mark}. [**military activities** or **sow division** with
partners]{.mark}, including Australia and Japan.]{.underline} Soon after
the start of a conflict, [the [P]{.mark}eople's [L]{.mark}iberation
[A]{.mark}rmy [would]{.mark} likely [attack U.S. **sensor and
communication networks**,]{.mark} and several different kinds of
machine-learning applications could aid this task]{.underline}. [A cadre
of scientists at the [P]{.mark}eople's [L]{.mark}iberation
[A]{.mark}rm]{.underline}y National University of Defense Technology,
for example, [[specializes in **"fuzzing,"**]{.mark} using machine
learning to identify vulnerabilities in an adversary's **computer
networks**. Experts [also]{.mark} point to [AI's role in
attacking]{.mark} or defending **[c]{.mark}ritical
[i]{.mark}nfrastructure** in Taiwan, Japan, Australia, or the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [Chinese planners also aim to
use AI for **electronic countermeasures** and operations across the
**electromagnetic spectrum**.]{.underline} For example,
[[analysts]{.mark} from anquan neican]{.underline} (a Chinese journal
for cybersecurity research) [are [optimistic about cognitive
**electronic warfare**]{.mark} --- using AI to analyze incoming **radar
signals**, and then automatically adapting one's own output to optimize
**jamming.**]{.underline} But several other applications of AI also play
a role in electronic spectrum operations. [In 2020]{.underline}, for
example[, the **[P]{.mark}eople's [L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rm**y
[awarded]{.mark} equipment contracts for [**swarms of drones** equipped
with]{.mark} modular **[radar-jamming systems]{.mark}**, [which could be
flown near **U.S. carrier**]{.mark} **strike [groups]{.mark}**[,]{.mark}
military installations in Japan and South Korea, or shared facilities in
the Philippines. [Many systems under]{.mark} development by
[Chinese]{.mark} universities and military research [institutions
are]{.mark} [explicitly designed to counter **U.S. drone
systems**]{.mark} and swarm concepts. Chinese companies have already
exported drones]{.underline} [to Nigeria, the United Arab Emirates, and
Egypt, among others]{.underline}. However, while some People's
Liberation Army experts contend that these drones have been "battle
tested," others are less sanguine about their capabilities in a real
conflict. Moreover[, the [P]{.mark}eople's [L]{.mark}iberation
[A]{.mark}rmy [may attempt to use AI to enhance]{.mark} the
**[lethality]{.mark}** and **reach** [of]{.mark} its surface
[ships]{.mark} and anti-access and area denial systems, [which could
hold U.S. forces at risk]{.mark} during a crisis]{.underline}. China's
current approach to territorial defense relies on hundreds of short- to
long-range ballistic missiles that would target U.S. aircraft carriers
and strike aircraft based in mainland Japan, Okinawa, South Korea, and
as far away as Guam. As early as 2016, [Wang Changqing]{.underline},
director of the General Design Department of the China Aerospace Science
and Industry Corporation[, claimed that the company's next generation of
cruise missiles would use AI to adapt to specific combat conditions,
being capable of adjusting flight profiles and even warhead
yield]{.underline}. Chinese defense industry engineers appear inspired
by the U.S. Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile, which uses AI to improve
accuracy and achieve more flexible targeting. Finally, [the
[P]{.mark}eople's [Li]{.mark}beration [A]{.mark}rmy is [building]{.mark}
a wide array of **[autonomous vehicles]{.mark}** and extensive
**undersea sensor networks** that make use of AI and **big-data
analytics**. These systems may be useful in [recording and
transmitting]{.mark} the [locations of U.S. undersea vehicles,]{.mark}
and would be crucial to overcoming the Chinese military's disadvantages
in undersea warfare. Large [unmanned submarines]{.mark}]{.underline},
such as the HSU-001 and Haishen-6000, [[could]{.mark} [be]{.mark}
[equipped with sea mines to deny the **U.S. Navy access**]{.mark} to
undersea space between the first and second island chains, or to
restrict access to the Taiwan or Luzon Straits.]{.underline} Of course,
AI has the potential to revolutionize Chinese operations in countless
other ways, including through predictive maintenance, logistics, and
back-office tasks not discussed in depth in this article. In any case,
it is clear that the People's Liberation Army is banking on the
technology to create asymmetric advantages vis-a-vis the United States.

Advisor,

/kch\]

After a Congressional override of a Presidential veto, the National
Defense Authorization Act became law on January 1, 2021 (NDAA). Notably,
[the NDAA not only provides appropriations for military and defense
purposes but, under Division E, it also includes the most significant
U.S. legislation concerning artificial intelligence (AI) to date: The
National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020
(NAIIA).]{.underline} [The NAIIA sets forth a multi-pronged national
strategy and funding approach to **spur AI research, development and
innovation** within the U.S., train and **prepare an AI-skilled
workforce** for the integration of AI throughout the **economy** and
**society**, and establish a pathway to position the **U.S. as a global
leader** in the development and adoption of **trustworthy** **AI** in
the public and private sectors]{.underline}. Importantly, the NAIIA does
not set forth merely lofty goals, but rather, [legislates concrete
matters of critical importance for **economic and national
security**]{.underline}. With a new Administration in place, and
increasing global competition to develop AI and related guidelines, this
is undoubtedly a pivotal time in history. AI will continue to transform
every industry and workplace, and every facet of our day-to-day lives.
It is important to become familiar with the NAIIA and consider its
long-term impact for society, including the legal and ethical
ramifications if the goals are not met. To understand the legal,
regulatory and business challenges associated with AI, all organizations
should gain a better understanding of the NAIIA and keep apprised of
developments as the newly formed governing bodies created under the
NAIIA begin their work.

National AI Initiative

The NAIIA aims to achieve its goals through a Presidential National AI
Initiative involving coordination among the civilian agencies, the
Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community and by engaging the
public and private sectors through various key activities, including,
but not limited to:

[Funding, cooperative agreements, testbeds, and access to data and
computing resources to support research and development;]{.underline}

[Educational and training programs to prepare the workforce to create,
use, and interact with AI systems;]{.underline}

[Interagency planning and coordination of Federal AI research,
development, demonstration, and standards engagement;]{.underline}

[Outreach to diverse stakeholders such as citizen groups, industry,
civil rights and disability rights organizations for input on
initiatives;]{.underline}

[Support for a network of interdisciplinary AI research
institutes]{.underline}; and

[Support opportunities for international cooperation around AI research
and development.]{.underline}

Governance Structures

To drive toward these goals, the NAIIA mandates establishment of various
governance bodies. First, on January 12, 2021, pursuant to the NAIIA,
the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)
established the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office (AI
Initiative Office). Second, the [NAIIA requires the creation of the
Interagency Committee and various subcommittees on AI to coordinate
federal activities and create a strategic plan for AI (including with
regard to research and development, education and workforce
training).]{.underline} Third, the law mandates that the Secretary of
Commerce, in consultation with the Director of OSTP, Secretary of
Defense, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of State, the Attorney General,
and the Director of National Intelligence, establish a National
Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee comprised of appointed
members representing broad and interdisciplinary expertise and
perspectives to serve as advisors to the President and the Initiative
Office on matters related to the AI Initiative. Fourth, the NAIIA also
requires the Director of the National Science Foundation and the OSTP to
establish the National AI Research Resource Task Force. In particular,
the [National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee will advise on
**research** and **development, ethics, standards, education,
security,** AI in the workplace and consequences of technological
displacement, and other economic and societal issues addressed by the
Initiative]{.underline}. Further, the body will advise on matters
relating to oversight of AI using regulatory and nonregulatory
approaches while balancing innovation and individual rights. The
Committee will also [establish a sub-committee related to AI in law
enforcement and will address such issues as bias and proper usage of
facial recognition, as well as **data security and use of AI consistent
with privacy, civil and disability rights.**]{.underline}

National Academies AI Impact Study on the Workforce

The NAIIA also requires the National Science Foundation to contract with
the National Research Council of the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine to conduct a study regarding the current and
future impact of AI on the U.S. workforce. This study will include input
from various stakeholders in the public and private sectors, and result
in recommendations regarding the challenges and opportunities presented.
The study will address the impact of increased use of AI, automation and
related trends on the workforce, the related workforce needs and
employment opportunities, and the research gaps and data needed to
address these issues. The results of the study will be published in a
report to several Congressional Committees and available publicly by
January 1, 2023.

Funding of AI Initiatives

A hallmark of the NAIIA is its commitment to inject the economy with
funding to boost AI efforts. In total, the [NAIIA pumps approximately
\$6.4 billion dollars into AI activities under the
Initiative.]{.underline} This funding is earmarked in a variety of ways.
For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
received Congress' authorization to spend almost \$400 million over 5
years to [support development of frameworks for research and development
best practices and voluntary standards for AI trustworthiness,
including:]{.underline}

[Privacy and security]{.underline} (including for data sets used to
train or test AI systems, and software and hardware used in AI systems);

[Computer chips and hardware designed for AI systems;]{.underline}

[Data management and techniques to increase usability of
data;]{.underline}

[Development of technical standards and guidelines to test for
bias]{.underline} in AI training data and applications;

[Safety]{.underline} and robustness of AI to withstand unexpected inputs
and adversarial attacks;

[Auditing mechanisms]{.underline};

[Applications of machine learning and AI to improve science and
engineering]{.underline}; and

[Model and system documentation.]{.underline}

NIST will also [work on the creation of a **risk management framework**,
standardized data sets for AI training, partnership with research
institutes to test AI measurement standards and develop data sharing
best practices.]{.underline} The National Science Foundation will
receive almost \$4.8 billion over 5 years to fund research and education
in AI systems and related fields (including K-12, undergraduate and
graduate programs), to develop and deploy trustworthy AI, workforce
training and development of a diverse AI workforce pipeline. The
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will receive
\$10,000,000 in 2021 towards its AI Center. Subject to the availability
of funding, the Director of the National Sciences Foundation will
establish a program to award financial assistance for the planning and
establishment of a network of AI Institutes for research and development
and attainment of related goals as set forth under the NAIIA. These AI
Institutes would be eligible to receive funding in order to manage and
make available data sets for training and testing AI, develop AI
testbeds, conduct specific research and education activities, provide or
broker access to computing resources and technical assistance, and
conduct other collaborative outreach activities. There have been
tremendous advancements in the development of AI in recent years,
exponentially greater than experienced in the early days of its
development in the last century. AI is no longer a matter of science
fiction and it is quickly becoming a mainstream reality with a major
impact on every aspect of our lives. Through passage of the NAIIA, [the
U.S. has demonstrated its commitment to responsibly investing in the
future of AI, including preparing the public, industry and the future
workforce for the new world that has arrived.]{.underline} To learn more

When the world's first power plant switched on in 1882 --- steam
engines, fired by coal, lighting lower Manhattan --- policymakers
probably didn't ask what this breakthrough would mean for America's
rivalry with Germany, the rising industrial and military power of the
day. [This century's breakthrough technology is **artificial
intelligence**]{.underline}, as consequential today as electricity was
to the 19th century. [[Which nation leads on AI will lead on]{.mark},
well, [everything]{.mark}. And that brings us to America's rapidly
escalating conflict with today's rising power**, China.** AI will
profoundly improve **human society**]{.underline}, affecting the daily
lives of people in every corner of the world. If you've ever tried
Google Translate and been frustrated (or amused) by the results, you can
imagine the benefits of truly intelligent translations that communicate
the full cultural or social meaning into a new language. [AI researchers
are on the path to achieving this sort of breakthrough, which will
revolutionize the ease and clarity with which we communicate across
borders, cultures and societies.]{.underline} And that's just a start.
[**[Ar]{.mark}tificial [i]{.mark}ntelligenc**e [is more important than
any]{.mark} single country's [agenda]{.mark}. It's a breakthrough that
transcends **national rivalries**.]{.underline} And yet, [we can be sure
AI will be **weaponized** both literally and figuratively. The [US and
China]{.mark} are [racing to establish]{.mark} AI [advantage]{.mark},
[**economic and military**]{.mark} alike. An early flashpoint in the
fight is Huawei. The [US]{.mark} is [determined to prevent]{.mark} its
[allies from partnering with]{.mark} the [Chinese]{.mark}
telecommunications giant to build next-generation 5G wireless networks.
We are fast entering a **new Cold War** where a modern-day bamboo
curtain may separate **Chinese AI systems** from **Western
systems**]{.underline}. It's Betamax vs VHS with military reinforcement.
Whose technology will dominate the AI era? Here's the bottom line: [[no
country is in a stronger position]{.mark} to craft a framework
[for]{.mark} global [AI norms than America]{.mark}. We have the [world's
largest **economy**]{.mark}, the [most advanced **military** and]{.mark}
competitive [advantage in AI **research**]{.mark} **and education**. No
country has played a more important role in establishing the rules
governing global policymaking than America]{.underline}. A Center for
Data Innovation study out this summer found that [the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is]{.mark} indeed [ahead]{.mark} on AI --- for now.
[But China]{.mark} is rapidly [closing the gap]{.mark}]{.underline}.
What next? [[It's time for America to step up]{.mark} and create a
**global framework for AI**. [What we do in America]{.mark} should [set
a course for the rest of the world to follow]{.mark}. [China
included]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some politicians and policymakers in
Washington and Silicon Valley believe the government should regulate AI
as little as possible, leaving markets alone. This instinct is a useful
counterweight to excessive regulation, but a simplistic view of the
government's economic and industrial contributions. And, we can be sure
the Chinese approach will not be laissez-faire. The truth is the public
sector plays multiple roles. In the case of new products or services, it
acts as regulator, promoter, standard-setter, purchaser and rule-maker
of global policy. Only the government can outline a comprehensive
strategy for when and how to engage in all these AI policy parameters.
Despite early efforts by the Trump Administration to call attention to
AI, fitful steps by individual members of Congress and ad hoc
contributions from cities and states, most of the policy framework for
AI is not yet mature. For instance, there is no agreement about how to
prepare for the adoption of AI in the workplace and no national privacy
policy. We have no uniform rules for how consumer data must be
safeguarded and how it may be used. We have no plan for multilateral
coordination with other countries. Above all, there is quite literally
no one in the United States in charge of its national AI policy. [The
time has come for a policy architecture that permits the United
States]{.underline} --- through its federal government, cooperating with
business and civil society --- [to speak definitively, ethically and
with detail about AI rules for everything from workers' rights to
responsible uses of facial recognition technology and autonomous drones
in armed conflict. The US needs this not only for its own needs, but to
provide a path for the rest of the world to follow.]{.underline} With
thoughtful action, we can shape whose vision of the public interest will
infuse AI: the liberal Western vision, or the Chinese, collectivist,
authoritarian vision? For a Western definition of public interest to
prevail, we need a set of international trade rules to guide the AI era.
These rules should help open markets, protect intellectual property,
minimize coerced tech transfer and do away with unfair government
subsidies for AI. The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development has made initial, think tank-style recommendations and
the World Economic Forum is helping keep AI on the agenda among global
business leaders. These are a good start, but not sufficient. The
American agenda should focus on the adoption of a uniform framework that
protects users' data without stifling commerce. It should include the
right of citizens to learn what data is being collected on them, the
right to say "no," and sensible and workable rules for correcting and
deleting data. Further, a new global AI standard should place strict
limitations of the use of AI tools for intrusive government
surveillance. A new AI framework should mandate accountability through
mandatory disclosures to assure fairness, reliability, accuracy and
assurance of diversity of data collection. [This American agenda will
pave a path for like-minded countries to follow. We can resist Chinese
pressure, but only if we come together in common cause. [The
alternative]{.mark} to US leadership [may be a **Balkanized
constellation**]{.mark} of policies and regulations. [Or]{.mark}, worse,
a **Manichean [world]{.mark}** [where nations are forced to pick
between]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and
China]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [It is time for the US to lead on
AI in a way that the world will follow. T]{.underline}he first step is
to get behind a push at home for a national AI policy. [We can't afford
to let others write the rules for this critical component of the global
economy while we debate --- or sleep.]{.underline}

### 2ac -- Central Investment Fails 

#### China's approach to AI development creates spending issues and careless mindsets with no accountability 

**Roberts et al. 20** (Huw Roberts, Oxford Internet Institute, "The
Chinese Approach to Artificial Intelligence: an Analysis of Policy,
Ethics, and Regulation", June 17, 2020, AI & Soc 36, 59-77, Springer
Link)//SW

Concerning local governments, the political structure within China
creates a system of incentives for fulfilling national government policy
aims. Short term limits for provincial politicians and promotions based
on economic performance provide strong incentives for following
centrally-defined government initiatives (Li and
Zhou [[2005]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00992-2#ref-CR103);
Persson and
Zhuravskaya [[2016]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00992-2#ref-CR133)).
Thus, local governments become hotbeds for testing and developing
central government policy. The strength of this incentive system can be
seen in the decision made by the administration of the city of Tianjin
to establish a \$5 billion fund for the development of AI, around the
same time as the publication of the AIDP
(Mozur [[2017]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00992-2#ref-CR123)).
At the same time[, it is important to recognize how the **absence of an
effective accountability review of local government spending creates
problems within this system**. Notably, it has facilitated a mindset in
which **local politicians know that the central government will bail
them out for failed projects**, leading to poor budget management
(Ji [2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00992-2#ref-CR78)).
A clear example of this is the large-scale **port building initiatives**
developed by provincial governments in East coast provinces that were
**based more on prestige than any economic rationale**, and which led to
overcapacity and disorderly competition]{.underline}
(Zhu [[2019]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00992-2#ref-CR189)).

These incentive structures contain a subtle distinction. A national team
has been selected to lead the research and development in a handful of
designated strategic areas. Beyond these selected companies[, there are
few specific guidelines provided to industry and local state agents as
to which items to pursue on the AIDP's 'wish list'.]{.underline} This
enables companies to cherry-pick the technologies they want to develop
and provides local governments with a choice of private sector partners
for integrating AI into city infrastructure or governance
(Sheehan [[2018]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00992-2#ref-CR145)).
Subsequent documentation has emphasised the importance of strengthening
organisation and
implementation,[^[Footnote4]{.underline}^](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00992-2#Fn4) including
between provinces and ministries, yet it is unclear how this
coordination would function in practice. [**Thus, the AIDP may work as a
'wish list', but the exact guidance, incentivisation and risk differ
depending on the type of stakeholder**.]{.underline}

#### Chinese firms lack incentive to innovate and are stifled by uncertain regulation and business environment

**Li et al. 21** (Daitian Li, Assistant Professor at the University of
Electronic Science & Technology of China, Harvard Business Review, "Is
China Emerging as the Global Leader in AI", February 18, 2021)//SW

By many indicators, China is now on the global frontier of AI in terms
of technological development and market applications. The unique
technological, market, policy environments that Chinese firms face in
the emerging AI sector have given them a window of opportunity to catch
up with global leaders rapidly.

But, paradoxically, while China may have caught up in record time[, the
conditions that have allowed it to do so may impede its further
development in AI.]{.underline}

For example, given the open science nature of AI and the advantages of
being quick followers, [**Chinese firms often lack strong incentives to
invest in developing core AI technologie**s. Unlike in Western developed
economies where companies are the primary holders of AI patents, in
China, the **majority of AI patents are filed** by universities and
research institutes, most of which **are government owned** or
sponsored. However**, university-industry linkages in China are
relatively weak**, and technology transfer remains rather limited.
Overall, although aggregate AI research outputs (e.g., scientific
publications, patents) are rising rapidly in China, **truly original
ideas and breakthrough technologies are lacking.**]{.underline}

Further, [the **uncertain business environment in China, coupled with
the huge market for AI products and Chinese consumers' enthusiasm to
adopt them, leads companies and investors to favor applied AI research
that can bring quick money** instead of more basic research that
promises to have long-lasting impacts]{.underline}. At a more
fundamental level, the research culture in China needs a great deal of
improvement, [as many researchers have
highlighted](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1196916).

On the policy front, [the **relaxed regulatory environment** has proved
to be a double-edged sword]{.underline}. While some firms are bold
enough to take advantage of such environment by aggressively pushing
different AI applications to markets, [others feel frustrated as **they
don't know what is allowed due to such policy
uncertainty**]{.underline}. The chairman of Suzhou Blue Amber Medi-Tech,
a medical device company, lamented that this uncertainty has led his
company to decide to not touch any data that might fall into certain
gray areas (e.g., use of personal health data for other commercial
purposes). "Our current thinking is that if we don't need to touch the
data, we will not touch it. ... But, if we do not touch the data, a
significant part of the value \[of the data\] is not realized. So, from
our company's point of view, we do hope that the government will make
the regulations clear sooner."

### 2ac -- US ahead now

**US is the most dominant in AI, and will continue in the future**

Naomi **Davies**, 11-18-20**21**, an FDI consultant at Investment
Monitor\"Index shows US is winning the AI race -- but for how long?,\"
Investment Monitor,
https://www.investmentmonitor.ai/ai/ai-index-us-china-artificial-intelligence

[The [US](https://investmentmonitor.ai/manufacturing/the-state-of-play-fdi-in-the-us) is
the leading country in *Investment Monitor*'s first ranking assessing
investor friendliness within the AI space.]{.underline} The US holds
first place in eight out of 17 indicators analysed, including metrics
such as e-participation, investment in emerging technologies and
software spending as a percentage of GDP.

[According to figures from GlobalData, more than 8,300 AI deals were
recorded in the US in the five years up to November 2021. This is more
than triple the amount of its closest
competitor [China](https://investmentmonitor.ai/asia-pacific/the-state-of-play-fdi-in-china-2)]{.underline},
which recorded approximately 2,500 deals during the same period.

Notable deals in the US include California-based Teledyne
Technologies' [[\$8.2bn
acquisition]{.underline}](https://www.flir.co.uk/news-center/corporate-news/teledyne-completes-acquisition-of-flir/) of
Oregon's FLIR Systems in May 2021. The newly named Teledyne FLIR
develops intelligent sensing solutions for defence, industrial and
commercial applications. When combined with the company's cloud
platform, its traffic system cameras use AI to predict traffic,
preventing congestion and potential accidents.

More than 58,000 AI-related patents were registered in the US between
November 2016 and 2021, cementing its status as a hub for innovation. It
is also home to some of the world's most successful tech companies
including six of the 'Big Nine', the nickname for the nine tech
companies dominating the AI landscape. The US members
are [[Amazon]{.underline}](https://investmentmonitor.ai/distribution/what-will-amazon-do-next),
Apple, [[Facebook]{.underline}](https://investmentmonitor.ai/ict-and-internet-infrastructure/what-will-facebook-do-next), [[Google]{.underline}](https://investmentmonitor.ai/rd/what-will-google-do-next),
IBM and Microsoft.

In addition, [the US offers investors access to a rich pool of
AI [talent](https://investmentmonitor.ai/global/fdi-drivers-and-the-quest-for-talent),
bolstered by a substantial number of international researchers who move
there for work]{.underline}. According to [[MacroPolo's Global AI Talent
Tracker]{.underline}](https://macropolo.org/digital-projects/the-global-ai-talent-tracker/),
nearly 60% of top-tier researchers are employed by US institutions.

[[Singapore]{.underline}](https://investmentmonitor.ai/singapore/the-state-of-play-fdi-in-singapore) ranks
second in *Investment Monitor*'s AI Index. The city-state scores highly
across multiple indicators including its government's promotion of
investment in emerging technologies.

In June 2017, AI Singapore was established to boost the city-state's AI
standing. As part of a national programme, a total of \$150m will be
invested in 100 AI-related projects to solve real-world problems across
finance, healthcare and city management by mid-2022.

The government's National AI Strategy was launched in November 2019,
listing five national AI projects to encourage social and economic
growth in areas including transport and logistics, healthcare, education
and safety and security. The Model AI Governance Framework was also
established as part of the strategy, providing private companies with
detailed guidance on moral and governance issues when implementing AI
solutions.

In recent years, the city-state has become a hub for [[industry
4.0]{.underline}](https://investmentmonitor.ai/manufacturing/industry-4-0-the-revolution-investors-cannot-ignore) and
advanced manufacturing. More than three-quarters of Singapore's total
manufacturing output is in high and medium-high technology. Many key
global suppliers including ABB and Siemens have established advanced
manufacturing centres of excellence there.

Singapore is one of three Asia-Pacific countries to rank in the top ten
of the AI Index,
with [[Japan]{.underline}](https://investmentmonitor.ai/japan/the-state-of-play-fdi-in-japan) and [[South
Korea]{.underline}](https://investmentmonitor.ai/south-korea/the-state-of-play-fdi-in-south-korea) placing
fifth and sixth, respectively.

In 2017, the Chinese government announced its intention to become the
world's leading AI hub by 2030, with a strategy focused on investing in
research and retaining domestic talent.

Despite this, China ranks outside of the index's top ten countries. It
scores poorly across various metrics including its ICT regulatory
environment, software spending as a percentage of GDP and intellectual
property receipts as a percentage of total trade.

[The first stage of the AI development plan aimed to close the gap
between China and the world's leading AI hubs by 2020. Research from
GlobalData shows this is not the case, with China still lagging far
behind the US in terms of the number of AI-related deals, fillings, jobs
and patents recorded.]{.underline}

[While the US remains the current AI leader, it must remain vigilant to
stay ahead. Research by the [Centre for Data
Innovation](https://datainnovation.org/2019/08/who-is-winning-the-ai-race-china-the-eu-or-the-united-states/) suggests
that the US should focus on increasing research funding and developing
local talent.]{.underline}

#### **US maintains AI lead against China with strong universities, private sector, investment and start-up culture**

Tony **Bertuca 18** (Tony Bertuca, Chief Editor of Inside the Pentagon,
Inside Washington, "Inside the Army", March 19, 2018, Vol. 30, No. 11,
JSTOR)//SW

[The **United States has a "healthy,"** but tenuous **lead over China in
artificial intelligence**]{.underline} and quantum computing, according
to the head of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity.
Jason Metheny, the director of IARPA, an organization within the Office
of the Director of National Intelligence tasked with running advanced
research programs for the U.S. intelligence community, said the United
States has a tendency to be "alarmist" when it comes to other nations'
technological advancements. "I'm not a catastrophist when it comes to
this race between the U.S. and China," he told reporters at breakfast in
Washington. "I think the United States does have a healthy lead. It
doesn't mean that we're guaranteed to have that lead forever and
regardless of policy or investment," he continued. ["This is a lead that
was **earned through it being a priority within the science and
technology organizations**. We need to continue recognizing it's
important to maintain the lead."]{.underline} Metheny said China is the
United States' strongest competitor globally in machine learning and has
a "very thoughtful" AI strategy, which calls for becoming a global
leader in the arena by 2025. "It's basically a Chinese translation of
the U.S. AI plan, which I worked on \-- there were a lot of familiar
passages," he said. "But they've also introduced an implementation plan
for that AI strategy that includes quantitative milestones in speech
recognition, imagery analysis, video analysis that are, I think,
realistic, but also ambitious." China also enjoys tighter civil-military
integration than the United States does, which combines to provide a
whole-of-nation effort. Still, Metheny said, such government-directed
integration can be a disadvantage[. "I think that the United States has
an advantage in its competitive landscape," he said. "We have the
**strongest universities** by far. We have the **strongest start-up
culture and we also have risk-tolerant companies like Google and
Microsoft and Amazon and Open AI that are willing to fund very high-risk
research that may not pay out for five to 10 years**." Additionally,
Metheny said all of IARPA's unclassified research contracts are awarded
competitively. "**We engage our researchers in tournaments in which
multiple research teams compete against one another** toward a common
set of technical goals that have highly ambitious milestones," he said.
IARPA is also the world's largest source of academic research funding in

#### Chinese business ecosystem cannot keep up with US AI specialists

However, [the **scientific value of the Chinese AI research shaft is not
great. American publications in this area have a citation index of 50%
higher** than Chinese.]{.underline} Among the patents filed, 87% are for
utility models and industrial designs, and only 2% for fundamental
research

[Moreover, the **number of national AI talents does not satisfy even the
Chinese government**. According to the MIIT, about 5 million specialists
are needed to successfully solve the national AI sector's tasks

[Nevertheless, it will be i**mpossible to solve scientific and
especially practical competence lag so quickly. The reason is the
immaturity of the Chinese AI business ecosystem**. American AI talents
have gone through many project cycles.]{.underline} [The number of
**American specialists employed in AI with over ten years of experience
is** approaching 30% and amounts to **850 thousand** people

There are **only 50 thousand such specialists in China**, and **43% came
from the United States**

### 2ac -- China isn't transparent

#### Unlike China, the US establishes reports to address the transparency and trustworthy of AI with ethical standards

TOKYO \-- Artificial intelligence, like other forms of technology,
reflects the culture and values of the people who create it and those
who provide the data frameworks upon which it is built. AI technology
developed in different countries or organizations may thus offer
different answers to the same problem.

On June 25, the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence,
an independent [U.S. government body, released, \"The Role of AI
Technology in Pandemic Response and Preparedness: Recommended
Investments and Initiatives.\"]{.underline} The report makes 10
recommendations, including calls for the creation of a federal
\"Pandemic Preparedness Dataset\" and investment in \"the digital
modernization of state and local health infrastructure required for
effective disease surveillance.\" It was the commission\'s third report
published since May 6 on AI and the government\'s response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. The commission\'s so-called COVID-19 White Paper
Series [deals with **fundamental ethical issues** related to the use of
AI in policy **responses to the crisis**, including **privacy** and the
**responsibilities** of software developers.]{.underline} The commission
has tried to help [establish **clear** government positions on these
issues, and to present them to Congress and the American
people.]{.underline} This is time-consuming, but despite the urgency of
the pandemic, the government must follow democratic processes when
deciding how to spend taxpayer money. China, by contrast, has been very
quick to wield AI in its battle against the disease. AI has been used to
identify individuals in contact tracing and to predict how the virus
spreads. Infection rates for the novel coronavirus are far over 15,000
per million people in the U.S. and Brazil, as of Thursday. The official
figure for China, where the pandemic started, is 62, although there is
some doubt about the credibility of the Chinese data. There is no
denying that a society that puts the collection of personal data needed
to track a virus ahead of the protection of privacy can, in theory, do a
better job containing an outbreak of infectious disease. The pandemic
has brought to the fore wide differences in values and cultural norms
between nations. Shigeo Kawashima, an associate professor at Aoyama
Gakuin University who studies the interaction between society and
technology, believes the world has reached a historical crossroads with
regard to the evolution of AI. The question, Kawashima says, is \"which
country will be able to build an AI-driven society where people, not
machines, play the central role.\"

Human interaction with technology is not culturally universal or
value-neutral.

\"Western society, which is based on monotheistic Christianity and
Judaism, and Chinese society, which is based on materialism and Marxism,
naturally have different ethical systems,\" Kawashima said. An emerging
field of research called explainable AI, or XAI, highlights this. XAI
refers to a way of applying AI that ensures the process of AI-based
decision-making can be understood by humans. XAI can \"explain\" how it
makes specific decisions.

The U.S. Defense Department\'s Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, or DARPA, is leading the way in this area of research. [The U.S.
military is keen to develop computer systems that produce **transparent
explanations for the decisions made by AI systems**]{.underline}, even
though they tend to be reluctant to disclose their activities in
general. This is because [autonomous weapons systems and even autonomous
planning of military operations are already at the stage of practical
application in the U.S. If machines used by the military make choices
that affect human lives \-- whether to bomb a particular target, say \--
the military has a **responsibility to explain** how and why those
decisions are taken.]{.underline} The military must also fully
understand and be able to [explain how and why specific decisions have
been made so it can **trust** the actions of AI systems
themselves.]{.underline} In other words, a military can\'t simply say,
\"Oh sorry, the Ai decided it, not us human.\" XAI is a means of
tackling the \"black box\" problem in machine learning, in which even
system designers cannot explain how their AI arrives at specific
decisions. To take an innocuous example, imagine a system that uses AI
to determine whether an image is that of a cat or a dog. To create such
an AI system, engineers train computers to recognize common patterns
using a huge number of images of cats and dogs, exposing them to
numerous variations, and specifying whether the image in question is a
cat or a dog each time. As they are shown millions of images, computers
learn to tell cats and dogs apart. But using this method, even when the
AI correctly identifies an image as a cat or a dog, one cannot say how
the AI has done so. Decision-making based on machine learning is
inherently a \"black box.\" AI is an opaque technology by its nature.
Different societies breed different kinds of AI. Chinese AI will
certainly become increasingly clever at dazzling speed because of the
huge amounts of data available to AI engineers in the country. Marlon

Shenzen, in 2018. China is increasingly applying AI in health care.
(Photo by Yasu Ota) According to a survey by the Japan Patent Office at
the end of July, Chinese entities filed 6,858 AI patent applications in
2017, overtaking the U.S., with 5,954 filings. The U.S. has lost its
long-held overwhelming edge in AI. With its patent applications doubling
every year, China is on track to become an AI superpower.

Most AI patent applications made in China deal with practical machine
learning; few are related to XAI. China may be first country in the
world to develop black-box AI technologies for health care, autonomous
driving, criminal trials, personnel decisions and other areas. But
[China\'s approach to AI research and development, which is totally
**divorced from ethical considerations**, inevitably raises
concerns.]{.underline} In April 2019, the European Commission\'s High
Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence published its \"Ethics
Guidelines for Trustworthy AI,\" which establish seven key principles,
including transparency, diversity, nondiscrimination and fairness, and
accountability. [In Japan and the U.S., a raft of big companies
including Google, Sony and Fujitsu have established their **own**
**ethical standards** for AI because AI businesses will not be viable
without the trust of users.]{.underline} Hirokazu Anai, senior director
of Artificial Intelligence Lab at Fujitsu Laboratories, once said, \"We
have to prove to our customers that our AI is safe enough and
trustworthy.\" In China, a professional committee operating under the
Ministry of Science and Technology in June issued a set of eight
principles for next-generation AI governance. The principles include
respect for privacy, but it is hard to give much credence to them, given
China\'s authoritarian government. In a nutshell, a [society that places
little value on human dignity **cannot** produce human-centric AI
technology.]{.underline}

BEIJING (CAIXIN GLOBAL) - [A government-backed Chinese consumer group
has accused the nation\'s tech giants of using their data-based
algorithms to **\"bully\" consumers** and **put them at a
disadvantage**.]{.underline} At a symposium on the topic held by the
China Consumers Association (CCA) on Jan. 7, the group released a
three-section, 14-point document outlining the ways [data-driven
algorithms impinge the rights of consumers in their interactions with
large tech platforms, and calling for beefed up powers for
regulators.]{.underline} It\'s the latest sign that the technology
broadly described as [\"artificial intelligence\"]{.underline} - and
specifically algorithm-based advertising and sales - is shaping up as a
new front in the country\'s push to control big tech. And it comes amid
a broader national conversation about how [tech giants use their
technology to **control the information** available to individual
consumers, and **leverage their access** to **personal data for
profit**.]{.underline}

Among the grievances listed by the CCA are complex sales promotions that
obscure the true costs of a product, targeted search results that create
information asymmetry, and [the practice of hiding negative
reviews]{.underline}, which it says [leaves consumers **\"squeezed by
algorithms and the targets of technological bullying.\"**]{.underline}
Of particular concern to the group is the [practice of \"algorithmic
price discrimination,\" where the personal data of an online shopper is
used to calculate different prices for different individuals based on
what they might be willing to pay.]{.underline} The CCA proposed a
series of remedies, including establishing a special organisation to
police algorithmic ethics and investigate \"unfair algorithms,\" and
equip government departments with the ability to regulate them. It also
controversially calls for tech giants to be forced to turn over what has
been described as their \"secret sauce\" - the proprietary algorithms
which underpin their businesses - to regulators in the case of disputes.
The document released by the government-backed group is seen as the
latest evidence China is preparing to publish a draft regulation on
artificial intelligence and algorithms. The CCA called on \"all sectors
of society to work together for ... the fair and reasonable application
of algorithms, and prevent operators from using algorithms to do evil.\"
