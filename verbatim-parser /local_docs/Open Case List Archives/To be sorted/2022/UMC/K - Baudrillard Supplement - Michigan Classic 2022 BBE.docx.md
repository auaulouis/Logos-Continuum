[[The problem of re-grounding feminist politics]{.mark} by use of any
subject-centred politics [can]{.mark} quite easily [be]{.mark}
[unearthed through Baudrillard's critique of liberation. The complicity
of feminist]{.mark} left-wing [nostalgia and]{.mark}
techno-[salvation]{.mark} in late-capitalism [lies in the illusion of
subjective emancipation]{.mark} and communication [that]{.mark}
communicative [capitalism upholds]{.mark} -- communication [technologies
which are]{.mark} the main [exponents of th]{.mark}e deferred promise or
[aporia of Western humanism. Baudrillard claims]{.mark} throughout his
oeuvre that any [contemporary politics]{.mark} that fancies [grounding
itself in]{.mark} the idea of '[expressing and liberating]{.mark}
oneself throu[gh mediated communication' is]{.mark} today [accelerating
the neoliberal machine]{.mark} while living in the hallucination of
facilitating a subversive event. In light of this, it becomes clear that
[feminist nostalgic reminiscence]{.mark} as well as mediated
techno-happy action problematically [repeat the Eurocentric myth of the
humanist European project as a truly emancipatory
affair]{.mark}]{.underline}. They therefore facilitate the emergence of
what I in my work call the speed-elite. Speed-elitist discourses
typically validate connection, instantaneity, liberation, multiplicity
and border-crossing, and often promote highly mediated spaces for action
and communication. [[Such discourses suppress the]{.mark} colonial and
[patriarchal history of those]{.mark} technological spaces and
[dialogues]{.mark}.]{.underline} Speed-elitism, as the contemporary
high-tech exponent of Euro-centrism, fosters an oppressive sort of unity
of struggles through the fantasy of allowing for radical difference. So
[[speed-elitism builds on]{.mark} the [formalisation of]{.mark} racism
and [sexism. The]{.mark} vigorous [reinstallation of mediated
feminist]{.mark}-subjective [activity]{.mark}, [and the]{.mark}
compulsive [quest for salvaging the "subversive" European feminist
project]{.mark} by remediating alterity, precisely marks the moment
where such alterity gets usurped in the myth of transparent
communication that undergirds neoliberal acceleration and
disenfranchisement. [This remediation]{.mark} of alterity [currently
runs through romantic]{.mark} feminist [recuperations of "Muslim women"
and "female migrants" -- as if these groups]{.mark} [somehow
intrinsically challenge neo-liberalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
Braidotti, it works through a misidentification of radical alterity in
those who are becoming nomadic through technological means. In Butler,
it runs through a tension in her work, which concerns her affirmation of
a subjective politics of re-signification based on the notion of
iterability, despite her understanding of such re-signification being
borne out of the subject's lack. [The state of [left-wing feminist
despair should]{.mark} therefore also [be read as pointing towards
the]{.mark} [suppressed history of discursive and material
violence]{.mark} that has been [inflicted on]{.mark} various raced and
classed [others]{.mark} in the past and present [as an intricate part of
European feminism]{.mark} and the techno-scientific project tout court.
[Feminist nostalgia]{.mark} and techno-salvation therefore [function as
false oppositions in the service of speed-elitism.]{.mark} This
opposition dissimulates the feminist subject of politics' complicity in
the perpetuation of the violence of Western humanism]{.underline}. Let
me make clear that my analyses of the feminist speed-elitist subject do
not imply that this critique is itself above such a problematic. After
all, this piece also performs, to use Butler's apt yet often misused
term, my stance as a left-wing feminist subject and as such accelerates
academic production. [This agrees with Baudrillard's point that
increasingly [all forms of politics]{.mark}, insofar as they [come to
exist as mere simulations]{.mark} of politics, are [wrapped]{.mark} up
[in a neoliberal logic that relies on the collapse of the
semiotic]{.mark} into the axiomatic. This collapse is possible, argues
Baudrillard, because the axiomatic has come to rely on the incessant
mediation of signs through the consumption of differentiation between
signs (2001a:105-106). [Signs become objects for consumption]{.mark},
and [difference]{.mark} merely [sustains the exploitation of]{.mark} the
fallacy of [binary oppositions]{.mark} ("self" vis-à-vis "other") for
economic growth. The conceptual distinction between signifier and
signified constitutes for Baudrillard not a universal truth about the
generation of meaning, but marks a historical moment in the evolution of
capitalism.]{.underline} The concept of the signified emerges alongside
the capitalist model of exchange value as a supposed derivative of use
value (Ibid.:103). [Use [value]{.mark} (in the form of needs and
desires), says Baudrillard, just like the signified (or the referent),
[is]{.mark} simply [conjured up as an 'alibi']{.mark} (2001b:78)
[for]{.mark} a [capitalism that justifies itself by positing those
desires for emancipation of the (feminist) subject as natural]{.mark}.
The conclusion for Baudrillard is (1990a), that all [contemporary forms
of]{.mark} (or signs of) [otherness]{.mark}, [and our]{.mark} [desire
to]{.mark} engage with it, [liberate it,]{.mark} ally with it, and
understand it, [are effects of this new stage of capitalism. It relies
on the fallacy that]{.mark} such othe[rness is empirically real and
outside the capitalist logic of the reproduction.]{.mark} Otherness in
feminist politics of alliance and liberation is then relative otherness,
a transparent mirror image of the speed-elitist subject]{.underline}.
The media in particular facilitate this logic because they allow for the
incessant circulation and differentiation of signs. The media provide
the user with the illusion, due to the humanist fantasy of media as
transparent communication, that this "other" authentically wants such
subjective empowerment and alliance -- that we ourselves as much as any
"other" naturally want to be or are foremost subjects (under
neo-liberalism). But such empowerment and connection become mere moments
in the recirculation of signs, and hence of the acceleration of capital.
[Baudrillard concludes that in this new stage of capitalism marked by a
"humanitarian ecumenism" (1990a:131), [the other becomes something to
"be]{.mark} understood, [liberated]{.mark}, coddled, recognised"
(Ibid.:125), [leading to an "obsession with becoming 'other']{.mark}"
(Ibid.:129). Baudrillard even asserts that [the increase of information
in our]{.mark} media-saturated [society results in a loss of
meaning]{.mark} because it "exhausts itself in the act of staging
communication" (Baudrillard, 1994:80). [New]{.mark} media [technologies
exacerbate the subject's fantasy of true communication]{.mark}, while
increasingly what are communicated are mere copies of the same, a
'recycling in the negative of the traditional institution' (Ibid.:80).
The "lure" (Ibid.:81) of such a system resides in its requirement of
active political dissent. This translates in a call to "subjectivize"
oneself -- to be vocal, be active, to speak, participate, disagree, and
"play the ... liberating claim of subjecthood" (Ibid.:85). But [radical
alterity]{.mark} -- that what or those who cannot be assimilated into
this logic of humanism and capitalism -- [is]{.mark} in turn [gradually
exterminated]{.mark}.]{.underline} What therefore needs to be uncovered
is how "difference qua illusion" (Ibid.:131) perpetuates the current
logic of capitalism and its problematic reproduction of racism and
sexism. Like Grace (2000) I believe that [Baudrillard's insistence on
[this]{.mark} major [moment in capitalism is of great importance to
feminist politics]{.mark}, and not sexist or nihilist as many feminists
have made his analysis out to be. In fact, [Baudrillard's critique on
the feminist compulsion to see]{.mark} (the subject of) empowerment,
alliance and [liberation as univocally positive is imperative for
understanding how Western feminism can]{.mark} better [address its
complicity in exploitation]{.mark}. In this sense, Baudrillard simply
brings the feminist insistence on dissecting the relationship between
patriarchy, racism, technologies and capitalism to its logical
conclusion.]{.underline} This analysis has also been present in some
feminist critiques of alliance and desire. For instance Spivak (1993)
discusses how the fantasy of the subject-agent as the centre for
evolution and action, relies on the reproduction of marginality. She
implies that subjugation is exercised as a discursive and technological
form of imperialist violence. Any claim to authentic marginality becomes
a commitment to this imperialist subjugation. [[Feminisms that rely on
the idea of the empirical reality]{.mark} that these margins provide,
profess to the belief system -- humanism and capitalism -- [that assigns
this marginality]{.mark}. The ones who can empower themselves through
this claim for marginality become agents of this logic, since they are a
"group susceptible to upward mobility" that function as "authentic
inhabitants of the margin" (Spivak, 1990:59).]{.underline} They
seemingly prove the universal applicability of the humanist subject and
its technologies. Spivak therefore exclaims that all this involves "the
creation of a general will for post-industrial finance capitalism ...
It's a very different tactic than industrial capitalism" (2002:179). It
is exactly this "very different tactic" that Baudrillard's work helps us
to understand in much more detail. Nearly all feminist engagements with
Baudrillard have stopped short of following through the implications of
his thought for a politics based on the humanist idea of subjective
empowerment. Many feminists have been suspicious of the emergence of a
critique of the subject at the very moment when women finally start to
succeed in claiming subjectivity and decentre masculinity from its
conceptualisation. Braidotti for instance states that 'the high priests
of postmodernism \[may\] preach the deconstruction ... of the subject
... truth of the matter is: one cannot deconstruct a subjectivity one
has never been fully granted' (1994:140-141). While this makes sense in
terms of its critique on male philosophers problematically hallucinating
the feminine as a site of redemption, I would nonetheless like to turn
Braidotti's remark on its head by asking if her insistence on attaining
subject-status is perhaps itself a corollary of an intensifying
neoliberal demand. Subject-centred politics and difference -- like
perhaps especially the enactment in conferences and articles of the
difference in opinion regarding the subject between Braidotti and Butler
-- have become exponents of capitalist consumption. Feminist politics of
the subject possibly have themselves developed into a simulation of
politics that reinforces the neoliberal status quo. In light of this, it
is not surprising that the dominant version of 'the' history of feminism
starts with the first wave of claims for individual rights and equality,
at a moment when industrial capitalism and its mechanical logic of
reproduction emerged. This feminist claim and its later development in
the second wave was then arguably not one that proved the next stage of
Western humanist 'progress,' but was instead the result of a sort of
command which trickily assigned to 'women' the semiotic status of being
the relative other of 'men.' [[Nostalgia for these feminist
waves]{.mark} in turn [hallucinates an authentically progressive
feminism in Europe's history where there was foremost a complicity in
the oppression and extermination of]{.mark} incommensurable forms of
[radical (female) alterit]{.mark}y, at 'home' as well as abroad. Such
feminist nostalgia for an imaginary lost origin indeed grounds a racist
and classist narrative of feminist liberation as uncomplicated. We can
see this logic even at work in Nancy Fraser's indictment of second wave
feminism as implicated in a new form of capitalism. While I agree with
Fraser that there is a "disturbing convergence of \[feminism's\] ideals
with the demands of an emerging new form of capitalism", she nonetheless
narrates the origins of feminism as residing outside any logic of
domination (2009:1).]{.underline} For Fraser then, it becomes a question
of "reactivating ... \[and\] recovering feminism's emancipatory promise"
(Ibid.:1-2) against the "new spirit of neo-liberalism" (Ibid.:7). I
suggest instead that feminism's current problem runs much deeper[.
Despite Fraser's excellent analysis of the inefficacy of a cultural
politics that "claims for recognition over claims for redistribution"
(Ibid.:8), her attempt at feminism's recuperation through "promising new
form\[s\] of activism" and empowerment, like "utilizing communications
technologies to establish transnational networks" (Ibid.) is precisely
the kind of techno-salvation that the nostalgia for earlier feminism
engenders. In fact, the element that Fraser ignores as a possible
problematic moment in feminism is where it must "transform those
positioned as passive objects of welfare ... into active subjects"
(Ibid.: 5, my italics). [This is not to say that empowerment is
unimportant, but to claim that its politics has become increasingly
entangled with neoliberal structures of oppression]{.mark} -- hence the
sense of desperation at the Gender Conference.]{.underline}

[[Feminist]{.mark} theory, discourse, [action is infinitely
diverse,]{.mark} traversed as it is [by a multiplicity of
positions]{.mark} [and trajectories within constructs]{.mark} and
experiences [of identifications]{.mark} with numerous sources of
'difference', generally figured in terms of 'politics' in some form. The
examples of [contemporary western feminist theories of gender,]{.mark}
or sexual difference, I have considered [in relation to]{.mark} the
challenges raised by [Baudrillard have shown a tendency for these
theories to pivot on combinations of concerns including the importance
of the 'female subject', 'women's identity', 'women's desire/feminine
desire']{.mark}, the 'nomadic subject', the multiplicities of 'desiring
subjects', the notion of gender as 'performative', [the
intersection]{.mark} (and inextricability) [of 'gender' with 'other'
sources of 'difference']{.mark} (race, culture, class, sexuality, and so
on).]{.underline} [[Where there is a concern to subvert identity, all
the tropes of the productive]{.mark}, of positivity in Baudrillard's
terms, [remain firmly in place: 'power' understood as 'productive'; the
'real' is produced and these productions are]{.mark} contested and
resignified, [re-produced]{.mark}; identity as self-same reappears in
the guise of plurality, becoming, multiple subjects with no objects,
nomadic and fluid]{.underline}. These concerns and foci of analysis and
deconstruction are undeniably driven by an assumption of the
inevitability of the economic (needs, production, value), the
inevitability of the law (the bar that structures identity/ difference,
subject/ object), even taking into account the attempts at
deconstruction and rewriting from a position of a different
'difference', and of the inevitability of power. There is no seduction
here[. [These theories]{.mark} unilaterally [fail to engage the
historically and culturally specific interweaving of]{.mark} the
construct of the [economic and the structure of representation
which]{.mark}, in Baudrillard's analysis, [figures our
ontological]{.mark} [assumptions]{.mark}. Donna [Haraway]{.mark} is a
feminist theorist who departs from the constraints of some of the
epistemological and ontological presuppositions critiqued by
Baudrillard. Her '[Manifesto for cyborgs']{.mark} (in Haraway 1991)
[shows a determination]{.mark}, like Baudrillard's, [to develop an
analysis]{.mark} that is [grounded]{.mark} culturally and
[historically]{.mark}.]{.underline} There are evident in Haraway's work
none of the universal questions or constructs that tend to creep into
the works of those other feminist theorists discussed, in spite of their
claims to support what Haraway has called 'situated knowledges'.
Nevertheless, Vicki Kirby (1997) takes Haraway to task for instituting
the 'specific' as the binary opposite of the 'universal', a move Kirby
questions as one potentially reinstalling 'the cogito as the subject who
only speaks for him or herself' (1997: 161). Kirby's interest in an
ontology and epistemology that deconstruct this binary and rethink the
question of 'position' in relation to the speaking subject is important.
Haraway (1991) proposes the figure of the irreverent cyborg, a 'creature
in a post-gender world', with whom she tracks a critical understanding
of key facets structuring a world that is also postmodern. The breaching
of the boundaries constructing the human is central to her inquiry. But
these are boundaries that are still 'transgressed' (in accordance with
the law). Haraway is concerned at what she views as the need to 'resist
world-wide intensification of domination that has never been so acute'
(1991: 154). [[This domination functions according to dynamics that are
different from those confronted by a socialist feminism]{.mark} of an
earlier era; the question of 'political struggle' remains, however,
itself unquestioned by Haraway. A reading of [Baudrillard throws the
whole notion of the 'political',]{.mark} contemporarily, [into
question]{.mark}. Haraway's cyborg manifesto recognises both the dangers
(the grid of control) and the possibilities (ways out of the 'maze of
dualisms') of the 'New World Order'. [Haraway develops a critical
theorising on the]{.mark} situated decline in influence and potency of
myths of origin ([post-gender]{.mark}, a world without gender, without
genesis, without end), of totalising epistemologies, of politics defined
through immobile identities, of discourses both of unity and of
contradiction. She proposes a schema of categories to distinguish the
transition from what she describes as 'the comfortable old hierarchical
dominations' to the 'scary new networks' which she calls 'the
informatics of domination' (1991: 161). This chart of dual categories
reflects, in idealised form, a listing characterising what we have moved
from (on the left side) and what we have moved to (on the right).
Haraway has no reference to Baudrillard in this work apart from the sole
point of a definition of 'simulacra', yet [her portrayal of contemporary
social dynamics,]{.mark} and more specifically her chart, have
significant [resonances with Baudrillard's analyses of
hyper-reality]{.mark} and simulation. Indeed, at the top of Haraway's
list is 'representation' replaced by 'simulation', although the shift
remains untheorised.]{.underline} The informatics of domination marks a
world where: communications sciences and modern biologies are
constructed by a common move -- the translation of the world into a
problem of coding, a search for a common language in which all
resistance to instrumental control disappears and all heterogeneity can
be submitted to disassembly, reassembly, investment, and exchange.
(Haraway 1991: 164[) [Baudrillard's work develops a critical theorising
of]{.mark} precisely [this phenomenon]{.mark}; a theorising [that leads
to a more cautious reflection on]{.mark} the possibilities for
'poli[tical struggle', and]{.mark} possibly [a]{.mark} more
[nuanced]{.mark} questioning of the implications of a
[postgender]{.mark} world. It is noteworthy that Haraway's chart does
not include the 'political' on the left side, against which we might
suggest 'cool, ludic seduction' on the right, as a simulated politics
endlessly recast as yet another market niche. On the contrary, the
'political' appears in Haraway's essay to assume a meta-position
straddling both 'eras' (power as a universally applicable and
non-situated concept?).]{.underline}

### Sovereignty stuff 

#### The aff's realism and claims of sovereignty disseminates the world into the hyperreal -- Trump accelerated the road into the hyperreal and the plan loses the brink. That reproduces a violent reactivation of power that ends rationality.

[[The sovereignty delusion]{.mark} is by no means restricted to Brexit
as the blurring of fact and fiction, and of 2006 Richardson reality and
illusion, [has been accelerated in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[with]{.mark} the ascendency to the presidency of reality TV star,
Donald [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} (for examples beyond Brexit, see Dunn
2010; Backman 2011; Cocks 2014; Juss 2017). [[In]{.mark} our age of [the
hyperreal, Trump has been called a]{.mark} "[sovereign father]{.mark}"
for our times (Connelly 2016), a leader [who has risen on the tide of a
sovereignty myth.]{.mark} It was a myth outlined by Trump at some length
during his maiden speech to the United Nations General Assembly in
September 2017 in which sovereignty dominated and defined his address,
with the words sovereign and sovereignty mentioned twenty-one times
(Tatar 2017). In the speech, [Trump]{.mark} repeatedly [equated
sovereignty with global harmony]{.mark}, declaring, "Our success depends
on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their
sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity, and peace, for themselves
and for the world" (Haldevang 2017). He declared that "[strong,
sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish]{.mark} in the fullness
of the life intended by God" (Miller 2018) and talked of a "great
reawakening of nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride,
their people, and their patriotism.]{.underline}" That this has
historically not been a recipe for "harmony and friendship" went unnoted
in the speech (Chhabra 2017). In the Washington Post, Jaffe and DeYoung
(2017) suggested that in his appearance at the United Nations,
[[Trump]{.mark} had "[cast his presidency as]{.mark} an avatar of
[international renewal]{.mark}," a catalyst for [a renewed patriotic
spirit]{.mark}, national self-interest [and cooperation]{.mark} among
sovereign nations, which [are posited as the solution for all
international ills.]{.mark} Trump asked in his speech, "Are we still
patriots? Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and
take ownership of their future?"]{.underline} He also invoked
sovereignty to attack the "mammoth multinational trade deals" that have
supposedly empowered faceless global bureaucracies over nation-states,
sent factory jobs overseas, and hollowed out the middle class (Jaffe and
De Young 2017). [[Trump railed against]{.mark} the "unaccountable
international tribunals and powerful [global bureaucracies]{.mark}"
[that sap]{.mark} the [sovereignty]{.mark} of nations (Jaffe and De
Young 2017) and as a counter offered a passionate and populist defense
of the principles of [sovereignty and patriotism]{.mark}, which in his
words [could spark a "rebirth of devotion]{.mark}" across the
world]{.underline} (Jaffe and De Young 2017). It is a devotion to a
sovereign idyll and illusion through a missionary zeal anchored in the
ether of hyperreality. As Nasr pointed out, Trump's definition of
sovereignty in the speech is derived "from a very narrow domestic prism"
(cited in Landler 2017) out of which the United States emerges as the
first among equals. [[It is a foreign policy doctrine]{.mark} that has
been interpreted by some as [the fusion of sovereigntism with]{.mark} "a
style of big-power [nationalism]{.mark}" and, in an echo of earlier
presidencies, one that has been labeled by the president and his
advisors as "[principled realism]{.mark}" and "America first" (Bierman
and Lauter 2017). For Patrick (2017a) it [represents an invocation of
sovereignty to "assert universal truths]{.mark} and to deflect messy
realities." Patrick suggested that Trump's speech should be seen as part
of a broader "sovereigntist" critique of the global order]{.underline},
which has been evident in policy stances from leaving the Paris Climate
Agreement, to renouncing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the
criticism of alliances like NATO, through to threats to ignore the World
Trade Organization, and moratoriums on any new multilateral treaties
(Patrick 2017b[). It is in Trump's sovereigntist agenda that [we glimpse
a mourning for the waning of U.S. heg]{.mark}emony in the face of "messy
realities," a lament for the absence of power, which "for some time now
produces nothing but signs of its resemblance ...; an obsession with its
death; an obsession with its survival which becomes greater the more it
disappears"]{.underline} (Baudrillard \[1981\] 1988, 180[). Baudrillard
(\[1981\] 1988) wrote of a "\[m\]elancholy for societies without power,"
whereby "power is no longer present except to conceal that there is
none" (180--81). [It is out of this melancholy for power]{.mark}, and a
rage against its loss, that [the sovereigntist agenda can materialize in
ever more disturbing ways]{.mark}]{.underline}. One such moment occurred
on 4 April 2018, with the release of a memo by Trump titled, "Securing
the Southern Border of the United States," in which National Guard
troops were ordered to the U.S.--Mexico border in response to a
"caravan" of refugees traveling to the United States from Central
America (Jacobs 2018). The first paragraph sets the scene of a
sovereignty principle in crisis: 1) The security of the United States is
imperiled by a drastic surge of illegal activity on the southern border.
Large quantities of fentanyl, other opioids, and other dangerous and
illicit drugs are flowing across our southern border and into our
country at unprecedented levels, destroying the lives of our families
and loved ones. ... Deadly transnational gangs are systematically
exploiting Sovereignty, the Hyperreal, and "Taking Back Control" 2007
our unsecured southern border to enter our country and develop
operational capacity in American communities throughout the country. The
anticipated rapid rise in illegal crossings as we head into the spring
and summer months threatens to overwhelm our Nation's law enforcement
capacities. (Trump 2018, italics added) The memo stresses a border
regime where the ability to ensure the sovereignty of the nation is in
doubt (see Miller \[2018\] on Trump's preference for the term nation),
with it suggesting that "our American way of life hinges on our ability
as a Nation to adequately and effectively enforce our laws and protect
our borders. A key and undeniable attribute of a sovereign nation is the
ability to control who and what enters its territory" (Trump 2018).
Throughout the memo a sovereignty principle in crisis is invoked, with
paragraphs 4 and 5 warning, "The lawlessness that continues at our
southern border is fundamentally incompatible with the safety, security,
and sovereignty of the American people. ... the highest sovereign duty
of the President is to defend this Nation, which includes the defense of
our borders" (Trump 2018). The memo's unsubtle generation of an
existential threat to "our American way of life" works to regenerate the
sovereign nation; it strives to revive a moribund "moral and political
principle ... in distress" (Baudrillard \[1981\] 1988, 172--73). [[From
it emerges a pure and perfect U.S. sovereignty that contrasts
with]{.mark} the [disorder]{.mark} and chaos beyond, "[a simulated
real]{.mark}, which henceforth supplants the real and is its final
solution, [a virtual universe from which everything dangerous]{.mark}
and negative has been [expelled]{.mark}" (Baudrillard
2004).]{.underline} To maintain the illusion of sovereign perfection, in
June 2018 children of asylum seekers were separated from their parents
at the U.S. border, as Trump declared, "The United States will not be a
migrant camp ... You look at what's happening in other places---we can't
allow that to happen to the United States. Not on my watch" (Gambino and
Lartey 2018). In the simulated sovereignty of Trump's America First, the
"circulation of hyperreal signs of his ability and often his ability
alone ... deliver what he defines as truly in the US national interest"
(Weber 2017, S-137, italics added; on Trump scripting himself as the
superhero, see Dittmer 2018). [In one sense, [Trump is a continuation of
U.S. presidents since]{.mark} Ronald [Reagan]{.mark} [who have]{.mark}
each [told us "a meta-theoretical story about Baudrillardian sign
theory]{.mark} where presidents ... mark different moments of the
simulacrum" (Rubenstein 2008, 11). For example, on George W. Bush's
presidency, Suskind (2004) outlined a faith-based administration with a
disdain for "the reality-based community." A senior advisor to Bush at
the time, stated to Suskind: "[We're an empire now, and when we act, we
create our own reality.]{.mark} And while you're studying that
reality---judiciously, as you will---we'll act again, creating other new
realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort
out." Suskind described a presidency of "unflinching confidence \[that\]
has an almost mystical power. It can all but create reality." 3 [Trump
is also a continuation and confirmation of the practice of "statecraft
as mancraft]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Weber 2016, 4; see also Ashley 1989),
[whereby [the sovereign foundation of the modern state is presented as a
"phantastical yet presumed-to-be-factual 'sovereign man]{.mark}'---as if
it were the singular, preexisting, ahistorical ground that authorizes
all sovereign decisions in its political community"]{.underline} (Weber
2016, 4--5). Applied to our own phantastical times, Trump as sovereign
man could claim on 5 April 2018---without any corroborating
evidence---that in the caravan of refugees "women are raped at levels
that nobody has ever seen before" (cited in Z. B. Wolf 2018). Then, in
October 2018, as a group of mainly Honduran asylum seekers moved through
Mexico toward the U.S. border, Trump called it an "onslaught of illegal
aliens" (Darrah 2018). On 31 October he tweeted, "We will NOT let these
Caravans, which are also made up of some very bad thugs and gang
members, into the U.S. Our Border is sacred" (Evans 2018). In a speech
at the White House on the same day, Trump added that if "they want to
throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. I told them to
consider it a rifle" (Weaver and Manson 2018). In such hypermasculine
declarations and denunciations, a state of crisis and threat becomes the
norm---a form of "banal geopolitics," whereby crises and extreme remedy
become "nothing out of the ordinary," "routine," "normal,
taken-for-granted geopolitics" (Sidaway 2001, 606--7). [These episodes
also recall [Brown's interpretation of border walls]{.mark} and their
paraphernalia and performance "[as symbolic and semiotic responses to
crises]{.mark}" (R. Jones et al. 2017, 2). For against Trump's refrain
that "a secure border is a sovereign right"]{.underline} (Swoyer 2016),
Anderson (2018) noted in The San Diego UnionTribune that the immense
efforts at securitizing the U.S.--Mexico border have had the
counterfunction of 2008 Richardson jeopardizing U.S. sovereignty and
human security as "\[s\]trong, militarized enforcement has resulted in a
stronger militarized response by well-financed drug cartels and
increased corruption, violence and death, but not a decrease in the flow
of drugs." Extreme violence and discipline were anticipated by
Baudrillard (\[1981\] 1988), who noted that power threatened by
simulation "risks the real, risks crisis, it gambles on remanufacturing
artificial, social, economic, political stakes. This is a question of
life or death for it" (180). It also becomes a question of life and
death for those caught in the "collective demand for signs of power---a
holy union which forms around the disappearance of power" (180). In the
desert of "Making America Great Again" are the drowned of the Rio Grande
and the missing of the arid U.S.--Mexico borderlands---victims of a
melancholy for a society without power. While hyperreality's scenario of
power conceals the fact that the real power has disappeared (Baudrillard
\[1981\] 1988), simulation does not exclude the violent
counterconvulsions of a sovereign tormented by the ebb of its power. As
Baudrillard (1983) insisted, the simulacrum of war does not make it "any
less heinous for being a mere simulacrum---the flesh suffers just the
same, and the dead ex-combatants count as much there as in other wars"
(70, cited in Merrin 1994, 444). A condition of the hyperreal makes
possible absolute sovereign authority and with it the full realization
of sovereignty's devastating foundational logic---the operation of a
binary of those who are protected and those who could legitimately die
(Agamben 1998). [For Weber (2017), [the Trump "campaign]{.mark} and
presidency [are part]{.mark} and parcel [of]{.mark} earlier [historical
'experiments'---in white, Western, heteropatriarchal authoritarian
leadership, in neoliberalism]{.mark} and the specific modalities of
citizenship, governance and reason" (S-134; see also Adorno et al. 1950;
Brown 2003; Bauman 2016; Connelly 2016). Weber saw [Trump's simulated
form as president]{.mark} as akin to Badiou's (2001) description of the
function of the simulacrum under Nazism: in which a hyperreal national
[allegiance to the selfreferential simulacrum as heteropatriarchal
leader piles specific fictions upon fictions]{.mark}. It does so not
only to mask ... the absence of the reality principle but to generate a
dangerous, materializable, national fantasy that depends upon
particularizing, identifying and regulating abstract allies and
enemies]{.underline}. (74; see also Weber 2017, S-135) For Weber, Trump
"opposes the 'righteous' to the 'unrighteous', who he variously named
during the campaign as all or many of 'the blacks', 'the gays', 'the
Mexican rapists' and the 'radical Islamic terrorists'" (Weber 2017,
S-136). In her polemic, Weber highlighted how simulation and
dissimulation "re-code sovereignty ... in the name of that particular
abstract set of sovereign US subjects on whose behalf the administration
(pretends to) claim(s) its authority to rule---'righteous Americans'"
(Weber 2017, S-138). In a haze of "fake news" and "alternative facts"
(which are read by some as "real news") the administration's strategy is
one "that attempts to overwhelm US democracy with ... representations,
simulations and dissimulations of facts and fictions, so all that
remains intact is the authority of Trump and Trump as our authoritarian
leader" (Weber 2017, S-137--39). [[These hyperreal simulations and
dissimulations of sovereignty are far from intangible]{.mark}, unreal,
or benign [but]{.mark} effectively [maintain violent exclusionary
hierarchies]{.mark} through privileging "righteous Americans" and the
elevation of "a particular people and its mode of life above those
marked as alien" (Cocks 2014, 3; Weber 2017, 136). [It is out of the
sovereignty of the hyperreal that there emerge new terrains and]{.mark}
[possibilities for the "violent reactivation of a form of power that
despairs of its rational foundations]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark}
(Baudrillard 1980, 110, cited in Kroker 1984, 58).

### [Link -- A5/transparency]{.underline}

#### [Clarifying article 5 reaffirms the newfound project of hegemonic visibility -- that reifies operational warfare. 2 impacts -- (i): a new form of control through warfare, and (ii): manufacturing the deaths and violence the aff seeks to prevent.]{.underline} 

Dan **Öberg** (**2016**) War, transparency and control: the military
architecture of operational warfare, Cambridge Review of International
Affairs, 29:3, 1132-1149,

[In this article I have argued for the need to examine the way [warfare
exerts control through discourses of transparency]{.mark}. In so doing I
draw upon the insistence that [we live in an era of 'hegemonic
visibility']{.mark} (Baudrillard 2014, 11) in which [global wars are
fought to extend a 'matchless transparency']{.mark} (Virilio 2000b, 23)
to the world. To analyse this, I have investigated military doctrines so
as to illustrate how [they render a mental and visual space and time of
warfare visible through operational coding]{.mark}. I argue that [this
logic creates a military architecture characterized by]{.mark} an excess
of Kafkaesque [bureaucratic]{.mark} and organizational [procedures in
which warfare becomes a derivate of planning and modelling]{.mark}. At
the end point of this logic we find a Weltanschauung characterized by US
military operations conducted in 'an operational environment that is
ever expanding']{.underline} (AFDD 2007b, 1) where future threats are
preemptively erased in real time. Such "transparent warfare" is closely
connected to the "liberal way of war" as it helps to manage and mobilize
visual regimes employed in and through warfare. [One important point
outlined in this article is the way the [military architecture relies on
an operational]{.mark} violence which cuts through political space and
time and invests it as calculable, decipherable and foreseeable. [The
"hegemonic visibility"]{.mark} that Baudrillard has drawn our attention
to [is]{.mark} therefore [an inherent part of the way the military
architecture renders itself]{.mark}, the global battlefield and future
political subjectivity transparent, and i[n doing so it helps to affirm
a liberal way of life]{.mark}]{.underline}. Dillon and Reid have
convincingly argued that the centre of gravity of the liberal way of war
is the future itself (2009, 148). But while Dillon and Reid claim such
policing centres around biopolitical stakes (particularly the
discrimination of which life is worth living and which isn't), I would
argue that liberal control is also waged through the way it renders the
future image of global time and space visible through operational
coding. Henceforth, [[the targeting]{.mark} and erasure [of future
political subjectivity through]{.mark} [hegemonic visibility play
a]{.mark}n important [part in the way global liberal governance
functions]{.mark}. Arguably, [the most important impact]{.mark} of this
technique [is the way operational violence indicates a type of governing
which aims to reduce space]{.mark}/time [to]{.mark} a [derivate]{.mark}
of [global warfare]{.mark} and cut it from its political potential. The
form and the content of the military architecture---[its excess of
info]{.mark}rmation [coupled with the urgency to render the world
transparent and control it---come together as an attempt to conduct a
violent futurology]{.mark} [which]{.mark} [attempts]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
exhaust and [govern the present]{.mark}.]{.underline} We are now in a
position to better respond to the conundrum in the introduction of this
article---that both the proponents of and those who challenge warfare
invoke the need for increased transparency of the battlefield. [[Those
who wish to]{.mark} see and [construct the future battlefield rely on
the details of its imagery in order to kill.]{.mark} Likewise,
[those]{.mark} [who want to]{.mark} prevent or [illustrate the unlawful
nature of such attacks rely on virtual reproduction in order to]{.mark}
know and [prove that the attacks took place]{.mark}. However, if our
contemporary world is understood to be enmeshed in an ideology of
excessive visibility, the commonsensical answer "[more transparency"
becomes part of the problem]{.mark} rather than a solution]{.underline}.
If seen accordingly, better visibility does not change the fact that
control is exerted through the production of a constant demand for
transparency that in turn masks the way the military architecture is
founded on and enacts control through this very demand. As Chamayou has
illustrated by quoting interviews with mutilated victims from drone
attacks: When you ask Sadaullah, or Karim, or S. Hussein and others like
them what they want, they do not say 'transparency and accountability'.
[[They say they want the killing to stop]{.mark}. They want to stop
dying. They want to stop going to funerals---and being bombed even as
they mourn. [Transparency and accountability]{.mark}, for them, [are
abstract problems that have little to do with the concrete fact of
regular, systematic death]{.mark}.]{.underline} (Chamayou 2015b, 149)
[Chamayou is no doubt correct in that more transparency is of little
help to the victims of drone violence. However, as I have tried to
illustrate in this article, [it is not only the actual killings on the
global battlefield but the way an ideology of transparency underlies the
military supporting system which unveils warfare as a modelling]{.mark}
and operationalization [of]{.mark} administrative [routines]{.mark}
[which manufacture such killings]{.mark}.]{.underline} If one is to
challenge the way drones kill, one needs to understand the supporting
system which creates a demand for the killing mechanisms. [[Every
military]{.mark} "telecommuting office [worker]{.mark}/hunter[" is
refracted in relation to an architecture that provides]{.mark} and
manufactures [an excess of visibility, invisible limits,]{.mark}
illusions of choice, erasures [and blind spots.]{.mark} [This]{.mark}
architecture [creates a demand for a particular type of violence]{.mark}
as it helps to unveil a world which is transparent, open-access,
logical, measurable and always connected to the operational. This is not
to say that operational warfare always works, or that the demand is
always there. It is simply to say that [operational warfare aims to keep
the potential for violent techniques of control in place by unveiling
itself as a]{.mark} particular [kind of]{.mark} organizational
[routine]{.mark}. How would one challenge "transparent
warfare"?]{.underline} If there is a "Baudrillardian" wager in relation
to critiquing warfare as a means for control, it would arguably be that
one needs to do so without reifying the value of transparency. Instead
one should aim to 'potentiate what is new, original, unexpected'
(Baudrillard 1990b, 148) in the military architecture itself. [This
article has strived to look for the [potentially new]{.mark} in
[operational warfare]{.mark}, so as to tease out the politics of the
processing and modelling of warfare. [The challenge to "post-heroic" war
consists in investigating the various logics of and consequences
transparency has as a means for control.]{.mark} The novelty of this
relation resides in the way warfare is not, as many tend to argue, first
and foremost about a response to practical problems when conducting
military operations.]{.underline} Rather, it is characterized by the
potential to violently unveil global space (as an area of operations)
and global time (as a battle rhythm) to maintain and control political
becoming. It remains to be seen if it is possible to create hidden
spaces and times, uncoded by operational warfare (see also Baudrillard
2014, 10), that are not conditioned by the hegemonic visibility of
military architectures. In my view, to investigate and affirm such a
project is a timely and important task for a future critical war
studies.

### Link -- US influence/imperialism

#### An expanded US influence expands the US' nation brand -- the K is key to explore the impacts of relationships that arrive as a result of the transition of governance into the simulacra. 

**Kaneva**, Nadia. "Simulation Nations: Nation Brands and Baudrillard's
Theory of Media." European Journal of Cultural Studies, vol. 21, no. 5,
London, England: SAGE Publications, pp. 631--48,

I have argued that [[Baudrillard's assault on the real,]{.mark} as he
theorizes media-saturated consumer societies, [contains a radical
potential for the analysis of nation brands]{.mark}. His notion of
[hyperreality points to the erasure of distinctions between the nation
and its simulations]{.mark}. As the signs of nation brands circulate
through media networks, they encounter other media signs, all of which
intertwine in the play of appearances and seek to seduce media
audiences.]{.underline} At the same time, what differentiates
promotional simulacra, including nation brands, from other media signs
is the overtly programmatic, strategic nature of promotional messages
which, by definition, aim to alter perceptions. In that sense, [[nation
brands have become integral to what Baudrillard calls 'strategies of the
real']{.mark} in contemporary media cultures.]{.underline} This is the
Janus-faced nature of nation brands as simulacra -- they claim to
simultaneously reflect and alter the reality of the nation.
[Baudrillard's theory of hyperreality offers one way to explain how this
seemingly impossible feat is made to look real. Furthermore,
[Baudrillard]{.mark} (2001) describes [a 'precession of simulacra',
whereby non-referential models are used to manufacture simulations that
stand in for the real.]{.mark} Based on this argument, the 'core idea'
of a nation-branding campaign -- derived through an obligatory
distillation process (Aronczyk, 2013) -- serves as the model that
precedes the simulation nation that is conjured up through
media.]{.underline} This process was clearly at play in Kosovo's
branding, in Ruslana's Eurovision act and in numerous other
nation-branding exercises. Among other things, this means that [[the
simulation nation is not bound by historical fact]{.mark}, although
simulacra of history and antiquity abound in its media
manifestations]{.underline}. Rather, the simulation nation is created de
novo each time it appears in the flickering lights of media screens only
to disappear once again as the lights go out. But if there is no way to
tell apart the real from the simulated, what can be the basis of
critical inquiry into the workings of nation brands and media? How can
research peer through the play of appearances and what could be its
task? In my view, Baudrillard's theoretical excursions are of limited
help as we tackle these questions because they have little to say about
the material aspects of media industries or institutions. Although his
critical project starts as a revision of Marx's critique of political
economy, his later work abandons a focus on materiality and focuses
instead on 'the image form' that emanates from the media, that is, the
simulacrum (Merrin, 2005: 155)[. However, more than simulacra machines,
the media exist as material networks of circulation, as technological
systems, as profit-driven industries and as professional and cultural
institutions, governed by economic, political and technological
logics.]{.underline} That is where critical inquiry can continue to
intervene and for that we need to look beyond Baudrillard. One source of
inspiration can come from Marxist critiques of commercial brands as
technologies for the creation of capital (e.g. Arvidsson, 2005). Drawing
on Baudrillard, global media brands such as Apple, Google and Facebook
can be seen as pure simulacra. Yet, beyond their hyperreal properties,
these brands have also generated tremendous amounts of capital,
expropriating human desires for sociality. [[What]{.mark}, if anything[,
is different about nation brands in comparison to commercial
brands?]{.mark} What kinds of profits do they generate, in what ways and
to whom do these profits accrue?]{.underline} Andrew Wernick's
conceptualization of the commodity-sign as an object with a dual purpose
can be particularly helpful as we seek to move beyond Baudrillard but to
retain the value of his critique. Following Wernick, [[nation brands
are]{.mark} revealed to be [more than clusters of promotional signs but
also 'objects-to-be-sold']{.mark}, that is, [they are]{.mark} units of
[media content]{.mark} that are [created to generate profit]{.mark}
within a system of market exchange. Although they are typically produced
with public funds, nation brands as commodity-signs generate profits
primarily for private media companies and for promotional
outfits]{.underline} (Kaneva, 2015). The justifications for and
consequences of this transference of wealth need further analysis.
Furthermore, the logic of commodity-signs is not limited to promotional
messages but applies to other media content as well. This is illustrated
by the fact that some transnational media corporations today have
special sales and production teams who approach national governments
with 'package' offers that include country-specific news content paired
with promotional videos, both of which are created by the media
organization (Bolin and Ståhlberg, 2015). [[Media practices that blur
the lines]{.mark} between editorial and promotional content have [been
examined in relation to consumer brand]{.mark}s]{.underline} (e.g.
Einstein, 2016). [However, [the impact of such trends on politics and
governance needs further exploration]{.mark}. [One]{.mark} [example of
possible implications can be seen]{.mark} in the recent proliferation of
'[fake news']{.mark} -- fabricated content, the whose main goal of which
is to generate maximum attention and, therefore, maximum profit.
[Despite its 'unreality', such content has been linked to shifts in
political]{.mark} opinions and [decisions,]{.mark} but the scope of this
influence is still poorly understood]{.underline}. A related line of
research would entail mapping the ways in which commodity-signs enter
and move through the circulatory streams of global media networks. Some
interesting work on this topic already exists (e.g. Valaskivi and
Sumiala, 2014), but much remains to be done. A focus on circulation
needs to acknowledge that promotion transcends the boundaries of
'campaigns' and infiltrates all forms of media that are not identifiable
as 'advertising' (e.g. Aronczyk and Powers, 2010; Wernick, 1991).
Exposing the industrial and technological protocols of media
corporations would shed new light on the ways in which capital is
enmeshed in the processes of assembling or dispersing national and
transnational publics[. [These processes have important consequences for
political mobilization,]{.mark} for the symbolic production of
nationhood and for the construction of shared social realities more
broadly]{.underline}. The lines of inquiry I have outlined above are far
from exhaustive and are limited by their particular focus on media.
[[The]{.mark} [materiality of nationhood]{.mark} -- how it is
experienced by individuals on a daily basis, how it is enacted in
institutional and policy contexts and how it intersects with simulations
of the nation -- [is]{.mark} [worthy of its own
exploration,]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}but that is a task for
another study. At the conclusion of this theoretical exploration, we
should be wary of making totalizing claims about the triumph of
hyperreality. Nevertheless, we should retain at least one insight from
Baudrillard, namely, that simulation functions 'not only as a mode of
communication but also as a mode of social control' (Merrin, 2005: 24).
Despite his self-professed nihilism, [Baudrillard never abandoned the
goals of social critique and transformation and therein lies the main
value of his work.]{.underline}

[[The post-structuralist approach]{.mark}, in so far as a coherent
approach exists, [sees]{.mark} the discipline of [IR as part of a wider
movement in social thought]{.mark}, emphasises the necessity of an
interdisciplinary methodology, and seeks to \'unsettle established
categories and disconcert the reader\']{.underline}.4 The theory derives
much of its inspiration from Michel Foucault, who argued that power and
knowledge are intimately linked, with one implying the other. Using the
example of the prison system, Foucault suggested that a generic set of
assumptions, derived from particular societal power relations, can be
identified as underpinning all aspects of society.[5 [A]{.mark} dominant
discourse or a [\'regime of truth\' is held to impose critical limits
upon our ability to think politically about particular problems]{.mark}

to do something \[is]{.mark} presented\] as
[evident\']{.mark}]{.underline}.8 popular portrayal of intra-state
crises and domestic political disorder lacks political analysis and
facilitates the idea that the solution can only be found in externally
co-ordinated administrative, as opposed to political, action. The
discourse presupposes a distinction between \'we\' and \'they\' which
narrows the The debate to a focus on \'whether and how \"we\" should
help \"them\"\'.9 [[The assumption - inherent in the discourse
on]{.mark} intervention and [statebuilding]{.mark} - [that external

considered to be [false]{.mark} [given the]{.mark} often [casual

apparent in the rhetoric surrounding th threat posed by \'failed

suggested that the US was threatened more than by aggressive states and
this heralded the emergence of emphasis on the ostensibly causal link
between intra-state colla proliferation of various forms of criminality,
instability and, i global terrorism. The Commission on Weak States and
US Nation provides an indicative statement of this hypothesis: Weak and
failed governments generate instability, which harms the drags down
their neighbors and ultimately threatens US interests in effective
international system, providing the foundation for continuity, and, not
least, protecting Americans from external threats to ou According to
this perspective the threat menacing Western soc from sub-state groups

Intelligence Strategy of the United States des states as \'breeding

failed states democracy has been regularly bedrock of stability and key
to security; the USA\'s 2005 National In Strategy describes democracy
as, \'the stoutest pillar of support\' security and notes, \'the lack of
freedom in one state endangers the freedom of others . . . failed states
are a refuge and breeding extremism\'.17 [[Democracy is seen as a
panacea]{.mark} and a [key]{.mark} weapon [against terrorism]{.mark} the
spread of which - from the core to the per axiomatically good for all.18
[What constitutes a \'failed state\']{.mark}, however, [is open to

divergence is evident to whether the failure manifests as coercive or
administrative in terms of the former,]{.underline} Robert Jackson
believes a state to be failed i or will not safeguard minimum civil

to be indicative of state where the state fails to meet the needs of the
population and \'capacity gap\'.20 The definition provided by Foreign
Policy and Peace describes as \'failed\' those states that \'lack the
authoritative collective decisions or the capacity to deliver public
service countries, the populace may rely entirely on the black market
taxes, or engage in large-scale civil disobedience. The term \'failed
state\' thus refers to states manifesting two coercive incapacity and
administrative incapacity. This diversity states necessarily undermines
broad extrapolations derived from t posed by \'failed states\' and
generic threats emanating from \'fair Additionally, there is very little
evidence to support the claims states breed terrorism or are a major
threat to international stability.22 Indeed, Justin Logan and
Christopher Preble speculate the claims that failed states are

used in the global insecurity, therefore, the term is less an objective

subjective manner to aid the conceptualisation of a world divided group

therefore, \'failed states\' lacks real descriptive merit myriad

failed states but rather that the range of states which poten into this
category is so great that it is not possible to formulat towards this
amorphous group. Yet, as is evident, policy produced in the past 10
years have regularly warned of the me by \'failed states\' as though
there was a generic manifestation. The term appears, therefore, to
conform more to a desire to sim complexities of the world into a
bifurcated vision of \'good\' and \'f \'Failed state\' is thus largely a
pejorative term used to reaffirm a the core, first, that existing
dangers emanate from the periphery an that the periphery is

ills emanate]{.mark} - especially terrorism - [enables the shift of

creation of an \'other\' against which one can contrast oneself;
