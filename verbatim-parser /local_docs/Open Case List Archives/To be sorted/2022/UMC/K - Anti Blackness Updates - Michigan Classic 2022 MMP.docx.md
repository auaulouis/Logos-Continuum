IMPERIAL DEMOCRACY What ultimately undermines the Enlightenment is the
claim to the universal when its theories are based on the particular.
[Whiteness is at the heart of Enlightenment thinking and this is no
different in the supposedly radical new approaches]{.underline}. All are
fundamentally incapable of even naming the racism that is the basis of
the global political and economic system, let alone able to offer any
actual solutions. We can see this in the distorted Enlightenment
progress narratives that underpin the new utopias, but also in the
genesis and creation myths of the social movements that have informed
the theory. The [sparks that lit many of the new social movements
were]{.underline} the financial crisis in 2008, the election of Trump
and the vote for Brexit, which created, in Bregman's words, 'more and
[more people hungry for a real **radical antidote** to both xenophobia
and inequality..]{.underline}. for a new source of hope'.40 [Ground zero
in this narrative is the birth of neoliberalism]{.underline}, ushered in
by Thatcherism and Reaganomics in the eighties. Dismantling the social
democratic settlement unleashed the forces of capital and sowed the
seeds for the economic crash in 2008. The unemployment, insecurity and
austerity that followed led to the inevitable rise of the new right as
people looked for causes of their poverty. It also exposed the inherent
contradictions of capital and stoked the embers of protest by revealing
their oppression to the oppressed. One of the first and most
high-profile responses to this crisis was **[the Occupy
movement]{.underline}**, which swept the globe. On 17 September 2011,
protestors occupied Zuccotti Park in downtown Manhattan near the
financial district in order to protest at the cause of the financial
crisis. The movement grew rapidly, spreading to a thousand cities and
racking up 6,500 arrests within its first six months.41 The occupation
was prompted by the Canadian anti-capitalist magazine *Adbusters* which
'issued a call to action for a "revolution," a "people's revolt in the
West"' in response to the crisis of capitalism.42 Occupy **[took
inspiration from previous movements like the Indignados in
Spain,]{.underline}** who had occupied public space in response to
rising unemployment, austerity and other structural adjustments enforced
by external financial institutions.43 **[The Arab Spring,]{.underline}**
highlighted by the occupation of Tahrir Square in Egypt in 2011, had a
large influence on Occupy as the images of mass occupation of a public
space took hold in the imagination. Thousands occupied Zuccotti Park for
almost two months, until police raided and shut down the protest on 15
November. Occupy's reach was such that President Obama gave the movement
his approval in his 2012 re-election campaign. By focusing on the
economic crisis Occupy changed the political language and 'income
inequality' became the 'crisis du jour', something that all the 2016
presidential candidates at least had to address.44 The power of the
economic message was its simplicity. The [Occupiers declared that they
were the 99 per cent standing up to the evil 1 per cent who hoarded the
wealth. The only problem is that this idea is a delusional fantasy and a
continuation of the universalizing of the White particular that we have
seen from both left and right. **Global inequality**]{.underline} is so
stark that those on the poverty line **[in the United
States]{.underline}** are still in the top 14 per cent of earners
worldwide. The **[average US salary puts you in the top 4 per cent of
earners.]{.underline}** There is simply no comparison between the
conditions facing the poorest in the world and those who are at the
bottom in the United States, or in the rest of the West. Only by
focusing on a national analysis could the '99 per cent' rhetoric make
any sense. By looking at its demands, or at least its articulation of
the problem, it is abundantly clear that **[Occupy was focused on those
in the West, not the victims of it.]{.underline}** The [Declaration of
the Occupation of New York City]{.underline}, collectively produced by
Occupiers, [is a laundry list of national demands]{.underline} around
healthcare, jobs and student debt. The most [telling line is the
complaint that the 1 per cent 'have consistently outsourced labor and
used that outsourcing as leverage to cut workers' healthcare and pay'.45
No prizes for guessing which 'workers' they are referring to here.
Presumably, bringing back those jobs and further impoverishing the
underdeveloped world would be acceptable]{.underline} as long as the
true 'workers' had access to unskilled and well-paid work. The
declaration does include a line condemning the elite because 'they have
perpetuated colonialism at home and abroad.' But this is so vague and
contradictory to the rest of the declaration that it makes a mockery of
their plea for the 'people of the world' to join the struggle. In the
same vein as the Enlightenment thinkers, **[the centre of Occupy's world
was the West because it contained the fully formed workers, the movers
of history.]{.underline}** [Even **within the West** the movement faced
criticism for its tendency to '**exclude minority voices'46** and faced
serious issues of **misogyny**]{.underline}.47 There were also marked
**[class differences,]{.underline}** with the people who could afford to
sleep in Zuccotti Park in protest brushing up against those who had
already made it their home because of poverty. The classed differences
also spread into tactics. Occupy Seattle angered working-class dock
workers by closing down the port in protest against commercialism; their
principled stance meant the people they were supposed to be fighting
for, the 'workers', lost valuable income. [Occupy prided itself on
**democratic decision-making**]{.underline} but it was 'limited by
failures to build alliances beyond those implicit inside its inner
community'.48 **[Democracy matters very little if your electorate is
highly exclusive]{.underline}**, a lesson that the left needs
desperately to learn. It might be tempting to see [Occupy]{.underline}
as 'a global movement (inspired by the Arab Spring)', but the reality is
that it was in a long [tradition of Western social
movements]{.underline} which broke out in the United States and spread
into Europe and the rest of the world.49 [In claiming to represent the
99 per cent, Occupy, perhaps unwittingly, followed in the path of
Enlightenment universalism, speaking for the entire world through the
very narrow lens of Western privilege**.**]{.underline}

In many ways [Occupy was 'the idealist moment, the performance rather
than permanence']{.underline}.55 In Zuccotti Park, or in their hundreds
of other locations around the world, they were performing the ideal.
Occupy was performance art, a grand piece of 'utopian theatre'
**[dramatizing the other world that is otherwise out of
reach.]{.underline}**56 Here we see the White left at its most
stomach-churning. Reading through some of the misty-eyed reflections on
the movement, they have the feeling of romantic holiday diaries. Nothing
may have changed and the movement may have collapsed but no fear, we
will always have Zuccotti Park. **[Occupy's horizontal organization
involved both a deep narcissism]{.underline}**--with slogans such as 'we
are our demands'--and a way of building community that relied on 'people
forming loose connections quickly' which fit perfectly into current
times.57 [It was the swipe-right of social movements, with no deep
ideological commitments, loose connections, and the ability to find some
fun elsewhere without feeling guilty. Performance over permanence is
only an option to those in the land of plenty who have jobs or at least
a welfare state to fall back on.]{.underline} What made Tahrir Square a
completely different sort of movement was that the protestors had a
clear demand, which was life or death, and they refused to move until it
was met. We can debate how much difference came about when the military
took over from President Mubarak in Egypt but not the organic commitment
of the people to their struggle, nor that they risked their lives for
their cause. The stakes in the West are of a different nature and
therefore so are the politics. [Democracy]{.underline} as a principle
[runs through the new left agenda]{.underline}. In Britain the new left
is pushing for a more inclusive economy, similar to the demands of
Occupy. Neoliberalism is diagnosed as the source of the ills of society,
with the rich taking too much of the economic pie. **[We are promised
that by a 'democratic revolution' we can transform the institutions of
governance and society at large]{.underline}**.58 Not only is [this
struggle]{.underline} about income but it [is]{.underline} also about
reducing the social distance between people in society so that
'[everyone can share a common life as citizens']{.underline}.59 The
Labour Party under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn embraced these ideals
when he was unexpectedly voted leader in 2015. Prior to this, Labour had
been in a period of mimicking Conservative policy on the economy, fully
embracing neoliberalism with the idea that the spoils could be shared
across society. After Labour's surprising success (but not victory) in
the general election of 2017, Corbyn launched what he called Labour's
'radical and ambitious' manifesto for the 2019 election, promising to
transform both society and the economy.60 Labour's plans mirrored much
of the New Economic Foundation's recommendations for policy reform (the
NEF is a key think-tank for the new left). The NEF hits all the key
notes with the goal to build a society where all people are 'paid well,
have more time off to spend with their families, have access to
affordable housing, know there is a decent safety net if they need one,
and are provided with a high level of care throughout their lives'.61 In
order to do this they propose a four-day week, a living wage, boosting
trade union membership and fashioning a 'well-being state' where targets
are not simply economic but relate to the mental and physical health of
the nation. They stopped short of a universal basic income, instead
suggesting a far more modest national allowance of £50 a week that
counts when calculating benefit entitlements. But they are in favour of
universal basic services, nationalizing key industries and providing
free childcare to support families. The Green New Deal is of course
embraced as a motor for both saving the world and job creation. They are
also keen on 'people's participation in decision making' in both policy-
making and business.62 One of the NEF's and Labour's main focuses is on
establishing workers' cooperatives as a model for sharing wealth.
Preston, a small city in the north of England, has an outsize importance
in the new economy, since it has become a model for local-government led
cooperatives. The council's decision to source more locally and create
cooperatives in the city has both boosted income and dispersed that
extra money somewhat more fairly. Other large local employers like the
university have followed suit by engaging with local suppliers, and the
city is improving. But we should be wary of celebrating a radical new
dawn.63 For a start it is nothing new, with democratic reforms being
part of the left-wing imagination for 'at least a century'. Labour
governments and councils attempted such projects before neoliberalism
took over in the Thatcher era.64 John McDonnell, the architect of
Corbyn's economic policy, served his political apprenticeship in the
eighties under Tony Benn, who developed a series of cooperative
projects. **[The major flaw with these concepts of participation is who
is included and who remains firmly on the outside]{.underline}**. For
all the talk of participation there is scant regard for the fact that
those in the [underdeveloped world are equally stakeholders in the
economic life of the West]{.underline}. One of the cooperatives so
praised in Preston is a coffee shop, and while **[we celebrate the
benefits to the worker in Britain]{.underline}**, the shop's success is
**[only possible because of the racial exploitation of the poor
people]{.underline}** farming the coffee beans it uses for next to
nothing (it may be a surprise, but coffee does not grow in the north of
England). This is Cadbury World all over again but on a societal scale.
The wealth the left wants to share with those in their nations is
derived in large part from global, racial exploitation. What the new
left are offering is just a modified version of social democracy. A
return to the days of high taxes, social housing, reduced inequality and
the guarantee of a decent wage\... but only in the West. [In reality it
is not a social but an imperial democracy they are yearning
for.]{.underline}

### Root Cause: China Imperialism

In 2018 US president Donald Trump launched a trade war against China,
railing against the 'billions of dollars' lost to the country each year
in unbalanced trading on his favourite medium, Twitter. In a
particularly alarming social media rant, even for Trump, on 23 August
2019 he declared that The vast amounts of money made and stolen by China
from the United States, year after year, for decades, will and must
STOP. Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately
start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing your
companies HOME and making your products in the USA. Trying to reassert
American economic protectionism is one thing, but believing that he had
the power to order private corporations around displayed a spectacular
misunderstanding of both global capital and his own role. Trump's
concern over China was the substantial trade deficit between the two
countries. In 2018 the United States exported \$120 billion worth of
goods but *imported* over \$539 billion worth, making an almost \$420
billion loss in terms of trade.1 To counter this, the substance of
[Trump's trade war was to increase tariffs]{.underline} on Chinese
imports so that companies are disincentivized from doing business in the
country. [China retaliated,]{.underline} imposing its own tariffs on
American imports, with both countries using their actions as leverage
for a new trade agreement. [Trump's trade war was sparked by wider fears
that globalization is disadvantaging the West, and in particular
working-class communities]{.underline} that have seen their jobs
disappear overseas. The reason for the trade imbalance is that China is
now the workshop of the world, leading the way in manufacturing goods
for sale in the West including the United States. Nations across the
West have experienced the kind of de-industrialization that has seen
factories relocate to the underdeveloped world and large swathes of
people lose their jobs. Trump was elected in large part because he won
in the American 'rust belt', Midwestern states whose populations lost
out when manufacturing moved overseas. The trade war was a key part of
his 'Make America Great Again' appeal, taking on foreign nations who are
attacking United States power, and reasserting economic nationalism. [In
this version of the new world order the **real victims of the new age
are the White formerly working class**, **left behind by a global system
that now privileges foreign nations.**]{.underline} It is undeniable
that the post-war settlement has led to some interesting, and likely
unintended, [consequences in the operation of Western
imperialism]{.underline}. Manufacturing was previously the domain of the
West. Producing the goods to sell into newly found markets around the
world was one of the main goals of empire. [India's textile industry was
purposely destroyed]{.underline} so that Britain could lead the way in
manufacturing. This situation **[has now been completely
reversed]{.underline}**. Along with China, India is one of the fastest
growing economies and there is a real sense that centres of power are
shifting to the underdeveloped world. China is now seen as the main
threat to the West and there are projections that it will eventually
become the largest economy in the world. It has positive trade deficits
with every major nation and trillions of dollars in foreign exchange
reserves.2 The new economic and political order created after the Second
World War has **[paved the way for the rise of China and other
underdeveloped nations]{.underline}**. But if we imagine that the
development of non-Western, non-White countries proves that the racial
logic of empire has changed in any substantive way we are sorely
mistaken. **[China's rise is instructive, considering its predicted
global dominance has been due to the logic of Western imperialism, not
in spite of it.]{.underline}** After the declaration of the People's
Republic of China in 1949, the nation was a key part of the Communist
challenge to the capitalist status quo. China's support was central to
the defeat of United States forces in Korea and Vietnam, and China also
backed several African liberation struggles that threatened Western
dominance on that continent.3 But the China that has emerged today is
not the revolutionary Communist state that sought to reshape the
economic order. In truth, it is quite the opposite. To achieve its
current status **[China had to realize that the 'Western order is hard
to overturn and easy to join'.]{.underline}**4 China's economic rise
only began after the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the subsequent
repudiation of his policies. At that point China was an extremely poor
country which had undergone one of the worst famines in human history a
decade earlier. From 1978 the nation embraced capitalism, undergoing a
series of market reforms, welcoming foreign direct investment and making
exports the basis of its economy.5 This meant opening up China to the
rest of the world and fully engaging with global finance, and it was an
extremely successful approach: the nation pulled 600 million of its
citizens out of extreme poverty between 1978 and 2010. China's success
could be mistaken as evidence that the new economic system is not
inherently racist, if an underdeveloped country can make such strides.
But, as always, we should not get ahead of ourselves. China's emergence
has been due to the very reason that Trump started his trade war: its
domination of global manufacturing. 'Made in China' has become so
commonplace it is almost a surprise when an item is produced elsewhere.
But this occurred because the [cost of labour in China is so low
relative to the West.]{.underline} It is the same problem I discussed in
relation to India's economic miracle. While there is lots of wealth in
China, and many newly minted billionaires, there is also an abundance of
poverty. China may have the second largest economy in the world, but the
important measure is GDP per capita: the amount of wealth produced per
person. By this measure China is 65th, demonstrating that [many people
are not feeling the benefits of the growing economy.]{.underline} China
is extremely unequal and government statistics class anyone earning
\$295 a month as middle- income, despite the complaints from those
living on that amount that they cannot make ends meet.6 Because China's
position depends on being the world's primary exporter, [mass poverty is
necessary in order to sustain its economic growth]{.underline}. Just
like India, if the standard of living rises so too do the wages and
manufacturing costs. **[Soon enough China would find itself in the same
position as the West, offshoring its factory labour to a poorer
country]{.underline}**. What [Trump]{.underline} has seriously
misunderstood in his [trade war]{.underline} is that even if increased
costs through tariffs on Chinese goods incentivized manufacturers to
move, they **[would simply relocate to a different Black or Brown
country with inhumanly low labour costs]{.underline}**. There is only
one source in the West that can compete with the wages in the
underdeveloped world and that is prison labour, which no doubt explains
why Trump is a supporter of increased privatization of the sector. In
order to establish itself [China]{.underline} has relied on hundreds of
millions of its own citizens living in [conditions and taking wages that
would be unacceptable in the West]{.underline}. It's one of the [key
principles of Western imperialism]{.underline}: **[Black and Brown life
is worth less and it is therefore legitimate to exploit
it]{.underline}**. But it is not only in exploiting its own citizens
that China has embraced the logic of empire. White supremacy is based on
a hierarchy from White down to Black, with anti- Blackness a specific
feature of the system. In order to establish a secure footing, or to
move up the ladder of supremacy, there is a long history of other
racialized groups using Black populations as a stepping stone. China is
no different, as an examination of the nation's increasing role in
Africa demonstrates.

THE CHINESE SCRAMBLE FOR AFRICA China's links to Africa go back
centuries, at least as far as the Han dynasty in 202 BC. (The idea that
Europe initiated global trade and connectedness is one of the many
fictions of Whitewashed intellectual history.) [The Communist People's
Republic of China had strong ties to Africa and the liberation movements
to end colonialism]{.underline}. In the global fight against capital,
Mao was keen to support the armed struggle in places like Mozambique and
Angola. China was a key player in the 1955 Afro-Asian Bandung
Conference, which sought to create a united non-aligned front to combat
the global power of both the West and the Soviet bloc. China's
credentials in Africa were well forged and included building a railway
line connecting Zambia to Tanzania in the early 1970s. In return for its
support, African nations backed UN recognition of revolutionary China
and supported the nation's rise to prominence on the world stage.7
**[China was influential in the Black radical imagination and was seen
by many 'as the land where true freedom might be had'.]{.underline}**8
The Black Panther Party initially started fundraising by selling copies
of Mao's 'Little Red Book' to college students,9 and co-founder Huey P.
Newton invoked Mao in his book *Revolutionary Suicide* when he argued
that their revolutionary commitment was the Panthers' 'great leap
forward'.10 Numerous Panthers visited China, including Elaine Brown who
would become the party's chairperson. Given China's progressive history
with Africa and Black politics, its increasing influence on the African
continent has been welcomed by many. Indeed, China plays off its
historical relationship, painting itself as an underdeveloped country
aiming for a mutually beneficial relationship with a friend in need.
Although [China's]{.underline} links to Africa are not new, its
[economic role in the continent has drastically changed since the start
of the new millennium]{.underline}. From 2000 to 2012 trade between
China and Africa grew twenty-fold to \$200 billion.11 Between 2001 and
2010 China's Export--Import Bank provided \$67.2 billion in loans to
so-called sub-Saharan African countries, \$12.5 billion more than the
World Bank.12 [The West is wary of China's rapid expansion in Africa due
to the increased competition]{.underline} for resources in the region
and also because Chinese money provides an alternative to the
conditional loans enforcing the dreaded Washington consensus.13 China
does not attach structural adjustment strings to its loans, preferring
to stay out of matters of state and stick to finance. [**Chinese aid has
empowered African countries to say no to the devilish pacts with the IMF
and the World Bank.** While the West has looted resources and meddled in
political and economic systems, China has been busy building the roads,
dams, buildings and railways that Africa so sorely needs.]{.underline}
Not only that, but China has also invested in the manufacturing sector,
to the tune of over \$3 billion by the end of 2012.14 With its history
of comradeship, its massive investment, and the fact it represents an
alternative to the hated IMF and World Bank, it is easy to see why there
is some optimism and a view that 'the Chinese are our friends' among
many on the continent.15 But we must remember that the China that holds
the revolutionary link to Africa is an historical artefact. Since
China's economic reforms, the country has embraced the same political
and economic order that oppresses Africa, and in many ways has
legitimized neo-colonialism by posing as a friend.16 To understand
**[China's neo-colonial role in Africa]{.underline}** we need look no
further than the reason for its increased involvement in the first
place. **[After China embraced the capitalist global
order,]{.underline}** and its economy grew on the basis of production,
it needed to find fresh sources of raw materials. You cannot make the
goods for the world without their ingredients. China's entry into Africa
has been driven by the need to acquire resources such as oil and
minerals to secure its place in the global economy. China's expansion in
Africa also occurred mostly after it joined the World Trade Organization
in 2001 and it therefore operates firmly within the global economic
consensus that is a major part of the continued underdevelopment of
Africa. While Chinese money may not come with the requirement for
structural adjustment, it is a lie to say there are no strings attached.
For China finance is tied to natural resource extraction rather than
political control. China's interest rates are typically higher than
those from Western financial institutions and it generally takes payment
in the form of mining rights rather than cash. Therefore the vast
majority of Chinese assistance goes to mineral-rich African countries.
In places like Congo, Angola and Zambia, China is providing money to
build infrastructure while stripping the natural resources of the
countries. A classic example of this arrangement, in what was dubbed the
'deal of the century' when it was signed between China and the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 2007, is a \$9 billion loan that
meant China would commit to building roads, hospitals and other vital
infrastructure projects in return for almost monopolistic control over
the mining of cobalt and copper.17 It may sound like a good deal for
Congo, but consider that the minerals in question are worth an estimated
\$87 billion and it is quickly apparent that China is extracting the
materials from Congo for a fraction of what they are worth.18 The IMF
were against the loan because they wanted to offer their own finance
package with the usual conditions. But by avoiding the Western
institutions the DRC has jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire.
[Across the African continent, countries are making the same deals with
China, selling off their most valuable resources on the cheap to get at
least some infrastructure built]{.underline}. It is not hard to see why,
when Africa is in dire need of such spending, with estimates that it
requires well over \$22 billion spent annually to address its
infrastructure problems.19 But these resources are precious to the
future of Africa, which by rights should be the richest place on earth
thanks to its abundance of natural wealth. By cashing in, **[the
continent is destroying its future.]{.underline}** Natural resources are
finite and for Africa to prosper it should be maximizing the wealth
produced from them to truly transform the continent. Green technology
will become the next boom industry and Africa holds a bounty of the
minerals necessary for the shift to sustainable energy. [China, on the
other hand, has only accelerated the exploitation of Africa's
resources.]{.underline} Worse still, the model used to build this
infrastructure is of more benefit to China than Africa. When signing
agreements such as the 'deal of the century' China insists that it
provides the majority of the equipment and labour (usually 70 per
cent).20 In effect the vast majority of the 'aid' that is given to a
country is spent buying goods from China and paying Chinese companies
and workers to rebuild Africa. China is basically providing a stimulus
to its own economy, dressed up as foreign aid. Not only does the
recipient country have to pay this loan back with interest but [China
also reaps massive profits]{.underline} from its preferential access to
precious mineral resources. This model has all of the '*Alice in
Wonderland* craziness' about it that Kwame Nkrumah [described in Western
neo- colonialism]{.underline}.21 Even China's support for infrastructure
spending is not as benevolent as it can appear. European colonizers
spent massive sums on roads, railways and the like because they were
necessary to extract the wealth out of the continent. When the Chinese
offer to build roads that connect an untapped mine to the sea, they are
not doing so out of their wish to better the economic circumstances of
Africa. China has also built forty-four sports stadiums in Africa,
raising serious questions about the nature and utility of its
infrastructure spending.22 These projects routinely end up as white
elephants, something the rulers can use to show off but which have no
long-term beneficial impact on the economy. It is abundantly clear that
**[China's involvement in infrastructure is not a break with the logic
of Western empire]{.underline}**. It may be a different model, but it is
one that supports the principles and functioning of the current system.
After all, the **[Chinese are extracting these resources to make
products to be sold, in large part, to the West]{.underline}**. China's
presence in Africa is also not always at odds with Western interests.
There are a number of direct collaborations between Chinese and Western
companies in Africa, who are after all in the region for the same
reasons. The French company Total partnered with a Chinese oil company
to extract oil from the Nigerian seabed,23 and Chinese companies also
enrich themselves by bidding for contracts funded by Western agencies
like the World Bank. Bamako International Airport in Mali underwent a
\$181 million upgrade between 2007 and 2012 funded by the Millennium
Challenge Corporation, a US aid agency. **[Regardless of the fact that
China and the United States may be in a struggle for global dominance,
this United States government contract was carried out by Chinese
workers.24]{.underline}** Migrant workers being imported into Africa to
rebuild the continent has created a specific form of tension. It is
estimated that there are now over 1 million Chinese people living in
Africa, attracted to the continent by the opportunities there. It should
be no surprise that the natives of the poorest continent in the world
are wary. Chinese migrant workers enjoy better pay and working
conditions. This marks a reversal of Chinese people being used as a
cheap and discriminated-against labour force to build the original
version of Western empire. China is now providing the frontier folk,
seeking new opportunities. It is also not difficult to find attitudes
reminiscent of the old European colonizers who went to Africa to make
their fortunes. In journalist Howard French's book *China's Second
Continent* he explains how commonplace colonial-era racism was with the
Chinese migrants he spoke to across Africa. His discussion with Hao, a
migrant to Mozambique, stands out. Hao had migrated with little, had not
learned a local language, and yet managed to acquire 5,000 acres of
land, much to the displeasure of the locals, and planned to grow cash
crops to sell to Western countries. He explained his decision to try his
luck in Mozambique as follows: Can you imagine if I had gone to America
or to Germany first? The people in those fucking places are too smart. I
wouldn't have gotten anywhere. I don't think I could have beaten them.
So we had to find backward countries, poor countries that we can lead.25
Colonial-era attitudes could also be found among those delivering aid
projects. Li Jinjun, head of the Central Agricultural Research Institute
in Liberia, explained that the Chinese would only run the project for a
limited time in order that the locals 'learn to support themselves'. In
classic civilizing mission language, the Institute was proud that
'little by little\... can change them in this way.'26 Of course, we
cannot generalize these attitudes to the whole of the Chinese migrant
population in Africa but we also should not be surprised if they are
prevalent. They are only important insofar as they speak to the wider
power dynamics of the Chinese neo-colonial relationship with Africa.
**[Objections to Chinese migration are not solely down to their colonial
attitudes or denying locals the opportunity to work on infrastructure
projects, but tie into the other major area where China has continued
the work of Western imperialism on the continent.]{.underline}** As
heralded as the increased trade between China and Africa has been, it
represents the classic relationship between colonizer and colony.
China's imports from Africa are comprised of well over 90 per cent oil
and other natural resources. At the same time, Africa's imports from
China are 90 per cent finished manufactured products. Africa exports its
resources well below the value that they are worth to China, which
manufactures goods and sells them back into Africa, collecting all the
profit. As a result China is able to produce cheap goods and flood
African markets at prices that local producers have no way of competing
with. The result has been a de-industrialization of Africa as local
manufacturers are forced out of business. In 2008 manufacturing made up
12.8 per cent of GDP in Africa, and just eight years later that figure
had fallen to 10.5 per cent. Between 1980 and 2008 Africa's share of
global manufacturing was down from 1.2 per cent to 0.9 per cent.27 In
Nigeria the impact of Chinese textile imports has been devastating to
local manufacturing. In the 1980s there were 175 textile factories in
the country, but within twenty-five years that number had declined to
only twenty-five. Even though imported textiles are illegal they account
for over 85 per cent of the market and are valued at \$2.2 billion
annually, versus only \$40 million for locally produced products.28 The
impact on jobs has been catastrophic, with the number of those working
in Nigeria's textile industry in 2015 declining to 20,000 from 600,000
in the 1990s.29 The result has been tension and even strikes in Senegal
over the presence of the Chinese in local markets: they have become a
feature as imports have flooded in. There is no doubt that the Chinese
who are trading into Africa are profiting from the underdeveloped state
of Africa and taking advantage of the situation created by Western
imperialism. This kind of opportunism from those whose skin is not White
is also nothing new for Africa. Lebanese traders were dominant as
middlemen between the French and their African colonies and there was a
similar relationship between South Asian communities in East Africa and
the British. The only real difference with the Chinese is that they are
not playing the role of middlemen to European colonizers; instead they
represent one of the strongest emerging neo-colonial forces. China is
certainly not a colonial power in the same way as Britain, France or any
of the other European nations were. There is no invasion, violence and
domination of political affairs. But, as we already know, that is not
how the new age of empire works. Although the former colonial masters
may have links and historical advantages in particular countries
(particularly in relation to language), [underdeveloped economies are
open to exploitation from any nation or corporation that has the
capital.]{.underline} There is no metropolis, no mother country, [just a
racialized political and economic system that allows for such
exploitation.]{.underline}

[When]{.underline} was [the]{.underline} last [time you heard good news
about the state of black America? Given the way the topic is reported in
the media, you could be forgiven for not remembering. Most will be
familiar with [the]{.mark} standard portrayal: [black]{.mark} people are
disproportionately poor, incarcerated, born into single-parent homes,
and harassed by cops.]{.underline} There's the test score gap, which
places black kids at a disadvantage when applying to college; the
school-to-prison pipeline, which prepares black boys for prison by
punishing them disproportionately in school; and the racial wealth gap,
which won't close for several centuries if current trends continue. In
an era when bipartisan agreement is scarce, the Left and the Right seem
to be united in their somber assessment of black America, though they
locate the blame in different places. Democrats tend to blame systemic
racism and the legacy of white supremacy. Republicans, on the other
hand, tend to blame Democrats. [Recall President Trump's infamous appeal
for the black vote: "You're living in poverty. Your schools are no good.
You have no jobs," he maintained, blaming the Clintons for these
circumstances. "What the hell do you have to lose?]{.underline}" [The
[narrative of doom and gloom]{.mark}, however, [is
misleading]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Though it has gone largely unnoticed,
[black Americans have been making rapid progress along most important
dimensions of well-being since the turn of the
millennium]{.mark}]{.underline}. Let's start with incarceration. Without
doubt, there is plenty of reason to be pessimistic about the U.S. prison
system. America incarcerates a larger proportion of its citizens than
any nation on earth. Black Americans, at 13 percent of the U.S.
population, made up one-third of the nation's incarcerated population in
2017. To make matters worse, conditions inside many prisons are
ill-suited for rehabilitation. Alabama's state prisons, for instance,
are so rife with violence and sexual assault that Trump's Justice
Department has charged them with violating the eighth amendment to the
constitution, which bans "cruel and unusual punishments." [Nevertheless,
there are reasons to be optimistic. [From 2001 to 2017,]{.mark} [the
incarceration rate]{.mark} [for black men]{.mark} [declined]{.mark} by
[34 percent]{.mark}. Even this statistic, however, understates progress
by lumping black Americans of all ages together. When you look at
age-specific incarceration outcomes, you find two opposing trends: Older
black Americans are doing slightly worse than previous generations, but
younger black Americans are doing better---so much better that they more
than offset, in statistical terms, the backslide of their
elders.]{.underline} To put the speed [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} size of
the trend in perspective, between my first day of Kindergarten in 2001
and my first legal drink in 2017, the incarceration rate for black men
aged 25--29, 20--24, and 18--19 declined, respectively, by 56 percent,
60 percent, and 72 percent. [[For]{.mark} young [black women]{.mark},
the story is similar: [a]{.mark} 59 percent drop for those aged 25--29,
a [43 percent]{.mark} [drop]{.mark} for those aged 20--24, and a 69
percent drop for those aged 18--19. As a result of the divergent
generational trendlines, the black prison population is not only
shrinking; it's aging too. In 2017, nearly three in ten black male
prisoners were 45 years of age or older, up from one in ten in 2001.
That may not seem like good news, but it is.]{.underline} The
incarceration trendline for young blacks in the recent past predicts the
trendline for all blacks in the near future. So the fact that the
post-2001 incarceration decline for blacks in general was entirely
caused by the plunging incarceration rate for young blacks in particular
suggests that, as generational turnover occurs, the black prison
population will not only continue to shrink, but will shrink at an
accelerating rate. To paraphrase the economist Rick Nevin, our prison
system may be overflowing today, but the "pipeline" to prison is already
starting to run dry. [[The]{.mark} great incarceration [decline]{.mark}
for black youth [has been matched by a decline in teenage
motherhood]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Between 2001 and 2017, the birth rate
for black women aged 15--19 declined [by 63
percent]{.mark}.]{.underline} In fact, the black teenage birth rate in
2017 was lower than the white teenage rate as recently as 2002. Nor has
progress been confined to the younger generation. Between 1999 and 2015,
the mortality rate for black Americans aged 65 and over shrank by 29
percent for cancer, 31 percent for diabetes, and 43 percent for heart
disease. What's more, all of those percentage drops were larger than the
drops experienced by comparable whites over the same period. As deaths
from disease have plummeted, black lives have extended. [In 2017, black
female life expectancy was 78.5 years, up from 75.1 years in 2000. [Life
expectancy]{.mark} for black men [increased]{.mark} from 68.2 to 71.9
years over the same timespan. [Not only are black Americans
healthier]{.mark} and longer-lived [than]{.mark} they were [two decades
ago]{.mark}, [they're]{.mark} also [more educated]{.mark}. Between the
1999--2000 and 2016--2017 school years, the number of black students who
earned bachelor's degrees increased by 82 percent, from 108,018 to
196,300. Over the same period, the number of associate's and master's
degrees awarded to black students more than doubled, rising from 60,208
to 129,874, and 36,606 to 89,577, respectively (population growth
accounts for some, but not all or even most, of this growth). 2018
census data showed that 37 percent of black Americans aged 25--34 had
some kind of college degree.]{.underline} If black America were its own
country, that would place it in between Germany (31 percent) and Spain
(43 percent) in terms of educational attainment. What's more, the
economist Raj Chetty has found that black women, though less likely to
attend college than white women, are now more likely to attend college
than white men from similar socioeconomic backgrounds. Along with more
education has come more upward mobility. [[The Federal Reserve]{.mark}
recently [reported]{.mark} that over [60 percent of blacks]{.mark} at
every level of educational attainment [say they're doing better
financially than their parents---]{.mark}a higher percentage than either
whites or Hispanics. [And]{.mark} although black men still lag behind
white men in terms of upward mobility, Chetty has found that [black
women]{.mark} now go on to [earn slightly higher incomes than white
women from similar]{.mark} socioeconomic [backgrounds]{.mark}. All told,
there is more than enough data with which to tell an optimistic story
about the recent history of black America.]{.underline} However, the
same data that justify this optimism can appear to justify pessimism if
you look at it differently. Recall, for instance, the 72 percent drop in
the incarceration rate for black men aged 18--19 from 2001 to 2017.
Framed as such, it looks like progress. But here's the same data framed
differently: In 2001, black men aged 18--19 were nine times more likely
to be behind bars than comparable white men. By 2017, they were twelve
times more likely to be behind bars. [Framed as such, it looks like
regress. This particular framing effect is just one example in a larger
pattern: The evidence against racial progress tends to compare
black-white gaps today to black-white gaps in the past. Here, white
metrics are used as benchmarks against which to measure black progress.
By contrast, the evidence in favor of progress tends to compare black
metrics today against black metrics in the past. White metrics do not
enter the equation.]{.underline} Crucially, the same data can often be
made to look like either progress or regress depending on which
framework is chosen. The question of black progress, therefore, is less
a matter of weighing the reality of progress against the reality of
regress than it is a matter of looking at the same reality through two
different lenses. Through one lens, progress means reducing the size of
black-white racial gaps; let's call this the gap-lens. But through
another lens, progress means improving black outcomes relative to where
they were in the past; let's call this the past-lens.

#### Black progress now \-\-- acknowledging it sustains change!

**Hughes 19** [(Coleman Hughes; Colombia University graduate with a B.A.
in Philosophy; 9-28-2019; \"The Case for Black Optimism\"; Quillete;
https://quillette.com/2019/09/28/the-case-for-black-optimism/; Accessed

The rationale for choosing the gap-lens is this: [if not for our racist
history, the racial gaps we observe today would not exist.]{.underline}
That history includes not only two and a half centuries of chattel
slavery, but also the many and varied Jim Crow era policies, from school
segregation to redlining, that prevented blacks from taking advantage of
the American dream. To measure the width of a racial gap, this view
holds, is to measure the depth of America's failure to redress that
history. What's more, if we fail to close statistical gaps between
blacks and whites, then we would be surrendering ourselves to live in a
permanently racially-stratified society, a society in which---even if
everyone were doing better than their parents---whites would hold more
economic power than blacks in perpetuity. [Though the rationale behind
it is powerful, the gap-lens, taken to its logical end, borders on the
absurd]{.underline}. Imagine we had a button that doubled the amount of
everything good for each racial group and halved the rate of everything
bad---so, black wealth doubles, white wealth doubles, black
incarceration is halved, white incarceration is halved, and so on. As we
pressed the button repeatedly, America would increasingly approach
utopia. Yet the racial gaps---that is, the ratios between black and
white outcomes---would remain unchanged. Therefore, **[viewed through
the gap-lens, we will have made no progress at all]{.underline}**.
Indeed, **[any amount of black progress can become invisible when viewed
through the gap-lens,]{.underline}** given sufficient white progress.
That's a problem. A framework for progress that, under certain
conditions, would not recognize the difference between our current world
and a quasi-utopia seems, frankly[, to miss the point of the word. The
gap-lens also relies on the dubious presumption that white outcomes are
the best benchmark against which to measure black outcomes]{.underline}.
One reason this presumption fails is that the median white American is a
[full
decade](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/30/most-common-age-among-us-racial-ethnic-groups/)
older than the median black American. Thus, comparing all blacks to all
whites on any outcome that varies with age---for instance*,*
incarceration or wealth---is [comparing apples to oranges.]{.underline}
More importantly, when we compare black outcomes to white outcomes and
blame all of the gaps on institutional racism, we treat American society
as if it were a simple 8th-grade science experiment: **[white people are
treated as the "control group"; black people are treated as the
"experimental group";]{.underline}** and the "independent variable,"
applied only to blacks, is institutional racism. On this oversimplified
paradigm, we could reasonably assume that all racial outcome gaps are
caused by institutional racism. But reality is more complex. Black
Americans and white Americans are unique groups of people with different
histories, different demographics, and different sociological
characteristics. Such confounding [variables make it overly simplistic
to pin all [racial
gaps](https://quillette.com/2018/05/14/the-racism-treadmill/) on
institutional racism.]{.underline} Despite such flaws, the gap-lens is
the default lens through which many scholars and journalists view black
America today. Whether it's wealth, incarceration, or education, the
habit of framing black metrics relative to white metrics is so deeply
ingrained that it seems naïve to observe that we do not view other
racial groups this way. Which is to say, when we ask whether white
Americans have made progress, we compare whites not against some other
group but against themselves at an earlier point in time. Why, then, do
we treat the analysis of black America differently? For many, the answer
lies in history. It makes sense to analyze black America with a unique
lens precisely because black Americans trail a unique history of
oppression. There is no way to acknowledge that ugly history, in this
view, without looking directly at the gaps caused by it. I understand
this rationale, and have some sympathy with it. However, it ignores the
downsides associated with focusing on racial gaps. There is a spectrum
of possible outcomes in multi-ethnic societies with violent, segregated
conflict at one end, and peaceful, integrated cooperation at the other.
Somewhere in between lies a circumstance, neither disastrous nor ideal,
in which members of different racial groups are encouraged to measure
themselves against one another, generating racial envy and resentment.
Americans in general, and black Americans in particular, currently exist
in such a circumstance. Yet because it is the water in which we swim, it
is difficult to recognize that such racial tensions are not the
inevitable consequence of living in a racially disparate society. It is
easier to see the role played by the commentariat in generating racial
tensions by looking at situations in which such tensions were absent*.*
For example, in his essay, "[The Politics of a Multiethnic
Society](https://books.google.com/books?id=jIZ0j7wmuGUC&pg=PA334&lpg=PA334&dq=If+these+groups+had+analyzed+the+statistics,+they+might+have+found+much+to+grouse+about.+Since+the+Irish+dominated+electoral+politics,+all+other+groups+were+by+that+token+%E2%80%98deprived.%E2%80%99+Since+the+Jews+were+the+most+successful+in+terms+of+high+occupational+status,+all+the+others+were+by+that+token+%E2%80%98deprived.%E2%80%99+Yet+that+is+not+the+way+the+political+debate+went,+and+all+the+European+ethnic+groups+believed+they+had+done+well+in+America,+and+there+is+scarcely+a+one+that+bears+grievances.&source=bl&ots=1Xzml7fjUO&sig=ACfU3U0NJggY8jrTjB29V8bTKmYaGjnYTg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgmOrJ5uXkAhWtY98KHTUiBgMQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=If%20these%20groups%20had%20analyzed%20the%20statistics%2C%20they%20might%20have%20found%20much%20to%20grouse%20about.%20Since%20the%20Irish%20dominated%20electoral%20politics%2C%20all%20other%20groups%20were%20by%20that%20token%20%E2%80%98dep),"
the late Harvard sociologist Nathan Glazer made the following
observation about European immigrant groups in the American Northeast:
If these groups had analyzed the statistics, they might have found much
to grouse about. Since the Irish dominated electoral politics, all other
groups were by that token "deprived." Since the Jews were the most
successful in terms of high occupational status, all the others were by
that token "deprived." Yet that is not the way the political debate
went, and all the European ethnic groups believed they had done well in
America, and there is scarcely a one that bears grievances. [The key
observation in Glazer's analysis is not that these ethnic groups were
successful (though they were), but that they **believed they were
successful**]{.underline}. Implied in that observation is the idea that
a group of people can be doing quite well but can nevertheless be made
to believe the opposite---so long as they are habitually compared to
other groups in the media. It's a truism that a single person suffers
when he measures himself by the yardstick of another, particularly when
the other person had various advantages and head starts that he lacked.
In a similar way, by forever **[measuring blacks against an improper
yardstick, the gap-lens, though intended as a way of acknowledging the
unique history of oppression blacks have endured, in effect punishes
them twice for it.]{.underline}** To be sure, there are circumstances in
which it makes sense to define progress in terms of closing racial gaps.
For instance, having political leaders who reflect the population in
terms of race and ethnicity is, everything else held equal, good for the
social fabric of a multi-ethnic society. To that end, I'm not arguing
that we should abolish the use of the gap-lens in every case. I'm
arguing that, in the great majority of cases, the past-lens yields a
more useful picture of the state of black America. Which is to say,
[black progress can be]{.underline} understood independent of white
progress and [celebrated on its own terms.]{.underline} What do we gain
by acknowledging progress? For one thing, [ignorance]{.underline} of how
much progress blacks have made in recent years [leads many to mistakenly
believe American institutions are so racist that nothing]{.underline}
short of complete overhaul [would suffice to repair them]{.underline}.
The fact that those very same institutions have allowed for, if not
ushered in, huge amounts of progress for black people in recent years
suggests a more sober-minded approach. We should not burn the system
down. We should reform it one increment at a time. More importantly,
**[if we want to continue making progress]{.underline}**, then **[we
must understand the root causes of progress,]{.underline}** and in order
to understand its root causes, **[we must first acknowledge that
progress has happened. In recent decades,]{.underline}** black Americans
have been progressing, sometimes rapidly, along virtually every
dimension worth caring about. And, without becoming complacent, we can
be cautiously optimistic that such progress will continue. A complete
conversation about race and racial inequality must involve not just
identifying what goes wrong, but also what goes right---[for if we fail
to learn from the triumphs of our own recent past, we are doomed not to
repeat them.]{.underline}
