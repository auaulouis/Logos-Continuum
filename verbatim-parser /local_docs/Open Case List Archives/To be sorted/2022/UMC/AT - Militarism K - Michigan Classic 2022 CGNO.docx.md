## 2AC -- Militarization Good

#### Militarization is key to Russia deterrence

of Russian Policy*, German Marshall Fund of the United States, 2017, pp.

Since February 2014, [NATO Allies have become increasingly aware of
Russia's determination to disrupt the cohesion of the West]{.underline}
as we have come to define it. However, doubts persist about the degree
of strategic thinking that motivates its policy. The picture we have
presented not only outlines a strategic framework. It delineates, even
by [Russian]{.underline} standards, an unusual degree of integration
between the political objectives of the state and the expansion of its
military power. That expansion is not a Brownian motion. It is a
[coherent and purpose-driven activity designed to challenge Western
dominance of an international order]{.underline} that Russia's state
leadership perceives as harmful to its interests and intrinsically
vulnerable. For understandable reasons, many in the West are also
addressing the critical question of how our own policy tools might be
used to change Russian mindsets and perceptions. But the underlying
challenge, much as Putin has aggravated it, is not Russian perceptions,
but its interests. And, where European security is concerned, Moscow's
interests can be expected to diverge from ours in significant respects
even if Putin is replaced by a successor with different priorities. The
more immediate challenge is to change Western mindsets rather than
Russian ones. [Our homo economicus, business school metrics do not
explain very much about Putin's Russia]{.underline}. State mobilization
might impose serious diseconomies on an already overburdened resource
base. But as long as it continues, it continues and produces
consequences that NATO needs to confront and counter. Those who believe
that compromise, vigorous dialogue, or neorealist grand bargains will
resolve our differences have been neither watching nor listening.
Dialogue will never be more effective than the policy underpinning it.
Angela Merkel's exhaustive discussions with Vladimir Putin have provided
useful reinforcement to a moderately tough policy. John Kerry's
indefatigable dialogue with Sergey Lavrov over Syria only amplified
weakness. The Kremlin is willing to match us in talking as well as
fighting. Its curt and pre-emptive rejection of a grand bargain with the
United States at the start of the Trump administration is telling in
itself. [Russia expects material changes to the structure of
international relations and is determined to press its perceived
advantages until concessions are forced upon us.]{.underline} The only
way to diminish the threats Russia poses is to diminish these
advantages. Once that imperative is accepted, we will find that the news
is not all that bad. Time does not favor Russia. True enough, Russia has
defied repeated Western forecasts about the unsustainability of its
economic model. Low oil prices and Western sanctions have brought its
proverbial coping mechanisms and organizational ingenuity to the fore.
Nevertheless, Russia's economy is in decline, its technological base is
stagnant, and the mobilization reflex merely postpones the day when its
structural problems are either addressed or wreak vengeance. Thus, the
West has good grounds for strategic patience. However, time is not a
strategic actor. It has to be used. For strategic patience to bear
fruit, there must be a strategy as well as patience. [Deterrence is only
a strategy if it addresses the threat to be deterred]{.underline}. As
serious students of Russian strategy have noted, war with Russia means
war with all of Russia. [Yet the war Russia is preparing to fight has
limited objectives: to shatter the cohesion of NATO, destroy its forces
in the operational theater, and force it to concede defeat at the
earliest possible moment. Without confidence in these outcomes, Russia
will not go to war. The aim of NATO's deterrence must be to convince
Russia that any war against NATO means war with all of NATO, wherever
its forces are based.]{.underline} **[To this end, the priority for
Western military establishments is not to outmatch the Russians where
they are naturally strong, but to invest in the antidotes to these
strengths]{.underline}**. The Alliance confronted a similar challenge at
the height of the Brezhnev era. Its "dual track" decision of 1979 forced
the Soviets to contend with mobile, high-readiness, theaterbased nuclear
systems that could have been used to devastating effect at the outset of
conflict. Coupled with the exploitation of then revolutionary "smart"
non-nuclear U.S. Army weapons and war-fighting concepts (AirLand
Battle), the West effectively threatened to annul ten years of Soviet
investment in a "strategic offensive operation" against NATO. NATO
undertook this task in the teeth of unprecedented internal opposition to
its policy (focused on the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament) and an
intense Soviet active measures campaign in Europe. The [result of the
new NATO policy was not an apocalyptic confrontation, but a change of
course for the USSR and a process of mutual de-escalation of military
threats and political tensions in Europe.]{.underline} [Today's
conditions are in one respect more promising]{.underline} than those
that confronted NATO 35 to 40 years ago. Gerasimov's anxiety, "the
destruction of military forces and key state assets in several hours,"
derives from "prompt global strike" and shorter range non-nuclear
systems against which Russia might only be able to threaten nuclear
retaliation. Strategically, they have the potential to threaten assets
critical to war-waging and state management without producing nuclear
devastation. Operationally, they might cut several of Russia's pathways
to escalation dominance that presently exist[. From a Russian
perspective, this new generation of weapons is destabilizing**; from a
Western perspective, the opposite**]{.underline}. Investment in these
systems will not absolve NATO of the need to maintain a coherent nuclear
posture. But when combined with other means of enhancing the West's
robustness and resilience, it will constrain Russia's ability to fight
war on its terms. If it cannot do so, it is most unlikely to fight at
all. The observation of Finland's leading expert on Russian military
policy is worth citing: In the Georgian and Ukrainian crises and Syrian
air operations, Russia has demonstrated its high readiness for limited
military operations to secure and promote its national interests in
situations when, according to its estimation, success is easily gained
and risk of unfavourable escalation is low.36 In these respects,
Vladimir Putin is a good steward of Russian tradition. Only two
conditions have provoked Russia during his tenure: weaknesses (Ukraine
in conditions of state collapse and Syria after a geopolitical vacuum
had been created by the United States) and bluff (NATO's ill-judged 2008
promise that Georgia and Ukraine "will become members of NATO"). No
example can be found of Russia attacking a stronger opponent that
understood its own strength. **[A strong opponent afraid of its own
strength is only asking for trouble]{.underline}**. [The simple and most
basic object of deterrence is to persuade would-be opponents that force
is not the solution to their problems. **But it is not simple to
achieve**]{.underline}. In 1987 the Soviet Union concluded that  "the
application of military means to resolve any dispute is inadmissible
under current conditions."37 It is not beyond our means to bring Russia
to the same conclusion

## 2ac -- Small States

#### NATO and the US have a vested interest in protecting and incorporating smaller states

James **Jay**, 8-10-20**18**, \"Why Small States Matter to Big Powers,\"
National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/why-small-states-matter-big-powers-28362//CDMoney

[Nobody is bigger than the United States of America]{.underline}. **[No
big power more appreciates small powers]{.underline}**. [No small state
will find a better friend than the United States.]{.underline} In an era
of great power competition, "[small" matters a good deal.]{.underline}
Little nations are not sand to be ground between the great wheels of
major powers. **[They are made up of people, not pawns.]{.underline}**
[Citizens in small states have the same hopes, aspirations and natural
rights as those in world powers. These people have every reason to
expect and demand a life of freedom, peace and prosperity.]{.underline}
Further, it [is in the interests of bigger states to help small states
flourish]{.underline}. Great powers, if wise, will [support the best
hopes of smaller states.]{.underline} There are three reasons why the
United States, in particular, ought to take small states seriously.
Sonovia **[1. Geography Matters]{.underline}**. In geopolitics---as in
real estate---a critical consideration is "location, location,
location." To a major power, a country's greatest asset might be its map
coordinates rather than the size of its arsenal or bank account.
Geography matters when it comes to economic integration, transportation,
energy distribution and physical security. Even in a digitized world,
the freedom to move people, goods, and services across physical space is
a valuable commodity. Recognizing the importance of connecting dots on
the ground is not an argument for hardened spheres of control (such as
during the Cold War) or carving up the world (like seventeenth-century
mercantilists). On the other hand, there is a [case to be made for
building bridges between like-minded nations that want to live together
with surety in commerce and share peaceful borders. Thus, a small state
in the right place can be very important to a big power. **Iceland** is
a case in point. Even though it has no armed forces, the island's
location makes the nation a **lynchpin in transatlantic security.**
That's the **reason Iceland** was included as one of twelve **founding
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.**]{.underline}
Without question, Iceland's strategic location is of far greater
importance to U.S. security than the state's size and resources would
suggest. Washington should be working hard to make that bilateral
relationship even stronger. [Part of the reason **NATO** continues to
**keep** the **membership door open** is **because** there are **nations
still not included whose accession would enhance collective security**
due to their location.]{.underline} These include Macedonia, Georgia,
Ukraine and Kosovo. And there are states in other regions where stronger
bilateral relations would greatly serve U.S. interests. Closer ties with
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, for example, would further U.S. efforts to
sustain a free and open Indo-Pacific. In the Middle East, [few states
are smaller than Jordan. Yet, a **peaceful, prosperous Jordan** is a
**keystone for regional stability**, and **regional stability is a vital
interest of the United States**]{.underline}---as important to this
administration as it should have been to the last one. Similarly,
Tunisia is an important state for extending an umbrella of regional
stability in the greater Middle East to North Africa. 2. Freedom
Matters. Like-minded nations make better partners. [One of the reasons
NATO works is because the alliance is a partnership of free
nation-states.]{.underline} The [foundational rationale of the
transatlantic alliance is that free states have the right to associate
for the purpose of collective security. **To close NATO's open door
would undermine what NATO stands for: the right of free peoples to
choose their future.**]{.underline}

#### **If not already, aff increases coordination and quality of life for smaller states**

James **Jay**, 8-10-20**18**, \"Why Small States Matter to Big Powers,\"
National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/why-small-states-matter-big-powers-28362//CDMoney

Building Bridges to Small Nations The [United States has an inherent
advantage over adversarial powers in partnering with small nations.
**China and Russia don't have allies**]{.underline}. They have
underlings. [No country wants to be a suburb of Beijing or Moscow.
**America, however, has to up its game.**]{.underline} Here is a
ten-step process to get the job done. Step 1. Set the Right Objectives
for Friends. In [reducing vulnerabilities of friends, allies and
strategic partners to adversarial influences]{.underline}, American
[objectives should be framed less in driving particular political
outcomes or agendas]{.underline} (e.g., promoting marriage equality)
[than in achieving good stable governance, strong institutions and a
reduction in corruption.]{.underline} This will make our partners more
resilient and self-confident. Step 2. Avoid Us-or-Them-ism. The goal of
a small-state strategy is not to exclude adversarial competitors. For
example, America can't ask countries not to do business with China.
After all, the United States does business with China. The goal is not
to get countries to takes sides but to engage and help them act
consistent with their own interests---eschewing, for instance, economic
engagement detrimental to national security or that undermines the rule
of law and good governance. Step 2. Promote Economic Freedom. China and
Russia can buy influence because, in poor nations with weak governance,
a little money goes a long far. The [best way to make these states more
resistant to malicious influence is to help them become wealthier and
better governed. This is best accomplished by promoting economic
freedom.]{.underline} Step 3. Enter Free Trade Agreements (FTA). Trade
agreements fundamentally have to be about liberalizing trade and making
markets freer. That said, **[prioritizing agreements with states where
the United States is seeking friendship, and common cause makes
sense]{.underline}**. America, for example, ought to have an FTA with
Tunisia. Step 4. Be There. In many small, like-minded nations, [all the
United States has to do to win friends is, simply, to be there. Too much
American engagement rests on foreign assistance and not enough on
building human-to-human relationships and a more robust presence by the
U.S. private sector.]{.underline}

## Author Indicts 

#### Balko is biased!

**McMichael 16** (Christopher, PhD in Politics from Rhodes University,

"Pacification and Police: A critique of the Police Militarization
Thesis," November 29 2016,
https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)

 Strikingly, and little commented on by liberal or leftist outlets, some
of the most vocal proponents of the 'militarization' thesis (at least
within the context of the United States) have been from the Libertarian
Right. An article published by the Foundation for Economic Education
(FEE) portrays the disturbing arrival of a 'new breed of cop' with a
'military mentality' ([Greenhunt
2008](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)),
while an essay in the journal of the Independent Institute claims that a
long standing separation between the domestic police and military
functions of the US government has been irrevocably breached ([Hall and
Coyne
2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
501). By far the most influential advocate of the militarization
doctrine is Radley Balko, a former writer and analyst for libertarian
institutions Reason Magazine and the Cato Institute, the latter of which
has intimate ties with the powerful Koch Brothers, who have also
increasingly become concerned with police reform. Balko, currently of
the Huffington Post, is a prolific and outspoken journalist, who has
written countless media articles and policy reports and two books on the
subject: Overkill: The Rise of Paramilitary Police Raids in
America ([Balko
2006](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569))
and the more recent Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of
America's Police Forces ([Balko
2013a](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)). [Balko
(2006)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569) maintains
that domestic law enforcement has become dangerously invasive:
'Americans have long maintained that a man's home is his castle and that
he has the right to defend it from unlawful intruders. Unfortunately,
that right may be disappearing' (p. iv). His main contention is that
such tactics have encouraged a dangerous blurring between the police and
military, in which the police work of protecting public safety is
confused with the military work of seeking and destroying enemies
([Balko
2006](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
15). Despite Balko's work focusing primarily on the United States, it
has transcended its North American trappings, with his work referenced
in a report prepared by the South African government, which called for
the 'demilitarization' of the national police force ([National
Development Plan
2012](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569):
392). Although his work is often cited in progressive or radical
publications[, Balko's politics are squarely on the right: getting his
start with Fox News, and then working long stints for Republican Party
aligned think tanks, calling for the privatization of social welfare and
prisons and, of course, defending the public influence of the Koch
Brothers ([Ames & Levine
2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0309816816678569)).]{.underline}

It is important to note that according to the Law Enforcement Support
Office (LESO, 2020), [5% of the excess property that law enforcement
agencies receive are small arms (handguns), and less than 1% are
tactical vehicles. Some of the weapons and tactical vehicles that can be
acquired include: MRAPs (Mine Resistant Vehicles), other armored
vehicles, night vision (sights, binoculars, goggles and lights),
aircraft (planes and helicopters), machine guns (5.56mm and 7.62mm
rifles) and or magazines with no ammunition. The vast majority of
property acquired through the program includes clothing, office
supplies, tools, and rescue equipment and is thus not militarized (LESO,
2020).]{.underline}

<https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6.pdf>)

In what way should one expect NATO to enhance democratic development?
After all, as highlighted above, [[democracy is a **core principle** of
the institution]{.mark}.]{.underline} Much of the existing work on NATO
and democratic development points to several avenues of possible
influence: socialization, [guidance from NATO about how to create and
implement reforms, NATO pressure to implement reforms, and legitimizing
new democracies by helping them provide the public good of security
through NATO membership. It is important to note that each of these
mechanisms for how [NATO could prompt reform]{.mark}]{.underline} should
begin operating before full NATO membership is achieved[.]{.underline}
Once prospective members are given a promise of membership in the form
of the MAP, they will be brought into close contact with NATO members
and therefore exposed to the socialization mechanism. If domestic reform
is a necessary condition for NATO membership, prospective members
participating in the MAP should begin reforming so that they can reap
the benefits of membership. Finally, if democratic reforms made to gain
NATO membership persist, NATO membership should also be associated with
higher levels of democracy in new member states. [Below we discuss each
of these means for NATO influence proposed in the
literature.]{.underline}

[First, [NATO]{.mark} may [have a]{.mark}]{.underline} subtle [[impact
on]{.mark}]{.underline} future [[member states by socializing military
and civilian leaders]{.mark} from states seeking membership [to respect
**democratic norms**]{.mark}**.** Democracy is dependent not only on the
formal institutions of a country, but also on whether elites are willing
to abide by democratic constraints on their power rather than undermine
or dismantle them.]{.underline} The example of Poland's recent
democratic backsliding despite the former presence of formal democratic
institutions illustrates this point[. Even when democratic reforms
preceded NATO involvement, [NATO]{.mark} could still have a
democratizing influence by [socializing military and civilian elites to
respect democratic reforms---particularly civilian control of the
military]{.mark}. NATO created the conditions for regular,
institutionalized interaction between elites from partner states and
longtime member states within the institutional framework of the
alliance and the Partnership for Peace (PfP), making socialization
possible. NATO taught military officers and civilian defense
policymakers who had served most of their professional lives under a
communist system about the norms of a democracy and their role in it
(Gheciu [2005b](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR24)).
This socialization logic outlined by Alexandra Gheciu and others is not
in conflict with our argument, as we measure changes in democratic
institutions rather than changes in elite attitudes.]{.underline}
However, recent democratic backsliding in some NATO countries indicates
that either the right elites were not socialized by NATO or the main
effect of NATO socialization was teaching elites to value civilian
control of the military and continued engagement with NATO.

Elite socialization began well before NATO membership, with collective
briefings, individualized MAPs for each prospective member state,
NATO-led workshops, military advisers from NATO member states, and
professional education programs
(Gheciu [2005b](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR24)).
NATO used these cooperative activities to teach the goals and norms of
the alliance and assess the commitment of PfP countries to them
(Gheciu [2005a](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR23)).
Joint military exercises, in addition to augmenting the capability
aggregation of the alliance, allowed military elites from NATO states
and prospective member states to interact. Military education
programs---such as the NATO Defence College and programs through partner
states such as the year-long International Fellows program at the US
National Defense University---played a similar role in building military
capability while creating space for socialization through
military-to-military interactions.

[Second, even [when countries intended to make democratic
reforms]{.mark} on their own initiative, [they]{.mark} often [lacked
institutional knowledge about how to reform]{.mark}. [NATO stepped in to
provide **assistance**]{.mark} and advice to prospective members
regarding how to enact democratic reforms. Democracy advising was
provided through the NATO Parliamentary Assembly and the associated
Rose-Roth seminars. According to Trine Flockhart
([2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR18)),
the NATO Parliamentary Assembly and Rose-Roth seminars brought together
parliamentarians from NATO and partner states to 'familiarize
legislators with key security issues and debates, to promote the
development of appropriate civil--military relations, and to facilitate
the sharing of expertise and experience in parliamentary practice and
procedures.' These seminars also played a 'very important social
function' as policymakers from NATO and partner countries built
professional networks with one another
(Flockhart [2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR18)).
Civilian defense policymakers and military officers from NATO partner
countries were also able to participate in the NATO-adjacent George C.
Marshall Center, which has over 13,300 alumni. Courses at the Marshall
Center include discussion of international law, democracy, rule of law,
and human rights alongside more traditional security topics (Marshall
Center [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR22)).]{.underline}

[Third, [NATO provided pressure for specific
reforms]{.mark}]{.underline} through direct communication with a
country's NATO liaisons and naming and shaming countries slacking on
reforms. For example, a US Congressional Research Service report
released in 1995 raised concerns that Poland was not ready for NATO
membership. The report stated: 'Initiation into NATO nevertheless may
hinge even more on publication of a democratic Constitution and the
legal basis for civilian control. Meanwhile, the Minister of Defense and
many senior officers who set policy and shape opinions have become mired
in political wrangling over control of the armed forces' (quoted in
Epstein [2005](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR15),
254--285). As Rachel Epstein notes, this report was widely publicized in
the Polish media with the effect of shaming Polish officials into
complying, given that NATO membership was by this time an established
national foreign policy goal. When the chief of the Polish General
Staff, General Tadeusz Wilecki, opposed increased civilian control of
the military, an unflattering New York Times article put sufficient
pressure on Polish president Aleksander Kwasniewski that he removed
Wilecki
(Epstein [2006](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR16),
280--281).

By utilizing naming and shaming tactics and building alliances with
pro-reform domestic politicians, NATO successfully shepherded a select
group of partner states through enacting civilian control of the
military and more internationalized defense policies
(Epstein [2005](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR15)).
Although Poland joined NATO in the 1999 wave of enlargement, one could
argue that the logic of pressure for reforms was still relevant for the
countries that joined NATO in 2004. The smaller reforms of hiring
personnel supportive of democratic norms and building political
coalitions in support of democracy that Epstein highlights are
consistent with what we find in our quantitative analysis. Some states
that rapidly enacted democratic reforms after transition to democracy in
the early 1990s made small improvements under NATO tutelage, even though
their average democracy scores after reaching NATO applicant status and
membership remained similar to what they had been before. Other
NATO-induced changes, such as the firing of Wilecki in Poland, may have
been crucial for continued progress even though our quantitative data do
not measure them. NATO's value, then, may be in encouraging states
already democratizing to persist in maintaining democracy despite
challenges from domestic elites. However, any democratizing effect of
NATO would be concentrated on the premembership period, as democracy is
in practice not a condition for remaining a NATO member.

[[Finally, NATO can assist in providing the public good of
security]{.mark}, [which can be **critical for the legitimacy of some
new democracies**]{.mark}. Poast and Urpelainen
([2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR49))
argue that [leaders in transitional democracies use]{.mark}, and often
must create, i[nternational organizations to consolidate democratic rule
and improve their ability to distribute public goods to the
populations]{.mark} under their rule. Public goods are broadly defined
as policies that benefit large constituencies in society. Examples of
public goods include internal and external security (Loader and
Walker [2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR40);
Bueno de Mesquita et
al. [1999](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR6)),
public infrastructure that increases investment
(Henisz [2002](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR29)),
free and fair elections
(Donno [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR14)),
reduction of corruption
(Banerjee [1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR2)),
and environmental protection (VanDeveer and
Dabelko [2001](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR55)).
Providing such goods is critical to the survival of leaders in
democratizing states.]{.underline} But because autocratic developing
countries have little need or capacity to improve the provision of
public goods (Bueno de Mesquita et
al. [2003](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR7);
Wintrobe [1998](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR59)),
democratization leaves leaders in newly democratic regimes with a unique
challenge; they face high expectations for public good provision, yet
their administrative apparatus has little experience providing public
goods (Haggard and
Kaufman [1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR28)).
[Therefore, [newly democratic governments can benefit from outside
expertise on public goods provision]{.mark}, namely that offered by
international organizations (IOs). IOs can assist democratizing states
in the provision of public goods. IOs provide a venue through which

[[The credibility of the Baltic states' democratic institutions]{.mark}
and democratic process were tied to providing the public good of
security through establishing and maintaining effective sovereignty.
This meant that preventing interference from Russia was critical to the
survival of Baltic democracy. Historically, the Baltics were classic
buffer states that had been repeatedly occupied and/or annexed by the
major European powers over the centuries
(Fazal [2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR17);
Snyder [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR53)).
But the governments of the Baltic states could not provide security from
their own resources. Indeed, the security forces of these states were
nonexistent. Kasekamp and Veebel
([2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR34),

had no military establishment or diplomatic service of their own during
the Cold War. These [had to be built]{.mark} from scratch in the 1990s.'

2), the former Latvian national security adviser, remarked in 1999 that,
upon gaining independence, the Latvian military had no military threat
analysis, defense concept, defense plan, or knowledge of budgetary
processes or force planning. Former Lithuanian defense minister Linas
Linkevičius labeled the status of the Lithuanian military 'a mess,'
while Danish defense minister Hans Haekkerup observed that the Baltic
states' officers would need substantial retraining, as their only
professional soldiers had been Soviet trained
(Ito [2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR31),
241--242). Furthermore, a 1993 report [by]{.mark} the International
Institute for Strategic Studies noted that progress in establishing
forces would be slow because of a lack of financial resources and
necessary expertise, a general reluctance to volunteer for service, and
the various exemptions from conscript service
(Rudzīte-Stejskala [2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR51),

Sir Garry Johnson remarked that the Baltic states 'started from zero'
(quoted in
Ito [2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR31),

[Security, in the view of the [Baltic states, could only be acquired
by]{.mark} foreign help, and this left just one option: the **[Western
democracies]{.mark}**. In fact, the Baltic states never considered
alternatives to seeking membership in Western institutions, **[namely
NATO]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [For example, Raivo Vare, the Estonian
state minister, asserted: 'The only real possibility is NATO' (quoted in
Lepik [2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR38),
164). NATO's PfP initiative was a useful first step in fulfilling the
needs of the Baltic states. PfP, approved by the existing NATO members
at the autumn 1993 NATO summit, allowed NATO to engage in peacekeeping
operations with Central and Eastern European countries. By the mid-1990s
the USA, sensing the need to craft a policy regarding the Baltic states,
devised the Baltic Action Plan (BAP), a three-track process for
integrating the Baltic states into the West: expand US-Baltic
cooperation, expand US-Nordic cooperation to assist the Baltics, and
expand US involvement in mediating Baltic-Russian differences. This was
followed by the creation of the MAP. When the first Eastern European
states (the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland) officially entered NATO
in 1999, the other NATO hopefuls embarked on the MAP. The MAP was a
series of workshops in which NATO staff offered advice, assistance, and
support for countries wishing to join NATO, and only a subgroup of PfP
members were invited to take part in the MAP. Indeed, whereas PfP
included countries as unlikely to join NATO as Russia (because of
historical animosity toward NATO) and Uzbekistan (because of geographic
location), embarking on the MAP meant that a country was now on a path
to membership. As one senior NATO adviser remarked, participating in the
MAP meant that 'there was an open door and it just seemed to make sense
to provide sensible advice' (quoted in
Rudzīte-Stejskala [2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00236-6#ref-CR51),
178--180). Critically for democratic development, this advising included
technical assistance in reforming civil--military relations and supreme
command of the military. In the specific case of the Baltic states,
setting out on a formal path to NATO membership also accorded their
democratic regimes legitimacy by enabling them to provide for the
external security of their states. In other [words, NATO offered
a]{.mark} security [umbrella **necessary** for democratic development to
endure]{.mark}]{.underline}

## Deterrence Theory Good

### General

#### Deterrence theory already considers possibilities of failure but still gives the logical conclusion that the aff is most likely to succeed -- critique of the theory only provides examples of instances where the theory failed, but fails to take down the logics of the theory -- it's a hasty generalization

Achen and Snidal 89 (Christopher H. and Duncan, professor of politics at
Princeton University, professor of international relations at Oxford
University, "Rational Deterrence Theory and Comparative Case Studies,"
1989,
https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/abs/rational-deterrence-theory-and-comparative-case-studies/05B3C8641D5EF6F9A36067EEA0210CCE#:\~:text=Several%20recent%20books%20have%20argued%20that%20comparative%20case,This%20paper%20shows%20that%20such%20contentions%20are%20unwarranted.)

Conversely, if a deterrable initiator believes that it would very likely
not be in the defender\'s interest to retaliate, or that the defender
lacks the means or the will to do so, the initiator will attack. Thus,
under conventional rational-choice assumptions, when the attacker is
deterrable, successful deterrence turns on the defender\'s credibility.
If the latter can convince the attacker that he has the political and
military ability to fight, and that the prize (or his reputation for
fighting when challenged) is worth more to him than the cost of the war,
then, and only then, will a deterrable initiator be deterred.24 This
simple model is less brittle than sometimes thought. Its propositions
are contingent: if the expected punishment exceeds the gain, then
opponents will be deterred. Thus, for example, the model implies that
some conceivable punishment would deter, but not that any particular one
will, nor even any feasible one. Put more strongly, the model implies
that deterrence will fail for sufficiently determined attackers. Not all
conceivable opponents are deterrable.25 [Critics of]{.mark} rational
[deterrence sometimes write as if failures of deterrence were equivalent
to failures of deterrence theory.]{.mark} Levy, for example, notes,
\"this is an ad hoc hypothesis which cannot technically be derived from
any formal theory of deterrence.\"26 [The truth is that the theory
actually predicts some breakdowns.]{.mark} [When deterrence
fails]{.mark} because the retaliatory threat is absent, incredible, or
less valuable than the prize, [the theory has forecast
perfectly]{.mark}. Rational deterrence theory implies that deterrence
will not always be successful. Rational deterrence is very much an
ideal-type explanation. No sensible person pretends that it summarizes
typical deterrence decision making well, or that it exhausts what is to
be said about any one historical case. Yet it has dominated discussion
in all traditions of deterrence research, including historical
investigations. For example, George and Smoke criticize rational
deterrence for its assumption that a government is a rational actor and
can be treated as if it were a single person.2 ? Yet the same authors
summarize their case-study evidence as follows: In almost every
historical case examined, [we found evidence that the initi-
ator]{.mark} tried to [satisfy himself]{.mark} before acting [that the
risks of the particular op- tion he chose could be calculated
and]{.mark}, perhaps more importantly, [con- trolled by him so as to
give his choice of action the character of a rationally calculated,
acceptable risk]{.mark}.28 [The]{.mark} rational unitary-actor [model is
not easily evaded]{.mark}. The power of rational deterrence theory is
conceptual, not mathematical. It derives from the underlying logical
cohesion and consistency with a set of simple first principles, not from
the particular language in which it is expressed. In consequence[, the
model has been astonishingly fecund; both for theory and for
policy]{.mark}. Its surprising implications, now familiar from the
literature, include \"the rationality of irrationality,\" the dangers of
total disarmament, and the value of aiming for strategic equivalence
between the superpowers.29 Perhaps most importantly, it was rational
deterrence theory that sensitized policy makers to the negative aspect
of defensive systems such as civil defense, the ABM, and SDI, which make
first strikes less dangerous. The point is strongly counterintuitive;
indeed, Aleksey Kosygin told Lyndon Johnson at Glassboro that he didn\'t
understand it.30 But this surprising conclusion is a clear implication
of rational deterrence theory. Contrary to George and Smoke\'s view,
[rational deterrence theory has proved itself in practical policy
applications. No other theoretical perspective has had nearly the impact
on American foreign policy]{.mark}, certainly not the conclusions of the
case-study literature. Far from being an abstract, deductivistic theory
developed in a policy vacuum, [rational deterrence theory has repeatedly
taken inspiration from the most pressing policy questions of the
day]{.mark}, from decisions of bomber-basing in the 1950s to SDI in the
1980s. It has set the terms of the debate, and has often influenced the
outcome. One may choose to applaud or decry its impact, but [one cannot
deny that the theory of rational deterrence, like any good theory, has
been of immense practical importance.]{.mark}

### AT Empirical Ev

#### Their empirical examples are only generalizations NOT reasons why deterrence theory in this instance fail -- that a misuse of their case studies 

Achen and Snidal 89 (Christopher H. and Duncan, professor of politics at
Princeton University, professor of international relations at Oxford
University, "Rational Deterrence Theory and Comparative Case Studies,"
1989,
https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/abs/rational-deterrence-theory-and-comparative-case-studies/05B3C8641D5EF6F9A36067EEA0210CCE#:\~:text=Several%20recent%20books%20have%20argued%20that%20comparative%20case,This%20paper%20shows%20that%20such%20contentions%20are%20unwarranted.)

[Analysts who employ case studies of deterrence]{.mark} have done well
at producing lists of variables that influence deterrence success, along
with certain empirical generalizations about how different types of
crises unfold. But they have [produced no impressive general
propositions to compare with those of rational deterrence. Case-study
generalizations are not a substitute for theorizing; empirical laws
should not be mistaken for theoretical propositions]{.mark}. More than
anything else, the hallmark of good theory is a fecundity that logically
entails novel,sometimes surprising, insights and predictions. Inductive
\"theory\" lacks this fecundity because it contains too few logical
constraints. Categories can be multiplied to fit all cases.
\"Surprises\" emerge not from the generalization, but from the case.
Hence, we often cannot tell a consequential finding from an artifact;
and when we succeed, the next case makes us begin all over again. By
contrast, [deductive theoretical propositions are of interest precisely
because they interconnect with one another and prevent arbitrary
multiplication of explanatory categories.]{.mark} The investigator is
forced to be coherent. Multiple case studies are also no substitute for
statistical testing of theoretical propositions; [contingent empirical
generalizations should not be confused with confirmed statistical
regularities]{.mark}. Here again, the informal procedures of case-study
analysis provide too few constraints on the imagination of the analyst.
In consequence, [empirical evidence from case studies is rarely strong
enough to falsify a theory. In the case-study]{.mark} literature on
deterrence, these [weaknesses have appeared]{.mark}, first, [in
selection bias]{.mark}---the tendency to oversample deterrence
failures---[and,]{.mark} second, [in the uncritical use of decision
makers\' own reconstructions of their thinking. Each of these virtually
guarantees a negative evaluation of rational deterrence theory, no
matter how well it actually performs]{.mark}. Only statistical analysis,
with its formal criteria for inference, is likely in practice to provide
honest tests of theories. Case studies are an important complement to
both theory-building and statistical investigations, for precisely the
reason Russett and George indicate: they allow a close examination of
historical sequences in the search for causal processes.79 The analyst
is able to identify plausible causal varw Russett (fn. 53); George (fn.
6). RATIONAL DETERRENCE: ACHEN & SNIDAL 169 iables, a task essential to
theory construction and testing. Comparison of historical cases to
theoretical predictions provides a sense of whether the theoretical
story is compelling, and yields indispensable prior knowledge for more
formal tests of explanatory adequacy. The method also generates novel
empirical generalizations, which pose puzzles and challenges for theory
to explain. In all these ways, case studies provide guidance in the
revision and reformulation of analytic theory to account for a broader
range of phenomena. Indeed, analytic theory cannot do without case
studies. Because they are simultaneously sensitive to data and theory,
case studies are more useful for these purposes than any other
methodological tool. [Too often]{.mark}, however, [their findings have
been interpreted as bodies of theory and tests of explanatory
power]{.mark}. It is to these misuses that our criticisms have been
directed.

## AT Verification Procedure Fail in Deterrence Theory

#### That's descriptivist fallacy -- deterrence theory doesn't have to prove that the decision maker's mental choices perfectly align, just that the consequences are aligned with the theory 

Achen and Snidal 89 (Christopher H. and Duncan, professor of politics at
Princeton University, professor of international relations at Oxford
University, "Rational Deterrence Theory and Comparative Case Studies,"
1989,
https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/abs/rational-deterrence-theory-and-comparative-case-studies/05B3C8641D5EF6F9A36067EEA0210CCE#:\~:text=Several%20recent%20books%20have%20argued%20that%20comparative%20case,This%20paper%20shows%20that%20such%20contentions%20are%20unwarranted.)

There is a second objection to the empirical testing of rational
deterrence in comparative case studies---namely, that the verification
procedure fails to engage the rational deterrence theory of how states
behave. In particular, rational deterrence is implicitly misconstrued as
a theory of how decision makers think. Case study analysts have often
expressed the opinion that, if decision makers do not really carry out
the appropriate mental calculations, rational deterrence theory does not
apply. [This argument is the \"descriptivist fallacy.\"]{.mark} As a
glance at any appropriate text will show, the axioms and conclusions of
utility theory refer only to choices. Mental calculations are never
mentioned: the theory makes no reference to them. Indeed, a major reason
for the various axiomatizations of expected-utility theory is to show
that decision makers need not calculate. If they simply respond to
incentives in certain natural ways, their behavior will be describable
by utility functions.65 Rapoport puts it this way: Now, in being asked
to choose between the two \[lottery\] tickets, the man is not asked to
calculate anything. He is asked simply to choose between the two. It is
from his choices that the theoretician will construct the man\'s util-
ity scale on which all the outcomes will be assigned numbers
(utilities).66 To our knowledge, no one who does rational-choice
theorizing disputes this point, but it seems not to be widely
understood. Rational deterrence theory does contain some minimal
psychological content: for example, the initiator must realize that the
defender exists and threatens to defend. But rational deterrence is
agnostic about the actual calculations decision makers undertake. It
holds that they will act as if they solved certain mathematical
problems, whether or not they actually solve them. Just as Steffi Graf
plays tennis as if she did rapid computations in Newtonian physics (and
in game theory, too---at least against Navratilova), so rational
deterrence theory predicts that decision makers will decide whether to
go to war as if they did expected-utility calculations. But they need
not actually perform them.67 To avoid misunderstandings, we want to
point out that our point here has nothing to do with Friedman\'s famous
argument that the truth of assumptions need not matter.68 Friedman
maintained that a theory might sometimes work well for certain purposes,
even though its assumptions were known to be false. We have our doubts;
but whatever its merits, this line of reasoning has no bearing on our
argument. Our point is that [even if decision makers do not actually
calculate, or if they rationalize their actions after the fact with
foolish calculations, the assumptions of rational choice theory may yet
remain true.]{.mark} Understanding what rational deterrence demands of
decision makers is important because it sharply limits what counts
against the theory[. A proper understanding of the theory eliminates
most of the arguments in the historical deterrence literature that are
supposed to overturn it. Consider,]{.mark} for example, [the fact that
many decision makers do not seem to think in terms of probabilities at
all.]{.mark} This point is made by Steinbruner with respect to
Kennedy\'s remark that he faced certain impeachment if he did nothing
about the Cuban missiles;69 Stein has made it in connection with Anwar
Sadat\'s forecasts of various foreign policy consequences, for Egypt in
the early 1970s.70 Both authors maintain that, because each decision
maker failed to discuss probabilities in situations where rational
deterrence theory implies he should, rational deterrence is inaccurate
in describing what happened. Related arguments have been advanced by
Jervis and by Betts.7 \' These conclusions do not follow. [Let us repeat
that rational deterrence theory deals with choices, not mental
calculations. It makes no predictions about what decision makers say
influenced them, only about what actually did so]{.mark}. The
distinction is particularly important in the case of postdecision
reconstructions. As diplomatic historians have long been aware, the
historical record often differs sharply from decision makers\' memories,
even memories about their own thoughts at the time.72 Since the critics
of deterrence wish to adduce evidence that is not only dubious but
apparently irrelevant to the theory under discussion, they bear the
burden of proof. They must show that no plausible psychological
mechanisms could have introduced a gap between the reality and the
reconstruction, and they must demonstrate that what decision makers say
influenced them is identical with what actually happened. Neither Stein
nor Steinbruner have made such a case. Indeed, several plausible
psychological mechanisms would render their evidence
irrelevant---mechanisms of the sort that they and others have often put
forward as key factors in international decision making. Suppose, then,
that decision makers actually behave according to rational-choice
theory. Indeed, no matter what he said, it is hard to believe that
Kennedy\'s Cubanmissile decisions were unaffected by the difference
between a.possibility of impeachment, a livelihood of impeachment, and a
certainty of impeachment. But suppose that, like the rest of us, Kennedy
subsequently bolstered his decision by thinking and saying that any
other choice would have brought on unpleasant political consequences
with certainty. If so, he would speak in the apparently nonrational
language that he actually used, but his behavior would be predicted
perfectly by rationality assumptions. Obvious competing interpretations
like this one have not been excluded by the critics of rational
deterrence. It is not easy to do so. Indeed, no matter how detailed the
historical records, disagreements break out routinely over
interpretations of decision makers\' thoughts and intentions.73 The
degree of uncertainty in historical interpretations of motive and
intention is often substantial, and conclusions deriving from such
interpretations must be discounted appropriately. Yet case-study
analysts usually provide no assessment of the reliability of their
historical judgments. In particular, without a detailed showing that the
questionable memories of decision makers represent the historical
process accurately, no amount of evidence about their apparent
calculation errors is relevant to the issue of whether rational
deterrence theory predicts decision making.\^ In the absence of such a
showing, rational deterrence theory stands unrebutted.75 It is not our
central point here to set out one particular list of inferential slips
by case-study analysts. After all, one can imagine case studies that
select cases in a nonprejudicial fashion, and that take proper account
of the fallibility in assessments of decision makers\' intentions.
Well-designed case-study tests may not be decisive, but they can be
highly enlightening and strongly persuasive.?6 They are certainly an
indispensable first step before proceeding to statistical methods---a
point quantitative researchers have too often ignored at their peril. In
principle, case studies are capable of doing everything statistical
analysis can do; they may simply replace symbols with words and
replicate the random samples, precise definitions, and rigorous
inferences of statistical methods. But in practice, inferential rigor is
not the best tool for what case studies should accomplish, and the
comparative method works best when it enforces no such discipline. As
Jack Snyder notes, \"The best analysts in the \[case study\] field have
always used a rough-and-ready version of the scientific method,\" which
they have identified, not with the powerful counterintuitive logic of
the real McCoy, but rather with the substantially tamer
\"self-conscious, systematic application of commonsense rules of
inference.\"77 When the purposes of comparative case studies are
properly understood, informality is the right choice. Creativity is
enhanced when historical cases can be chosen at liberty and analyzed in
accord with the investigator\'s intuitions. The great many degrees of
freedom in these studies are inordinately helpful in finding useful
variables and producing empirical generalizations. Like all good things,
however, this free play for unaided common sense has a price. Used in
isolation from scientific methods, it creates inevitable inferential
errors and makes decisive theory verification well-nigh impossible. In
case studies of rational deterrence, the consequences have been both
predictable and devastating for the credibility of their conclusions

## AT: Root Case -- War

#### War is caused by leadership succession, democracy necessary to curtail

Chares **Lipson**, 20**13**. Leadership Succession as a Cause of War:
The Structural Advantage of Democracies. Princeton: Princeton University
Press, pp. 112--38, doi:10.1515/9781400850723.112.

The last chapter dealt  with all four  sources of the  democratic
contracting advantage: transparency, audience costs, constitutionalism,
and continuity of regimes. This chapter continues the examination of
regime continuity, focusing on leadership succession. **Succession
crises are a frequent source of wars**. **Democracies are systematically
better at averting** them and, hence, at averting the **wars** that stem
from them. Because democracies have solved the succession problem
internally, they avoid its most dangerous consequences externally. My
main point, however, is not simply that succession crises produce wars.
They obviously do. My aim is to show how they block the path to peace,
mainly by creating vast uncertainties and obstructing long-term bargains
that could prevent war.

#### The aff uses *perfect deterrence theory,* that can enable demilitarization AND strengthening security.

[Perfect Deterrence Theory has been developed as an alternative to
classical deterrence theory]{.underline}. We have become interested in
the theory as it seems to be aesthetically more appealing than classical
deterrence theory. [It provides another way of looking at deterrence
but, this time, without its internal structure plagued by logical
inconsistency.]{.underline} As Frank Zagare & Kilgour, the creators of
Perfect Deterrence Theory, explain in their co-authored book 'Perfect
Deterrence,'3 classical deterrence theory suffers from what is known as
the paradox of mutual deterrence. [Classical deterrence e theory hinges
on the fact that the status quo is reinforced as the cost of conflict
becomes higher.]{.underline} However, logic dictates that the status quo
is not a rational choice when both States (A & B) prefer capitulation to
conflict when challenged. The status quo is not a Nash equilibrium7 in
the standard 2 x 2 game of Chicken in which there are four outcomes
(i.e., A wins, B wins, status quo and conflict). [The game of Chicken
was a tool favored by classical deterrence theorists as it captured
essential aspects of deterrence during the age of nuclear confrontation
between the United States and the Soviet Union, as it was then. In this
game, conflict is understandably assumed to be the worst choice and,
hence, the contradiction ensues. The proponents of classical deterrence
theory are yet to provide a satisfactory resolution to this logical
inconsistency although various attempts have been made.8 Perfect
Deterrence Theory was also developed to overcome the empirical
deficiencies of classical deterrence theory.]{.underline} Zagare &
Kilgour point out that the 'power imbalance' is a poor indicator for
measuring the likelihood of war as there have been many instances of war
fought between two states with roughly equal power, World War II between
Britain and Germany for one. [There is little empirical support for
associating the power imbalance with the likelihood of war. It is a
prerequisite that a good theory must stand up reasonably well to
empirical evidence. Overall, Perfect Deterrence Theory's predictions are
more in agreement with empirical findings. Here are some distinguishing
features of Perfect Deterrence Theory. As explained, in classical
deterrence theory, the cost of conflict plays a 'central' role in
deterring an adversary. Hence, it makes a perfect sense for a state to
stock up on more powerful weapons to deter the adversary. These weapons
will unleash more destructive power, thereby significantly raising the
cost of conflict which, in turn, reduces the possibility of
conflict]{.underline}.9 [Any adversary would think twice before
challenging to upset the status quo]{.underline}. [However,]{.underline}
as Zagare & Kilgour point out, [this model of deterrence is deficient in
the sense that there is no maximum limit on the cost of conflict (i.e.,
that is, a state should just keep on accumulating stockpiles of ever
more destructive weapons as long as it can monetarily afford them).
There is no built-in mechanism within the model that provides the
maximum limit. Such a limit can be shown to exist inherently in some
models of Perfect Deterrence Theory, beyond which further strengthening
of deterrence becomes totally redundant (i.e., making a case for minimum
deterrence). This is a desirable feature to have in the model of
deterrence]{.underline}. [The theory also gives due consideration to the
importance of maintaining the 'status quo' which is somehow neglected in
the past. The status quo did not receive much attention, as the focus
was heavily on the cost of conflict.]{.underline} The emphasis was on
the punishment side. Moreover, States A and B no longer have to be
undifferentiated in the theory. If needed, one state can be specifically
designated as challenger determined to upset the status quo while the
other state, as defender, is determined to keep the status quo. [This
will better approximate a realworld situation. 'Capability' and
'credibility' are two critical variables in the analysis of a deterrence
situation. In Perfect Deterrence Theory, capability is defined as one's
ability to hurt the other (i.e., adversary) while credibility is defined
in terms of one's willingness to fight rather than
capitulate.]{.underline} These variables together with other utility
variables (e.g., a utility for A wins, B wins, Status Quo and Conflict)
are used to determine rational choices and the conditions under which
those choices exist. These conditions usually take the form of
mathematical inequalities and many insights are gained through analyzing
these inequalities. At some decision points in the game (or tree),10 it
may be necessary that States A and B update their belief about the
other's determination to fight rather than capitulate based on
conditional probability.11 Zagare & Kilgour provide all mathematical
details in the appendix section of their book.3, 12 Their work is firmly
founded on logic and, hence, model predictions are the direct
consequences of a rational decision-making process. In practice,
rational choices are nothing but Nash equilibria. Determining these
choices simply amounts to finding Nash equilibria. [There can be more
than one Nash equilibrium under a given condition, which is perhaps a
less desirable feature of the theory as it loses
predictability.]{.underline} It is simply not possible to know which
course of action will be taken in a situation with multiple Nash
equilibria.13 Hence, multiple equilibria may be able to explain the
success or failure of a deterrence situation that has occurred in the
past. One can only hypothesize which one might have been in play. In the
theory, only a Nash equilibrium that fulfills Selten's 'Perfectness'
condition (i.e., being subgame-perfect) is thought to be a 'rational'
choice. [This condition is used to eliminate all choices which have at
least one incredible (a technical term as explained later) decision made
along the decision path. Only subgame-perfect Nash equilibria are of
true interest as they are free of irrationalities. Accordingly, Zagare &
Kilgour have named their deterrence theory with this game theory term
'Perfect' in front. It does not mean 'Perfect Deterrence' in the
ordinary sense of 'perfect,' as such deterrence has never existed and
never will.]{.underline} Perfect Deterrence Theory has been specifically
chosen to be the basis of our study for these reasons. We sought to draw
out valuable implications for South Korea based on Zagare & Kilgour's
findings.[3 Basically, what can this deterrence theory tell us about
strengthening **the security** of South Korea and continuing to preserve
peace and stability in the face of North Korea's growing nuclear
threat?]{.underline} In the next chapter, basic concepts in Perfect
Deterrence Theory are reviewed.

#### Perfect deterrence theory is accurate and robust.

**Quackenbush 10**. Stephen L. Quackenbush is Associate Professor of
Political Science at the University of Missouri. He received his PhD in
2003 from the University at Buffalo, SUNY.** **Stephen L.

The specific purpose is to fill this evidentiary gap by subjecting
perfect deterrence theory---a recently developed theory of general
deterrence---to a systematic test. I do so for several reasons. First[,
perfect deterrence theory]{.underline} (Zagare and Kilgour 2000[) is
supported by a **formal logic** with explicit theoretical expectations
that facilitates empirical testing]{.underline}.
Second, [several preliminary tests of perfect deterrence theory have
rendered promising]{.underline}, albeit provisional results (Senese and
Quackenbush 2003; Quackenbush and Zagare 2006).1 And finally, as Huth
(1999) points out, standard formulations of deterrence---to the extent
that they have been explored empirically---are without compelling
support. [Perfect deterrence theory is an axiomatically distinct
theoretical alternative to classical deterrence theory, which focuses on
ideas such as brinkmanship and mutual assured
destruction]{.underline}. [Perfect deterrence theory highlights the
importance of two variables: capability and credibility.]{.underline} [A
state's threat is capable if the threatened party believes that it would
be worse off if the threat were carried out than if it were not. For
example, if Defender has a capable threat, then Challenger prefers
Status Quo to Conflict. One additional equilibrium---Steadfast
Deterrence Equilibrium---exists. As with the Certain Deterrence
Equilibrium, Status Quo is the only possible outcome]{.underline}.
However, [this equilibrium exists at intermediate and **high values of
Defender credibility**]{.underline}, and thus coexists with equilibria
of other types. Therefore, through the Steadfast Deterrence
Equilibrium, [perfect deterrence theory predicts that the Status Quo is
always possible as long as Defender's threat is capable]{.underline}.
Thus, Zagare and Kilgour's (2000:149) claim that successful "[deterrence
could conceivably emerge under (almost) any conditions in a one-sided
deterrence relationship]{.underline}." hese independent variables
constitute the equilibrium outcome predictions of perfect deterrence
theory. However, a number of alternative explanations of international
behavior exist. Therefore, several control variables, representing the
major foci of recent conflict studies, are used to test the robustness
of the results obtained. Some of these variables (particularly relative
power and S score) are components of the utility functions that form the
basis of the equilibrium predictions to be tested. However, it is
possible that these variables exert an independent influence on
deterrence outcomes in addition to their influence on equilibrium
predictions. Furthermore, since these individual components are combined
in a different, nonlinear fashion within the unilateral deterrence game
to generate equilibrium predictions, multicollinearity between the
equilibrium predictions and the control variables is not present.16 To
examine the robustness of these results against alternative
explanations, the full multinomial logit model was run including the
control variables. The full model, shown in Table 3, produces a highly
significant fit to the data. The results of the full model indicate that
the predictions of perfect deterrence theory are quite robust.
Therefore, perfect deterrence theory's predictions of Status Quo,
Defender Concedes, Challenger Defeated, and Conflict are all strongly
supported by the empirical record, and these predictions are robust
against alternative explanations. Thus[, perfect deterrence theory
provides a proportional reduction in the error of non-status quo
predictions of 20 percent. Although improvement is always possible,
these results nonetheless support perfect deterrence
theory]{.underline}.

[Our [defense science and technology investment enables]{.mark} [us to
counter military threats]{.mark} and to overcome any advantages that
adversaries may seek. It also [expands the military options available to
policymakers, including options other than warfare in pursuing the
objectives of promoting stability and preventing
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. Science and technology [[help to
**counter special threats such as terrorism**]{.underline}]{.mark} that
cannot be met by conventional warfighting forces, and they underpin the
intelligence capabilities necessary to assess the dangers our nation
faces. The U.S. military also relies on science and technology to make
our advanced military systems more affordable through their entire life
cycle. [And by maintaining a close dialogue with the warfighters, the
defense S&T community not only remains sensitive to user needs but also
sensitizes the user to the possibilities that technology offers for
responding to evolving threats. [U.S. military capabilities]{.mark} not
only [protect the United States and its citizens from direct threats,
they]{.mark} also [help maintain peace and stability in regions critical
to U.S. interests]{.mark} and underwrite U.S. defense commitments around
the world]{.underline}. Maintaining a strong defense capability means
that the U.S. Armed Forces, and the Department of Defense more broadly,
must be prepared to conduct the following kinds of missions, as
described in the President\'s national security strategy: [[Deterring
and defeating aggression in major regional conflicts. U.S. forces must
be capable of offsetting the military power]{.mark} of regional states
with interests opposed to those of the United States and its allies. To
do this, the United States must be able to deter and, if necessary,
defeat aggression, in concert with regional allies, by projecting and
sustaining U.S. power in two major regional conflicts that occur nearly
simultaneously.]{.underline} Providing credible overseas presence. [Some
U.S. forces must be forward deployed or stationed in key overseas
regions in peacetime. These [deployments contribute to a more **stable
and** **secure** international environment]{.mark} by demonstrating U.S.
commitment, deterring aggression, and underwriting important bilateral
and multilateral security relationships]{.underline}. Forward stationing
and periodic deployments also permit U.S. forces to gain familiarity
with overseas operating environments, promote joint and combined
training among friendly forces, improve interoperability with friendly
forces throughout the world, and respond in a timely manner to crises.
Conducting contingency operations. The United States must be prepared to
undertake a wide range of contingency operations in support of U.S.
interests. These operations include smaller-scale combat operations,
multilateral peace operations, noncombatant evacuations,
counterterrorism activities, and humanitarian and disaster relief
operations. [Countering weapons of mass destruction. While the United
States is redoubling its efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction and associated missile delivery systems, we must at
the same time improve our military capabilities to deter and prevent the
effective use of these weapons]{.underline}. We are pursuing this
objective by sustaining adequate retaliatory capabilities and by
increasing our capabilities to defend against weapons of mass
destruction, to locate and neutralize or destroy them before they are
used during a conflict, and to fight in an environment in which such
weapons have been used. Finally, to meet all these requirements
successfully, U.S. forces must be capable of responding quickly and
operating effectively across a wide range of environments. That is, they
must be ready to fight. Such high combat readiness demands well
qualified and motivated people; adequate amounts of modern,
well-maintained equipment; realistic training; strategic mobility; and
sufficient support and sustainment capabilities.

## Alt fails

### Empirics

#### Alt fails -- US Military isn't perfect but Obama admin proves demilitarization is impossible 

John R. **Deni**, 10-30-20**15**, \"Obama's Failure to Demilitarize U.S.
Foreign Policy,\" War on the Rocks,
https://warontherocks.com/2015/10/obamas-failure-to-demilitarize-u-s-foreign-policy/Dr.
John R. Deni is a Research Professor of Security Studies at the Army War
College's Strategic Studies Institute.//CDMoney

The [Obama administration]{.underline} has [received much attention for
its policy of rebalancing to]{.underline} the [Asia-Pacific]{.underline}
region. The rebalance has been described as President Obama's signature
foreign policy initiative. Launched in 2009, it has received much
attention from academics, practitioners, think tanks, and the media. In
reality, the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific has been more evolutionary
than revolutionary; a U.S. shift in focus and grand strategy began well
before President Obama's inauguration in January 2009. If the Obama
presidency in fact initiated a revolutionary rebalancing, it [was his
effort to rebalance American foreign policy generally from over-reliance
on the military and toward greater reliance on diplomacy and
development.]{.underline} Despite a concerted effort, [when viewed
through several lenses it **seems clear that demilitarization has
failed** **and U.S. foreign policy remains very, perhaps overly,
militarized.**]{.underline} As a result, the Pentagon can expect to be
handed messy military operations short of inter-state war that it may
not be prepared, equipped, or organized to handle efficiently or
effectively. In the 2008 presidential campaign, candidate Barack Obama
pledged to correct what he perceived as a fundamental imbalance between
the three-legged stool that comprises U.S. foreign policy ­--- defense,
diplomacy, and development --- through such measures as expanding the
State Department's Foreign Service. Once in office, the Obama
administration expressed its intent to rebalance away from defense and
toward diplomacy and development though a variety of strategies as well
as policy statements. Most recently, the 2015 National Security Strategy
explicitly notes that military force is not the sole means of achieving
U.S. national security objectives, arguing, "our first line of action is
principled and clear-eyed diplomacy, combined with the central role of
development in the forward defense and promotion of America's
interests." In addition to published strategies and policy
pronouncements, the Obama administration repeatedly emphasized diplomacy
and development in policy implementation over, or instead of,
large-scale military measures. Across a number of issues, the
administration has sought to rely less on overwhelming American military
power to accomplish foreign policy objectives. A short list of examples
could include maintaining drawdown timelines in Iraq and (with some
modification) in Afghanistan, "leading from behind" in Libya, nuclear
negotiations with Iran, and relying on sanctions to pressure Russia's
withdrawal from Ukraine. [Relying on diplomatic, political, and
development-based solutions typically takes time to bear fruit. In
contrast, wielding military force often yields results more quickly,
even if the apparent success is illusory in the long run.]{.underline}
Critics of the [Obama approach conflate the emphasis on diplomacy with
indecision, and hence weakness.]{.underline} However, the tragedy of
President [Obama's rebalance toward diplomacy and development is not
that it represents an America in retreat, but rather that the rebalance
has not succeeded in demilitarizing U.S. foreign policy,]{.underline} as
seen in three separate contexts. [First, available fiscal data show the
continuing dominance of defense spending relative to international
affairs spending.]{.underline} [Even under sequestration scenarios, that
budget will continue to dwarf the amount of money spent on diplomacy and
development.]{.underline} [Second, despite congressional concerns about
the risks of granting the Department of Defense increased authority in
security cooperation, Congress continues to do just that. The Department
of Defense continues to expand its activities into areas over which the
State Department previously had purview. Finally]{.underline}, based on
several examples over the last two decades or more, many experts,
practitioners, and observers have concluded that the [**civilian
instruments of American foreign policy** simply **lack** the capacity
and **capability to handle the complex, large-scale challenges facing
U.S. national security.**]{.underline} In particular, the challenge of
failed or failing states has laid bare Washington's inability to
implement so-called "whole of government" solutions. As a result, the
Department of Defense continues to be the problem-solving agency of
choice for legislators as well as those in the executive branch. The
[implications of a continued militarization of American foreign policy
are significant, most consequentially for the U.S.
military.]{.underline} Despite political intent and rhetoric, the
[Department of Defense is very likely to be relied upon again and again
to achieve national security objectives, both within and outside its
particular areas of competence. As such, it should take some preparatory
steps. First, the **military** services should **make a more holistic**,
institutional **commitment to embrace security cooperation** as a core
mission. **There is** some **evidence that this is
underway**,]{.underline} but there is much room for improvement,
especially in terms of doctrine, acquisition, and personnel policies.
Second, the military needs to improve its ability to assess whether and
where security cooperation tools are likely to be successful. All too
often, the U.S. military becomes a captive of its "can-do" attitude,
despite what seem like obvious and insurmountable challenges in
hindsight. Finally, if the best military advice is ignored by senior
policymakers on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, the Department of
Defense needs to recognize and prepare for "muddling through" missions
it may only have a small chance of achieving. Hence, the U.S. military
must prepare for a future not terribly unlike the very recent past,
characterized by messy stability operations, hybrid warfare, and
disorder short of major interstate war.

### Russia 

#### Alt is a romanticized pipe dream of demilitarization -- Ukraine proves Russia will take advantage

**Broad, 22** (William J. Broad, 2-5-2022, accessed on 7-20-2022, The
New York Times, \"Ukraine Gave Up Nuclear Weapons 30 Years Ago. Today
There Are Regrets.\",
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/05/science/ukraine-nuclear-weapons.html)

[At the end of the Cold War, the **[third largest nuclear power]{.mark}
on earth [was]{.mark}** not Britain, France or China. It was
**[Ukraine]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The Soviet collapse, a slow-motion
downfall that culminated in December 1991, resulted in the newly
independent Ukraine inheriting roughly 5,000 nuclear arms that Moscow
had stationed on its soil. Underground silos on its military bases held
long-range missiles that carried up to 10 thermonuclear warheads, each
far stronger than the bomb that leveled Hiroshima. [Only Russia and the
United States had more weapons. **The [removal of]{.mark} this [arsenal
often]{.mark} [gets hailed as]{.mark} a [triumph]{.mark} of arms
control.** Diplomats and peace activists cast Ukraine as a model citizen
in a world of would-be nuclear powers. But **[history shows]{.mark}**
the **[denuclearization to have been]{.mark} a [chaotic upheaval]{.mark}
that [shook with infighting, reversals and discord am]{.mark}ong the
[country's government and military.]{.mark}**]{.underline} At the time,
both Ukrainian and American [experts questioned the wisdom of atomic
disarmament. The **[deadly weapons]{.mark}**, some argued,
**[were]{.mark} the [only reliable means of deterring Russian
aggression]{.mark}**. Today Ukraine has no easy path to producing or
acquiring the materials to build a bomb.]{.underline} Even so, the
nuclear genie is once again stirring as Russian troops encircle the
nation and wage a shadow war in its easternmost provinces. ["**[We gave
away]{.mark} the [capability for nothing]{.mark}**," said Andriy
Zahorodniuk, a former defense minister of Ukraine.]{.underline}
Referring to the security assurances Ukraine won in exchange for its
nuclear arms, he added: "Now, every time somebody offers us to sign a
strip of paper, the response is, 'Thank you very much. We already had
one of those some time ago.'" Western analysts say the current Ukrainian
mood tends to romanticize the atomic past. "The gist is, 'We had the
weapons, gave them up and now look what's happening,'" said Mariana
Budjeryn, a Ukraine specialist at Harvard University. "On a policy
level, I see no movement toward any kind of reconsideration. But on a
popular level, that's the narrative." ["Regret is part of it," Dr.
Budjeryn, a Ukrainian native, added in an interview. "The other part is
whatever one feels as a result of being subjected to
injustice."]{.underline} At first, Ukraine rushed to get the Soviet arms
off its soil. Bombs, artillery shells, land mines and the relatively
small warheads atop short-range missiles were the easiest to relocate
and most likely to fall into unfriendly hands. More difficult to move
were the long-range missiles, which could weigh 100 tons and rise to a
height of nearly 90 feet. In January 1992, a month after the Soviet
Union ceased to exist, Ukraine's president and defense minister ordered
military commanders and their men to pledge loyalty to the new country
--- a move that would exert administrative control over the remaining
arms. Many refused, and the soldiers who managed Ukraine's nuclear
forces fell into a period of tense bewilderment over the fate of the
arsenal and its operational status. [**[Volodymyr Tolubko]{.mark}**, a
former nuclear-base commander who had been elected to the Ukrainian
Parliament, **[argued]{.mark} that** Kyiv should never give up its
atomic edge. In April 1992, he told the assembly that **[it was
"romantic and premature" for Ukraine to declare itself]{.mark} a
[nonnuclear]{.mark} state** and insisted that it should retain at least
some of its long-range warheads. **A [residual missile force]{.mark}, he
declared, [would]{.mark} be enough to "[deter any
aggressor]{.mark}."**]{.underline} While his stance never gained wide
support, "it compounded existing tensions," according to a detailed
history of Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. In the summer of 1993, John J.
Mearsheimer, a prominent international relations theorist at the
University of Chicago who was no stranger to controversy, lent his voice
to the issue of atomic retention. He argued in Foreign Affairs that a
nuclear arsenal was "imperative" if Ukraine was "to maintain peace." The
deterrent, he added, would ensure that the Russians, "who have a history
of bad relations with Ukraine, do not move to reconquer it." In Kyiv,
the government in 1993 went so far as to consider seizing operational
control of its nuclear missiles and bombers. But that never came to
pass. Instead, Ukraine punted. It demanded that, in exchange for nuclear
disarmament, it would need ironclad security guarantees. That was the
heart of the agreement signed in Moscow early in 1994 by Russia, Ukraine
and the United States. In late 1994, the pledges got fleshed out. [The
accord, known as **the [Budapest Memorandum, signed by Russia]{.mark},
Ukraine, Britain and the United States, [promised that none of]{.mark}
the [nations would use force]{.mark} or threats [against Ukraine and all
would respect its sovereignty]{.mark} and existing borders. The
agreement also [vowed]{.mark} that, [if aggression took place]{.mark},
the [signatories would seek]{.mark} [immediate action]{.mark} from the
United Nations Security Council [to aid Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
While Kyiv had failed to get what it wanted --- the kind of legally
binding guarantees that would come with a formal treaty ratified by the
U.S. Senate --- it received assurances that Washington would take its
political commitments as seriously as its legal obligations, according
to Dr. Budjeryn, a research analyst at the Managing the Atom project at
Harvard's Kennedy School[. In May 1996, Ukraine saw the last of its
nuclear arms transported back to Russia]{.underline}. The repatriations
had taken a half decade. What undid the diplomatic feat was the
"collective failure" of Washington and Kyiv to take into account the
rise of someone like Vladimir V. Putin, Steven Pifer, a negotiator of
the Budapest Memorandum and a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine now at
Stanford University, said in an interview. After Russian troops invaded
Crimea in early 2014 and stepped up a proxy war in eastern Ukraine, Mr.
Putin dismissed the Budapest accord as null and void. "They've been
fighting a low-grade war for eight years," Mr. Pifer, who just returned
from Kyiv, said of the Ukrainians. "You can't find bullets in the
stores. A lot of civilians are arming up." In Ukraine, the Crimean
invasion and the lengthy war led to a series of calls for atomic
rearmament, according to Dr. Budjeryn, author of "Inheriting the Bomb,"
a forthcoming book from Johns Hopkins University Press. In March 2014,
[**[Volodymyr Ohryzko]{.mark}**, a former foreign minister,
**[argued]{.mark} that [Ukraine]{.mark} now [had]{.mark} the [moral and
legal right to reestablish]{.mark} its [nuclear status]{.mark}**. In
July, an ultranationalist parliamentary bloc introduced a bill for
arsenal reacquisition. Later that year, a poll showed that **[public
approval stood at]{.mark}** nearly **[50 percent for]{.mark} [nuclear
rearmament]{.mark}**. Last year, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy
Melnyk, said **Kyiv might look to nuclear arms if it cannot become a
member of NATO. ["How else can we guarantee our defense?"]{.mark}** Mr.
Melnyk asked]{.underline}.

### T/ -- Demil esc

#### Demilitarization decks deterrence theory, which guarantees escalation

**Mazarr 20** (Michael Mazarr, Senior Political Scientist and Researcher
at RAND Corporation, 12-3-2020, accessed on 7-20-2022, NL ARMS
Netherlands Annual Review of Military Studies 2020: Deterrence in the
21st Century---Insights from Theory and Practice, \"Three Fundamental
Conditions for Successful Deterrence\", )

Much of [**[classic deterrence theory can be boiled down to]{.mark} a
simple proposition: The [potential aggressor]{.mark} [must
believe]{.mark} that the [defender has]{.mark} the [capability]{.mark}
and will [to do what it threatens]{.mark}**.36 This criterion is, again,
perceptual: The question is not whether the defender actually has such
capabilities or will, it is whether the aggressor believes that it
does.]{.underline} [**[Deterrence depends on]{.mark} the [perception
of]{.mark} the "[threatener's determination to fulfil the threat]{.mark}
if need be"---[and]{.mark}, more importantly, on the potential
[aggressor's "conviction]{.mark} that the [threat will be carried
out]{.mark}"**. 37 **[Deterrence fails]{.mark}, Bruce Russett concludes,
"[when]{.mark} the [attacker decides]{.mark} that the defender's [threat
is]{.mark} not likely [to be fulfilled]{.mark}.**"]{.underline} 38 This
axiom highlights two distinct factors---capability and will. Perceived
weakness in either can undermine deterrence. Capability is
straightforward enough. As suggested earlier, the immediate, local
balance of forces is not always a key determinant of deterrence
success---but **[a defender's broadly perceived suite of capabilities,
military and otherwise, must be strong enough to convince a potential
attacker that it is likely to pay a heavy price for
aggression.]{.underline}** Will is a much more abstract variable and
easily subject to misperception. Aggressors have repeatedly convinced
themselves that a defender did not have the will to respond, especially
in cases of extended deterrence. Will is partly a function of the
national interests involved: If a defender is seen to have vital
interests at stake, a potential attacker will believe threats of
response. **[[Aggressors can]{.mark} try to [undermine]{.mark} a
[defender's willingness to respond by]{.mark} using "[salami slicing"
approaches---]{.mark}using a [long series of low-level]{.mark}
[aggressions to change]{.mark} the [facts on]{.mark} the [ground
]{.mark}]{.underline}**without ever taking action that would justify a
major response. [Such strategies are designed to put the defender in a
dilemma: It cannot respond to every small violation, but if it does not
begin to punish minor transgressions, its strategic position will erode
over time. The United States confronts this challenge with Chinese and
Russian grey-zone campaigns today.]{.underline}

#### NATO is key to global peace -- demilitarization would cause China & Russia escalation

**Binnendijk, 19** (Hans Binnendijk, 3-19-2019, accessed on 7-20-2022,
Defense News, \"5 consequences of a life without NATO\",
https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/03/19/5-consequences-of-a-life-without-nato/)

[**The [most catastrophic impact of NATO's retirement would be]{.mark}**
the risk of **[Russian aggression and miscalculation]{.mark}.**
**[Without]{.mark} a clear [commitment to defend allied
territory]{.mark} backed up [by]{.mark} an [American nuclear
deterrent,]{.mark} President Vladimir [Putin will]{.mark}** certainly
**[see opportunities to seize land]{.mark}** he believes is Russian. He
has already done this in Georgia and Ukraine. Had they not joined NATO,
the Baltic states would probably already be occupied by Russian
troops.]{.underline} Certainly Putin would also see an opportunity to
seize more of Ukraine without the "shadow" of NATO to protect it.
[History teaches us that [**major wars start** **when aggressive leaders
miscalculate**]{.mark}. German leader Adolf **[Hitler attacked
Poland]{.mark} in 1939, [believing]{.mark}** that after then-British
Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's Munich Agreement**, [England would
be unlikely to respond]{.mark}. [North Korea attacked South
Korea]{.mark} in 1950 [after]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[appeared to remove Seoul from]{.mark} its [defensive
perimeter]{.mark}**. Iraqi leader **[Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait]{.mark} in 1990, [believing]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates** had signaled that it **[would not respond]{.mark}**.
In each case, miscalculation led to larger conflict.]{.underline}
Secondly, NATO's retirement would also decrease American military reach,
its political influence and its economic advantage. American bases
throughout Europe not only provide for the defense of Europe --- they
bring the U.S. a continent closer to trouble spots that threaten vital
American interests. Fighting the Islamic State group, clearly an
American interest, would have been markedly more difficult without
permanent U.S. bases in Europe and without the American-built coalition
that included every NATO nation. Without NATO, the mutual security
interests that underpin both U.S. bases and coalition operations would
be undermined. This extends to the economic realm. U.S. annual trade in
goods and services with Europe exceeds \$1 trillion, and U.S. total
direct investment in Europe nears \$3 trillion. These economic ties
enhance U.S. prosperity and provide American jobs, but they require the
degree of security now provided by NATO to endure. NATO's retirement
would thirdly exacerbate divisions within Europe. NATO's glue not only
holds European militaries together --- it provides the principal forum
to discuss and coordinate security issues. [The European Union is
unlikely to substitute for NATO in this respect because it has no
military structure, few capabilities and no superpower leadership to
bring divergent views together]{.underline}. Germany and France already
seek a plan B should NATO collapse, but without the United Kingdom in
the European Union, an all-European approach is likely to fail. [The
**[added insecurity]{.mark} of NATO's collapse [would]{.mark}** also
**[amplify]{.mark}** current **[populist movements in Europe]{.mark}.**
The **[consequence could be renationalization of European
militaries]{.mark}**, a system **that brought conflict to the 19th and
early 20th centuries**.]{.underline} The fourth consequences of life
without NATO would be global. American bilateral alliances in Asia would
each be shaken to their core should NATO fail. [America's defense
commitments there would become worthless. With China determined to claim
a dominant position in Asia, the collapse of NATO would cause America's
Asian partners to seek accommodation with China, much as the Philippines
is in the process of doing. Trump's decision to abandon the economic
Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement has already given China new
advantages in the region. **[Without]{.mark} credible [American security
commitments]{.mark}, [there would be little to stop China from]{.mark}
[controlling]{.mark} the [South China Sea]{.mark} and** probably
**[occupying Taiwan]{.mark} as well**]{.underline}. Add to this equation
the new footholds that China is building in central Asia, Africa and
Europe: Abandoning NATO would help assure China's competitive success[.
The **final impact of [NATO's retirement would be]{.mark} the** near
**[collapse of]{.mark}** what has been called the "**[l]{.mark}iberal
[i]{.mark}nternational [o]{.mark}rder."**]{.underline} This order
consists of [**treaties, alliances, agreements, institutions and modes
of behavior** mostly created by the United States in an effort **to
safeguard democracies. This [order has kept]{.mark} relative
[peace]{.mark} in the trans-Atlantic space [for seven
decades]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Trump administration has begun to
unravel elements of this order in the naive notion that they undercut
American sovereignty. The entire European project is built on the
edifice of this order. [NATO is its principal keystone. Collapsing this
edifice would undercut the multiple structures that have brought seven
decades of peace and prosperity.]{.underline} S

## **Nuclear Deterrence Good**

#### **Effective Nuclear deterrence reduces the risk for both Nuclear and Conventional conflict between Nuclear Powers.**

**Bertolin 13** Giorgio Bertolin has a post-graduate diploma in
economics from the university of Bristol and is the head of
ClimatePartnerItalia To What Extent is Nuclear Deterrence Important in
the Post-Cold War World?
https://www.e-ir.info/2013/06/04/to-what-extent-is-nuclear-deterrence-important-in-the-post-cold-war-world/

[The eventuality of a nuclear attack has always represented one of the
most dangerous threats to the safety **of a country, inasmuch the
precision and lethality of nuclear devices permit an adversary to
cripple in an extremely short period of time** **the command, control
and communication (C3) structure of the attacked state, in what is
called a "decapitation strike"** (]{.underline}Walton, 2010: 215).
**[The only effective deterrent for such an attack remains the threat of
another nuclear strike, in what is called a "second-strike
capability".]{.underline}** Anyway, today's nuclear threats are
extremely different from the ones that lead to the establishment of the
classic balance of terror during the Cold War. In a 2008 report, the US
Secretary of Defense indicates as the current most urgent causes for
concern terrorism and nuclear proliferation (US Secretary of Defense,
2008: 9). The two phenomena are closely linked, since the two most
likely scenarios of terrorist acquisition of nuclear weapons --
acquisition of HEU (highly enriched uranium) with or without the
assistance of a government and theft or transfer of a completed weapon
-- require the existence of a nuclear arsenal in a sympathising or
unreliable country (Gallucci, 2006: 53). As previously said, the main
strategy developed to deal with the threat of a nuclear attack conducted
by a non-state actor is expanded deterrence; anyhow, this measure must
be implemented by steps to prevent horizontal nuclear proliferation,
that is, the growth in the number of actors armed with nuclear weapons.
In fact, the enlargement of the nuclear club has increased the
likelihood of a nuclear strike taking place: since a single weapon is
sufficient to conduct such an attack, it can be deduced that, while
vertical proliferation (the growth in the number of warheads within a
country) does not make the eventuality of such an attack more likely,
horizontal proliferation does. Nuclear deterrence has traditionally been
associated with the neorealist view that a world with more nuclear
actors, and ideally a world composed only by nuclear actors, is the
prerequisite to a lasting peace founded on the fear of nuclear war
(Berkowitz, 1985: 115). However, this model does not consider the
current relevance of non-state actors and so-called rogue states and
their asymmetrical relationship with the traditional players. One of the
most serious challenges to nuclear deterrence in the Second Nuclear Age
is, in fact, represented by the issue of its applicability to actors
with a different behaviour than the Cold War-era US and USSR (Walton,
2010: 214). These new actors may not conform to a model of rational
behaviour, the latter being a fundamental prerequisite for deterrence to
work. Hence, the major contemporary challenge for nuclear deterrence is
to find ways to adapt itself to actors that may be non-rational: this
means forcing them to assume a rational behaviour. The reduction of the
"nuclear threshold" referred to in the US Nuclear Posture Review can be
read in the light of these facts not as an introduction of flexible
response strategies in nuclear policy, but as an action consistent with
the need for improved deterrence schemes. Being credibility far more
influential than capability as a variable that decides the effectiveness
of a nuclear deterrent (Lowther, 2009: 32), the aggressive policy of
nuclear pre-emption which is discussed in the above said document and in
the US National Military Strategy to combat Weapons of Mass Destruction
(US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2006: 18) can be seen as a
way to make the prospect of nuclear attack more real in the minds of the
potential enemies of the US. Since the nuclear taboo does not apply to
terrorist organisations or rogue states ruled by irrational leaders, the
only way to counter them is acting as if its validity was lost also for
the traditional actors (in this case, the US). The matter is different
with regard to the relationships within the circle of the established
nuclear powers. In this case, nuclear deterrence is based on the schemes
of the Cold War, as the policies of Russia and the US show. In fact, the
current expenditure for nuclear weapons, despite significant cuts, is
still extremely high, as previously mentioned. China has a considerably
inferior arsenal compared to that of the two former superpowers,
sufficient only to assure a policy of "minimal deterrence" (Lieber and
Press, 2006: 8). The concept of minimal nuclear deterrence could be the
most suitable to today's security issues regarding the relations among
declared nuclear armed states, and there are sectors of the public
opinion lobbying for an even greater reduction in the nuclear stockpiles
of the US: among the others, this position is supported by the
Federation of the American Scientists (Kristensen et al., 2009: 21).
Anyway, at the moment the official strategy of the US is oriented
differently, and the same can be said for Russia. While at the beginning
of the First Nuclear Age the US relied on nuclear weapons to
counterbalance Soviet conventional forces, today the situation has
reversed, and Russia keeps an apparently anachronistic large storage of
nuclear weapons to cope with the drastic reductions which took place
after the Cold War in its non-nuclear offensive capabilities. NATO has
stated in its Deterrence and Defence Posture Review that the current
amount of its strategic nuclear weapons is dependent on the reciprocal
level of these weapons on the Russian soil, so it is very unlikely that
there will be drastic reductions, similar to those that occurred at the
end of the Cold War, by the US and its allies in the foreseeable future.
**Nuclear Deterrence of Non-nuclear Attack** [The role of nuclear
deterrence in averting the threat of a conventional attack is currently
proving to be alive especially with regard to non-traditional nuclear
actors, that is, non-declared nuclear powers, states outside the NPT and
states that have violated the terms of the NPT.]{.underline} Countries
in this category have not been attacked militarily in recent times, and
there is some evidence that their nuclear capabilities could have played
a major role in defending them. It is the case of North Korea, a part of
Bush's "axis of evil": her policy towards the development of WMD
programs was far more aggressive than that of Iraq (on her current and
past programs: NTI, 2012), but she has not suffered any attack by the US
nor by any of their local allies. It can be argued that it was her very
progress in the development of WMDs, and especially of nuclear weapons,
that permitted her to avoid an external aggression. Given the
sensitivity of the American public opinion toward the number of
casualties during recent conflicts, it is easy to understand that a
retaliatory strike conducted by an actor facing foreign invasion is
considered as an unacceptable condition by the US. On the other side,
the threat of a nuclear attack should be questioned the survival of the
state apparatus must be considered seriously: in fact, the price to pay
to break the nuclear taboo is high, but certainly lower than that of
regime capitulation: so, these actors gain in credibility what they lack
in capability. [**Nuclear deterrence has a role also in averting
conventional attacks in a regional context. The conflict between India
and Pakistan exemplifies this point: in fact, despite the existence of
sources of tension between the two countries, t**hese actors have not
engaged in major open hostilities since their development of a nuclear
arsenal. **The fear of nuclear escalation may be the explanation for the
restraint of these governments in an area like Kashmir**, where since
the acquisition of nuclear weapons both sides have only supported a
low-intensity conflict (Joeck, 1997: 36).]{.underline} In any case,
nuclear deterrence of non-nuclear attack seems inconsistent with regard
to the traditional nuclear actors. In fact, these have continued to
experience major conventional conflicts (it is, for example, the case of
Russia with Georgia). It is possible that the threat of a nuclear
retaliation lacks credibility when only the aggressor is armed with
nuclear weapons -- as the behaviour of many nuclear powers in time of
war may lead to think -- but this would be hardly true in the case of a
WMD attack. In this respect, the biggest innovations are those developed
by the US within its strategy to combat global terrorism. The same
policy of expanded deterrence which has been discussed above is applied
also to non-nuclear threats, in particular with regard to the scenario
of a terrorist use of WMDs (Huntley, 2006: 49-50). In the National
Military Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction, Washington has
confirmed its willingness to pursue a policy aimed at "dissuading,
deterring and defeating those who seek to harm the US directly \[...\]
especially extremist enemies with weapons of mass destruction" (US
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2006: 9). Nuclear deterrence is
the most likely way to counter terrorism to be used in the future, since
pre-emptive war lacks popular support and has been recognised to be an
excessively expensive strategy. As Trager and Zagorcheva argue, nuclear
deterrence may prove to be an effective method to counter the threat
posed by non-state actors, as long as terrorists' political aims will be
influenceable by states (2005/2006: 88). **Conclusion** **[Nuclear
deterrence is still relevant in dealing with contemporary security
issues.]{.underline}** Although different strategies concerning the use
of nuclear weapons have been proposed in recent times, their application
would be extremely controversial, and for this reason is very unlikely.
[Nuclear deterrence is still an important part of the official strategy
of the US to fight traditional threats, and has been adapted to meet
also today's new security concerns. The other nuclear armed states, the
traditional as well as the non-traditional ones, have shown their
willingness to maintain the nuclear taboo, pursuing in most cases a
minimal deterrence policy.]{.underline} **[The threat of a nuclear
strike can deter both nuclear and non-nuclear attacks]{.underline}**,
the contemporary security scenario requires an evolution of deterrence
rather than a discharge of the concept as a whole. In fact, nuclear
weapons are still among the most powerful and intimidating weapons with
which states can arm themselves, and the stability of a system based on
deterrence still remains attractive, although since the end of the Cold
War maintaining this system has become far more complicated. However,
nuclear deterrence alone cannot be the answer to every security issue in
the contemporary world, and its application needs to be strengthened by
other strategies. [The main role it held during the First Nuclear Age is
lost, but its relevance, although resized, is not.]{.underline}
