[In the North African state of Libya during the early months of 2011,
the U.S. backed counter-revolutionary rebel elements sought to overthrow
the Jamahiriya government led by Col. Muammar Gaddafi. [The United
Nations Security Council at the time voted to pass two resolutions which
authorized a total arms and economic blockade against Libya as well as
the establishment of a so-called no-fly zone which is merely another
form of war declaration]{.mark}. A similar no-fly zone had been imposed
over Iraq during the 1990s [accompanied by draconian sanctions which
killed an estimated one million people]{.mark}, many of whom were
[women, children and seniors]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[After the ground operations in Libya, which began [on February
17]{.mark} were not reaping the desired results by imperialism[, a
massive blanket bombing of the oil-rich country by the Pentagon and NATO
was launched on March 19 which lasted for seven
months]{.mark}.]{.underline} [There were reports that [anywhere between
50,000 to 100,000 people were killed and two million
displaced]{.mark}]{.underline}. The longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi was
targeted and assassinated as he was attempting to exit the areas around
Sirte. [The impact of the destruction of Libya as in the cases of
Yugoslavia and Afghanistan had regional and international implications.
[Instability due to the dislocation of millions]{.mark} during and after
the air campaign [fueled further destabilization in neighboring Mali,
Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad. Libya since 2011 has become a notorious
center for human trafficking]{.mark} and internecine conflict that has
spilled over into other states prompting migration across the
Mediterranean into Southern Europe. The human traffickers engage in
dangerous methods of transportation across North Africa and the
Mediterranean Sea. Thousands die every year seeking to escape the
detention centers and continuing sectarian battles in
Libya. ]{.underline}
