### Link - Hypervisibility

#### Society characterizes all trans-people as dishonest through hypervisibility AND violence inflicted by states themselves isn't recognized. The only way progress can be made is to trans-theorize about the intricacies of visibility and invisibility.

There are those who argue that "[[**in-ness" and "outness" do not make
sense** for trans-people]{.mark}, since "trans-" is not something one is
(and therefore not something one must out oneself as)]{.underline}.
Instead, ["[trans-" is the process of becoming]{.mark} what one
is.]{.underline} Trans-theorizing [has problematized the association
between outness and visibility]{.underline}, arguing that the trans- and
genderqueer bodies demonstrate the problems with assuming a clear "self"
to be "out." If [being trans- is a process]{.underline} rather than a
result, then [it [makes little sense to be "out" as
trans]{.mark}-.]{.underline} [Yet, trans-[persons who do not immediately
self-identify]{.mark}]{.underline} as trans- (which may or may not
actually resonate with them) may be [[considered dishonest]{.mark}
when]{.underline} their "passing" is [discovered. The trans- theory
problem]{.underline} with [seeing people as "really a man" or "really a
woman"]{.underline} (and therefore "out" as a "man" or "woman")
[is]{.underline} that these discourses ["reinscribe the position that
genitalia are the essential determinants of sex"]{.underline} (Bettcher
2007:50). This [runs directly]{.underline} [[contrary to the lived
experiences]{.mark} of many trans-people]{.underline}, who [[see their
genitalia as]{.mark} either [not representative]{.mark} of [or only
partly]{.mark} representative [of their "actual"
sex]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bettcher 2007:50). Trans-theorists express
concern that [the contin- ued emphasis]{.underline} on the difference
between how trans-people look and what they "are" [is "fundamental to
transphobic representations"]{.underline} (Bettcher 2007:50).

[Trans-people are often characterized as dishonest if they are not "out"
as "trans" because they are seen as presenting as a sex they are "really
not," whereas trans-people who are not "out" are seen as lying for not
admitting the unreality of the sex they present as.]{.underline}
Trans-people's [[options]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, comprise [[being
dishon- est one way or another]{.underline}]{.mark}, "disclose 'who one
is' and come out as a pretender or masquerader, or refuse to disclose
(be a deceiver) and run the risk of forced disclosure, the effect of
which is exposure as a liar" (Bettcher 2007:50). [Visibility, then, is
pretending, while invisibility is lying.]{.underline}

This [[creates]{.mark} a politics of [hypervisibility]{.mark} of
trans-identities]{.underline}. In these terms, "visi- bility [yields a
position]{.underline} in which [what one is doing is represented as
make-believe]{.underline}, pretending, or playing dress up," while "[to
opt for invisibility]{.underline} is to remove one's life from the
domain of masquerade into actual reality\... \[which\] [generates the
effect of]{.underline} revelation, [exposure]{.underline}, or hidden
truth" (Bettcher 2007:50). Each begets violence, but the violence is
often unrecognized as such.8 Judith Butler sees it as important to think
about:

Why [[violence]{.mark} against transgender subjects is [not
recognized]{.mark} as violence]{.underline}, and why this violence is
not recognized as violence, and why this violence is [sometimes
[inflicted by the]{.mark} very [states]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that
should be offering]{.underline}]{.mark} such subjects
[[protection]{.underline}]{.mark} from violence. (Butler 2004:207)

Trans-theorists have explained this in terms of [the violent enforcement
of a settled gender]{.underline}, where [transphobic violence is
actually punishment for non- conformity]{.underline} with settled ideas
of maleness and femaleness, phrased and understood in terms of
dishonesty in order to hide that it is not honesty, but reality, [being
policed through hypervisibility]{.underline} (Lamble 2009).

[[Trans-theorizing about visibility]{.mark} could [inspire important
research]{.mark} directions [for IR]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example,
it might be [useful to ask what norms we do not see being enforced
violently, what realities are policed, and whose identities are labeled
less valid or genuine by definition]{.underline}. It might be fruitful
to theorize the ways in which public gazes silence or distort certain
voices, and to look at the ways that attention traps certain people as
public/publicized representational forces. [How does being trapped in
the public gaze affect certain people at the margins of global
politics]{.underline}? How does that relate to being trapped outside of
the public gaze? Do some people and/or groups experience both
simultaneously?

### **[Link -- State]{.underline}**

#### The state functions on heteronormative symbolism of the straight man -- using the state reaffirms those representations. 

Cynthia **Weber, 2016**, \"(PDF) Queer International Relations:
Sovereignty, Sexuality, and the Will to Knowledge, written by Cynthia
Weber," : Oxford University Press, 264 pp DOI:10.1163/2165025X-12340019
// WaVes

[[**In Queer** **I**]{.mark}nternational **[R]{.mark}**elations, Weber
demonstrates this breadth of ontologies, [epistemologies]{.mark}, and
methodologies **by [juxtaposing theoretical positions from both queer
studies and IR]{.mark}**,]{.underline} which she explains early in the
book. [She crafts two approaches that directs queer intellectual
curiosity on IR. Her first approach melds classical texts in queer
theory]{.underline} (Foucault and Butler), [feminist technoscience
studies]{.underline} (Haraway), [and post-structuralist international
relations (Ashley) into a procedure that can reveal the construction of
"homosexuality" and sexual ordering in domestic and foreign political
discourse]{.underline}. Rendering knowledge (and the beliefs, claims,
and policies that emerge from which) as discursively constructed, [Weber
posits that [**all political claims** made from the domestic to the
international scale **performs**]{.mark}]{.underline} (in the Butlerian
sense[) [**certain sexual categories that in turn figure other bodies,**
communities, and institutions in the hierarchies that order such
categories.]{.mark}]{.underline} She locates this procedure within IR by
drawing from Richard Ashley's suggestion that [**[statecraft -- the
imagination of the state and sovereignty -- is mancraft]{.mark}.**
Weber's assumptions about the queerness of IR]{.underline} thus reach
full circle[: If the crafting of sovereignty relies on the crafting of a
sovereign authority, and since **[the sovereign sign in patriarchal
power relations is the heterosexual male,]{.mark}** then the political
contestation of states must also enter sexual ordering. In other words,
states, in asserting sovereignty, [must pathologize the other into
categories dominated by masculinity, such as femininity and
queerness]{.mark}.]{.underline} This she firmly demonstrates in action
by exploring political discourses enunciated and/or performed by
masculine and queer figures around the globe. A recent case Weber
asserts is none other than Obama's administration whose discourse on
human rights, she believes, interprets the "human" as a civilized white
masculine bourgeois man -- a patriot -- to use the former president's
term

### Solves AI Ethics

#### Queer IR and queering solves a lack of AI ethics

Both examples show deliberately mischievous reclamation of the space
provided by FB to present an identity. [This [playful resistance]{.mark}
-- neither hostile, nor demure -- [is]{.mark} the kind of
[intervention]{.mark} advocated by Butler as most effective at
withstanding the tendency for norms to 'congeal into givens'. So, users
subvert tools. And [Queer Theory gives us a means of recognising and
scrutinising these dynamics]{.mark}. More powerfully for our purposes,
it also offers a means of reflection on the discipline and a tool for
design.]{.underline} I describe it as 'analogy/method' here, because its
use in this paper is quite complex. First, [[it is a tool for
analysis]{.mark}: by equating practices with queering, we learn more
about the way they operate. Second[, it is specifically a means for
engaging with meta-values.]{.mark} By meta-values, I refer to a value
system predicated on making space for divergent and evolving beliefs,
principles, standards and morals]{.underline}. Thus, there is the
intention to create resistance to an orthodoxy rather than seeking to
assign predefined characteristics to a design outcome (in as far as it
is ever possible to associate values with systems rather than the use of
them). [[Queering, as it is used here, is predicated on letting (other)
values and lifestyles su]{.mark}rface -- not the ones already in use,
but ones that might come to be if allowed enough space to emerge. In
this respect it differs from most critical practices: it is not
concerned to 'out' the values of the designer or the socio-technical
system, introduce new values, consider contextual socio-historical
factors or reflect on ethical considerations.]{.underline} Agre (1997)
suggests that a 'critical technical practice will, at least for the
foreseeable future, require a split identity -- one foot planted in the
craft work of design and the other foot planted in the reflexive work of
critique'. But queering goes one stage further to a practical
naughtiness based both on craft and reflection. It is a space-making
exercise, using the means available at the time. And while critique is
clearly one tool; hullabaloo, parody and inversion may also have their
place. Its endgame is not an analysis to inform design, but an ongoing
application of disruption as a space-making ploy and, thus, as a
hands-on method. In a truly queered context there is no final arrival
point, but an absence of dogma and a mutability that allows new truths,
perspectives and engagements to emerge through a refusal to accept
definition.4 If we use it as an analogy, [[it works to play up
intersections and resist over-definition and so allows us to explore
pluralist experience and remain off-centre, eccentric, critical,
reflexive and self-analytic.]{.mark} It creates a space for change in
the discipline of HCI. It offers the in-between-ness of Bassoli et al.
(2007) by refusing to be wholly design or evaluation, technology or
application, critique or experience. It presents an unstable zone for
disciplines to meet and morph in post-disciplinary ways. [To be queered
out of alignment in this way is not to stand in opposition to parts of
HCI or any other field, but to remain un-centred and open to new
influences -- such as Queer Theory itself -- using the dynamics of these
and other intersections.]{.mark} This stance allows a more fluid
response to changes in the field of technology, to the methodological
commitments of others and to the possible domains to be touched by
developments in computing]{.underline}. As indicated, it can have a
recursive quality. I am going to deal more thoroughly with queering as a
design method because this is the more radical contribution to practice.
Butler herself conceives of trouble as an action (1990). She points to
theatrical practices such as parody and drag as mechanisms for troubling
or throwing light on the workings of gender. I use the idea similarly,
but to explore the workings of digital technology. Troubling/queering
already takes place in the arena of technology design. There are
critical art practices which reflect on society and technology through
creating problem artefacts. They might ironicise practices: see, for
instance, the instant democracy tool, repetitionr: 'Looking for a
petition service? Try a re-petition instead. Learn how to comfortably
change the world from your armchair. Do-It-Yourself Democracy. A million
people can't be wrong. Improve your campaigns, get over one million
votes with one click!' (www.repetitionr.com), which mocks both social
activism and parliamentary procedure without referring directly to
either. There are designers whose products exist to question and raise
questions, such as Dunne and Raby's Designs for Fragile Personalities in
Anxious Times: (www.dunneandraby.co.uk/content/projects/71/0), or
Gaver's studio and work on ambiguity (e.g. Gaver et al., 2003). In the
same way as Butler points to the process of artifice, including her own
self-stylization and role as trouble-maker, these creators make
subversive entities to critique the norms of living and designing. But
the trouble can be far more intrinsic. We can introduce the troubling as
a process of design, not just of observation and use.

### Solves Biotech

#### Queering biotech solves a lack of cohesion on biotech

Tangential to this nexus of queer theory and life story, but emerging in
the same period, enter Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART). This
other kind of media is at once intensely heteronormative, and radically
queer. ARTs both destabilise heterosexual reproduction and re-enforce it
through access to fertility, gestation and biological genealogy.
Surrogacy, gamete and sperm donation and IVF have become dominant modes
in ART and have been made accessible to different populations, in very
uneven but also potentially transformative ways (Farquar, 1997; Mamo,
2007). At the same time that trajectories in queer culture and other
accounts destabilised biological kinship as the primary site of family,
and affirmed and legitimated families of choice and made kinship, ARTs
also made an industry of restoring biology as the material of kinship
(Smietana et al., 2018). Although stories of biology as kinship are
powerful and often represented as universal, they are also partial and
linked to particular centres. Stories of inheritance and descent are
bound up in European narratives of evolution, class and the circulation
and inheritance of wealth. In the UK context, for example, working-class
histories, histories of colonisation and slavery (McClintock 1995) and
contemporary kinship stories from Black and Asian diasporas (Puar, 2007;
Gunaratnam, 2014) challenge heteronormative assumptions that put biology
at the centre (Lewis, 2019, 2020). In the context of scholarship in the
USA, Black and indigenous feminism (Gumbs et al., 2016; Tallbear, 2018)
and family abolitionism (O'Brien, 2019) also challenge heteronormative
genetic kinship narratives. [The scope of this special section remains
fairly narrow in its White European/American focus. In this sense, it
fails to inclusively open up the field and reproduces this lens.
[Scholarship that examines Black feminisms and queer intersectional
feminisms of colour across this terrain includes that of]{.mark} Kim
[Tallbear]{.mark}, Allondra [Nelson]{.mark}, Alexis Pauline
[Gumbs]{.mark}, Gail [Lewis]{.mark}, Julia [Oparah]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
Alicia [Bonaparte]{.mark}. Tallbear\'s (2013) work on Native American
belonging and genetic testing is generative in opening up critique of
genetic science.]{.underline} The interplay of race and genetic testing
is further examined by Nelson (2016) in their work on race and the
genome. Examining political kinship and relation, Gail Lewis develops an
object theory of Black feminism as 'a project of ethical relation'
(2020: 8). Connecting across this issue\'s themes of mothering, Oparah
and Bonoparte (2016) have curated a powerful collection, centring Black
women, addressing maternal health care and developing a birth justice
approach. Whilst attention has been paid to families, kinship of choice
and new family-making, less work gives attention to the ways in which
biotechnology has queered kinship relations and stabilises, disrupts or
creates relationality. Notable exceptions include Queering Reproduction
(Mamo, 2007), Mediated Intimacies (Andreassen et al., 2007), Making
Parents (Thompson, 2007) and Bits of Life: Feminism at the Intersections
of Media, Bioscience, and Technology (Smelik and Lykke, 2015). This
special section attempts to redraw this focus to bring these areas
together, sometimes in the same article, and to create a space of
intellectual kinship for these different orientations to attend to each
other. Through this section, we have aimed to craft an intervention that
brings together biological and digital media forms; one that recognises,
traces and amplifies the interconnection of medium specificity and
biomediation. Borrowing from Dahl and Gabb (2020), we have aimed to
craft this in a way that attempts to be mindful of context and is
attuned to their analysis: "to not ignore the foundational questions of
gender, sexuality, race, and nation that inform kinship. To \[...\]
think further about what queer intellectual kinship means, who we care
for and who we consider ourselves related to \[...\] and to how our
geopolitical, sexual, gendered and generational differences and ties
shape and make our affinities and solidarities" (Dahl and Gabb, 2020).
Special section articles The section brings together articles which
queer genealogical research and/or examine queer genealogies. [[Queering
in this context can refer to any engagement with queer theory, and or
engagement with LGBTQ+ genealogies]{.mark} and their intersections. We
speculated that [genealogy in this context might refer to ancestry,
kinship, relation, reproduction, history, origin and
naturalisation]{.mark}. The special section seeks to queer the existing
field through both an attention to queering genealogical analysis and
examining queer kinship across life story, media and
biotechnology.]{.underline}

In, 'From the Families We Choose to the Families We Find Online', Rikke
Andreassen centres her analysis on connections made between donor
siblings, facilitated through the sociality of digital media. This
article draws on both the medium of semen, and social media to examine
the way in which kinship is re-made through 'finding' donor sperm
relations. In the context of a boom in queer and single families, made
possible through access to sperm banks, Andreassen examines how new
networks of donor siblings have emerged. These connect a relatively
small number of donors to an extended network of potentially hundreds of
recipients of donor treatments. This extends to a significant network of
donor siblings and a generative context for new routes to kinship for
the children of single and queer parents. Andreassen notes that single
parents are more likely than queer parents to engage in extended donor
sibling networks and argues that this offers another way of thinking
about queering kinship. The article brings together donor treatments and
social media to examine the convergence of these technologies as
reproductive. In 'Queering the Origin Story: Adults Raised by LBTQ
Parents Narrate Kinship and Connection', Eliza Garwood explores the
experiences of adults raised by LBTQ parents. The origin stories that
emerge combine genetic origin and queer kinship in the construction of
narrative identity. These stories function as a resource to build
connection and create family bonds, as well as to a broader sense of
queer identity and politics. Garwood argues that although biogenetic
ties remain central to understanding kinship, these origin stories are
as social as they are biogenetic. Garwood looks at the way that 'many
adults raised in LBTQ households were interested in tracing their queer
family histories, rather than solely their biological relations'. These
queer family histories invoked a much broader sense of family history
and identity than the immediate family. They drew on queer histories;
coming out; community and activism; and media-making practices including
film, documentary and memoir. These stories bring together genetic and
social stories, and connect political, social and personal histories.
Elizabeth Reed and Tanya Kant bring together digital and biological
media in their article 'One Donor Egg and "a Dollop of Love": ART and
de-queering Genealogies in Facebook Advertising'. They examine the
targeted advertising of egg banking and egg donation through social
media. Drawing on Kant\'s work on algorithmic targeting and Reed\'s work
on the role of media in identity-making, they explore the construction
of essentialised heterosexual femininity in the promotional culture of
commercial ARTs. Their analysis demonstrates the ways in which egg
donation is conjured as a relation between women, of gifts and
reproductive hope. This imaginary is constructed in the service of the
imperatives of biomedicalisation (Clarke, 2014) in an industry facing an
undersupply of eggs. Sophie Lewis gives an account of mothers and
mothering, in 'Diary of a Family-Abolitionist\'s Year on Tour', threaded
together with an incredible reach of connective queer intellectual
kinship-making and skill. Lewis combines political, social and personal
histories through stories about her own mother, family abolitionism,
xenofeminism and Black feminism, the latter particularly through the
work of Alexis Pauline Gumbs (Gumbs, 2010; Gumbs et al., 2016). Lewis\'s
manifesto Full Surrogacy Now also underpins this account, and the death
of Lewis\'s mother in the period of writing the article frames the
narrative. [[Lewis\'s account is of dystopia, reparation and kinship --
or kith connection -- figuring comrades, momrades, doulas and alien
connection: 'Kinship is always made, not given]{.mark}. By the same
token, more often than we think, where kinship is assumed as a given, it
fails to be made'. This premise, that kinship is always made, whether
through biological relation, blood ties, adoption, political affinity or
stranger-relations, furthers the conceptual reach of queering
genealogy.]{.underline} Conclusion: genealogy and reparation Calls to
radical relationality, and the recognition of new kinship patterns are
emerging in the context of digital life, ecological crisis and
intensifying social injustice. Techno-social structures have both
transformed kinship relations and exacerbated their most reactionary
formations, at the level of species, nation, kin and person. In this
context, a critical re-examination of what it means to be related to
life, to kin and to the world is central to understanding individual and
collective identity. Bringing together this section in the context of
the pandemic has necessarily pushed us all into very different
timelines, even given the infamous length of time anticipated in
academic publishing. This feels like a project spread over decades -- in
many ways it has been -- and this introduction aims to give a sense of
that longer timeline to enable a platform that in turn contextualises
the excellent writing and thinking in the articles published here.
Media-making, including the promotional cultures of biotechnology, the
novels that structure Love and Cvetkovich\'s analysis and the media
genres central to Reed\'s research, is a productive kinship practice
(Pidduck, 2009, 2018). In tune with this thinking about media-making as
kinship, and the importance of novels as connective objects, we alight
on one further novel here as both appropriation and coda: Girl, Woman,
Other (Evaristo, 2020). We started this project by looking for stories
about intergenerational relation; stories are a technology of kinship,
and ART and other [[biotechnologies are technologies of story: biomedia
across text and test tube]{.mark}. These stories of the different voices
across this novel speak to the challenge of reparative world-making [in
dystopian times, of generation and the making of hopeful genealogies of
kith-ship, time, queerness and technology]{.mark}.]{.underline} Evaristo
generously offers these stories to her readers, and Girl, Woman, Other
came into print as the final comments were coming in for the peer review
of these articles. Reading these together enabled an added passage
through Evaristo\'s novel, which is about intergenerational kinship,
telling the stories of twelve characters. It is (mostly) about Black
women in the UK. It gives voice to feminism, families and friendship and
draws together the past in the present, connecting and disconnecting
mothers, sisters, lovers and children. [[It connects 1980s activism in
the UK with women\'s land projects in the USA, and navigates gender
identity, biology, queerness, feminism, class, nationality, ethnicity
and racism.]{.mark} Towards the end of the novel, it also draws on
genetic testing as a technology of life story, as a narrative device and
as an agent in the story, making genealogy intelligible and opening up
futures of kinship-making. For us, reading Evaristo together through the
production of this special issue, writing this introduction and bringing
together these excellent articles across the theme of queering genealogy
has been part of a project of queer intellectual and political
kinship.]{.underline}

### Alt -- Disaporic Perspectives

#### The alt is an embracement of diasporic perspectives that portray the violent histories of imperialism that solve the root cause of forever wars

Insurgent Aesthetics is about the creativity and fugitive beauty that
emanate from the shadows of terrible violence incited by forever war.
[[Of freedom dreams flecked by inscriptions of wartime's death and
dispossession]{.mark}.25 [The forever war is an assault on the human
sensorium for citizens]{.mark}, subjects, survivors, and refugees of US
empire alike.26 A time of ever more state security and imperial
violence, the historical present necessitates more sensuous ways of
knowing and feeling that challenge the militarized imperatives of the
state and exceed the visual register alone. [The global circulation of
images of violence and social suffering has also intensified in our
public culture over the past three decades.]{.mark} As a privileged
regime of power, the field of vision is central to the manufacture and
global supremacy of US war-making regimes and to the violent regulation
of racialized, gendered, and sexualized bodies under the conditions of
state security and surveillance]{.underline}.27 Given the US state's
will toward quantified abstraction in counting, without ever being
accountable to, those killed, diseased, displaced, traumatized, and/or
maimed in its armed conflicts, how might we divine other, more sensuous
and affective ways of knowing this forever war and its inhuman
violences? This book asserts that we must demand a stranger
calculus---what I term a queer calculus---that unsettles prevailing
interpretations of the forever war, makes sensuous what has been ghosted
by US technologies of abstraction, and endows the designs for seemingly
impossible futures amid infinite aggression. [[A queer calculus of the
forever war advances an account of both dominant knowledge]{.mark}
apparatuses and data logics of the US security state as well as
alternative logics, affects, emotions, and affiliations of diasporic
subjects living and laboring in the heart of empire]{.underline}. One
such embodied queer calculus can be found in the corpus of aesthetic
forms created by contemporary diasporic artists from South Asia and the
Greater Middle East. These imaginative works of art reassemble vision
with the disqualified knowledges, histories, geographies, and memories
preserved by the "lower" senses of empire's gendered, racialized Others
to fashion an insurgency against empire's built sensorium[. [In so
doing, these insurgent aesthetics craft a queer calculus of US empire
that makes intimate what is rendered distant,]{.mark} renders tactile
what is made invisible, and unifies what is divided, thereby conjuring
forms of embodied critique that can envision a collective world [within
and beyond the spaces of US empire's perverse logics of global
carcerality, security, and war]{.mark}. This book engages a wide range
of critical interdisciplinary paradigms to reveal the radical
experiments, aesthetic strategies, and freedom dreams of contemporary
Arab, Muslim, and South Asian diasporic artists. I]{.underline} argue
that these works comprise a transnational constellation of visual art
and aesthetics that together have animated new ways to think, feel,
sense, and map the world amid US global state violence and its forever
wars across the so-called Muslim world.28 Specifically, the book surveys
the broader post--Cold War expansion of US militarism in the Greater
Middle East (Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Palestine) and the domestic
regimes of surveillance and repression in the US and other militarized
sites mapped onto a transnational jihadist network[. [It contends that
new and flexible forms of remote killing, torture, confinement,
surveillance, and lawfare have built a distinctive post--9/11
infrastructure of gendered, racialized state violence]{.mark} both
within and beyond US borders, which in turn marks the ongoing present as
a distinct age within the longue durée of US settler colonial
society.]{.underline} I explore this complex terrain through a
contrapuntal queer feminist analysis of contemporary Arab, Muslim, and
South Asian diasporic visual cultures and their critical intersections
with the contemporary logics and tactics of global warfare.29 Although
many scholars have studied the impact of liberal empires and late modern
warfare in the Greater Middle East, including the militarized and
racialized vision of US imperialism at its core, insufficient attention
has been paid to how the state's dominant necropolitical calculus of
neoliberal security and warfare has been thwarted and reimagined.30 By
contrast, this book foregrounds the conceptual works of contemporary
artists from South Asian and Middle Eastern diasporas, whose insurgent
aesthetic acts refashion ascendant ways of knowing and feeling the
forever war. My chief premise in this book is that if we want to
apprehend (so as to ultimately arrest) contemporary transnational
security politics and carceral practices, especially the prevailing
biopolitical regimes of surveillance, imprisonment, and killing
perfected at the domestic and international fronts of the forever war,
then we need an alternate approach to the maps of strategic thinkers and
security analysts who have been telling us how we should look, think,
and feel about the world and its violences. [[By privileging a wide
range of diasporic cultural forms]{.mark}---namely, visual and sound
installation, performance, painting, photography, new media, and
video---[as a generative site for critiquing American war and
empire]{.mark}, this book illuminates what I term insurgent [aesthetics,
an alternative articulation of minoritarian knowledge produced by those
populations and their diasporic kin most devastated by the effects of
the homeland security state and its forever wars]{.mark}.]{.underline}31
This book illustrates how Arab, Muslim, and South Asian diasporic
artists in the US and Europe, including Mahwish Chishty, Wafaa Bilal,
Naeem Mohaiemen/ Visible Collective, Rajkamal Kahlon, Index of the
Disappeared, Mariam Ghani, and Larissa Sansour, have grappled in their
work with the neoliberal state of exception and the national security
state's use of gendered racial violence. Insurgent Aesthetics documents
the impact of present-day militarized security practices and historical
legacies of imperial violence on diasporic, (im)migrant, and refugee
communities in the US who have been besieged both by domestic wars on
terror, crime, drugs, and immigration as well as military and foreign
policies directed at their homelands. These artists, in turn, have
produced sensuous affiliations and political imaginaries that critique
the simultaneous proliferation of gendered racism, neoliberal
capitalism, heteropatriarchy, and Islamophobia in the post--9/11 period.
[[These concepts represent intersectional systems of power and violence
that fuel the ideological engines that legitimate the homeland security
state's use of global prisons, confinement technologies, overt killing,
and permanent warfare]{.mark} as inevitable features of a political
economy that seeks to "solve" our multifarious contemporary
crises]{.underline}. In this context, what role can expressive culture
and aesthetics play in struggles over hegemony of the contemporary
neoliberal carceral, security, and warfare state? This book answers this
question by centering the expansive world-making knowledge practices of
diasporic visual and multimedia artists who hail from societies besieged
by war but live and labor in the heart of empire. In short, the book
investigates how [South Asian and Middle Eastern diasporic artists
challenge violent histories of US militarism, sustain critical
opposition to the global war machine through the realms of art and
culture, and create alternative systems of knowing, feeling, and living
with and beyond forever warfare.]{.underline}

I return to the ongoing aesthetic and political collaboration of the
Index of the Disappeared at the end of this book in order to revisit
conceptual trajectories traced throughout and to signal insurgent
aesthetic possibilities that expand those included in this study.
Throughout Insurgent Aesthetics[, I have mined [this rich field of
expressive culture and artistic responses to twenty-first-century global
warfare in a search for forms of aesthetic possibility]{.mark} that open
up alternative modes of knowing, sensing, living, escaping, and feeling
in the forever war. If the forever war is an assault on the human
sensorium for citizens, subjects, survivors, and refugees of US empire,
I have chosen to [center a queer feminist analysis of the performative
body of the racialized and dispossessed to reveal a complex insurgency
against empire's built sensorium]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The imaginative
works of art that I call "insurgent aesthetics"]{.underline}]{.mark}
[reassemble vision with the disqualified knowledges, histories,
geographies, and memories preserved by the "lower" senses of empire's
gendered racialized Others.]{.underline} In so doing, I show how the
minoritarian body serves as a critical site for the acquisition of
unorthodox and often unexpected political knowledge about security,
terrorism, and warfare. A major goal of this book is not only to offer a
diagnosis of how neoliberal security and warfare have constrained
dominant lifeworlds and accelerated human suffering via the atrocities
of war, but also to elucidate how these artists provide the designs for
sensing other, more disobedient and arresting ways of being in the
world. By foregrounding the phenomenological and sensuous dimensions of
war-making in aesthetic practices of contemporary artists from the South
Asian and Middle Eastern diasporas, I documented how ascendant archives
of the US forever war have worked to bury, obscure, abstract,
misrecognize, and misremember alternative accounts of the forever war
and its gendered racial-colonial targets in the Greater Middle East. In
my close readings of diasporic art and performance, I offered [[a queer
calculus as a critical framework to account for the US state's
differential valuation of human life. I]{.mark}f "calculus" implies a
cold accounting of wartime facts and figures, these cultural works upend
such an accounting, [queering the process of archival production so as
to constitute a different and more sensuous mode of reckoning with the
ultimately unaccountable devastations of war. A queer calculus of the
forever war advances an account of both dominant knowledge]{.mark}
apparatuses and data logics of the US security state and alternative
logics, affects, emotions, [and affiliations of diasporic subjects
living and creating in the heart of empire. In so doing, a queer
calculus makes intimate what is rendered distant, renders tactile what
is made invisible]{.mark}, and makes unified what is divided, thereby
conjuring up forms of embodied critique that can envision a collective
world within and beyond the spaces of US empire's perverse logics of
global carcerality, security, and warfare.]{.underline}

#### The alt allows us to solve for the root cause of forever wars

[This book has centered the expansive world-making knowledge practices
of Arab, Muslim, and South Asian diasporic multimedia artists and
activists who hail from societies beset by war but who live and labor in
the heart of empire [in order to rethink the strategies, technologies,
geographies, and strategic ambitions of contemporary US neoliberal
security and warfare]{.mark}.]{.underline} It has pursued a queer
feminist fugitive critique of the US military's desire for "full
spectrum dominance," with a slantwise relation to the multiple disparate
scales and sites of the body, land, air, spectrum, and sky, as well as
affective and sensuous experiences that exceed the visual frame. My hope
is that this close engagement with the insurgent creative practices of
these conceptual artists will allow us to ["[disrupt neat narratives of
freedom and escape" and compel us to think, feel, and imagine
otherwise]{.mark} about the manifold violences of the social world.24 It
may also help us reckon with and reimagine anew our own intimate
affective relation and collusion with the militarized surveillance and
securitization projects of US empire. I]{.underline}f we follow the
visionary lead of Okoumou, Sansour, Ghani, Ganesh, and the many other
creative practitioners convened in these pages, [[we might be able to
peer down at the ground queerly and with fresh perspective.]{.mark} We
might begin to train our gaze on and stimulate our other senses with the
felicitous cracks and folds and lines of flight in what the forever war
has waged and to begin once again the work of exploiting and [amplifying
forms of fugitivity, refusal, and rebellion that take us as far and as
high as we all can go.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Alt - Celebration

#### The alt is to celebrate queerness, a stance that disrupts hierarchies of heteronormativity in a way that identity politics can't.

[[Queer i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations [has demonstrated how
sex(uality) connects to international politics]{.mark},
[identifying]{.mark}, for instance, the [sexualized logics through
which]{.mark} international [security]{.mark} works and how security
discourses often rest upon gendered--sexualized--racialized
constructions about what/who needs protection and what/who is a
threat]{.underline} (Cooper-Cunningham, 2020; Leigh and Weber, 2019;
Richter-Montpetit, 2014, 2018). [Here, I ([re)turn to queer theory
through the politics of sexual shame]{.mark} and stigma [to move
beyond]{.mark} the identification of [heteronormative power
structures]{.mark} underpinning international politics. I [bring
into]{.mark} [i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations [a queer politics
that is explicitly anti-normative]{.mark}, delights in sexual
difference, revels in abjectness and embraces the disruptive force of
queerness that flouts rigid and punitive norms around sex, gender and
sexual desire]{.underline}. Queer theory acknowledges the deep
connection between gender and sexuality. They intertwine in the sense
that desire for the opposite sexed/gendered body is assumed natural and
'normal', whereas desire for the same breaks with normative sexuality
and gender. [[We can]{.mark} therefore [speak of a gendered
heterosexual/homosexual dichotomy that is powerful, ordering and
hierarchical]{.mark}. Heteronormativity -- the structures of
understanding that privilege heterosexuality -- ensures that 'if you
deviate at any point from this program, you do so at your own
cost']{.underline} (Warner, 2000: 38). All dichotomies privilege one
side of a divide and thereby produce a hierarchical relationship between
juxtaposed terms. [Opposite-/same-sex [sexual desires and behaviours
have been constituted in hierarchical opposition as
normal/perverse]{.mark}, natural/deviant. Consequently, those
[practising sexual behaviours that deviate from the heteronormative
programme 'are subjected to a presumption of]{.mark} mental illness,
disreputability, [criminality]{.mark}, restricted social and physical
mobility, [loss of institutional support]{.mark}, and economic
sanctions]{.underline}' (Rubin, \[1984\] 2011: 149). [[This has led to
the persecution and securitization of supposedly deviant
sexuality]{.mark} and gender performances. Queer theorists have shown
that stigma, shame and moralism about appropriate sexual behaviour and
erotic desire are essential in upholding this powerful dichotomy of
sexual and gender difference]{.underline}. Michael Warner's work on the
politics of sexual shame is instructive: stigma is 'a mark on the body'
that constitutes 'the person, not the deed, as tainted', whereas shame
is linked more to the act (Warner, 2000: 27--28). [[To deviate from
normative sexualit]{.mark}y -- which names appropriately gendered
objects of desire and types of sex -- [is to engage in shameful
acts.]{.mark} When these desires/acts are constituted as identities, as
the essence of one's being, [they invite stigmatization]{.mark}.
Destroying deeply entrenched and resilient systems of oppression such as
patriarchal gender and heteronormativity is not as simple as pointing to
their discursive, socially (re)produced, contingent nature.
[Destabilizing powerful discourses and showing their reliance on
obedience]{.mark}, repetition and fear of transgression [is only one
step]{.mark}.]{.underline} On this, Cathy Cohen (1997) makes an
important point: [pow[er and hierarchies can be rearranged and
transformed but never fully eliminated. A queer politics that invites
radical transformation of society and politics is itself eternally
oppositional]{.mark}, anti-assimilationist, deliberately antisocial,
attendant to every relation to power, [and adopts an ethics that 'cuts
against every form of hierarchy]{.mark}']{.underline} (Warner, 2000:
36).9 [[Queer is]{.mark} therefore [distinct from an identity-based LGBT
civil rights agenda. It is a more radical and transformative
politics]{.mark} that short-circuits the 'hierarchies that allow systems
of oppression to persist and operate efficiently' by not only
challenging how people understand sexuality but also creating
oppositional space against all forms of domination and
marginalization]{.underline} (Cohen, 1997: 437, 440). [[Queer is
intersectional, coalitional, and rejects LGBT identity politics that
turns sexual and gender 'deviance' (acts) into identities and
assimilates]{.mark} lesbians, gays, bisexuals and trans people [into
heteronormative institutions]{.mark} that perpetuate cisheterosexuality
as the norm. [Identity-based politics fails to interrogate the politics
of sexual shame]{.mark} and stigma [that operates to quash
deviance;]{.mark} how it is used to punish individuals for failing to
conform to cisheteronormative demands, often in the name of the nation's
health]{.underline} (Rubin, \[1984\] 2011; Warner, 2000). [[A liberatory
queer politics refuses to sanitize or morally legitimize sexual
difference and instead takes delight in shame]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Bersani, 1996; Warner, 2000). This is not the same as perpetuating
discourses of queerness as 'abnormal' in insidiously phobic ways since
queer does not work through a heteronormative epistemology (Sedgwick,
2008; Warner, 1993). In its refusal of normativity, queer is
anti-assimilationist, oppositional, non-proscriptive, and, in rejecting
society, takes 'fierce pride in bucking political, emotional, and sexual
norms' (Gould, 2009: 264). [[Queer is]{.mark} therefore [attentive to
all those who endure the penalties of divergence from cisheteronormative
culture.]{.mark} Its radical politics lies in its revelry in stigmatic
and abject associations; its delight in flouting rigid and punitive
norms around sex, gender and sexuality in ways that are constituted as
perverse, immoral, unthinkable or fundamental threats to children,
society, the common good and national security]{.underline} (see
Bersani, 1996; Edelman, 2004; Gould, 2009). [If [being abject]{.mark} --
generally a negative thing -- [is to stand outside of]{.mark} and/or
fail to conform with [dominant identities,]{.mark} systems and orders --
in this case, normative sexuality and gender -- then [queerness,]{.mark}
which works through a different epistemology, [delights in abjection by
deliberately flouting heteronormative demands]{.mark}]{.underline}. To
be abject is favourable. [Queer is therefore a political commitment to
never being nor wanting to be constituted 'normal' for all the power
that entails. [It is an outlaw existence]{.mark} that is antisocial in
its perpetual, unapologetic anti-normativity. [Identifying and
destabilizing oppressive regimes of ab/normalization that constitute
particular bodies and their behaviours as normal/perverse is
importan]{.mark}t]{.underline} (Butler, 1990; Warner, 2000). However,
Bersani demanded more of queer theory and politics: we may discover,
within the very ambiguities of being gay, a path of resistance far more
threatening to dominant social orders than vestimentary blurrings of
sexual difference and possibly subversive separations of sex from
gender. There are some glorious precedents for thinking of homosexuality
as truly disruptive -- as a force not limited to the modest goals of
tolerance for diverse lifestyles, but in fact mandating the politically
unacceptable and politically indispensable choice of an outlaw
existence. (Bersani, 1996: 76, emphasis in original) He suggested that
'the value of sexuality is to demean the seriousness of efforts to
redeem it', for 'if the rectum is the grave in which the masculine ideal
(an ideal shared -- differently -- by men and women) of proud
subjectivity is buried, then it should be celebrated for its very
potential for death' (Bersani, 1987: 222, emphasis in original; see also
Bersani, 1996: 19). Problematizing how anal sex has been constituted as
the aberration that 'feminizes' the 'passive' man -- where the rectum is
the sanctum where masculinity resides -- Bersani proposes [[embracing
queer abjection and using it as a force for shattering
masculine/feminine ideals and attendant power structures]{.mark} that
constrain erotic pleasure and subjectivity to rigidly gendered
sexuality; short-circuiting heteronormative sociality by taking pride in
deviant sex(uality); [and liberation from repression]{.mark}. [Queer is
more than resistance to heteronormativity]{.mark} by showing how it
works. It is more than mimicry, parody, troubling or a camp reworking of
hegemonic forms of the social -- the compulsory practice of
heterosexuality -- [and is instead 'a potentially revolutionary
inaptitude . . . for sociality]{.mark} as it is known']{.underline}
(Bersani, 1996: 75). It unapologetically embraces deviation and uses it
as a vehicle for social transformation. This antisocial version of queer
is tied to the politics of gay shame, stigma and respectability.
[Recognizing gay shame in deviance from the heteronormative programme,
queer people/theorists/activists argued for pride in sexual difference.
This is rooted in recognition that even the most morally defended sex is
perverted: we are all subject to the spectre of desire and its
uncontrollable, unpredictable workings]{.underline} (Bersani, 1987: 222;
Warner, 2000: 2--3, 36--38). This queer pride differs from that
associated with the 'politics of respectability' that emerged in the
1980s and remains central to the LGBT political project (Gould, 2009:
245). Instead of downplaying sexual difference for a shot at inclusion
in 'an oppressive and exploitative society' (cue sanitized slogans like
'love is love') -- [[a strategy that]{.mark} ironically [achieves the
phobic goal of eliminating difference]{.mark} -- pride in [sexual
deviance 'weaponizes' the constitution of queer sex as abject
for]{.mark} 'righteous [rebellion']{.mark} against sociopolitical
norms]{.underline} (Gould, 2009: 249[)[. It resists the trap of effusing
moral justifications for sexual tastes]{.mark} and practices -- as if
erotic pleasure has to be defended.]{.underline} To playfully delight in
abjection is to take joy in being abject and to tease those who take sex
too seriously by attempting to moralize it or control desire. [[To
celebrate queerness by taking endless]{.mark}, playful, ridiculing
[delight in it, rather than hiding what might hamper social acceptance,
is political]{.mark}. In the case of Russian political homophobia, sex
is geopolitical. [Celebrating queerness is recognition that bodies are
the battleground upon which geopolitical struggles are
fought]{.mark}]{.underline} (Russia vs. Gayropa) [[through control of
gender performance, sexual freedoms and bodily
pleasures]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Rather than resignifying transgressive
sexual desire or gender performance as 'normal' and allowing it to be
subsumed -- accommodated, disarmed -- into dominant society, [queer
shortcircuits the power of heteronormativity by]{.mark} embracing its
abject label, [refusing to]{.mark} (be made to) [conform to
cisheteronormative standards of social and political life]{.mark}, and
finding joy from the trauma of the normal imposed. This refusal does not
dissolve the hierarchical straight/queer, normal/abnormal binary as such
but short-circuits its power. [Acknowledging the hierarchical
constitution of sexual practices/desires]{.mark} and certain erotic
pleasures as perverse, [queer challenges heteronormativity]{.mark} and
homophobic hierarchies [by rejoicing in queer aberrance]{.mark},
delighting in it and claiming dignity in supposedly shameful erotic
pleasures -- ultimately [laying the groundwork for new forms of (queer)
subjectivity that challenge what is deemed
shameful.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Alt -- Embody Queerness

#### The alternative is to embody queerness -- only that solves traditionally gendered approaches to IR and deconstructs the binaries of masculinity and femineity

Cynthia **Weber, 2016**, \"(PDF) Queer International Relations:

"[[The end of man]{.mark}," as Foucault boldly announced in 1971, [will
be the end not only of the dominance of men over other sexes but also of
the foundations of Western knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}:
individuality, consciousness, the ego. Looking at the international
queer liberation movements since the 1960s, the primacy of masculinity
surely has been challenged, confirming the observation [that the figure
of man historically cemented by Western civilization and expansion is
"in the process of disappearing."]{.underline} Cynthia Weber's most
recent contribution to inter-national relations (IR) scholarship, Queer
International Relations: Sovereignty, Sexuality, and the Will to
Knowledge, both believes in and inadvertently belies this prophecy.
Weber's book primarily argues that sovereignty and its sexualization
play a key role in domestic and international games of power (p. 5).
[[Statecraft]{.underline}]{.mark}, she surmises, [[equates to
**mancraft**]{.mark}, or [the "**art of fixing a paradigmatic
interpreta-tion of sovereign man**]{.mark} **that the state can mirror
and serve**]{.underline}" (Ashley 1989, 203). In tracing the rich
scholarship of IR and global queer specialists from around the world,
Weber has not only produced a sweeping investigation of sexualization
strategies in foreign policymaking and interstate relations. By
intuiting a novel way of understanding the queer in global politics, she
also exposes how new logics of statecraft have appropriated the
erstwhile radical movement of the lgbtq+ community, revealing that the
end of ~~man~~ \[humans\] is off the beaten path. Nevertheless, [the
quintessentially queer episteme Weber proposes, embodied in the logic of
either/or, may shed much light on what other paths must be taken towards
queer liberation and, as Foucault once dreamt, the end of
~~man~~\[humankind\].]{.underline} Weber's unsettling -- that is queer
-- propositions are made even more radical by the very existence of the
book. Fascinated less in interstate relations and more on microlevel
experiences of power, **[gendered approaches to inter-national politics
is still met by pockets of resistance in the field of IR.]{.underline}**
[[Queer]{.underline}]{.mark}, as understood by pioneering queer theorist
Eve Sedgwick, [[is "the open mesh of possibilities]{.mark}, gaps,
overlaps, dissonances and resonances, lapses and excesses of meaning
when the [constituent elements of anyone's gender]{.mark}, of anyone's
sexuality aren't made (or can't be made) to signify
monolithically]{.underline}" (1993, 8). [[Queerness
embodies]{.underline}]{.mark} an invasion, an unsettling of fictional
categories, such as [[binarized sexes and genders, that have been frozen
in history through exercises of hegemonic state and institutional power.
IR]{.mark} scholarship [is generally articulated through a masculinized
parlance]{.mark}; it speaks of states, wars, weaponry, and [world
leaders]{.mark} who [are commonly]{.mark} bourgeois, [white,
heterosexual male]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark}. **[[Queer
IR]{.underline}]{.mark}** resists this occupation by introducing a
"sexuality variable" into the equation, offering refreshed ways of
mapping phenomena "as diverse as colonial-ism, human rights, and the
formation of states and international communities that provide vastly
different renderings of international politics" (Weber 2016, 23). Themes
that would interest Filipino IR specialists such as gendered sovereignty
discourse, sex(ualized) tourism, and lgbtq+-allied
**[[policymaking]{.underline}]{.mark}**, to name a few, **[[may be
enriched through this novel lens]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### **[Alt -- Queer Monstronsities]{.underline}**

#### The alt is to embrace the monstrosity within queer identities as a means to disrupt the societal idealism against us---only through rejection of empowerment and the embracement of revolutionary identity politics can we integrate the societal other

Julie **Reshe**, Phd, 10-16-20**18**, Medium, Revolutionary Monsters:
the death ~~[Suicide]{.underline}~~ of Identity Politics,
https://juliereshe.medium.com/identities-can-be-emancipated-and-empowered-but-only-queer-monsters-can-liberate-18667779b7c3,
/Wooster-RFS

In their discourse on the revolution, [Negri and Hardt use the concept
of a positive generative monster. [Monstrosity]{.mark} [arises as
otherness,]{.mark} something contrary [to the existing order]{.mark}. It
is a freak child who differs from her mother. [Monstrosity implies
imbalance and terrifying excess]{.mark}. The [framework of]{.mark}
existing [rationality is too narrow to accommodate the excess of its
creative forces]{.mark}. It is this [terrifying monstrous excess]{.mark}
that [points to]{.mark}wards [a]{.mark}n
[alt]{.mark}ernative.]{.underline}

The example of a struggle against monsters, that [Negri and Hardt
suggest, are witch hunts in Europe and America in the 16th and 17th
centuries. "Witches" is a way of naming those who transgress the
framework of the dominant religious dogmas at that time.]{.underline} As
an example of the modern forms of monstrosity, [[Negri and Hardt point
to]{.mark} the image of [a woman whose behavior does not coincide with
the role traditionally attributed to her]{.mark}. These are, for
instance, women who are not willing to do affective labor on call
("smile appropriately, tend to hurt feelings, knit social relationships,
and generally perform care and nurturing"), for this reason they are
perceived [as a kind of monster]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Although Negri and Hardt emphasize the positivity and generativeness of
monsters, one can argue with them, noting that [[monsters]{.mark} are in
no way positive or generative from the point of view of the existing
rationality framework --- they [are exclusively destructive and
dangerous]{.mark} (this is what the word "monster" means) . [Once they
gain]{.mark} a characteristic of [generativeness and positivity, they
can no longer be]{.mark} considered [monsters]{.mark}.]{.underline}

According to Negri and Hardt, ["Revolution is monstrous". They introduce
a terminological distinction between emancipation and liberation. The
revolution pursues the goal of liberation, while identity politics ---
the goal of emancipation. The latter, if focused on itself, contradicts
a truly revolutionary goals. Identity politics suggests that there is
something universally shared by all members of a particular oppressed
group: a shared nature or essence (for example, feminism is based on the
imputed unity of female gender).]{.underline}

[[Identity politics leads the struggle towards emancipation]{.mark} of a
certain group united based on the shared identity, but at the same time
it imposes this identity. Because of [this imposition the struggle for
the emancipation of a]{.mark} certain [class, race, gender, sexual
identity]{.mark} can serve as a means for rebellion and emancipation,
but [ultimately]{.mark} it [contradicts the social metamorphosis
necessary for truly revolutionary changes. Identity politics is
revolutionary only if]{.mark}, paradoxically, is committed to [the
abolition of identity]{.mark}, that [is focused on
self-destruction]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Emancipation sets as its goal freedom of identity, freedom to be who
you "really are", liberation is revolutionary and seeks freedom of
self-determination and self-transformation, freedom to determine who we
can be]{.underline}

In other words, [[identity politics]{.mark} in itself implies the
struggle against social subordination, its [aim is empowerment]{.mark}
of the oppressed identity, but [not]{.mark} the struggle aimed at
[transformation and self-elimination]{.mark} of identity. Any identity
that is established and empowered, becomes dominant.]{.underline}

A revolutionary politics can start with the [emancipation of identity,
since all the revolutionary movements, as Negri and Hardt believe, are
launched by the struggle against the oppression of a certain identity,
but but cannot end there.]{.underline}

Negri and Hardt explain this as follows:

"[Black nationalism in the United States, for example, which takes
inspiration from the anticolonial struggles and their goals of national
liberation, is seldom configured in territorial terms but is aimed
rather at the sovereignty of the racial identity, which implies
separation and self-determination, controlling the economy of the
community, policing the community, and so forth]{.underline}. It is easy
to think of certain streams of [feminist politics that are characterized
similarly by gender nationalism, or gay and lesbian politics by gay and
lesbian nationalisms, and there is a long and complex history of worker
politics that takes the form of worker nationalism. The metaphor of
nation]{.underline}, in each of the cases, [refers to the relative
separation of the community from the society as a whole and suggests the
construction of a sovereign people. All these nationalisms, in contrast
to the multiculturalist struggles for recognition, are combative
formations that constantly rebel against structures of subordination.
Such nationalisms do, however, end up reinforcing the fixity of
identity. Every nationalism is a disciplinary formation that enforces
obedience to the rules of identity, policing the behavior of members of
the community and their separation from others]{.underline}."

The task of identity politics is to render violence and subordination
visible, rebel against them and struggle for for emancipation, but after
that one cannot return to an emancipated identity and dwell on it. To
become revolutionary, identity politics must find a way to keep moving
forward. The task of liberation prevents annihilation of the
revolutionary movement and keeps the rebellious function of identity,
leading identity politics to the revolutionary project: its
self-abolition.

Negri and Hardt introduce a conditional distinction between emancipatory
and revolutionary feminism. The former is aimed at consolidating and
empowering of the identity of a woman, the latter is aimed at abolishing
of a woman as identity.

Donna Haraway describes such revolutionary project as "[the Utopian
dream of \[. . .\] a monstrous world without gender.]{.underline}" A
revolutionary project goes beyond the purely reformist perspective of
emancipation: instead of the goal of preserving sexual differentiation,
while depriving it of its hierarchy (here lies a trap, because
identification based on sexual differentiation itself implies
hierarchy), the revolutionary project seeks to abolish identification
based on sexual differentiation as such. This does not mean that all
differences will be erased, monstrosity carries the potential of new
differences, but nothing that we now recognize as gender.

Negri and Hardt simultaneously flirt with identity politics, asserting
its necessity and criticize it. They resort to a subtle tactic,
explaining that every time they claim that revolutionary stage must
follow the struggle of identity politics, do it only for the sake of
convenience, while in reality, the task of emancipation and the task of
liberation must be carried out simultaneously, since there is the risk
that a revolutionary project will be postponed indefinitely.

Considering all the absurdity of this tactic (the identity politics is
necessary, but only for its self-abolishment), one should think about
whether the need of such a tactic is the result of the identity politics
in action: identity politics which not only postpones the revolutionary
project to infinity, but fundamentally opposes it. Negri and Hardt
idealize (are forced to?) identity politics, suggesting that it can
voluntarily commit suicide.

What indicates a dominant position is a ban on criticism. Maybe
something is wrong with feminism, since in today's world it cannot be
directly criticized? If one doesn't resort to such tactics, she will be
automatically considered to be an accomplice of patriarchy, with all the
ensuing consequences in the form of social ostracism.

For [Negri and Hardt, [the most obvious revolutionary form of identity
politics is queer politics]{.mark}, since [it]{.mark} inextricably
[links identity politics with criticism of identity. Queer is not an
identity, but]{.mark} rather [a process of disidentification]{.mark},
that is, [destabilization of an identity that is not interested in its
consolidation or stabilization]{.mark}. The question arises if queer
politics should be considered a form of identity politics, or maybe it
is an independent revolutionary phenomenon opposing it?]{.underline}

It should be noted, however[, that the term ["queer" is]{.mark}
increasingly [used in public discourse]{.mark} not as a critique of
identity, but [as one of the identity categories]{.mark} technically
[included in LGBT community, such understanding]{.mark} of it
[deprives]{.mark} the term "[queer" of its monstrous revolutionary
potential]{.mark}, reducing it to emancipation.]{.underline}

[[Identities can be emancipated and empowered, but only queer monsters
can liberate themselves.]{.mark} The reverse side of the struggle for
the assertion of identity is the trauma of oppression (one can even
claim that it forms this identity). The identity politics acts "on
behalf" of the trauma and carries the risk of full reduction of a
self-determination process to it. The primary mode of such acting is
purely reactive, it's motivated by a justified desire to take revenge on
a universalized source of trauma]{.underline}.

[[Monsters act differently, they do not reduce themselves to an existing
trauma and do not act on its behalf. Being a monster means to proceed on
an endless journey of searching]{.mark} for a new [trauma]{.mark}tic
[]{.mark}experience (what is new is inevitably traumatic).]{.underline}

"This revolutionary process of the abolition of identity, we should keep
in mind, is monstrous, violent, and traumatic. [[Don't try to save
yourself]{.mark} --- in fact, your [self has, to be sacrificed]{.mark}!
This does not mean that liberation casts us into an indifferent sea with
no objects of identification, but rather the existing identities will no
longer serve as anchors.]{.underline} Many will pull back from the brink
and try to stay who they are rather than dive into the unknown waters of
a world without race, gender, or other identity formations. Abolition
also requires the destruction of all the institutions of the corruption
of the common \[...\], such as the family, the corporation, and the
nation[. T[his involves]{.underline}]{.mark} [an often [violent battle
against the ruling powers]{.mark} and also, since these institutions in
part define who we now are, an operation surely more painful than
bloodshed. Revolution is not for the faint of heart. It is for monsters.
[You have to lose who you are to discover what you can
become]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Negri and Hardt).

[By [placing queer intellectual curiosity about]{.mark} figurations of
\"[homosexuality]{.mark}\" and \"the homosexual\" at its methodological
core, my proposed [Queer IR methods refuse to take for granted
personal-to-international institutional arrangements]{.mark},
figurations of \"homosexuality\" and \"the homosexual,\" attachments
(and detachments) of these figurations to/from material bodies, [and the
mobilization of sexualized bodies in international
politics]{.mark}.]{.underline} This article makes three key points. [[It
demonstrates the historical instability]{.mark} of figurations of
\"homosexuality\" and \"the homosexual\" [by illustrating how discourses
of power]{.mark}/knowledge/plea- sure [put sex into discourse to figure
\"homosexuality\" and \"the homosexual\" as perverse]{.mark} (for
Victorians), normal (for the Obama administration), and normal and/or
per- verse (for Neuwirth and/as Wurst). It shows how [figurations of
\"the homosexual]{.mark}\" (might) [function as both a singular logos
and a plural logoi of statecraft]{.mark} as mancraft. And it makes clear
how figurations of \"[the homosexual\" participate in both the
deconstruction and construction of political communities and
international orders]{.mark}. Because figurations of \"the homosexual\"
and other potentially plural logoi - from the variously normalized
(Towns 2010) to the variously stigmatized (Zarakol 2011; Adler-Nissen
2014) - affect the organization and regulation of international
politics, they constitute important objects/subjects of study in
IR]{.underline}. Rather than detracting from the serious business of
analyzing international practice and producing IR theory, investigating
these figurations furthers understandings of core IR concerns. For
example, Adler-Nissen\' s insightful analysis of Austria\'s rejection of
stigma is complicated by the Austrian state\'s embrace of the pluralized
normal and/or perverse figure of Neuwirth and/ as Wurst. This plural
figure calls schemata of stigmatization themselves into question.
[[It]{.mark} thereby [erodes and displaces how \"stigmatization helps
clarify the boundaries of acceptable behavior and identity and the
consequences of nonconformity]{.mark}\" for states (Adler-Nissen
2014:149). Additionally, [understandings of human rights]{.mark} that
equate \"the norm\" and \"the normal\" with \"the good\" and \"the
beneficial\" (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998) [are complicated by Queer IR
analyses of \"homonormative\" foreign policies]{.mark}]{.underline} -
such as those of the Obama administration. For [[these analyses expose
the (potential) violence of not just excluding plural subjects but also
including plural subjects as singular subjects.]{.mark} These practical,
empirical concerns deepen IR understandings of state and nation
formation, human rights policy, and diplomacy more generally[. Yet they
cannot be interrogated if IR excludes from its consideration plural
logoi and logics, or if IR reduces them to a singular logos or
logic]{.mark}. IR methods that attempt to analyze plural figures as if
they were historically static or singular - either by reducing them to a
variable or by analyzing them exclusively through an \"either/or logic\"
of statecraft as mancraft - miss opportunities to appreciate what
plural(s) constitute(s) these figures and how plural (s) make and unmake
national, regional, and international political communities that anchor
various arrangements of international hierarchy and anarchy. [The Queer
IR methods proposed]{.mark} here [provide techniques, devices, and
research questions to investigate singular and plural figurations,
including those of \"the homosexual.]{.mark}\" It thus offers ways to
further IR analyses seeking to investigate how both a singular logos and
a plural logoi effect the conduct of international politics]{.underline}

[Like SSM, [anti-gay laws can also be seen as global sites of both
dispute and]{.mark} (ironically) [celebration]{.mark}. How hegemonic
states respond to anti-gay laws fascinating in itself]{.underline}:
David Cameron has publicly linked countries\' LGBT rights record
directly to UK foreign aid conditionality. Likewise, former Secretary of
State [[Hillary Clinton has linked LGBT rights to countries\'
\"democratic records,]{.mark}" and]{.underline} the US AID Global LGBT
Development Partnership is now the largest state-sponsored initiative of
its kind. Uganda, in particular, has been threatened with foreign aid
suspension due to the passage of the 2014 Homosexuality Act, which
broadens the criminalization of same-sex including life in prison for
those found guilty and penalties for activist groups that support LGBT
rights. Indeed, while the brutality of the law fortunately was dismissed
by Uganda\'s Supreme Court, merits a response has to ask \"why Uganda?\"
and not other countries. Interestingly, when Cameron and Obama were
faced with international pressure to boycott the 20 Olympics following
the passage of Russia\'s \"gay propaganda\" law, both publicly opposed a
boycott. Cameron stated, \"I believe we can better address prejudice if
we attend, not by boycotting\...\" (Xydias 2013); Obama opted not to
attend himself but invited LGBT celebrities to be part of the US
delegation. Threats suspension or boycotts are seen as exceptionalist
when clearly neither the UK nor the United States have achieved such
\"modernization\" at home. [[How]{.mark}, then, [can scholar]{.mark}s
and activists best [navigate these political landscapes and understand
the ambivalent nature of globalized queer visibility?]{.mark} Here I
offer three preliminary thoughts: First, [recognizing how queer
visibility becomes a tool of hegemony and empire is key]{.mark}: As
I\'ve outlined above, queer visibility in global arenas has brought with
it a series of paradoxes that involve the legitimization of a \"new gay
normal\"]{.underline} (read: Western, middle class, white, masculine,
gender-normative) [over all else, and which often serves as fodder for
broader struggles for/against colonialism, westernization, and
empire]{.underline}. Rao (2012) has described this tension as involving
those who claim to be on the \"right side of history" (the normative
move toward global gay rights, launched primarily by Wes and global
institutions) vs. those who are simply \"on the wrong side of empire",
including queers in countries deemed \"uncivil,\" \"dangerous,\" or
\"backward" according to hegemonic standards. Being \"on the right side
of history", implies, then, serving empire as well. [Currently, [this
\"new gay normal\" is]{.mark} being [played out in fo]{.mark}reign
[po]{.mark}licy[, security, and development arenas and is embedded in
state]{.mark} as well as market ideologies [linking gays to growth and
neoliberal modernity]{.mark}. Second, [because states and global
institutions are now finally \"paying attention to
us]{.mark}\"]{.underline} (Scott Long, quoted in Rao 2012), [bringing
heightened visibility to LGBT rights[, it is imperative that \"we\" pay
attention to states and global institutions as they continue to
legislate]{.mark}, advocate, [and]{.mark}/or construct [discourses
concerning LBGT rights]{.mark} in a global context- this being only one,
albeit important aspect of thinking "queerly" and critically in our
queries of IR. [Major groundwork has been done to understand how hetero-
and homonormativities are embedded in state practices of
securitizatio]{.mark}n]{.underline} (for example, Weber, Duggan, or
Puar) and law and policy making (for example, Weiss and Bosia), yet
[[much needs to be carried out to better understand how and why states
craft both homophobic and homopositive strategies as they relate to
their national political economies]{.mark} as well as their positions
vis-à-vis other states and regions, [and to address the very real
consequences of]{.mark} pro and anti [LGBT rights discourse in people's
lives. ]{.mark}]{.underline}This certainly applies to nonstate
communities as well (for example, Palestine) and to nonhegemonic states
that invoke a heteronormative notion of nationalism (for example,
Ecuador, Cuba). Finally, although here I have focused on queer
visibility in relation to state practices, it is crucial, of course,
that we pay attention to how other hegemonic institutions such as
institutions of global finance and development convey heteronormative
and/or homonormative logics in their supposedly neutral (and/or
modernization) discourse, with very real effects for citizens and policy
recipients (Cornwall, Correa, and Jolly 2008; Bedford 2009; Lind 2010).
The World Bank\'s suspension of US \$90 million in aid to Uganda in
March 2014 is a case in point, alongside the Bank\'s \"Economic Cost of
Homophobia\" project, which aims to monetize the cost of discrimination
and link it to aid distribution, economic growth, and modernization.
[While [advances in LGBT rights]{.mark} [are important steps]{.mark} the
political messiness of [queer visibility offers IR scholars an
opportunity to think more critically about how state practices
contribute to and indeed power fully shape the (hetero)normative
landscape]{.mark} in which we conceptualize our work.]{.underline}
