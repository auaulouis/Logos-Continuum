[[By significant margins, Americans]{.mark} now [view the Republican
Party as better than the Dem]{.mark}ocratic Party [on]{.mark} two key
issues: [protecting]{.mark} the nation [from international threats
an]{.mark}d ensuring the nation\'s [economic prosperity]{.mark}, a new
poll found]{.underline}.¶ [[More than half of Americans]{.mark}, 54%,
[believe]{.mark} that [the GOP will]{.mark} [do]{.mark} a
[better]{.mark} job than the Democratic Party [at protecting the
nation]{.mark} [from]{.mark} international [terrorism and]{.mark}
military threats]{.underline} in the next few years, according to a
Gallup
[survey](https://news.gallup.com/poll/355511/gop-viewed-better-party-security-prosperity.aspx)
released Wednesday, while just 39% believe the Democratic Party is
better suited to do so. About [50% of Americans likewise believe that
the Republican Party will do a better job at [keeping the country
prosperous]{.mark}]{.underline}, while 41% believe the same about
Democrats. [The two GOP advantages mark the largest gaps in more than
five years.]{.underline}¶ The survey, conducted between Sept. 1-17,
comes after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, which Americans
generally supported in theory, but not in the \"chaotic and deadly way
in which it was executed,\" an earlier [Gallup
poll](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2021-09-22/with-the-honeymoon-phase-far-behind-him-bidens-approval-hits-new-low)
notes. The polling also came amid a weaker than expected employment
[report](https://www.usnews.com/news/economy/articles/2021-09-03/employers-added-a-dismal-235-000-jobs-in-august-compared-to-750-000-forecast),
and surging coronavirus infections.¶ But when it comes to what Americans
deem to be the most important problem facing the country, most commonly
the coronavirus and the handling of the government itself, Americans are
nearly split on which party can better handle the issues, with 41%
believing the Republican Party can do so, and 38% the Democratic Party.
However, those who listed the coronavirus as the top issue facing the
country widely say the Democratic Party is more equipped to handle it,
while [those who said the government is the top issue are more inclined
to believe the Republican Party is better suited to handle the
situation]{.underline}.¶

[WASHINGTON, D.C. \-- Americans by significant margins now view the
[Republican Party]{.mark} as [better]{.mark} than the Democratic Party
[at protecting the nation from international threats]{.mark} (54% to
39%, respectively) and at ensuring the nation remains prosperous (50% to
41%).]{.underline} The 15-percentage-point GOP advantage on security
matters is its largest since 2015, while its nine-point edge on
prosperity is its largest since 2014. Last year, the GOP had a narrow
advantage on international matters while the parties were essentially
tied on economic matters[. More of this change has come from [declines
in]{.mark} Americans perceiving [the Democratic Party]{.mark} as better
on these issues than from increases for the]{.underline} Republican
Party. Meanwhile, the public is narrowly divided (41% Republican Party,
38% Democratic Party) as to which party can better handle whichever
issue it deems the most important facing the country. Americans most
commonly name the coronavirus pandemic or the government itself as the
most important problem. [[The]{.mark} [latest results]{.mark} are from
Gallup\'s annual Governance survey, conducted Sept. 1-17. The survey was
[conducted]{.mark} just [after]{.mark} the [chaotic U.S. withdrawal from
Afghanistan]{.mark} and amid heightened numbers of coronavirus
infections and a weaker-than-expected U.S. employment
report.]{.underline} Protection From International Threats The 39% of
Americans saying the Democratic Party will do a better job in the next
few years of protecting the U.S. from terrorism and other international
threats is down significantly from 46% last year. At the same time,
there has been a smaller increase in the percentage of U.S. adults
perceiving the Republican Party as better in this area, from 50% to 54%.

Party]{.mark} is [better and 39% say the Democratic Party is.]{.mark}
The [Republican Party has led most]{.mark} years except 2007 and 2012.
Its advantages had typically been in the single digits from 2016 through
2020 before expanding this year to 15 points. Americans typically see
the Republican Party as more capable on national security matters, but
the 15-point gap in favor of the GOP]{.underline} this year is the
largest since a 16-point advantage in 2015. The party had an even larger
23-point gap in 2014, a time when the Obama administration was
struggling to deal with the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and
renewed Middle East violence (IMPORTANR), among other issues. Keeping
the U.S. Prosperous As is the case on international matters, there has
been a seven-point drop in the percentage of Americans who say the
Democratic Party is better able to keep the U.S. prosperous, from 48% to
41%. Now, 50% say the Republican Party is better, compared with 47% in
2020. Republicans have had at least a small advantage on this for most
of the past decade, with the current nine-point lead tying 2011 and 2014
as the largest for the GOP during this period. The only years since 2010
that Republicans have not led are 2012 and 2020, the two years in which
Democratic candidates were elected president. The last time that at
least half of U.S. adults said the Republicans were better at keeping
the country prosperous was in 1989, although there have been several
measures of 48% or 49% since then. Line graph. [[Americans\'

[able to keep the United States prosperous. In 2021, 50% say the
Republican]{.mark} [Party]{.mark} would be better and 41% say the
Democratic Party would be.]{.underline} The Republican Party has led
most years since 2010 except 2012 and 2018. From 1992 through 2009, the
Democratic Party typically led. Republicans led between 1988 and 1991.
From 1992 through 2009, Americans typically said the Democratic Party
was better at keeping the country prosperous, including advantages
ranging between 11 and 20 points the last four years of that period.
Those latter years spanned the housing market crash, the financial
crisis and the Great Recession, which began while Republican George W.
Bush was president. Handling the \'Most Important Problem\' By 41% to
38%, U.S. adults say the Republican Party rather than the Democratic
Party can better handle whichever problem they name (in an open-ended
question format) as the most important facing the country. Last year,
47% said the Democratic Party and 39% said the Republican Party could
better address the most important problem, when the coronavirus
pandemic, the government and race relations were most commonly named as
that issue. This year, again, the coronavirus pandemic and government
rank as the top two problems. [In both 2020 and now, those identifying
the coronavirus as the most important problem widely say the Democratic
Party can better handle it, including a 57% to 28% Democratic edge this
year.]{.underline} By contrast, those naming the government as the top
problem are much more inclined to say the Republican Party can better
handle it (60% to 19%), whereas last year, when President Donald Trump
was in office, more said the Democratic Party could (51% to 44%). To a
large degree, this shift reflects wide party differences this year in
perceptions that the government is the most important problem, with 31%
of Republicans but only 9% of Democrats naming it. Last year, 29% of
both Democrats and Republicans said the government was the most
important problem. Historically, Democrats have more often had an edge
in terms of being perceived as better able to handle whichever problem
Americans think is most important. However, opinions have mostly been
closely divided. The largest advantage for either party came in 2006 and
2007, when Democrats held leads of 17 and 15 points, respectively, at a
time when Americans considered the war in Iraq to be the top problem.
Line graph. [Americans\' perceptions of which political party can better
handle whichever problem they think is the most important facing the
country. Forty-one percent say the Republican Party can better handle
that problem, while 38% say the Democratic Party can and 20% do not see
either party as better. Democrats have usually led on this though the
advantages have been small in most years.]{.underline} Independents
[Primarily Behind Expanded GOP Advantages]{.underline} As might be
expected, Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly view their preferred
party as better able to handle the most important problem, to keep the
country safe from international threats and to keep the country
prosperous. Thus, when perceptions of which party is better able to
handle these issues change, as occurred this year, independents are
usually behind those shifts. Since last year, there have been
double-digit declines in the percentages of independents who say the
Democratic Party is better at handling the most important problem (from
42% to 31%), at keeping the nation secure (from 43% to 31%) and at
keeping the nation prosperous (from 47% to 35%). Republicans\' gains on
these same issues have been smaller, as some independents have shifted
to saying neither party is better able to handle these issues. There has
been an eight-point increase among independents in saying the Republican
Party is better at keeping the country prosperous (from 43% to 51%), a
five-point increase for keeping the nation secure (from 48% to 53%) and
a nonsignificant two-point change on the most important problem (from
29% to 31%). Bottom Line [Americans now generally see the Republican
Party as better than the Democratic Party at handling two key government
objectives \-- protecting citizens from international threats and
promoting a strong economy.]{.underline} Despite these issue advantages,
the Democratic Party still maintains a slight edge in overall
favorability, as it has for nearly all of the past decade even as the
GOP has typically led on these issue measures. [These results,
therefore, suggest the Republican Party has not been able to translate
its competence edge on key issues to a more positive image of the party
overall.]{.underline} While advantages in party favorability and
perceived issue competence are desirable heading into next year\'s
midterm elections, it is not clear that either will be necessary to
achieve success. In the last three midterm elections, neither party had
a significant edge in favorability, but Democrats had a strong showing
in 2018 and the [Republicans did in 2010 and 2014. And while Republicans
had advantages in perceived handling of national security and the
economy in 2010 and 2014, they also did in 2018.]{.underline} Most
often, performance in midterm elections hinges on the popularity of the
incumbent president at the time of the election. With Joe Biden in
office and his approval rating slumping, unless it improves
substantially over the next year, Republicans would likely gain seats in
Congress in next year\'s elections, and control of one or both chambers
of Congress.
