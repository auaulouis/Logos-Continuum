### Alt - Forget IR Theory

#### The alternative is to [forget]{.underline}\-\--that escapes the vicious circle that gave rise to [hegemonic practices]{.underline}. That enables a [tabula rasa]{.underline} of the consciousness that offers opportunities to think and act [beyond]{.underline} the confines of our [desolate]{.underline} present.

[[To forget]{.underline}]{.mark} orthodox [[IR]{.mark} theory [is not to
ignore]{.mark} the IR [practices that have framed our
realities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Countless [events of the past, such as
the Holocaust, cannot and should not be simply chased out of our
collective memory. Nor is it to turn a blind eye toward the violent
nature that characterizes present world politics. [Forgetting is]{.mark}
not only a negative process, a neglecting and overlooking, but also a
**[necessary]{.mark} part of our existence**, something we often do
without being aware of it]{.underline}. Jeanette Winterson: They say
that every snowflake is different. If that were true, how could we go
on? How could we ever get up and off our knees? How could we ever
recover from the wonder of it? By forgetting. [We cannot keep in mind
too many things. There is only the present and nothing to
remember]{.underline}.5 The task, then, becomes one of [[turning
forgetting from a]{.mark} selective, arbitrary, and [unconscious
constitution of things]{.mark} past [into **an active, conscious, and
more inclusive process**]{.mark}. Instead of perpetuating IR nostalgia,
seeking comfort and security in the familiar interpretation of long-gone
epochs, even if they are characterized by violence and insecurity,
**[conscious forgetting opens up possibilities for a dialogical
understanding of our present and past]{.mark}.** It refuses to tie
future possibilities to established forms of life. Rather than further
entrenching current IR security dilemmas by **engaging with the orthodox
discourse that continuously gives meaning to them,** [forgetting tries
to **escape the vicious circle by which these social practices serve to
legitimize**]{.mark} **and objectivize [the]{.mark} very [discourses
that have given rise to them]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.** [Forgetting
becomes [an **instrument of dialogue and inclusion**]{.mark}; [it
**reorients** our memories]{.mark}, becomes active by turning into
forge(t) and for(to)get. From this vantage point]{.underline},
forgetting is a process or remembering, or, seen from Milan Kundera\'s
reversed perspective, \"[**[remembering is a form of
forgetting]{.mark}**.\"]{.underline} I will draw primarily upon the work
of Friedrich Nietzsche to explore the process of forgetting orthodox IR
theory. This is not to essentialize Nietzsche or render him heroic but
to employ his work as a steppingstone, a source to provoke thought
before it, too, has to be forgotten in order not to turn into a new
orthodoxy. [The process of forgetting]{.underline}, for Nietzsche, [is
[a process of healing]{.mark}]{.underline}: [Only now do I believe you
healed: for healed is who forgot]{.underline}.7 Nietzsche ended up with
this position by dealing with a set of methodological dilemmas similar
to those I am trying to address in this article. [The need to forget
emerges from recognizing the problematic links that are commonly drawn
between cause and effect]{.underline}. Such a duality, Nietzsche claims,
probably never existed. [[We]{.mark} merely [establish]{.mark} arbitrary
[links between things that we consider important]{.mark}, isolate a
couple of pieces out of a continuum of complex and intertwined
events.]{.underline} [This is why it is futile to search for a causal
origin in this web of human life and to think we could somehow ground a
better world on this form of flawed insight.]{.underline} \"How foolish
it would be,\" Nietzsche claims, \"to suppose that one only needs to
point out this origin and this misty shroud of delusion in order to
destroy the world that counts for real, so-called \"reality. \"8
Nietzsche\'s skepticism toward grounding critique in an investigation of
the origins of things is important. It is one of the reasons why some
consider his work as the conceptual turning point from modernity to
postmodernity.9 Nietzsche\'s own words may explain best the importance
of forgetting for a critique of orthodox IR: **[[Why is it that]{.mark}
this [thought comes back to me again and again]{.mark} and [in ever more
varied colours]{.mark}?]{.underline}** - that formerly, when
investigators of knowledge sought out the origin of things they always
believed they would discover something of incalculable significance for
all later action and judgment, that they always presupposed, indeed,
that the salvation of man must depend on insight into the ongins of
things, but . . . The more insight we possess into an ongin the less
significant does the ongin appear: while what is nearest to us, what is
around us and in us, gradually begins to display colors and beauties and
enigmas and riches of significance of which earlier mankind had not an
inkling.10 By observing why Nietzsche ended up with this position, I
will explore the [[\"riches of significance\"]{.mark} that **[could
emerge once we liberate IR theory from the compulsion to link the search
for peace with exploring the origins of present dilemmas in world
politics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I will then retrace Nietzsche\'s next
step, an engagement with what he calls [\"**[active
forgetfulness]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,\" a way of thinking that
[enables \"a tabula rasa of the consciousness]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\"
makes room for new things, new thoughts, new possibilities.11 My
approach to [[forgetting IR]{.mark} theory [will revolve]{.mark}
primarily [around]{.mark} issues of [language]{.mark}: how they
constrain and enable, **[how they are part of]{.mark} a discursive form
of [domination a]{.mark}nd, at the same time, [offer]{.mark} powerful
[opportunities to think and act beyond the narrow confines of
our]{.mark} present [world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In that sense, my
article deals with methodological concerns - with what conventionally is
considered form rather than substance. [Yet, the manner in which we
approach, think, conceptualize, and formulate IR has a significant
impact on how it is practiced. Language frames politics. Form turns into
substance.]{.underline}

### L - Islamophobia

#### Islamophobia shapes US foreign policy. Notions of western superiority are a critical tool that drum up support for broader militarism

Deepa **Kumar 13,** is an Associate Professor of Media Studies and
Middle Eastern Studies at the Rutgers University. She is the author of
Islamophobia and the Politics of Empire and Outside the Box: Corporate
Media, Globalization, and the UPS Strike being interviewed by Jessica
Desvarieux, The Real News Network, "Twelve Years Post 9/11, Islamophobia
Still Runs High",
http://truth-out.org/video/item/18759-twelve-years-post-9-11-islamophobia-still-runs-high

KUMAR: Absolutely not. I think [it is true that]{.underline} [larger
numbers of conservative voters are racist]{.underline}. They are racist
not just in terms of their attitude towards Arabs and South Asians, but
also to a whole host of other groups. So it\'s true that this idea sort
of concentrated within those ranks. But in fact **[Islamophobia is far
more systemic than that]{.underline}**. That is to say, [the idea of a
Muslim enemy]{.underline}, [the idea of a terrorist enemy is one that
actually goes back a couple of decades but was brought to light after
9/11 by the political elite]{.underline}, by our political leaders. So
in fact **[it]{.underline}** **[is built into the system of U.S. foreign
policy]{.underline}** **[in this country.]{.underline}** And [to simply
look at the far right and]{.underline} [to ignore the fact that it has
larger implications in terms of justifying U.S. foreign policy would
be]{.underline} [really to have only]{.underline} [an incomplete picture
of what is at work in this form of racism.]{.underline} DESVARIEUX:
Okay. Let\'s talk about the mass media and how they depict Islam since
9/11. Can you describe for us how the mass media has depicted Islam?
KUMAR: Well, basically, [the trauma of]{.underline} [9/11]{.underline},
the fact that, you know, 3,000 Americans died meant that it [enabled the
U.S.]{.underline} [media]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [actually]{.underline} [draw
on stereotypes]{.underline} [that have been]{.underline}, you
know, [propped up by Hollywood, by the news media, and so on for a few
decades]{.underline} before that. And [that was the
idea]{.underline} [that these are crazy, irrational people. They are all
apparently driven by Islam to violence]{.underline}. And [so we should
lock them up,]{.underline} [we should be suspicious of them, we
should]{.underline} [detain them]{.underline} [at airports, and so
on]{.underline} [and so forth.]{.underline} And so that\'s what you saw
in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. And this show called 24, which your
viewers may know, is\--[it\'s about a lot of
things]{.underline} \[incompr.\] that [it\'s
about]{.underline} **[justifying the building of a national security
state]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[justifying practices like
torture]{.underline}** [and so on and so forth.]{.underline} DESVARIEUX:
Okay. And also the story of the day, of course, is Syria, and
everyone\'s attention is drawn to Syria. Can you describe for us just
how does Islamophobia play a role in any of the arguments for
intervention in Syria, really? KUMAR: Okay. It doesn\'t play a direct
role in that. It is\--[the idea of humanitarianism has a long history in
the United States. The idea that there are victims all over the world,
that the U.S. government has then got to make war in order
to]{.underline}, you know, [somehow defend them]{.underline}, this [goes
back all the way to the Spanish-American war]{.underline} of 1898, which
was supposed to be about rescuing Cubans. And similarly, [you see these
sorts of justifications given]{.underline}. You know, Vietnamese need to
be defended. [In Iraq, it was babies]{.underline}, apparently, [who were
being bayoneted in Kuwait]{.underline}, [and therefore the U.S. needed
to intervene and defeat Iraq in 1991]{.underline}. So this idea of
humanitarianism has a long history within the foreign policy
establishment. But [what makes it particularly potent in this case is
that after 9/11 what]{.underline} [you
see]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [Bush]{.underline} [administration]{.underline} [**projecting
this idea of clash of civilizations**,]{.underline} [which
is]{.underline} [basically]{.underline} [the notion that we in the West
are democratic, we are]{.underline} [rational, we
are]{.underline} [civilized, we are]{.underline}, you know, [all things
wonderful, and they in the East are barbaric,
they\'re]{.underline} [misogynistic, and so on and so
forth]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} therefore [we have an obligation,
what used to be called the white man\'s burden, to go off and rescue
them.]{.underline} And so you see some of that language, which is the
idea that Arabs cannot bring democracy by themselves, they cannot make
change, and so we need to intervene. So **[it\'s a
combination]{.underline}** **[both]{.underline}** **[of the victim
narrative, which has a long history,]{.underline}** **[combined with
this language of clash of civilizations.]{.underline}** DESVARIEUX:
Okay. And how does this fit into domestic policy? How do they work
Islamophobia into domestic policy? KUMAR: Right. I mean, the comparison
I make in the book and that I\'m actually working on in the next book is
that [the
U.S.]{.underline} [government,]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [U.S.]{.underline} [imperialism]{.underline} [in
particular,]{.underline} **[always needs an enemy]{.underline}**. That
is, [when there is no humanitarian cause,]{.underline} [an enemy
is]{.underline} [an]{.underline} [extremely]{.underline} [useful]{.underline} [way]{.underline} [**to
justify wars abroad**,]{.underline} **[as well as the policing of
dissent at home]{.underline}**. So, for instance, during the Cold War we
had been menacing enemy of the Soviet Union, against whom both a hot and
a Cold War had to be waged. And, of course, this justified, then,
McCarthyism, because there\'s always a reflection of the external enemy
inside, and these people have to be rounded up, blacklisted, and so on
and so forth. So that\'s the logic back then, and, of course, it was
entirely about a politics of fear. Today [we have the same sort of
thing]{.underline}. [After 9/11, the war on terror comes
into]{.underline} **[being precisely about fighting endless
wars.]{.underline}** Remember, [back in 9/11 the Bush administration was
going to start with Afghanistan, go to Iraq, and then Iran, Syria, and
so on and so forth]{.underline}. It didn\'t work out that way.
But [**the idea was to drum up this fear of this menacing terrorist
enemy**, which justified wars all over the world in order to gain the
U.S.\'s interest in]{.underline} \[incompr.\] [particularly in the
oil-rich region in the Middle East.]{.underline} You asked me about
domestic politics. Always there was a reflection of the domestic in
terms of the international threat. And so what you\'ve seen is innocent
Muslims\--and often actually not even Muslims, people from the Middle
East, North Africa and South Asia, some of them Sikhs, some some of them
Hindus, some of them Christians, and so on, being racially profiled
because that is the logic that comes out of this. I have a whole chapter
in the book about how the legal system has been reworked so as to
justify things like indefinite detention, things like torture, things
like deportation. And, frankly, the infiltration of agents into our
schools, into my school, into colleges, and so forth. So, you
know, **[it\'s truly horrific the extent to which
Muslim]{.underline}** **[Americans and people who look Muslim have been
demonized since 9/11.]{.underline}**

### L - Militarization/Expansionism

#### The 1ac is a politic of territorialization that perpetuates the logic of coloniality---carving out spaces of control and the desire for complete control and visibility is a key tool of statecraft that justifies the basis for continual acts of Islamophobic violence

[The world we live]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [is visualised
in]{.underline} [terms of
a]{.underline} **[geography]{.underline}** [bequeathed]{.underline} to
us [by]{.underline} Early Modern and **[Enlightenment
cartography]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} [established
by]{.underline} the exercise of an Euroepan imperium and
its [construction of a]{.underline} **[world
order]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[metropolitian
nation-states]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[colonies]{.underline}**.
In this world system, primary and legitimate actors were European states
organized around cultivation of core nationalities (French, British,
Dutch...). The dismantling of the European colonial empires meant the
idea of nation-states become global, but only few nationalities were
considered to be epistemological privileged. These epistemological
privileged states became the leading producers of knowledge. As Ramon
Grofoguel points out the global cannon is based on work of writers from
six European countries. Eurocentrism is simultaneously national, racial
and global. Social relations that do not morph around the nation-state
are marginal. Thus, a national/nationalist methodology elaborates social
relations as being contained within boundaries of basically an
Enlightenment cartography. By using the example of Muslims as a
globalized population that is not contained within any nation-state, we
will explore the continuities and discontinuities between social
relations mediated through virtual space and social relations
spatialized geographically. The spatial dimension of social relations
has historically been conceived in terms of attempts to overcome
distance. The range of social relations is contained by the ability to
transcend space through the development of transportation and
communications. The process of territorialisation describes the way in
which organised human endeavour creates a container for the exercise of
a myriad of social interactions.\[5\] The boundaries of this container
are determined by the interplay between environment, logistical
technologies and strategic awareness. Hunter-gather bands, agrarian
villages, cultic associations, polities, trade routes and networks;
construct a different form of territorialisation in which activity in
the interior is marked as different in the expenditure of resources than
activity in the exterior. Thus, [space occurs as a
void]{.underline} [which needs to be overcome through]{.underline} **[a
web of social relations]{.underline}**, and this web is [borne on an
assemblage of]{.underline} **[technologies of
communications]{.underline}** and transportation (alphabetic scripts,
organised commissariats, ocean-going vessels, railways etc.). Modes of
transmission create territories by overcoming space.\[6\] In other
words, human communities transform the spatial dimension of power into
enclosed spaces (Buzan & Little, 2000). [The spatial dimension
of]{.underline} human [interactions can be analysed not only through
the]{.underline} **[institution of the state]{.underline}**, [but also
through various forms of the]{.underline} **[spatialization of
power]{.underline}**, including the bounded experience of
hunter-gatherer bands, nomads and other forms of human association. The
staging of the political has a spatial dimension. The Spatial
Turn [This]{.underline} [organisation
of]{.underline} **[space]{.underline}**,
however, [is]{.underline} **[not merely a
site]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [enactment of
social relations but]{.underline} [rather a]{.underline} **[fundamental
element in]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}** **[constitution of
\"systems of interaction\"]{.underline}** (Soja, 1980; Giddens, 1984, p.
368). [Space]{.underline}, then, [is not a description of
the]{.underline} **[physical surface]{.underline}** occupied by
individuals, families, and communities; [it]{.underline} [is not
just]{.underline} **[terrain]{.underline}** [for political
struggles]{.underline}: palaces and assemblies, public squares, and
sacred ground, [containers
for]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[performance
of]{.underline}** **[social]{.underline}** **[ontologies]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline} [rather
the]{.underline} **[condition of possibility for the exercise of
power]{.underline}**. [Physical space
is]{.underline} **[experienced]{.underline}** [through]{.underline} **[discursive
spatialization]{.underline}** [not simply as]{.underline} **[a
pre-existing immutable reality]{.underline}** that is simply a
background to human activity. The exercise of power is not limited to
the idea of a cyberpolitics in which cyberspace is conceptualized as a
new distinctive arena of contestation where the struggle for "who gets
what, when, and how", takes place (Choucri, 2012, p. 4). This paper is
concerned not with a cyberpolitics but rather with the political, in
which, the exercise of power is constitutive of the social. **[Space is
not natural but historically and culturally
contingent]{.underline}**, [the product of]{.underline} **[social
interactions]{.underline}** [which]{.underline} **[restrain]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[enable
behaviour and beliefs]{.underline}**. As Massey suggests that we
understand space as: "Space" is created out of the vast intricacies, the
incredible complexities, of the interlocking and the non-interlocking,
and the networks of relations at every scale from local to global... all
social (and indeed physical) phenomena/activities/relations have a
spatial form and a relative spatial location" (Massey, 1992, p.
80). [The spatial turn]{.underline} within the humanities and social
sciences [abandons the]{.underline} [belief in]{.underline} [space as a
natural container in favour of investigations in the discursive
articulation of space]{.underline} (Massey, 1992; Kosmin, 2014, pp.
5-6). The process by which land and sea were spatialized are so deeply
sedimented that we can be forgiven experiencing them as part of a
natural geological reality. It is for this reason that it is the
introduction of the **[spatialization of the skies
after]{.underline}** the first world, which [provides a useful
analogy]{.underline} with the emergence of cyberspace.\[7\] Airpower and
emergence of cyberspace In 1921, Giulio Douhet (2009), an Italian
general published The Command of the Air. This book in its various
editions, is considered to be the first significant theorisation of the
air power. Douhet had served in the First World War with the Italian
Army fighting the Austro-Hungarian forces, saw the potential for the use
of warplanes as strategic rather than tactical weapons. In other words,
he was critical of the way in which air planes had been used until then
either for reconnaissance or as 'flying artillery' to attack small enemy
formations in concert with ground forces (Douhet, 2009, p. 3). Instead,
he argued that aeroplanes should be used in large 'aerial fleets' to
attack enemy cities behind the front lines occupied by land forces
(Douhet, 2009, p. 24). This strategic bombing would break the will of
the enemy of population and modern war, which needed to mobilise a large
percentage of its male citizenry, could not be sustained without popular
support. Douhet's call for independent air forces capable of bombing
enemy cities into submission depended on his spatialization of the sky.
That is, the sky became a surface of represention for the exercise of
military engagement. The sky unlike the land provided a pure geometric
plane. In which t aircraft could move in any direction; the sky was an
even surface without physical constraints or means for channelling
movement across it. Unlike armies, which are dependent on rail and road
transport, or fleets which were only able to move through connected
bodies of water of sufficient depth and scale, a mass formation of
aeroplanes would have no such restrictions. It would be able to attack
enemy infrastructure, industry and population centres without
topographical hindrance. Douhet realized that the aeroplanes\' ability
to move across the sky at speed, would lead to the transformation of the
battlefield. The distinction between civilians and soldiers would
collapse, military action would no longer be restricted to the frontline
where rival organised large armed units contend. Total wars would be
fought by the total mobilisation of all the resources of society. The
introduction of airpower would expand the battlefield so that it would
embrace the entire length and breadth of the warring states, without any
sheltered spaces where peaceful life could continue
unaffected. [Douhet's]{.underline} [theorisation of]{.underline} **[air
power]{.underline}**, [saw]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[spatialization
of the sky]{.underline}** [and the]{.underline} [emergence
of]{.underline} **[total war]{.underline}** **[as spatial and social
phenomena]{.underline}**. [The example of the way in which the sky was
spatialized]{.underline} [shows how]{.underline} **[space is
discursively articulated]{.underline}** [and how such articulations have
effects which are not
merely]{.underline} **[descriptive]{.underline}** [but]{.underline} **[constitutive]{.underline}**. [By
conceiving]{.underline} [the sky as]{.underline} [part of
the]{.underline} **[spatialization of the battlefield]{.underline}**,
Douhet and other [theoreticians]{.underline} of air power [were
instrumental in advocating]{.underline} **[new institutional
forms]{.underline}** (e.g. independent air forces), **[new
strategies]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[new conceptions of
distance and threat]{.underline}**. [The addition of air power to the
land and sea war-fighting dimensions was not
an]{.underline} **[incremental]{.underline}** [transformation
but]{.underline} [**revolutionary shift**, the influence of which
went]{.underline} **[beyond the sphere of
war-making.]{.underline}** Airpower transformed the idea of territorial
circumspection which had been central to the development of early modern
states in Eurasia. By spatializing the skies, the state becomes a
three-dimensional entity. The demarcation and regulation of the skies,
expanded the range of operations of the state. [The
sky]{.underline} [was not
simply]{.underline} **[medium]{.underline}** [for the exercise of air
power]{.underline}; **[it]{.underline}** **[becomes]{.underline}** **[part
of the]{.underline}** **[discursive activity of statecraft, i.e. the
continuous efforts necessary for making and maintaining a
state]{.underline}** (Devetak, 1995, pp. 31-33) The discourses of around
cyberspace, are often constituted in opposition to the authority of
state (e.g. phenomenon of hacktivism). The liberalism in the imaginaries
of cyberspace has several implications for the analysis of Islamophobia
in Cyberia. Imaginaries of Cyberspace
By [conceptualising]{.underline} [Cyberia not as a medium but
as]{.underline} **[space]{.underline}**, it [allows us to present the
problem of Islamophobia not
\[as\]]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [politics
of]{.underline} [representation]{.underline} [but]{.underline} [rather
as]{.underline} **[the]{.underline}** **[formation of a political
order]{.underline}**. Spatial imaginaries in the West find it very
difficult to evade the lure of Orientalism. The various representations
of cyberspace demonstrate the way in which
the **[spatial]{.underline}** **[in different
forms]{.underline}** [was]{.underline} [articulated by tropes culled
from]{.underline} the history of **[Orientalist
imaginings]{.underline}**. Descriptions of the meaning of cyberspace
have reflected broader cultural disposition among Western plutocracies
about the relationship between technology and humanity.
Such [articulations have significance for the]{.underline} **[Western
enterprise]{.underline}**, since, **[technological
reasoning]{.underline}** [has]{.underline} [been]{.underline} **[one
main marker]{.underline}** [by
which]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [West]{.underline} **[differentiated]{.underline}** [itself]{.underline} [from
the Rest]{.underline}. An approach which technology which saw in a
positive light has been tempered by the realization that technology may
undermine the human. The Western cultures also identified themselves as
being societies in which the human could be the most humane. Thus, the
tension between technology and humanity had a resonance in Western
societies. This tension between technological and the human are
reflected in main interpretations of the meaning of cyberspace. A
complex set of interpretations can be summarized for our purposes as a
dialectic between the potential of cyberspace to deliver totalitarianism
or liberation. This dialectic can be seen in the shifts in perception
about the internet in recent years. The early hopes for the cyberspace
were that it would constitute a new global republic in which dense
communications across national boundaries would further deepen the
development of global civil society able to check the arbitrary
authority of nation-states. The fantasy of Athenian polis informed some
of these accounts. This fantasy was strengthened by the way in which it
aligned with liberal beliefs in individuals bound by rational
conversations able to transcend all accretions of culture, religion,
ideology and the exercise of autonomy. The collapse in distance
transformed the problem of scale: it allowed for the exposing the idea
of minorities as an accounting exercise rather than actualities. In
other, words minorities were disclosed as an effect of boundary drawing.
Boundaries which cyberspace had the potential to unravel. This is often
presented as compression of time-space: the world becoming smaller, but
it could as easily be conceived as the expansion of our world. The range
of intimacies become bound by a conception of proximity that was global.
Everyone could be local. This localisation seemed to make it possible to
see the internet as a democratic space, outside the control of any
Leviathan. In this view, 'a wild west motif' signified cyberspace as a
place of freedom were 'hacktivists\' emerge as the vanguard of the
'anti-globalization movement (Jordan & Taylor, 2004, p. 33).\[8\] Rather
than information technologies being used to deliver a totalitarianism,
there is this view of cyberspace was a site where it was possible to
resist globalisation, commodification and homogenization. The vision of
cyberspace as a country t anti-Leviathan, however, was checked by the
revelations of Wiki-leaks. Wiki-leaks, seemed to demonstrate that the
idea that Big Brother was not watching us, or rather that the belief
that in Cyberspace there was no possibility of a Big Brother was a naive
at best and at worst delusional. It was clear that the United States and
some of its allies forced the private co-operations who peddled the
dream of individual freedom as being the defining feature of the
internet to create a crypto-infrastructure of surveillance and
regulation. Cyberia was only a Hollywood version of the ancient Greek
polis, which completely ignored the exclusionary nature of the Greek
conception of democracy, as well as for polities like Sparta- apartheid
states where the equality of the Herrenvolk was maintained by systematic
torture and oppression of the helot masses. Big Brother was watching us,
but he was just less bombastic about it, and like the citizens of
Oceania we did not have the imagination to understand our circumstances.
The investigations associated with wiki-leaks seemed re-insert
cyberspace into a familiar narrative of state formation and
resistance. [The ability]{.underline} [of the state]{.underline} [to
exercise power]{.underline} [and regulate and discipline its
population]{.underline} [was circumscribed
by]{.underline} **[topography]{.underline}**.\[9\] One of the claims
made on behalf of digitalisation was that it would overcome topography.
Wiki-leaks provided evidence that under surface of the vision of the
internet as free space open to all forms of creativity and beyond the
reach of political authority, powerful states had begun to establish
mechanisms for exerting their control over cyberspace. Cyberspace was
more centralized than it was believed. Traditionally, centralization was
a key feature of the state. Territorial centralisation; however, meant
that the remit of a central political authority was unevenly distributed
among different social sectors and spaces. Upland and densely forested
regions were often able to become a refuge for outsiders often described
as 'bandits' (from the point of view of the state). The gradual
replacement of welfare liberal democracies by national surveillance
plutocracies demonstrates the way in which state expansion has carried
out a granular colonisation of life-worlds. The virtual monopolies some
of the American companies came to exercise over the internet, also
suggested Big Brother may exist not as a state actor but as a corporate
chief executive. The idea of cyberspace as an engine of human
emancipation and expression became undermined by the way in which
strucutres of the internet were increasingly configured for profit
maximisation and thus were able to channel and commodify individual
creativity. This dialectic between centralising force of the state and
emancipatory force of hacktivism reproduces at the level of cyberspace,
the logic of liberalism. Liberalism is not a just a political creed, but
rather a family of philosophical orientations which enjoy hegemonic
global status. What unites liberalism is a set of commitments which
foreground rationalism, and individualism as being the core building
blocks of social formations and interactions. The primacy of the
rational individual disavows the role of antagonism in the formation of
identities and believes that the political can be domesticated by the
exercise of rational debate (Mouffe, 2005, pp. 10-11). Liberalism fails
to recognise itself as being political-- that is borne out of conflict
and does not recognise its history that has been compatible with
racialised authoritarianism. Three of the countries who are seen as
representatives of liberalism where racial states (the British Empire,
the French Empire and the United States). As several studies have
demonstrated liberalism belief in the limited role of the state, and the
rights of the individual were compatible with racial-colonial rule
(Sayyid, 2014, pp. 17-29), Western colonial rule was not a contradiction
of liberalism but is validation (Mehta, 1999). The emergence of racism
in its various iterations including Islamophobia in cyberspace does not
belie the logic of liberalism, rather it one of the gateways to the
establishment of racial order in cyberspace. The question is how to
account for the way in which the republic of cyberspace has become
infused with Islamophobia. [Islamophobia circulates not because they are
organisations and individuals who are able to share their hostility
towards Muslims]{.underline} in the physical sphere in Cyberia.
Islamophobia in cyberspace is not a shadow or parallel to the existence
of antagonism towards the Islamicate in the 'real'
world. **[Islamophobia arises
from]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}** **[discursive articulation
of]{.underline}** Cyberia as **[space]{.underline}**. To make good on
this claim I want to draw attention to the work being done on the
republic of letters (e.g. Goodman, 1994; Al-Musawi, 2015). The republic
of letters is a better-suited analogy to the cyberspace than that which
sees the advent of the internet as an enhanced media platform \"The
republic of letters was an intellectual network\" (Goodman, 1994, pp.
14-15) enabled by the technologies of the printing press and postal
system that came to occupy a central position in the constitution of the
public sphere in France from the 17th century onwards.\[10\] The
Enlightenment republic of letters was centred in France, but the network
it generated began to connect European men of letters, academic
institutions, salons and periodicals, beyond the borders of the French
monarchy. These physically dispersed men of letters developed a
consciousness that they constituted a distinct political community that
was cosmopolitan in its orientation. The web that bound the republic of
letters was woven through an "epistolary commerce" (Goodman, 1994, p.
17), which established the standing of its citizens and contribute their
social capital. The republic of letters was bound not by common ideas as
such but rather the circulation of correspondence which forged a sense
of dispersed and fragmented sociability. Many of the participants of in
the Enlightenment republic of letters were involved in theorizing and
advocating colonial-racial domination. The trans-national (or to be more
precise the trans-polity) republic of letters was instrumental in
forging white supremacy as a global enterprise. It allowed for the
possibility of Europeaness when confronted with non-Europeaness to
transcend its internal rivalries and erect a colour line that held firm
until the carnage of First World War (1914-1918) and October revolution
of 1917. Islamophobia has emerged as means of restoring white supremacy
in an increasingly post-Western world order. Cyberspace is one domain
where the post-Western diversity of the planet has yet to penetrate. It
is a space where white privilege is still hegemonic. This hegemony is
arising not merely from the frequency of circulation of Islamophobic
memes but also the structure of cyberspace that is akin to a republic of
letters. **[A new world order has been established around the logic of
the "war on terror".]{.underline}** [Central
to]{.underline} [this]{.underline} [order is
the]{.underline} **[regulation]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[subordination
of]{.underline}** **[expressions
of]{.underline}** **[Muslimness]{.underline}**. The emergence of parts
of cyberspace as Islamophobic republic of letters is due to three main
factors which have changed the international order. Firstly, the end of
the Cold War meant not only the end of the possibility of a
Soviet/communist alternative to Western/capitalist hegemony, but it also
dismantled the very idea of the "Third World". The Third World was not
only a geopolitical category in which it was possible for issues of
concern to the global South to gain leverage by skilful manoeuvring
between US-led camp and Soviet camp. It was also aphilosophical and
cultural base from which to launch an epistemological challenge to the
enduring Eurocentrism. The Third World provided an transnational
infrastructure of resistance and included men and women not only from
the ex-colonies but also, to , some extentfrom the ranks of the
marginalized and dispossessed in the developed world. The convergence of
anti-colonial struggles with anti-racist struggles (pioneered by civil
rights in the U.S)., was crucial. The critique of Orientalism was
enabled by existence of these networks and associations which organized
around the Third World (Sayyid, 2016). This abandonment of a possible
alternative to Western hegemony empowered the belief that the universal
was wrapped in the clothes of Europeaness. The end of the Soviet
alternative however, can be seen philosophically as part of the
de-centring of the West, since even the Soviet Union was a geopolitical
rival at deeper cultural and philosophical level it is considered to be
part of the heritage of the European enlightenment. The apparent victory
in the Cold War only exposed the way in which the world was becoming
post-Western, that is, a world in which colonial-racial order was
eroding. This leads to the second factor is
that **[Western]{.underline}** **[elites]{.underline}** **[have not
emotionally adapted to the post-Western world.]{.underline}** This is
why, so [many of them have rushed to]{.underline} [embrace policies that
seek]{.underline} **[colonial solutions]{.underline}** [to what
are]{.underline} **[postcolonial predicaments]{.underline}**. Thus,
the [antagonism]{.underline} towards Islam and Muslims [is a means of
shoring up the West's sense of its own destiny]{.underline}. The choice
of Islam and Muslim as the antagonistic-other, i.e. as the figure that
subsumes the traumatic kernel that prevents the West from being a fully
realized harmonious and prosperous whole, is not purely
arbitrary. **[The figure of the Muslim]{.underline}** [encompasses all
the attributes of what the West likes to think it is
not]{.underline}: **[misogynist]{.underline}**, **[racist]{.underline}**, **[violent]{.underline}** [etc]{.underline}. [That
is,]{.underline} **[Western
narratives]{.underline}** of **[itself]{.underline}** [are reliant on
articulating the Muslim as the figure which represents the
very]{.underline} **[impossibility of the West]{.underline}** [being
equal]{.underline} [to itself]{.underline}. The incapability of the West
to live up to its own version of what it should be is explained by the
scandal of the Muslim presence-- both geographically and temporally
(Sayyid, 2016). The crisis of social cohesion in the West has become
explicable by reference to the existence of a Muslim presence which
prevents the full closure of these societies around core liberal values.
The failure of liberal values is externalized to the surface of Muslim
bodies rather than something intrinsic to liberalism itself.\[11\] This
externalization cannot cause but bewilderment, grief, and unsettlement
as well as resistance from Muslims. **[At the heart of Islamophobia was
an anxiety about the loss of white privilege]{.underline}**.

2\. Islamophobia and the Clash of Civilizations Thesis The shift
towards [Islamophobia]{.underline} and [using the Muslim subject as
the]{.underline} [singular global
strategic]{.underline} [threat]{.underline} [emerged towards the end of
the Cold War]{.underline} [and the collapse of the Soviet
Union]{.underline}. Even though a case can be made that the 1979 Iranian
Revolution intensified the negative representation of Islam and Muslims
in the West, particularly in the US, nevertheless, the scope of the
demonization was not on the same scale that emerged in the post-Cold War
era. In the UK context, [the appearance of Islamophobia as a concept
into the public policy can be traced to the Iranian
revolution]{.underline} and the Salman Rushdie affair, [which brought an
intense focus on the Muslim community due to the perceived or real
support for the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's fatwa¯ calling for
Rushdie's assassination]{.underline}. Certainly, the political
leadership and the media [discourses]{.underline} at the time we[re
filled with anti-Muslim rhetoric and drawing a distinction between Iran
(representing a feared aspect of Islam) and the Wes]{.underline}t. It is
not surprising that Edward Said's book, [Covering Islam, was written to
explore the media demonization of Islam and Muslims after the 1979
Iranian Revolution]{.underline} (Said 1997). On the other hand, [Said's
Orientalism navigated the long history of representations, scholarly
writing, and stereotyping that often served as a stable source material
for the reproduction of Arab and Muslim otherization]{.underline} (Said
1979). The [anti-Iranian and anti-Shia discourses in the Western and
Arab press were balanced at the time with constructing a favorable view
of the Sunni Afghan Mujhadeen]{.underline}, who had an important
strategic function in confronting and bleeding the Soviet Union in
Afghanistan (Dreyfuss 2005). Thus, [a certain Sunni Jihadi worldview was
incubated in the US and Europe that supported, on the one hand, the war
in Afghanistan and on the other a readiness to oppose and confront the
Iranian revolution, the pretext of defending the eastern gate of the
Arab world from the Iranian Shia expansion]{.underline}. This means that
between 1979 and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Islamophobia was
given a localized and distinct Religions 2018, 9, 282 5 of 13 anti-Shia
aim rather than being an all-encompassing strategy to demonize Islam or
Muslims as a single category. Importantly, the focus shifted on the
"[Dual Containment" in the US foreign policy, a policy fixed on
countering the Arab Nationalism and Islamic fundamentalism, which
included targeting Iran for the Shia revolution and the nationalist
Palestine Liberation Organization, Libya, as well as Iraq until it
joined the Arab and Western strategy to reverse, counter, and bleed the
Iranian Revolution.]{.underline} In this period, the "[Islamic threat"
specifically]{.underline} [meant]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [Iranian
Shia threat]{.underline} [and]{.underline} ["our" allies were the Sunni
Jihadi fundamentalists which encompassed the full spectrum of Sunni
oriented groups and sects]{.underline}. Navigating this strategy
required a careful cultivation of alliances and [constructing a
narrative that would resonate and enable the Sunni majority governments
to mobilize their intelligence agencies to recruit individuals to
participate in the two-front war, the Afghan war against the Russians,
and on the Iraqi front opposing Iran]{.underline}. In both cases, [the
construction of]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [Sunni Jihadi Islam
was]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [needed "religious" tonic to
bring]{.underline} [forth foot]{.underline} [soldiers]{.underline} [into
the battlefields]{.underline} in the thousands and unbeknown to then
assist the US, Europe, and the Arab and Muslim states in implementing
the containment strategy. [The Iran-Iraq war involved a different level
of complexity for US foreign policy and followed a balancing strategy
centering on containment of both parties and preventing a clear victor
from emerging]{.underline}. Arab Nationalism and [Islamic
fundamentalism]{.underline}, which in the
1980s [referred]{.underline} [mainly]{.underline} [to
Iran,]{.underline} [formed US's Dual-Containment policy and
translated]{.underline} [into]{.underline} [supporting the party that
was losing the war and maintaining the balance of power between them
and]{.underline} [cause a drain \[to\]]{.underline} [their
strategic]{.underline} [resources.]{.underline} [Containment is to cause
the diversion of resources]{.underline} [wherever possible away from
being deployed against the US, Israel and any other regional
allies]{.underline}. Thus, Dual-Containment explains the US's readiness
to work with Israel to supply Iran with missiles, a policy was subject
to a congressional hearing and became known as the Iran-Contra Affair.
The watershed moment for the emergence of Islamophobia, an
all-encompassing and undifferentiated in terms of sect and group, is
directly connected to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the immediate
outcome of the 1st Gulf War, and the Palestinian uprising which provided
the stage for problematizing Islam and Muslims as a single threatening
subject. The Islamic groups, sects, and organizations played an
important role during the Cold War by providing a counter and
indigenously framed religious epistemic to counter socialism, communism,
and self-determination oriented nationalism, which has proven to be a
very successful strategy. However, [the end of the Cold War and the
shifts into a unipolar world produced contestation and a race at home
and abroad to define the emerging "new world order" but, more
importantly, a pursuit of opportunities to reshape the US military and
economic priorities in the new era.]{.underline} During this period and
post-Cold
War, [Muslims]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [Islam]{.underline} [become
an otherized]{.underline} [category in the U.S. with multipronged levels
of exclusion]{.underline} [and forms of racialized
discrimination]{.underline} [inflicted upon
individuals]{.underline} [and groups.]{.underline} [The othering
process]{.underline} [directed at
Muslims]{.underline} [was]{.underline} [unleashed]{.underline} by the
political elites that wanted to craft a strategy to contest and maintain
power in the post-Cold
War, [which]{.underline} [included]{.underline} [a
heavy]{.underline} [emphasis on]{.underline} [the
massive]{.underline} [military expenditures]{.underline}, which might
had been cut after the defeat of the Soviet Union[. As the red "evil
empire" came to an end, the machinery for crafting a green menace took
shape in the form of Huntington's "Clash of Civilizations" thesis, which
provided the needed shift and the use of cultural racism as the basis
for differentiation and hostility]{.underline}. Using cultural racism as
the basis for the "Clash of Civilization" thesis is the rebranding of
the pre-WWII des-credited biological racism and is offered as a signpost
for the same sets of racist attitudes and perspectives that were
deployed in the earlier biological version. In this
context, [Islamophobia is]{.underline} [less]{.underline} [about Islam
or even about Muslims themselves]{.underline}, their lives and
hopes [but]{.underline} more [about the unsureness of the Western
societies]{.underline} [as a whole.
The]{.underline} [Cold]{.underline} [War created a common framework
and]{.underline} [presented]{.underline} [the "us" as the
good]{.underline} [side]{.underline} [fighting
collectively]{.underline} [against "them",]{.underline} [the communists
who represented the evil but the question was what to do afterward and
what was the path forward. Targeting Islam and Muslims is the way to
define politics, culture, economy, religion, and identity in the
post-Cold War period. By magnifying the differences and then
transforming them into an existential threat in the mind of the US and
Western public]{.underline}, the forging of a fictitious Religions 2018,
9, 282 6 of 13 sense of patriotic [unity and purpose is possibly
actualized]{.underline}. The U.S. political elites who were suckled on
confronting the "evil empire" emerged less confident and unsure about
the present and future considering all the global political, economic,
and social changes that unfolded rapidly. [The use
of]{.underline} [Islamophobia]{.underline} [and demonization of Islam
and Muslims]{.underline} [serves
the]{.underline} [perfect]{.underline} [diversion for populists
politicians who have no]{.underline} [real]{.underline} [vision for the
future and are able to monetize fear]{.underline} [to slither their way
into seats of power with venomous rhetoric promising restoration and
greatness]{.underline}

which is considered the strategic depth of the Shia expansion (Iraq and

#### The plan plays into the Islamophobic racial capitalist terror-industrial complex

**Rana 16** -- Associate Professor of Asian American Studies at the
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Ph.D. in Social Anthropology
from the University of Texas (Junaid, "The Racial Infrastructure of the
Terror-Industrial Complex", Social Text 129, Vol. 34, No. 4, pp.

December 2016)

The scene Powell portrays situates mainstream American Christianity with
an assumed other of Hinduism, and a notable avoidance of any direct
reference to Islam, with a now familiar exhortation of the
exceptionalism of the United States. And this may be the point: **[one
does not need to mention Islam]{.underline}** [to use the
dog-whistle]{.underline} [terms that imply Muslims in the War on
Terror]{.underline}. That there is a fear of [a few "dangerous" elements
threatening]{.underline} [the]{.underline} ["survival"]{.underline} [of
the entire system]{.underline} betrays a deeper issue at hand. Powell's
description contains [an implicit assumption that Islam is a ubiquitous
category of other that need not be named for it to lurk otherwise in the
thoughts of readers]{.underline}. [This of course is an accepted conceit
of the post-9/11 world, in which the War on Terror has created a media
subtext of]{.underline} [any and all]{.underline} [forms of
terror]{.underline}. Earlier in the interview Powell used the pronoun
they to describe "terrorists" in comparing the "American way of life" as
stronger than threats of death and the destruction of property, again
the presumption that war and violence are already givens in the
landscape of the democratic future of the United States. The dangerous
elements in Brooklyn and New Jersey that Powell referred to are an
evocative object, one that names something without specifics and in a
language that is understood as a proliferation of unending possibility.
Like Eisenhower's famous warning of a military-industrial complex in
1961, Powell raises this issue of a terror-industrial complex somewhat
in passing to tout a sense of American superiority---a "we are better
than this" sort of mentality that situates the democratic political
system as the highest form of collective decision making and prosperity.
For much of the mainstream media at the time, the mention of the
terror-industrial complex failed to make an impact. In large part this
warning from Powell was a side conversation to the lead of the story. In
this same interview Powell issued an apology, admitting that he had made
a mistake in reporting to the United Nations that the US government had
information regarding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. The reference
to the terror-industrial complex stayed buried until 2009, when Keith
Olbermann of MSNBC broadcast a video interview with Colin Powell from
2007. Here campus journalists from the University of Oklahoma newspaper
the Oklahoma Daily had asked him to expand on the idea shortly after he
made his original statement. Powell responded by elaborating his
description of the concept of [the]{.underline} **[terror-industrial
complex]{.underline}** as follows: We're spending an enormous amount of
money on Homeland Security. And I think we should spend whatever it
takes. But I think we have to be careful that we don't get so caught up
in trying [to throw money at the terrorist and counter-terrorist problem
that we essentially are creating an industry that will only exist as
long as you keep the terrorist threat pumped up]{.underline}. . . . We
spend a lot of money to put a lot of equipment out there, kind of
terrorism equipment. But now we need more money to keep that equipment
running. Well, let's make sure that what we have sent out there is
absolutely essential. And let's be cautious in our appropriations and in
spending money. I don't think we're out of control, I think we had to
respond in an aggressive way. But it's now been six years. Let's make
sure we're spending money on the right things, and not spending money
just to spend money.2 This unusual admission of spending on the
"terrorist and counterterrorist problem" is wrapped in the standard
conservative discourse of fiscal restraint and government downsizing.
Powell makes apparent that [the term terror-industrial complex
describes]{.underline} [a relationship with money, or financial capital,
in which]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[threat of terrorism
supersedes]{.underline}** **[actually
existing]{.underline}** [**danger**, in other words, spending money in
the aims of gaining an upper hand in a security situation that requires
an adept military industry]{.underline}. In a similar vein, James Risen
has recently called this formation the Homeland Security--industrial
complex to reference [the proliferation of]{.underline} [companies
seeking military contracts to
provide]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [infrastructure of
the]{.underline} [Global]{.underline} [War on Terrorism]{.underline}.3
In making a distinction from the military-industrial complex, Risen
describes this system thus: "[The new homeland security-complex operates
differently]{.underline}. It is largely made up of [a web of
intelligence agencies and their contractors, companies that mostly
provide secret services rather than large weapons
systems]{.underline} and equipment. These [contractors are hired to help
Washington determine the scale and scope of the terrorist
threat;]{.underline} **[they make no money if they determine that the
threat is overblown]{.underline}** [or, God forbid, if the war on terror
ever comes to an end]{.underline}."4 Risen refers to details shared by
these conceptual approaches through an explicit mandate through
independent contractors while also highlighting [a temporal frame of the
security obsession with terror]{.underline}. [This system that is so
concerned with combating terrorism is indeed premised on a fundamental
shift in military combat that reimagines the terms of war and the notion
of an enemy]{.underline}. Propagating this in terms of a future sense of
permanence and fixity, [there is a financial interest for those who
predict terrorism in such static terms]{.underline}. In other
words, [this is a]{.underline} [system of]{.underline} **[war with no
end]{.underline}**, and [the]{.underline} **[fulfillment
of]{.underline}** **[a system of]{.underline}** **[racial
capitalism]{.underline}** that I describe as racial infrastructure.
Infrastructure in the Marxist usage refers to the means of production
and the category of class, or what might be referred to more generally
as economic and social position. While infrastructure connotes the basic
physical and organizational facilities from which society or a social
system operates, I am here referring to [racial infrastructure as
a]{.underline} **[spatial formation]{.underline}** [in
which]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [social, political, and economic
relationships]{.underline} [of racial systems]{.underline} [operate
through]{.underline} [dominance and discursive power]{.underline}. What
I find instructive in the examples used by Risen and a range of
reportage on [the post-9/11 security state and the War on Terror
is]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[unspoken
racialization]{.underline}** [of terror with Islam and
Muslims]{.underline}.5 Certainly, Risen and others are critical of how
the War on Terror fixates on Islam through an oversimplified syllogism
that equates Muslims with terrorism, yet as I argue in what
follows, [the impact of the terror-industrial complex is far more
extreme than a representational mistake based in the fearmongering of
Islam]{.underline} and Muslims. Rather, [it is
the]{.underline} **[larger]{.underline}** **[systems]{.underline}** [of
structural violence that are normalized]{.underline} [through the
workings of concepts such as race and permanent war that create an
unprecedented flexibility in the workings of social domination and
capital accumulation]{.underline}. As an ideological structure [it is
present in a range of security and biopolitical
technologies]{.underline}, including, for example, [policing, health
care, social services, and the framing of criminality and illegality in
the detention and deportation regime]{.underline}. Whereas the
military-industrial complex conjoined national military and political
forces with the arms industry, the [shift toward the private sector to
conduct military and intelligence operations is part of the transition
into the twenty-first-century development of the terror-industrial
complex]{.underline} and what others such as Risen refer to in terms of
security. Although the concomitant or analogous construction to terror
in this sense is security, a concept that has often been used in
political theory, I prefer to think through these conjoined forces using
the notion of terror. Security is certainly an important ideological
piece of how the terror-industrial complex is deployed, alongside other
representations of state power such as surveillance. However, [terror
also indicates the]{.underline} **[shift from institutions of power to
amorphous
ideas]{.underline}** [so]{.underline} [endemic]{.underline} [in the
rubrics]{.underline} [of the War on Terror]{.underline}.6 [The
terror-industrial complex has dramatically shaped and altered social
life across geographic locations with dramatic differences in
scale]{.underline}. The wide-ranging escalation of structural and
physical violence through war include, for example, the [use of drones
in targeted assassination and surveillance of social life, the everyday
conditions of]{.underline} [military occupation]{.underline} [through
means of war and governance, domestic and foreign mass surveillance,
the]{.underline} [militarization of policing]{.underline} [domestically,
and the use of surveillance and intelligence gathering]{.underline} by
local law enforcement in collaboration or modeled after domestic and
international spying agencies. Recent scholarship has begun to chip away
at these [deep transformations to social life that are guided by the
racialization of Islam and Muslims]{.underline}.7 It is in this sense
that, while the Obama administration no longer uses the specific term
War on Terror to describe what rapidly developed under the Bush years
after 9/11, [the expansion of the security and surveillance state has
brought the enormous apparatus of the terror-industrial complex into
full bloom]{.underline}.

#### Their discourse of terrorism is a meaningless term used to propagate western imperial and neo-colonial regimes.

[In February 2010, a man named Joseph Stack]{.underline} [deliberately
flew his small airplane]{.underline} [into the side of a building that
housed a regional IRS office in Austin, Texas, just as 200 agency
employees were starting their workday.]{.underline} Along with himself,
Stack killed an IRS manager and injured 13 others. Stack was an
anti-tax, anti-government fanatic, and chose his target for exclusively
political reasons. He left behind a lengthy manifesto cogently setting
forth his largely libertarian political views (along with, as I wrote at
the time, some anti-capitalist grievances shared by the left, such as
"rage over bailouts, the suffering of America's poor, and the pilfering
of the middle class by a corrupt economic elite and their
government-servants"; Stack's long note ended: "the communist creed:
From each according to his ability, to each according to his need. The
capitalist creed: From each according to his gullibility, to each
according to his greed"). [About Stack's political grievances, his
manifesto declared that "violence not only is the answer, it is the only
answer." The attack had all of the elements of iconic terrorism, a model
for how it's most commonly understood: down to flying a plane into the
side of a building.]{.underline} **[But Stack was white and non-Muslim.
As a result, not only was the word "terrorism" not applied to Stack, but
it was]{.underline}** **[explicitly declared
inapplicable]{.underline}** **[by media outlets and government officials
alike.]{.underline}** The New York Times's report on the incident stated
that while the attack "initially inspired fears of a terrorist attack"
--- before the identity of the pilot was known --- now "in place of the
typical portrait of a terrorist driven by ideology, Mr. Stack was
described as generally easygoing, a talented amateur musician with
marital troubles and a maddening grudge against the tax authorities." As
a result, said the Paper of Record, "officials ruled out any connection
to terrorist groups or causes." And "federal officials emphasized the
same message, describing the case as a criminal inquiry." [Even
when]{.underline} [U.S. Muslim groups called]{.underline} [for the
incident to be declared "terrorism," the FBI continued to insist it "was
handling the case 'as a criminal matter of an assault on a federal
officer' and that it was not being considered as an act of
terror."]{.underline} By very stark contrast, consider the October 2014,
shooting in Ottawa by a single individual, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, at the
Canadian Parliament building. As soon as it was known that the shooter
was a convert to Islam, the incident was instantly and universally
declared to be "terrorism." Less than 24 hours afterward, Prime Minister
Stephen Harper declared it a terror attack and even demanded new
"counter-terrorism" powers in its name (which he has now obtained). To
bolster the label, the government claimed Zehaf-Bibeau was on his way to
Syria to fight with jihadists, and the media trumpeted this "fact." In
his address to the nation the day after the shooting, Harper vowed to
learn more about the "terrorist and any accomplices he may have had" and
intoned: "This is a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types
of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world." Twitter
users around the world en masse used the hashtag of solidarity reserved
(for some reason) only for cities attacked by a Muslim (but not cities
attacked by their own governments): #OttawaStrong. In sum, that this was
a "terror attack" was mandated conventional wisdom before anything was
known other than the Muslim identity of the perpetrator. As it turns
out, other than the fact that the perpetrator was Muslim and was aiming
his violence at Westerners, almost nothing about this attack had the
classic hallmarks of "terrorism." In the days and weeks that followed,
it became clear that Zehaf-Bibeau suffered from serious mental illness
and "seemed to have become mentally unstable." He had a history of
arrests for petty offenses and had received psychiatric treatment. His
friends recall him expressing no real political views but instead
claiming he was possessed by the devil. The Canadian government was
ultimately forced to admit that their prior media claim about him
preparing to go to Syria was totally false, dismissing it as "a
mistake." Now that Canadians know the truth about him --- rather than
the mere fact that he's Muslim and committed violence --- a plurality no
longer believe the "terrorist" label applies, but believe the attack was
motivated by mental illness. [The term "terrorist"
got]{.underline} [instantly]{.underline} [applied by know-nothings for
one reason:]{.underline} [he was Muslim and had committed violence, and
that,]{.underline} [in the post-9/11 West, is more or less the only
working definition of the term (in the rare cases when it is applied to
non-Muslims these days, it's typically]{.underline} [applied to
minorities]{.underline} [engaged in acts that have no resemblance to
what people usually think of when they hear the term).]{.underline} That
is the crucial backdrop for yesterday's debate over whether the term
"terrorism" applies to the heinous shooting by a white nationalist of
nine African-Americans praying in a predominantly black church in
Charleston, South Carolina. Almost immediately, news reports indicated
there was "no sign of terrorism" --- by which they meant: it does not
appear that the shooter is Muslim. Yet other than the perpetrator's
non-Muslim identity, the Charleston attack from the start had the
indicia of what is commonly understood to be "terrorism." Specifically,
the suspected shooter was clearly a vehement racist who told witnesses
at the church that he was acting out of racial hatred and a desire to
force African-Americans "to go." His violence was the byproduct of and
was intended to publicize and forward his warped political agenda, and
was clearly designed to terrorize the community he hates. That's
why **[so many]{.underline}** **[African-American and Muslim
commentators and
activists]{.underline}** **[insisted]{.underline}** **[that the term
"terrorist" be applied: because it looked, felt and smelled exactly like
other acts that are instantly branded "terrorism" when the perpetrator
is Muslim and the victims largely white.]{.underline}** [It was very
hard --- and still is --- to escape the conclusion that the term
"terrorism," at least as it's predominantly used in the post-9/11 West,
is about the identity of those committing the violence and the identity
of the targets.]{.underline} **[It manifestly has nothing to do with
some neutral, objective assessment of the acts being
labelled.]{.underline}** The point here is not, as some very confused
commentators suggested, to seek an expansion of the term "terrorism"
beyond its current application. As someone who has spent the last decade
more or less exclusively devoted to documenting the abuses and
manipulations that term enables, the last thing I want is an expansion
of its application. But what I also don't want is for non-Muslims to
rest in their privileged nest, satisfied that the term and its
accompanying abuses is only for that marginalized group. And [what I
especially don't want is to have this glaring, damaging mythology
persist that the term "terrorism" is some sort of objectively
discernible, consistently applied designation of a particularly hideous
kind of violence.]{.underline} **[I'm eager to have the term recognized
for what it is:]{.underline}** **[a]{.underline}** **[completely
malleable, manipulated, vapid]{.underline}** **[term of
propaganda]{.underline}** **[that has no consistent application
whatsoever.]{.underline}** [Recognition of that reality is vital to
draining the term of its potency.]{.underline} **[The examples proving
the utter malleability of the term "terrorism" are far too numerous to
chronicle here. But over the past decade alone,]{.underline}** **[it's
been used by Western political and media figures to condemn
Muslims]{.underline}** **[who used]{.underline}** **[violence against an
invading and occupying]{.underline}** **[force in Afghanistan, against
others who]{.underline}** **[raised funds to help
Iraqis]{.underline}** **[fight against an invading and occupying
military in their country, and for others who
attack]{.underline}** **[soldiers in an army that is fighting many
wars.]{.underline}** [In other words,]{.underline} [any violence by
Muslims against the West
is]{.underline} [inherently]{.underline} ["terrorism,"]{.underline} [even
if targeted only at soldiers at war and/or designed to resist invasion
and occupation.]{.underline} [By stark contrast, no violence by the West
against Muslims can]{.underline} [possibly]{.underline} [be
"terrorism,"]{.underline} [n]{.underline}

### Islamophobia Impact

#### The attempt to eradicate Islam is inherently discriminatory against Muslims -- it creates a self fulfilling prophecy recreating the extremist threat

Ever since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, in which Islamic violent
extremists killedthousands of Americans and caused billions of dollars
in damage on US soil, [American political and popular discourse has
treated radical Islam, Islamic terrorism, and Islamic violent extremism
as ever-present threats to **Western safety** and ways of
life]{.underline}. These violent ideologies and activities have, indeed,
caused enormous bloodshed and destruction, affecting millions of
civilians in the USA and abroad. However, [the West's fear of violent
extremism, and [the]{.mark} [groundless]{.mark} of [conflation]{.mark}
of this violence [with]{.mark} the religion of [Islam]{.mark} itself,
have also [morph]{.mark}ed [into]{.mark} a troubling new crisis: a rise
in **[Islamophobia]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Defined as fear and suspicion
of those who are or are perceived to be Muslim or belonging to the
Islamic faith[, Islamophobia is based on a **false** equivalency of
violent extremism with Islamic religion and culture as a whole. In
recent years, Islamophobia has [created]{.mark} an [environment]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} ambient [hostility]{.mark} [toward]{.mark} the law-abiding
majority of Muslim American, [Muslims]{.mark} in the West, and in
Afghanistan [who would]{.mark} otherwise **[be key allies]{.mark} in the
fight [against]{.mark} violent [extremism]{.mark}**.]{.underline} From
anti-Islamic rhetoric, to racial profiling, to Koran burnings, the
litany of Islamophobic narratives, policies, and events of the past
twenty years have been undermining the US initiatives for countering
violent extremist (CVE) and its efforts at counterterrorism &
counterinsurgency efforts both domestically and

abroad. For the two decades since 9/11, the USA has been waging a Global
War on Terror to counter violent extremism worldwide. Over time, the war
has mushroomed into a conflict of a unique nature and unprecedented
scale, wherein US policymakers and military leaders have attempted to
defeat violent extremism by gaining the support of the local people most
affected by it, a strategy known as "winning hearts and minds" (WHAM).
According to this soft power strategy, the best way to conduct
counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations is to cultivate
support among the local communities. This is done by showcasing that the
USA and its allies have the community's best interests at heart so that
those same communities will contribute to the effort. The WHAM strategy
depends upon the development and maintenance of harmonious
cross-cultural relationships between the USA and its Muslim allies. It
is also the most promising route to achieving a stable peace in
Afghanistan. However, Islamophobia among Americans and their allies has
eroded relationships with local Muslim communities in Afghanistan, as
well as with many of the 1.8 billion Muslims worldwide. Whether
intentional or not[, incidents and [policies]{.mark} perceived as
Islamophobic, when **[perpetrated by Western governments]{.mark}**,
media, and civilians, [alienate]{.mark} [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
sometimes [**[radicalize]{.mark}**]{.underline} crucial [[Muslim]{.mark}
allie[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Islamophobic incidents have [led]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [discrimination]{.mark}, [harassment]{.mark},]{.underline}
and even [threats and physical attacks against Muslims,]{.underline}
thereby [[stigmatizing]{.mark} and endangering millions of peaceful,
law-abiding Muslim Americans and [Muslims]{.mark}
[worldwide]{.mark}]{.underline}. Over the past two decades, Islamophobia
has continued to spread, despite ample statistics and studies supporting
the view that [[Muslims **are as good and as law-abiding**]{.mark} of
citizens as anyone else]{.underline}. Islamophobia directly undermines
the effort of the USA and its allies to win hearts and minds and
stabilize Afghanistan. Islamophobia has exacerbated the war by spreading
false and divisive narratives that compromise efforts by policymakers
and practitioners. Through the spread of these poisonous narratives and
the events they set in motion, Islamophobia poses a direct threat to the
success of CVE strategies and efforts in the War on Terror. [Violent
[extremist groups]{.mark}]{.underline} in Afghanistan [[leverage]{.mark}
evidence of [Islamophobia]{.mark} to frighten]{.underline} Afghan
[villagers [into compliance, portraying **US and NATO**]{.mark} forces
[as blasphemous, anti-Muslim invaders]{.mark} who threaten]{.underline}
the Afghan people's [religion and their very way of life.]{.underline}
In the West, similar perceptions weaken domestic programs aimed at
countering violent extremism, as these programs rely on cooperation with
local Muslim communities[. The spread of
**[Islamophobia]{.mark}**]{.underline} since 9/11 [has]{.underline} not
only hindered US efforts in the Global War on Terror; it has also
[**[created]{.mark} direct [harm]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [the]{.mark} large
[part]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [global population who are]{.mark} or are
perceived to be [Muslim]{.mark}**. From mistreatment to outright
attacks, the [effects of Islamophobia exacerbate a broader sense of
**Muslim alienation**]{.mark} from the rest of society]{.underline}.
Recent polls indicate that large numbers of Muslim Americans are
subjected to discrimination, suspicion, and even physical threats and
attacks based on their religion. Many [Muslims have come to feel as if
they are outcasts, expressing stress and wariness about their
livelihood]{.underline} and well-being within the USA. The sense of
[constant suspicion erodes relationships between the Muslim community
and the]{.underline} non-Muslim [[USA]{.mark} and, ironically,
[provides]{.mark} a [motive]{.mark} [for]{.mark} **friendly [Muslims to
be]{.mark}come [radicalized]{.mark}.** Muslims' **[devotion to]{.mark}
defending their [faith is]{.mark} then [exploited]{.mark}** by violent
extremists [within terrorist organizations]{.mark}, who
recruit]{.underline}

[previously friendly Muslims into their cause. In this way,
[Islamophobia]{.mark} fuels these extremists' cause by
[amplifying]{.mark} ordinary **Muslims' [sense of being under
threat]{.mark} and [driving]{.mark} them [into]{.mark} [the]{.mark} fold
of the violent [extremists]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### ALT -- Rethink Approach to Islam

#### The Alternative is to reject the Aff and rethink our approach to Islamic taqwa -- Only a shift away from NATO's inherent Islamophobic rhetoric can restructure the extremist threat It solves for the affs desire of security

This book argues **[that [we ought to take]{.mark} all forms of
[Islamophobia]{.mark} [seriously]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Too often,

[Americans respond to the fear of an impending terror attack by turning
on our own. But]{.underline}

[if the United States continues to leave 3.5 million Americans
vulnerable to hate and]{.underline}

[prejudice, [national security can never be]{.mark} fully
[established]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the core narrative of

counterinsurgency and counterterrorism, and counterradicalization will
be undermined.

[[Islamophobia]{.mark} directly and indirectly [hinders]{.mark} the
[efforts]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the United States and its]{.underline}

[allies to develop strong ties with the [l]{.mark}ocal and global
[Muslim]{.mark} population that are critical]{.underline}

[to achieving durable [peace]{.mark}]{.underline} in Afghanistan and
advancing the U.S.'s position in the

Great Powers Competition. The goal of violent extremists is not only to
combat the U.

S. and NATO militarily, but also to undermine the perception of cohesion
within

Western society. By creating an "us-versus-them" mentality between
Westerners and

Muslims, they hope to lure people into their cause for retribution.
[Therefore, the]{.underline}

[[approach to combatting]{.mark} violent [extremists]{.mark}
[should]{.mark} also involve [undermining]{.mark} their]{.underline}

[[narrative and win]{.mark}ning the [support]{.mark} [of]{.mark} local
communities. Fostering [cooperation]{.mark} and]{.underline}

[supplying the communities with necessities can help prevent additional
violent]{.underline}

[extremist groups from arising and recruiting new members.]{.underline}
Given that the U.S. and

NATO forces have unintentionally offended local communities, it would be
in the best

interest of coalition forces to recruit members of the communities and
those who are

knowledgeable of the values of the local and neighboring communities.
Creating social

integration domestically will also be paramount to our efforts in
Islamic nations.

Because [the [narrative of inclusivity]{.mark} is the only narrative
that [can]{.mark} [defeat]{.mark} the narrative]{.underline}

[of [alienation and separation]{.mark} that is [promoted]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} violent [extremists]{.mark}, there can be no]{.underline}

[room for any form of discrimination from the West]{.underline} or
coalition forces. Any [tinge of]{.underline}

[[Islamophobia]{.underline}]{.mark}, whether direct or perceived, [puts
the narrative of inclusivity at risk]{.underline} and

undermines the victims of 9/11, the efforts and treasury put into the
war, and the blood

and sacrifices of each soldier who has fought to uphold freedom and
democracy. When

negativity is broadcast, whether via national leadership, mass media
coverage, social

media, or Hollywood, and whether by private individuals or
organizations, it [[fuels]{.mark} [the]{.mark}]{.underline}

[narratives of violent extremists, who exploit them to their advantage
and [claim that]{.mark}]{.underline}

[these actions are America's and the West's true
intentions]{.underline}. The [propagandists]{.underline} strategically
attempt to create the discord and division using various media as a
megaphone

to [amplify the message that [the U.S. and the West are out to destroy
Islam and its way]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[of life]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Respecting]{.underline} American
[Muslims and [protecting]{.mark} their civil
[rights]{.mark}]{.underline} is not only the right

thing to do; it is also in line with our espoused American values [and
[demonstrates]{.mark} to the]{.underline}

[world that we live up to our values of respecting [religious
freedom]{.mark} and embracing all]{.underline}

[law-abiding people. Embracing law-abiding Muslims [refutes the claims
of extremist]{.mark}]{.underline}

[propaganda]{.underline}. In a sense, the aggregate [violent extremists'
movements might be considered a form of global insurgency [that can only
be countered through positive relationships between the U.S.]{.mark}
Government [and Muslim communities]{.mark}]{.underline}, both
domestically and internationally. Insurgents work by attempting to
delegitimize the opposing government, and the easiest way to destroy the
credibility of the U.S. government is to create the perception of
hypocrisy (Headquarters Department of the Army 2006). If we fail to
support and enforce the civil rights of American Muslims simply because
of ethnic or religious differences, then we are seen as hypocrites who
cannot be trusted.

Perhaps we should instead take a hard and practical look at [what
bureaucracy, money, [military]{.mark}, and programs [can]{.mark} [never
accomplish]{.mark}: [inclusiveness]{.mark}, relationship-building,
partnership, knowledge-sharing, appreciation, creativity, collaboration,
[dignity]{.mark}, [respect]{.mark}, empathy, [and
equality]{.mark}]{.underline}. Effective relationships are made possible
through understanding, respect, and mutual trust.
