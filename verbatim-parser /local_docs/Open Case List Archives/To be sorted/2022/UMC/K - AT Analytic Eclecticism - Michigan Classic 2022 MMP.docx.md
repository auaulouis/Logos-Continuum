### Perm Fails -- Reinforces Dominant Theories of IR

#### The perm fails -- it is not an authentic attempt at analytic eclecticism. The attempt to tack our alternative onto the plan reinforces dominant discourses in IR

[[If analytic eclecticism is to]{.underline}]{.mark} successfully
[[engage post-positivist research, it must]{.underline}]{.mark} continue
to [[engage in debates over "reflexivity]{.underline},"]{.mark} debates
which have been mostly confined to the field's dissident periphery. [But
to do so, [it will have to]{.mark} more fully [engage the "double
hermeneutic]{.mark}]{.underline}," which denotes the
"slippage"---between the meaningful frames of lay actors on the one hand
and the metalanguages of social scientists on the other---that a
researcher will encounter while practising social science.47 [[Meaning
is imposed]{.mark} doubly, [by the objects of
research]{.mark}]{.underline} upon the relevant events situated in their
own context [[and by the researchers]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is
challenging to forms of triad scholarship modelled on natural sciences,
which, being concerned with unreflective physical objects and a world
that "does not answer back," need neither take into account the
self-interpretations of the people being studied nor weigh the
researchers' self-interpretations, as do the social sciences.
[Eclecticism will]{.underline} also [have to navigate]{.underline}
myriad conceptions of "[reflexivity]{.underline}" and, as Michael Lynch
suggests, there is "a confusing array of reflexivities" but "no single
way to be, or not to be, reflexive."48 In IR, reflexivity has been
deployed to signal the self-conscious situating of a researcher in their
research, attending to the premises of one's process of theorizing and
researching (including one's cultural-political prejudices), the
submission of favoured theories to contextualization and historical
reflection, and recognition of how analytic and data-gathering choices
condition the data produced, among other definitions.49 Though variously
conceived, reflexivity is a key value commitment of non-triad research
traditions in IR. Constructivists Audie Klotz and Cecelia Lynch urge
that scholars recognize the inevitability of "bias," yet "strive to be
self-aware, in order to understand the moral and methodological
implications of our choices."50 Patrick Thaddeus Jackson argues that
[the recognition that]{.underline} [methodology is "complicit in the
production and reproduction of the world]{.underline}" [commits the
scholar]{.underline} who wants to research this world [to]{.underline}
reflexivity, "[an awareness of how the habits and experiences that one
is bringing to bear on a situation shape and construct that
situation.]{.underline}"51 [Feminist IR theory offers perhaps the most
sustained reflection on reflexivity and IR research]{.underline}. For
example, Ackerly, Stern, and True place reflexivity, which they define
as the continual re-interrogation of one's own scholarship, at the core
of the feminist approach to methodology.52 Following the work of Sandra
Harding and others, Ann Tickner describes feminist reflexivity as a
posture that recasts the relationship between researcher and subject,
attends to related power disparities, and resists the assumption of
scholarly detachment.53 Thus, [[eclecticists]{.underline}
[must]{.underline}]{.mark} be willing not only to countenance a broad
rejection of the belief in any transcendent, universally valid
knowledge,54 but also to [[open their own scholarly practices up to
scrutiny and consider their own normative
influences]{.underline}.]{.mark} As Cai Wilkinson observes, [[since
reflexivity cannot "**be retrospectively bolted on to our
research**]{.underline}" [analytic eclectics can start from an "explicit
articulation of how the research was actually done, why and with what
effects for the resulting interpretation that is
presented]{.underline}]{.mark}."55 Reflexivity may prompt a variety of
reappraisals regarding the ways scholars are bound up in the production
of knowledge about climate change. Directed at institutions, reflexive
attitudes may inspire us to inquire into the funding sources of the
modern university system, colonized as it is by corporate sponsorship of
academic institutions and foundations funded by energy extractive
industries with a pronounced "interest in staving off any government
action on climate change and weakening environmental safeguards."56
Individual-level approaches to scholarly reflexivity are diverse and
defy summary, but Heather A. Smith's work is illustrative. Writing in a
post-positivist feminist vein, Smith presents Indigenous voices and ways
of knowing, which, she argues, disrupt the "global" discourse of climate
change in a way so as not to colonize or exoticize their discourse while
at the same time flagging the contested and political nature of the term
"Indigenous." Smith further emphasizes how [[un-reflexive scholarly
practices can reinforce dominant discourses]{.underline},]{.mark} seen
for example in discussions of climate inequality that ignore Indigenous
peoples from the global North.57

### Perm Fails -- Pragmatism Bad

#### The pragmatic nature of the permutation renders power relations invisible which reinforces the dominant norms of IR

Global Policy Analysis, "Eclecticism or exclusivity? The (critical)
pragmatist ethos of (intersectional) analytic eclecticism," 75(3):

Analytic eclecticism holds significant promise for IR. However,
[as]{.underline} it is [currently]{.underline} [conceptualized,
[analytic eclecticism falls short of resulting in eclectic
research]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Instead, [it has the opposite effect,
reinforcing the hold of mainstream paradigms on the
field]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why does analytic eclecticism fall short of
its emancipatory promise? In this article, I trace this contradictory
effect to the pragmatist ethos underlying analytic eclecticism.
[[The]{.mark} internal [contradiction begins with]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[pragmatist tenets]{.underline}]{.mark} Sil and Katzenstein lay
out. [[These tenets]{.mark} [rely on a]{.mark} [popular---but
uncritical]{.mark}---[understanding of pragmatism]{.mark}, one [that
fails to account for power]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}15 [[This
foundation is especially problematic as it makes invisible the
disciplinary power dynamics which reify and are reified in the
privileging of the dominant theoretical triad in]{.underline}
[IR]{.underline}.]{.mark}16 Given this contradictory outcome, can
analytic eclecticism's promise of liberating scholarship from
paradigmatic boundaries still be achieved? Perhaps, but not without a
critical ethos.

### Perm Fails - Ethics DA / Policing DA

#### Their permutation can't capture the ethical orientation of the alternative -- their method's insistence on "policy relevance" is an act of disciplinary policing

Eric **Blanchard**, **2020**, International Journal: Canada's Journal of
Global Policy Analysis, "Combing the same beach: analytic eclecticism
and the challenge of theoretical multilingualism ," 75(3): 404-419, mm

Christian Reus-Smit has argued that [[Sil and
Katzenstein's]{.underline}]{.mark} epistemologically
"empirical-theoretic [[project]{.underline}" [is]{.underline}
]{.mark}[not equipped to deal with normative reflection and thus
[unable]{.mark} [to]{.mark} produce the kind of practical knowledge that
can "[animate social and political action]{.mark}."]{.underline}71
[This]{.underline} lack of "systematic reflection on values,"72
according to Reus-Smit, [hobbles]{.underline} [analytic eclecticism's
efforts to produce policy-relevant knowledge]{.underline} as it intends,
in the spirit of Aristotelian phronesis. Relatedly, [an avowed concern
with ethics is never far from the top of the intellectual priority list
of many non-triad scholars]{.underline}. For instance, [feminist IR
approaches to research methods place ethics among epistemology,
ontology, and choice of method as primary elements of a definition of
methodology]{.underline}.73 Constructivists Klotz and Lynch recognize
what they see as the unavoidable ethical dimension of constructivist
scholarship, though they warn "against translating ethical assumptions
into particular tools of analysis" and against granting any particular
method the "moral high ground."74 Ethical motivations are certainly not
the monopoly of [[critical scholars]{.underline}]{.mark}, but this
community [[tends to foreground ethical concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} in
its publications [more prominently than realist, liberal, and
causal-oriented constructivists.]{.underline} [[Sil and Katzenstein's
discussion of ethics]{.underline}]{.mark} (in their review of the work
of Hoffmann and Finnemore) [[is scattered]{.underline}]{.mark}, lacks
focus, and could be enriched through dialogue with non-triad
approaches.75 [This is not to say it will be easy to surface ethics in
the eclectic analytic heuristic]{.underline}. The urgency of climate
change clearly raises enormous ethical issues: intergenerational
responsibilities, the morality of population growth, the commitment to
exuberant consumption and carbon-intensive transportation practices, and
obligations to (distant) humans and non-human life, to name a few.
Generally, the commitments of the dominant paradigms of IR, with their
group-centric power politics and free-trade-centred pursuit of progress,
sit uneasily with the range of anthropocentric and ecocentric approaches
to environmental ethics. Burke et al. suggest we develop an ethics of
climate change, one worthy of the unprecedented challenge, one that goes
beyond "visions of the good life" to address "the goodness of life
itself."76 At a more modest scale, ethical approaches to climate change
scholarship align with reflexive postures that acknowledge and
foreground researcher positionality and entail giving respectful voice
to marginalized peoples and impacted positions. [[Given the demand for
ethics]{.mark}]{.underline} in a chaotic present and uncertain future,
[[non-triad approaches are arguably better placed to
cultivate]{.mark}]{.underline} the necessary [[ethical
imagination]{.underline}]{.mark} or identify the constitution of nascent
planetary identities, but they certainly complicate the picture we have
of climate change beyond states and markets, geopolitics, and public
goods, making the boundaries of policy relevancy particularly salient.
[[Critical and post-positivist scholars might naturally be suspicious of
the eclectic project]{.underline},]{.mark} directed at climate change or
as a general program, [[if it seems to reify existing power-laden
disciplinary structures **by policing the borders of legitimate
scholarship**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This]{.mark} particular emphasis
on power [relates to a]{.mark} possible post-positivist [concern with
the eclectic impulse toward policy relevance]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Recall Sil and Katzenstein's argument that the value-added of
eclecticism involves relating research to ordinary actors and
policy-makers. [Sil and Katzenstein suspect the "compartmentalization of
knowledge" prohibits the beneficial sharing of insights that address
real-world dilemmas]{.underline}. [Yet [a move toward policy relevance
as a criterion for research may strike many]{.mark} who self-identify
outside of the mainstream [as]{.mark} political and even
[disciplining]{.mark}]{.underline}. Steve Smith argues that [[when "one
party announces that approaches have to be policy relevant, \[it is\]
usually defined as relevant for activities of the state]{.underline}.
[Dismissing work as being irrelevant to policy choices is a powerful
disciplining device]{.underline}]{.mark}."77 This issue evokes further
discussion of the ethics of useful knowledge, of its "relevance" (to the
state? to ordinary or marginal people? to whom?) and intelligibility.
From Sil and Katzenstein's text, it seems eclecticism emphasizes an
appeal to policy-makers more than "ordinary actors," but this need not
be the case. Feminist IR scholars, for example, can argue that their
theories and scholarship, developed in close consultation and
interaction with real-world activists, policy-makers, and ordinary
women, does not "sit on the sidelines" and suffers no such relevance
deficit (witness titanic efforts to theorize "gender mainstreaming" in
global governance, attention to rape in warfare and other forms of
sexual violence, and projects to enable women by making them
"productive" in the global economy).

### Perm Fails -- Exclusion DA

#### Exclusion DA -- Consensus is not always possible - forcing the alternative to coexist with the plan fosters inclusionary violence and inevitably excludes the voices of the oppressed

Jessica **Peet, 2020,** International Journal: Canada's Journal of
Global Policy Analysis, "Eclecticism or exclusivity? The (critical)
pragmatist ethos of (intersectional) analytic eclecticism," 75(3):
420-432, mm

At first glance, pragmatism seems to provide an appropriate foundation
for analytic eclecticism. Pragmatism's investment in consensus combined
with its recognition that knowledge is discursive and social---and thus
open to reformulation---provides an alternative perspective to IR's
tendencies to understand knowledge as either the product of objective
rationalism or subjective interpretivism. Where specific theoretical
paradigms choose one approach or the other, pragmatism advocates the
utility of both derivations. Thus, in theory, a pragmatist ethos allows
eclectic research to sidestep metatheoretical debates and the challenges
inherent in combining opposing perspectives.18 In practice, [by not
acknowledging the power dynamics which shape these controversies in
disciplinary IR]{.underline},19 [[a pragmatist ethos can have the effect
of (re)producing the status quo]{.underline},]{.mark} privileging
rationalism, positivism, and the dominant theoretical triad. [This
inattention to power]{.underline}, [generally, and the disciplinary
power dynamics of epistemological difference, specifically, can be
linked to pragmatism's investment in universalism]{.underline}.
Universalism, or the belief in a common category or position salient
across theoretical traditions, enables multiple perspectives to be
combined without fear of incommensurability, an issue that Fred Chernoff
addresses in more detail in his contribution to this forum.20 Yet, [by
assuming that a universal category exists, [pragmatism]{.mark} actually
[simplifies complex issues]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [this focus
on a universal category privileges that category as most important,
marginalizing the relevance of other categories along with their
potential explanatory power.]{.underline} [This marginalization directly
counters analytic eclecticism's goal of attending to complexity and
bringing diverse approaches to the forefront]{.underline}. [This
investment in universalism also brings about a static view of
categories]{.underline}. Universal categories are identified by their
similarities, which are fixed and unchanging across time and theoretical
tradition. Sil and Katzenstein identify the substantive referent (i.e.,
the research problem) to be the universal category, arguing that the
research problem is not dependent on the theoretical approach(es) being
employed. However, to identify a common category among different
approaches, it must be determined a priori what similarities are to be
contained within that category. Thus, [for any determination to be made,
artificial boundaries must be imposed upon the referent so that it can
be identified]{.underline}. [But imposing constructed boundaries upon
the referent works to simplify the problem, which again contravenes the
goals of analytic eclecticism]{.underline}. [[Pragmatism]{.mark} also
provides a questionable foundation for analytic eclecticism because it
[tends to privilege consensus over difference]{.mark}]{.underline}.21
[[Achieving consensus renders dynamic and complex interactions among and
within categories invisible]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This]{.mark} both
[undermines the spirit of eclecticism]{.mark} and ignores the wider
power dynamics that shape the field]{.underline}. **[[Consensus is not
always possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Sometimes commonality cannot
be found because no universal category or position exists, and forcing
commonality **can breed violences of inclusion**]{.underline}]{.mark}.22
Gayatri Spivak famously argues that [[the subaltern is rendered
mute]{.underline}]{.mark} (and therefore can neither speak nor be heard)
[[because of the complexities of finding consensus between the position
of the subaltern and that of the oppressor]{.underline}]{.mark}.23
Achille Mbembe argues that [t[he illusion of consensus across wide power
differentials is only possible in conditions of extreme violence
perpetrated on those at the lower end of those
differentials]{.mark}]{.underline}.24 Taken together, these problems
show how [[eclectic theorizing functions to
exclude]{.underline}]{.mark}. Investment in consensus and universality
inhibits the visibility of (disciplinary) power dynamics, even though
they are central to shaping what is considered universal and who is
considered part of any consensus produced by analytic eclecticism. When
conceptualized with this kind of ethos, [[analytic eclecticism will
always have exclusive effects because it lacks the tools to recognize or
correct its own exclusivity]{.underline}]{.mark}. To achieve
inclusivity, these foundations must be challenged.

### Perm Fails -- Footnoting DA

#### Footnoting DA -- the perm fails since it only emphasizes dominant IR, rendering the alt ineffective

Eric **Blanchard, 2020,** International Journal: Canada's Journal of
Global Policy Analysis, "Combing the same beach: analytic eclecticism
and the challenge of theoretical multilingualism ," 75(3): 404-419, mm

[The promise of [eclecticism]{.mark}]{.underline} as a facilitator of
scholarly communication, however, [[is limited]{.mark} [by]{.mark} Sil
and Katzenstein's decision to limit [its scope to realism, liberalism,
and constructivism without giving]{.mark} sustained
[consideration]{.mark} [to the wide range of potentially eclectic
approaches to world politics]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The authors
justify limiting the purview of their pluralist project to the triad by
arguing these represent the "most prevalent approaches in the United
States and worldwide."35 However, as Cornut has noted, [[this choice
opens Sil and Katzenstein to charges "of using]{.underline}]{.mark}
problem-driven [[pragmatism to appear more pluralist **while creating
strict disciplinarian boundaries that render challenges to the
mainstream illegitimate**]{.underline}]{.mark}."36 Since a partial
pluralism is ultimately self-defeating, it makes sense to promote Sil
and Katzenstein's stated efforts to produce a "greater scope for
deliberation among a more inclusive community of inquirers"37 by
involving as many outsiders as possible who roughly fit the three main
commitments (noted above). [[Limiting the relevant paradigms]{.mark} to
those currently dominant also [misses an opportunity to interact with a
set of interlocutors ignored in the original formulation of
eclecticism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ten years after the publication of
Beyond Paradigms, eclecticism has the opportunity to live up to its
communicative promise by engaging the products of a maturing
methodological turn in critical approaches to IR and Political Science.
There are a number of excellent works addressing research design,
argument, and metatheory in IR and Political Science that include
consideration of non-triad approaches within the framework of philosophy
of social science.38 In addition, [[there exists]{.underline}]{.mark} a
first generation of [[high-quality]{.underline}]{.mark} methodological
primers on what it means to engage in the practice of [[critical
research produced by authors working under the banners of
interpretivism, constructivism, feminism, post-structuralism, and
political theory]{.underline}]{.mark}.39 This literature is remarkable
in that it emanates from traditions that had long resisted the
imperatives of systematization, methodologism, and scientism,
recognizing the negative effects that adherence to standardized cannons
or procedures can have on scholarship.40
