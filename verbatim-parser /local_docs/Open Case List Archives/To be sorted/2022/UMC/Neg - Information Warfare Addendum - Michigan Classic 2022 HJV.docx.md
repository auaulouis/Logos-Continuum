[Annina **Claesson**, April **8**, **2019**, \"]{.mark}Coming Together
to Fight Fake News: Lessons from the European Approach to
Disinformation,\" CSIS,
https[://www.csis.org/coming-together-fight-fake-news-lessons-european-approach-disinformation]{.mark}

[For observers across the pond, [Europe has been a testing ground for
tactics to counter disinformation in democracies**.** Over the course of
many national elections in the past few years,]{.underline}]{.mark}
[Europe [has]{.mark} tried a [variety of measures to counter
disinformation efforts from multiple sources**.** Now, the European
Union is aiming to complement national efforts by scaling up its own
response through EU-level policies**.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[In an effort to address what some civil society and media
organizations have criticized as an overly disaggregated approach by the
European Union, c]{.mark}urrent EU efforts focus on proper coordination
with and among the many actors involved in countering
disinformation.]{.underline} Specifical[ly, [the EU response is focused
on three lines of effort**:** improving interagency and international
cooperation**; stepping up ambitions in addressing the role of the
private sector;** and instituting a plan to support media literacy**.**
In addition to helping the European Union tackle disinformation
campaigns that seek to disrupt the democratic process, these measures
can also serve as a template for the United States and other countries
as they design their own anti-disinformation
strategies.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Strengthening Interagency and International
Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The problem of disinformation is a complex and disaggregated
one]{.underline}. While [the **United States often sees disinformation
narrowly as the dissemination of "fake news" by Russian trolls**, the
"European approach" often takes a wider view]{.underline}.1 its recent
communications, [the European Union presents disinformation as a problem
rooted in complex and rapid socioeconomic changes.]{.underline} [Our
democracies are now characterized by stark societal divisions that
malign actors may seek to exploit]{.underline}. [While this is nothing
new]{.underline}, [technological developments have made disinformation a
powerful, inexpensive, and often profitable method of influencing a
range of actors from powerful states to small extremist groups.
State-sponsored Russian campaigns in particular have become a mounting
threat to European democracies and remain a significant challenge ahead
of the 2019 European parliament elections]{.underline}, [but other
groups (such as those on the **far-right) have also been active in
disinformation campaigns** in recent European
elections.]{.underline}2,[3]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Since disinformation is a problem with diverse and complicated roots,
the challenge of countering it does not land in any one portfolio. It
requires cooperation between different agencies within states and
internationally**.**]{.underline} [As an important co-regulatory
actor**,** this is where the European Union has a vital role to
play]{.underline}. Over the course of 2018, [the European Union has
stepped up its ambitions in countering disinformation campaigns through
a range of new initiatives]{.underline}.]{.mark}

#### [EU for Nato support to counter disinformation:]{.mark}

[Annina **Claesson**, April 8, **2019**, \"]{.mark}Coming Together to
Fight Fake News: Lessons from the European Approach to Disinformation,\"
CSIS,
https://www.csis.org/coming-together-fight-fake-news-lessons-european-approach-disinformation

[[There are several positive lessons to draw from these]{.underline}.
[Perhaps most importantly, the **European Commission has appropriately
identified the need for a unified,** multi-stakeholder response to
disinformation**, including participation from governments, civil
society, and the private sector**]{.underline}.4 The commission's most
recent action plan, released in December 2018, sets out important
improvements in this regard. [The EU budget for tackling disinformation
is expected to more than double in 2019]{.underline}, going from €1.[9
million in 2018 to €5 million]{.underline}.[5 This is not to be
disregarded]{.underline}---money matters a great deal, [especially when
Russia invests over €1 billion each year into their disinformation and
propaganda efforts]{.underline}.[6]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The action plan's most concrete new step is the creation of a rapid
alert system, which provides alerts on new disinformation campaigns as
they emerge in real time.7 This mechanism is set to involve NATO and
could become a promising tool for intelligence and data sharing across
borders**.**]{.underline} This action plan also strength- ens previously
under-resourced tools such as the East Strategic Communication Task
Force, an issue which was identified by experts as a significant
roadblock to improving anti-disinformation efforts in the European
Union.8]{.mark}

#### EU doesn't even think we should take action against disinformation but is doing it anyaway. 

Daniel **Funke**, **7-20**-2022, \"A guide to anti-misinformation
actions around the world,\" Poynter,
https://www.poynter.org/ifcn/anti-misinformation-actions/

[BRUSSELS]{.underline} --- In mid-March 2018, [a [European Commission
high-level group published its final report on
misinformation]{.mark}]{.underline}, drawing upon the input of experts
from around the world who gathered over several weeks to help the
European Union figure out what to do about misinformation. [The report
created by the high-level group]{.underline} --- [announced in November
2017 [to help the EU craft policies]{.mark} to address growing concern
about misinformation in Europe]{.underline} --- contains an inclusive,
[collaborative approach [to addres]{.mark}sing [misinformation]{.mark}
around the world]{.underline} (Disclosure: Poynter attended the meetings
as one of the experts). The report, while imperfect, [**[explicitly
recommends not regulating against misinformation]{.mark}**]{.underline}
--- [but the EU is only one of many governing bodies that have sought to
stem the flow of online misinformation over the past few
months]{.underline}. Spanning from Brazil to South Korea[**,** these
efforts [**raise questions about infringing free speech guarantees** and
are frequently victims of uncertainty. The muddying of the definition of
fake news]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the relative reach of which is still
being studied]{.underline}, **[[hinders governments' ability to
accomplish anything effective]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the spirit of
this confusion, explained in detail in a Council of Europe report,
[Poynter has created a guide for existing attempts to legislate against
what can broadly be referred to as online misinformation]{.underline}.
While not every law contained here relates to misinformation
specifically, they've all often been wrapped into that broader
discussion. We have attempted to label different interventions as
clearly as possible. Since these efforts seem to be announced weekly,
this article will be updated on an ongoing basis.

### AT: Vaccines

#### Belief of scientific narratives of covid are high. 

**Agley**, J., Xiao, Y., 1-7-**2021**, \"[Misinformation about
COVID-19]{.underline}: evidence for differential latent profiles and a
strong association with trust in science,\" BioMed Central,
[[https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-10103-x]{.underline}](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-10103-x)

[For the full sample]{.underline}, [believability of the narratives
varied]{.underline}, [from a low of 1]{.underline}.94 (SD=1.72) [for the
5G narrative to a high of 5]{.underline}.56 (SD=1.64) for the
[zoonotic]{.underline} ([scientific consensus]{.underline})
[narrative]{.underline}. [Four distinct belief profiles emerged, **with
the [preponderance (]{.mark}**[70%) of the sample]{.mark} falling into
Profile 1,]{.underline} which **[[believed the scientifically accepted
narrative]{.underline}]{.mark}** (zoonotic origin) [but [not the
misinformed]{.mark} or conspiratorial narratives.
[Other]{.mark}]{.underline} profiles [[did not disbelieve
the]{.underline} [zoonotic]{.underline}
[explanation]{.underline}]{.mark}, but rather believed additional
misinformation to varying [degrees.]{.underline} Controlling for
sociodemographics, political orientation and religious commitment were
marginally, and typically non-significantly, [associated with COVID-19
belief profile membership]{.underline}. However, [[trust in science
was]{.mark} a [strong]{.mark}]{.underline}, [significant predictor of
profile membership]{.underline}, with lower trust being substantively
associated with belonging to Profiles 2 through 4.

#### No link between misinformation and non-preventive disease behaviors. 

**Chan**, HW., Chiu, C.PY., Zuo, S. et al., 5-4-**2021**,
\"Not-so-straightforward links between believing in COVID-19-related
conspiracy theories and engaging in disease-preventive behaviours,\"
Nature, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-021-00781-2#Sec16

[Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic]{.underline}, pertinent
conspiracy theories have proliferated online, raising the question: [How
might believing in those conspiracy theories be linked with engagement
in disease-preventive behaviours? To answer this]{.underline}, [we
conducted a repeated cross-sectional survey of around 1500 respondents
to examine th[e link between conspiracy-theory beliefs and
disease-preventive behaviours]{.mark} across six time-points [in the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} from early February to late
March 2020[.]{.underline} The findings reveal that [[believing in
risk-acceptance]{.underline}]{.mark} conspiracy
[[theories]{.underline}]{.mark} ([RA-CTs]{.underline}; e.[g., "[COVID-19
is a man-made bioweapon") **was linked to more preventive
behaviours**]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [[believing in
risk-rejection]{.mark} conspiracy [theories]{.mark}]{.underline}
([RR-CTs]{.underline}; e.[g., "[COVID-19 is like influenza and was
purposefully exaggerated**") was associated with fewer preventive
behaviours**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[These differential links were
mediated by risk perception and negative emotions]{.mark} and modulated
by the stage of the outbreak]{.underline}---RA-CTs predicted higher risk
perception in the mild stage, whereas RR-CTs predicted lower risk
perception in the severe stage.

#### People also opposed early disease preventative measures due to contradictions and lack of transparency from health organizations.

Lu **He**,**21**, 2021 Apr 24, \"Why do people oppose mask wearing? A
comprehensive analysis of U.S. tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic,\"
PubMed Central (PMC),
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989302/

[Further]{.underline}, [[some]{.mark} users [opposed mask wearing
because they believed that it was **not an effective measure for
preventing the spread**]{.mark} of the virus [and]{.mark} it was
**[unnecessary for healthy individuals]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[**These
stances were indeed supported by authoritative bodies** such as the CDC
and the U]{.underline}.S. [Surgeon General at the early stage of the
pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, [many of these tweets were
posted in June and July]{.underline}, [yet the CDC had reversed its
position on public mask wearing in April]{.underline}. [[This finding
indicates that certain segments of the U]{.underline}.S. [population
might not be aware of]{.underline}, [or refuse to believe
in]{.underline}, [new recommendations from the CDC]{.underline}, [and
that earlier**, contradicting recommendations might have a long-lasting
impact.**]{.underline}]{.mark} [This means that public [health experts
and officials must clearly communicate]{.mark} about scientific
uncertainty]{.underline}, reasons for specific recommendations, [and the
possibility that recommendations could change as more evidence
emerges]{.underline}. In addition, [public health experts should
continue to engage the public so that new scientific
findings]{.underline}, conclusions, [and recommendations are immediately
delivered to all members of the public]{.underline}.

#### Masking is high, reliance on misinformation is low, disease spreading was just natural. 

Dennis **Thompson**, 10-22-**2020**, \"Mask Use by Americans Now Tops
90%, Poll Finds,\" WebMD,
<https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20201022/mask-use-by-americans-now-tops-90-poll-finds#1>

[More than nine in 10 [U**.S. adults (93%) said they sometimes,** often
or always wear a mask or face covering when they leave their home and
are unable to socially distance**,** including more than seven in 10
**(72%) who said they always do so**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the poll
revealed]{.underline}. \"[Compared to when we first asked this question
in late August]{.underline}, [our latest survey with HealthDay finds
that [more Americans are now consistently wearing a mask or face
covering outside the home,\"]{.mark} said Kathy Steinberg]{.underline},
[vice president of research for public release at The Harris
Poll]{.underline}.

### AT: European Populism

#### **Populism declined drastically due to leaders' mishandling of the pandemic and is unpopular in the squo -- no democratic backsliding** 

**B**ennett **I**nstitute of **P**ublic **P**olicy **Cambridge 22** --
The Bennett Institute of Public Policy is an organization at the
University of Cambridge that researches public policy and politics.
(\"Support for populist politics 'collapsed' during the pandemic --
global report,\" Bennett Institute for Public Policy, 1-18-2022,
https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/blog/great-reset/, Accessed
7-20-2022, LASA-KS)

[[Support for populist parties and politicians]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
agreement with populist sentiment, has [[diminished during the
pandemi]{.mark}c]{.underline}, [according to a "mega-dataset" taking in
attitudes of over half a million people across 109 countries since
2020]{.underline}. A University of Cambridge team say there are
**[[clear signs of a turning tide for the "populist wave", as the
mishandling of coronavirus by populist leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}** --
along with a desire for stability and a decline in "polarising"
attitudes resulting from the pandemic -- starts to move public opinion.
The authors of the new report, from Cambridge's Centre for the Future of
Democracy (CFD), describe the study as the first global overview of how
the Covid-19 crisis has affected political beliefs. They say that
threats posed by the pandemic saw a "technocratic" shift in political
authority worldwide, with increased trust in government, and in experts
such as scientists and civil servants. Yet faith in the democratic
process has continued to falter. "The story of politics in recent years
has been the emergence of anti-establishment politicians who thrive on
the growing distrust of experts," said Dr Roberto Foa, Co-Director of
the CFD and the report's lead author. ["From Erdogan and Bolsonaro to
the 'strong men' of Eastern Europe, the planet has experienced a wave of
political populism. Covid-19 may have caused that wave to
crest."]{.underline} "Electoral support for populist parties has
collapsed around the world in a way we don't see for more mainstream
politicians. **[There is strong evidence that the [pandemic has severely
blunted the rise of populism]{.mark},"]{.underline}** said Foa. The
findings are published today by Cambridge's Bennett Institute for Public
Policy. The first months of the pandemic saw many political leaders get
a boost in ratings -- a classic "rally round the flag" effect in
troubled times, say researchers. However, the [approval ratings of
populist leaders the world over began declining almost as soon as
coronavirus hit,]{.underline} and have [continued to sink ever
since]{.underline}. On average, populist leaders have seen a 10
percentage point drop between the spring of 2020 and the last quarter of
2021, while [ratings for non-populists -- on average -- returned to
around pre-pandemic levels]{.underline}. **[El[ectoral support also
plunged for their parties -- seen most clearly in
Europe]{.mark},]{.underline}** where the [proportion of people intending
to vote for a populist party\* has fallen by an average of 11 percentage
points to 27%.]{.underline} Overall, across Europe, early lockdowns saw
voting intention for incumbent parties increase. Yet all the continent's
governing populists -- from Italy's Five Star to Hungary's Fidezs --
bucked the trend with the largest declines in support. Support for
Europe's opposition populist parties also fell over the pandemic -- by 5
pp on average to 11% -- while it rose for "mainstream" opposition.
Researchers suggest several factors for populism's fading appeal. One is
simply the botch job made of the pandemic by populist governments: from
Bolsonaro's mask veto to Trump's "bleach injection" suggestion. The
report's polling shows [the [public considered populist leaders to be
less trustworthy]{.mark} sources of virus-related information than
centrist counterparts.]{.underline} In June 2020, approval of government
handling of the crisis was 11 percentage points lower on average in
countries with populist leaders than in those with more centrist
governance. By the end of 2020, this gap had widened to 16 points.
Researchers also found that political "tribalism" -- fertile ground for
populists -- has declined in most countries. The percentage of party
supporters expressing a "strong dislike" of those who vote for opposing
politicians fell in most nations (although not the US) during the
crisis. ["The [pandemic fostered a sense of shared purpose that may have
reduced the political polarisation]{.mark} we've seen over the last
decade,"]{.underline} said CFD researcher and report co-author Dr Xavier
Romero-Vidal. "This could help explain why populist leaders are
struggling to mobilise support." Some of the ideas propagated by
populists are losing ground. Levels of agreement with statements such as
"corrupt elites" divide our nation or the "will of the people" should be
obeyed fell in almost every nation surveyed.

#### Populism is inevitable and a structural cause -- drastic changes in social and economic affairs means misinformation is not key to its buildup in European politics -- the aff won't solve populism with the plan 

Sheri **Berman 19** -- Berman teaches political science at Barnard
College at Columbia University and writes scholarly articles of the
political landscape of Europe. (\"Populism is a Symptom Rather than a
Cause: Democratic Disconnect, the Decline of the Center-Left, and the
Rise of Populism in Western Europe,\" Polity, 9-26-2019,
https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/705378?journalCode=pol,
Accessed 7-21-2022, LASA-KS)

How can we understand the rise of populism in Europe? Perhaps the most
common approach is to look at the demand side, or the [[long-term
structural changes]{.mark} that are [said to have caused growing
dissatisfaction with democracy and growing support for
populism]{.mark}.]{.underline} This debate is primarily between those
who stress economic factors and those who stress social factors. The
[former camp emphasizes the [disruptive effects of globalization,
neolib]{.mark}eralism[, and technological change]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In this view, [increasing trade openness, the rise of non-Western
economic powers, diminished government regulation]{.underline}, and
[growing automation]{.underline} have made life more insecure for the
working and middle classes, have privileged highly educated and urban
dwellers over less-educated and rural ones, and have made capitalism
more of a zero-sum game.\' **[[These forces have also aggravated
divisions within societies]{.underline}]{.mark}** and between them. Over
the past few decades, the economic winners have been the rising mid die
classes in developing countries such as India and China and the wealthy
in the West. The losers, meanwhile, have primarily been the lower and
middle classes in the West, which explains their resentment of emerging
economic powers as well as of elites in their own countries. The
**[impact of these changes was exacerbated by the [financial crisis of
the late 2000s]{.mark}, which [deepened social divisions and economic
fears]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A different narrative stresses **[[social
change as the root cause of populism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Over the
past years, the [foreign-born share of the population has reached
historic heights]{.underline} in most European countries. The impact of
this [demographic shift was aggravated by [the refugee crisis]{.mark} of
2015]{.underline} and the [fear generated by [high-profile terrorist
incidents]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the November 2015 [[Islamist
attacks in Paris]{.underline}]{.mark}, which killed over 400 people, and
the December 2016 Islamist attack in Berlin that left a dozen people
dead. The growth in the number of foreign-born residents, particularly
of non-European backgrounds, occurred against the backdrop of an assault
on traditional values that began the 1960s. According to this narrative,
the [cumulative impact of these change is that many
citizens]{.underline}, particularly white males, have come to [feel like
strangers in their own countries]{.underline}. In this view, **[social
change has [led to a nativist or even racist
backlash]{.mark},]{.underline}** with **[[citizens growing dissatisfied
with liberal democracy for allowing the decline of national cultures,
traditions, and sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}**. More recently,
[scholars have focused on the interaction between social and economic
change]{.underline}. Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris argue that,
during the postwar period, prosperity prompted a generational shift
towards post-materialist values in the advanced industrial world that in
turn prompted a reaction among more materialist voters. But this
reaction exploded onto the [political scene only when rising economic
insecurity activated traditionalist and xenophobic attitudes that were
already present.]{.underline} In a different analysis, Noam Gidron and
Peter Hall stress the intraction of economic and social grievances,
arguing that the decline of wellpaying, secure, respected jobs and the
[[growing prominence and mobilization of women]{.mark} and minorities
has combined to threaten the dominant status of white males in Western
societies]{.underline}, [[leading to dissatisfaction with the political
establishment and growing support for populist
parti]{.underline}es]{.mark} championing what they claim
are\"[traditional\" national identities and [romanticizing an earlier
s]{.mark}tatus [quo]{.mark}]{.underline}.\' As real and as
**[consequential]{.underline}** as these **[economic and social
changes]{.underline}** have been, a focus on them alone can only reveal
so much about the problems facing liberal democracy today. **[[Populism
is a symptom or reflection of growing dissatisfaction with
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [that [dissatisfaction emerges
when citizens believe that]{.mark} elites, parties, and [governments are
unwilling or unable to respond to their needs and
demands]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Change]{.underline} alone, in
other words, [is]{.underline} not [destabilizing]{.underline}\--it
becomes so only [if political institutions do not manage or mitigate
it.]{.underline} To understand populism, inshort, one must examine how
(or whether) elites, parties, and governments haven responded to the
challenges that European societies have confronted over the last few
decades. [In democracies]{.underline}, unlike in dictatorships, [[when
citizens become dissatisfied, they can express that dissatisfaction by
voting to change their leaders]{.mark} and governments]{.underline}. But
[i[f citizens believe their votes do not matter-if their leaders and
governments do not respond to their needs]{.mark} and demands\--then
their [willingness to vote for parties critical]{.mark} of \"the
establishment\" and [of democracy]{.mark} more generally [will
grow]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Turn -- Populism in opposition is good for democracy because it keeps the elite in check -- no democratic backsliding in Europe, just a positive feedback loop to correct democracy 

Jane **Mansbridge** and Stephen **Macedo 20** -- Mansbridge is the
professor of political science Kennedy School of Government at Harvard
University. She is one of the world's most prominent scholars of
democratic theory. Macedo is the Laurance S. Rockefeller Professor of
Politics at Princeton University and he focuses on topics related to
liberalism and democracy.(\"Populism and Democratic Theory,\"Annual

Accessed 7-21-2022, LASA-KS)

Commentators routinely describe \"[populism]{.underline}\" as vague.
Some argue that the early US populists, who coined the modern usage,
were not populists. We disagree and identify this common conceptual
core: the \"people\" in a moral battle against \"elites.\" The core
definition fits all cases of populism: those on the left and right,
those in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. In addition to this
minimal common core, we identify strongly suggested and frequently
correlated non-core characteristics. These include the people\'s
homogeneity and exclusivity, direct rule, and nationalism, as well as a
single leader, vilification of vulnerable out-groups, and impatience
with deliberation. The US Populist Party and Spain\'s Podemos Party fit
the core definition but have few of the other characteristics. The core
[can be good for democracy]{.underline}, we argue, [while the associated
characteristics are often dangerous. [Populism in opposition can be good
for democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}, while populism in power carries
great risks. We further distinguish, with many others (e.g., Judis 2016;
Kazin 2017b; Mudde & Kaltwasser 2017; Müller 2016; Urbinati 2014,
2019a), between populism in opposition and populism in power. [Populism
in opposition [often revitalizes democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} when the
populist ideals and moral fervor anmating antagonism to entrenched
elites crack through a prevailing political and discursive hegemony,
bringing concerns that had been ignored or suppressed into the political
arena. Yet populism in power poses risks to democracy. The same moral
fervor and us/them dichotomy that help disrupt the entrenched political
and cultural order when populists are in opposition militates against
the mutual respect, tolerance, forbearance, negotiation, compromise, and
respect for constitutional institutions necessary for egalitarian and
pluralist democratic politics when populists take power. The **[[core
elements of populism are not antidemocratic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. On
the contrary, when a large group has designated itself \"the people\"
and has come to see itself in a moral battle against \"the elites,\" the
members of that group have often had significant interests and values
that political elites have neglected or even denigrated. At these
moments, **[[populism is democracy\'s way of saying, \"Listen
harder.\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** Although [[ordinary
citizens]{.underline}]{.mark} are not policy experts, they [[are in a
position to judge]{.mark} how their lives are going,]{.underline} and
[when they have long-standing grievances that powerful elites have
not]{.underline} effectively [addressed]{.underline}, organizing in
protest is a rationally and [[emotionally appropriate democratic
response]{.mark}. **[Democracy particularly needs the populist impulse
at certain historical moments.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[Elites]{.underline} often [develop interests and values that diverge
from those]{.underline}]{.mark} [of the less affluent]{.underline}, less
educated[, and [less privileged who live far from centers of]{.mark}
political, economic, social, and cultural [power]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Thev often talk primarily with one another and reinforce one another.
Power tends to beget more power. **[[When groups with more power neglect
the values and interests of the less powerful for too long, populism is
what we want from democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. the capacity to let
the needs and values of the less powerful break through and thrust
themselves on the increasingly insulated political, economic, social,
and cultural ruling classes.

### AT: ISIS

#### ISIS [not]{.underline} a threat\-\--[miniscule]{.underline} movements and impacts 

Fareed **Zakaria**, **21**, Zakaria is a columnist focusing on foreign
affairs. He studied at Yale College and Harvard University, and is the
host of CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS and contributing editor for the
Atlantic; "**[[Ten years later, Islamist terrorism isn't the threat it

===says far-right terrorism is dangerous but if the impact's just
[ISIS]{.underline} terrorism then we should be fine

This weekend marks the 10th anniversary of the operation, code-named
Neptune Spear, that killed Osama bin Laden. It's an opportunity to
reflect on the state of Islamist terrorism and radical Islam more
generally. And the initial diagnosis is clear: **[The [movement]{.mark}
is [in bad shape]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Total deaths caused by
terrorism around the world]{.mark} have [plummeted by 59 percent]{.mark}
since their peak in 2014.]{.underline}** In the West, the current threat
is less from Islamist violence than far-right terrorism, which has
surged by 250 percent in the same period, and now makes up 46 percent of
attacks and 82 percent of deaths.

[Most [Islamist terrorism]{.mark} today tends to be
**local**]{.underline} --- the Taliban in Afghanistan, Boko Haram in
Nigeria, al-Shabab in the Horn of Africa. That's a major reversal from
the glory days of al-Qaeda, when its leaders insisted that the focus
must be not on the "near enemy" (the local regimes) but rather the "far
enemy" (the United States and the West more broadly). Al-Qaeda has
disintegrated into a bunch of militias in disparate places with no
central command or ideology. The [Islamic State]{.underline} is doing
slightly better, with more funds, but it, too, **[[searches for]{.mark}
unstable or [ungoverned]{.mark} places]{.underline}**, such as
Mozambique, where it can operate. **[This [focus on local conflicts
erodes]{.mark} any global [appeal]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Muslims around
the world do not identify with local causes in Mozambique or Somalia.

Militant Islam, which began to flourish in the 1970s, rooted its appeal
in failure --- the failure of the dictatorships and monarchies of the
Arab world to develop their societies. Islamists urged Muslims to give
up on Western-style modernization, which had led only to poverty and
tyranny, and to embrace instead the idea of political Islam --- the road
to an Islamic state. People such as bin Laden and his associate Ayman
al-Zawahiri turned political Islam into militant Islam because they
argued it was the only way to topple the dictatorships of the Arab world
and beyond. They urged terrorism against those regimes but most
importantly, against the superpower that supported them --- the United
States.

In an essay in the journal Religions, Nader Hashemi points out that the
allure of political Islam was always that of an untested opposition
movement, a mystical alternative to the shoddy reality that existed on
the ground in the Muslim world. But over the past few decades, Islamist
parties have entered the political process in Iraq, Sudan, Tunisia,
Egypt, Gaza, Jordan and other places. "One general theme stands," writes
Hashemi. "The popular prestige of political Islam has been tarnished by
its experience with state power."

Millions of Muslims have now seen political Islam in action --- and they
don't like it. They fled the Islamic State caliphate in droves. They
protested against the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. They watched Shiite
parties in Iraq turn into corrupt patronage operations. And in Iran,
they continue to be deeply disenchanted by that country's theocratic
government. The oxygen that fed political Islam --- disgust with the
current regimes and blind faith in the promise of religious leaders ---
has been severely depleted.

**[What remains now are [local problems]{.mark}, local discontents that
are really [not part of]{.mark} some great [global movement]{.mark}.
It's true in the West as well.]{.underline}** There has been a spate of
Islamist attacks in France, but these were all carried out by
individuals not previously known to the police and not part of any known
jihadi groups. They were self-radicalized, with their own personal
discomforts leading them to a radical ideology.

In this sense, Islamist attacks in Europe have something in common with
far-right attacks in the United States. Alienated individuals,
radicalizing online, find ideologies that weaponize their fears and
furies. [America has many more alienated White men these days than
Muslims, hence the changing composition of the terrorism on its
soil.]{.underline}

The lessons to draw about Islam, Islamist terrorism and the prospects
for democracy in Islamic countries are complicated and varied. 2021 is
also the 10th anniversary of the Arab Spring, when millions of Arabs
tried to peacefully protest for democracy and human rights, a movement
that sprouted up again over the past few years in Algeria, Sudan,
Lebanon and Iraq. Though these efforts have had limited success, they
show powerfully that Arabs and Muslims want freedom and democracy far
more than they do a caliphate.

#### International deterrence, captures, and neutralization have [eliminated]{.underline} the threat of ISIS

Orwa **Ajjoub, 22**, Ajjoub is a senior analyst at COAR global focusing
on jihadism and Syria. He previously worked as an affiliated researcher
at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Lund University; "ISIS has a
new leader. It's important to understand their operational capacity.",

https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/isis-has-a-new-leader-its-important-to-understand-their-operational-capacity-%EF%BF%BC/chuo

There are two types of jihad in the jihadi world that are determined by
the reality on the ground and the jihadi groups' capabilities: jihad
al-tamkin, or jihad of empowerment, and jihad al-nikaya, or jihad of
vexation and exhaustion. Under the former, the group seeks to control
and rule over a geographical area and impose its interpretation of
Islam. Under the latter, the goal is to inflict harm on the enemy's
interests with hit and run tactics suited to its lack of territory and
manpower. Al-nikaya includes ambushes, suicide bombings, attacking
prisons, and assassinations of leading enemy figures and collaborators.
In 2014, when ISIS announced the establishment of its so-called
caliphate, which stretched between eastern Syria and western Iraq, it
shifted from jihad al-nikaya to jihad al-tamkin. However, [with its loss
of territories and assets, which started in 2016, the group has
gradually but systematically returned to jihad al-nikaya]{.underline}.

While al-Qaeda has been largely loyal to al-nikaya---as evidenced by the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks as well as the 2004 Madrid and 2005
London bombings---claiming that it wasn't yet time to announce the
establishment of the caliphate, ISIS hasn't only alternated between the
two based on the reality on the ground but also merged during its heyday
between 2010 and 2014, as noted by scholar Hassan Abu Hannyia.

[[ISIS]{.mark}'s attempt to free its fighters from prisons isn't new and
**reflects the group's [increase]{.mark}d [need for
manpower]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In November 2021, the SDF and US-led
international coalition thwarted a plot by a suspected ISIS cell in
eastern Deir ez-Zor province, which was planning to attack the same
prison. **[The [group's manpower]{.mark} has significantly
[diminished]{.mark} since its territorial defeat in 2019. Thousands of
[attacks]{.mark} in Syria and Iraq has [worn ISIS down]{.mark}, [as well
as]{.mark} its [enemies' ability to neutralize or capture thousands
of]{.mark} its [fighters]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

According to Jihad Analytics, a consultancy company on global and cyber
jihad, ISIS claimed 1,764 and 3,144 attacks in Syria and Iraq,
respectively, between March 2019 and January 2022. [While a 2019 United
Nations (UN) report estimated that ISIS had up to eighteen thousand
fighters, including three thousand foreign fighters operating in Syria
and Iraq,]{.underline} **[a recent [2022 UN assessment]{.mark}
[claims]{.mark} that the group has only retained between six thousand
and ten thousand, which means that [ISIS has lost almost half of its
fighters via death or capture]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Today, the SDF
still holds ten thousand ISIS fighters in its prisons, which is seen as
a valuable pool for the **[group's [drained rank and
file]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This was reflected by two speeches made by
ISIS spokesman, Abu Hamza al-Qurashi, in June and October 2021, in which
he explicitly called his supporters to free ISIS inmates from SDF
prisons.

**[The [international war against ISIS]{.mark} has [deprived]{.mark} the
[group of]{.mark} the [territories it once controlled]{.mark} and
clamped down on regional borders, [closing the pipeline]{.mark} of
foreign fighters coming into Syria, most of whom are known for their
ideological intransigence and fighting experiences.]{.underline}** [This
reality has pushed the group to rely more on local fighters, who don't
necessarily believe in its ideology but, rather, were pushed by local
grievances generated by social inequality, political exclusion, and a
lack of better options.]{.underline}

===uhh not the best card

One of the clearest signs that the **[[ISIS threat]{.mark} was [not
imminent]{.mark}]{.underline}** at the time the counter-ISIS war was
initiated is that the government itself repeatedly and via various
institutions assessed that there was no known evidence of a direct ISIS
threat to the homeland. The government continued to share this
assessment long after the decision to initiate the counter-ISIS war was
made, suggesting that it did not view its initial assessment as
incorrect.

Among those who made such comments are President Obama himself, who on
September 10, while authorizing the escalation of the war into Syria
stated that "we have not yet detected specific plotting against our
homeland."162 National Counterterrorism Center Director Matt Olsen said
that "we have no credible information that ISIL is planning to attack
the United States" and described the threat as potential, adding there
was no evidence of ISIS cell development inside the United States.163
Also in September, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson
stated, "At present, we have [[no credible info]{.mark}rmation [that
\[ISIS]{.mark}\] is [plan]{.mark}ning [to attack]{.mark} the homeland of
the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline}"164 In August 2014,
Pentagon Spokesperson Rear Admiral John Kirby stated that the Defense
Department did not believe that ISIS had "the capability right now to
conduct a major attack on the U.S. homeland."165 Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey also stated in August that there
had not yet been evidence that ISIS was engaged in "active plotting
against the homeland, so it's different than that which we see in
Yemen."166 Nor did officials change their assessment with the beginning
of the military campaign. In February 2015, Department of Homeland
Security Undersecretary for the Office of Intelligence and Analysis
Francis X. Taylor said, "We are unaware of any specific, credible,
imminent threat to the Homeland."167

The Department of Homeland Security's National Terrorism Advisory System
(NTAS) provides another set of evidence of the government's lack of
knowledge of any direct ISIS threat to the homeland. In April 2011, the
Department of Homeland Security replaced the infamous color-coded
Homeland Security Advisory system with NTAS. Under the NTAS system, an
alert would be sent out when there was important information
distinguishing between either an "elevated" threat with no specific
information on timing or location or an "imminent" threat otherwise.168
Even as ISIS spread across Iraq and the United States initiated its
counter-ISIS war in 2014, NTAS provided no alerts until December 2015,
when it issued its first bulletin.169

The first bulletin, released on December 16, 2015, read, "We know of no
intelligence that is both specific and credible at this time of a plot
by terrorist organizations to attack the homeland."170 The first
bulletin was replaced by a second bulletin issued on June 15, 2016 that
stated the previous bulletin's "basic assessment has not changed."171 In
the wake of the deadly ISIS-inspired attack in Orlando, the bulletin
again repeated that "we know of no intelligence that is both specific
and credible at this time of a plot by terrorist organizations to attack
the homeland" while reiterating the threat of inspired violence, which
was also described in the previous bulletin.172

[One of the clearest signs that the ISIS threat was not imminent is that
the [gov]{.mark}ernment **[repeatedly]{.mark}** and via various
institutions [assessed]{.mark} that there was [no]{.mark} known
[ev]{.mark}idence [of]{.mark} a [direct ISIS threat]{.mark} to the
homeland.]{.underline}

In November 2016 a new bulletin again reported no change in the basic
assessment, emphasized inspired violence, and reiterated the lack of
evidence of credible plots to attack the homeland by foreign terrorist
organizations.173

However, it seems unlikely that this change represented newfound
organizational plots against the United States. **[The bulk of the
bulletin remains focused on inspired and enabled violence, no alert was
provided regarding an imminent threat, and the bulletin came as [ISIS\'s
territorial holdings crumbled]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Another set of sources for evaluating the government's assessment of the
ISIS threat to the homeland is the U.S. intelligence community's
Worldwide Threat Assessments. These assessments repeatedly stated that
the most likely threat to the United States remained homegrown terrorism
rather than ISIS-directed attacks.177 Though none of these assessments
include language denying foreign terrorist organization plots, it would
be odd if there was a major credible threat and the assessments failed
to mention it while emphasizing homegrown, inspired violence.

Government statements are limited in their ability to measure whether
there is in fact a direct threat. They can be incorrect in their
assessments or the threat can grow rapidly after an assessment is
made.178 It is therefore important to also look at the indicators
themselves.

The primary indicator of threat referenced in justifying the need for
military action to respond to growing risks to the homeland was the
large number of foreign fighters traveling to Syria and Iraq.179 Other
oft-cited indicators included the extent of territory and money
available to ISIS, which could allow it to be selective in recruiting
for and preparing sophisticated elite-staffed attack plots from its safe
haven and its ability to launch multiple attack plots without needing
each one to succeed.180 These indicators are very real sources of
concern, yet they **[do not constitute evidence of a direct threat that
would turn America's preventive logic into a preemptive
logic]{.underline}**.

There is a geographic split in the indicators. The above indicators of
threat exist on the Syria and Iraq side of the ledger, describing how
ISIS managed to build an unprecedented safe haven that could potentially
pose a risk to the homeland and absolutely posed a threat to those
living in or near ISIS\'s territory. In contrast, viewed from the United
States' side, the indicators did not show a substantial threat to the
homeland. In the 18 years since 9/11, no jihadist foreign terrorist
organization has carried out a deadly attack inside the United States
and no foreign fighter or individual who received terrorist training181
abroad has carried out a deadly attack, according to New America's
research.182

ISIS\'s rise sparked fears that the United States' record of success in
avoiding attacks might change. **[Yet [more than five years
after]{.mark} the United States' initiation of a [counterterrorism
war]{.mark}, and eight [years into]{.mark} the [Syrian conflict]{.mark},
there is [little ev]{.mark}idence [that ISIS developed]{.mark} the
[capability to direct attacks inside the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline}** Of course, it is possible that, absent
intervention, ISIS would have developed the capability, but that is a
preventive logic. **[[If ISIS had]{.mark} the [capability]{.mark} prior
to the initiation of the war, it would be expected that [there would
be]{.mark} some evidence of that capability's [development by
now]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

More than five years after the United States' initiation of a
counterterrorism war, and eight years into the Syrian conflict, **[there
is little evidence ISIS developed the capability to direct attacks
inside the United States]{.underline}**.

The number of Americans who joined ISIS or otherwise traveled to fight
in Syria was relatively low compared to other countries. In August 2014,
the government placed the number of Americans fighting with any faction
in Syria at 100 people, and National Counterterrorism Center Director
Matthew Olsen confirmed that the number fighting with ISIS was likely
about a dozen individuals.188 The United States' latest updated count is
that 300 Americans went or attempted to fight with any group in
Syria.189

Far from discussing an influx of returnees to the United States, Olsen
portrayed it as a matter of individuals returning.190 Public tracking of
known returnees has identified relatively few who returned to the United
States, many of whom came back under the supervision of law
enforcement.191 Whatever the true number, it is far from the feared wave
of returnees.

While many pointed to the Afghan conflict as an example of the danger of
foreign fighter flows, in the more recent foreign fighter mobilization
to Somalia, no returnee to the United States was accused of plotting an
attack.192 It is reasonable to suggest that ISIS was a different type of
organization with more power and thus posed a greater threat of attacks
on the homeland than al Shabaab.193 On the other hand, it is worth
noting that prior to 9/11, the United States did very little to track
jihadist foreign fighters, making the Afghanistan case a questionable
comparison for post-9/11 threat assessments.194

The amount in question in the Elshinawy case is small and not dissimilar
from what ISIS sympathizers are able to raise via means of
self-financing.200 Four men were able to raise that amount of funds in a
case based out of San Diego to send to al Shabaab in 2007 and 2008.201
In addition, the threat was not dependent on ISIS\'s territory in Syria,
and could be more effective when conducted from outside of Syria in a
dispersed network of the kind likely to be left after military
action.202 The Elshinawy case provides a warning regarding jihadist
innovations, but it does not demonstrate a great capability of ISIS to
finance terror inside the United States.

in the belief that the U.S. is "distracted" by the Ukraine
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**, said Avril Haines, Director of National
Intelligence, during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. She also
said that while there's no clear end in sight to Russia's invasion, the
Intelligence Community doubts Russia will quit, but also doubts Russia
will resort to nuclear weapons in the near future. Senators lauded the
Intelligence Community for correctly predicting the Ukraine war, but
criticized it for its failure to predict Ukraine's success in resisting
the invasion and Russia's troubles in carrying it out. "Thus far, the
**[[IC does not assess that the Russia-Ukraine crisis is likely to
accelerate \[China's\] plan vis-a-vis Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**,"
Haines said on May 10. China was "surprised by the degree to which [the
[United States and Europe came together]{.underline}]{.mark} to enact
sanctions, and [[that is something they]{.underline}]{.mark} obviously
[[will be looking at in the context of Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark},"
Haines said. Also, "one of the issues for them is the confidence they
have that they are able to take action in Taiwan over our intervention."
This will "play into their decision-making over time." Seeing events
unfold in Ukraine "may give them less confidence, in some respects, over
what is likely to happen" in a Taiwan invasion, Haines said. Haines and
Defense Intelligence Agency chief Lt. Gen. Scott D. Berrier said 2027 is
the point at which the U.S. thinks China believes it could prevail over
a U.S. intervention to pull off a successful Taiwan invasion, noting
China may therefore accelerate that date. They also said Taiwan needs to
do more to prepare to defend itself, both in equipment and the structure
of its military.

### AT: Iran Cyber

#### No motive\-\--they [keep it small]{.underline} to [avoid]{.underline} escalation

Dr. James Andrew **Lewis 18**, Senior Vice President at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, Ph.D. from the University of
Chicago, January 2018, "Rethinking Cybersecurity: Strategy, Mass Effect,
and States," <https://tinyurl.com/y27xcqbb>, p. 7-11

The Russians specialize in coercion, financial crime, and creating
harmful cognitive effect---the ability to manipulate emotions and
decisionmaking. Under their 2010 military doctrine on disruptive
information operations (part of what they call \"New Generation
Warfare\"). Russians want confusion, not physical damage.
**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}** and North Korea [use [cyber
actions]{.mark} against American banks or entertainment companies like
Sony or the Sands Casino, but their [goal is **political coercion**, not
**destruction**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[**[None]{.mark}** of these countries [talk about]{.mark} death by 1000

produce]{.mark} a **cyber [Pearl Harbor]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} any of the
other [scenarios that **dominate**]{.mark} **the
[media]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The few disruptive attacks on critical
infrastructure have focused almost exclusively on the energy sector.
[Major financial institutions face a high degree of risk but in most
cases, the attackers\' intent is to extract money]{.underline}. [There
have been [cases]{.mark} of service disruption and data erasure, but
these [have been **limited**]{.mark} in scope.
**[D]{.mark}**enial-**[o]{.mark}**f-**[s]{.mark}**ervice attacks against
banks impede services and may be costly to the targeted bank, but **[do
not have]{.mark} a [major effect]{.mark} on the national

line]{.mark} that [countries have been unwilling to
cross]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[When our [opponents]{.mark} decided to challenge American \"hegemony,\"
they developed strategies to [circumvent]{.mark} the risks of
**[retal]{.mark}**iation or escalation [by **ensuring**]{.mark} **that
their [actions stay]{.mark}ed [below]{.mark} the [use-of-force
threshold]{.mark}**]{.underline}---an imprecise threshold, roughly
defined by international law, but usually considered to involve actions
that produce destruction or casualties. [**Almost [all]{.mark} cyber
[attacks fall below this]{.mark} threshold, including, crime, espionage,
and politically coercive acts**. This explains why the decades-long
quest to rebuild Cold War deterrence in cyberspace has been
fruitless.]{.underline}

[It also explains why we have not seen the dreaded cyber Pearl Harbor or
other predicted catastrophes.]{.underline} [Opponents are keenly aware
that launching catastrophe brings with it immense risk of receiving
catastrophe in return]{.underline}. [States are the only actors who can
carry out [catastrophic]{.mark} cyber [attacks]{.mark} and they [are
**very unlikely**]{.mark} to do so in a strategic environment that seeks
to gain advantage without engaging in armed conflict]{.underline}.
Decisions on targets and attack make sense only when embedded in their
larger strategic calculations regarding how best to fight with the
United States.

#### Iran avoids escalation and focuses on using lobbying instead

Ali **Hajizade**, 20 May ,20**20**, \"Iran's selective approach to
hybrid war,\" Al Arabiya English,
https://english.alarabiya.net/views/news/middle-east/2018/02/23/Iran-s-selective-approach-to-hybrid-war

During the cold war, the world witnessed various proxy wars, involving
USSR and the USA, and their official and unofficial allies. Moscow and
Washington managed to wage proxy wars in Vietnam, Angola, Afghanistan
and other parts of the world.

Now there is no Warsaw block, and proxy wars could seemingly become
history. However, it did not happen. In today's world, certain regional
players have adopted the Soviet method of waging proxy wars. Speaking of
the Middle East, we should emphasize Iran's activity.

Strategists from Tehran are to be lauded; they improved the Soviet
methods and transformed them into a system of a comprehensive hybrid
war, including the application of modern technologies. Today, Iran's
permanent hybrid war is mainly directed against three countries -- USA,
Israel and Saudi Arabia. However, Tehran is selective about the approach
to each of these countries.

Iran has a separate strategy for each of these countries. However, in
each case [[Iran tries to avoid a straightforward confrontation]{.mark}.
For example, the situation with US is much more nuanced than with Israel
or Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}

For instance, [[Iranian authorities]{.underline}]{.mark} declare vicious
slogans against "Great Satan", but at the same time, they spend great
financial resources and energy to create[, [expand and
support]{.underline}]{.mark} [Iranian [Lobby]{.mark} in US.]{.underline}
These efforts continued even when Iran, not directly, but through Shiite
armed militias was involved in a military conflict with the US army in
Iraq. Iranians have been contacting with representatives of the Iraqi
opposition since Saddam Hussein's years in power.

The American invasion freed Iran's hands and Tehran was able to fully
use its ties and influence over Shiites in Iraq. Thus, Iraq turned into
a failed state, possessing a role of a buffer zone for Iran.

They could establish very valuable ties with a certain part (mainly with
the liberal wing) of the American and European political establishment
through the work of Iranian Lobby in US and EU.

Ethnic Iranians including Iranians who have dual citizenship participate
in the work of Iranian Lobby together with citizens of Western
countries, among which there are politicians, social activists, experts
and journalists. The Head of Iran's intelligence Mahmoud Alavi
explicitly stated this in the interview.

The main objective of Iranian Lobby in Washington is to counteract
activities of Jewish Lobby and activities of Israel, Saudi Arabia and
UAE in Washington. In particular, in matters regarding Iran, for example
Iranian nuclear program, Iran's missile program, matters related to
tightening of sanctions against Iran and Iran's ties with terrorist
organizations.

#### Cyber attacks are not severe and countries sought to avoid violent conflicts

Jason **Healey**, 3-9-20**22**, \"Preventing Cyber Escalation in Ukraine
and After,\" War on the Rocks,
https://warontherocks.com/2022/03/preventing-cyber-escalation-in-ukraine-and-after/

So far[[, cyber attacks have not proven]{.mark} particularly [escalatory
or effective]{.mark} on the battlefield. Even [the most provocative
incidents]{.mark}]{.underline} that came closest to resembling kinetic
attacks, such as Stuxnet or the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline,
[[have not led to]{.mark} particularly menacing [crises,]{.mark} much
less [war]{.mark}]{.underline}. If anything, over the past decade cyber
capabilities have helped de-escalate crises, acting as a "non-kinetic
option for leaders who feel pressure to act in a crisis, but who are
wary of using force."

The U.S. conflict with Iran offers a clear example. After Iran attacked
several oil tankers and downed a U.S. drone in June 2019, President
Donald Trump canceled punitive U.S. airstrikes at the last minute out of
concern that the casualties could prompt further escalation. However, he
allowed nonlethal cyber disruption of Iranian computer systems,
anticipating Iran would not respond violently. Indeed, Iran's supreme
leader "blocked any large, direct retaliation," limiting the country's
response to the cyber realm.

Scholars have offered different explanations for the non-escalatory
nature of these attacks. [C[yber effects are "uncertain and often
relatively limited]{.underline}]{.mark}[" and "offer great powers
escalatory offramps \[and\] signaling mechanisms"]{.underline} to
de-escalate. In the "cyber strategic competitive space short of armed
conflict," states have "tacitly agreed on lower and upper bounds" and
accordingly "have [mutua[l interests in avoiding escalation to violent
conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline}" Cyber conflict also has characteristics
of an intelligence, not military, contest.

#### Russia's invasion on Ukraine has undermined cohesion in NATO and EU countries due to disagreements on sanctions

Luigi **Scazzieri**, 6-15-20**22**, \"Have we passed the high-water mark
of European unity on Ukraine?,\"
EUROPP, <https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2022/06/15/have-we-passed-the-high-water-mark-of-european-unity-on-ukraine/>

EU leaders presented a united response in the immediate aftermath
of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Yet as the war continues, th**is unity
is coming under strain**. Luigi Scazzieri argues there is now a real
risk that rifts sparked by the conflict could become entrenched,
undermining European cohesion on issues far beyond the war in Ukraine.

When Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine in February this
year, EU leaders quickly agreed to impose sweeping sanctions on
Russia's economy and to provide Kyiv with military and financial
assistance. But as the conflict enters a new phase, European unity
is coming under strain.

At the start of the war, a Russian victory seemed likely. But Ukraine
managed to halt the Russian assault on Kyiv, forcing Moscow to focus on
the Donbas and Ukraine's south. Even here, Russia's offensive appears to
have limited momentum. Russia has suffered extensive losses and will
struggle to carry out large-scale offensive operations. At the same
time, Ukrainian forces will find it harder to retake territory than they
did to defend it. Both sides will struggle to achieve a breakthrough.

As the conflict continues, splits between European countries will
deepen. **Divisions over increasing sanctions on Russia are already
highly visible. **It was difficult for the EU to agree on the sixth
package of sanctions at the end of May, especially on Russian oil
imports. To overcome Hungary's opposition, EU leaders had to agree not
to sanction imports via pipeline. It will be even more challenging for
the EU to sanct[ion Russian gas, as member states like Germany, Austria,
and Hungary, which are highly dependent on Russian
gas, ]{.underline}fear they could not cope with a complete cut-off. This
will increase tensions with those member states who argue that gas
revenues are essential in fueling Russia's war effort.

Rifts over strategy are also becoming highly apparent. Eastern EU member
states, particularly Poland and the Baltic states, fear they may be
invaded next if Ukraine loses and are convinced of the need to provide
Kyiv with extensive support to help it prevail. They also think that
negotiations with Russia are pointless, as Putin cannot be trusted to
implement any agreement. Conversely, while western EU states like
France, Germany and Italy have provided ample support to Ukraine, they
think the conflict should end through a negotiation between Russia and
Ukraine, potentially involving some compromises by Kyiv. Western EU
countries don't believe there is a risk that Russia could attack NATO
countries, but instead worry about the risk of the conflict escalating
into a NATO-Russia one.

This western European attitude sparks fears in the hawkish eastern
states that western Europeans are willing to appease Putin and that they
underestimate the threat from Russia. These fears have been compounded
by Germany's delays in delivering weapons to Ukraine. Similarly, French
President Emmanuel Macron's references to the need to avoid humiliating
Russia are seen as signals that he is willing to push Ukraine to make
concessions to Russia, even though he denies this. France, Germany and
Italy have all called for a ceasefire, causing tensions with eastern
member states, who think this would entrench Russian control over parts
of Ukraine.

The battle of attrition in the Donbas may eventually persuade Russia and
Ukraine to agree to a ceasefire. But this could deepen European
differences further. If Russia's advance forced Ukraine to accept
territorial losses as part of an agreement, most EU countries would
favour maintaining the bulk of sanctions to avoid legitimising Putin's
gains. But over time, calls could grow for sanctions to be eased,
deepening divisions.

Conversely, if Ukrainian advances persuaded Putin that it was in his
interest to withdraw from the territories occupied since February, this
could be even more divisive. The hawkish EU states would want to
maintain the sanctions and would reject any attempt to normalise
relations with Russia for as long as Putin was in power. Meanwhile, the
dovish countries would likely favour lifting some sanctions and would
try to rebuild a more stable relationship with Moscow, for example
focusing on arms control talks.

**[The biggest European divisions would occur if Ukraine
was extremely successful in retaking territory.]{.underline}** Putin may
accept losing the territories that Russia has occupied since February,
and perhaps even those parts of the Donbas that Russia has controlled
since 2014. But neither Putin, nor any potential successor, could easily
accept losing Crimea. If faced with such a possibility, Russia would
double down on the war, and the risk of Putin being willing to use
nuclear weapons to force Kyiv to back down would also rise. As CIA
Director Bill Burns recently highlighted in an interview, Putin "doesn't
believe he can afford to lose". Most EU countries would not be
comfortable with such a risky escalation, but some might insist that
Putin is bluffing.

Three months after Russia's invasion, Kyiv's resistance has ensured that
Russia has not achieved its original aim of subjugating Ukraine, but the
war's outcome remains unclear. What is certain is that[ the conflict is
breeding mistrust amongst EU states and that divisions are likely to
deepen further.]{.underline} The risk is that the rifts sparked by the
conflict could become entrenched, undermining European cohesion on
issues well beyond the war in Ukraine and policy towards Russia.

don't experts treat North Korea's cyber-based signals with the same
amount of moderation? Most of North Korea's cyber actions occur against
either South Korea or the United States, usually low-level website
defacements or DDoS signaling campaigns that do not escalate. Between
2000 and 2014, we count a total of 16 cyber operations launched against

### AT: North Korean Cyber

#### No hybrid war

Volume 57, Number 6, December 2015 -- January 2016

[Analysts]{.underline} in the West tend to [think that Russia would
choose [hybrid]{.mark} tactics]{.underline} in order [to sow discord
within NATO -- using ambiguity to create divisions]{.underline} among
allies about what was happening and how to respond -- [and]{.underline}
thus [break the Alliance politically, without firing a
shot]{.underline}.13 [This [scenario]{.mark} reflects well-founded
doubts about Alliance cohesion and unity. It does [**not**
reflect]{.mark} the **[reality]{.mark}** of **Russian strategy**. [An
**extensive search** of]{.mark} Russian [**military writings** produces
**no ev**]{.mark}idence of such considerations]{.underline}. Moreover,
what we do know about [[Russian]{.mark} military [thought
suggests]{.mark}]{.underline} that a [[hybrid war]{.mark} with NATO
[would **not make**]{.mark} **strategic [sense]{.mark}**]{.underline}
from Moscow's perspective. [For the Russian military, [the]{.mark} most
significant [threat]{.mark} in the Baltic region]{.underline},
particularly because of the strategically vulnerable Kaliningrad
exclave, where the Russian Baltic Fleet is based, [[is]{.mark} the
potential [deployment of]{.mark} US [forces]{.mark} and high-end
capabilities. A Russian [hybrid]{.mark} operation [would give]{.mark}
**ample [time]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the US to do just
[that]{.mark}]{.underline}. So, in the time it took for Narva, the
Russian-speaking Estonian border town, to be occupied by the little
green men, the 101st Airborne Division could land in Tallinn and a US
carrier group could set sail for the Gulf of Finland. Moreover, Moscow
has options to prevent this scenario from materialising. For example,
the army, with air support, could rapidly push from the Estonian border
to the Baltic Sea, destroying all Estonian forces and denying the US
access to the region before anyone in Washington or Brussels had the
chance to navel gaze. One Russian analyst noted that it would take
30,000 NATO troops about a month to deploy to the Baltic region, while a
Russian force of three times the size could be sent there in just 24
hours. He concluded that 'while Europe's top brass discuss and argue how
to transit to the theater, and coordinate all of this with \[the US\],
Warsaw, Riga, Tallinn and Vilnius would be transformed into a rubbish
heap'.14 [[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} analysts [have gone]{.underline}
even [further]{.underline} than discerning a doctrine [and now
[claim]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[Russia is **already** conducting
hybrid **war**]{.mark}fare on the West]{.underline}. As one recent
report claimed, 'The various diplomatic, economic, military and
subversive measures that have been employed by Russia in the Baltic
Region and increasingly in the Balkans, Black Sea and Mediterranean
regions, could be interpreted as elements of a protracted campaign
already underway.'15 The author thus equates hard-nosed -- but
commonplace -- tactics to gain influence with subversion that represents
a threat to national security. [But [there is a **major difference**
between efforts to **subvert**]{.mark} a population]{.underline} against
its government on the one hand, [[and]{.mark} the use of
**[normal]{.mark} tools** of [statecraft]{.mark} to gain influence on
the other]{.underline}.16 The former would be, of course, a real problem
for NATO; fortunately, **[[nothing like]{.mark} the [subversion
of]{.mark} eastern [Ukraine is happening]{.mark} inside member states
[today]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As for all the other [unpleasant
[activities]{.mark}]{.underline} that [Russia undertakes]{.underline}
inside NATO and EU member states, such as funding political parties or
developing media in local languages, these [**certainly [do
not]{.mark}** [merit the label]{.mark} 'hybrid']{.underline}, let alone
'war'. After all, [Western countries have been doing many of the same
things inside of Russia for **years**]{.underline}. And no one
considered those activities 'elements of a protracted campaign already
underway'. \* \* \* Three parallels between the developing conventional
wisdom in Russia and the West on hybrid war emerge from the literature.
Firstly, Russian strategists believe that the US is willing to risk
conducting a limited, hybrid operation in Russia -- that is, on the
territory of a nuclear power -- just as NATO strategists believe Russia
is willing to risk the same on the territory of a nuclear alliance.
Secondly, Russian analysts project well-founded fears about their
country's long-term political cohesion onto the West's intentions. In
other words, they know their political system is brittle, so therefore
the Americans must be out to undermine it. In the same way, NATO
analysts know there are divergences regarding threat perceptions inside
the Alliance, so therefore Russia must be planning to take advantage of
them. Finally, each side believes that Ukraine represents the other's
successful hybrid operation, and a potential precursor to such an
operation being directed against it. Fortunately, on all three counts,
[the new **[conventional wisdom]{.mark}** in]{.underline} both Russia
and [the West [is **wrong**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### It doesn't escalate

The Flipside of Deterrence by Punishment -- the Fear of Escalation
[[One]{.mark} of the]{.underline} greatest [**[reservation]{.mark}**s
against communicating a willingness to take punitive actions
[concerns]{.mark} the [risk of **escalation**]{.mark} and increased
tension due to a more assertive]{.underline} or offensive [posture.
[Yet]{.mark} when looking into possible responses -- retaliation in
cyberspace, for example -- a number of [**"self-dampening" mechanisms**
appear]{.mark} to be **[in place]{.mark}** that may be **applicable** to
many types of responses]{.underline}.30 [[One]{.mark} example
[is]{.mark} the requirement to establish]{.underline} some level of
**[[attribution]{.underline}]{.mark}** of aggression on which to base a
response. As discussed above, while attribution is rarely impossible,
[it can be a time-consuming and technically-challenging endeavor. In a
high-stakes scenario the **time** taken]{.underline} to get attribution
as right as possible [means [there will be **plenty of time** to **think
twice**]{.mark} about actions and consequences, [and]{.mark} to **[lean
on diplomatic measures]{.mark}** in **parallel**. [An example]{.mark} of
a self-dampening mechanism [related to]{.mark} the **[cyber]{.mark}**
domain [is]{.mark} the **[large investment]{.mark}** required to develop
credible offensive capabilities. Moreover, an offensive cyber capability
is a **transitory tool**]{.underline}31. [The ability to access a
computer system or network to cause harm or damage is **only temporary**
and **dependent** on a **very rapid and ongoing patching** of
vulnerabilities]{.underline}. At the same time, wielding the cyber
instrument despite the downside of "burning" the capacity might have a
de-escalatory effect by communicating capability and credibility to the
opponent with a view to discouraging future hostile attacks.
[[Targeting]{.mark} in any domain]{.underline} -- including cyberspace
-- [[must]{.mark} also [follow]{.mark} **relevant
[rules]{.mark}**]{.underline}, law and due-process [[which]{.mark} will
**[self-limit]{.mark}** the **range** of **[targets]{.mark}** and
**actions** available.]{.underline} [[A]{.mark} final [**"escalatory
showstopper"** is]{.mark} related to the challenge of **identifying**
and **developing targets** of adequate strategic significance -- **not
too much, not too little** -- to achieve the desired effect. Responding
to hybrid aggression by applying "middle range" punitive
[actions]{.mark} that are **[proportionate]{.mark}** to the aggression
threatened or suffered [will]{.mark} also **[self-limit]{.mark}** the
escalatory potential. [It is **unlikely**]{.mark} to be [in the
**interest** of **any**]{.mark} hybrid aggressor [to pursue
**a**]{.mark}n **escalatory [spiral]{.mark}** above and beyond where
they were looking to compete in the first place: on the hybrid
level]{.underline}. Nevertheless, one way to mitigate the risk of
escalation -- while enhancing civilian oversight and interagency
coordination -- would be to establish rules of engagement for punitive
actions on the hybrid level32 . This would provide decision-makers with
common guidelines to pursue punitive actions that fall below the "use of
force threshold". Moreover, this could actually bolster the credibility
of punitive actions by signaling to hybrid aggressors the intent to take
pre-prepared punitive actions when deemed necessary: in other words, a
"playbook" for countering hybrid threats.

#### No North Korean cyber attacks

Dr. James Andrew **Lewis 17**, Senior Vice President at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, Director of the Technology Policy
Program, PhD from the University of Chicago, "The Likelihood of North
Korean Cyber Attacks", 9/7/2017,

Under what circumstances would it make sense for North Korea's Kim
regime to begin a war with the United States? The primary goal of any
state is survival, and this is even more important for politically
fragile regimes that provide immense benefit to the ruling family. [[An
**upper limit** to]{.mark} North Korean [activities is]{.mark}
that]{.underline}, though it will use threats and coercive acts to
pursue its larger policy goals, [it will not do so at the expense of its
own **[survival]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There is some risk that Kim
Jong-un could miscalculate when it comes to coercive acts. Shooting
missiles over Guam would provoke a reaction, as would an inadvertent
impact on Japanese territory of a missile intended to overfly it. But
[in general, [behind]{.mark} the **[bluster]{.mark}**, the [Kim]{.mark}
regime [has been **calculating** and **careful**]{.mark}. This is the
lens through which we should measure the risk of North Korea launching a
cyber attack]{.underline} against the United States. [**[No]{.mark}**rth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea [is]{.mark} the **[least capable]{.mark}** of our
opponents when it comes to cyber attack]{.underline}. It uses cyber
techniques for coercive diplomacy, for criminal activities to generate
hard currency, and for disruptive actions in the South and against
deployed U.S. forces. If war breaks out, the North might also consider
cyber attacks against military or symbolic targets in the United States.
However, short of armed conflict, [disruptive actions here are
**unlikely**]{.underline}. How disruptive a North Korean cyber attack
would be depends on the victim's weaknesses. North Korean successes
depend on relatively basic techniques that exploit vulnerabilities in
poorly defended systems. [Though the North]{.underline} has used [cyber
attacks]{.underline} several times [against]{.underline} South Korean
[banks and media outlets]{.underline}, and against Sony in the United
States, none of those attacks caused physical destruction or casualties.
To be fair, [no cyber attack has ever caused casualties, and only three
or four resulted in physical damage. **[No]{.mark}**rth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea, [despite progress]{.mark}]{.underline} in developing
its cyber-attack capabilities, [[does **not**
possess]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[advanced skills]{.mark}**
needed]{.underline} to cause physical damage. What the North can do with
cyber operations is disrupt data and online services. A 2011 cyber
attack on a South Korean bank left customers unable to use ATMs or
online services for several days. The action deleted customer accounts
and tried to erase evidence of the attack from the bank's computers.
Similar attacks took place in 2013 against banks and media outlets in
Seoul, with data erased and services disrupted. The 2014 attack on Sony
Pictures also disrupted services and data and saw leaks of embarrassing
e-mails. The most recent North Korean cyber incident used false
credentials to steal \$81 million from the Bangladesh Central Bank.
While these count as successes, they may have also increased North
Korea's caution. If you think you are invisible and suddenly discover
that you are not, it dampens your enthusiasm for crime. The ability of
the United States to identify North Korea in the Sony incident probably
led the North to revise upward the risk of cyber action against U.S.
targets. We can run through one popular scenario to explore how North
Korea might think about cyber attacks. Though [[it is
unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark} that [North Korea [has]{.mark} the
[ability to cause **blackouts**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the United
States, if it did have the capability and decided to use it, this would
not reduce our ability to retaliate militarily. [Blackouts do not
produce catastrophe or military advantage]{.underline}. A cyber-induced
blackout would, however, put the regime's survival at risk---in
diplomatic parlance, this is called poking a bear with a stick. In any
event, [the [notion of]{.mark} cyber [catastrophe is **wildly
exaggerated**]{.mark}, reflecting a **popular culture** prone to
[**exaggerating** risk]{.mark} rather than seriously assessing an
opponent's capability and intent]{.underline}. North Korea uses cyber
attacks to advance its policy agenda; [**[no]{.mark}**ne of its
**[action]{.mark}**s [has been]{.mark} **capricious** or
**[haphazard]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Cyber attacks do not come out of
the blue. They are not random acts (and they are not launched by groups
with funny names) but are calculated to achieve either political or
financial goals. A decision to launch a cyber attack would be made by
Kim Jong-un, and he would consider this in the context of the larger
efforts to manipulate decisionmakers and public opinion in the United
States, Japan, and South Korea. An attack on critical infrastructure
located in the domestic United States would be extremely provocative,
and there are plenty of other provocative things the North can do that
do not create existential risk for the Kim regime. Kim and his advisers
probably know that China and Russia would look unfavorably on a cyber
attack against the United States at this tense juncture, and while the
North may be ready to ignore its patrons in some matters, starting an
armed conflict with the United States is not one of them. It is
commonplace to call [Kim]{.underline} crazy, but his [[decisions are
**rational**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the context of North Korea's
strategic culture. An attack on the United States that the North
believes is likely to be detected, that will not produce significant
harm, and that could generate a damaging response is unattractive. [The
[goal is to manipulate]{.mark}]{.underline} the United States and its
North Asian allies [[without]{.mark} provoking [war, and cyber]{.mark}
attacks]{.underline} on the U.S. homeland, catastrophic or otherwise,
[[run counter]{.mark} to this]{.underline}
